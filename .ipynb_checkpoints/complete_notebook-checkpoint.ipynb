      "With all the newer versions of this movie from the likes of Jim Carrey, and various others it's hard to convince people the old tried and true is the best. Yes this film is in black and white, and yes the transfer quality (probably due to the age of the original) is not quality by modern standards. However, this film actually can't rely on special effects and the actors actually have to act. Both of these are rare by modern standards.I also have to admit I like the direction of the older versions of this film. There are no hammy cheese ball moments just for the sake of having them. I actually felt that Alastair Sim was confronted with his nefarious lifes work, and that he was forced to himself for who he was. The message being that it's not too late to change. Faced with his own mortality the main character finally saw that he couldn't take his money with him, that his exsistance was shallow, and that he was responsible for his own unhappiness. In the end he changed. In this I actually feel this film captures the meaning of the original better than any other I've seen (which I admit I haven't seen them all).So give it try. Put away the modern computerized versions and give real acting a chance.\n",
      "The most remarkable thing about \"A Christmas Carol\" is the way the intrisic morality of the story keeps it evergreen.The film versions seems to refect the values of their time: the 1935 version on the double DVD seems somewhat stale reminder of the remote British Empire, while the 1951 Alastair Sim interpretation has much of the uplifiting cheer of the many English comedies in austere post-war Britain.The evergreen aspects of the film are also found from the 1978 Rich Little send-up of the famous and infamous of his day and the Christmas Eve 2010 \"Dr. Who\" version with Dr. Who playing the spirit of Christmas Past may become a cult film.Time will tell which Christmas Carol is the most enduring. The Alastair Sim offering, apart from the family feel good aire, has a touch of \"Wall Street\" about it as an 18th. century Gordon Gekko greed-is-good charater drives Scrooge's business partners to the wall. Scrooge and Marley coldly demand 51% of the firm to save it from bankrupcy.Sim is well able to use those trademark doe eyes to show an inner cruelty and meanace in a Scrooge on the verge of his lifetime downward spiral into bitter cynicism...an alienation from humanity sealed by the loss of his beloved sister; dying in childbirth as his own mother died giving her birth.Yet this is a story of redemption and Scrooge finds a grace denied Marley. Sim's portrayal of Scrooge makes believable that even the deadest heart may be brought to life.The restored version is well served by low-key black and white, but I didn't go much for the colorized version...the color seemed, to me, to destroy this very mood and a be a pointless gimmick to show how clever the computer technicians were. The main value the included 1935 version was to show the viality of the Sim film.A good DVD to collect.\n",
      "This version of \"A Christmas Carol\" is one of my all time favorite movies.  There are countless adaptations of Dickens' novel, but this one is still my favorite.  First, though it is not the most literally faithful adaptation of the novel, I think it comes closest to expressing Dickens' original themes, especially the idea of imaginative sympathy.  Second, no other actor has come close to topping Alastair Sim's portrayal of Scrooge.  George C. Scott, Albert Finney, and Patrick Stewart perform the role admirably in their versions, but Alastair Sim makes you believe in this character more than any of the others.  In the beginning, he is exactly as Dickens' described him--cold, heartless, and very much alone.  Scrooge's transformation is handled with grace and emotion.  The music perfectly complements the emotional beats.This DVD release is particular is quite a good one.  It contains the original black and white version, and the picture quality is as good as one could expect for a movie that is now more than 50 years old.  There are no special features to speak of, but this is a fine, basic DVD transfer.\n",
      "Alas, for Jacob Marley's ghost when he responds with this line after Scrooge has told him: \"But you were always a good man of business.\"  This English version of *A Christmas Carol*, which has the film title of \"Scrooge,\" has always been the definitve version of the story for me.  The sets, the costumes, the exterior shots, and the actors and actresses all have what seems to me to be a distinctive \"English\" look to them.  Even Tiny Tim's teeth and Alastair Sim's teeth have an English trademark look to them.  This DVD version of this classic film presents an excellent opportunity for the film fan to judge the effect of colorizing on a film.  The DVD presents the original black and white version on one side of the disk, and the colorized version on the other side.  I first saw the film in black and white...and have always thought of it in that fashion.  In that aspect, the black and white presentation offers some interesting aesthetic and dramaticeffects which can be compared with the effects which the colorized version produces.  To my sense perceptions, the black and white version increases the \"coldness\" of the feel of the film...of the snow...and the huddling of people to keep warm...and it seems to increase the perception of Scrooge as a cold person.  Even in scenes where there should be a sense of warmth, such as when Scrooge is in his room huddled in his chair ready to eat some \"hot\" soup, the effect is still one of coldness.  The black and white aspect of sets and people seems to heighten the dramatic impact, making for a solemn, lonely, spiritless feel to the characters and events...which is certainly in keeping with the intent (until the transformation).  Alastair Sim's acting is so profoundly good that he does transform the tone of the black and white into a warmth of reclaimed humanity.  When he goes in humility and some fear to his nephew's house, not knowing how he will be received, and asks forgiveness for his foolishness, the black and white aspect cannot dull the warmth and humanity.  But, that having been said, I must also say that the moment I turned the disk over and began the film in the colorized version, I knew I was experiencing...and was going to experience...a different set of sensory impules...and different resulting feelings and aesthetic impressions.  For the opening sequence is of a book being opened...in the colorized version, the book's cover is colored...but it is tastefully done...and the pages are a warm ivory color.  The effect to me was enormously pleasing...then when the actual characters appear... the colorizing adds to the facial expressions...one now notices arched eyebrows, grimaces, smiles...there is a real humanity that is brought out by the color.  People's personalities are not \"washed out\" by the black and white...the distinctiveness of individual personality seems more alive with the color. This colorized version is done well...the color is tastefully done...the inside of Scrooge's house becomes more distinctive, and one notices objects that tend to go unnoticed in the black and white version.  The brown colored bannisters of the stairway are one example...as well as the statue at the bottom of the stairs.  The wooden surfaces glow with a warm brown... and Scrooge's (Alastair Sim's) eyes are an interesting, mesmerizing ice-blue color.  Formerly I would have said, as something of a film purist, that the black and white version of the film would be the one which I would watch...and show to others.  But now, I have become a real fan of the colorized version...maybe it is the novelty because I have not seen the colorized version as many times as I have seen the black and white version...but I firmly suspect that it is something deeper and more aesthetically and psychologically compelling in relation to the use of color... at least with this film (I once saw a horrible, inept, attempt at colorizing \"Miracle on 34th street\"...but I do not fault this present attempt).  I found nothing wrong with the sound on this disk...  The most haunting moments in this film, for me, are at the beginning when Tiny Tim is looking in the shop window...and the mechanical clown is laughing...Tim laughs too, for he thinks it is in amusement...but then Tim sees someone buy the boat which he obviously wanted...the look of loss and hurt on the young actor's face is unforgettable...and yet the heartless mechanical clown continues to rock back and forth with laughter...now, as if mocking Tim...Tim looks at the clown... and still in his good-hearted spirit manages a smile and a laugh, too.  My god...what an incredible piece of filmed humanity...and feeling.  There are other incredibly moving moments in this filmed version.  For me, it will always be the best.\n",
      "I started watching this movie every Christmas eve with my parents when I was young and still love it today it always puts me in the Christams mood and I love watching it with my kids.\n",
      "This 2-disc restored 1951 edition of the timeless classic is presented in the ORIGINAL 1.37:1 format.  If only other studios would pay the same attention to detail with their \"restored\" movies.  It may seem like a small difference, but where would YOU trim off an equal amount of a famous painting in order to cram what was left into a smaller frame?\n",
      "This is my absolute favorite version of A Christmas Carol and I couldn't let this offer pass by.  This is a holiday tradition in my house and we always waited to see when it was scheduled on television. Now we can enjoy whenever we want to watch,\n",
      "This is the most heart wrenching and inspirational version of Charles Dicken's tale I have ever seen on the screen.  Alistair Sim should have won an Oscar for his portrayal of Scrooge. If you can keep a dry eye when Scrooge revisits his dying sister's bedside--or when he asks his nephew's bride to \"please forgive an old man...\" than you might be as cold as old Scrooge was himself!  And the scene on Christmas morning is glorious--you will find yourself mimicking the dialogue to your family!\n",
      "A masterpiece of film making in every sense of the word, Sim gives one of the best performances ever and I do mean ever as Scrooge. You also get a top notch English cast and a very fine quality film, it's as if the classic book has come alive, you won't ever see a finer version than this one.If you only own one Christmas movie, this is the one to own make no mistake, it still holds up and it still entertains.10 out of 10\n",
      "The best version of the story, in my opinion.Alastair Sim seems like he has transformed himself into the character the Dickens envisioned when he wrote the tale.The transformation is complete, believable and heart warming.Black-and-White is the ONLY way to see this film.If offered a colorized version, throw it away and get the B&W; one!An absolute must, for the holiday season.\n",
      "Ever since I can remember, Christmas hasn't been Christmas without at least one viewing of this film.  Even waaaay back to the days before VCRs and 300 cable channels, living in a small Arkansas town, my brother and I would scour the TV guide that came in the Sunday paper to see if it was coming on one of the three channels we got.  (How did we survive?)I also have the 2002 disc, and comparing them on my setup it's obvious that alot of care has gone into the restoration efforts.  However (here comes the nit-pick)...watch the scene where the door to Scrooge's sitting room flies open in advance of Marley's entrance.  Scrooge leaps up from his chair and cowers against the wall...his mouth is opening BUT YOU CAN'T HEAR HIM UTTER HIS CRY OF FEAR!  This, to me, is shoddy audio engineering...since of course it's loud and clear on the 2002 version.  Someone apparently dropped the audio out when the transfer was being done.  Yes, I know this is a very, very minor point, but it's still a point.  So I actually give the disc creators 4 stars.  If they were as dedicated to the full restoration of this film as the packaging would have us believe, they wouldn't have missed something so trivial.\n",
      "Not only is this Alistair Sim adaptation of a great classic story the best Christmas story of all time, it is also one of the greatest characterizations of all time. Sim as Scrooge is magnificent and unforgettable.\n",
      "A wonderful version of this classic tale, my wife and I enjoyed it immensely.  Black and white is the only way to experience it, highly recommend this classic, brought back childhood memories of Christmas tales.\n",
      "I've seen most of the Christmas Carol movies ever made.  George C. Scott was wonderful.  Albert Finney was good in an overblown movie.  Mickey Mouse and Scrooge McDuck, Muppets, and even Gene Lockhart (whose daughter, June, played one of Cratchit's children).But nothing stands up to this movie.  The added story elements (in Christmas Past) are all in the right vein, and the story builds to a wonderful climax.  I cannot see other movies without thinking of scene after scene from this version.  Alastair Sim IS Scrooge.  And yes, his giddiness after being saved from Christmas Yet-to-come is exhilirating. There are no weak links in this movie.  Mrs. Dilber's astonished \"For me?\" when Scrooge gives her money is just one example of the detail this movie has.  Purists may shudder, but I even like the colorized version.  I can't wait to see the restored version of the Black and White.\n",
      "With all of the limitations of the day, compared with those available to the film-makers of today, there might be a tendency to avoid a mere black-and-white offering.Let me say this, Charles Dickens is unrivaled as a Master of the English language and his ability to bring you into his story is almost magical. Alastair Sim made this story-on-film his own, by the sheer artistry, skill and professionalism for which he will always be remembered.Any film, black and white or otherwise, that combines for us the talents of these two people cannot be less than five-star.Buy this film, enjoy it every year, just like \"It's a Wonderful life\", it is an essential part of a Christmas family celebration.\n",
      "This version of \"A Christmas Carol\" is actually quite different from the written version.  Most of the Ghost of Christmas Past sequences, for example, are not in the original text at all.  However, it is Alistair Sim that makes this this movie so time honored.  He is the epitome of what Ebenezer Scrooge should be.  The supporting characters are played equally well.\n",
      "Admittedly, it all comes down to individual taste in the end but if this isn't the definitive version of \"A Christmas Carol\", I'll go to the foot of our stairs. Alastair Sim is absolutely sublime as the curmudgeonly miser and his redemption is both believable and touching. Now if only they'd done it in Technicolor.\n",
      "A Christmas Classic!  Now I won't have to look for it ever year on television since they usually show the others.\n",
      "I'm 58 years old and have seen all the versions of this movie, and by far this is the greatest. The actors portray their roles with such realism. With this DVD you get the color version as well as the original black and white. No one portays \"scrooge\" like Allistair Simms!!!!\n",
      "Great acting by real actors who knew how to get the audience to believe and feel part of the film\n",
      "This is one of the best versions of A Christmas Carol ever made.  The acting is very good and Mr Sim makes a believable Scrooge.  If you love the classic Christmas movies then this is a must have for your collection. There are no surprises in the story,just the story we have all enjoyed over the years.  Getting the color and B/W versions is an extra bonus.\n",
      "This movie was for my husband who had trouble finding it every Christmas for this version....he loves it, and I am pleased to have it to watch with him.\n",
      "This is a wonderful and faithfful rendering of Dickens' priceless masterpiece. Alistair Sim's performance is really  inspired.The story is absolutely relevant and indispensable for all of us in this culture today. It is a primer providing the basis for what we need to know to lead a good and beneficial life.\n",
      "When I first started looking to see if I could get hold of a DVD of A Christmas Carol I did not hold much hope in find one, but to my total amazement low and behold I now have one of the best Classics to come out of British Film. If you have never seen this movie then I personally recomend it last time I saw it was when I was 13yrs old a very long time back then it was only in Black & White so my hats off to Amazon and your great service many thanks for a life time of veiwing that my Grand & Great Grand kid can now enjoy watching with me.Regards Allan J Savage (Down Under in Australia)\n",
      "To voice a single \"humbug\": this 1951 British classic was resourcefully filmed in black and white, and including a colorized version is a dubious pretext for swelling the package into two DVD's.  On the plus side, doubling the size of this definitive edition accommodates some welcome extras, including informative interviews and commentaries and the 1935 \"Scrooge,\" which is of historic interest for the performance of Sir Seymour Hicks, who debuted on the London stage as early as the 1880s.  As for the \"uncolorized\" 1951 version, those who share my conviction that this is the most truly \"Dickensian\" of all films will rejoice in the superlative restoration in this package.  Visual nuances like pictures on walls - and their equally significant absence - are suddenly apparent, and the inimitable characterization of Alastair Sim is vividly confirmed.  Accept no substitutes for this new edition.\n",
      "This double disc set of the classic \"A Christmas Carol\" has been restored to it's original glory. The picture and sound quality has been cleaned up and it looks and sounds great. You actually get three versions of the film here, the restored \"pan and scan\" version, the restored \"widescreen\" version and the useless \"colorized\" version. If you're a fan of colorized movies you may appreciate it, but for me movies that have been colorized just look very cheesy. Also included is a 1935 take on the story.\"A Christmas Carol\" has been made and remade many times, this version with Alastair Sim is considered by many to be the definitive version. I've always liked George C. Scott's take on the role in the 1980's TV movie version. This 1951 version however is the classic. Fans won't be dissapointed.\n",
      "This is my favorite version of \"A Christmas Carol\" even though it has been re-done by several others. George C. Scott comes close, but Alastair Sim made the best Scrooge (in my humble opinion). Great edition to my DVD collection.\n",
      "This 2nd upgrade from the first bluray release of this movie is a bigger upgrade.Wish they could get it right the first time though.The picture looks amazing and the extras on this disc are great.If you don't mind having two copies if you bought the first round you won't be disappointed\n",
      "I liked the idea of including both the colorized and black and white versions in this two DVD set so that you have the choice of which to watch.  There is also much bonus material, including a biography video of Dickens and an older version of \"A Christmas Carol\" from the 1930's.  The only problem with this set is the uneven restoration of both the black and white and colorized films. One moment the picture will be clear and the next it will be fuzzy.  At least that's the way it appears on my TV set when played on my good quality DVD player.  This 1951 film is a great classic but I have seen better, more consistent restoration of older films.  The movie was very enjoyable in both black and white and colorized versions, but more could have been done with making the movie look new again, considering what is available for restoration with today's technology.I read somewhere that Dickens' own granddaughter recommended this film as the finest movie version.  Alastair Sim was the best Scrooge, but Patrick Stewart's 1999 film is well worth seeing as a newer version of this classic since it is also very accurate to the book.\n",
      "One of the greatest Christmas movies ever made. I watch this movie many times during the Christmas season.\n",
      "Our family tradion was always to watch this movie from age 10 until a couple of years ago the tv station quit airing it on christmas eve. My children are now grown and they missed it too. Glsd I have my own copy.\n",
      "This 50 year old Christmas Carol is still the best one. The ghost of Scrooge's dead partner is terrifying. The special effects are amazing considering how old they are. The acting is wonderful, not over or under played. The story is truly captured in this film.\n",
      "this particular film has been my family's favorite for many, many years.  but it wasn't available for home playing.  now it's available and we no longer need to search for it on t.v.  quality is unquestionably a ten.as always, i'm so impressed with how quickly I receive my merchandise.\n",
      "While this film is very faithful to the elements of Dickens' narrative it takes many liberties with inventing other scenes wholesale.  Some may help to explain certain situations, such as how Scrooge and his father came to be estranged and why Scrooge holds a grudge against Fred.  But others seem unnecessary such as the subplot concerning the hostile takeover of Fezziwig's.  Nevertheless this film is a definite fan favorite and is very well produced.  The roles of Jacob Marley, Bob Cratchit, Mrs. Dilber and of course Alastair Sim as Scrooge are especially well-acted.  You can read in more detail a comparison of this and other film treatments of Dickens' A Christmas Carol at dickenscroogemovies dot com.\n",
      "I recall other movie versions of A Christmas Carol, and some plays I have seen, that portray Scrooge as a colorful but essentially harmless curmudgeon.  When I saw Alastair Sim play the part for the first time I understood  that Scrooge is no cute old man.  He is terrifying, a monster, a villain, a force for evil.  When Dickens explains that the blind man's dog drags him away from Scrooge, you have trouble picturing this image, until you see Sim in the role.  This version is simply masterful.  The added material (not in the novella) is consistent with the original story and gives insight into Scrooge's character. The acting throughout is strong but never over the top.  For example Brian Worth is convincing as Fred in his jovial nature and patience with his uncle.  Certainly Kathleen Harrison gives a masterful performance as Mrs. Dilber, with her ghoulish attempt to benefit from Scrooge's death and her colorful response to Scrooge's conversion.  This movie, like the novella, works because it captures the extremity of despair in the poverty of Victorian England and the brutal inhumanity of the main character and then effectively transforms both to joy and optimism, somehow believably, through the miracle of Christmas.  The transformation is convincing and the reborn Scrooge, as portrayed by Sim, is as convincing as a benevolent patriarch as he was as a heartless scoundrel.  The dark scenes at the beginning and middle of this film can be hard to watch for the faint hearted.  Nevertheless the genius of the film is that the impact of the end of the film is stronger because of the sadness and despair shown earlier in the film.  If one softened the despair the ending would be much less effective.  There may be other decent versions of this story, but I plan to stick with this one for Christmases in the foreseeable future.\n",
      "I have been watching this movie since I was a child in the 60s. Never have I ever seen such a magnificent job of restoration of a classic film. Not only is the picture unbelievable the audio is perfectly restored as well. Watching this in Blu-ray is like watching it through a new set of eyes. I watched it on a 50 inch Pioneer Elite plasma screen with an LG 390 player. I just received it today the 23rd of December, I paid extra to have it shipped overnight. No Christmas in the past 30 plus years will be Christmas without having watched this film. The restoration is so clear that I have seen detail in this version I have never noticed before. For instance, if you carefully watch the scene after the last ghost has departed and Scrooge has awakened and is conversing with his char woman, just after he says \" I feel as giddy as a drunken Man\", he steps toward his dressing mirror. You can see a man's face reflected in the mirror and slowly peek out of the shadows. Most likely a stage hand or lighting grip who got in the way and had to duck back into the curtains. They kept the scene intact, how could they possibly improve upon that take. Back then they probably figured no one would ever notice, they didn't fathom the development of Blur-Ray. I have never been able to see such detail before. This restoration is simply amazing and well worth the money. Merry Christmas!\n",
      "This is the all time best Scrooge movie. No doubt. Scrooge aficionados will agree on that. Although George C Scott did a good job in his version, but I digress. This is faithful to black and white. Razor sharp video, good audio. When i got a VCR, I bought the tape. When i got a DVD, I bought the DVD, and now Blu Ray. This is the sharpest picture of all. Even non techies commented on sharpness.But the mystery continues on who played the part of the maid answering the door in nephew Fred's house. \\A good remaster. Do not expect colorization even though the cover is in color. This is a movie that does not benefit by colorization anyway.\n",
      "I have always liked alastair sim as scrooge. I also have one with George C. Scott and Patrick Stewart. Each one is a good movie in its own way, but with Alastair Sim is the only way to go.\n",
      "The reason I love this film version of \"Christmas Carol\" is, quite simply, Alastair Sim's performance.  Frankly, some of the supporting cast can be a bit wooden, but Sim's snarly miser is pitch-perfect.Not only does he nail the mean Scrooge--which most decent actors in the part have managed well enough--but he makes the joyful Scrooge, the redeemed Scrooge, the Scrooge ecstatic at the chance to right wrongs he believed beyond hope, live as vividly as the caricature of the stingy old grumpus.  Of all the myriad film and stage versions, this is certainly not the one that hews closest to the original text, but it is the one the gets the trickiest and most important aspect of the story right.  You can truly believe in Scrooge's change of heart when Sim's playing it.\n",
      "This is a great DVD!  We enjoy seeing it, as is our tradition, each Christmas season.  We also appreciated the fact that we could pick between color or black and white, and screen size.  We were definitely not disappointed.\n",
      "The black and white version of A Christmas Carol with Alastair Sim from the 50's is the best ever made. We watch it every Christmas. It is so much better than any other I have seen and stands the test of time. This is a good print and we were thrilled to add it to our collection.\n",
      "This is the only version of remakes that I will watch.  Alastair Sim was the perfect person for this role.  Each character is believable and even though you know what happens year after year, you can't help but love Scrooge at the end.\n",
      "A wonderful presentation of a wonderful movie. A beautiful print and lots of interesting extras. We've enjoyed watching a less than perfect print for many years, now we can see it in all its glory. Perfect!\n",
      "A Christmas Carol [Blu-ray] [1951] [Region A] [US Import] Alastair Sim's tour-de-force performance as the ultimate miser, Ebenezer Scrooge, has almost single-handedly made this beloved version of Charles Dickens' story into one of the best-loved Christmas films of all time. Some of Britain's best filmmakers united behind Sim, who was joined by a delightful cast of accomplished and acclaimed English actors; creating what many today believe to be the best and most faithful production of Dickens' immortal tale.Cranky and curmudgeonly Scrooge learns the error of his unkind ways and is taught the true meaning of the holidays when he is visited by the ghost of his late business partner and the spirits of Christmas past, present and future.This Blu-ray edition has been digitally restored from a new 1080p, 24fps high definition transfer master produced from the 35mm negative and fine grain.Cast: Alastair Sim, Kathleen Harrison, Mervyn Johns, Michael Hordern, Hermione Baddeley, John Charlesworth, Glyn Dearman, George Cole, Rona Anderson, Patrick Macnee, Carol Marsh, Francis de Wolff and Miles MallesonDirector: Brian Desmond HurstProducer: Brian Desmond HurstScreenplay: Noel LangleyComposer: Richard AddinsellCinematography: C.M. Pennington-RichardsResolution: 1080pAspect Ratio: 1.37:1Audio: English: 5.1 Surround Sound and 1.0 LPCM Mono AudioSubtitles: English and SpanishRegion: Region A/1Number of discs: 2Running Time: 86 minutesStudio: VCI EntertainmentAndrew’s Blu-ray Review – Over the course of film history, few literary characters have been resurrected more often than Charles Dickens' legendary miser and Christmas killjoy, Ebenezer Scrooge. Several esteemed actors, from Reginald Owen and Albert Finney to George C. Scott and Michael Caine, have barked at Bob Cratchit, growled \"humbug,\" and giddily danced a jig - all with a fair degree of relish. Yet one Scrooge consistently stands apart from the pack. Alastair Sim never achieved much renown in America, but in Britain he was a pretty big deal, a deft character actor with a basset hound face, a mellifluous voice, and a gallery of bemused expressions. Alastair Sim enlivened many a dreary feature, and if a vote were ever taken to crown the quintessential Scrooge, he would surely win. His take on the crusty curmudgeon who's transformed by three ghosts into a benevolent softie one cold Christmas Eve in Victorian London remains iconic, and the version of 'A Christmas Carol' in which he appears is required viewing for countless families each holiday season.Americans especially revere Dickens' time-honoured tale, but it's no surprise the most engaging adaptation of 'A Christmas Carol' comes from its native England. There's just something about this 1951 version that screams authenticity. Yes, liberties were taken with the original novel, but the mood, atmosphere, and characterizations remain a cut above other films. Noel Langley, one of the writers of 'The Wizard of Oz,' fashions a tight screenplay, and director Brian Desmond Hurst combines whimsy and melancholy with a hint of creepiness that honours the yarn's ghost story roots. The black-and-white photography enhances the darker elements of the story, adding welcome tension, and the production design exudes a distinctly British look and feel that help immerse us in mid-19th century London.A wealthy yet bitter man who would rather count his money than his blessings, Ebenezer Scrooge retires to his stark, run-down flat on Christmas Eve, seven years to the day after his unscrupulous business partner, Jacob Marley [Michael Hordern], passed away. A paranormal disturbance, however, in the form of Marley's chain-laden ghost, interrupts his tranquil evening. The celestial Marley warns Scrooge that unless he alters his selfish and greedy ways, he is doomed to endure a similar restless, tortured afterlife. The only way Scrooge can possibly prevent such a horrible fate is to meet with three spirits, who will try to humanize the irascible miser by revisiting his troubled past, looking at his unhappy present, and pondering his uncertain future.All the character actors who portray the supporting parts are perfectly cast, right down to arguably the least annoying and saccharine Tiny Tim [Glyn Dearman] in any version of 'A Christmas Carol.' Yet despite their excellent work, they can't compete with Alastair Sim. His Scrooge resonates so strongly because he's always disarmingly real. A palpable sadness and air of regret seem to swirl just beneath the surface of his scowls and sneers, so we sense his vulnerability and root for him much sooner, and his ultimate transformation seems more believable because, deep down, it seems to be something Scrooge sincerely craves.Brian Desmond Hurst's film employs some rudimentary special effects and adopts a darker tone than most, but relies on good old-fashioned storytelling and top-flight acting to put over this beloved yuletide tale. If you crave flash, music, Muppets, or 3D, there are plenty of other adaptations of 'A Christmas Carol' to tickle your fancy, but if you like your Dickens neat, with no frills or embellishments and lots of heart and substance, then this 1951 production is the one for you...and will be for many Christmases to come. God bless it, everyone!Blu-ray Video Quality – At first glance, the 1080p image transfer for this 60th Anniversary Diamond Edition of 'A Christmas Carol' doesn't look much different than the one on the 2009 Blu-ray, but upon closer inspection I'd have to say it makes a few subtle improvements. Clarity is ever-so-slightly enhanced and contrast appears a bit more pronounced, lending the image more vibrancy. Black levels are superb, with marvellous shadow delineation emphasizing the film noir feel of many scenes. The snowy whites also hold up well, maintaining their texture in varying degrees of light. Not surprisingly, grain is fairly pronounced, but seems similar to the previous version; some scenes exhibit more than others, but it never overwhelms the picture. Close-ups are quite nice, often highlighting Alastair Sim's large, expressive eyes, and background elements exude a fair degree of detail. If you're thinking of upgrading your copy of 'A Christmas Carol' based solely on video quality, I'd say it isn't worth it. The enhancements aren't notable enough to merit the expense. But when coupled with the new audio and supplements (both described below), trading in your old copy for this new edition makes good sense.Blu-ray Audio Quality – VCI Entertainment puts out some great flicks on home video, but the company needs some better quality control when it comes to advertising the contents of its discs. Aside from the plethora of new supplements (described below). Unfortunately, the audio options on this Blu-ray are not up to the standards set by the generally excellent image quality. The Two Digital mixes are included, the English: 5.1 Surround Sound and the 1.0 LPCM Mono Audio. Both choices sadly leave quite a bit to be desired. I frankly couldn't stand listening to the 5.1 for very long, as it is saddled with such bad chorusing and reverb that I personally found it unlistenable, that is why I have informed you above that it is best to set your amplifier to Stereo. That same chorusing effect is still apparent, though less bothersome, in the original mono track. The original track, while not egregiously damaged, has noticeable hiss and an overall boxy sound that is evident throughout both dialogue and underscore, though that problem is widely variable. For instance, the opening bass-heavy brass music sounds pretty acceptable, but then the first patch of dialogue has an over- reverbed sound. That use of reverb is similarly variable, and seems to abate once the film moves into its more intimate, interior sections. The 5.1 mix manages a few ambient surround moments, notably some of the music and foley effects during the Spirits' appearances, but there are really no \"wow\" moments in the surround repurposing.Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:Introduction By Leonard Maltin [5:06] Leonard Maltin talks about what an impression this film made on him as a kid, and also gives some background on the film. A word of warning, in the menu it says that it is in 5.1 Surround Audio, well do not have your amplifier set this way, you must have it as Stereo, as in the 5.1 Surround Sound Audio, you get a terrible echo sensation and is very off putting.Commentary by Marcus Hearn and George Cole – Without a doubt, the most disappointing aspect of this disc is the 2005 audio commentary by Marcus Hearn and George Cole, who plays the young Scrooge in the film. One would think Cole would have lots to impart about the film's production and its cast, but amazingly, only about a quarter of the discussion has anything at all to do with 'A Christmas Carol'; the rest focuses on Cole's career before and after the film, other British actors with whom he worked, random thoughts about Alastair Sim, and observations about making films in general. We do learn 'A Christmas Carol' was shot in the summer and many scenes were modelled after illustrations from the original book, and that the movie received mixed reviews upon its initial release. Cole talks about his close personal relationship with Alastair Sim, and how the actor mentored him, and calls director Brian Desmond Hurst \"very flamboyant.\" More scene specific remarks would have been welcome, as well as biographical information about the cast, and facts about Dickens and the original novel. This very shoddy effort left me wondering... Why bother to have a commentary at all if the participants are going to largely ignore the film they've been enlisted to discuss? No one with any interest in 'A Christmas Carol' should waste their time listening to this rambling, unfocused mess.Dead to Begin With: The Darker Side of a Classic [26:31] British Film Culturalist Sir Christopher Frayling offers an extensive examination of the film and how it ties into the turbulence afflicting post-war Britain at the time of its initial release. He talks about, among other things, the underrated work of director Hurst, the versatility of Sim, the importance of seasoned character actors to make Dickens' novels come alive, the ominous music score, and rudimentary special effects. Frayling believes this is a darker telling of the tale than most adaptations and also more adult and substantive. Clips from other film versions of 'A Christmas Carol' from the silent era onward enhance this absorbing and comprehensive piece that's well worth a look. In fact, this featurette is so good, it begs the question... Why wasn't Frayling asked to do the commentary instead? In 26:31, we learn far more about 'A Christmas Carol' than the commentary tells us in triple the amount of time!Scrooge by Another Name: Distributing 'A Christmas Carol [9:47] Film distributor Richard Gordon reminisces about financing and marketing 'A Christmas Carol,' and how producer George Minter set out to make the definitive version of Dickens' classic. Because the movie ended up darker and more serious than other adaptations, it was more difficult to distribute in the U.S., which sought more family-oriented fare during the holiday season.The Human Blarney Stone: The Life and Films of Brian Desmond Hurst [41:14] Allan Esler Smith, the great-great nephew and biographer of Hurst, chronicles the life and career of the underrated and largely underappreciated director of 'A Christmas Carol' in this reverent documentary. More film clips illustrating Hurst's work would have been nice, along with more personal details, but the piece succeeds in shedding light on a figure who accomplished much more than directing a renowned holiday film.Alastair Sim Version: Too Good to Be Shown Only at Christmas [32:00] Fred Guida, author of 'A Christmas Carol and Its Adaptations,' provides an insightful and absorbing audio lecture accompanied by film clips and stills from a wealth of Dickens movies. Again, much more interesting and informative than the audio commentary, this piece covers the Dickens renaissance that began with David Lean's 'Great Expectations,' adaptations of 'A Christmas Carol' from other countries, the complex character of Scrooge and how this film meticulously reflects it, how the screenplay altered and embellished various scenes from the original novel, the contributions of the fine supporting cast, and quotes both positive and negative reviews of the picture. Fans of this version definitely don't want to miss this enlightening featurette.Scrooge (Silent) [10:17] This surprisingly entertaining - albeit very brief - silent version of 'A Christmas Carol' was produced in 1922, but not shown in the U.S. until 1929. Henry Vernon Esmond portrays Scrooge, and the lively film efficiently hits all of the story's high points. Video quality is pretty good for a 90-year-old antique.Bleak House (Silent) [10:14] Dame Sybil Thorndike stars as Lady Dedlock in this (very) truncated 1922 adaptation of Dickens' novel. The acting and filming styles recall the old melodramas of yore, but this is still a fun curio that's worth checking out.Theatrical Trailers [4:00] Both the Original British and American Trailers are included. Each runs about 2 minutes, and it's interesting to note the differences between them, most notably that the American trailer continually emphasizes the film's festive and joyous aspects, while the British trailer provides a more balanced look at the movie. One thing that I thought was bad is the original British trailer, I feel they should of spent some money in upgrading this, especially as it is such a Classic British Film.Scrooge Revisited – This short piece looks at some of the actual London locations where 'A Christmas Carol' was shot, and shows how they look today.Campbell Playhouse: A Christmas Carol [59:22] Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, one of America's fondest holiday traditions was the annual Christmas Eve radio broadcast of 'A Christmas Carol,' starring actor Lionel Barrymore as Ebenezer Scrooge. (Barrymore was scheduled to reprise his popular role in MGM's 1938 film version, but an injury forced him to bow out, paving the way for Reginald Owen to portray Scrooge.) Here we have the rare opportunity to enjoy one of Barrymore's signature broadcasts, with a young, pre-'Citizen Kane' Orson Welles as narrator. This very faithful adaptation originally aired on December 24, 1939, and is well-acted, atmospheric, and quite involving. Just listening to the distinctive voices of Barrymore and Welles is a treat!Finally, when I first heard about the re-release of 'A Christmas Carol' a mere two years after its first Blu-ray go-around, but I'm pleased to report this 60th Anniversary Diamond Edition is a big step up from its 2009 counterpart. Improvements include slightly better video and audio track, and a cavalcade of well-produced, substantive extras. The film itself, of course, remains a timeless classic - endearing, inspiring, festive, and just dark enough to add sufficient impact to its themes of redemption and renewal. There never was and never will be a better Scrooge than Alastair Sim and this excellent production showcases his iconic performance to perfection. So toss that old Blu-ray aside and pick up this much-improved anniversary edition that's a fitting tribute to one of the world's finest holiday movies. I have of course found this the ultimate version and I am now so proud to add this to my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!Andrew C.

      "Every Christmas holiday a whole slew of Christmas Carol films come out with varying degrees of quality. They go back to the cruder days of film, up to modern versions implementing special effects. The film that achieves that right balance between good special effects and effective atmosphere is the 1951 version of a Christmas Carol. The film creates  a realistic portrayal of England in Dicken's time. The film makers portray the streets as rather dark and lonely. The only life seems to be in the window of a toy store where 19th century toys are displayed  in their glory. It seems to be Tiny Tims favorite window. Alastair Sim plays Scrooge to the extremes. Scrooge here is seen as a greedy and cynical. When he goes to his front door is greeted by a knob in the shape of Bob Marly's face.  He merely dismisses  it as a result being fatigued.No complex CGI was needed, just basic overlapping film. The lack of technical finesse actually makes it more scary. This whole film shows the effectiveness of old world cinema craftsmanship. In many ways this film could be considered a horror movie. The ghosts are faint, but their screams and echoes  that rumble through the house are unforgettable.What sets this movie s part from the other Christmas films is the authentic view of Victoian England, and it is not a romanticized version. It is especially creepy how the ghosts roam the dark corridors of the house. Marely`s ghost is especially disturbing, his voice during normal conversation is agreeable, but during distress he gives out a moan that will forever live in the spiritual world.Even if most of this film was done on a soundstage, it is so effective in creating industrial English that you barely notice. Alastair Sim shows his versatility as actor by giving a brilliant transformation from Scrooge to a man filled with the spirit of Christmas\n",
      "Very pleased with CD. Fast delivery and in perfect condition. Great having the two versions, black and white and colorized. Great movie version of Dickens classic tale.\n",
      "We were very happy with our order that included the movie A Christmas Carol.  We're excited that it has more than one version.  This is one of, if not, our favorite Christmas movies.\n",
      "This is the most wonderful Christmas movie - it has been a tradition in our family for several generations!  Every Christmas eve our family gathers to watch!!\n",
      "For me, this is the ultimate A Christmas Carol.  For long years, before and after video recording, I was desperate each Christmas season to catch this on television, and of course I came to add  video tapes, and lazer disks of this to my subsequent collections.  But this new Blu Ray DVD is simply beyond anything I ever imagined.  The clarity of the picture and sound, the gorgeous contrast, the wealth of new visible and audible detail in every scene is overwhelming.  This is a magnficent film.  Those unfamiliar with it will come to love it, as they treasure Alastair Sim's remarkable portrayal of Scrooge. And there is not a wasted face or voice in the rest of the film.  All Dickens' characters --- from Tiny Tim to Old Fezziwig to Mrs. Dilber  --- are brought to life with perfection.  ---Also  worth noting: one of the  things that distinguishes this version is a plausible and compelling backstory for Scrooge which is not in the original novel by Dickens.  These  sensitive and subtle additional scenes --  filling out Scrooge's early life --- resonate beautifully with the original material.  They only add, never detract. George Cole, who portrays the younger Scrooge looks credibly enough like Alastair Sim to make the material all the more effective.  The music in this film is tender, beautiful and haunting, especially the Barbara Allen theme connecting Scrooge's sister Fan with Scrooge's  later, post transformation, visit to his neglected nephew and his lovely wife.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  If you love Dickens you must have this. If you love British film, you must have this.  And it will make a fabulous Christmas present for those who have not yet discovered it, or who long to see it again.  We'll be playing Scrooge  every Christmas season in my house as we have done for years, only with renewed enthusiasm and enjoyment, thanks to this stunning restoration.  Also recommended: David Lean's Great Expectatons and Oliver Twist. Perhaps we'll see Blu Rays of those soon, but until then the latest versions are well worth it to experience Dickens on the screen.\n",
      "We watch this black and white movie each year as part of our holiday tradition.  Recently our VHS player died, so we replaced the movie with this DVD.  It arrived in perfect condition, and had a lot of neat extra feature, like commentary that were unheard of in VHS days!  So I'm very pleased with the DVD.  I was worried because the cover of the DVD is colorized.  But happily the movie is still the original B&W!  Thanks!\n",
      "I have been collecting versions of this movie for years and this is still my favorite.  Alastair Sim is the ultimate Scrooge.\n",
      "I have been looking for this for several years. Bought another version that was fluff. This is the movie that really describes Scrooge's transformation, without any ironic tone.\n",
      "There have been many versions of Charles Dicken's classic Yuletide novel, \"A Christmas Carol,\" but none so beautifully acted and with such amazing cinematography as the Alastair Sim offering.  Although little known in this day and age, he was nevertheless one of the better actors of his time.  His classical roots and depth of range make him one of the most versatile actors to be found in film of the time period.The story is one you probably already know, but few really capture the translation from book to film quite so accurately as this version.  Also, as much as I admire the efforts of other wonderful actors (Patrick Stewart, Michael Caine, etc.), I truly believe Alastair Sim captures best the complete scope of Scrooge.  He perfectly conveys the inner being of Scrooge from early on as the \"squeezing, wrenching, grasping, clutching, covetous old sinner\" to the reformed father figure who was, \"as good a master and as good a man as the good old city or any other good old city ever knew.\"  From facial expressions, to body motions, to inflexions and vocal tricks, he is unsurpassed as the best Scrooge ever.The supporting cast, while again not well-known in the Hollywood circles (remember, though, this film was made in the UK), shines as brightly as Sim in their respective roles.  Look for Patrick Macnee of \"The Avengers\" fame as the young Jacob Marley, one of the few other recognizable names in the States.  (I would have to imagine that in the UK and possibly in Europe, many more of the supporting actors and actresses are more famous, so I do not mean to slight them in any way, merely that they are not as well-known here in the States).I can say with certainty that you need not rent this one first to preview its quality.  I would highly recommend to any fan of Dickens, A Christmas Carol, British cinema, holiday classics, or just good family-safe films, to pick up this DVD and add it to your collection.  A very Merry Christmas to you all!\n",
      "This brought back all of my Christmas memories as a child.  I prefer the black and white version to the colorized one.  This was a bargain as you received both the black and white DVD and the colorized DVD. Excellent.\n",
      "Although the title is wrong. This movie is actually called \"Scrooge\" and NOT A Christmas Carol. This 1951 version starring Alastair Sim in the title role, is my favorite version of all time. Much as Sean Connery is the only Bond, Alastair is the only Scrooge for me.I have collected many versions of this movie from the early VHS days to this new Blue Ray version. I have to say I was very impressed by the print and quality. The Sound is also very good. I have watched a 16mm print of this movie years ago and what always impressed me about that print was the depth and atmosphere created by film and the focus grain being visible. I also noticed on the Blue Ray the same focus grain, which to me just enhances the experience of this classic.I would recommend this Movie on Blue ray to any potential buyer. As a life long fan of this movie I got just what I wanted, the ultimate version for all time.Buy it you won't be disappointed.I have enjoyed reviewing this release and will review more movies if Amazon send me free copies.....\n",
      "This is best and will always be the best movie adaptation of A Christmas Carol.  Nothing else has to be said.  A must for your DVD collection!\n",
      "I no longer look for \"A Christmas Carol\" when I look in my library for this film at Christmastime.  I look for Alistair Sim.  He makes the film, and it is the standard by which all other adaptations of this wonderful and uplifting story are judged (and fail, I might add).  I've watched this excellent tale dozens times and still get choked up when he \"comes to his senses.\"If you are looking for a worthwhile film to bring before the family at Christmas time - for a film which brings the spirit of Christmas to the forefront - this is the one and only version of Dickens' story you should consider.This along with \"A Christmas Story\" (the BB gun movie), Miracle on 34th Street (the Edmund Gwenn version)and \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" are always shown in our home at Christmas.It does sadden me that we so often need to go back decades to find a film which brings something other than the morally bankrupt stories we most frequently see today.Buy it.  You'll love it!\n",
      "Of all the \"Scrooge\" movies made, I have always thought this one was the best.  Great acting.\n",
      "Alisar Sim gives an outstanding production as Scrooge in this version of Christmas Carol. This version attempts to fill in the missing pieces of what caused Ebenezer Scrooge to become a miser in the first place. His bitterness against her sister's husband as being the cause of her death led him to walk out before she was able to give her final request to look after her son. The movie is broadcast in other formats but it does contain an interest bio of Alisar Sim by not only those who knew him but by other cast members as well. Of all the versions I've seen this once is truly the best made.\n",
      "This was the perfect gift to give someone who loves the Holliday Season and especially Dickens.  It had everything I thought it would have.  Have a nice day.  That's it.\n",
      "I haven't seen this version in a long time and it's my favorite. The dvd is great quality and lots of interesting facts about the movie and actors and crew as well. I am very glad I got it.\n",
      "Although there are several versions of the Christmas Carol, this one by Sim is considered to be the very best.  The absence of the technology we see today didn't hamper this production.  One must remember the age of this presentation in order to really appreciate it.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite Christmas movies and I was happy to see it on DVD!!!\n",
      "Every year I watch the 20 or so movies I associate with Christmas.  Though not all are actually about the holiday or its origin, they all have something to do with the feelings and meaning attached to it.One of the most important stories about Christmas, and the one that is most often credited with shaping it for modern society is Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol.\"  There are several versions of it, all to a greater or lesser degree faithful to the original tale, and I enjoy many of them, each for what it has to offer.One of the earlier versions of \"A Christmas Carol,\" though by no means the first, is one of my favorites by Alistair Sim.  It presents the usual costume and pageantry of the 19th century venue of the original story, and because it is in the black and white filmation of its own era (1951), captures the essence of early modern dramatic cinema as well: the careful attention to light and dark, to textures and to the meaning of objects in space, the novel camera angles, all of which capture the mystical character of the story and the dark emotional elements of its message of damnation and salvation, the whole point of the story. All of these cinematic aspects effectively create a delightful \"event\" for the viewer.Alistair Sim was a marvelous choice for the role.  He manages to capture the growth and redemption of the character and so expertly walks the thin line between loathsome and pitiable that we are fully able and willing to see ourselves in him--which is again what the author intended.  His shear exuberance and physical joy is wonderful to behold, and the effect of its unexpectedness on others who know him well is delightful.  I look forward every year to the shriek of his housekeeper as she throws her apron over her face and races for the stairs, fleeing undoubtedly for her life.  In fact all of the auxiliary characters are wonderfully portrayed.  One of my favorite scenes is that in which the rag man receives stolen goods from the scullery maid, the housekeeper and the undertaker.  Those of you who remember the series Maude will find in this film a very young and beautiful Mrs. Naugatuck, Herminone Baddley, as Mrs. Cratchet, and those who enjoyed the old series The Avengers will also see a very young Patrick MacNee.  In all the film is a delight, and I watch it every year.For fun examples of later remakes, I suggest:  The Albert Finney musical versionScrooge, the Muppet Theater musical/animation versionThe Muppet Christmas Carol - Kermit's 50th Anniversary Edition, and the superb dramatic version starring George C. ScottA Christmas Carol.Wonderful.\n",
      "It's not Christmas without Alastair Simms.  Favorite of my Mothers - and one of mine too.  A must have for your collection.\n",
      "As far as I am concerned this is the best ever version of A Christmas Carol.  Spare and dark, it exactly captures the essence of Dicken's England.  We watch it every Christmas.\n",
      "I've watched this movie since I was a kid.  It never gets old and now I can watch it in July if I want.  What a GREAT film version.\n",
      "Really worth it to see this version.  Yes, it is old and best viewed in black and white, but it is also the best portrayal of the story of Ebenezer Scrooge!  I think everyone should see this version of \"A Christmas Carol.\"\n",
      "I don't know any of the actors, but this is the best version of the story to watch. Grew up watching this version and after comparing it to all the others, this guy is the best scrooge.  Also the atmosphere comes off dark, yet has a light humor to it.  We all know what its about but if you haven't seen this one I guarantee you'll like it.\n",
      "This 1951 version of \"Scrooge\" with Alistair Sim is still the best in my estimation. This should be excellent for year-round viewing instead of being seen only on the Christmas holidays. An eternal message of greedy lust for gold over a concern for the fellow human race.\n",
      "This is one of few movies to tell the original Dickens tale true to form. Personally, I didn't like the George C. Scott version at all. My favorite is the 1970 version starring Albert Finney as a musical. But Alastair Sim as the sinister old Scrooge in this 1951 version is a must for any classic movie buff.I chose this double movie offer, both b/w and color, because of the price. I don't like color remakes of classics and have never owned one before, but I watched the color version first. It was done very well and added much to the picture.  The reason I didn't give this review a \"5\" is because the audio was a little off. At times, it was tinny and sounded like they were speaking in a tunnel, but it got better as the movie progressed. Max Fleisher's cartoon \"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer\" (1944?) is also included and while wonderful and nostalgic, the audio was dreadful and mismatched to the characters speech. I still enjoyed it.I have the VHS of both the 1970 and 1951 versions, although nothing to play it on! If you receive this DVD and it's defective, I would return it. The copy I have is well worth watching.\n",
      "I have loved this movie forever (A. Sim as Scrooge), and watch it every Christmas season on a special night.  I had a VHS copy for years, but my vcr finally \"died\" so I needed a DVD.I did not watch the Leonard Maltin intro--not because don't like him, I do.  But I didn't want the modern world intruding on my experience.Was also glad this version is in black and white----color would be a travesty for this film.\n",
      "I was very happy with the purchase.  The Black and White DVD is the best no one can put a price on such a classic.\n",
      "I got this movie very quickly. I loaned this copy out and as yet to get it back. I have almost every story of this kind, no matter who is the main character. Sims is my favorite Mr. scrooge.\n",
      "We love the movie. It was clear and great. it is our favorite. We are very pleased with it. thanks\n",
      "I received my order very fast, It was in great condition, I watched the movie and the quality was very good.\n",
      "This DVD A Christmas Carol is a timeless classic, and a joy to watch. There is great depth in the characters, legendary acting performances and a story that is timeless for a reason - it's message.This would make a great gift for the Holiday season, and I am sure anyone of any age will get a lot out of it.The DVD holds true to the text throughout. Not one dull moment. It's an inredible story to watch on screen no matter which version you have.\n",
      "This is hands down the best version of A Christmas Carol.  Alistair Sim, was wonderful as Scrooge.  Have watched it many times, never disappoints,the lesson of the true meaning of Christmas told time and again. A must have for every collector.\n",
      "Of all the movies about Scrooge, this is definitely the best. It is different than the other one's. Another five star movie.\n",
      "This was always one of my favorite Christmas movies and I was thrilled when I found the colorized version. You will not be disappointed with this newest version!\n",
      "This movie is by far my absolute all-time favorite of all the versions of \"A Christmas Carol.\" I saw it as a child, and 65 years later it still affects me more than any of the other versions.  It is simply the best.  Christmas is official only when I can sit down and enjoy this classic.\n",
      "True to Dickens original story.  However your editorial review did mistakenly identify Patrick McNee as playing the part of the young Jacob Marley.  Instead he actually played the part of the much younger Tiny Tim.  Tsk! Tsk!\n",
      "This is such a wonderful film.  It's the first one I ever saw, and it's still my favorite.  (Sorry, Patrick Stewart.)  Now I don't have to wait for Christmas to enjoy it!\n",
      "The movie and case were in excellent condition.  Everything exceeded my expectations!  Enjoyed watching the movie my old one was a VHS and I had to replace it.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase.\n",
      "Every Christmas I take time to read \"A Christmas Carol\"; and also watch the movie.  Lately, it's been difficult to find this version on TV.  You can find the George C. Scott version which is excellent and a Disney version too, but they are not the 1951 version with Alistair Sim. Look out for Marley's scream!  See if you can spot the cameraman in the mirror. Enjoy Scrooge's transformation. It's absolutely giddy! Enjoy and God bless us everyone.\n",
      "This is by far the best version of A Christmas Carole out there.  Black and White all the way!\n",
      "I love this 1951 version of the timeless classic A Christmas Carol ! The quality of the DVD is good! It captures the spirit of the story and is my favorite version!\n",
      "THIS IS THE BEST VERSION OF ALL THE MOVIES MADE OF THIS MARVELOUS TALE.THIS MOVIE CANNOT BE BEAT.WATCH THIS WITH THE SOUND SET ON PCM MONO.HERE'S THE THING, THOUGH.THE PCM MONO IS FULL AND RICH AND DOESN'T SEEM AS IF IT'S REALLY MONO, WHILE THE 5.1 SURROUND SOUNDS AS IF IT'S A VERY TINNY SOUNDING MONO. WE (BERTHA ZELDA AND I) THINK THE BD AUTHORS GOT THE LINK LABELS REVERSED.YES??THE VISUALS ARE STUNNING. SIMPLY GREAT SHADOW DETAILS AND BLACK LEVELS. VCI IS TO BE COMMENDED.\n",
      "Due to the circumstances and choices in the life of Ebenezer Scrooge, he has chosen money over mankind. His partner now seven years dead comes back to warn Ebenezer of his afterlife fate if he does not change his ways. To assist in this task are three spirits, Christmas past (his past), Christmas present, and Christmas of things to come. Can or will Ebenezer change his ways? Why should he?There are many versions of this tale floating around out there including study books and animated movies. Of all these versions, a few stand out.Made in the era of black and white, one cannot help but shun any attempt to colorize it. The Alastair Sim version is a product of its day and he does a very good job of portraying Ebenezer Scrooge. He comes across as mean in his speech of \"Are there no work houses?\" and stingy, displayed during his meal, upon hearing that more bread will cost 8 pence extra he says, \"No more bread.\"On Christmas morning he goes overboard with the maniacal laughter. This is probably emphasized to show his change of heart and to allow him to scare the maid. However it does distract from the story. The story is modified a bit but unless you have been reading the book you will not notice this. To tie his childhood memories of his sister to his present day nephew, they play \"Barbra Allen\" in the back ground (nice touch.)All in all this will make a nice addition to you Christmas collection.There are many versions of this tale floating around out there including study books and animated movies. Of all these versions, a few stand out.Well with all the media adaptations, we finally have Blu-ray. From history, I find that a good remaster and a 46\" screen work well enough. However, because I have a Blu-ray player I chose Blu-ray when ever available at any cost. I am not so sure the film is really cleaned up or remastered. However, it is quite sharp black & white. The film is quite sparse of DVD extras. You will find the Commentary by Marcus Hern and George Cole (Young Ebenezer Scrooge) under the setup and not the extras. The DVD starts with a long VCI Entertainment advertisement.\n",
      "My tape finally wore out, so I purchased the Christmas Carol DVD.  The only complaint I have is that it sticks; my complaint about DVDs in general.  I get more control of my tapes!\n",
      "I purchased this gift for my mom for christmas. She is a big fan and loves the movie. I would recommend this product\n",
      "If you love the Scrooge story, this is a must have!  In my opinion, Alistair Sim was the best Scrooge ever!  This collector's edition with all the extras is a treasure.\n",
      "For years we've watched an old VHS tape of A Christmas Carol with Alastair Sim on Christmas Eve.  It is such a pleasure to see the movie in all it's glory and with a special introduction.  Thank you!\n",
      "Great movie. We have been watching this holiday movie ever since we first viewed it on television many years ago. The reason we purchased it was because we wanted to watch it on Christmas eve. Usually, the T.V. networks air it days before.\n",
      "Scrooge is an adaptation of the Dickens classic \"A Christmas Carol\" set in London at the dawn of the Industrial Age.  There have been many attempts at making this story into a movie, but none have succeeded like this version.  Sim breathes life into the character of Ebeneezer Scrooge, the kind of life that made you boo and hiss at all the arch villains of the old silver screen.  Even more impressive is Sim's portrayal of the \"redeemed\" Scrooge, who, after being visited by the Spirits of Christmas, decides to be more giving ang forgiving toward his fellow man.  A movie to lift one's spirits during the holiday season.\n",
      "One of my fondest memories of Christmas is of watching \"A Christmas Carol\" with our family. I could not wait to get this DVD to play several times during the season. With several versions this is a sure bet!\n",
      "If you love \"A Christmas Carol\" you must have this. You have a choice on how to watch it. See it as it originally was made in black and white or watch it colorized. Also you get the bonus of the 1935 \"Scrooge\" version of \"A Christmas Carol,\" with Seymour Hicks. You also have the option of enhanced for wide screen. You just can't beat your choices. Alister Sims is definitely \"Scrooge.\" The Dicken's story is my favorite Christmas tale and here you get quality plus variety.\n",
      "This is the magical and wonderful 1950's version of the story and it is the best.  It is the scariest and the most fun to watch by far. It adhears to the story, but has extra parts too and I like that if they explain something relevent and enrich the characters or plot.  I am only thirty-four but still like this version better than the more modern ones. I do not like Kelsie Grammer's cheesy musical version at all.  I make it a tradition to watch This Alastair Sim verision presented by Patrick McNee(Tiny Tim) on UPN every 5th of December.  However they didn't show the colorized version this year, but the B&W is shown on AMC. I Think that it was originally shown in Cinimascope but is not availible in that aspect ratio on DVD.  This is great for kids and adults alike as with all of the Christmas Carole shows which relate to everyone.\n",
      "By far the best version of a Christmas Carol.  Yes, this is the orignal we Baby Boomers saw as kids in black and white.  I highly recommend it to every family.\n",
      "There must be dozens of versions of this classic Dickens tale in existence, from Michael Caine and the Muppets to a TV version with Marlo Thomas (?) in the Scrooge role, not to mention animated versions starring everyone from Mister Magoo to Mickey Mouse.  (My personal favorite is the TV version starring George C. Scott.)  But this is considered the definitive version, the 1951 British film with Alistair Sim in the title role.  (For some reason, it was originally released as \"Scrooge\" but has come to be known, at least here in the States, under the original story's title, \"A Christmas Carol\").  And indeed, it seems that Sim's portrayal as the redeemed miser is the standard against which all subsequent performances have been measured.  It is still considered the most \"authentic\" version of the story on film, even though, like most other versions, it still takes some liberties with the story (like changing Scrooge's fiancee's name from Belle to Alice, for some reason).  The cast may be largely unfamiliar to U.S. audiences, except perhaps for the wonderful Hermoine Badderley (Mrs. Cratchit), and Patrick Macnee (John Steed of \"The Avengers\") in a small role.  But as one would expect from a British production, the performances are uniformly fine.  It's still an inspiring movie, and essential for anyone who wants classic holiday films on DVD.This two-disc package contains the usual extras (a rather dry commentary track, bios of the stars, etc.). There is also a colorized version of the film (for those of you who prefer that god-awfully fake process to the original black-and-white) introduced by cast member Macnee, and an earlier 1935 film version starring Sir Seymour Hicks (which isn't bad, but makes you appreciate the Sim version all the more).  Also included is an interview with George Cole, who played young nephew Fred in the 1951 version (and still looks rather dapper today), and a short piece demonstrating the restoration of the film.\n",
      "Alistair Sims was the best ever in the roll.  As a kid, our local TV station played it every year as the late movie (before Letterman and Leno... even Carson existed)on Christmas Eve.  I was scared to death when Marley showed up!  Now I laugh at Scrooge's reactions to the spirits.  Blue Ray version is awesome.Got some childhood memories back!  Get yours now with the best version and watch it at midnight... in the dark... with your family!  \"Scrooge...\"\n",
      "My husband had been looking for the 1951 version of this classic film for a long time on DVD and was so happy to receive it for Christmas!!  Having both versions (Color & B/W) is a great bonus!\n",
      "No one produces Dickens works like the British. Alastair Sim is the best Scrooge. He is kind of terrifying in the first part, is very convincing in his character change and his final transformation is very touching. First rate.\n",
      "I love \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" but \"A Christmas Carol\" gets my vote as the greatest Christmas movie of all--and this version is the best. Enjoy the original black and white version--it has a timeless quality that color does not.\n",
      "This has always been my favorite Christmas movie, and since it was no longer shown on TV during the holidays, I had to own it.\n",
      "our family has a tradition of watching this version of \" A Christmas Carol\" every Christmas eve. Our VHS tape got so old an decreped that we were thrilled to find it on DVD. WE were very unhappy to see that the new one we purchased the year before hand cracked in handling so we needed to quickly replace it. We were able to see the B/W version as well as the color one. What a treat! Our \"tradion\" remains intact with choices to spare. We have watched the other versions of this movie and for our family Alastair Sim does the best \"Ba Humbug\" out there.\n",
      "I am commenting not on the media format but on the film itself. I did not see this version first but it quickly moved to the top of the list. As so many other reviews have said so well, Sim is masterful. My reason for adding comments is to point out what a superb job Noel Langley did with the screenplay. MANY scenes are NOT from the book, yet unlike other screenplays taking immense liberties with a source, it WORKS. Mr. Jorking, the Christmas Day encounter with Mrs. Dilber, the last interview with Marley before he dies, the confrontation at the start between Scrooge and the debtor... all creations! More Dickens than Dickens! These people really understood Dickens' heart and his vision for the story!\n",
      "VCI Home is releasing a brand new DVD of the 1951 classic \"A Christmas Carol\", a remake of the 1938 film.  Ebenezer Scrooge learns the true meaning of Christmas and reforms after being visited on Christmas Eve by four Ghosts.  Scrooge is a cruel miser.  The spirits show him how his behavior has degenerated over the years, and how his heart has grown cold. The apparitions try to melt his steely soul; they help him learn the true meaning of Christmas. Alastair Sim's performance alone makes this a great movie. Really none can compare with Sim's portrayal of Scrooge. The lusty joy he displays after his \"rebirth\" is a marvel to behold. The solitary character of Ebeneezer Scrooge is carefully drawn here. It's a crystal-clear portrait of his lonely, selfish life. He comes home, shelters himself from the winter cold, locks himself away in his home, and counts his money. He attends only to his pitiable self. Sims, as Scrooge, time-travels back to his own past: witnessing how he lost young Alice, his sweetheart. The gentle creature Alice decides not to marry Scrooge, for she learns money means more to him than her. Scrooge can barely watch as the event from his past is re-lived. It is heartrending. She tells him: \"There's more in life than money\". \"A Christmas Carol\"s supporting cast is superb. Hermione Baddeley plays Mrs. Cratchit. The British actress enjoyed a lengthy career in American movies and television, and at Disney Studios.  She was remarkable in 1964's \"Mary Poppins\". Veteran Ernest Thesiger plays the undertaker. Although he made sixty films in a fifty year career, he will always be remembered for his plumb role in the 1935 \"Bride of Frankenstein\".  Rotund Peter Bull has a small part as a businessman. He appeared in, among others, the 1964 classic \"Dr. Strangelove\". \"A Christmas Carol\" was produced by Renown Pictures, a generally low-budget studio that released the old English Mother Riley comedies. They are infamous for \"Mother Riley Meets the Vampire(1952)\" starring Bela Lugosi.  Strange for Christmas, Dickens' book is really a ghost story. Spooking lighting and nimble camerawork provide a few shudders, even today. When Marley's ghost throws open the window to reveal a strange world of suffering specters to Scrooge's eyes, a truly haunting effect is achieved. The two-disc set has many extras, including the original black-and-white version,  a colorized version, a bonus movie(\"Scrooge\" from 1935), audio commentary by Marcus Hearn, and three featurettes:  \"Spirit of Christmas Past\", with actor Gearge Cole, \"Richard Gordon Remembers Renown Pictures\", and \"Charles Dickens, His Life and Times\". You also get two trailers, before-and-after Restoration Comparison, cast bios, and a photo gallery.  This DVD, released by VCI as a \"special deluxe edition\", actually replaces a few earlier versions of \"A Christmas Carol\". Previously, the movie was sold as a double-sided disc, color on one, black-and-white on the other. Then VCI released a new version, with each color and black-and-white version on their own discs, sold seperately. This new transfer is the result of different original 35 MM artifacts. The quality is good. Blacks are solid, but white levels seem too dark. The sound is thin, but the dialogue is OK. Not bad for a 50-year-old public domain film. The 1951 \"Christmas Carol\" is surely a classic for all-time. Dickens' message is clear. So true in the 19th century, and so very true today. \"There's more in life than money\".\n",
      "I don't think there's any question as to whether this movie deserves a high star rating. After all, this is THE classic rendition of A Christmas Carol, featuring Alastair Sim as the definitive Scrooge. A perennially aired film in the holiday season, the only question is: Is it worth owning? While one can only answer that for oneself, I can say this: If your answer is yes, this is the edition worth owning.A great dvd package begins with a great movie, then ads special features worth viewing, and then tops it off with smart packaging. This \"ultimate collector's edition\" does all three perfectly. First of all, this is a two-disc set, giving the viewer the option to view the film in any of a number of forms: restored 4x3, restored 16x9 for widescreen viewing, the colorized version, or the 1935 version of the tale (\"Scrooge,\" starring Sir Seymour Hicks). The special features include commentary, a featurette on Dickens, and a before and after restoration comparison, to name a few.The packaging is expertly done, as well, with a nice plastic case within a cardboard slip-cover, so you know the discs are well protected (unlike some multi-disc packages that feature overlapping disc-holders, which drive me batty).The picture looks fantastic, and the sound is crisp and clear. The one thing I would fault this dvd for is the look of the subtitles. Perhaps it was only due to my dvd player, but, when testing them out, they were a strange red that came out fuzzy and hard to read (like when a television is getting bad reception), even given the black-and-white background. Overall, though, this is an outstanding restoration and repackaging of the classic film.\n",
      "The best of the Christmas Carol movies, though perhaps not as true in details in Dickens' original story. Alistair Sim is simply magnificent. I've watched this dozens of times and not always around Christmas!\n",
      "I had been searching for this particular one for a long time. I remember watching this years ago and it would come on late and go off just at midnight. I wish it would go back to that. but since i have my own i can make it a family tradition\n",
      "No doubt I am heavily influenced having watched this version of the timeless story growing up in the 1960's, but I do think that Sim does an outstanding acting job, as do the other actors.  It is one holiday movie which I don't mind viewing in B/W even though I know there is now the colorized version... for some reason the dark grey tones suit the story.  I highly recommed this movie!\n",
      "This British version is by far the best on Film of A Christmas Carol.  This telling shows you covincingly how Scrooge got to be Scrooge and why it took 3 Spirits plus his old partner Jacob Marley to make their Ghostly Visitations. Besides showing how the World made Scrooge he wonderfully shows you how his Clerk Bob Cratchit dealt with it. Mr. Dickens also teaches a Lesson on how terrible conditions were for the poor but tells us how Christmas is the best Season ever,the Season of Hope.\n",
      "While many have tried, no-one has captured the essence of Dickens so fully as in this early 50's version that to many defines once-and-for-all the characters of A Christmas Carol, and Sim's Scrooge is the centerpiece -- a man utterly without a heart, whose transformation by the spirits of Christmas is so believeable, so transparent as to be the standard by which all subsequent Scrooges must be judged.  True to Dickens while flexible for the sake of film-making with a mythically pastoral England and a very good supporting cast, including The Best Marley's Ghost (my opinion) and a wonderfully entertaining Mrs. Dilber, the housekeeper, this one is the very best film version available and with the improved sound and brighter images in this anniversary edition, this is the one to have -- unless you insist on the over-the-top visuals of the \"colorized\" edition.\n",
      "When I think of my childhood memories of the Christmas holidays one of the first things that come to mind is Alastair Sim and \"A Christmas Carol.\" It was a family ritual and as rituals go, it wasn't really Christmas until the family gathered around the television to watch it. It was a terrifying experience for me back then. The sound of those ponderous chains clanking on the wooden staircase as the ghost of Jacob Marley headed towards the upstairs bedroom of Ebenezer Scrooge would send me running from the room. I don't think any film ever frightened me as much as this one did.What could be more disturbing than the ghostly apparition of poor, desolute Jacob bound for eternity, his punishment for the life he so selfishly wasted while among the living. Having learned the truth too late to save himself, he must now wander the world forever unable to intervene for good in the affairs of men.Ebenezers' only hope of reclaiming his humanity and saving himself from a similiar fate is to encounter three more spirits. Traveling into the past, present and future with his disembodied hosts he comes to understand how the choices he has made and will continue to make in life affects not only his destiny but the destiny of those around him.Ultimately Ebenezer returns a 'Man of Wisdom' and like a holy man in estatic trance rejoices in the received knowledge dancing about and singing, \"I don't know anything, I never did know anything. But know I know I don't know anything!\"Make no mistake, the '51 Alastair Sim production is the definitive version of \"A Christmas Carol\" so don't let anyone tell you otherwise. This is a film for the AGES and definitely one of my All-Time Top Ten!\n",
      "I didnt need to read 600 reviews to know I would like this movie, as Ive watched it many times all of my life. But I was interested in what I would get if I ordered this particular Blu-Ray DVD release, which did not seem to be posted in any of the other recent reviews. Ive had [standard-def] a combo B&W/Colorized version that Ive watched every year for several years. But since it was somewhat grainy I thought the Blu-Ray seemed like a good idea. When I finally got it from Marketplace I watched it last night. Tho there are several pictures on the front and back of the dust-jacket of color scenes, the Blu-Ray is 'not' colorized as Id assumed it would be. Also the Blu-Ray is in 4:3 ratio, not widescreen; tho the Bonus disc (2-disc version) has wide-screen B&W standard-definition (pretty much the same as the old one Ive had for years). Tho there is some mention in the Extras of the 60th Anniversary edition, the dust-jacket says nothing about that, but the Extras described on the one on Amazon that 'does' say 60th Anniv seem to be the same ones on the one I received. There are a few worthwhile Extras about the history of the movie,this is about all Ive gained in this purchase. I know nothing about the technical aspects of making the video, but it seems if they can show it in wide-screen in Standard Definition, they could also show it in wide-screen in High Definition.\n",
      "I only discovered this movie about four years ago but have watched it every Christmas since. To me it's the best version of the Christmas Carol ever made, and now it gets the best treatment you could have ever hoped for. This two disc collector's edition contains two different versions of this movie. First is the colorized version, but then the second is the real treat. They went back to the original prints of this and worked from there. After carefully removing the skips, scratches, and jerky frames, they digitally restored the movie to a version that looks as if it were made yesterday! The sound has been changed to 5.1 digital surround, and there's even a widescreen version for 16:9 televisions.The special features include an earlier version of Christmas Carol (not as good as this one), as well as several featurettes on the movie, interviews with the stars, a feature on Alistair Sim, and others.You can tell the distributor put a lot of effort into this restoration and it shows. I wish they'd do the same for other great films like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"The Bishop's Wife\".Highly recommended as the best version of this classic you'll find anywhere.\n",
      "Charles Dickens' timeless tale of Ebenezer Scrooge and his redemption on Christmas Eve has been endlessly adapted but never more effectively than in this 1951 production in which the great Alastair Sim lays claim to the miserly Scrooge as decisively as Boris Karloff did the role of the Frankenstein monster. Aside from Sim, what makes this version so special is director Brian Desmond Hurst's ability to convey both the grim aspects of the tale as well as the joy. Until the climax, this is, after all, a dark tale of one man's journey from bitterness and greed to a truimphant rebirth as a man of love and compassion.Perfectly cast, with Mervyn Johns splendid as Bob Cratchit and Ernest Thesiger (Dr. Pretorious of \"Bride of Frankenstein\") delightfully morbid as an undertaker as cadaverous as his clients, no other version succeeds as well as this one. And in black-and-white, it's as glorious as the first snowfall of winter.\n",
      "Alastair Sim's \"A Christmas Carol\" is by far the greatest version of the movie. The actors are great and the age of the movie really gets you ready for Christmas, it's warm & cozy. Personally, I like the black & white better but it's nice to have both. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Every Christmas I dig out my Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol in all three movie remakes of the story.  This one with Alastair Sim is an essential part of my collection, and I enjoy watching it very much.\n",
      "Excellent transaction. A Christmas Carol arrived very promptly. I have viewed the B&W disc thus far and it was liked very much. Highly recommended! Great communications. A+++++\n",
      "My wife and I love this verson of Christmas Carol, the others are ok, but we think this is the best.  We watch it at least once every December.  We had it on tape and it finally wore out and I found this version on disc on Amazon and bought it so we can enjoy it for many more years.\n",
      "In December 1845 Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol was first published. Many consider it the best short story (70 pages) ever written. There have been more film versions of A Christmas Carol than any other story, the latest has Micheal Moore as Scrooge. This version in B&W; is by far the best. Other reviews praise the style and narrative of this version, and miss the fact that this is the story word for word as Dickens wrote it. Dickens like Shakespeare is best in his own words. Alastair Sim heads a great cast, Even death is the best one ever done. I have watched this movie on TV, DVD, and VCR, every Christmas Eve since the late 50's when it first came out on TV. (except the two Christmases I spent in Viet Nam) It's as much a part of my Christmas as a Christmas tree, and the best story of redemption ever written.The only suggestion I have to improve the movie is read the story then watch the movie.\n",
      "This is my favorite version of \"A Christmas Carol\" but get the tissue,the future without Tiny Tim will make you cry. You will watch this every year!\n",
      "We believe, the best rendition of this classic tale.  Nice to have on DVD when the family is together since our cable doesn't have this movie often, if ever.\n",
      "good show for the family. Hopefully, might re-instill family values.  All actors good and pulled you into the movie.  Would be good for children\n",
      "This is a great, old-time, black and white classic!  Although it is an older movie, the quality of the film itself is good.  For those who are Charles Dickens \"Christmas Carol\" enthusiasts, this is one of the versions to have to add to your collection!  I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "This is one of the best versions of Scrooge out there.  A must have for any collection.  Allastair Sim is perfect in the role.\n",
      "I know this version of Scrooge is considered by most to be the best, so why should I write a review?  Because I can't help it---it really is THE BEST!!  One reviewer said Sim's acting was \"over-the-top\" and so \"hammy\" that it made him \"squirm.\"  I know we are all entitled to our opinions, but I can't let that comment pass without saying this:  Most versions, such as Patrick Stewart's, leave me thinking as I watch. \"this is only a movie.\"  But Alastair Sim's \"over-the-top\" acting makes me feel that I am actually peeking in on the real life of a man in 19th century England.  A man who has truly been given the opportunity to see himself as he is, and who after being shown this, although reluctantly, still allows the experience to gender true repentance within him.  And the absolute JOY that comes with his heartfelt repentance is tangible to the viewer!  Perhaps that's why that one reviewer felt like squirming.  This is the giddy happiness that one would truly feel upon being given that \"new lease on life\" that true repentance brings.  Sim captures it so BELIEVABLY that you can easily forget it's a movie.  From the moment his maid asks him if he's himself today and he answers distractedly, \"I don't think so.  I hope not!\" to the moment he feels that he must stand on his head, to the moment he laughs at Mrs. Dilber's, \"to keep me mouth shut?\", to the moment he decides to send a huge turkey to the Cratchitt's and scurries around giddily looking for a label, \"Label, label, label, label,\" Sim's performance is a masterpiece of REALITY!!  I admit his acting IS \"over-the-top\"---in believability!  Although the whole movie is well done and the supporting actors are superb as well, still the whole movie takes us to the jewel of all scenes---Christmas morning.  I've seen 9 or 10 versions---and this one is NOT over-rated!  However, almost any movie may seem so if a person is expecting too much.  Lots of hype does damage to the way in which we see something, if we are expecting TOO MUCH from it.  But even having said that, I still say---the 1951 Scrooge with Alastair Sim is the best SCROOGE out there and ONE of the best FILMS of all time!\n",
      "This is the absolute best version of A Christmas Carol over all of them.  Alistair Sim in the role of Scrooge far surpasses any of his successors.  A truly superb Christmas movie not to be missed.  I make this movie a Christma Eve tradition in my household.\n",
      "This is simply the greatest rendition of A CHRISTMAS CAROL that has ever  been filmed.  The cast is first rate, the acting sublime.  Everyone must have this is their collection.\n",
      "The best \"Scrooge\" ever! Be taken back in time to when Christmas was more personal. Alastair Sim plays the lonley and shrewd \"Scrooge\" like none before & none after him. This \"classic\" Christmas movie needs to be part of your holiday DVD collection along with your \"Charlie Brown\" & \"Rudolph\" DVD's. Watch this DVD & learn one of the great values of the holiday season!\n",
      "really a great dvd of the original movie with alastair sim in both black and white and color with special effects.\n",
      "This is the first version of A Christmas Carol I ever saw at the age of 8 years.  I have watched it every year since then and I am now 69 years of age.  I believe the story has as much relevance today as it did when Charles Dickens wrote it in 1843.\n",
      "This movie, and this edition especially, touches my husband's heart each & every time he sees it.  He got this copy for hisbrother, so they could share the memories of watching it as younger children.\n",
      "alistair sim  is TERRIFIC.  worth watching if only to see him. i also appreciated that it reflected the theology of the our time. grace then works righteousness, americans probably appreciate works righte0uness as we are inculcated with the myth of saving ourselves. the individual is all important. pull yourself up by your bootstraps, tough luck if you have no boots. i rate the movie 5 stars\n",
      "This is the best version ever due to Alastair Sim's amazing performance as Ebenezer Scrooge and a wonderful all-star cast.\n",
      "This is my favorite Christmas movie of all time, and this version(starring Alastair Sim)  is very hard to find; the price was also quite reasonable.\n",
      "I've loved this film for every and always had to resort to borrowing my sisters as I was unable to buy it. Thanks to Amazon I now own my own copy. Yes, I've already watched it.Thank you every one involvedCAth\n",
      "If you love Christmas movies, this one has to be in your collection.  We watch this movie every year. I was so happy to get it on DVD.\n",
      "This is the 1951 British movie of the Christmas Carol. It has been re-mastered from the orginal and WOW it is so clear. The last time a saw this movie was on TV and it was so grainy and difficult to hear one was great. It has all the old charm but with today's quality of film. In this package you get to orginal B&W; and a color version.My whole family (9 year old, 6 year old, my husband and I) all watched the movie. This was first time for my daughter and she was so happy with the ending - seeing it for the first time.A great addition to your Christmas Collection - Enjoy!\n",
      "\" a Christmas Carol\" December 12, 2003The Alastair Sim version of Christmas Carol isthe most perfect of the all the movie versions.In black and white, brooding, with sparse sets and musicnot distracting,grim detail, the ghost story that Dickens conveyed of a cold, bleak England and one man who lived there.Jacob Marley hoping to help Scroogeunderstand the cruelty of his ways and not suffering the samefate! The souls throwing money to trying to repent from whatthey did not do in life, made me cry.(Note: see Patrick MacNee as the young Marley)The ghosts are not gentle inshowing Scrooge the errors of his ways.The ghost of Christmas presenttelling Scrooge that 'want(the girl) and ignorance(the boy) cling to him at this time of year.\"Beware of bothbut most of all beware the boy!\"Most insightful and true to this very day.The changes in Scrooge after his ghostly visits are not phoney.He is elated, sorrowful, and humbled by his experience.A wonderful movie to be shown anytime of the year.It's just a very special movie for all the family.\n",
      "This is one of the BEST of this movie.  Reginald Owen and the Tiny Tim guy are perfect.  Much more realistic to me than Alistair Sim as Scrooge.  Color great and sound also.  All fine.  Rates 5 stars in my book and I would recommend to anyone.  GREAT movie for Christmas especially.  No glitches even tho is an old movie.Cecy Ivie\n",
      "I love this version of the Scrooge story. The camera work and acting are a little dated, but that just adds to the sense of nostalgia. Alastair Sim is the best Scrooge of an actor I've seen - and I've see all the versions from Patrick Stewart to Kermit!\n",
      "I love almost every version of Dicken's Christmas Carol, even the Mr. Magoo one has it's own magic, but none will ever beat the Alistair Sim version.  Black & White !  No colorized please.\n",
      "The best version of this classic story. It seems beyond doubt that the English productions of Dickens' stories (and Victorian stories in general) are superior to any other. This production is almost completely faithful to the original story, and really captures the characters and period. It is not 20th century characters dressed in Victorian costume. This is the one to get!\n",
      "The Disc Itself:VCI Entertainment has a reputation as a cut-rate house, dealing primarily in public domain works, which made me wonder about picking up a blu-ray from them. I was pleasantly surprised -- the film is crystal clear, rock steady, and if there are any splices they weren't where I noticed them. This film has been beautifully restored and upgraded in image quality, and I hope we get to see more blu-rays of these classic films with this much attention paid to the transfer.The Movie:One of the best-known, definitely one of the most influential, and considered to be the best adaptation of A Christmas Carol ever committed to film. Alastair Sim's interpretation of Scrooge is lower-key and more realistic than a lot of the cinematic Scrooges have been, and this adaptation dares to touch on elements of the book that are usually skipped over. Also of particular note, where most modern adaptations focus on the Cratchit family's place in Scrooge's life, this adaptation treats them as a part of the whole. Where other adaptations spend almost the entirety of Christmas Present dwelling on Tiny Tim, this movie spends more time on Scrooge's past and on the present of other people around him. Finally, the Christmas Future segment is far ahead of its time. Anybody interested in the genres of horror and/or weird fiction would do well to study this segment and the chilling atmosphere it creates with little in the way of modern special effects.\n",
      "Wonderful, wonderful film.  No one did Scooge like Alastair Sim.  This is a must-have film to watch during the Christmas season.\n",
      "I just love this great movie I watch it every holiday in December and sometimes whenever I want to watch something inspiring\n",
      "This movie is reconditioned well and the sound is good.  This is one of three versions that I collected of this story.\n",
      "Alastair Sim IS the definitive scrooge,and this film IS the definitive version of A Christas Carol\"Written as a morality tale,the Scrooge that Charles Dickens created was indeed a miser,but a conflicted personality,a victim as much as an often abusive victimizer..And as such he was the perfect candidate for redemption,which,in the end,gave the tale such weight..Alastair Sim portrays Scrooge in just this way,a man motivated as much by his past as he is by his present..And despite his flaws the scrooge that Sim creates has our sympathy as well...Given the circumstances his scrooge could be any one of us,his mistakes ours,his salvation our own.Many other actors have attempted the role of Scrooge since Sim,and none of them have succeeded nearly as well..Of the lot only George C.Scott has come close and yet even in this production Scott never really becomes Scrooge but remains Scott playacting...Patrick Stewart's scrooge while interesting somehow does not engage us on quite the same level as Scott,let alone get close to the power that Sim brings to the role.And then there are the gimmick Scrooges..Albert Finney singing and dancing,Jim Carrey being,well,Jim Carrey,even Kelsey Grammer trying hard and yet failing miserably.Alastair Sim's redemptionat the end of this film cannot help both bringing a tear to the eye and a sense of joy to the heart\n",
      "It is not Christmas till I have seen this wonderful movie.  This movie sets a standard that none of the later movies comes close to achieving.\n",
      "This version of A Christmas Carol is the best all around film.  The story and the cast are second to none and is a truly enjoyable Christmas Classic for any age.\n",
      "This one of the best of all the Christmas Caol movie's. One of the oldest no shure but I think so.It is well acted.I like it in back and white it just makes it look more real. Like in the olded days.\n",
      "Just a quick note about this new Blu-ray release of \"A Christmas Carol\".  There are a couple reviews here (especially the one from Peter Prainito) that express disappointment over flaws in the picture.  Admittedly there are a few small glitches -- some apparent missing frames that make tiny jumps (my wife didn't notice them) and a very brief, odd waver in the background in one scene.HOWEVER, lets have a little perspective.  The picture quality is remarkable -- very sharp with good contrast and deep blacks -- and it's such a VAST improvement over the DVD versions that those small issues are easy to forgive.  Remember, this film is in the public domain (meaning anyone can legally sell whatever terrible copy they have) and that this is not a release from a major studio -- VCI is a small company that specializes in public domain movies on DVD.In short, A Christmas Carol has NEVER looked this good, and this is one of the best upgrades from  DVD to Blu-ray that I've seen.  (BTW, the picture is much better than the sound.  There's no upgrade at all over the DVD audio. It's acceptable, but nothing special)If you're a fan of this movie, don't worry about the nit-picking reviews -- it's not flawless, but this is easily the best copy of this film that has ever been released.  Merry Christmas!\n",
      "I love this version of A Christmas Carol with Alistair Sim. It's the best one, in my opinion. All others pale in comparison. I like the black and white version the best, and it's too bad they don't play it at Christmas anymore. At least I haven't seen it.I have the dvd with Patrick Macnee giving a commentary at the beginning and end. It's from 1988. There's the fire place and the Christmas tree in the background, and it's just so great to watch him talking about the film. It just really makes Christmas a little more special.\n",
      "This film has been released I don't know how many times now.  But I'm pretty sure this is the 2nd Blu-Ray version.  I think they did a good job with the video transfer portion.  But I still can't believe that they can't fix the atrocious \"echo audio\" that plagues much of this movie!  And even though I know this makes the purists cringe.  Please put the colourised version back on!!!!  For those who hate it so much.  It's not like you have to watch it.  Just pretend it's not there and let those us who like it enjoy it.\n",
      "Just love this movie.  I have all of them.  But I think this one is the best of the lot.\n",
      "This is a must for the Christmas season.  I my own opinion, this is the best version of this film.  Alastair Sim gives a wonderful performance as Scrooge.  Tho black and white, it is a classic and you will not be sorry to add this to your holiday collection.\n",
      "The Alistair Sim version of A Christmas Carol is my favorite Christmas movie. I replaced my worn out VCR tape with the DVD & couldn't be happier with the quality.\n",
      "I have been searching for different versions of this delightful story; this one is so far the best that I have found, at least for me.\n",
      "I studied Christmas Carol in school and to see it in a movie was excellent. The story was retold with accuracy but the acting seemed to me a bit too dramatised, maybe it was the norm in b/w days, and our eyes have got used to sleek and evolved acting forms.\n",
      "...Alastair Sim's performance in Dickens' holiday classic results in THE definitive filming of the story, breathing life into the familiar plot while earnestly hewing to the author's vision.On Christmas Eve, miserly, callous Scrooge is visited by the ghost of his former partner and by a series of other supernatural agents, who try to bring him to a realization of his own mortality and the emptiness of his cramped existence. The heavy-handed political subtext--poverty and ignorance are the evils that Scrooge nurses through his reliance on the \"sufficiency\" of workhouses and orphanages to care for the poor--is handled with skill, and even in its most obviously manipulative moments is true to Dickens' intentions. But Sim's amazing embodiment of the character is outstanding, coursing through the range of human experience toward a giddy, heartfelt redemption that is truly earned. The result is a fable that is as irresistible as it is corny, as compelling as it is predetermined; in short, a classic.The script is almost entirely taken verbatim from the original text; Hurst's otherwise unexceptional direction succeeds largely by peopling the film with superb British character actors (e.g. Bull, Hordern, Baddeley, Marsh, Patrick Macnee as the young Marley, and Elsa Lanchester in an uncredited cameo) and letting them have fun with Dickens' prose. Most versions of the story, particularly a 1984 TV film with George C. Scott, gloss over Scrooge's loss of self-control, without which his redemption becomes impossible. Stick with this one.\n",
      "My family watches this every Christmas eve. It started by accident and now my kids have grown up watching it and appreciate it. I can't recommend this movie too highly.Who knows, it may change you one Christmas eve?\n",
      "I already owned a copy of this video and lent it to someone, the problem was I didn't remember who. So I looked to replace it.When I orderd this video from \"VCI Entertainment\" I Was hoping it would be as good as they advertised.All I can say is I was not only completely satisfied but also surprised and delighted by the amazing job they did in all aspects of this production. From added features to delightful packaging not even mentioning the beautiful job of redigiting this classic movie.A true must for anyone looking for this feature. You won't be disappointedThanx great job....\n",
      "An interesting storey of a man Ebenezer Scrooge who has lost the spirit and meaning of Christmas.He is visited by three ghosts of Christmas. One from his past, one from the present and one from the future. They serve to remind him of the positive and joyouse aspects of the season and what may come for the future if he doesn't change his nasty and selfish ways. Thankfully for Ebenezer he is taught the true meaning of Christmas and embraces his loved ones and town's folk with a large and open heart full of love for every one.\n",
      "This is the best Christmas Carol movie. I've seen a lot of different Christmas Carol movies and nothing compares to this one. We watch this every Christmas.\n",
      "This is the original Christmas Carol movie that scared me every Christmas.  These actors have been copied in the remakes of The Christmas Carol movies that have been remade since this 1951 movie.  Feel i have missed the Christmas spirit by not seeing this version, so purchased it myself!\n",
      "This Black and White version of A Christmas Carol (aka Scrooge) is my personal favorite.  I've watched most and own several versions of this great story but this version stands above the rest for me.  Alastair Sim is an excellent actor and has one of the most entertaining and believable transformations of all the versions I've seen.  This is the one version I watch every year no matter what.  It's become a Christmas Eve tradition over the past 10yrs.\n",
      "I admit I grew up with Alastair Sim as Scrooge - but I've seen many since - including George C. Scott.  And all pale in comparison.  This captures the look, feel and sentiment in England at the time and uplifts our spirits  each and every time we see it.  Please treat yourself and your family to  the most wonderful Christmas movie of all time.\n",
      "I love this version best my husband likes the updated Scrooge we debate this on a regular basis but I love this version best!!\n",
      "Awesome movie.  Absolutely the best of all 10 versions. I must have watched it 10 times this season alone. This is a must have\n",
      "I watch this version every year since i was young and still think it is the best version even if though it is B/W the new ones have to add  junk for 3D effect and mess up the story for not good reason! Best acting too!\n",
      "this is the most classic and compelling version of charles dicken's  \" a christmas carol \"  ever viewed and the fact that it is showed on television so infrequently each year is disheartening.  i was just a child when  I remembering it airing on  \" Million Dollar Movie \" the week before  Christmas and I was glued  to the T.V. every night!  Even my daughter, who was born in 1986 and has seen many  movie versions  has said the alistair simm version  is the best version she has ever seen and it is a family tradition at Christmas to watch  the Alistair Simm version of  \" A Christmas Carol \" before we go to sleep Christmas eve and she intends to make it a tradition with her own daughter! Tell whomever you have to that it is the finest version and it needs to be viewed more often over the holidays! thank you.  cj 72850\n",
      "This I believe is the best version Of a Christmas Carol . Alastair sim was the perfect Scrooge he face is so expressive and being in black & white made it more atmospheric. Loved it have done since a child worth watching.\n",
      "Have seen all of the Scrooge and Christmas Carol movies over the years and this is the best one of all, even in black & white.  The stellar performance by Alastair Sim is acting at its best.  Classic movie lovers shouldn't miss this one.\n",
      "Everyone know that the Christmas season isn't complete without telling the story of Ebeneezer Scrooge and his journey from being the meanest man in London to becoming Christmas's ambassador of good will. Over the years there have been dozens of versions, but no one can come close to Alistair Sim in portraying this \"wrenching, grasping, scheming covetous old sinner\", to quote the author Charles Dickens. Watch him as he shows Scrooge at his most heartless. Watch him as the ghosts of Christmas confuse, annoy, and ultimately terrify him. Then watch him spread joy across the screen and into your heart. A sentimental story portrayed by the best in his craft- a yearly tradition for 50 years!\n",
      "Haven't viewed it yet but this is the Christmas Carol all others are judged by and Alastair Sim is why.\n",
      "As a kid, one of the defining moments of Christmas afternoons was sitting back to watch A Christmas Carol, starring Alastair Sim.  Since then, other versions have come and (thankfully) gone, but Alastair Sim remains as the quintessential Scrooge for all seasons. Whatever you do, maintain the spirit of the film by ordering your copy in the original black and white: the scene with the shadow of the rising window in Scrooge's bedchamber - to cite only one instance - is impossible to render in a colorized version, which, in general, destroys the somber mood necessary to the story. Sim is brilliant. While George C. Scott is good, the level of emotional involvement is not up to Sim's performance.\n",
      "I find it amazing how many people rip on a DVD or Blu-Ray purchase because there \"weren't enough extra scenes\" or some other nit-pick. While a valid area for review, the main point of your review should be about the MOVIE. Particularly old movies which don't have 5 different versions floating around on DVD like all of today's movies, where one might be tempted to compare the \"modern features\" or extras between them.Anyway, this is far and away the best rendition of \"A Christmas Carol\" ever filmed IMHO. While the style and method of acting is not familiar to today's younger generations it is nonetheless extremely compelling and entertaining both in its humor and its more somber themes. Even the special effects, for such an old movie, don't really distract you any from the story. They fit right in mostly. I have never tired of watching this version of a Christmas Carol, and I doubt if I ever will.Beautifully done during an era of film-making that should never be forgotten. Most kids today don't even know what constitutes a \"good movie\". By many parents' standards you'd think if \"it's good enough for them to stare at it uninterrupted for 2 hours\" then it must be \"good enough\". Not so! Movies like this, like North by Northwest, and many other old classics put today's \"movie stories\" to shame. Do them a favor and make them sit through this old BW some time! They might not appreciate it right away but eventually if \"subjected\" to movies from this era enough, they'll start to \"Get it\". :-)\n",
      "Watching this movie was a Christmas Eve tradition in our familyfor many years. There have been many remakes of this film since 1951,but we always considered this to be one of the most faithfulpresentations of the Dickens Classic..\n",
      "Wonderful movie and speaks a great message to mankind.Very happy with product and shipped in 100% condition.A must have for the Holidays or anytime of the year!\n",
      "When I was a kid, I always remember watching the version that I bought, with Alistar Sims. I love this movie. I have it on VCR Tape, but I know they are phasing out, so I looked on Amazon.com and found it there. BONUS: I never saw it in color. The DVD I bought had 2 Disks. One in Black and White and One in Color. Thank you, Amazon.com for more years of enjoyment. Colleen\n",
      "One can see the progress of the popularity of the classic old story as the remakes go through the years.  This one is up in production values and talent from the 30's versions.  I don't know if there were any in between; it doesn't appear so.  Dickens certainly got his point across with this story, and it seems more sharply drawn with each remake. Indeed, this version is the most intense and effective Scrooge to the date of its release. Scrooge didn't set out to become grossly insensitive. He became embittered by one of life's injustices and turned in on himself and everyone else out. Anyone can do that by varying degrees. It was clearer to me with this current viewing that, though Scrooge readily agreed with justice's claims upon himself as he was shown the man he had become, he could not envision being able to be forgiven or to change, though he earnestly desired it.  What a priceless gift to be forgiven when desiring to change, and then with that, finding the ability to change come alive from within.\n",
      "The 1951 British film of Dickens' *A Christmas Carol* is perhaps the only screen retelling of this story that stands outside notions of time or space.  As powerful as we may reckon George C. Scott's performance as Scrooge in a later TV-movie, that film bears the imprint of its own time, as does the musical *Scrooge* with Albert Finney and the apalling musical version starring Kelsey Grammer that was unleashed on us some years ago. The 1951 film does not bear the imprint of either its time or place of origin. It is plainly a British film of a story by an English author, but in its vision and quiet authority it lends weight to the saying that film, like music, is a universal language.I can't recall when I first saw this film.  It was surely on TV, probably when I was an adolescent, but I must have been in high school before I took notice of it as something special. Now I can't imagine the holidays without it.  It isn't Christmas until I have seen this film 3 or 4 times (starting on Thanksgiving evening).This is the film that most intimately and commandingly traces Scrooge's descent from a lonely yet idealistic youth to aging miser. The first scene from his past, a visit to his boyhood school, forecasts his later isolation as we see him seemingly forgotten by his family, doomed to spend the holidays alone until his adored sister comes to fetch him.  The sister even drops a hint that Scrooge's father might have undergone a change of heart similar to that Scrooge himself experiences.There are two minor flaws in this masterful and touching film. One, I confess, always irritates me:  the Cratchit kids are supposed to be Cockneys, but all six of them babble in flawless Oxbridge.  At least central casting didn't insist on straightening Tiny Tim's front teeth.The second flaw involves a charlady who appears for the only time in the film's most powerful scene: Scrooge's housekeeper, an undertaker and the charlady meet at a junkman's shop to sell items purloined from the home of an unnamed man who has just died.  (The viewer knows the dead man is Scrooge, who watches the ghoulish display with the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come, but is unaware that these are reactions to his own death.) The housekeeper and undertaker appear earlier--the housekeeper comes to Scrooge's office to tell him Marley is dying, and when Scrooge visits Marley's deathbed, housekeeper and undertaker wait at the head of the stairs. Their appearance in the junkshop scene symmetrically echoes their presence at Marley's deathbed--but we have not seen the charlady before, and I have long suspected that an earlier scene involving her must still be someplace on the cutting room floor.Unsurpassed in its penetrating views of human nature, pain, love and joy, this film deserves a place in everyone's collection and a role in everyone's holiday enjoyment. It has to be kept in mind that this film was made in 1951, and even transfer to DVD format cannot overcome some of the FX scars that still existed at that time.  The most obvious is the arrival of young Scrooge's sister in his schoolroom; as she rushes toward her brother, she runs right through the phantom of the older Scrooge, and the traces of double-filming are evident to an extent that would never pass today.  The same kind of problems plague sequences in which Scrooge is seen supposedly flying through the air with the spirits of Christmas Past and Christmas Present.But such problems pale beside the eloquence, for example, of Tiny Tim's vigil at a toy store window while Mrs Cratchit buys the family's Christmas goose.  Delighted by the display of playthings, he is drawn first to the mechanical image of a laughing clown, and then to a model steamship.  As the model ship is taken from the window and sold, Tim is downcast. The shot cuts back to the laughing clown, whose grimace and merriment now seem to mock the child.  Not a word is spoken, but the scene encapsulates as fully as ten minutes' worth of dialogue the message Charles Dickens spent most of his life trying to convey to his contemporaries.\n",
      "I have seen many different versions of this though not all, but this is still my favorite.I usually dont take to old movies but this is the only version I will watch of this beloved classic.The acting is superb. I can watch this over and over again.Alister Sim IS Mr. Scrooge and his emotions evoke such a tug at your heart.You havent seen A Christmas Carol until you have seen this version.Cant wait to get my copy of this.\n",
      "Very briefly...Finally, an edition of the 1951 British version of A Christmas Carol that is TRULY and FULLY restored and re-mastered from the original 35mm film.  This version of the film is absolutely beautiful, amazingly clean and crisp (as opposed to the other issues of this film).  It is very pleasing that this movie finally has gotten the treatment that it been so deserving of over the past many years.  Not only that, the extras are absolutely wonderful and easily worth the purchasing this particular edition.ENJOY!!!\n",
      "The movie came fast, although the case was broken.I got 4 different types of the movie. Awesome !My fav movie.\n",
      "This movie closely follows Charles Dickens' novel.  Alistair Sims' portrayal of Scrooge is spot on.  I watch this every year and never tire of it.\n",
      "Love the movie. shipping was fast.\n",
      "This is the version that I grew up with.  I love this old black and white film with all the great shading and sound effects.  I'm not going to review this film.  That's beem done hundreds of times.  I want to point out something that I noticed in the special features:  there is a feature that can be turned on to provide narration for the blind.  This is a feature that should be automatically included in all discs.  Oh yes, look for Patrick Macnee (John Steed of the Avengers); he plays the young Jacob Marley.\n",
      "This is without a doubt, the best version of the countless remakes of \"A Christmas Carol.\" Alister Sims is spectacular as the old curmudgeon, and delivers a timeless performance. Filmed in wonderful black and white, this movie still outshines all. So warm the eggnog and enjoy!\n",
      "Many \"Christmas Carol\" movies and TV productions have been made through the years.This is by far THE BEST and definitive version. Alistair Sim is Scrooge!!He imparts the crotcheti-ness while still giving us a feeling that he is redeemable. A beautiful and heartwarming Christmas watch for all families.\n",
      "I have to be honest, I don't know the quality of the item because it was a Christmas gift for my father.  However I felt it was still appropriate to state in this review that it made my father very happy and therefore that was good enough for me.  He is not at all picky when it comes to the quality of DVDs and so I don't have to wait until he sees it to write this review.  The look on his face said it all!!\n",
      "The best version ever of the Dickens classic. Alistair Sim does a terrific job. You really feel for the guy. No one else has done better, I vow.\n",
      "Aside from the excellent Jim Backus renditionMr. Magoo's Christmas Carolwhich really clearly carries to chidlrne the tale (and its Christian moral against greedy capitalism which brings us only poverty and eternal punishment in the afterlife for those of us who deny our brothers and sisters and children nourishment and warmth: \"I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat . . .\") without the trauma of ghosts and shape shifting doorknobs (as animated and thus acceptable), this is the best and the only Christmas Carol for adults and children.\"Mankind was my business!\"Several Hollywood attempts have been made and all fail miserably, includingScroogeandScrooged. This is the greatest. Otherwise, gather your children on your lap before the fireplace and read the book together, most favorably atA Christmas Carol (Dover Thrift Editions)although illustrated editions also exist.A secret to share with those who know: while we reviewers believe we will earn extra credit for praising this version highly, the best of all time is hidden here on the second disk: a 1935 B&W; version with a far better Scrooge, an infinitely better Cratchitt (whose poverty demands not wattles but skeletal thinness, long stork legs and deep humanity and heart) and an excellent and superior ghost of Christmas Present. All it lacks are the special effects but so what? It makes up for this with talent. It is also the better adaptation for including the coal bit of business in the office of Scrooge and Marley when we fist meet Cratchitt - this scene defines both Cratchitt and Scrooge and is painfully left out of the version here at hand. And MArley's great and telling line: \"Mankind was my business!\" is followed by \"Charity, forebearance . . .\"I cannot bore you with all of the product details so well enumerated and commentated in so many other reviews and upon this product page (including the correct comment: \"What were the thinking in the eighties!\" regarding the unfortunate, misbegotten yet eminently avoidable colorized version, which I actually do not find as objectionable as some and in fact quite evocative, especially as it was made with a subdued palette and from an unrestored version, and thus the grotesque over acting of Marley's Ghost recalls more the agonized anguished of the damned who must see the evil they have brought without the power to redeem it, and not just carpet chewing by a hammish actor over-emoting, as the restored version appears.)I cannot begin to describe to you how excellent and true this film really is, which works so well on so many levels. This two disk set (quite generous for a film so brief) contains a wealth of EXTRAS which truly fulfill the substance of its advertised status as \"Ultimate Collector's Edition.\"Notice there are three versions given here, with the colorized version with the elderly Patrick McNee's (who plays the young and slender Marley) warm and hospitable introduction on the second disk with the superior if crudely editted 1935 version mentioned above, and the restored 4x3 and the restored 16x9 on the other disk.I am grateful for the Spanish subtitles to share with my Spanish reading friends, and the English subtitles for my own at times hard ears. Subtitles nevertheless are always optional. The audio commentary also is optional, but may be slightly welcome upon a second viewing, and is not necessarily entirely as droning, annoying and arguable as much of these commentaries, including anything by John Carpenter, or the outrageous Cowie Criterion commentary to that greatest film of all time:Grand Illusion - Criterion Collection.I did discover nevertheless the commentary on this collector's edition of Christmas Carol disappointing, as we hear an alleged expert in cine but meek interviewer trying valiantly to drag some memory at all out of the unprepared actor who had played the young Scrooge some fifty years earlier and therefore now hitting eighty years old could not remember very many details at all.But enough of my own babbling on like an unwelcome noisy neighbor in a multiplex movie theatre, liable to receive a bucket of buttered popcorn upon my head. Let's watch this great movie in love and again! And do try the 1935 version, and of course the great Magoo!Mankind IS our business. Our only business.\n",
      "Sister stated that the movie arrived about a week after ordering and while it wasn't the vision that she thought it was she still enjoys having it as it is one of her favorite movies\n",
      "It did not seem like Christmas until I saw this movie.  It hasn't been on tv much in the last few years but I'm glad to have my own copy.\n",
      "I haven't watched it yet because it's too early in the year. I would've given you 5 stars but I'm not sure I will like the colorized version. I fell in love with the original, and it's been years and years since I've seen it. No tv station plays the greats and it's a shame!! I hope I enjoy the color, and I pray there's no scratches on the DVD. I can't wait to watch it with my 2 daughters on Christmas Eve. Thank you kindly.Sincerely,Cindy\n",
      "I've always had to wait and guess if they would show this version on regular television networks so those of us who do not have cable could enjoy it.  Not anymore!  I have my very own personal copy and I am very pleased with the quality of the product.\n",
      "I was nervous that it was not black and white, but it was and I was happy. The quality is good\n",
      "In my opinion this is the best movie version of this classic tale, alastair sim is the standard to go by\n",
      "The movie itself is excellent, my favorite Carol, and a yearly tradition for me. I read the book during early December and then watch this at midnight in the dark on Christmas Eve. Woo! :^) I enjoy some other versions (specifically, Scott, Stewart, and McGoo :), but this one feels the most authentic as you watch it, IMHO. People say it's the 'closest to the book' but in reality it has more scenes that are not in the book than most versions. But those scenes are so well realized, and so true to the \"spirit\" (you'll pardon the expression) of Dickens' original, that they make for the best overall version, IMHO. Not just the best Carol, but one of the best book adaptations of all time, and quite an excellent film in its own right.The quality of the transfer is excellent. It's crisper and clearer, and with a higher contrast than many a version I've seen on TV and video tape. Details pop out. Easily the best I've seen. If this movie is a favorite you should get this version, rather than struggle through the TV or YouTube versions each year.That said, the extras on the DVD are just OK. The commentary with George Cole, who plays the young Scrooge in the movie, is moderately interesting, but not well-prepared and more about Cole, his career, and his relationship with Sim, than the film. Would have liked to have heard more about the movie itself, but as I said, it was moderately interesting. There is an interview with Cole that covers much of the same ground, and is therefore a bit redundant. An audio-only interview with the producer of the film which I did not find so interesting, a photo gallery which is mostly (but not only) stills from the movie, and text bios of the main actors and the director.There are two extra versions of the movie. There is a 16x9 version they made basically by cropping off the top and bottom of the restored version and magnifying what's left. Can't imagine why *anyone* would want to look at that. I saw several scenes where characters were reacting to something that was in the frame, but now is not. Complete waste of time. There is a colorized version. I personally don't care for colorized movies, but I could see why some would *if it was done well* but this is not. It's clearly some old colorized version from the public domain. It is NOT a colorized version of the crisp, restored version of the movie; it's an old, fuzzy print, and colorized badly. If VCI had used its improved version and colorized it well, it would be much more worthwhile (though, again, I personally would still watch the B&W; version).There is a copy of the 1935 version starting Seymour Hicks, a good version I enjoy mind watching, but unfortunately it's a bad print. Again, would not mind seeing VCI take a crack at restoring it, if that's even possible.To sum up, I'm glad I bought this, even at a too-high price of $39.99, but only for the excellent restored, 4x3 version of the Sim film. The rest of it seems to have been added only to boost the price tag. What would have been great is just the restored 4x3 version, with the commentary, interviews, and bios, on one disk, for $19.99. That said, I'm still glad to have the restored film and since I will likely watch it every year for decades, I'm not too bothered by the price I paid.\n",
      "5 stars for the movie 1 star for amazon. Never will I order from this company again. Family video has my business and it's 13.99 for a christmas carol blu ray dvd combo. I have to wait for it at family video but I will not pay more on amazon good day sir\n",
      "Am I naive to think that DVDs come with Subtitles?  If so, then this comment doesn’t count.  However, if that is a reasonable expectation, then I am most disappointed.\n",
      "This 1951 adaptation of A Christmas Carol, starring Alastair Sim as Ebenezer Scrooge, is hailed by many as the best adaptation of Charles Dickens' timeless Christmas story.  Certainly, it is a very good movie more than capable of bringing a tear to your eye as you witness Scrooge's rebirth as a man who vows to keep the Christmas spirit in his heart every day of the year, but I must admit being rather bothered by the way this presentation oftentimes wanders far afield of the original storyline.  The film does tell the story in all of its larger facets in the proper way, but it often takes its own path toward the predetermined destination.  This is noticeable very early on, as some of my favorite lines from the story are paraphrased and expressed in different terms than what I was expecting.  Such a reworking of the dialogue becomes a trademark of this production, but this in and of itself is something of a quibbling matter.  What strikes me as much more serious, however, is the fact that this film presents scenes that do not exist in Dickens' story and to some degree rewrites what actually was written.  All of these innovations, which I see as quite needless, take something away from the full effect of this powerful story upon me.It is interesting to watch the manner in which these filmmakers of mid-century presented the four spirits that visit Scrooge in the early hours of Christmas morning.  Jacob Marley and the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are basically shown as mere reflections of sorts, very lightly translucent beings, and I must say this works fine, especially since this is a film of the heart in which special effects are largely incidental.  I would have liked to see Marley's mouth drop open dramatically once he removed the sling from his head, but there were many little things such as this I looked for in vain in this particular adaptation.  Of much more consequence, though, are the changes and additions to the script one finds here.  As the film progresses, Dickens' story is at times drastically rewritten.  We are shown the death scene of Scrooge's beloved sister, non-Christmas scenes featuring the avaricious young duo of Scrooge and Marley (with the young Marley played by Patrick MacNee of future Avengers fame) making their way up in business, and other scenes Dickens never described directly.  Most galling of all, at least to me, is the view we have of Scrooge's one-time fiancé's life as a mature woman; it could not be more different than the life Dickens describes to us.The looks at Christmases past seem to take undue time here, leaving the visions of present and future Christmas days too little time to achieve their utmost effect.  Even Tiny Tim is in a sense given the short shrift.  The film makes up for its shortcomings to some degree at the end, but even Christmas morning is marred by the insertion of a servant you won't find in Dickens' original story.  Alastair Sim makes a memorable Ebenezer Scrooge, but his performance falls far short of George C. Scott's later portrayal of Scrooge as Dickens envisioned him.  This 1951 version of A Christmas Carol is a notably good retelling of the Christmas classic, but I much prefer adaptations that present the story as it was written.\n",
      "An American classic. Best version of them all....Highly recommendedThis cast is far superior to the other versions made over the years\n",
      "This Christmas Carol collection is, as almost all the other reviewers have attested, about as good as it gets.  I watched all the editions straight through, and while the restored original B/W versions were great----Wow, what a difference a fantastic job of colourisation makes!  The best acting scenes by far are when Sim (as Scrooge) awakens and prances around etc---It brought me back every time to childhood memories of my sister and I watching this movie as tots and dancing around with him. - A perfect charm to arouse the Christmas spirit in any one at any time of year.  Ahem, you know you've been affected when you pop down to your local pub and the barkeep asks you why you are smiling (suspecting I'd won the lottery or something, I shouldn't wonder) and, without thinking, you mawkishly reply, \"Tiny Tim!\"---5 Charmed Stars\n",
      "I consider myself a student of \"A Christmas Carol\" of sorts, having sought down and seen or heard every version I know of.  This tale is the most retold, in part or in whole, of any piece of literature outside of the Bible and Shakespeare.  It has appeared in at least 25 film/animated versions, has been adapted to countless TV shows, and has been referenced even more than that.Alastair Sim's Scrooge is among the very best portrayals, and the film on the whole is the best film version I've seen.  I am reviewing the other versions individually, so I won't rehash them here, but this one is the best and my favorite film version.Give me this one along with Patrick Stewart's solo performance and I'd be a very happy camper.I've even grown fond of the errors in the film, like the stage hand that appears in the mirror reflection on Christmas morning.A tremendous cast and a wonderful atmospheric quality make this film so memorable and re-watchable.\n",
      "This version of \"A Christmas Carol\" hasn't been run on any TV channel that I could find for at least two years, and it was driving me crazy! I had no choice but to purchase a copy of the best rendition of Dicken's beloved story. Alistair Sim's portrayal of Ebenezer Scrooge is the prototype against whom all others must be compared to, and they all fall short of the mark. Sim manages to embody the spirit of the character, not merely play the part. The supporting cast is no less inspired, especially Michael Horndern as Marley's Ghost- he conveys the torment of a tortured soul like no other. If you find yourself trying to describe this wonderful movie to someone who's never seen it because you can't find it airing during the Christmas season, you owe it to yourself to buy it now. You won't be disappointed!\n",
      "I love the Dickens' Christmas Carol. I buy all of them. I love this one because of the black and white. Plus I like to see the actors when the were very young.\n",
      "Having the Alastair Sim version in both color and black and white was great and the bonus of the 1935 movie was special.\n",
      "My opinion is that the 1951 version of \" A Christmas Carol is by far the best one ever made. My sister however disagrees...but that is fine with me.. Alastair Sim does such a wonderful job of bringing the transition from the mean old miserly Scrooge who is  full of dislike for mankind to the \" Can you forgive me  for being a stubborn old fool, for having no eyes to see with, no ears to hear with all these years...!\" I love his transition especially here , with Bob Crachit and even Christmas morn with Mrs Dilber his maid...!\n",
      "Transaction was a pleasant deal and the delivery was as scheduled and as promised, what more could you ask from a computer online purchase, excellent service, thanks. WHY are they just now asking me if I am over 13,,this was made in 38 before ratings even came out and this dang sure isn't a movie to be concerned with,,,LOL.\n",
      "My all time favorite Christmas movie.  I watch it every Christmas eve with a good glass of Scotch, a nice fire and all the magic of Dickens.\n",
      "This is one if not THE best ever version of A Christmas Carol in my opinion.  Alastair Sim does a masterful job of making himself into this role.  The casting was excellent.  There were many small moments as well that made this movie so memorable. The undertaker at the top of the stairs, Scrooge falling onto his grave stone, and his dying sister crying out that he take care of his nephew (Which he missed).  These and other scenes added so much more depth to the story.At the end of the movie, Sim does another incredible job becoming the jovial transformed Scrooge.  It will bring tears to your eyes.I never tire of this version......\n",
      "With so many versions of this film in existence, I thought it would be really nice for the kids to see the version I grew up watching.  For some reason, the performances in this version are more real, more heartfelt than any that have come after.  It turned out to be a hit with the kids, too.  I think the flip side of the disc is in black and white, but we only watched in color, so far. That's about all the modernizing this production needed -- it out ranks successor versions by miles.  Get a copy for your collection -- you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "This classic is indeed timeless and will gladly go on forever!A fervent story of one man's inhumanity to others and to himself, and of his learning the ultimate lesson in compassion and charity.Apart from the Sim's version, there have been other versions starring well-known actors such as Geoge C Scott, Patrick Stewart, Henry Winkler, Reginald Owen, and others.  While the other variations are excellent in their own right (e.g., Reginald Owen's opening scene with his nephew or George C Scott's Ghost of Christmas Present), none compare to the transformation energetically espoused by Sim!  One of the best scenes is happy-go-lucky Sim boyishly chasing his maid to give her a Christmas present!For those who have read the book, the Sim's version is great, especially his time with the Ghost of Christmas Present and all the places they visit, seeing Christmas cheer and happiness across the globe (which is usually not in other versions).B&W; or color - the Sim's version is a keeper for the lovers and collectors of this timeless tale.\n",
      "All though I have seen all of the earlier editions of \"A Christmas Carol\" this was my first. I saw it at a young age and watched it many, many times over the years. I must see it every year along with some of the others. Alastair Sim played the part the way I will always rate all the others in earlier and later versions. I am also lucky to have it in both original black and white and the newer colorized addition.\n",
      "This is my favorite Christmas movie of all time, it is so true to the book. It doesn't feel like Christmas until the first viewing.\n",
      "I grew up in the Theater and my very first role was Tiny Tim.  This 1951 version with Alistair Sim is a classic in every way. For The Avengers fans, Patrick McNee is in the cast as well as introduces the film.  This is the best version in any form. For Every Christmas.\n",
      "Best Christmas movie.  Watched every year since I was a kid.  Reminds me of some of the streets I walked when I lived in the UK.\n",
      "I fail to understand why Amazon continues to lump together reviews from different DVD releases as if they were all the same.  It can be difficult to figure out if a review is referring to the particular DVD or of some prior release.  Often the only help is the date of the review.  In any event I greatly enjoyed the blu ray release.  I did not compare it to an earlier release that I own but I found that the blu ray images were sharp and without a lot of artifact.  I noted, as did others, the occasional skipped frame or jump, but I did not find them bothersome.  I only listened to the monaural sound track so I cannot comment on any benefit from the 5.1 mix.  The monaural track sounded fine.\n",
      "I'm sure we all have favorite versions of the Dicken's story, but there's just something about this black & white film from 1950. An entirely British production lead by one of England's greatest comic actors (here playing an eccentric, but always believable Scrooge).Watch the scene when Scrooge gets out out of bed at the end on Christmas morning. One long take. Now watch it again. Anything odd about the reflection in the mirror?Buy it. Enjoy. Much better than the still recent DVD. Better commentary and extras. Looks better as well.\n",
      "This is my favorite of all Christmas Carol movies and I could never find a DVD that was worth the money. This is, I got it fast and in perfect condition.\n",
      "A Christmas Carol starring Alastair Sim is, in my opinion, the best version of this Charles Dickens tale. He is the perfect Scrooge.  Also the \"Spirits\" are more interesting and the other characters are more endearing in this version.\n",
      "\"Scrooge\" is a movie adaptation of Charles Dickens' 1843 classic story of an old cold-hearted man who repents his callous philosophy on Christmas Day after being visited by four specters.  This version of many is arguably the toughest to succeed: the production and its cast flesh out Dickens' relatively short novel to a moving story about an old miser's spiritual resurrection.  Actor Alastair Sim is the centerpiece as Scrooge and his performance probably still remains on top of most others' portrayals.  His capture of Scrooge's remorse feels authentic and he does a masterful job in expressing the character's joy on Christmas Day.  This 1951 adaptation is interesting in that Scrooge's past is greatly expanded, it lends greater insight into his hard-hearted development as a businessman, and his resentment of the nephew whose birth contributed to the death of his sister.  Another addition is that his housekeeper, Ms. Dilber (Kathleen Harrison), plays a more visible role in the story, which amplifies Scrooge's personality change on Christmas Day.  The best part is Scrooge's reconciliation with his abused clerk, Bob Cratchet (Mervyn Johns), which so far has not been surpassed by later actors attempting to portray this scene.  While this is less loyal to Dickens' writing, it remains very effective in understanding Scrooge.Its comparison with the 1984 production starring George C. Scott and the 1999 version with Patrick Stewart is open to opinion.  The later productions enjoy beautiful movie sets and their portrayals of the specters are excellent.  The 1984 version boasts the scariest Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, and features Edward Woodward as the Ghost of Christmas Present, Anthony Walters who is almost perfect as Tiny Tim, and Nigel Davenport in a cameo as Scrooge's father.  The 1999 version is commendable for being the most loyal to Dickens' original story, and Joel Grey makes an excellent appearance as the Ghost of Christmas Past.  George C. Scott and Patrick Stewart are admirable in their respective roles, and both are excellent in portraying miserable old Scrooges, but they fall short of Sim's portrayal on Christmas Day.Another worthy mention is the 1970 musical version with Albert Finney as Scrooge.  A comparison is unfair since the story is adapted for musical performances.  Finney makes a good Scrooge, Kenneth Moore is excellent as the Ghost of Christmas Present, and Sir Alec Guinness stars as Jacob Marley's ghost.  This film features a unique sequence when Scrooge gets a taste of his future if he doesn't mend his ways, revealing the chain he's forged as told by Jacob Marley.An interesting follow up performance was given by Alastair Sim as Scrooge's voice in a Chuck Jones' animated film in 1971.  The feature is nicely animated and worth watching, but it's currently out of print and used VHS copies are expensive to purchase.\n",
      "As usual with films that are in the public domain, trying to figure out which one to buy can sometimes be a trial.There are two companies putting this one out: United Home and VCI.  VCI put out the 50th anniversary edition as well as the colorized version (which - now don't get confused - includes the black and white version).  United Home puts out the black and white version.  However, the packaging for the United Home and VCI versions are identical.  And the 50th anniversary edition is no longer available.So.  Given that the quality of whatever is shown on TV every year gets worse and worse, I took a shot at the VCI colorized/B&W; edition since they had also put together the 50th anniversary edition (shows a certain fondness for the film).  And since I had the opportunity to watch this film on TV on Christmas Eve, I'm in a position to make an almost side by side comparison.The result is that I am impressed with what VCI was able to do with this material.  I have no idea what their source material was.  And it doesn't look or sound as though they went through the whole restoration process.  However, the improvement in sound and picture is remarkable, maybe not 5s, but at least 3.5 to 4 on the sound, and at least 4 on the picture.  And given the price, this is far more than one might expect.They don't show these old films so much these days at Christmas time: Miracle on 34th Street, Pocketful of Miracles, White Christmas, Holiday Inn, and so on.  And when they do show them, they often use ratty old tapes or film stock.Therefore, buy these DVDs now in preparation for next year, if available, and see them when and as often as you like.  DVDs do get withdrawn from circulation, and you'll be sorry if you let the opportunity to pick up this version of A Christmas Carol go by.\n",
      "Love this movie!! Dispite the cover, the movie is in B&W. This version of the classic is a must have for the holiday season!\n",
      "Actually, this is one of the finest films ever made.  It is also probably the one version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL that is truest to the book.My personal favorite is the 1970 musical version starring Albert Finney and Sir Alec Guinness.  But Alastair Sim's SCROOGE is still worthy of the annual (or multi-annual) viewing.  Not only does Sim turn in an excellent performance, but so does the entire cast.  I especially enjoyed Hermione Baddeley in the role of Mrs. Cratchit.  (I've enjoyed seeing her in many different shows including MARY POPPINS and LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE).Also, this version of Dickens's \"immortal classic\" boasts more Christian themes than any of the others (including Albert Finney's).  And I suppose that's what I like most about it.  It constantly reminds us of whose birthday we celebrate at Christmas.I think Charles Dickens would have greatly approved of this version.  For what it's worth, I know I do.\n",
      "This is my favorite performance of my favorite Christmas story.Even though this book was written over 150 years ago it is just as relevant today.Yes, giving is living.\n",
      "IT WAS THE BEST X-MAS CAROL I HAVE SEEN AND I HAVE SEEN ALOTITS THE ONE I SEE EVERY X-MAS EVEDALENSHAROND@AOL.COM\n",
      "A classic. How can you NOT like Alistair Sims as Scrooge? Black and white version is the best. Brings me back to my childhood\n",
      "This is my favorite adaptation of \"A Christmas Carol\".  Alastir Sim is a wonderful character actor and no one else comes close to being as tight, greedy and on Christmas morn, \"giddy as a school boy\".  Sim was a stage actor and his portrayal of Scrooge displays his talents from the medium of theatre.Mrs. Dilbar also stole the show, as his housemaid who stole the bedcurtains in the 'future' and the chemistry between she and Scrooge was a delight.This version of Dicken's classic is truly worthy of being added to a home DVD collection, and will be a loved tradition in your family, year after year.  (I have already watched it once since Halloween in anticipation for the holiday season).  A 5 star movie.\n",
      "This original version of the movie is the best.... Great story, remember watching when i was a young girl...\n",
      "This, Alistair Sims, version of a Christmas Carol is one of hte best ever made. You will enjoy viewing your DVD.\n",
      "Regardless to how old this movie is he is my favorite Scrooge.  They did a wonderful job crafting this movie so many years ago.\n",
      "I am a HUGE fan of this film, watching it every Christmas.  Over the years, I've just gotten used to the terrible quality.  Assuming that it was a result of the film being shot in the UK in 1951.  This Blu Ray transfer has changed that.  The black and white quality is excellent.  Yes, there is some grain, but that is expected when doing a transfer form the original 35mm negative.  Bottom line... short of a 4K transfer, this is as good as it gets.The package itself comes with the DVD version as well, which... for me... is unnecessary.  I will always watch the much cleaner Blu-Ray version.  The DVD version has a 4x3 transfer which is OK, and a 16x9 transfer, which is terrible... cutting off important parts of the frame, and making the entire film more blurry.Both the DVD and Blu Ray have the 2005 commentary for this film, which includes an expert discussing the production of this film, along with commentary from one of the original actors.If you are a fan of this film, and classic films in general, this is THE version to buy...\n",
      "Of all the \"Scrooge\" movies this is the classic in my opinion.  This is the one I grew up on through the 50's and 60's.\n",
      "My family and I love this movie, think it is the best of all versions - but for some reason they rarely show it anymore.We really enjoyed watching these movie at Christmas.  I'll just say there wasn't a dry eye in the room a couple of times (and no, it wasn't all women watching)  Impeccable casting and performance.  More insight into Scrooge than most other version, in my humble opinion.  Very Glad to add it to my collection.\n",
      "I am an incurable romantic when it comes to \"A Christmas Carol\" and this is a delightful version. Good Fun!\n",
      "This is by far, in my opinion, the best version of this classic tale out of the dozens that are out there.  I watch it every year.  Definitely worth purchasing.  Not sure why two people gave this show one star, but it definitely deserves every bit of five stars and even more.  This is a must have christmas classic.\n",
      "This is my favorite version of \"A Christmas Carol\".  Before the days of cable, I'd catch a grainy old print on the local PBS station.  Now, this absolutely fantastic looking and sounding upgrade takes its place on my DVD shelf.  The extras are excellent, too!\n",
      "There are many versions of A Christmas Carol and they are all good but this one is the best.  Alastair Sim is the best Scrooge character.  We now can watch this every year without waiting for it to hopefully come on TV!  This CD is great because it has both color and black and white versions.  The quality is outstanding.  I would highly recommend it for any family.\n",
      "Despite some tinkering with the storyline, this is the best-ever film adaptation of Dickens's classic tale about a hard-hearted old miser who rediscovers his capacity for love and kindness one Christmas Eve when ghosts force him to re-examine his life.The poignant ghost of Christmas past dredges up Scrooge's memories, good and bad, reminding him of his early idealism and the bad choices that destroyed it. The jolly ghost of Christmas present shows Scrooge a vision of joy and abundance and the goodwill in most people's hearts--and ends with a chilling reminder of need in the midst of plenty. The terrifying ghost of Christmas yet to come forces Scrooge to confront his own mortality and to see the meaninglessness of his selfish life in the starkest possible terms. Sobbing with penitence, Scrooge vows to change his ways, and when he awakens on Christmas morning his joy produces film's most delirious fit of glee.The film is perfectly true to the spirit and even the language of the original book, and drives its moral home with powerful, unforgettable performances. Alistair Sim is magnificent as Scrooge.\n",
      "To fans of this movie it is no secret that this version of the often told tale is the best.  Why would you want the Blu-ray version?  The restoration is the best ever, and the extras add more enjoyment.  I first saw this version of Dickens story on television in the early seventies.  I fell in love with the performances and was always disappointed in the visual and when it was colorized...  Well that was too much.  I bought the dvd version when it came out and while it was ok it lacked the sheen that I saw in the film version.  With the Blu-ray the sheen is back.  As usual in 1080P the film grain is visible.  On the big screen you can enjoy a very filmic display.  I loved it and found it the most satisfying version to date.\n",
      "I've been looking to purchase for many years. Doesn't seem like Christmas if I don't watch it. No longer on tv. Absolute favorite version!\n",
      "Very pleased with this DVD.  It is one which we watch every year and the quality is excellent. Highly recommended!\n",
      "I purchased this blu-ray after last Xmas, so this is the first chance I have had to watch it. The video remastering is excellent and drastically reduces the artifacts that were previously visible in many of the special effects (I notice that they did not remove the brief accidental \"crew\" shot in the mirror in one scene, however). The special features are also very interesting, although skewed toward an American audience. It also appears that the subtitle text was provided by an American (or a very young...post decimalization... British person) since there are a number of mistakes, particularly regarding British idioms.  Incidentally, the use of the expression, \"Bob's your uncle,\" is an anachronism. It was not coined until the late 1800s, about 50 years after Dicken's wrote \"A Christmas Carol.\"My only complaint is that there are several seconds of audio dropout in the 5.1 soundtrack (not in the stereo track). This happens at the beginning of the scene where a revitalized Scrooge visits his nephew's house. I don't know if this is common to all copies or just peculiar to mine.\n",
      "I think this is the very best production of A Christmas Carol.  It shows heart felt repentance on Scrooge's part and what a changed life really looks like.  Loved it and watch it every Christmas.  Finally glad I bought my own copy.\n",
      "This is my favorite version of A Christmas Carol.  I think the B/W gives a more dark and gloomy atmosphere,  you can almost feel the cold in the counting house and in Scrooge's home.  Alastair Sim is wonderful.....completely self absorbed in the beginning, childlike with his delight at finding that he has not missed Christmas, and kind and generous at the end.  The other cast members are wonderful as well....Bob Cratchit and his family,  Marley's ghost, the Spirits.  All great!\n",
      "The product came a little after it was promised but we enjoyed watching it anyway. The quality of the movies are great. It is nice to have both the color and the black and white editions. The price was very reasonable. I would definitely recommend purchasing these movies.\n",
      "This is the best Christmas movie ever.  The black & white version is the one to watch.\n",
      "of all the \"Christmas Carols\" ever made.  We had this on VHS and it was originally titled:  \"Scrooge\".  It is the only version that makes me and our adult son tear up when Tiny Tim isn't by his place at the hearth.\n",
      "One of my favorite versions of Scrooge.  The actor that plays Tiny Tim is a bit large for the role.  But, that's a small thing.\n",
      "I refer to the entire cast and crew as having made this magnificentversion as indeed a 'Labor of Love'. They all obviously cared deeplyabout bringing the best of Dickens to the big-screen and succeeded. Theoutdoor London 'sets' where several outdoor scenes of the offices ofMarley and Scrooge are shot are now long gone, real buildings from theVictorian era that survived the 'Blitz' of WW II. And the indoor setswere so well done, the flavor of the period well done.Alastair Sim as Scrooge is marvelous, a wonderful turn by this fineactor. But he is never better then when he awakens on Christmas Morning.Dancing, singing, doing gymnastics! The pure joy on his face when heinquires of Mrs. Dilber the housekeeper, played by Kathleen Harrison,'what day is today'? And she responds 'Christmas Day' and his elationthat he hasn't missed Christmas. Or the following scenes with thehousekeeper.  She thinks him quite mad! And why not? Hadn't he already,in his sleeping gown, done a hand-stand on a chair, and she, screaming,running out of his chambers with her apron over her face. When hecatches her up on the stairs and presses a golden coin in her hand shepulls away at first, wondering what he wants from her. His face showsher that all is well, a wonderful bit of acting in these two scenes bySim and Harrison.Wonderful acting throughout, good sets, well shot and lit, a memorable'Scrooge'/'A Christmas Carol'. I have the VHS version but now watch theLD. Avoid the colorized version, my opinion. The colors just never lookright. Besides, the sets and lighting were done for B & W. Also, the LDhas far superior contrast then VHS could ever offer. Those who don'thave LD, I'm certain the DVD will be a joy. Regardless, buy a copy, evenif only VHS. Remember that the Christmas season really only begins onChristmas Eve and runs to January 6. Plenty of time to buy and watchthis during the holidays. But see Leonard Maltin. Watch it anytime!One last thing, note the production error in the Christmas Morning scenewhen Sim as Scrooge is dancing merrily about his bedchamber. Fewreviewers ever mention this. Have you noticed it?!\n",
      "Gene Shalit said, \"There have been at least eight movie versions [of A Christmas Carol] . . . but the single enduring version is the 1951 film starring Alastair Sim as Ebenezer Scrooge . . . an incomparable Christmas present.\"  If this is your favorite version of A Christmas Carol, you should definitely buy this collector's edition.If you haven't seen this version, let me characterize it for you.  The film story closely follows the Dickens original with its emphasis on how Ebenezer Scrooge went from being a caring person who wanted to do good for others to someone who only cared about money, until four spirits (his dead partner, Jacob Marley; Christmas past; Christmas current; and Christmas future) visit him and scare Scrooge into reforming which he does on Christmas day.  The acting is often overdone, featuring overreactions of the sort that were popular in vaudeville and silent pictures.  Many of the actors seem miscast because they are quite plump and prosperous looking, even though they are supposed to be quite poor (this is especially true of Mervyn Johns who plays bob Cratchit, Scrooge's browbeaten, underpaid clerk.).  Naturally spirits require special effects and those are pretty primitive due to the year of the film.So why do people like it?  For me, the acting by Alastair Sim as old Scrooge, Patrick MacNee as young Jacob Marley, and Glyn Dearman as Tiny Tim were not only first-rate, they moved me in many ways.  Dickens's concept for the story is also pure genius.  There is also some wonderful signing of Christmas carols to get you in the mood.  It was nice to see such a good performance . . . especially if I didn't look too closely at the actors who didn't please me.As I watched the original version, I found myself thinking about the choices made by the producer, director, and scriptwriters for about the first 20 minutes.  But midway through the appearance of Jacob Marley in Scrooge's house, I found myself forgetting that I was watching a movie and just enjoyed the story from there.The experience reminded me of watching old black-and-white films on the tiny screen of the Brattle Theater near Harvard Square.  It was a good feeling.Next, I looked at the expanded black-and-white version that includes the ability to fill a wide screen.  This looked better, but I didn't like it as well.  It didn't take me back into the world of how movies were made in 1951 as successfully.Finally, I watched the colorized version . . . and hated it as I do almost all colorized black-and-white movies.  But what can you do?  Some people only want to watch color movies.After that, I watched the 1935 version of the movie and found the quality to be so poor that it annoyed me.  I gave up after about 15 minutes, thinking that I'll pick up there some other time.  The 1935 version has several good qualities:  the casting seems generally better, the contrasts between rich and poor are better developed, the sense of being in Dickens' London is stronger.Watching the 1935 version made me quite appreciative of the good work done by VCI Entertainment.  The images are clear, the lighting is consistent, the sound is understandable, and you don't feel like you are watching celluloid that's about to break.For those who love all the details, you'll enjoy the various special features which include:Before and after restoration comparisonPhoto and press book galleryCast biosOriginal trailersCommentaries by Marcus Hearn and George Cole about \"Spirit of Christmas Past,\" Alastair Sim, and George Minter (executive producer)Toss away your \"Bah, humbugs\" and get in the Christmas Spirit!\n",
      "This is one of the best made version of this wonderful tale!! Alistare Simm is a great Scrooge.  A \"must have\" for your collection.\n",
      "This has been a family favorite for many years, and until this edition I had vhs copies in black and white, and one in color, but with this edition I now have both on one cd.  It has been a tradition to view this every Christmas Eve, and will remain so..\n",
      "I recieved the product on time. It is by my standards the best version there is. It is true to the original story. Wonderfull.\n",
      "As I was growing up every Christmas my family would watch 'A ChristmasCarol' also known as 'Scrooge' ...we found the 1951 version withAlastair Simms to be the best.I have always received excellent service from Amazon when ordering online.Delivery is prompt, you can track your order....This 'Ultimate Collector's Edition' offers two DVD's in both the originalBlack and White as well as the excellent colourized version....Both are wonderful and may be enjoyed for years to come by all ...Thank you, Amazon, once again you have provided me with the best serviceever.Don Oliphant, Langley, B.C., Canada\n",
      "Probably my favorite verison of  A Christmas Carol. Alastair Sim was so funny! I love the scene where he stands on his head and the housekeeper thinks he's crazy....\n",
      "My very favorite Christmas movie.  It's just not Christmas without Alastir Sim's Christmas Carol. The one Christmas ghost story that gets you in the Christmas spirit...\n",
      "I've seen many versions, but this 1959 'Christmas Carol' with Alistair Sim is the best ever made.  This Amazon package included the original in black and white, a colorized version, and a 1935 version.  It's more than worth the money I paid for it.\n",
      "This is the definitive version of Dicken's book.  Sim is fabulous as Scrooge.  You feel the passion of his performace as you wend your way through.  His Scrooge as well as the spirits helps set the proper mood for every Christmas season.  I consider it a special treat to watch this every year.  Before I had it on tape I used to watch the tv listings to see which station it would be on so I could make sure to see it.  I would not do anything else while this was on.  Just watched it again.  Never get tired of it.  This is the number one holiday movie.\n",
      "This movie is one of our favorite movies and definitely one of the best Christmas movies out.\n",
      "I have watched this original version of A Christmas Carol, and have seen the others as well.  This is the only one worth watching, the others are only poor imitations.\n",
      "I bought this for my grandmother as a Christmas gift.  Her old VHS copy was bad and she needed to call me over every year to hook everything up and get it running.  The DVD makes things much easier.  Like a lot of you, I also believe this version, with these actors, was the best of the movies.\n",
      "Bring back the memories of Christmas with an updated version of a great classic.  It is done well and I enjoy it.\n",
      "I've read the other reviews listed here for this version of A Christmas Carol (or \"Scrooge\" as the movie was originally titled), and there isn't much more praise I can add that hasn't already been given.Just a few thoughts, though.  I've given the movie 5 stars, which is usually reserved for perfection, although this movie isn't \"perfect\" according to a few other reviews.  However, the movie transcends any mistakes it may have by the sheer force of Alastair Sim's performance.  He is/was a genius.  I don't think there will be another actor that can match his portrayal of Scrooge.This year, I've had a difficult time getting into the Christmas spirit.  The holidays are usually more stressful to me than a joy.  Last night I watched this movie on television, and my \"humbug\" attitude flew out the window.  How can one watch this movie and not be deeply moved by Scrooge's transformation?  Now, I'm ready for Christmas (and buying the DVD!).\n",
      "This item was to add to our own holiday classics DVD colletcion.  I was happy to find this copy as this is our family's favorite version. It's a classic.  We enjoyed it!\n",
      "1951's British version of \"A Christmas Carol\" is perhaps the standard movie edition of the popular Charles Dickens classic.  Delivered in crisp black and white, with its focus on the original story and not on special effects, it delivers the haunting message of Dickens' novella in a way that the many subsequent versions do not.Alistair Sims is superb as Scrooge, easily and believably making the transition from grasping miser to a reformed man of Christmas spirit.  We see Ebenezer rise from neglected schoolboy to poor but generous clerk to rich and ambitious businessman to stingy miser before confronting the three Christmas Spirits who change his life.  His transformation is delivered with obvious physical joy, as he capers like a schoolboy and humbles himself to visit his disowned nephew.Brian Hurst's direction is direct and brisk, as an excellent cast steps through the story in just 86 minutes, without missing a single key element.  The Bob Crachitt family is especially well-cast, their sequences together fairly hum with genuine family feeling.Unlike many of the later versions, this production makes the point that Ebenezer Scrooge must be frightened into good sense by the three ghosts, not entertained by them.  At the same time, the ghosts are presented as the ultimately humane spirits they must be to give Scrooge hope for redemption.This movie is highly recommended to fans of a great Christmas classic and those looking for a Christmas movie that imparts a real message.\n",
      "As with many things crafted in the old days, this older version of Dickens' classic is by far the finest.  Although the George C. Scott attempt was very good, nothing can touch this one.  It not only captures the very essence of the story with expert structure, pacing, characterization, set design and costume -- but spirit as well.  Once you have seen the eccentric Alistair Sim in his tour de force portrayal of  Scrooge, it is very hard, if not impossible, to imagine the irascible Ebinezer in anyone else's skin.  A Christmas without a viewing of this wonderful movie seems incomplete and is a tradition in our household.\n",
      "I bought this for my sister as a gift. She loves Allister Sim, and had to have this for her movie collection. Not my taste, but she highly recommends this classic retelling of the Dickens story.\n",
      "The very best version of Scrooge. Alastair Sim owns the role. The rest of the cast, the sets and costumes are first rate. I purchased this copy to replace my dvd copy that somehow was damaged. The colorized version is far better than what I would have expected. I always has seen the movie in B/W and thought colorizing it would not not. Surprise!\n",
      "Of all the versions of this movie out there, this original is by far the best. Alister Sim gives a superb performance that pulls us into the sadness, the fear, the love, and the joy, and the comedy too of this wonderful Dickens classic. It's a Christmas tradition at my house, and I will always have a fondness for the original  B+W version too. Watch it and experience the true meaning of Christmas.\n",
      "I cannot stop watching this oddly amazing older version of The Christmas Carol. Sim is incredibly funny, and the cast is incredible. But he seems to be more generous in this version than in any other version. He becomes exhilerated come Christmas morning after the 4 ghosts give Scrooge a visit. They take him through time, and everything fits. I especially like the ghost of Christmas Future. He is the most haunting and scary. He doesn't talk and has no face and show Scrooge of his death soon if he doesn't bring his act together. After waking up from his dream, he evn raises the salary of his maid. Plus, he gives his employee Christmas day off, unlike any other version. Tiny Tim and his family, Scrooge's nephew and niece, and Marley also all add a great touch in this film highly thought of by me. So buy it!\n",
      "This film has been a part of my life since my earliest Christmas memories. My dad made it part of every Christmas morning when we were kids - after presents were opened of course. Forty years ago we watched in between watching the NASA moon mission. This black and white digital restoration is so much more satisfying than the colorized version previously available (though it can be found on the second disk). Watching it as a child I remember darkness all around the edges of the screen (which I must admit increased the spooky factor) but this version offers every single detail of the alternately lush and bleak production: the textures of the clothing, the details in the toyshop window, even a glimpse of the face of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come. The excellent dramatic pacing, rich characterization, tour de force performance from Alastair Sim, high production values and terrific score are all there but now all is bathed in crystal clear light. If you love this old chestnut give yourself a treat and pick this 2 disk special edition up; if you have never seen it, well you haven't really seen Christmas Carol. Extensive dvd extras make the whole experience even richer - a great package.\n",
      "Still my favorite theatrical treatment of the Dicken's classic.  The colorized version included in the set was okay, though I thought some of the color choices seemed a bit off, particularly making the Ghost of Christmas Present's cloak red instead of green.Also, think the inclusion of the 1935 version from the London Studio is a good idea (though I already own it on a separate DVD)for those who may not realize for how long or how often this story had been interpretted on film.\n",
      "Alastair Sim is the definitive characterization of the immortal Scrooge.  His performance is genuinely three dimensional showing the multiple aspects of the changing Scrooge.  This version also gives the very best description  of his past, laying a foundation for his actions.  I would however  recommened the colorized version.  It enhances the quality of the film and  makes some scenes (such as the wondering spirits) much clearer. My  apologies to the purists, but I like color.  The very best version of the  25 versions that I have.  A must for any Scrooge fan.\n",
      "I can't believe I ordered in the pm and received it the next am.  Wow, best service ever on line.\n",
      "One of several verions which follow the original Dickens story fairly closely. Added scenes include some dealing with Scrooge & Marley's advancements from apprentice to business partners, and Marley's death. Although black & white, it will still capture the fancy of the entire family. Excellent addition to a Christmas collection.\n",
      "Christmas Carol  DVD package was exactly what I wanted, arrived on time, package well wrapped, easy to open.  Had no problems, it came just in time for x-mas.\n",
      "My Christmas was never complete if unable to see what I thought was the original \"Christmas Carol\" with Alistair Sim and it had been years since last able to see it locally. What I received in my order from Amazon was totally unexpected. For the price I was expecting a washed out, grainy copy of my beloved childhood memory; but better than nothing. The set included two disks; one with the original b/w version re-mastered in different formats and the other with a colorized version (sacrilege!) and an earlier 1922 version which is a real gem. The video and audio quality in all four is excellent. The set arrived just in time for Christmas eve and viewing it after so many years flooded back those childhood memories of many Chrismases past. Oh, and after watching it several times, I noticed in the starting credits that the name of the film is \"Scrooge\".\n",
      "A lot of men have played Ebenezer Scrooge over the years, but NONE with the accuracy, passion and believability of Alastair Sim... This man simple BECAME Scrooge! All performances from then on were merely attempts to capture the magic he captured in this brilliant adaptation of the classic Christmas tale.(Okay so maybe Michael Caine in the MUPPET VERSION but I digress...)This story remains a classic... and the original version with Alastair Sim is one to be enjoyed by generations.My dad enjoyed it as a child. I enjoyed it as a child and now my son enjoys it... A tradition in the truest sense.\n",
      "Clearly the best version I have ever seen.It has been a family tradition for all of the family to sit and enjoy this classic. Before VCR came along I always searched the T.V guide to be sure it was being aired on Christmas eve.One little tidbit, when Scrooge is joyfully romping around the bedroom on Christmas morning,he is looking in a mirror. If you look closley you will see the director in the mirror as well in both scenes.\n",
      "Spring and autumn are my favorite seasons, and I am in my glory as I have already swung back into golf action, but Christmas is a year-round preparation. Homage to Christmas stores must be observed, and bounties must be accumulated to ensure the next one is more festive than the last.But waiting for good Christmas stories to come to TV are as elusive as a hole-in-one. With not one showing of the 1951 production of Dickens' \"Christmas Carol,\" this past Christmas season I had had enough, and determined to remedy the situation. I bought this on DVD in its pure black and white version and one that has been colorized. I will be introducing this story to my great niece and great nephews as they plan their destruction of my home next Christmas.There are several productions of \"A Christmas Carol\" besides the 1951 version, one before and several since, but none of them shine for sheer acting, drama, and direction as this one does. It is the classic of classics. Use of an old ballad, \"Barbara Allen\" only adds to the emotion and enchantment of the story.For those who know nothing about a Christmas Carol, there is a miserly fellow named Ebenezer Scrooge (Alastair Sim) who has achieved wealth and power through cynicism of the human character while losing any empathy and warmth he may have had earlier in life in his climb toward success.It is Christmas Eve and his sleep becomes a nightmare with visits from the Ghosts of the Christmas Past, Present, and Future.  He gets to cower in front of his dead partner who warns him to change his ways. He gets to see the suffering of his faithful and timid employee, Bob Cratchit (Mervyn Johns). Finally, he gets to see the future and what people thought of him. What effect will the dreams have on a man so disposed to contempt for the poor and wretched? In order to find out, you will have to watch this movie. The book is also available.A phenomenal cast rounds out the story that is said to be the truest to the masterpiece novella. The acting has the power to bring tears to your eyes as you empathize with their misery and joy. Alastair Sim's performance makes him an acting icon. It is so moving, that this \"Christmas Carol\" is not only considered to be the best version, but the very best of Christmas stories and the Christmas spirit.Don't miss the story, or the spirit.\n",
      "Each year in the past we always searched for this on a tv schedual---some years never found so we have decided to invest in our own copy with Amazon---best decision we ever made!!! This particular copy was new and despite the original movie being decades old---the sound and quality were excellent!!!! This movie is more traditional than the modern (childlike) versions with some memorable scenes. So much in this made a viewer think about our own lives and seeing a bit of Scrooge in each of us-and that it is not too late to change our ways---Scrooge did!!!!great classic movie!!!\n",
      "This is my favorite version of A Christmas Carol. I have so many memories of watching it with my family and it really gets me into the spirit of Christmas. This is a lovely DVD and one I will be enjoying for years to come. Merry Christmas!\n",
      "I have 8 versions of A Christmas Carol that I watch every year (the 9th being Bill Murray's Scrooged that I watch less frequently).  Of them all, this is my favorite.  The fact that it also features John Steed (Patrick Macnee) is a huge plus.  In this one, I appreciate the attempt to maintain most of the classic story by Dickens.  But, there are some additions and some notable omissions in this version too.  Still, it's the best of the lot.  In particular, I love the duplicitous charwoman played to perfection by Kathleen Harrison.  (Although I still can't understand what she thought she had to gain by throwing her apron over her head to escape the clutches of the reformed Scrooge.)In this version there's definitely more grave than gravy to be had.\n",
      "This version of A Christmas Carol is my favorite. I love the way Alistair Sim transforms from the evil Scrooge to the loveable Scrooge.\n",
      "I was concerned before buying it because of a negative review I read here about the above topic.  The other reviews were positive thus overruling the bad one.Today I watched and I was impressed.  The colorization and remasterization has taken this Christmas classic to new heights making it a must for every home that celebrates Christmas and owns a DVD player.Both sound and picture are vastly improved.  The colorized version adds a new and fresh dimension to an already warm and welcomed visitor in our living rooms.If you don't have it and are wondering if you should buy it, stop wondering and click it right now into your cart.  You won't go wrong.\n",
      "Played flawlessly. I remember the first time I watched this as a child. Later I would watch it every X-mas eve at midnight. As far as I am concerned this is the only version.\n",
      "Watch it in Color OR Black & White!  Love it!  Add it to your collection.  Our favorite version of the story.\n",
      "Dickens purists, myself among them, must admit that there are liberties taken in this presentation to which \"Boz\" would take great exception. For example, the home of the impoverished Bob Cratchitt is more luxurious than that of most viewers', and, miserable sort though Scrooge was, he did NOT put Fezziwig out of business. With this said, I must admit the film is generally quite delightful.Sim \"fleshes out\" the character of Scrooge (who, in this version, happily is allowed to be a redeemed miser - there is none of the \"psychology\" that would flavour some later remakes), making all aspects of the narrative highly believable. Excellent acting and a general period flavour are a delectable and enduring combination, and one even a purist finds quite addictive.\n",
      "After first seeing Alastair Sim's characterization of Ebeneezer Scrooge, every other version (film or TV) was disappointing.  In my view, Alastair Sim was the epitome of the character and his acting was exceptional.  I also appreciated all the other actors in their roles. The whole production was just absolutely grand. This version and this story must always be viewed by me and my family every Christmas. It puts us all just right into the spirit of the season. Great acting, great production, great film!!!!\n",
      "It simply isn't Christmas without Alastair Sims' Scrooge in the definitive Christmas film, A Christmas Carol.Thank you, Amazon, for making this masterpiece so easy to get.  Now I can be sure of enjoying it each Christmas.I loved the scene in which Scrooge realizes it is still Christmas and he is not to late to express his new-found joy!\n",
      "my favorite charles dickens a christmas there are alot of but this is my favorite i enjoy and i would rcommed thanks\n",
      "Bottom line review: This movie looks and sounds great on Blu-Ray. This version of \"A Christmas Carol\" is most likely the most definitive version. I loved the story as a child and loved the movie versions. I have watched pretty much every contemporary version available, and this version is without question THE version to have. Buy it and enjoy it!\n",
      "I watched this again on Christmas.  This is the unequaled version which EVERYONE should own.  It has three discs, the original, cleaned-up film, the colourized version and a copy of a 1935 version of the classic tale.  The latter does not have captions nor English subtitles, unfortunately, but the other two do.  There are numerous versions of this classic Dickens story, but, none compare with the Alastair Sim version... It is incomparable and will be cherished for all time I believe.  Everyone should own it.\n",
      "Nothing beats the end of this movie, period.  If you haven't seen it take the time, it is black and white, but it is scripted and filmed the way Dickens would have wanted.  Alistar Sim is by far the BEST Scrooge!\n",
      "Best version going, hands down!. Your rating method lacks specificity.  Great that this old version retains it's value over the years.\n",
      "This is by far my favorite version of this story.  Originally in Black+White, no colorizing is needed, and I prefer it that way. Great literature deserves the best of treatments, as is done here. Alistair Sim IS Scrooge.My siblings and I would watch it on Christmas Eve, the lights off, with just some candles lit.  Great memories.I HIGHLY recommend this version over all the others.\n",
      "We needed to get a new copy of this classic movie as our old one was on VHS.  This new copy on CD brought this old movie back to life for us with a higher quality than our VHS version.\n",
      "This movie is the best \"Christmas Carol\" version with Alister Sim made in 1957. I was looking for the colored version in DVD as I had a video only which i was trying to replace and found it at Amazon.com. For those who like the black and white version you will be happy to know they sent both versions.\n",
      "This is a wonderful collection! Not only does it have the one of the Best versions of Christmas Carol ever recorded, it also contains an older edition and the colorized version. (Although I much prefer the black and white).  We watched it Christmas Eve this year and I think we'll continue to do so as a tradition in our family!\n",
      "Watching this movie is a tradition in my family. Christmas doesn't seem like Christmas without seeing this movie at least once during the season.\n",
      "Dickens story is timeless. This is one of my \"must watch each Christmas\" movies. A real indictment of Victorian thinking\n",
      "I've been watching this movie every year at Christmas time for years, and loved it even with all the scratches and pops.  This copy has been re-mastered and looks as though it were recorded yesterday with modern technology.  The audio and video quality is just fantastic.\n",
      "This is the only Christmas Carol I remember watching as a little girl. We made a point to watch it every Christmas as a family. Now I continue that tradition and enjoy it every time. Highly recommend it.\n",
      "The best Scrooge ever ! Don't bother with any other, i don't care who did it.  This is the straight story by DIckens, with the best cast, director, cinematographer, etc.  Get it :]\n",
      "I've watched this film so many times, I know all the lines. This is not just the best telling of Dickens tale, but a classic film for all time, all seasons. Alistair Sim is incomprable as Scrooge. All the actors are wonderful, they so perfectly convey the feeling of 19th century London. Look for Patrick McNee, who later gained fame as \"John Steed\" in the wonderful \"Avengers\", as the young Jacob Marley, and Hermione Baddely, who was an accomplished stage actress and favorite of Tennessee Williams, she also later played \"Mrs. Naugatuct\",the tipsy housekeeper, on t.v.'s \"Maude\", as Mrs. Bob Cratchet. The only reason to see any of the other versions is to reinforce just how superior this one is, though the Reginald Owen and George C. Scott versions are respectable. I found the Patrick Stewart version abominable, as expected. This is too good a film to be watched only once a year, it will transport you so realisticly to Olde London. And the storys lessons of forgiveness and remorse are just as meaningful now as then. Oh, not to ruin the illusion, but in the scene when Scrooge awakens Christmas Day, after having had his \"epiphany\", watch as he's looking in the mirror, as he tells his housekeeper about his ordeal. You will see, reflected in the mirror, the reflection of a modern-day (circa 1950) person, more than likely one of the crew. Don't know if this bit of trivia is common knowledge, but I find it interesting. Also, though Simm is only known by most for his role as Scrooge, check out his very funny \"St. Trinians\" films, where he plays headmaster at a boys school. A wonderful, different look at this great actor. This heartwarming film will be THE Christmas classic for all time.POSTSCRIPT!!!I just noticed I reviewed the \"colorized\" version. DANGER!! DANGER!! Do NOT watch this version, it MUST be seen in black & white!!! WHAT was I thinking??!!!!\n",
      "Everyone should be familiar with Charles Dickens' small but eternal story of 'A Christmas Carol'.  This tale of the supernatural has been read and re-read for years.  Each Christmas just move around the television channels and you can find a different version of this story.  Some are ok. Some are weak. Some are excellent.  This Alastair Sim's version is excellent.  It has all the Dicken's story of the...tight-fisted, squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner's..redemption to...Tiny Tim's second father and as good a friend, as good a master and as good a man as the good old city knew.  It's older movie technology in comparing it to George C Scott's version, but that's where the charm lies.\n",
      "This 1951 (Alastair Sim) version to many is the best version of the Charles Dickens short story classic, \"A Christmas Carol\".  I do enjoy Alastair Sim as Scrooge. With a colorized version included it helps to introduce new generations (they seem to be tramatized by black and white) to this English classic. An annual viewing is traditional. A nice addition to the Christmas library. I only hope that the 1938 and 1970 will follow into the DVD arena (soon). Not this year.\n",
      "A Christmas tradition every year is to watch some media version of Dicken's Classic \"A Christmas Carol\", Of all the scores of versions which have come out over the years in color, animation, with lots of computer inhancements, NONE hold a candle to this 1951 British adaptation of the classic short story,For decades I have annually watched this wonderful Alistar Simms (he is Scrooge) version with eager anticipation, launching the holiday season spirit.This dark and very faithful to Dickens story is creepy and heart warming, for sure.NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS MASTERPIECE IS AVAILABLE IN BLU-RAY (1080p) A REMASTERED COPY FROM THE ORIGINAL 35mm PRINT.  SIMPLY, ASTONISHING!!!! WITH 5.1 SOUND AND HD PICTURE THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!!  THE PICTURE QUALITY AND SOUNDTRACK  MAKE THIS FILM SO VERY REAL TO LIFE.  YOUR IMAGINATION, YOUR NERVES and HEART FELT JOY are soo PEAKED AND TUNED INTO THIS HOLIDAY CLASSIC!!!!  A MUST HAVE!!!  AN ANNUAL TRADITION TO BEGIN AGAIN!!!Also included is the standard DVD version in 4:3 and 16:9 format.  (Remember widescreen was begun in 1953.)  Audio commentary (kind of random information is provided) is also included.ENJOY!!!\n",
      "I purchased this because it was the only one to watch, and it still is the best! After all the remakes, this makes me remember watching it with my cousins at my grandmothers!\n",
      "The definitive \"A Christmas Carol.This one grows on you. I had grown up hearing Lionel Barrymore as Scrooge, and preferred him over all others. Still wish he had done it for film.\n",
      "Finally a good copy of a classic Christmas tale.  The Blu-ray disc has cleaned up what had been a messy film from the past.  This film of Scrooge played by Alistair has always been my favorite but it had been chewed up and spit out so many times that it was nearly unrecognizable.  Now that it had been digitized and put onto Blu-ray it is once more the classic tale for the Christmas season.\n",
      "Like most Americans of a similar age I grew up watching this movie on TV during the Christmas season along with all the other Christmas movies and TV specials, but as a boy I wasn't especially impressed with it.  It was in black and white; the film was noticeably dirty and scratched; there wasn't much singing, and worst of all, it wasn't a cartoon!  However, in a one-TV house you watched what your parents wanted to watch, or you did without so I remember watching parts of this version many times over the years though never all the way through until I received this DVD.  Though it wasn't my cup of tea at the time, even as a child I recognized the power of Alistair Sim's definitive performance, one of the best of his distinguished career (though personally I still prefer his dual parts tour-de-force in The Belles Of St. Trinian's which I believe is also long over due for a film restoration and a 2-disk Ultimate Collector's Edition treatment.  HINT!  HINT!  Oh, HINT!)The first thing you will notice is the extraordinary beauty of the film restoration; it literally looks brand new!  You have a choice of two aspect ratios: \"full screen\" and \"widescreen\", though the \"widescreen\" in this case didn't add back too much missing material at the edges.  (It is intended more for widescreen TVs, but it makes it easier to read subtitles if you use them.)  Seeing the movie from start to finish also convinced me, if I had any doubts left, that this is the one and only film version.  Other than giving Yet Another distinguished actor the chance to sink his teeth into this magnificent role, why bother to remake it?The extras are primarily of interest to film buffs.  The audio commentary is mostly George Cole (Young Scrooge) reminiscing with Marcus Hearn about his own long and distinguished career; on more than one occasion Marcus asks George a specific question about the film that George has no knowledge or recollection of, which leads to an embarrassing pause before Marcus prods George into talking about something he is more familiar with -- his friendships with Sim and several of the other performers.The unrestored (1989) colorized version is worth watching if only to remind yourself why colorization wasn't such a hot idea after all, but you will want to watch the bookend spoken pieces by Patrick Macnee, of \"The Avengers\" fame, who speaks of his love for this story and this version of it while utterly failing to mention his minor part in it (Young Marley) as his screen debut.  The unrestored (1935) version of \"Scrooge\" included on the same disk will mostly have you questioning the sanity of those movie reviewers who compared it FAVORABLY with the Sim version when the latter first came out.Finally, it might be worthwhile to reflect upon just exactly what was the \"sin\" of Scrooge and Marley?  It wasn't being moneylenders, that most useful of professions to the non-wealthy of any time period, providing them the opportunity to purchase big ticket items, like a house, with the opportunity to enjoy them while they are still paying for them.  Nor was it turning an honest profit.  Friendly old Fezziwig is favorably compared with Scrooge in many ways, but in the end Fezziwig let down the employees he cared for by failing to maintain a business profitable enough to continue to employ them.  It was rather their all consuming, blasphemously worshipful lust for money, and, particularly in Scrooge's case, the unnecessary cruelty and heartlessness with which he conducted business and lived his life, making everyone around him (and arguably even himself) miserable.\"A Christmas Carol\" has long proven a stumbling block to devout Christians because of its seeming endorsement of being saved by good works, but IMHO that is because they mistake Marley's and Scrooge's true spiritual condition.  If you consider Marley and Scrooge as being (extremely) backslidden Christians rather than as being unsaved non-Christians, the theology of the story now makes perfect sense.  While it is impossible for anyone to \"earn\" his salvation by \"good\" works, it being a free gift from God, it is also impossible for a Christian once truly saved to ever \"lose\" his salvation by \"bad\" works.  However, such a Christian can forfeit any and all rewards for good service above and beyond simple salvation by \"bad\" behavior, which would appear to describe Marley's condition, and \"bad\" behavior can eventually lead to God deciding that the best thing to do is to shorten this life so you'll do less damage, which appears to be what Scrooge is being warned about.  Christians were specifically and repeatedly commanded by Jesus to behave so much better towards others as to call attention to the reason for it -- their religious faith.  Christians whose behavior is actually worse than that of the average non-Christian are \"asking for it\" and certainly cannot count on a divine visitation of the sort that 2-by-4-ed Ebenezer Scrooge back upon the straight and narrow.\n",
      "At the bottom of this review, there is a tiny bit of trivia, and I hope you'll like what I discovered. It's just some trivial tidbit stuff, that's all... So now, the review:If you are changing to the DVD format from VHS, throw away your OLDER VHS tape and purchase this! The much older VHS tapes hadn't been remastered from the original print, which was discovered in England. The picture quality is so much better than those older 3rd- and fourth- generation tapes and broadcasts we've seen where everything seems like \"Scrooge\" was filmed in a fog. The contrast in the DVD is sharp and brilliant. The darks are deep yet the whites aren't at all washed out. Trust me, purchase the remastered version (I'm sure they also have released a remastered version in VHS, but I have converted to DVD).The DVD has something for everyone, God bless us all. I watched the colorized version, but it seems... colorized. It simply doesn't have that warm, saturated, natural tone of movies filmed with color stock. Some may feel that younger people might in some way enjoy the colorized movie better, but try showing it to them in B&W first. Give them the chance to see the original which has stood the test of time, and for good reason. I still admire any DVD producer that takes advantage of the versatility of the options that can be pressed into the DVD format, and VCI Entertainment gave the consumer the choice. The black & white version is on one side, and just flip the double- sided disc over for the color version.There are added features including a Max Fleischer cartoon of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. Although it was filmed in Technicolor, there was a very noticable color shift that occured in the original print. The audio wasn't that great, either. And honestly, it's not nearly as enjoyable as the animated puppet version that we used to see on CBS television with the Charlie Brown cartoon.Also included is an introduction by Patrick Macnee, who you remember as John Steed in the TV series \"The Avengers.\" I didn't understand at first why he was introducing the movie until I found that he played a bit part in \"Scrooge (Macnee failed during his introduction to say whom he played).\" So, I'll tell you:  Look for him as the young Jacob Marley, early in the film, when Scrooge (Alastair Sim) is guided by the Spirit of Christmas Past (Michael Dolan). There is a 4- page color pamphlet included. One page shows a repro of an cute, yet quirky little original movie poster. Another has chapter stop and movie info. The inside pages are devoted to other DVD movie titles.Okay, now the tidbit! What people liked about \"Scrooge\" is that the characters produced some more spontaneously funny moments that break the otherwise dark and gloomy tone of the story. Those of you who have watched \"Bride of Frankenstein\" have probably noted the similarities that I will describe! There are two characters in the \"Scrooge\" movie that I could have sworn mimicked two other characters in a different flick. The maid, Mrs. Dilber (Kathleen Harrison) in \"Scrooge\" seemed so much like the maid, Minnie (Una O'Connor) in \"Bride of Frankenstein.\" Watch the similarities in how the characters play off each other in the different movies (Mrs. Dilber with Mr. Stretch, the undertaker [Ernest Thesiger] in \"Scrooge;\" Minnie with Dr. Pretorius [also played by Thesiger!]) I actually just discovered that Thesiger played in both movies! Maybe the producer and/or director of \"Scrooge\" tapped some ideas from the light moments between Mrs. Dilber and Mr. Stretch from the Frankenstein flick, but it worked. (I love that name, \"Stretch!\") Enjoy.\n",
      "I think this version of Dickens' classic is by far the best ever made, and there have been quite a few.  Alistair Sim was to Scrooge what Yul Brynner was to the King of Siam...imitated but never equalled.  I have been watching this film since I was a boy and have never tired of it.  The enhanced video is superb, something we never saw on broadcast TV.  I have a copy on VHS tape which I never looked at, having instead watched it on broadcast TV during the holidays and I'm sure the video quality is nowhere nearly as good as this.  Also, I was pleased to see that the film had not been colorized...some films are just best left alone in that regard...If Ted Turner ever gets his hands on it, that's the end of that!  I work evenings and play around on my computer until very late when I get home.  When I found the film on Amazon, on BLU-RAY DVD no less, I couldn't believe my good fortune and wasted no time in ordering it at some unholy hour when others were asleep.  Incidentally, I was surprised at how quickly it was delivered, two, perhaps three days...GREAT JOB AMAZON!\n",
      "The classic version of a christmas carol also known as scrooge(originally titled).Alastair sims portrayal of scrooge is without a doubt the best of all,an outstanding 1951 gem which knocks out all others before and after.This is vci's third time to rerelease the 1951 classic.now on disc one we have two versions,one being full screen which shows it has been restored and cleaned up than the previous two releaseS.the scratches and sometimes frame skipping and even soundtrack has been cleaned up.Now on the other hand the widescreen version is a dissapointment it is the full frame with black bars on the top and bottom thus giving you less of a picture,when you compare both features you will notice the difference.Now on disc two is even more of a let down.disc two contains the color version and the 1935 version of a christmas carol.the color version is the same one used in the previous editions from vci so there is no restoration on the color version and even has the introduction from patrick mcnee from the first editions from vci.the 1935 version is the short version and not a good copy at all.But what you do get is the full frame restoration of the 1951 classic on the first disc which is the reason to upgrade this gem and the george cole interview is also an added attraction as well as other features.So it has its good and bad,i prefer this upgrade over my two old releases i have.This still deserves a 5 star thus giving us more on this classic in a 2 disc set.\n",
      "In my opinion this is the best of all the classic Christmas tales and this editon is the best telling of this timeless tale.  A true Christmas classic and a great gift idea.\n",
      "Since I was a child, I've watched this rendition of Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol, which is actually entitled Scrooge. As a child, it frightened me more than any horror movie (but I watched horror movies in the 50's and 60's.) When I had children of my own, I shared this version, and others, with them, pointing out that Alistair Sim's portrayal of Scrooge was by far the most superior, in that his metamorphosis is entirely believable! In addition to Sim's incomparable performance as Scrooge, this version also boasted, in my opinion, the best Tiny Tim (Glyn Dearman) and Robert Crachit (Mervyn Johns), and a very young Patrick MacNee who would reappear years later as the cerebral half of The Avengers! I would whole-heartedly recommend this film to anyone who truly prizes the real meaning of Christmas. While I personally would not share this with very young children, I have viewed it with own children and grandchildren when they were 8+ years of age.\n",
      "In case you're one of the 31 people in the world who haven't seen the Alistair Sim edition of this story:  This is definitely the best-acted version of \"A Christmas Carol\", aka \"Scrooge\".For the rest of the planet, you already know this is a good movie, and the question is whether *this* edition of the movie is worth getting.  This \"50th Anniversary Edition\" claims to be made from the original film, and certainly it seems to be of higher quality than the other versions I've seen on tape or DVD.The \"extras\" on this disc are not much.  But then, I didn't want the extras, I just wanted a clearer version of this classic movie.  This edition delivers that.There is one thing that I don't know if was due to my DVD player, or the DVD itself.  It seems that if you start up the DVD, it will keep playing the movie (over and over again) until you stop it.  For this movie, that behavior could be considered a good thing...\n",
      "My wife and I enjoyed this Christmas Carol. If you want a Christmas Carol enjoyment, buy this one.\n",
      "This is the definitive version of the Dickens classic \" A Christmas Carol\" !! My family and I enjoy watching it every year.\n",
      "This is a great old time favorite and works well.  I would suggest this to anyone.\n",
      "Always the best A Christmas Carol and Blu Ray is even better. We also enjoyed the extra disc for our regular DVD.\n",
      "I had been looking for this for a while I truly enjoy the classic. the family all get together and watch it\n",
      "The best without questions version of \"A Christmas Carol\" ever produced. A must see every Christmas Eve.\n",
      "A Christmas Carol with Alistair Sim has been watched by myself and now my family every holiday season for as long as I can remember.I rate this version side by side with the 1984 George C. Scott version.  Each has its charms and idiosynchrasis.The Ghost of Jacob Marley in the 1951 edition is superbly done with many of the original Dicken's lines used or paraphrased.  However the 1984 Ghost was even better, particularly, in my opinion, when he says\" Man of the worldly mind do you beleive in me or not?\"The character of Scrooge himself is portrayed admirably by both Sim and Scott although Scott plays him more arrogantly it seems and therefore more lifelike.  I love his \"arguing\" with the spirits who \"sometimes even (I) forget the rules, after all I don't come around that often.\" ( Ghost of Christmas Present)The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is done the best in the 1951 edition.  Note if you look carefuly at the scene with Scrooge at the window of the Crathcits you can actually see the face of the actor behind the black guaze.The Ghost in the 1984 was perhaps more frightening but that screeching sound he made when he moved and the lightning flashed when the scene changed were annoying.\n",
      "I own 5 different Versions of 'Christmas Carol' and this is the best version ever made. Alastair Sims is the best Scrooge since Dickens wrote it.\n",
      "The 1951 version of Scrooge is the best ever. Digitally enhanced makes it even better. I have the black & White and Colorized versions. Great\n",
      "Considered to be one of the best adaptions of the classic tale and I couldn't agree more. This is our Christmas Eve/Christmas Night video every year.\n",
      "The movie was great. The only problem I had is that when I received it the first time the inside of the cover was crushed up pretty badly. I had to send it back. The second one I received was in great shape.\n",
      "No DVD library is complete without this movie.  It is a Christmas classic and highly recommended for every family. Don't pass it off.\n",
      "Actually not the original version.  The original wasREGINAL OWENS IN 1938,  but a good version.Reginal's version is my favorite, but,  is only availablein VHS at the moment.\n",
      "My favorite of the old Christmas movies. The timeless story of Scrooge and his redemption to being a loving and caring man for as long as he lived.\n",
      "The 1951 version should have been the last.  This is a Christian classic.  The theme and message Dicken's expresses are the true meaning of the holiday, caring for and loving one another.  Sims acting is superb, the  dialogue is \" Dickens \"and each character is potrayed by people  who love theather.  These actors are exceptional.  Scrooge's maid, shown  announcing Marley's death, selling Scrooge's belongings and recieving a  gift from Scrooge, shows a range that not many actors are asked to today.  When Scrooge realizes that \"The spirits have done it all in one  night\" and he starts dancing, you can not help but to get happy as  well.  This movie reminds us that Christmas is not about presents and  shopping.\n",
      "Undeniably the best version of A Christmas Carol ever produced.  Alastair Sim is delightful as Scrooge and the whole cast is wonderful.  A hidden surprise is that a young Patrick Macnee plays young Jacob Marley.  Macnee is better known as John Steed from the Avengers TV series.\n",
      "As a big fan of this Charles Dickens classic, I have seen virtually every film version.  Without question, this is the best of the lot.  Alastair Sim as Scrooge gives one of the most memorable acting performances on film.  Every character, no matter how small, is played by an English character  actor.  It's hard to imagine how the acting could be improved upon--it's  that good. And although it was filmed in 1951, the use of black and white  and the high quality of the photography and scenery make it easy to believe  you are seeing Victorian London (avoid the colorized version).  This film is  underrated despite its well-deserved fame.\n",
      "Of the countless versions of this classic tale, this is the quintessential production that will immortalise Alistaire Sim and the extremely talented cast of character actors forever. Sim's version of the converted and enlightened Scrooge is truly magical! (Note: look for the cameraman in the mirror on two unguarded moments.)This DVD with the original black and white version as well as the sensitively colored version is a must have for all who love Christmas. Where it strays from Dickens' original tale, it actually enhances and improves the story and your enjoyment of it. (i.e. The role of Mrs. Dilber)Long may Dickens' immeasurable talent be celebrated, and Sim, et al, be remembered fondly and with deepest thanks for adding this memorable item to our collective nostalgic experience.de Vere\n",
      "I think Alastair Sim is one of the spookiest Scrooges around but he really makes the role come alive. A very good interpretation of \"A Christmas Carol\"\n",
      "I have always liked this movie and I wanted it on DVD. The package was good and the movie was, of course, great. I really don't believe any other movie version beats this one. I recently purchased the version with Patrick Stewart playing Scrooge, and I have to say it was really good, but I always like the classic the best.\n",
      "This was a bonus package, so not only did I get \"Scrooge\" It came in 2 DVDs on Black & White, and one Color. I felt like I was seeing for the first time as I had never seen it in color before. But, also with the set, a real old movie by the title \"A Christmas Carol\" was included. I enjoyed watching it, however, the whole cast of \"Scrooge\" is second to none. Well worth (what little) money I was charged and fast shipping to boot. 5+STARS!\n",
      "As with all of the famous Christmas movies this time of year, makes you really appreciate sitting down with your family and enjoying these types of movies.\n",
      "I've watched this movie at least once a year for all my 58 years and it is a Christmas essential. It is the best versions of all the Scrooges and Christmas Carols. Glad to have it on dvd.\n",
      "A MASTERPIECE! Based on the novel by Charles Dickens, and it carries it off well. Scene by scene it is a classic. Scrooge is a miserable old miser, until he is visited by three ghosts on Christmas Eve who take him into the past, present, and possible future to change him back to who he really is underneath all his fear, social isolation, and greed. Heart-warming, tear-jerking, and deeply moving film which rings in the spirit of Christmas like no other film ever made.\n",
      "This is the epitome of \"Christmas Carol\" movies, though the George C. Scott TV version is extremely good. In this DVD, you can see the colorized format also. I bought the colorized edition in VHS format serveral years ago, then went to a video store right after, and came upon a VHS edition of the original BW. The BW tape is worn, so I purchased the two-for-one set DVD to replace both tapes. Colorized movies are my least favorite, but this is a fair job, and you do get both versions and the added [but old] bonus features. If you love the Alistair Sims 1951 movie, the DVD purchase is a no-brainer.\n",
      "SPOILERS FOLLOWFor years, I resisted and criticized this 1951 film of Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol.\"  In my opinion, the movie was a vastly overrated piece of fluff from another era.  I've been watching this film particularly closely this holiday season, and my opinion is definitely changing.  Starring Alastair Sim, Mervyn Johns, and Hermione Baddeley, this is a very creative adaptation.The screenplay by Noel Langley(who handled the same duties in a co-writing capacity with Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf for \"The Wizard of Oz\") is extremely faithful to Charles Dickens while throwing in audacious bursts of originality.  For instance, (SPOILER) I love the expanded roles for both Fezziwig and Jacob Marley.  This is both logical from a storytelling point of view, and a realistic expansion for the characters considering their respective significant impacts on Scrooge's life.Mr. Sim offers a surprisingly understated performance as Ebenezer Scrooge, doing as much with body language as with declarations.  Look at his hand subtly shake with anger and frazzled nerves as he dismisses his nephew Fred from his office.  He intuits that Scrooge may not only be angered by the nephew's invitation, but that it threatens to uncover repressed emotions.Mervyn Johns walks a fine line to give a very credible performance as Bob Cratchit.  He is ultimately extremely good, reading mostly oppposite Sim and Hermione Baddeley, although the ingenious screenplay somewhat expands his role as well.  As solid as the performances are, the expanded screenplay truly vaults this film into the masterpiece category.  I'll give few details truly away in this review, but the screenplay may even represent an improvement over Dickens' plotting for this novel.In closing, I'll say that I grew up adoring the 1984 George C. Scott portrayal of Scrooge, and I still do.  But, my perspective is permanently changing as it relates to this acclaimed 1951 film.  I regard the two films now collectively as being equally definitive, their respective Scrooges products of twin masters who each inherently understand the character.  This movie was and is legendary because every ounce of its runtime expresses creativity at a very high level.  Highly recommended.\n",
      "Best version of A Christmas Carol. Alistair Sim nails the part. It's a must watch in my family every year.\n",
      "This version of Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\" is absolutely superior to all other attempts. Due courtesy to George C. Scott and Mickey Mouse, to name but two renditions that come up lame compared to this classic- but what arrogance to think their slick and silly remakes could stand in for this calssic? The bummer for us all, and I truly mean a real bummer- this wonderful 1951 Alastair Sim version was shot in black and white. Worse, it was shot in BAD black and white. I heard it was actually made for English TV. Adding insult to our cinematic injury, the surviving print doesn't seem to be very good either. Perhaps it was a second or third generation copy that survived from that time? Given all that, however, this version is so spectacular, so real, and so emotionally and spiritually true and authentic, that it still gets aired regularly each Christmas season. It is still thrilling to behold, even in its blurry splendor! Again, compared with this, all other versions are poor shadows. They can even seem annoying! Watching Alastair Sim's Scrooge in the years 2001+ will just have to be one of those profound disappointments of history-- like finding a newly discovered Shakespeare play with some of the pages missing. If this had been a pristine, crystal clear color print, no one would even dare to remake the story. As it is, we can only tsk-tsk at the wannabes, and marvel at the artistic magic that manages to filter through from 1951's bad print to us all in the present day.\n",
      "Very pleased with the item and all it's offerings.  Also had an earlier version of A Christmas Carol on it.  Great collector's item indeed.  Pleased with fast delivery during holiday time.\n",
      "If Bill Murray was movie history's worst Scrooge, and he was, then Alastair Sim was its greatest. The problem with Ebenezer Scrooge is that he is such a great character that actors envitably want to put their interpretation to the fore and leave the Dickensonian essence quietly alone within the pages of A Christmas Carol.Scrooge is a redemptive character not because he was visited by three ghosts and scared straight, but rather because he was a lost soul who found his way home. He was at rock bottom good, but had grown up in a world where kindness and virtue were chump values. Ebenezer's raw ambitition caused him to bury his essential nature deep within him, and he came to believe he was just as the world saw him.Scrooge is a very much the kind of businessman dominates the contemporary Western world...an early day Gordon Gecko. Dickens has plans for him however, and he is made to see who he was, and what he has become.Sim's genius lies in his ability to transform his character. The scene at the offices where the 19th century equivalent of the United Way is illustrative. Told of the needs of the poor, Scrooge asks, \"Why? Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?\" Scrooge supports these institutions through his taxes, and sees no need of doing anything more. What he wants is clear, \"I want to be left alone.\"Because Alastair Sim plays Charles Dickens' Scrooge and not his own and because Brian Desmond Hurst the director saw the bitter social commentary that lay within this fable, this remains the most satisfying film of the classic.Now a few words about the DVD. It comes in several formats...a restored B&W; version, a 16:9 B&W; version, and a colorized version. A bonus of a 1935 version staring Seymour Hicks is included, but not the only other comparably great Scrooge, Reginald Owen from the 1938 edition. The colorized version takes away from Hurst initially dark vision, and is a distraction. The film was originally shot in a 1.33:1 aspect ration, and the 16:9 widescreen would seem ill adapted to it. However it proves to be little distraction on a widescreen monitor.\n",
      "This is my husbands favorite christman movie.  We were blown away with the color version!! Great Job!\n",
      "Many people believe this Alastair Sim version of A Christmas Carol is the best film adaptation of Dickens's story.  \"Too good to be shown only at Christmas\" is film critic Leonard Maltin's much-quoted judgment.  Released in Britain in 1951 under the title \"Scrooge,\" the film offers fine performances by Sim and a number of other first-rate British actors of the time. The most recognizable of these other actors to modern American audiences is probably Peter Bull, who went to play many film roles, including that of the Russian ambassador in Dr. Strangelove.  Bull narrates the film and has a small role as a business colleague of Scrooge's.  The production values -- including the special effects involving Jacob Marley's ghost and the spirits -- are fine, especially for a 1951 film.  Overall, though, I still think the television version starring George C. Scott is the definitive filming of this story.  That version benefits from being in color, with better effects, and a terrific performance by Scott. Interestingly, Clive Donner, who was the editor on this film, directed the Scott version.This Blu-ray edition is an improvement on the versions previously available and is certainly much better than the prints typically shown on television.  I found it crisp and clean, although a few times some of the faces were a bit washed out -- a fairly common occurrence, I think, in Blu-ray versions of older black and white films.  In addition, there were several times where there was bit of blurring when one of the actors moved rapidly.  I don't know whether this was a fault of the transfer or of my Blu-ray player, although I can't recall experiencing it with other films I've viewed on this player.  Leonard Maltin provides an interesting introduction, which puts the film in historical context and offers brief comparisons to other versions.  A British cultural historian offers commentary on various aspects of the film, and an American film distributor discusses attempts to distribute the film in the United States.  Apparently, the film was considered too dark to be promoted as a family film and ended up receiving only a limited release in the United States.If you haven't seen this film, you definitely should.  If you are familiar with it, but don't own a copy, this is the version to buy.\n",
      "I watch this version every year and purchased this for a family member.  The acting is superb and no other copy compares with it.\n",
      "If I remember correctly this was not the only production of Dickens classic with Alastair Simm as Scrooge. This was a very good film but not as good as the version I think I remember. In either case Alastair Simm is a wonderful Scrooge.....the best portrayal of Scrooge I have ever seen.He makes the film memorable.  Harvey L.\n",
      "We had been looking for a copy of the Alastair Sim movie for quite a while as our video tape was sooo stretched! And what a wonderful copy this is.Glorious movie - excellent direction, production values and acting.Superb extra features courtesy of the multi-talented Tom Weaver and Marcus Hearn, both very knowledgeable about the genre.A wonderful addition to our collection, with the original ratio version (a thing my husband relishes) and a colourised version which is an interesting variation and the perfect time of year to acquire it.Couldnt ask for more.Merry Christmas Amazon!\n",
      "\"Old Marley was as dead as a doornail. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I'm going to relate.\"And so begins A CHRISTMAS CAROL, an atmospheric tale of morality and ghosts. It's a bit weird viewing this film when it's not even Christmas yet; it seems near sacrilegious somehow. But there's no denying its quality and longevity. It's a movie for the ages and the definitive version of Charles Dicken's enduring holiday fable. Wait - I wasn't the first to say this? Cor!Nevertheless, bulgy-eyed and crooked-of-teeth Scottish actor Alistair Sim, with this celebrated performance, attains cinematic immortality even as he exiles onto a lower tier all other portrayals of Ebenezer Scrooge. Other adaptations boast the likes of George C. Scott, Patrick Stewart, Albert Finney, Michael Caine, and even Bill Murray. Sim leaves them in his dust, their heads hanging low. Sim invests his character with such an aura of petty vitriol and resolute bitterness. Scrooge's treatment of his fellow men couldn't be more coldhearted and dismissive. That we speedily come to long for such a soured man to discover penitence and thus regain his soul is a nod to Sim's acting.Assuming that everyone knows the story, this then is the briefest of recaps: Old miserly sinner Ebenezer Scrooge starts out by gruffly proclaiming \"And Christmas, sir, is a humbug!\" But, after four unsettling haunts are visited upon him - in which moments he is shown the horrific tapestry that was/is/and will be his life - he remorsefully declares, \"I'm not the man I was.\" And then, in an exhibition of spontaneous glee, he stands on his head. As an astounded little boy, I had marked that scene as the clear turning point which indicated that the codgery reprobate had indeed reformed. The transformation of Ebenezer from despicable humbug to merry Uncle Scrooge is a startling thing, and Sim pulls it off with aplomb.Suffice to say, this 1951 version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL (a film that's sometimes called SCROOGE), along with other classic holiday fare such asIt's a Wonderful Life (60th Anniversary Edition),Miracle on 34th Street (Special Edition), andHoliday Inn (Special Edition), is a must-see in my household come each December. But Alistair Sim is not the sole reason to see this piece of celluloid; his is not the only brilliance manifested here. The rest of the cast perform remarkably. Pile on to the superlative acting the wonderful adaptation with its delicious supernatural elements, the moody, nerve-jangling score, the elegant, beautifully remastered black and white cinematography (delightfully evoking Victorian England), and the excellent pacing of the film...and, well, all these factors combine to make this picture an essential and unforgettable movie experience.Let's get into the bonus stuff. A CHRISTMAS CAROL: THE ULTIMATE COLLECTOR'S EDITION is a lush and handsome 2-disc dvd product. Disc 1 offers restored B & W versions of this film in two specs (in the original 4 x 3 and also in 16 x 9, enhanced for widescreen monitors), along with film commentary by Marcus Hearn and actor George Cole, who both provide insights and reminiscences. Extras feature subtitle options in English or Spanish, audio options including an English narrative for the blind (very cool, and also applies to Disc 2), and cast bios.Going to Disc 2, we can opt for the same A CHRISTMAS CAROL, but in color, or the solid 1935 version with Seymour Hicks as Scrooge. Further extras include trailers for SCROOGE and A CHRISTMAS CAROL (both the same movies). Video featurettes are \"Spirit of Christmas Past\" - 15 minutes of Marcus Hearn interviewing actor George Cole, who played Scrooge as a young man in the 1951 version; \"Richard Gordon Remembers George Minter and Renown Pictures\" - a 20 minute interview with Richard Gordon, who helped to fund and distribute the film; \"Charles Dickens - His Life and Times\"; \"Before and After Restoration\"; and a photo gallery. But, while I dug the various permutations in format of the 1951 film (the original, the widescreen, the colored) and even thought the 1935 movie interesting, I couldn't get into the featurettes, finding the interviews a bit too stodgy and dry. Doubtless, others will find them interesting enough.Alistair Sim was a great character actor who made other noteworthy films. It's just that he was so good in A CHRISTMAS CAROL that this role now overshadows his other works. But if you liked what you saw here and are curious to see more of Alistair Sim, I definitely recommend the excellent wartime thrillerGreen for Danger - Criterion Collection, Hitchcock'sStage Fright, and the comedy The Belles Of St. Trinian's (wherein Sim is part time in drag).\n",
      "I have been searching a long time for this particular Carol. I am so glad I was able to find it on Amazon!  The movie was in perfect condition and the shipping was great too!  Though the cover is color, it is played in black and white, but that's alright by me.  Thank you for your service!\n",
      "A Christmas CarolGreat quality! Delivered on time. Very satisfied .This version is the very best one of the whole series\n",
      "I believe this is one DVD everybody should enjoy during Christmas season. It is heart-warming, educational, not to mention a Charles Dickens' masterpiece classic. I can watch this movie over and over again, as if I'm watching it for the first time. H.K. Mack.\n",
      "Let me echo the chorus of praise for this version of Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\".  A thousand years from now, people will still be rightly hailing Alistair Sim's performance as Scrooge as THE definitive portrayal.  Look for performances by Patrick Macnee (as Young Marley), Peter Bull (\"Dr. Strangelove\"), and Hermione Baddeley (\"Mary Poppins\").Funny stuff to watch for:--- Patrick Macnee's opening and closing.  It seems as though Patrick was hitting the cognac a little hard between takes!  Look at his eyes and listen to him speak - I swear he's got half a bag on!--- The Morning After - As Scrooge dances around his bedroom in the presence of the maid, look closely as he goes to the mirror.  There appears to be another presence in his \"room\", the Ghost of Renown Pictures Corp. Ltd., complete with suit & tie!\n",
      "The mean miser in all of London Ebenezer Scroge was transformed by the spirit of Yuletide in a real human being . Powerful anecdotic tale of Charles Dickens .A gratifying entertainment familiar.\n",
      "There are two superb film adaptations of this Dickens classic; this one and the 1984 TV film starring George C. Scott.  Both do justice to the original novella far beyond any other dramatizations.  However, it is this 1951 British version that got there first and no doubt inspired the 1984 remake.  Both Alastair Sim and Scott breath life into the character of Scrooge and make him a three-dimensional personality whose life and fate take on far greater meaning than they do in the hands of other actors who have taken on this role.  Sim, of course, became the definitive Scrooge by first taking the character seriously and by portraying Scrooge as more than a simplistic cardboard cutout.  For those of us who were raised on this version of the film, Sim will always \"be\" Scrooge.  That does not detract from Scott's performance at all and he was quoted as saying he knew from the start that he could never hope to match Sim's effort. Nonetheless, he succeeded in carving out his own highly credible, compelling portrait of Scrooge which stands beside that of Sim's, like two magnificent paintings sharing the same wall.  Both films should be enjoyed and appreciated as the fine, individual achievements that they are and both will stand as \"definitive\" for a very, very long time.  We are the richer for having such a marvelous choice.\n",
      "I Always enjoyed this fine original Scrooge film. Alister Simms IS AWESOME. I haven't seen this version in a long time. I love it.\n",
      "A classic that my family and I love.  No other Scrooge movie compares.  I love this 1952 classic.  It's our family go to movie and has been for years.  One of the reasons I love it so much, is you really do feel like you are in the 1800's, unlike the other Scrooge's.  I just never got into Spock or the guy from Star Trek being Scrooge, ya know?!!\n",
      "This version of A Christmas Carol has been our favorite for many years and is still the best.The DVD's quality is a major step up from our old VHS tape. An excellent restoration and the bonus feature is, well . . . a bonus.\n",
      "This movie gets you in the mood for Christmas!  So fun to watch the journey through time as depicted!  Great acting in the old fashioned way which was nice! A very emotional study of Mr. Scrooge!  A must see!\n",
      "VCI Entertainment presents the ULTIMATE 2-disc Collector's Edition of the definitive motion picture adaptation of Charles Dickens' yuletide classic, A Christmas Carol (known in England as \"Scrooge\").  The set comes wrapped in a lovely cardboard slipcover, lavishly decorated with screenshots from the film, and adorned with sparkly, three dimensional snowflakes.  Inside is a clear, double keepcase that opens to reveal a festive winter scene behind the discs.Disc 1 includes two versions of the film: the standard 4x3 version, and a 16x9 version for widescreen TVs.  Both have been painstakingly restored by Point 360, so they look and sound spectacular...for a movie that was made in 1951.  There's also a full-length commentary with Marcus Hearn and George Cole (who played the young Ebenezer Scrooge); as well as brief, written biographies of Alastair Sim; Kathleen Harrison; Jack Warner; Brian Desmond Hurst; Mervyn Johns; and Hermione Baddeley.Disc 2 contains the very undesirable (and ugly) computer colorized version, with an introduction by Patrick MacNee (the young Jacob Marley), which includes the option of a descriptive audio track for the blind.  But wait!  There's MORE!  VCI has also thrown in, at no extra charge, the 1935 adaptation of Scrooge, directed by Henry Edwards and starring Sir Seymour Hicks.  Plus, you get a veritable cornucopia of special features, such as: two movie trailers; a photo gallery with a TON of Christmas Carol pictures; a before and after restoration comparison; an interview with George Cole (which is mostly redundant if you've listened to the commentary on disc 1); a six-minute biography of Charles Dickens; and an interview with Richard Gordon (who helped get A Christmas Carol distributed in the United States), where you'll learn all about producer George Minter and his Renown Pictures.I think what really makes the 1951 version of A Christmas Carol stand out as the best is the powerful and moving way in which Alastair Sim portrays Scrooge's joyous transformation from a coldhearted miser to a cheerful giver.  It should serve as a reminder to all of us to be kind and generous to one another, not just at Christmastime, but all the time.  It should also serve as a reminder to always brush your teeth after consuming those holiday goodies, or else you might wind up with teeth like Mr. Scrooge's.  Also, please do not allow your children to hold and caress a raw, unfrozen turkey carcass, as the Cratchit children do in this film, or else they might wind up contracting salmonella...or worse, campylobacter!Now nip along smartly and place your order while the pudding is still singing in the copper, `cause this merry DVD set is as good as gold and better!  Bob's your uncle!Also recommended:A Christmas Carol, andMr. Magoo's Christmas Carol\n",
      "\"This is an excellent format.  Exactly as I wanted.  This version is the classic to have.  This movie can and should be watched often.  Not just at Christmas.\n",
      "Yes, there are many arguments on who made the best CC - but this is the one. It's certainly the most frightening.\n",
      "This 1951 version of A Christmas Carol, with Alistair Sim, is the absolute best. We have had the movie on VCR and decided we should buy the DVD version.  This Collector's Edition gave us several bonus features we had never seen before, some of which were very interesting.\n",
      "This is the one and only Christmas Carol you need to watch. It sticks to the original story by Dickens which is the best Christmas story ever told bar none. You will be saying God Bless us Everyone by the end of the movie, and isn't that what the season is about\n",
      "Over the decades there have been many screen adaptations of this timeless classic by Charles Dickens. The story is sometimes acted out with levity, as in \"Black Adder's Christmas Carol\" and Michael Caine's excellent 1992 production \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\", et al. When reviewing Alastair Sim's 1951 film I feel it's more appropriate to restrict my comparisons to the other 'serious' adaptations as well as to the original novel.The 1984 George C. Scott production boasts some excellent acting but leaves out much of the storyline. The exact reverse is true of the 1999 Patrick Stuart version, where more of the original story is retained but Stuart is unconvincing as Scrooge. Overall, this 1951 Alastair Sim adaptation is the best I've seen yet - especially since it was 'colourised' in 1979. In fact, this DVD boxed-set contains both! It also includes a pretty dated 1936 effort called \"Scrooge\", starring Seymour Hicks. Cinema made enormous strides in those 15 years and Hicks's treatment can't hold a candle to Sim's 1951 classic.There's one aspect of the Alastair Sim version that's worthy of mention. Scenes and dialogue not found in the original text are inserted in order to \"flesh out\" the story. In some cases, this can actually enhance the viewing experience (and I say that as something of a literary purist). For example, there's a scene where Scrooge & Marley - both aged thirty-something - offer to pay their employer's debts from personal savings. This is in exchange for an option to buy up 51% of the company's shares. Dickens's novel contained no such narrative, yet the scene helps to paint a picture of the partners' gradual descent from the benignity of honest ambition into the malignancy of personal greed.But often with a classic novel, when you add something to it you take away. This is especially true of the farcical scene where Jacob Marley appears to be repenting on his death-bed. The fact that Marley died unrepentant is crucial to the storyline! A poor piece of directing in my view.Overall, I still highly recommend this video. Were it not for the Marley death-bed anomaly I'd have awarded it the full 5 stars.\n",
      "This version emotionally takes you back to the time and spirit of Dickens.  You will need to look out the window every once in a while to make sure you have not been time transported to 160 years ago.  It is very close to the original manuscript which I read once per year just before  Christmas as well as viewing this version of the video.\n",
      "I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my husband, who is a real aficionado of the various \"Christmas Carol\" versions. We were both very impressed with the high quality video and outstanding audio. I had only seen this version on TV, so it was a real treat to see the complete uncut version. The additional commentary and bonus features added to our appreciation of the film. And it was a very good price, too!\n",
      "I love this movie in its original black and white.  My opinion, without doubt, the best of all the filmed CHRISTMAS CAROLS.  Alastair Sim is the Scrooge for the ages.  So the question is, does colorization make this film better or improve it in any way? The answer is no.  It can't be improved because it's already perfect. But colorization certainly does add an element of fun in watching it after repeated b&w; viewings.  And if colorization gets younger viewers to watch this wonderful movie, than it's more than a gimmick.  It's a tool to encourage those not familiar with the film classics to give them a look.As far as the actual colorization goes, I really don't see much improvement in the process in all the years it's been around.  Having said that, this film sort of lends itself to the process however because of the locale and nature of the storytelling so the faded, less than crisp colors don't detract from the picture and can almost seem like they might belong.  More important than the colorization, is the added feature in this package of the widescreen presentation of the black and white version which looks terrific!So if you are a fan of the movie and would like to see what it looks like colorized (and I admit I always do like to see the colorization of the classics just for the fun of it) or even if you would like to see the b&w; version in widescreem (I'm really not sure how they achieved this cause it wasn't filmed in widescreen but looks here like it really was:  no distortion or zoom-like cutoffs at all!) or if you are a collector of anything A CHRISTMAS CAROL, then I happily recommend this version to you.  Happy Holidays!PS:  For us collectors of A CHRISTMAS CAROL, this packaging is pretty nifty, too!\n",
      "Anyone who has been exposed to the Alastair Sim's  \"A Christmas Carol\" needs no convincing of the above. Perhaps there are some who remember Mr. Magoo's version with fondness or are partial to the '70s musical, but once per celluloid ounce Sim's is the hand's down winner.\n",
      "No problems. Prompt delivery. Product in good condition. Black and white amazingly clear, a beautiful picture, better even than the colorized version. It's nice to have both.\n",
      "What an awesome collection! The quality and clarity of the pictures was AMAZING!! We bought this to replace our original video VHS tape, which we had watched for so many years as a Christmas tradition. We had worn that one out & it broke! We could not believe the difference in the sharpness & brightness - how amazing and beautiful the colors appeared, compared to our other version.  WHAT A TREAT! It was great to view all the background interviews & information too. We always anticipate seeing this wonderful old film every Christmas: (the 1951 version with Alastair Sim - the other versions are not as true to the original Dicken's novel). We almost don't want to wait another whole year to see it again now that we have such a wonderful, quality version.The first time I saw this movie was when I was very young & it scared me a lot because of some of the content - but as I grew older & viewed it over again each year, I began to see it with \"new\" eyes. Now I am blessed again each year & reminded of the deeper message in it about the true Christmas Spirit - and what mine should be. As the Spirit of Christmas present states in the film - \"The Christ child does not live in our hearts but one day a year, but 365.\"  Like New Year's resolution's - I don't always retain or do what I resolve to do. However, I was able to find a very unique plaque that I keep on my living room wall - in full view, all year long - that say's \"God Bless Us Everyone\"  I love it!  And I really love this DVD Collection!\n",
      "Let me preface this article with a comment. Of all the versions of \"Scrooge\" I've seen, my favorite is the 1951 version starring Alastair Sim in the title role.  And regardless of what I'm about to say, I'll continue to watch AND enjoy the film for many years to come. However, this favoritism is qualified. The film is not without error. One of the prominent errors was a production error occurring near the end of the film. On Christmas morning, one of the first things Scrooge does is look into his wall mirror. And in that mirror you can see Scrooge's reflection, a reflection of the curtains behind him, and (grin) the reflection of either a stagehand or cameraman peeking out from behind one of those curtains.But, as embarassing as that error may have been, it isn't the worst error made in the film.To someone who has only seen the film, the error may not be readily apparent. But if you, like me, first read Dickens' novel, \"A Christmas Carol,\" upon which the film is based, you'll be left scratching your head.In the novel, the death of Scrooge's mother is only implied. And there is no hint as to the circumstances surrounding her death. And in the novel, the death of Scrooge's sister, Fan, is mentioned as being when she was an adult. But again, there is no hint as to the circumstances surrounding her death. The novel leads us to believe, therefore, that the distancing between Scrooge's father and Scrooge (and between Scrooge and his nephew, Fred) is merely because both were miserly unfeeling men. But in the screenplay written by Noel Langley, he introduces \"death during childbirth\" as the reason behind the deaths of both Scrooge's mother and Fan ... and uses this fact as the reason for Scrooge's father distancing himself from Scrooge and, later, for Scrooge distancing himself from Fred (Fan's child).The problem?In the novel, Dickens refers to Fan as being much younger than Ebenezer. Ebenezer being older than Fan is also implied (but never spoken of) in the film. But, if Fan was younger than Ebenezer and if their mother died during Ebenezer's birth, Fan couldn't exist. Their mother would have already been dead and buried by the time Fan should have been born.Langley made other revisions to Dickens' novel but this is the only one that backfired into a character error. But, it was an avoidable error if only Langley had used a different cause of death (and not been specific about the dates). While death during childbirth was common in Dickens' time, it was not as common as death by consumption (now referred to as tuberculosis). Dickens' own younger sister died from the disease. Her name was Fan.\n",
      "There is non better then Alistair Sim for the part of Scrooge.  We watch it every year and enjoy same.\n",
      "This is a real value and an enduring motion picture. Alastir Sim palys a fabulous part of Scrooge. The black and white film is cleaned up,clear and great sound. A perfect movie to share with family each and every year!\n",
      "Now I don't have to wait for it to be on TV and the image is very good. Now I can watch it with my grand kids anytime too.\n",
      "Alistair Sim is the quintessential Scrooge.  Give me the black and white version in preference to the colorized one, as the use of light and shadow in the original is fabulous.  We watch it every year.\n",
      "Mr Sim is simply the greatest of all film Scrooges. No one can match his expressiveness. The movie itself is a healthy corrective to the vulgarity of Scrooged, but then it comes from a more spiritual time and place.\n",
      "I have watched no less than 6 different versions of A Christmas Carol.  However, I always keep coming back to this version starring Alistar Sim.  His portrayal of Scrooge is magnificant.  This is a classic.  I highly recommend this version.  You won't be disappointed.\n",
      "Perhaps this Christmas story is the most famous non-biblical one of all, written by one of the great authors in a poignant, heart rending tale guaranteed to entice your heart to overflowing.The movie does the story justice, the actors seem born to their roles.I love this story, and our family finds a reason to watch this movie every year.  And what a joyous feast we have after we view it.\n",
      "The best of the Christmas Carol movies. One of the best movies ever. Black and white better than color. This movie shows how the Spirit of Christmas changed a misanthrope into a benevolent Christian. He suffered, he became enlightened, he repented, and then was sanctified. He stopped thinking about himself and began to think about others.\n",
      "The 1951 British film stars Alastair Sim as \"Scrooge\".  Sometimes a black & white film is really good for effect.  But the print of the film is so bad, it might be best to see a computer-colorized version.  I originally saw this version of Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\" in its black & white form and it scared the dickens out of me.  So this review is for the colorized version.  Excellent performance as \"Jacob the Ghost\" from Michael Hordern.  Patrick Macnee plays \"Young Jacob Marley\".  Hermione Baddeley (Mary Poppins [1964] and the CBS tv series \"Maude\" in 1974-77]) plays \"Mrs. Cratchit\".  I can't say this is the best version and probably young children will not like this one.The computer-colorized version is a process that was used in the 1980's to add some color to an original black & white film.  it may not be a true color of a dress worn, but it does give the movie more depth and brings out many things you did not see in the original b&w; version.  This computer-colorized version is more rich in color than previous processes.At end of film, it says \"The End\" \"Scrooge\".  \"Scrooge\" was the original title of this British film.  The British also did this version of \"Scrooge\" in 1935 with Sir Seymour Hicks and in 1970 with Albert Finney as \"Scrooge\".\n",
      "Great version of \"The Christmas Carol\"-I thought the colorization was great!  Must have if you like classic holiday movies.  Classic!\n",
      "Everyone knows the story as this has been around for years, but to settle down with the family and some warm hot chocolate on a cold winter's night all snuggly on the couch and watch this movie....a  self centered penny pinching miser is converted to an outgoing and loving man...Just classic!\n",
      "This holiday classic has been long overdue for quality remastering. The 1951 film is often hailed by critics as the best of many screen adaptations of Dickens' beloved tale, with Alastair Sim - for whom the film was created - the perfect Scrooge. The black-and-white image is excellent, if a bit grainy in some scenes. There are no major extras - most of the talent associated with the film has been dead a long time - but the set does come with an extra disc with standard DVD of the film. If it's a color version (with music) you'd enjoy, try \"Scrooge!\" with Albert Finney as Scrooge.\n",
      "Alastair Sim totally nails the part in everyway. His acting is superb as well as his \"interpretation\" of Ebenezer Scrooge. Highly recommended. Blu-Ray disc is worth the extra expense!\n",
      "In my opinion this is the best version of this movie. My family had never seen this version before and in fact were watching it only because I was telling them how great it is. The movie won them over and we have now added it to our must watch Christmas movie list every year.-Jim\n",
      "My wife and I believe that \"A Christmas Carol\" is one of the most important stories every written, not only for the holiday season but for all times during the year.  We recently watched all nine versions we have accumulated through the past 20+ years. These include the ones with Seymour Hicks in 1935, to Patrick Stewart in 1999.  This 1951 production, starring Alistair Sim, is the best.  What we like about it most is how Scrooge is depicted after he's visited by the three Christmas spirits.  He is totally transformed.  He shows unbridled joy in being released from bondage to greed and contempt for his fellow man.  This depiction is unmatched by the other versions.  The colorized form of the movie is outstanding and adds a good bit to the story-telling.  If anyone wants this Dickens classic in its finest incarnation, this is the DVD to get.\n",
      "I love this production of \"A Christmas Carol.\"  I purchased it to share with my son and his family, so it can be part of their Christmas tradition as well.\n",
      "This particular version is better than any one out there.  You can't improve on the original.  Just gotta love it.\n",
      "This wonderful old black and white version of the classic story is one of my all time favorite films! As a matter of fact, I think it may be my Number One Favorite Film! No matter how many times I have seen it I never get tired of it, and it is a movie that can be enjoyed any time of the year, not just Christmas time! This version, with Alastair Sim, is the Only truly worthwhile version, in my opinion! It's ending never fails to move me to tears, it is so heartwarming...and I've seen that movie over and over snce childhood...I am a senior now. Next to the ending, my second favorite moment is when Scrooge enters the ballroom during his nephew's party and the song \"Barbara Allen\" is playing, and everyone is dancing in those beautiful gowns and formal suits. Wonderful stuff! This DVD also has clips of two silent films as well...a much earlier Scrooge, (really weird,) and a clip from Bleak House.  You will enjoy this DVD!\n",
      "My family loves this version of the Dickens story.  We watch it every year on Christmas Eve.  No one even comes close to Alastair Sim's portrayal.\n",
      "This item was received in a timely fashion & it was a gift to my son.  this is by far the best film of Xmas Carol & especially so in ble-ray.Janette Todd\n",
      "Disregard the colorized version of this DVD, and watch the original version in B&W.; This is a movie that so impacted my thinking as a child that it effected the way I dealt with people in business my entire adult life.A soft-hearted boy is turned into a miserly, joyless tightwad. His character is so well-defined that the name Scrooge has come to be the very definition of miserable cheapness.Ahhhh, but it is the transformation that brings new life to this Scrooge without a soul, and brings a symbolic new birth at Christmas!This is a timeless story to be cherished.\n",
      "I have owned practically all of the VHS and DVD versions of this movie.  Alastiar Sim gives an over-the-top performance as Scrooge.  As wild as it is, it resonates with audiences and the true spirit of Dickens.  This Blu-ray disc does not contain the 80s colorized version of the movie.  There are new special features, including an interview with one of the production staff members.  This restoration is worth the price of purchasing a Blu-ray player... for just one movie.\n",
      "This is easily the best movie adaptation of Dickens' little novel.Alastair Sim doesn't make his Scrooge into an object of curiosity or amusement. His character has soured on life's promises of affection and he uses that insight to help us believe in the character's journey from a sensitive young man to a bitter old one.Sure, it's great fun to take in how eloquently he voices his cynicism. But this Scrooge has real depth and that's what turns him from a cardboard character into a representative for anyone whose dreams have ever been dashed by a cold and heartless world. As the spirits take him back over that road to disillusionment, we see - as does Scrooge - how much he sacrificed when he gave up his hope in humanity.Sim makes that journey believable and meaningful; he breathes real life into the character so that we can't help but feel his pain and see in him some of our own. His transformation is measured, convincing and, finally, deeply moving.A great supporting cast rounds out the movie. Most notably, Kathleen Harrison, Scooge's charwoman, balances comic delivery with the emotion that let's us see how the coldness of one man hardens those around him. And, conversely, his conversion spreads warmth and light through her as well.Yes, the movie takes some liberties with the novel, but that's to be expected when you transplant a story from one medium and era to others. And this restoration is good, so good that the few shots that seem beyond repair stick out a bit painfully.Watch it and have a good cry. Hope, redemption and the persistent possibility of a little bit of good in everybody: isn't that what Christmas is all about?\n",
      "This is by far the best Carol that has been made. Alastair Sim is unbelievable as Scrooge. He plays the role with a passion that you have to see to believe. DO NOT PASS THIS UP! The blu-ray picture is stunning. Watch the trailer that is included at a special feature and then watch the feature, you will see the difference. I am a purist that believes this movie was, is and forever will be best in black and white. You won't miss the color feature like previous releases had. From the remastered picture to the all new special features this is a solid 5 stars +.Also you will enjoy the silent film special feature presentation. I was very enjoyable to watch and see the differences from silent film  to talkies.\n",
      "The Alistair Sim version and the George C. Scott version are tied as the best version in my opinion!!!\n",
      "Alistair Sim's facial expressions, ranging from bitter to incredulous, make this movie one of the best British comedies of the 1950s period. Sim and the movie-makers never play Scrooge's selfishness for sympathy, making his change of heart all the more moving. Also, this version includes two key scenes left out of most versions - we see Scrooge's sister, the only person who ever cared about him in his childhood years, die giving birth to his nephew Fred and we see Dickesn's social message, those two phantom children, Want and Ignorance, huddled next to the Ghost of Christmes Present. The anniversary DVD contains a detailed discussion of the actors and others involved in the making of this movie - for instance, The Avengers' Patrick MacNee plays the young Jacob Marley and Bride of Frankenstein's Ernest Thesiger (Dr. Praetorius) plays the undertaker. \"Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?\" Is there no better version of this timeless story? I don't think there is.\n",
      "Very good adaptation on film for of this classic book written by Ch. Dickens but I think there are more adaptations much better as release.\n",
      "There are a lot of good Christmas Carol movies out there, but this 1951 version has to be the best.  Alastair Sim provides the best acting of Scrooge period.  Unlike other actors, Sim showed the most dramatic change as miserly Scrooge became the \"as good a man the ever town knew\".  Another good thing is that this version provides a clever way of showing how the young Scrooge changed into his miserly condition.  It may not be part of the book, but we see Fred's birth, how Scrooge met Marley, and how Scrooge got so rich.  All of the actors did a fine job in this great (and in my opinion) the best Christmas Carol.\n",
      "Classic Christmas Story - In this version the characters have full and rich dialogs embellishing the purpose and moral of the tale.\n",
      "I first saw this movie, starring the incredible Alistair Sim as Scrooge(the real title of the film), at school back in the fifties. We were ushered into the school gym and the projector was run for all of the children in my rather small school. I was entranced with the story. We owned a copy of the book at home, with the original illustrations, and it is remarkable either way. When you have Charles Dickens as the author, chances are you are going to get a classic tale which is honestly great.I find this movie, which I have viewed countless times, honestly great as well. I believe that it is all too true that people need to be taught at times how to behave toward other people: when Scrooge gets a second chance to become a good man and live the spirt of Christmas every day of the year after his visitations (from Jacob Marley, and the three spirits: Past, Present, and Future) it is incredibly affecting.I particularly found the visitation of Christmas Past interesting to watch, as an adult. I suppose I understand now why Scrooge became the man he became. No excuses, but it is a realization I didn't have when I first watched this film growing up. It is an excellent explanation of why a person would become cold and bitter and unfeeling.Alistair Sim's face is an extraordinary one. He sort of looks like a beagle. But when he is angry or mean, he is fearful looking. There are many things in this movie which are genuinely fearful, or sad, or moving.That is part of what makes it a great classic.True emotions evoked by fantastic directing (Brian Desmond Hurst) and perfect acting (not just by Sim, but also by Mervyn Johns as Bob Crachit, the epitome of a loving devoted father who must work for Scrooge to support his family, which includes, of course, Tiny Tim) make for a film which is worth watching any time of the year, by anyone.I recommend giving this to the person(s) you most love, and watching it together!I love seeing Scrooge go off in the snow at the end with a running, cheerful Tiny Tim, now healed because Scrooge has changed and is helping the Cratchits. It isn't silly, it is lovely. A great, uplifting scene!It is a true delight to have a great movie come so exquisitely and beautifully packaged just in time for the Holidays! It has everything you could want and more!Deck the Halls!\n",
      "Let me make this clear: there is but one worthy film adaptation of Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol,\" and that's the black-and-white version starring Alastair Sim as Ebeneezer Scrooge. Accept no imitations!The Sim version brings Dickens to life like no other. Scrooge's transformation from miserly old curmudgeon to joy-filled philanthropist is handled expertly. And much of Dickens' story is left intact or transformed in a way that is true to the original. The journey through Scrooge's lonely past is heart-wrenching and sad, laying the groundwork for his decisions to harden his heart to love and his fellows' welfare. The scene at the Old Joe's shop, where three characters trade in goods stolen from the dead, is wonderfully rendered and appalling. Though not in the original, the scene with Scrooge's charwoman, in which she fears for her personal safety in the presence of her transformed employer, ties up a loose end in the story and is a masterpiece of comic art.This is truly a wonderful adaptation. The emotions are right on the surface, and there is no post-modern self-referential nonsense to get in the way of the message. Dickens' dialog is showcased extensively. Even the very dated video double-exposure techniques seem to fit. \"A Christmas Carol\" is a masterwork that can be watched over and over. And its message (\"The welfare of mankind was your business!\") can stand to be heard over and over as well!\n",
      "This is one of my favorite Christmas movies! I could watch it over and over again. I recommend this movie.\n",
      "I love this movies as I truly think this is the best \"A Christmas Carol\" filmed! It brings back memories of my childhood.\n",
      "This is the best movie version of \"A Christmas Carol\" period. Alastair Sim is fantastic. The whole scene where he wakes up on Christmas day as a transformed man is an amazing piece of acting. The rest of the cast is very good. The sets and costumes are very good. Scrooge's house is perfect. The writers and director took some liberties with the script, but the movie definitely remains true to the spirit of the book. The George C. Scott version is very good, but I think Sim's performance puts this one ahead by a long stretch.The extra features are good, but not great. I haven't tried the interviews yet so I might change my mind. The bio of Alistair Sim is very standard fare. The 1935 version is very dark and grainy version and it is a version that I don't like. The colorized version is a bad colorized version with the great Patrick Mac Nee giving the introduction. However, Mac Nee is very good in the introduction. The restoration of the black and white film is very good. Some frames seem a little fuzzy, but the fuzziness only lasts for a split second and the bad frames are very rare. For the most part the movie is clear and crisp. They have two aspect ratios: I tried the 4:3 and it worked well. I tried the audio for the blind and it was pretty good.In summary, I don't know if this is the \"Ultimate\" collector's edition, but it is worth every penny. The extras are good for the most part; however, the collection really delivers on the restored b&w; version.\n",
      "\"A Christmas Carol\"My new DVD version of Dickens's  \"A Christmas Carol\"  shows excellent improvement over the video version. The price is also more than reasonable.  Thanks.\n",
      "My wife is a fanatic for this film. She could not locate her DVD copy purchased a few years back.I bought this for her even after reading the downsides mentioned by some reviewers. I told her about those comments and was curious what she thought.Maybe it could be even better than this version if they started with a better master. However, I noticed that the video is much better even with its flaws. If you need to watch this film around Christmas, this IS the one to get.\n",
      "This is the best Christmas Carol movie...I don't know why anyone tries to re-make it! Evokes all your emotions - casting is perfect, acting superb. The ghosts are particularly well done.  My resident expert on Dickens tells me this is true to the book more than other versions as ghosts other than the past, present, and future are depicted whereas they are missing in other versions. Black & white is best but if your kids need to see color to be interested...you get both here!\n",
      "Watched both versions (color, black & white) at Christmas.  Grandkids liked the color version better but hubby and I enjoy the original B&W.  All of us agree Alastair Sim is SCROOGE.  His grumpiness, his fright, his seeing of the light, his giddiness, his happiness and delight in the end are all infectious.  Nothing gets me into the real \"spirit of Christmas\" as Alastair's portrayal of Ebenezer Scrooge.\n",
      "This is my favorite film version of the Dickens classic. My only complaint about this DVD release is that an edited version of the 1935 version, \"Scrooge\", starring Seymour Hicks is included as an extra, rather than the full version of that film. For some reason an edited version of the 1935 film has circulated in the U.S. for years. The full and uncut version was released on DVD in 2002 by Image Entertainment. One of the scenes cut from the film was near the beginning when two men approached Scrooge for a donation to the poor, and Scrooge asked them about prisons and workhouses. When Scrooge was told many would rather die than go there,he said they should do it to decrease the surplus population. The ghost of Christmas Present later repeats these words to Scrooge. In the cut version the ghost quotes something Scrooge said only in the uncut version! People whose opinion of the Seymour Hicks Scrooge movie is based on seeing the edited version should watch the whole film!Anyway, anyone really interested in the Seymour Hicks version should buy the complete version released by Image Entertainment. The complete film would have made a nice extra for this otherwise wonderful edition of the Alastair Sim \"A Christmas Carol.\"\n",
      "I've seen all the rest....this one is the best. It delivers the true meaning and purpose of Christmas. Alastair Sim is superb in creating the character of Scrooge.The other remakes, and even the original, do not portray Scrooge as well as the '51 classic. The recent Disney movie, \"A Christmas Carol\" starring Jim Carry should be classified as a horror movie. I saw more kids leaving the theater because they were scared and afraid. Not a real good way to portray the message of Christmas.\n",
      "I love this version for a billion reasons. The sound effects, the lighting, Alstair Sims is beyond amazing--his facial and vocal expressions are incomparable. All the actors are stupendous.The black and white format only makes it better, more timeless, more haunting, more heartfelt, more everything. Every December, I watch this as if I'm watching it for the first time. It remains strangely fresh and relevant.Treat yourself to this quintessential and perfect holiday treat.\n",
      "Alistair Sim at his best in this classic tale from C Dickens either b/w or colour ,the original 1935 edition is a collectors item and well worth viewing.I shall treasure this double cd and watch it every year,well worth the purchase.JGriffiths\n",
      "The holiday season is launched with this classic. It is by far the best traditional presentation of this story and Alistair Sim is perfect. Add this one to your collection for a true holiday experience that your family will never forget!\n",
      "I have enjoyed the Alistair Sim version of Christmas Carol since I was a young teenager.  My Christmas always seemed complete when being able to view this classic movie.I have always recommended this to anyone interested in \"A Christmas Carol\":\n",
      "To me, Alistair Sim is THE definitive Scrooge.  To me, all others pale in comparison.  The quality of the DVD excellent.  I will not though view the colorized version.  B&W is the way to view Scrooge!\n",
      "I use this in my classroom to teach drama. I use this to show the differences between the stories. It is old and sometimes hard to understand but that is the point.\n",
      "This is my all time number one fav Christmas movie.  Alistir Simm turns in a great performance.Will watch it again and again.\n",
      "Excellent movie.  Even after more than 50 years, it still makes us want to watch it again (and maybe again).Alistar Sim has top billing here, and deservedly so.  He, more than anything else, makes this version of \"A Christmas Carol\" the best of all versions.  Michael Hordern, as Marley's ghost, also does a great job (an eerie job ... where he goes overboard ... but it works), and he (Hordern) does equally well in the flash-back scene of Marley's death (this deathbed scene was an \"adaptation\" that had not actually been written by Charles Dickens).  Alistar Sim ... rarely out performed by any co-star ... is most believable in this deathbed scene .The lady playing Mrs. Dilber (Kathleen Harrison ... a very busy actress in her day) is absolutely great ... her form in the ragman's shop being delightfully decadent.  The actor who plays the Ghost of Christmas Past (Michael Dolan) is perfect for the part, I thought.  Tiny Tim here (Glyn Dearman) is the best I've seen (of all Tiny Tims) ... maybe a tad too big for the part ... but very sincere and naive and innocent.  Mervyn Johns as Bob Cratchit is very effective ... though perhaps a bit chubby for this role ... I mean ... at 15 shillings a week, with a family of six to feed ... it hardly seems likely.  And the actor who plays Mr. Fezziwig (Roddy Hughes) does a very nice job.Mrs. Cratchit is played by Hermione Baddeley who also played Ellen (\"It's Mrs. Banks ... she's  ome\") in \"Mary Poppins\".I am guessing the director should be given a lot of credit for this excellent quality, as all the actors and actresses seem to nail their parts down perfectly ... with there being very little if any over-acting.The background music is OK, but it occasionally is too loud (and perhaps a bit out of place) and the \"special effects\" of the turning hour glass (to signify passing time) does not quite cut the mustard either.  But this movie was premiered in 1951 ... not a terribly long time ago ... but perhaps long enough so that we should let them slide on these two points.\n",
      "The msde was received by due date in excellent condition!!\n",
      "I'm a purist.  It's almost sacrilegious to tamper with Dicken's timeless Christmas story, as the Reginald Owens version of the movie did, and if they had wanted to shoot the 1951 version in color, they would have done so.  Of all the versions of \"A Christmas Carol\", this is the only one to do the book justice.  Alastair Sim is the perfect Scrooge, just as Dickens wrote him.  The black/white version shows us, far more than the god-awful washed-out colorization, the dank and dark atmosphere lit only by the good-will of the season.  Scrooge's regeneration at the end of the film (\"Will you forgive a pig-headed old man...\") would melt a heart of adamant.  I watch this movie every Christmas season.  It just doesn't seem like Christmas without it.\n",

      "It was great. The DVD got here sooner then they said. The color edition was awsome. Love this DVD.\n",
      "This movie just gets better year after year.  This is the ultimate version of this well and often told story.  Other versions pale in comparison!  Considering the age of this movie, it is excellent quality and being in black & white makes it more special.  It would definately lose something if it was in color!  A must see and own for everyone who loves Christmas!!!\n",
      "Since I haven't seen this classic on TV for some time, and I love this version of this movie, buying it was a no brainer. All is well with this DVD!\n",
      "Beautiful story, for the holidays. One the whole family can enjoy and watch over and over again. One you must own.\n",
      "I've wanted this forever, It's one of the best. I used to watch this every holiday. What great memories this Film has.\n",
      "This is great!!!!!! This is a classic that I bought for my fiancé for a late holiday gift. Shipped quickly and would recommend\n",
      "I love this movie. It is a tradition at our house to watch this at Christmas. I highly recommend this movie.\n",
      "I am thrilled to get the DVD version of Alistair Sims  \"A Christmas Carol\".I feel it's the truest portrayal of the book and am looking forward to showing it to my classes!\n",
      "No other remake of A Christmas Carol can match Alaistair Sim's portrayal of Scrooge. Look for it every year, now I don't have to wait!!!\n",
      "As far as I'm concerned, it's the best version there is! If you don't like this one, then you don't keep Christmas as it were sir!\n",
      "This 1951, black and white film is the only version of \"A Christmas Carol\" I can watch repeatedly. Why anyone would seek to improve on such a cinematic masterpiece is beyond my ken.Alastair Sim's visceral transformation from an unrepentant, menacingly cruel misanthrope into that of an ebullient, loving philanthropist is nothing short of perfection and, on occasion, has brought tears of joy to my eyes. (And I don't even celebrate Christmas!)Believe me -- every other attempt to have filmed this wondrous tale, while certainly laudable, pales by comparison.\n",
      "I have more than a few versions of \"A Christmas Carol\", from the George C. Scott version to the Jim Carrey version.  I like this one alot because it has a few more scenes in the movie that are not in the others.  Alastair Sim's Ebenezer Scrooge is a great version because he portrays Scrooge not as \"snarly or vindictive\" but rather as cold as ice.  This Scrooge just doesn't care about anything other than how to get more money.  He doesn't yell, make mean faces or any of that, he just has a blank look about him like his empathy is gone.  The scenes with Marley are great because in this version, Jacob Marley is in scenes when \"The Ghost of Christmas Past\" shows Scrooge his life.  Marley sits with Scrooge with smiles as they do a \"hostile takeover\" of a brokerage.  Then the next scene shows Marley on his deathbed trying to warn Scrooge to change his ways.  This makes this movie even more interesting.  Great acting and scenery.  It is in black and white and that is okay since it was made back in 1951.  There is a 1930's version on this DVD as well that is quite good.  Great scenery, acting, and plot make this a must have to fans of Dickens classic tale.  Highly Recommended!\n",
      "This movie is truly a timeless classic.  Alister Sim gives a great performance and the effects are done very well for the time it was made.  You can't help but smile and laugh when Scrooge wakes up on Christmas morning full of good cheer and the Christmas spirit.\n",
      "This verion is the best of all of them.  Nice color and accurate dialogue make it a winner and 5 star addition to your holiday film collection.\n",
      "This is the best version of Dicken's story on film.Highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type of movie.\n",
      "This is undoubtedly the best version of Dickens' story and has been a staple in my house for as long as I remember. Alastair Sim was the definitive Scrooge and I haven't seen another portrayal that comes close. The only downside is the casting of the Cratchit family, other than Bob. The studio saw fit to give them upper-class British accents, and Tiny Tim, instead of being a withered little cockney boy on the point of death, is a strapping young fellow with gleaming hair and teeth and an accent which is more suited for Eton and Oxford than Camden Town. That apart, the other cast members are wonderful and Kathleen Harrison, given an expanded role as Scrooge's housekeeper, makes an excellent foil for the converted miser. The screenplay captures the spirit of the book without trying to be too literal and the special effects are excellent for the time. It's a Christmas tradition, and nothing more needs to be said.This release has some very good features, including both the B&W; and Colorized versions and unlike some others I think the color is well and sympathetically added and loses nothing compared to the B&W; original. It's the release everyone who loves the story, and this movie, should have.\n",
      "Based on Charles Dickens's most widely read and enduring story, this definitive 1951 British version, better known as \"Scrooge,\" outdoes all others for atmosphere and, of course, characterization. The incomparable Alastair Sim, a gifted actor who seamlessly inhabits his role, makes you believe he is Scrooge. Skillfully directed by Brian Desmond-Hurst, \"Carol\" is tight at roughly eighty-five minutes, yet remains extremely moving, with Sim's droopy eyes projecting all of Scrooge's terror, shame, and regret. By contrast, his outright giddiness at the film's conclusion will leave you feeling just the same way--very much in the holiday spirit.\n",
      "simply because of the excellent Scrooge played by Alister Sim.Scrooge has to carry the film obviously. The 1938 Hollywood version, is in some ways, better such as its supporting cast &  greater expositon of the story. Reginold Owens as Scrooge is fine, but it was a part built for John Barrymore. Who could fill those shoes? Unfortunately he was falling down drunk. He was injured & could not do it.The 1951 version is simply the best because if you don't have the best Scrooge you can't have the best Christmas Carol. It is regrettably short, but stll the best. See them both & compare. They are quite different versions of the same classic.\n",
      "Without adoubt the best version of the classic story ever.  It shows the dark and light sides of the story, which takes it above the candy box prettiness of the MGM version.  All the acting is first rate but special attention to Alistai Sim who owns the part of Scrroge.  Wonderfuly atmospheric photography and a fine score by richard Addinsell,  help make this a memorable film woth every penny.\n",
      "The Alastair Sim version of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol is by far the most beautiful and meaningful.  Alastair Sim is superb...without question, the perfect Ebenezer Scrooge of them all.  The movie and the book are about Redemption...before it's too late.\n",
      "of all the versions of the this movie this is my favorite and when it came out on blu I just had to have it.\n",
      "If you haven't seen this movie check it out. To me it's the best Scrooge out there and it comes black & white or in color.\n",
      "Few characters are a true part of culture. Various creatures come and go, but only a few really stick around for eternity.Ebenezer Scrooge is one of those rare characters such as George Bailey or The Terminator who are quoted or imitated or just remembered in everyday progression. How many times have you heard the word \"Humbug\" used to describe disgust or lack of enthusiasm?Every Christmas, there is a handful of films I watch. The most famous holiday tale of all time, \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" is always a first priority. I also enjoy watching Clark Griswald blunder about in \"Christmas Vacation,\" those nasty little critters wreak havoc in \"Gremlins,\" the bitter TV manager in \"Scrooged\" get taken back in time by three unconventional ghosts, Kevin McCallister defend his house in \"Home Alone,\" and Ebenezer Scrooge say \"Humbug.\"\"It's a Wonderful Life\" is, and shall remain, the better of the two. But \"Scrooge\" is a close second for the most likable and good-hearted holiday film. It's the best Charles Dickens book adaptation, and having read Dickens' work, it stays very true to the original.The story has been done with muppets and cartoon characters and even Bill Murray (a fine modern reworking, too), but this is and will remain the best version simply because everything about it is extraordinary. I think that many of the \"great movies\" are those that grow finer with age, and \"Scrooge\" gets only better and better every time I see it.Any filmgoer or classical literature fan is familiar with the story. Ebenezer Scrooge (Alastair Sim at his cranky best) is an old man living in London, England, thriving off the fortunes of his business but not able to enjoy the splendor of his wealth due to pure greed that exists within his soul.Scrooge is the dreaded town miser, the guy everybody moves out of the way for so they don't have to suffer the humiliation of being glared at by him. He walks through the streets of London with a scowl on his face and a look of extreme hatred. Nobody likes Scrooge, and Scrooge likes nobody, so it's a win-win situation.One Christmas Eve, after commanding family man Bob Cratchit (Mervyn Johns) to come to work the following morning, he retreats to his dark manor and is visited by four ghostly figures: his old friend and business partner, Jacob Marley (Michael Hordern) is the first, warning Scrooge that he will be visited by three more fellow unearthly beings. Scrooge is indeed visited by the various ghosts, first by The Ghost of Christmas Past (Michael Dolan), who takes Ebenezer Scrooge back in time to the point in his life when money meant nothing to him and happiness and love was everywhere.Then The Ghost of Christmas Present (Francis De Wolff) appears, showing Scrooge how other less fortunate beings such as Bob Cratchit are enjoying their Christmas, despite the fact that there is much sorrow and misery surrounding them. (Joy comes from the inside, remember?) Bob's son, Tiny Tim (another cultural icon), is a crippled boy who manages to look past the problems of life and appreciate the fine things. \"God bless us, every one,\" he says. It's the best line in the movie because it means so much.The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (C. Konarski) is the last of the spirits, giving Ebenezer a horrifying view into the future and the fate of his demise. This is Scrooge's ultimate wake up call, and the morning after (Christmas Day), Scrooge finally learns how to appreciate the fineness and pure joy of life. For greed, despite Gordon Gekko's prophecy, is not good.Alastair Sim isn't just good as Scrooge, he completely embodies him. He's grumpy and frumpy and in a split second manages to turn Scrooge into a likable character towards the end -- a character no longer driven by hatred and malice but rather by love and kindness.This is a universal theme as old as the days -- money isn't true happiness -- and \"Scrooge\" is the most clear and evident and believable example of this. It's a true classic story in the sense of the meaning, and not only does it deserve to be remembered as a fine story, the film itself deserved to be remembered as the classic it is.Over the years, Dickens' tale has been giving some acceptable and mediocre film treatments, and \"Scrooge\" is without a doubt the best of the best. From acting to set design, I can't imagine that, if Dickens were alive today, he'd find a single thing wrong with the adaptation of his beloved novel.Some movies are just fun, while other movies actually conceal important messages. \"Scrooge\" is, without a doubt, one of the most important and moralistic films ever made. Dickens' tale is one of the most black-and-white examples of greed vs. happiness, and the screen treatment is extraordinary: a story of learning to appreciate life instead of humbugging it. After all, nobody likes a humbugger.\n",
      "I've watched every version of 'A Christmas Carol', even animated versions, and while I love the storyline and the purpose of the story, there is no version out there that can do what this movie with Alastair Sim has done.  I've had it on VHS but decided that I have to get it on DVD.All time classic.\n",
      "\"A Christmas Carol\" don't appear on television anymore so this is a good investment.  It will round out your Christmas holiday to sit down with eggnog and cookies and view this timeless classic.\n",
      "A wonderful classic version of the Charles Dickens tale. It was my mom's favorite and it's mine too. A great Christmas movie for the family.\n",
      "This 1951 version is a classic.  Alastair Sim's portrayal of Scrooge's heart conversion is priceless and epitomizes what \"Christmas Spirit\" is all about.\n",
      "I won't go into great details on this except to say that I have owned about 10 different versions of this film, from way back to my Goodtimes LP speed VHS version, a Blockbuster VHS release, and a laserdisc version, to several DVDs, trying to get a quality print with the opening credits presented correctly (recent editions from VCI have had the first few seconds of the opening titles edited out thus eliminating the viewers first experience of Scrooge's musical cue).  The new DVD has a beautiful print taken from the British master (It's called Scrooge, not A Christmas Carol), the sound is great, and the entire credits are there.  Haven't had time to look at any extras, but for the inexpensive price I paid this is a quality set!\n",
      "The Sim portrayal of Scrooge is the best done by ANYBODY. The cinematography is dark and brilliant, almost like Gregg Toland's work in \"Kane\".The digital restoration is very good, but there are distracting compression artifacts in the standard DVD that show up in the deep shadows, at least on our computer and TV. I'm hoping a Blu-Ray player will improve on that.\n",
      "Undeniable classic!!! But...What in god's name have they done to the cover???Absolutely ludicrous photo-shopped image.An insult to a piece of film history...All involved should be ashamed!!!!No stars for this edition's artwork.\n",
      "Alastair Sim is great as Ebenezer Scrooge. A good rendition of Dickens'\"Christmas Carol\" with some good humor thrown in. I have this movie onVHS but also bought it on DVD hoping that the quality of the film will bea bit clearer.  I recommend it to everyone.\n",
      "This is my favorite version. It was the first I had ever seen and Alastair Sim is great.\n",
      "Alastair Sim is Hands Down the BEST SCROOGE EVER; This is the best done Christmas Carol presentation and there are many; it just can't be topped for acting, screenplay, directing and overall Authenticity!\n",
      "There are several versions of the Dickens story, I think this is the one closest to the original story. Well done, shows the wretched conditions most people lived in during the Victorian Era.Good performances from Sim and the supporting cast.\n",
      "A Christmas Carol has been restored by those amazing folks at VCI.  This company has been releasing classic films for several years now.  Their work has always been of top quality,  But this newly remastered classic of Alastair Sim's A Christmas Carol.  VCI has poured a lot of time and effort in restoring this film.  The film's transfer was digitally remastered from the original 35mm film elements and the soundtrack has been polished and cleaned up as well.  I have never seen this film look so crystal clear and brand spanking new.  The versions that have been previously released on video and for the small screen were real grainy and at times a tad blurry with a hissy and crackling soundtrack.  But not anymore thanks to the folks at VCI!This two disc set comes with a plethora of extras such as a computerized color version of the film (which looks pretty blah), the 1935 version of the film titled \"Scrooge\" (it's pretty sappy but entertaining), a 16 x 9 version of the film along with the standard one.  The soundtrack is also availible in the original mono and 5.1 Dobly Digital audio tracks.  A very informative commentary track featuring actor George Cole who has many interesting stories about the film and the actors. Several featurettes round out the extras along with two trailers for the film (England and North American).  If you want a definative version of the film that captures the heart and soul of the Charles Dickens' classic, then I implore you to obtain a copy of this DVD.Highly recommended.\n",
      "This is my all time favorite version of  A Christmas Carol.  It is always a joy to watch and perfect for the holiday season. Sim is the perfect actor for the movie.\n",
      "I bought this for my husband because out of all the versions of this story that have been created over the years, this one is his favorite. He really enjoys watching this and was glad to have his own copy rather than waiting for it to be shown on TV.\n",
      "On time, as promised.  Excellent quality on really old movies.  Made my holiday great.\n",
      "This is absolutely the best version of the classic- The Christmas Carol.  Alistair Sims covers all the range of characters for a convincing Ebenezer Scrooge- drama, comedy, and suspense.  Nobody does it better than Mr. Sims.\n",
      "There is nothing else I can add that hasn't been said already about this timeless film. Alastair Sim is brilliant as Scrooge. I'm just doing my part in giving another 5 stars to it. This was a gift for my father. He loves the film and is always waiting around for it to come on for the holidays. As he found out and I'm sure most people who love it did, you're very lucky if you can find this version on cable. so I decided it was time for him to own it. Thanks to Amazon, It arrived on Christmas Eve, and we were able to watch it after our Christmas dinner. Black and white is the only way to enjoy it in my opinion which was the reason I went with this version. Like most of you, I'm a traditionalist for Christmas. In closing, of course I would recommend this!\n",
      "This is by far my favorite version of A Christmas Carol.  Alastair Sim is just wonderful.  I prefer the original B&W version, though husband liked the colorized version better.  I dunno.... everything looks kind of brown in the color version, and the B&W has a crisper look.  But why quibble?  Just sit back and enjoy the movie!  Highly recommended for everyone.\n",
      "The Christmas Carol is one of the two Scrooge movie I love to watch so I had to buy this one too.\n",
      "What can you say about a movie that has lasted the test of time.  Have watched this movie at Christmas time ever since I was young.\n",
      "This has always been my favorite Christmas movie.  The dialogue follows Dickens story completely.  Alistair Sim  is both good in the beginning as a money-grubbing money changer and in the end as a changed man.  I have seen other versions and this one is the best of the black and white.  Good for all ages.\n",
      "Love this old version and the DVD was in excellent shape.It came in a timely manner. I will enjoy this one over and over\n",
      "This is by far my favorite version of A Christmas Carol. They hardly ever play it on TV any more, so it was so nice to find it in Blue-ray.  I still love this version.\n",
      "No nonsense and the best one to watch with the kids.  It has great acting and is in London, with real accents versus actors trying to be British.\n",
      "This has been my favorite version of \"A Christmas Carol\" since I first saw it on TV years ago.  My copy was VHS, and I decided to get the DVD version.  There's a lot of charm in watching an old movie in the original black and white, especially one like this, but the color version is fun.  I enjoy both, and now I get to watch it twice a season!\n",
      "The Alastair version of A Christmas Carol is by far the cream of the crop.  I have been watching this version since I can remember, I am presently 57 yrs. old.  It is not only a Christmas tradition with me but with my entire family.I have also read Dickens novel, and found this version closest to his writting, also being a Brittish production adds more reality, since the actors have Brittish accents and the movie is set in England.Mervyn Johns gives an excellent portrayal of Jacob Marley, unlike the portrayal of Leo G. Carroll in the American version.This version is a Movie classic, not just a Christmas classic..the rest are just, \"BAH HUMBUG!!!\".\n",
      "This is without a doubt the best version and Alastair Sim is THE best Ebeneezer Scrooge. One thing I have noticed though: near the end of the film when Scrooge is \"redeemed\" on Christmas Day, he looks in the mirror.If you look closely, you can see a boom operator in the mirror behind Mr. Sim. Cool!God Bless Alastair Sim!\n",
      "Excellent transfer of this classic film. Blu-ray reveals the limitations of old special effects, but so what? Alistair Sim remains the gold standard for Scrooge, though the George C. Scott and Patrick Stewart versions have their charms.\n",
      "I bought all the versions of Scrooge and Christmas Carol that I could find on Amazon. This one along with one other are my most favorite Christmas movies of all time.\n",
      "Alistair Sim is amazingly perfect as Scrooge.  Some versions of the film have been colorized, which nearly ruins it, so I was glad to find a reasonably priced black and white version.  If you buy it, make sure you're getting the B&W rather than colorized; I believe Amazon carries both.\n",
      "This is one of our favorites to watch, great acting for the time and very emotional! Great Classic! Must Watch\n",
      "A Jack Warner classic. I remember watching it with family when I was a child. The cast is perfect. I have seen many versions but to me this is the only one. Alastair Sim is Scrooge. It is like watching the story come to life from the window of a time machine. True cinematic capture of the Victorian era and Dickens himself. Very uncanny.\n",
      "[This review is of the original black-&-white film, which is available on DVD as the 50th Anniversary Edition.  This is not an endorsement of the colorization ....]The character of Scrooge, in the context of Dickens's classic but strangely little-heeded tale, has been a little easy for actors who enjoy current fashion to \"use.\" Alastair Sim genuinely creates Dickens's character, his performance here is masterful and a delight, and brings forth the complete character of Scrooge, and not merely a caricature. I live in New England, and I have been working in a bank for seven years, but I watch this, and I wonder that the people around me (who would be horrified by the suggestion, I am sure) don't take the message ... there are many here who, though they have been \"taught to\" despise Scrooge, actually emulate his methods, and if they saw the character without the cultural baggage of the name \"Scrooge,\" would say, \"Why? What's wrong with him? He's just doing good business ....\"Scrooge's repentance and rebirth on Christmas morning, are made perfectly convincing by Alastair Sim here. All through the movie, you had really believed he was the hardened old miser who had buried deep any vestige of humane compassion; and you really believe that he has cast off those shackles on Christmas morning, and that his spirit is singing -- and you really believe that he is going to do otherwise, now, and for the good of others.Rightly appreciated in all its depth and ramifications, this book is one of the most marvelous literary products of nineteenth-century England. And this film does it COMPLETE justice, not least in its feeling like a Carol, a song which is also a dance, celebrating a season of Joy.\n",
      "I was ecstatic to finally get this movie! Yes, there are many versions of A Christmas Carol, but this version is the best hands down and is not shown on tv a lot. THANK YOU!!!\n",
      "Viewrs who are passionate about films adhering to the integrity of the original text will be delighted with this dickens classic which is rich in the flavor of the language,culture and spirit of the Victorian England which Sims and the other actors portray.\n",
      "I like the original version as it reminds me of the first time I watched this as a little girl, with my family.\n",
      "This is the \"Christmas Carol\" that we \"boomer\" watched every Christmas.  Alistair Sim brings Scrooge to life as a stingy man of business - shaped by the loss of love and thirst for wealth to replace it.\n",
      "This is the best version. I love the facial expressions, the accent and the touch of humor in this version.\n",
      "Our family watches this every year and we needed a new copy. Delivery was fast. We have not watched it yet, so hope it is in good condition. Excellent price.\n",
      "This 1951 adaptation of A Christmas Carol used to be shown on at least one TV station every holiday season but disappeared in recent years. I consider it the best one and missed it so I bought the DVD. The quality is excellent. There is also a 'colorized' version included but I think colorizing original black and white films is pretty ridiculous. So we watched the black and while and loved it once again.\n",
      "I was so happy to find this! I've seen many different versions of this movie and I had to add this to my collection! Still one of the better versions of the story and well worth keeping!\n",
      "I would recommend this movie to all the christmas carol movie people this is one i have been watching for years and it is one that we watch every thanksgiving night to kick of the holiday season\n",
      "If you're going to buy one Christmas movie this year, make it A Christmas Carol Ultimate Collector's Edition.It doesn't get much better than this. VCI Entertainment gave us a present worth opening year 'round: a loving restoration of Alastair Sim as \"Scrooge.\" This is the Real Deal; the restoration used the talented folks at Point 360 -- and it shows.  Both film and sound quality rate a solid 5. For the first time in 50 years, one is able to experience this film as it must have been in first release: richly textured and luminous.  (Minter's British winter looks warm.)  Alastair Sim is the quintessential Ebenezer Scrooge.  He's a miser and a lot cruel; and nobody's going to change him. And then, one Christmas Eve, he has four very rare visitors... Sim's Scrooge believes the story; so we believe.  His transformation is truly joyous, if inexplicable to the rest of his world. \"Scrooge\" is perfectly cast down to the smallest roles. Things to watch for: the blind man's dog, Marley's SHRIEK, the rich men who refuse to attend a certain funeral unless luncheon is served, the Crachits (of course), and the wonderfully incongruous, laughing Jumeau in the toy store window.  \"Scrooge\" is a joy to watch. It just is. \"God Bless Us. Every One!\"VCI's intent is obvious: the company wants everybody to enjoy this movie and it provides 3 formats in order to do it! Along with 4x3, a \"colorized\" version and an enhanced widescreen 16x9 version are included. (The \"enhanced\" version appears to cut off the tops of certain visuals, like the toy store window display. The \"colorized\" version is done in soft, matte colors and isn't bad as far as these things go... The Original 4x3 theatrical version is by far the best!)  \"Scrooge\" is the first movie I own to have an audio track for the Blind. However, it isn't Closed Captioned. VCI blundered making the subtitles red.  For those of us with Aphasia and other learning disabilities, red is difficult to process if not impossible to read. For a company that obviously wants its product to be accessible, the red subtitles are a mystery.Disc 1:Original 4x3 (original theatrical ratio)Film Quality 4.5-5  (On a scale of 1 to 5)Sound Quality 5Subtitles - in RED - English & SpanishCommentary Track with Marcus Hern & George ColeEnglish with Narrative for the Blind16x9 Version for Widescreen TVs, with access the above featuresDisc 2\"colorized\" version1935 \"Scrooge\"Extras:TrailersSpirit of Christmas PastRichard Gordon remembers George Minter and  Renown PicturesCharles Dickens, His Life and TimesBefore & After RestorationPhoto Gallery\n",
      "Great, I like the fact that the movie industry is transfering these timeless treasures into DVD form.Alistar Sim is the Character of Scrooge that Charles Dickens would have cast this is Fantastic version buy-it.\n",
      "This is without a doubt the best version of the Charles Dicken's classic ever made.  If you only have one Christmas film in your collection it should be this one.\n",
      "Alastair Sim has NO PEER when it comes to portraying Scrooge. It was less a movie and more a stage play. His emotions run from angry, nasty, all the way to giddy on Christmas morning. I don't care if you have ALL the other CC movies/videos; If you DON'T HAVE this one....shame on you for six weeks. Though Dickens couldn't have forseen this, if he had his choice, I'm sure this would be it for the video adaptation of his Classic Christmas book.Trust me. Get this one. Don't wait for Christmas to see it, watch it now and you'll see. I've seen it numerous times on TV before I saw this one..and grabbed it FAST!\n",
      "This is the version that so many feel is the definitive Christmas Carol. It really is an excellent version. Alastair Sim plays Ebenezer Scrooge like no one else can. The believability factor here for both, the 'old mean Scrooge' and the 'newly transformed Scrooge' is very high, with the transformation itself coming about slowly.  And that's what I like about this version. Scrooge doesn't suddenly become happy and giddy from the first of the three spirits, as in the Reginald Owen version. It takes Sim's old Ebenezer fully until the last spirit to convince him that he truly was a \"squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!\"Victorian London is well represented here, its sinister darkness, dreariness, and hopelessness surrounding the viewer in glorious black and white to further the mood of the dirty old town.This version has my favorite Jacob Marley (listen to the way he mourns and moans. Sends chills!). And Mrs. Dilber is hilarious at the end when Scrooge gives her a Christmas gift of money.I collect the different versions of this movie that are available, and this one is my second favorite, with the George C. Scott version ranking number one and the Patrick Stewart version, with the best Cratchit family I have yet to see captured on film,  coming in at number three. All have a bit to add to the story (including the Reginald Owen version) that the others may not have. All, pretty much, follow Dickens' original story (although, I must say, the George C. Scott version is truest to the book in the dialogue). Jacob Marley and Scrooge from Alastair Sim, the Cratchit's and the whole 'present' scene from Patrick Stewart, the dialogue and the sets from George C. Scott. My advice? By them all! Really! If you trust my opinion (and you have no copies of any version yet), purchase them in the order that I have placed them. You won't be sorry.\n",
      "This is the actor I remember as a child who played Scrooge & in my opinion portrays the part the best. I really like this original version of this classic.\n",
      "One of the best!  Was shipped quickly and packaged well - great purchase experience.  I gave this one away as a gift, now have to buy one for myself!\n",
      "This is as good as this wonderful movie will ever look; a jewel in the firmament. The nuts and bolts commentary spends ten minutes talking about the studio and the history and particulars are really welcomed. Make room for this one and give it as a gift.\n",
      "Amazon seems to have mixed up the reviews, so I will say that I am writing about the 1999 DVD of Alistair Sim's A Christmas Carol as released by VCI. I also have the 2007 release, and this 1999 disc is MUCH more enjoyable. Not a perfect transfer of the movie, but good enough to get lost in and revel in Sim's and all the other actors' marvelous performances.Avoid the 2007 2-disc set at all costs.\n",
      "I'm very satisfied with this dvd.I had been looking at all the local stores and couldn't find. I'm glad I searched the internet.\n",
      "Every year we have watched this movie while wrapping gifts. It is a classic and seeing on DVD digital quality is great.\n",
      "love the movie, excellent picture quality. love the bonus extras. I would recommend this movie highly to anyone and this site\n",
      "My favorite Scrooge.  I was frustrated missing the showing on TV every year.  I am so glad I have this DVD to watch anytime during the Christmas season.\n",
      "This is the standard by which all other screen adaptations of \"A Christmas Carol\" should be judged. The other reviews here have spelled it out as well as I could, so I'll just add this: I disagree with those who insist that the B/W version is the only one to watch. The colorized version (on DVD) is proof that colorization *can* improve an old classic. The audio is clearer, the images are crisper and the color adds to the enjoyment.\n",
      "This is, without question, the diamond of any and all versions of Dickens' classical tale. I have 3 other versions starring Reginald Owen, George C Scott and Patrick Stewart, and while they all have their own merits this is by far and away the best.Alistair Sim IS Scrooge! His portrayal of the mean, miserly, contemptible old Scrooge is beyond eqaul.There are alot of comments here about the extras included with this collection and I'm not going to even touch on those. I have not watched any of these extras and do not know if I even will or care to - I did not purchase this set for the extras, but for the film itself. VCI has done an exemplary job in restoring the original film. The picture is sharp and the sound is clear, making this treasured movie a joy to watch over and over again.If you enjoy this classic tale and are undecided which version to get, stop deciding and choose this one. It is the ultimate version.\n",
      "I do not care how many makeovers they do of this Alastair Sim was the `BEST!!!  Christmas classics would not be with out him in your library.  Loved him...I received it in record time from Amazon.  Thank you Amazon.\n",
      "I have seen all of the big film productions of Dicken's Christmas Carol, and by far this is the best portrayal of Scrooge of any of them.  Take nothing away from the distinguished artists who have also portrayed the character; Alistaire Sim is both the most dispicable and most reformed of any that I have seen.  The colorized version is wonderful, as well as the adpated version for the wide screen.  I also appreciated the inclusion of the 1939 version.  It is a paltry movie compared to Sim's powerful portrayal, but worthy of note as, I believe, the original.The biggest advantage of this edition is the digital restoration of the original black and white film.  It is simply excellent.Make this version of Dicken's Christmas Carol part of your family's Holiday season, and you won't regret it.\n",
      "This version of A Christmas Carol is by far the best out there.  Alistair Sim is truly wonderful in the part and expresses the lost Scrooge beautifully.  He's smart and funny, sad and misguided.  And when he wakes on Christmas morning....his elation is contagious.\n",
      "This (in its original black and white incarnation) is my favorite version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL. Alastair Sim defines Ebenezer Scrooge. Nobody else has done it better.Nobody else ever will.The story needs no recounting (but I will anyway). Nasty old Scrooge treats all the world like dirt until he's visited by the enchained ghost of his dead business partner, Jacob Marley, whose face first appears in the midst of Scrooge's demonic doorknocker. Marley warns Scrooge to mend his ways or suffer the same miserable eternal fate. Scrooge \"Bah! Humbug!\"s him, but is then visited by the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future who review his life with him.This film version is faithful to Dickens and includes Scrooge's warm relationship with his sister (who dies in childbirth) and his ill-fated engagement. Though Scrooge is a miserable misanthrope, these episodes gain him some of the viewer's empathy. Scrooge thus appears less evil than merely lonely, a man who won't care because care causes pain. And he constantly looks like he's going to plotz.Sim is wonderful in this role. His bulging eyes give him a fearsome look, and his consistent tactlessness grates on everyone he meets---\"Are there no jails? Are there no workhouses? Let them die, then, and decrease the surplus population.\"Sim really excels, though, when his Scrooge wakes up happy on Christmas morning. His manic, childlike joy in everything is infectious---\"I'm going to stand on my head, yes I will! I don't deserve to be so happy! Oh, I can't help it!\"The viewer can't help being happy right along with him.\n",
      "While it is nice to have the colorized version, the B&W; is the best way to enjoy this timeless classic.  This movie is my favorite of all the Christmas Carol variants produced over the years.  The engaging story of redemption is one that made a huge impact on my as youth.  Fully restored, it now sparkles on my TV, looking better than I rember it from when it was on broadcast television so many years ago.  Of course, TVs are a lot better too these days, hahaha.I was impressed by the wealth of features included, colorized version included.  The bio of Dickens was particularly interesting for me, and the Hearn and Cole commentary insightful.If you want to give a real gift to someone you care about this holiday season, you could do worse than this wonderful movie.  Introduce your children or grandchildren to the cinema version of Dicken's story the right way.  5 stars well deserved!\n",
      "My family has been watching this version of A Christmas Carol every Christmas Eve for years. It is the classic story of Ebenezer Scrooge (well played by Alistair Sim in this version) who thinks Christmas is a waste of time and money. As he is visited by three ghosts of Christmas past, Christmas present, and Christmas future, he starts to be transformed by the true spirit of Christmas. A wonderful holiday classic!\n",
      "My family has watched this every Christmas Eve (just before we all \"settled down for a long winter's nap\") for as long as I can remember. To this date, I have never written a review, owned a Blu-Ray player, or bought anything on Blu-Ray, but this will be the very first one I buy for sure. I can't go one Christmas without having seen this. I can't really say for sure what the picture-transfer will be like, but I've owned this on VHS, 2 times on standard DVD, so this version is a given. If I could have rated it with more stars, I would have. If you like a non-book version of this particular story, you would be crazy to pass this up.\n",
      "It just wouldn't be Christmas without Alastair Sims as Ebenezer Scrooge. This is undoubtedly the best version ever made, bar none. The blue ray delivered a high-quality, crisp image of this 1951 black and white film. Loved every moment of it.\n",
      "no complaints. the video arrived in perfect condition and happily it arrived ahead of schedule. i will definitely use them again.\n",
      "this is one of the best renditions of \"A Christmas Carol\" It is amazing the special effects that were possible back then...and truly \"back then\" was in the 50's but they didn't have the computer graphics etc. that we have now....a really great movie.\n",
      "And it was great to find it in true Black & White.  Worth every penny.\n",
      "Alistair Sim is by far the best Scrooge ever.  His performance is one of the greatest in the history of cinema.  Christmas isn't the same without Alistair, and I had to have the blueray, as my DVD is wearing out.\n",
      "This movie is a favorite of my mother's and I wanted to give it to her as a Christmas gift. I was so happy to find it here because we could not find it in stores here. It came on time and she was delighted.\n",
      "I never let a Christmas season go by without spending time with this movie.  The old-time \"special effects\" are strangely perfect, and it makes me a better person every year (at least temporarily).  This is the quintessential Christmas Carol with the quintessential Scrooge.  Perfect.\n",
      "This movie is such a delight and I look forward to watching it every year.I have seen many versions of \"A Christmas Carol\" including the ones starring Reginald Owen and George C. Scott.  Both were very good, however in my opinion, this is the finest version of this movie ever made.Alastair Sim was perfect in the role of Ebenezer Scrooge. The other actors portraying the characters in this movie were outstanding as well, and the entire essence of this film was just wonderfully done.I can sum this one up by saying \"It don't get no better than that!\"\n",
      "Christmas has come a little bit early this year with the release of the ultimate collectors' edition of A Christmas Carol starring Alastair Sim.  This great British movie has been a classic holiday staple of television for decades but often appears so grainy as to be wearing on the eyes.  The remastered version here is so crystal clear it almost is shocking to those of us used to the eroded copies commonly televised.  Both the original B&W; and colorized versions are here but the B&W; is far preferable as it captures the mood much better.  As with all such collectors' editions there are a wealth of extras to supply background information that may be of interest to the film buffs but nothing can add much to finally having a quality version of the film.Ah, yes - the film!!  It's a general rule that movies can never do justice to a great book but every rule has an exception and this superb version of \"A Christmas Carol\" is one of them.  The script, acting, and direction are all superb in this wonderful adaptation of the Dickens' classic about greed, redemption, and the Christmas spirit.  Alastair Sim gives an unforgettable performance as the curmudgeonly Scrooge who is given the chance to change his eternal fate by the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future.  No other film version of this holiday tale has ever approached the warmth and depth of this one.This version of \"A Christmas Carol\" stands among the greatest of Christmas films ever made and now the beauty of it has been made accessible for generations to come.  Merry Christmas Everyone!\n",
      "Great for Family:We are taking our grandchildren to see a stage production next month and I purchased this as a way of telling them the story (they are a little young for me to read the story to them).  With help, they enjoyed it.  Their parent and grandparents consider this version  a masterpiece of adaptation.\n",
      "With all the different reviews I wondered about this as to the quality of the picture but decided to take the chance.  There was absolutely no problem with the picutre.  It was very clear, everything about the packaging and titles, everything was in english. Of course the movie was great but I had no doubts about that. I have watched this movie for so many Christmas', it's one of my favorites. Now I don't have to wait for it to come out on TV I have it when I'm ready to watch it and as many times as I want to. I'm very glad I decided to get this one.\n",
      "Finale in DVD and still in B&W but great clarity, digitally inhanced. BUY IT if you liked the VCR version!!!\n",
      "I watch this every year.  As far as i am concerned it is the best out there.  Alistair Sims fits the part of Scrooge sowell. there's none better.  Now my daughter also watches it and loves it too.\n",
      "Great B&W, very good colorized.  Though, as I am over 60 years old, I am partial to the old B&W version. Black and White always seems to add to a movie without taking away any of the quality of the story. Not usually so with a remake in color, though I understand why many of today's croud prefer it.  It's like pumping in laughfter (not necessary) trying to add to a movie and usually ends up with a negative result.  A good movie needs only a great story and good actors , a great movie needs only a good story with exceptionaly great actors. As it should be.\n",
      "The story of \"Scrooge\" has been told many times by many , many actors, however, i do believe that this version of the film of all \"Scrooge\" films is the \"darkest\" of them all and truly one of the best of all time. Highly Recommended!!!\n",
      "This was delivered in a timely manner and in perfect shape. I always wanted this on DVD because you can't always rely on seeing this particular version when the Christmas season comes around. There is no other version that can compare with this one with Alistair Sim.\n",
      "As a kid I always looked forward to this version of the Christmas Carol being aired.  Sometimes I feared it wouldn't be shown but usually it was and I got opportunitiy to watch it.  Now I can watch whenever I want and I think the Blu Ray presenation has really enhanced the sharpness of the picture.  I know the \"purests\" don't like colorization of movies, but I do and I have a copy of this in color as well and I like that too.\n",
      "This movie was great - brought back a lot of memories of watching it as a child.  I really liked tht it came with two DVD's  one black & white version and one colorized- that way you can choose which to watch!\n",
      "I do agree with other reviews here that this is the BEST version to see.If you have to choose one version of Christmas Carol, to watch,this is the one. The only one I look forward to. Highly recommended.\n",
      "The 1951 version of \"A Christmas Carol\" comes down to the performance of Alastair Sim (To set the record straight, this film was released as \"Scrooge\" in the United Kingdom and as \"A Christmas Carol\" in the United States). Other versions have better known supporting casts and are in color, but this one has Alastair Sim. This British actor did other films: \"The Belles of St. Trinian's,\" \"The Millionairess,\" and \"The Ruling Class.\" But you probably do not remember noticing him. There have been lots of great Scrooges, from George C. Scott and Mr. MaGoo to Scrooge McDuck and Patrick Stewart, from all of them had other roles. George C. Scott will always be Patton and Patrick Stewart will never stop being Jean-Luc Picard, no matter how many times he plays Professor X. But Alastair Sim was \"only\" Ebenezer Scrooge.This is not to diminish the rest of the cast. Michael Hordern is the match of Alec Guiness as Jacob Marley and his ghost, Hermione Baddeley is as fine a Mrs. Cratchit as we have seen, Francis De Wolff is a boisterous Ghost of Christmas Present, and Glyn Dearman is a perfect Tiny Tim. But we keep coming back to the point that Alastair Sim is Scrooge. This film is only 85 minutes long, but it covers the entire classical story by Charles Dickens. Screenwriter Noel Langley sticks close to the original (he would adapt \"The Pickwick Papers\" the following year), but tampering with this one is not advised. Director Brian Desmond Hurst's film is in black & white, but that hardly seems important (and colorization is a clear cut case of heresy) given C. Pennington-Richards's beautiful cinematography and Ralph Brinton's gorgeous art direction recreating old London town.But we keep coming back to Sim in a performance that sometimes has you wondering why anybody ever dared to essay the role again. Whether he is playing the heartless boss of Bob Crachit, the stingy miser who wants the poor to hurry up and die, the terrified old man confronting the ghost of his dead partner, the remorseful old man looking back at the happy days of his youth, the sobered figure looking at his own grave, and the giddy soul who keeps Christmas in his heart all the rest of the days of his life. You can enjoy many different versions of \"A Christmas Carol,\" but this one remains extra special, and we all know who gets the credit.\n",
      "It \"ain't\" Christmas without watching this amazing, classic film. Alistair Sim set the standard for Ebeneezer Scrooge, that I feelhas never been equaled. It is a tradition that I relish and I do not tire of being reminded of the true \"meaning of Christmas.\"\n",
      "This is my favorite movie. And the one with Alastair Sim is my very favorite. Alastair Sim does a wonderful portrayal of Scrooge and I can watch this one over and over!! If you are looking for a great Christmas movie this one is it!\n",
      "Wonderful delivery service and timely.The product is in excellent condition and views very well.Thank you.\n",
      "It's just not Christmas without watching this movie. I had the VHS tape and figured I would upgrade considering the price.\n",
      "The definitive version of this wonderful film. More modern interpretations simply don't compare. Watch it and you will be in the Christmas spirit.\n",
      "This was exactly what I was looking for and love watching it in the black and white version.  Love it.\n",
      "Christmas Carol is one of my favorites to watch any time of the year. Our family likes to sit down and watch it together.\n",
      "I've watched the 1951 version of \"A Christmas Carol\" every year of my life - it has always meant 'Christmas' to me. Now it's better than ever. The b&w; print is absolutely pristine, as clean as if it were made yesterday. Even the colorized version (I'm not a fan of colorizing) looks good. Nice to have a choice of full-screen or letterbox, as well.If you've been settling for lesser adaptations of this classic story, do yourself and your family a favor and try the Alastair Sim version. The characterizations are perfect - Sim is a perfect Scrooge, and the other actors did beautiful jobs as well, particularly Kathleen Harrison as Mrs. Dilber and Mervyn Johns as Bob Cratchit.The special features aren't all that great, however, so only four stars out of five. One of the extras is quite fun to watch, though: the 1935 Seymour Hicks version of 'Scrooge'. Although grainy, jerky, and unimaginative in terms of dealing with the ghosts (Marley isn't there at all, you have to imagine him!) it's lovely to see one of the very early movie versions of the story, filmed not quite a hundred years after the original was written.\n",
      "I have been looking for this DVD for some time, glad I finally got it. Thanks!\n",
      "This is the best Scrooge, to me. Alastair Sim is amazing. I like the extras included with this disc. I've watched it several times, with the special features and enjoyed it every time.\n",
      "WOW!!  I've watched this movie for years at Christmas.  With the Blu Ray I can't believe what I've missed!!  You can see the frayed threads in the coat!!  Incredible!!  And the opening review of the movie was really educational!!\n",
      "Our copy of A Christmas Carol recently broke.  We ordered a replacement through Amazon. com and in no time at all it was here at our front door.  Thank you.  The upcoming Christmas holiday would not have been the same without it.\n",
      "a classic by far the best movie version of the Dickens story Alistair Sim is great a true classic for all times\n",
      "Alistar Sim is Scrooge. The supporting cast is also excellent. Maybe because it was made just 5 years after WW II ended, the cast was able to capture Dicken's intent.\n",
      "This was the original A Christmas Carol that I remember watching as a kid. Brings back a flood of memories!\n",
      "I had been looking for this version of The Christmas Carol for a long time.  I really will enjoy watching this on Christmas eve with a glass of eggnog.  I have seen every version and this version from 1951 is the best one.  I love it no matter how many times I see it.\n",
      "THIS IS ULTIMATE A CHRISTMAS CAROL THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN.  YES, THERE ARE LOTS OF REMAKES THAT ARE VERY GOOD, BUT ALISTAIR SIM IS EBENEEZER SCROOGE! WE WATCH THIS MOVIE EVERY CHRISTMAS (IN BLACK AND WHITE, OF COURSE) ON A COLD SNOWY NIGHT IN FRONT OF A ROARING FIRE. AND IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT!\n",
      "I WAS VERY HAPPY TO FIND A COPY OF MY FAVORITE CHRISTMAS MOVIE JUST A WEEK BEFORE CHRISTMAS...THE VENDOR SHIPPED IT VERY QUICKLY AND I WAS ABLE TO WATCH THE MOVIE ON CHRISTMAS EVE...EXCELLENT QUALITY TAPE AND IT ADDED TO A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS!\n",
      "Lots of people like the George C. Scott version.  I am not a fan.  This version, for me, is the best and the one that I have to watch every Christmas.  It is an absolute MUST SEE!\n",
      "This is my favorite all time holiday movie.  It's the first one I watch during the X-mas season and the last one before I go to bed X-mas night...not to mention the other numorous times during the entire month of December.  I just love it. Alastair Sim's facial expressions during each new enlightenments and preparing to go out the window with The Ghost of X-mas Past are just priceless.\n",
      "this movie has been part of my 'christmas movie' collection for about 20 years. But it was in VHS, very worn out, very scratchy over time. I ordered this DVD, received it in a few short days, and of course, it's wonderful. Thank you for your prompt service!\n",
      "\"A Christmas Carol\" is one of those stories that everyone knows, even if they have never read the book. It is doubtful they have not seen some version of this story; whether on Tv or a movie.  I have seen just about every film version ranging from \"A Muppets Christmas Carol\" to the newer televised musical version with Kelsey Grammar.  Some version are too sentimental, and some take a great deal of liberties, but after having read the book the 1951 version with Alastair Sim as Scrooge, keeps to the spirit and feel of the book most closely.On this DVD is THREE different version of the 1951 film.  One is the normal full screen, the other is meant for wide screen, and the third is color (which I was disappointed that it was not as beautifully restored as the B&W; version).  Either way you watch the movie it is a feast to the eyes, and all the performances are so wonderful, even if you hate old movies, you should love this!  On top of these versions of the 1951 version, included is also the 1935 film \"Scrooge\".  This is an enjoyable film, but there is no restoration on it so it is very dark.The extras are so plentiful compared to older DVD versions of this film I do not think that you would be wrong to buy a new one, if the newly restored film doesn't attract you.  These include a nice comparison between the restored and non-restored film, \"Spirit of Christmas Past\" which looks back on Alastair Sim's career and life, beautifully done cast bios, subtitles in spanish and english, and even a biography of Charles Dickens!  It is near impossible to become bored with this DVD collection.This is my new favorite version of \"A Christmas Carol\" because of its beauty, great acting, and faithfulness to the book.  So, I hope that you enjoy this movie, and it moves you into the Christmas spirit!God Bless & *Enjoy* ~Amy\n",
      "while some prefer more recent reincarnations, the true Dickens fan must always watch the Alistair Sim version.  His ability to convey greed, disgust, fear, joy, penitence, by just the look on his face, is truly remarkable.\n",
      "I was very happy to see that my collector's edition was composed of not only the original black and white version but also a colorized version.  I did not received until after Christmas but as soon as I got it I opened up the box and watched the black and white version.  Great as always. My favorite Christmas movie besides Rudolf.  Have not viewed the colorized version yet, but am looking forward to it.\n",
      "very good movie that have lasted for years.  This is a special family movie that you can share with your loved ones, and hopefully make great memories of.\n",
      "Very good version. Love old movies and this fits the bill for an old favorite. Watch it every year along with 2 other versions.\n",
      "Just what I was looking for and extras. I like having the option to view it in orginal black and white or the colorized version. Thanks!\n",
      "RECEIEVD ON TIME! GREAT CONDITION. CLASSIC FAVORITE OF MY FAMILYS' TRADITION OF CHRISTMAS MOVIES! BOUGHT IT FOR MY MOM, SHE LOVED IT! PRICE GOOD AND WILL ORDER AGAIN FROM SELLER!\n",
      "My all time favorite movie for Christmas. The best version of all movies made and the most realistic of all others made. It sure is a treasure to me to have. I think everyone should see this version.\n",
      "Great movie.The sound is good as is the video. It is well worth the money to add it to your collection.\n",
      "A Christmas Carol is one of my all time favorites. So far I have watched it three times since it arrived. I was in excellent condition.\n",
      "A classic I have yearned to see on tv but has been scrubbed in favor of newer versions. Glad to have found this particular version featuring Alastair Sim.\n",
      "I originally criticized Amazon for confusing advertising.  I thought they sent me a color version when I wanted B & W for Christmas.  This IS the black and white single disc version of my family's beloved classic. I'm afraid \"Holiday Head\" lead me to an incorrect conclusion at first. Sorry Amazon.\n",
      "I have at least 5 interpretations/ adaptations of the Dickins classic this one is the iconic version, most complete, best adaptation\n",
      "Always the best no matter how many other versions I have seen.In black and white ... it almost appears as if \"You Are There!\"\n",
      "We watch this every Christmas eve.  I had an old VHS copy that you could barely view so had to buy it.  I think this is the best version of scrooge.\n",
      "Although I have only seen the movie once, it teaches a great lesson on changing for the good and learning from mistakes. My dad loves the movie soo much, and has made a tradition of watching it every Christmas Eve at 10:30. He was using an old DVD that was beginning to look much too worn. I got him this for Christmas to go with his new bluray player, and he loved it!\n",
      "I ordered this from Standing Ovation a few years ago and got it within 2 days; just ordered another movie from them last week and paid a little bit more for it because of their excellent service...this time I loved the movie I ordered, but was very disappointed that there was no tracking information for my order...that makes me question whether I will ever order from Standing Ovation again.\n",
      "This is a must at Christmas time.  I love this colorized version.  Will be watching it again for Christmas in July!\n",
      "The best of all Scrooges! A favorite with all the family. It's a Christmas tradition.\n",
      "I WAS AMAZED AT HOW GREAT THE QUALITY WAS ON THIS DVD. WATCHING IT BROUGHT BACK MANY GOOD MEMORIES.  THANKS!!!\n",
      "Scrooge is a wealthy London miser who refuses to make charitable contributions and treats his employee, Bob Cratchit, as an indentured servant. On Christmas Eve Scrooge is visited by the ghost of his former business partner, Jacob Marley, as selfish as Scrooge and now condemned to forever wandering Earth in chains. Marley warns Scrooge that he's to see a trio of spirits that will take him on a journey through Christmases Past, Present, and the Future. During these visions Scrooge realizes how mean he's been and adopts a new cheery outlook and seeks redemption. Both the plot and the acting are excellent!\n",
      "This is my absolute favorite movie version of A Christmas Carol.  Yearly I anxiously awaited for theChristmas Eve broadcast until sadly, several years ago, it no longer aired.  Now I can resume the traditionof viewing it every Christmas Eve with family and friends.\n",
      "This item arrived as promised and in fantastic condition.  I will not be missing this movie during the Christmas season again.  Love it and thank you for a great transaction.  I couldn't ask for better.\n",
      "Sim is the ultimate Scrooge. Love his transformation.\n",
      "There have been many versions of A Christmas Carol over the decades, but this one with Alastair Sim is our all time favorite and Christmas just isn't the same unless we watch it every year.  We definitely recommend it.\n",
      "I purchased this for my brother as a gift and he absolutely loved it. He said it was very clear and it was the original version. Great gift for movie buffs!\n",
      "This is the masterpiece Christmas Carol.  I had never heard about this movie when I was younger, but in high school it began being shown on public television every year in a horribly scratched 16mm version around 11:30 at night.  I wonder how many others found out about the film the same way.  It was especially scary because the picture and sound was so bad it made the ghosts seem even more ominous and terrifying.  My brother and I loved it.  We owned the VHS version and the other DVD version.  This christmas, he bought several copies so each member of the family had his/her own and a friend gave him a copy for himself!  Now that's a Christmas classic!  I was glad to that the film has been given the royal treatment and I will no longer have to endure bad pictures and bad sound.  In fact, the movie is pristine!  The old 1935 British version is included here too.  It is not nearly as good but has some good performances in it and isn't as slick as the MGM version that followed.  I'm so pleased I got this DVD.  You may want to own it too!\n",
      "This is still my favorite version of this wonderful story.  I enjoy the book most of all, but the transformation of Scrooge in this version is so terrific.\n",
      "This is the one and only best version of the Christmas Carol on video. I would highly suggest if you like the Story to purchase this version. You won't regret it.\n",
      "An oldie but a goodie.  Once again a movie I keep on watching over and over again.  Shows we are getting older and melancholy\n",
      "I'm trying to remember the first time I saw this film -- maybe I was 5?  Sitting in the darkened sunroom with my grinning but enthralled older brothers, wanting to look and afraid to look -- trying to hide my terror of the three spirits.  That was over 50 years ago, and I've not seen an adaptation that is better.  The black & white ambience, the haunting oboe melodies in the background, shifting from plaintive to ominous to threatening...and the performances, oh, the performances!  We watched and chanted the lines every year -- an Old English Christmas version of Rocky Horror.  We saw new things and deciphered the meaning of unfamiliar sayings -- Bob's yer uncle!  As new children came along, rules about the proper age for viewing were set, broken, and reinforced when at least one small sprite begged to stay, but later ran from the room in tears.  When it was released on VHS, we all gave one another copies.  We still watch it every year when family gathers -- whether all together or apart in different locations.  It is the ultimate Christmas Carol, and a wonderful family ritual.\n",
      "There are numerous issues and re-issues of the 1951 version of  \"A Christmas Carol\" so why purchase this 2007 VCI release?  To say that this film version of Dickens' story is a classic would be an understatement.  Hailed by most critics as the best of all the versions made over the past 70-odd years, this review need not dwell on whether or not this is a movie worthy of watching; many other reviewers here have said as much.  What has typically not been done in reviews posted here is to give potential purchasers an in-depth analysis of what makes this release a most have (or not) for first time watchers, someone looking for a great Christmas gift, or simply a fan who wants \"The Ultimate Collector's Edition (as this release is advertised).  This review will attempt to cover, not the film itself in much detail - although some aspects will be discussed.  Instead it will focus mainly on the extras and production value present on this release compared to other releases.  Importantly this review WILL NOT simply provide a litany list of 'extras' present on the discs (you can get that at IMDB), but rather will review the content of the extras.  So read on and decide for yourself whether VCI's \"Ultimate Collector's Edition\" is all it's advertised!In a comparative sense it is probably most critical to compare this 2007 (two-disc) VCI release of \"A Christmas Carol\" to VCI's 2004 (one-disc) release of the same movie.  Let's start with a list of features/extras on the 2004 release:- Remastered original B/W version of the 1951 film- Extras: colorized version of the 1951 film- Max Fliesher's Technicolor cartoon Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer (1948, 8 min) [good quality]- Selectable subtitles/narration (English, Spainish, narrative for the blind in English) - Introduction to both B/W and color versions (same intro, narrated by Patrick MacNee, in both cases); Cast & Production Notes (really just cast bios)- Comes with a nice interactive menu- Nice if simple clamshell packaging with 'movie board' insert.Here's what you get with the 2-disc 2007 VCI \"Ultimate Collector's Edition\" with commentary on the 'value' of the features/extras:Disc 1 contains- 4x3 and 16x9 [enhanced for widescreen TVs] B/W (original) version of 1951 film with selectable subtitles (English, Spainish) - buyers should be aware that original release was full screen thus 16x9 version is cropped on top and bottom to make widescreen (essentially vertical version of Pan-Scan to convert WS to FS); The picture quality of the remastered version is splendid.  Improved over 2004 version.  Very few flaws still visible.  Tones are crisp and contrast great.- Audio options (2 channel, 5.1 channel Surround, narration for blind in English - same narration as on 2004 VCI version) - Surround sound - very nice for most part, although tends to 'amplify' noise - audio apparently harder to clean up than the picture. Yet did nice job enhancing certain parts, e.g., when Scrooge gets to his front door (when he sees the first ghost of Marley) we here the wind blow from front left (channel) to rear right; when Scrooge is shown his tombstone by ghost of Christmas future, the music is nice in surround, Scrooge's voice only comes through center front channel - very well done.- Cast bios - much expanded over 2004 version- Audio Commentary by Marcus Hearne (British film/music documentarian) and George Cole (played young Ebenezer Scrooge in the 1951 version) - some interesting insights are provided by Cole about the actors and making of the movie. Hearnes' historical knowledge also provides interesting material and context for Cole's personal recollectionsDisc 2 contains- \"Scrooge\" 1935 version (directed by Henry Edwards, starring Sir Seymour Hicks as Scrooge) - picture is very dark and grainy; this is true of both outside and inside shots.  Nice extra to have but quality not very good.- Colorized version of 1951 movie (same as on 2004 VCI release) with selectable subtitles/narrative (English, Spainish, narrative for blind in English)- Two trailers, one titled \"Scrooge\" and one titled \"A Christmas Carol\" - \"Scrooge\" is very dark in theme and picture tones, music is \"Scrooge theme\" from 1951 movie, whereas \"A Christmas Carol\" is happier and lighter in both theme and picture tone, upbeat Christmas music accompanies- \"The Spirit of Christmas Past\" - Marcus Hearne interviews George Cole about Alastair Sim.  Interview done against blackscreen such resulting in sharp visual contrasts (when Hearne is seen asking questions, he too in against blackscreen), with pictures and clips of Sim interwoven into the interview dialog.  Much of interview not directly about Sim, but rather (appropriately) also about Cole's career (especially when co-staring with Sim in other projects).  Fairly dry interviewer and interviewee, but informative.  [total run time just less than 15 min]- \"Richard Gordon Remembers George Minter & Renown Pictures\" - Gordon helped raise money for making \"A Christmas Carol\" and distributed it in US.  This feature is done entirely as an audio interview of Gordon by Tom Weaver (author and film historian], laid over still photos and film clips of elements being discussed in interview.  Much of the interview is centered on story of how Gordon and Minter formed working relationship (via Renown Pictures).  Gordon tells several stories: Minter's rise as producer/presenter of films; how \"Scrooge\" as made in UK was re-titled \"A Christmas Carol\" for release in US; how picture released in US was not initially hailed, was actually not seen as 'family' movie but more equated to 'horror' movie; how when \"A Christmas Carol\" hit US TV it became a cult hit, but in UK was hit from initial release (Sim was very popular actor in UK at time); tells of other films in which Minter collaborated before and after \"Scrooge\" with considerable discussion of other Minter films (e.g., \"Svengali\" and work with \"Old Mother Riley\" films that were popular in UK). [total run time ~20 min]- \"Charles Dickens, His Life and Times\" - Audio biography accompanied by illustrations and photos.  Discusses Dickens' unpbringing, early relationships, early struggles and later prolific writing career (critically acclaimed), his marriage (to Catherine Hogarth) and affair with Ellen Ternan, and his poor health later in life.- \"Before and After Restoration\" - Not really a 'before and after' comparision as advertised on the clamshell.  Rather a few scenes are shown in split screen comparison but most thus is a discussion of the technical aspects of the restoration process. Like to be of most interest to those with technical savvy [~ 2 min in length].  If the viewer wants a fair comparison of the picture restoration of this 2007 version watch it in comparison to VCI's 2004 release (or previous prior releases).- Photo gallery - stills from the movie, as well as production stills and actor/actress publicity shots.  All images shown in \"Ken Burns effect\" (moving and zooming). Edge of screen is surrounded by a 'snowy' matte.  No audio tracks accompany this extra.All in all this is an excellent 2-disc set sure to be a hit with all fans of the movie.  If you're new to the film version of Dickens' classic pick up THIS release, it's worth the $.  5 solid stars (for movie and extras).\n",
      "This is our favorite version of this story.  It's amuses us to think that Alastair Sim was a comedic actor.  Nice to see this classic all cleaned up from the original film, all the artifacts and such have been eliminated, great transfer to DVD.\n",
      "This version of \"A Christmas Carol\" starring Alastair Sim is the one all versions of the movie are compared against, and for good reason! Sim is the perfect actor for Scrooge. I even like the liberties the producer did with the story, with that delightful scene with Mrs. Dilbert where she thinks Scrooge has gone stark raving mad!I loved the DVD version which has the original B&W; version. (It has the colorized version, too, but I ignored that.) And to my surprise, it has Art Fleischer's cartoon \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" as a bonus. Two classics for the price of one! Well worth having!So, as Tiny Tim says, \"God bless us every one!\"\n",
      "I think everyone can agree that this movie is the ultimate classic Christmas tale.  It's been so many years since I saw this version that I forgot how great a movie it is and worth annual viewings (why don't they run this on tv anymore?).  This is a 2 dvd set edition - the movie and extras.  The movie speaks for itself and the quality is there.  It's all about the extras and plenty of remarkable extras have been provided here: the audio commentary (how did they get this? I wouldn't think they did this at the time so this must have been added much later) is a great addition as is the actor's reminiscence of that time.  Those two were the most compelling for me but there are plenty of others to enjoy.  The only minus with this movie is that it's greatness is NOT appreciated by my kids (not spooky enough and too much talking about life stuff) but maybe one day they will grow to apreciate it.  This movie is a must for the holiday season and I strongly recommend this one as it really is the ultimate collector's edition!\n",
      "Alastair Sim and the entire cast of characters really bring out the pathos of this story. Kathleen Harrison as Scrooge's maid is delightful. Excellent story telling comes into play especially during the visit from the Ghost of Christmas Past, when we discover the person Jacob Marley and the spirits were sent to save. It truly is worth watching any time of year!\n",
      "Alistor simms.  Best scrooge ever.  we all know this story.  Love itThanks for the fast shipping ect.............\n",
      "There are many version of the story on film, but this is (in my opinion) still the best. The story, the setting and the context work better in this version. The acting is all first rate and the sets seem very true to the era. What I especially like in this version is that it gives a fuller depth to Scrooge himself. The character just seems more real here than most versions.\n",
      "I just got my copy today, and put it in after watching the Blu Ray of Forrest Gump. Trust me. You've never seen A Christmas Carol until you see this new Blu Ray. I was shocked and beside myself at how well this new restoration turned out. The detail is unreal, especially for a film that has always looked so bad. It's not flawless mind you, with the ocassional nick and scratch, but overall this is a beautiful transfer and worth every penny for an upgrade. The sound is quite nice as well. I prefer the original mono to the 5.1 track. Very clear and hiss free.\n",
      "Classic film about the classic book \"Christmas Carol\" by Victorian era/Industrial era writer Charles Dickens.  Of all the film versions of this book, this film comes closest to the book version.  It is the only film version that shows the Jacob Marley character during his lifetime.  Marley was Scrooge's business partner and his only friend for a period of time.  This movie, shown in black and white, which was standard at the time, is probably the best of the film versions of \"Christmas Carol.\"\n",
      "I received my copy of the 60th Anniversary set today via Amazon (and kudos to Amazon, which refunded me a total of $7 from the pre-order price I had paid back on Oct 2, charging me a mere $10.99 for this 2-disc set, ie: at their Nov 2 price).I haven't watched the entire movie, but spot checks of the film on the BluRay disc reveal the best-ever VCI transfer. It's even better than the BluRay version that was released in 2009. Also, it seems to me like the picture contains more along the edges than it has before. I'm wondering if VCI has been clipping the left & right sides of the film image all these years due to deterioration, but were somehow able to restore those edges with the new computer software they said they used on the film this time around. I did notice that a restoration credit is given to a firm called \"Blair & Associates\" that isn't VCI, with a copyright date of 2011. Perhaps they finally decided to send the thing out of house and get it done right.I can't imagine why VCI isn't hawking this version more aggressively, because it does seem to fulfill - finally - the promises VCI has made over the years about just how painstaking their restoration efforts have been. Those promises have always led to a bit of disappointment in the past. Not this time.Also, the soundtrack is absolutely quiet, at least when played in the original mono. I haven't tried the 5.1 surround sound yet, and I don't know that I will. I'm something of a purist in this matter.I watched the Leonard Maltin intro, and it was very good and professional, supplying info I didn't know (such as the fact that Glynis Johns is the daughter of Mervyn Johns, who plays Bob Cratchet).I have only ONE very small complaint, and it seems almost ridiculous to point out, but the subtitles come up a second or so before the lines are actually delivered on the screen. They're not synced precisely to the beginning of each new phrase in the dialogue. That's really not a problem as I never watch the entire film with subtitles. At least these subtitles are in white, rather than the hard-to-read red of the Ultimate DVD Edition. And, the point size of the subtitles is a bit smaller than it was on the 2009 BluRay version.The set also includes a hardcopy \"Abridged American Pressbook\" that I assume represents what was sent out to American film houses when the film was released in 1951. It's a very nice touch, and something that I haven't seen in earlier releases. The little booklet is a 3-page gate fold that unfolds into a two-sided promo kit that pictures the posters and lobby posters that were available to promote the film. I especially love the tie-in promotion to the Classics Illustrated \"Volume 53,\" \"A Christmas Carol.\" Fascinating stuff!I did not know that the film was retitled from \"Scrooge\" to \"A Christmas Carol\" for its initial US release. Hey, I'm learning all the time!I watched a couple of the bonus features on Saturday, and they are well done and supply interesting information.Edited 12/7/11: I watched this BD in its entirety last night, and it is just amazing how clean and, well, wonderful it all is. The picture is rock steady, except when there are fades moving from one scene to another, ie: movement that appeared from Day One on this film and was usual for films made in this period. What you won't see is the picture nervously moving off its axis. It is as solid as if it were done digitally. The detail and depth to the picture is the best I have ever seen on this film. And, yes, that reaction shot from Fred's wife that was missing from the UCE has been restored. Less than a second and a half of film, but oh so meaningful.The sound is also remarkable. What's nice is that almost all of the old-movie static has been effectively removed, so the voices and the film score register beautifully. I first watched with the original mono track playing, and it is very fulsome and vivid. I later went back and watched the entire movie in surround sound. Funny, but the surround process seems to be less-clean than the mono track! The movie sounds its age more in surround than in mono. That said, the orchestral score registers more effectively in surround, and that's important, as the musical score for this film is one of its glories. And, yes, I noticed that total sound drop out in the scene where Scrooge visits Fred for Xmas dinner in the surround track. The drop out lasts about 4 seconds. Very unfortunate.Still, definitely worth getting.\n",
      "We cherish A Christmas Carol as a family.  We thought we had seen every legit version on filmlIttle did we know that this is the definitive versionso much so that I catalyzed my rereading of the original - slowly and with much greater enjoymentperhaps having just turned 65 was a contributing factorNever the less - for the ages\n",
      "You cannot go wrong with this version.  I watch it at least once per year.\n",
      "There has been many remakes of this classic tale of Scrooge, However this is the best of the lot. NO one tops Alister Simms, this is a timeless classic. I have been watching this version with my wife every Christmas eve for the last 21 years, Christmas just isnt Christmas without watching this movie, and now they even give you a colorized version with the classic black and white which I prefer, just cant get myself to watch this in color.\n",
      "I'm very disappointed because when I picked this version Emerald Edition) of the movie, the customer reviews said it was a two-DVD set with a colorized version and an enhanced black and white version. The product I received, had just one DVD. Another review (same product) said there were two versions of the movie - one with Alistair Sim and the other with George C. Scott. I see Sim (my favorite) but there is no Scott!  I paid $19 for this product and am guessing I could have got the same thing (different cover but same reviews) for $9.96.  When I read the reviews for the $9.96 version, it had exactly the same reviews as the $19 version.  I think the problem is that Amazon is getting lazy with the product details and the customer reviews.  How can you reuse the same customer reviews for different products.  I don't understand. I've trusted Amazon for years; now I'm starting to feel gyped.Will AMAZON read this and respond?\n",
      "This is the best version of the classic movie. Well cast, well acted, great special edition. Highly recommended. A good buy.\n",
      "Nothing beats this original version. We can't find it any longer on TV over the holidays so decided it was time to just buy it!\n",
      "This is a much watch every Christmas!  It makes us all think about how we treat people and where our values are.\n",
      "A Christmas Carol became a huge hit almost as soon as Dickens wrote it and has remained a classic ever since. Is there any movie that has been remade so many times and in so many ways? From more recent versions with George C Scott, or even more recent with Patrick Stewart to children's version with the Muppets or even Mr. Magoo to musicals to other derivative versions like Scrooged and American Christmas Carol, few stories are as enduring as that of the curmudgeonly Scrooge and his ghostly visitations. This surely is one of the best of the traditional movie versions. Alastair Sim is absolutely believable as Scrooge, from beginning to the very end, hitting all the right emotional notes along the way. Getting to play the restored B&W; version on my large widescreen TV is truly a delight, one can really get immersed in the story and the wonderful acting without grainy old images and crackling sound track getting in the way. Being able to listen to an audio commentary on a 50+ year old movie was certainly extraordinary! I've always been a fan of commentaries and it's amazing the recollections that they provided us with. An additional track for the blind is certainly an interesting, and I'm sure for visually impaired people, a very welcome addition.Going to the second disk, we have the often lamented colorized version. While like most I do prefer the original B&W; I do often enjoy watching colorized movies once in awhile. My grandfather often colorized photos and many of my favorite photos of my mother are ones that he colored and watching old colorized movies somewhat reminds me of them. The additional features and interviews on this disk have some interest....the before & after on the restoration is kind of neat. I think I will enjoy the interviews more in the future, they became a little much after already being through the audio commentary on the movie. Getting another edition of \"Christmas Carol\" was a neat bonus, but would have been much nicer if that movie had been restored as well.Overall, this is a truly wonderful movie, well worth the purchase price, and full of wonderful features and bonuses that will surely be enjoyed for years to come.\n",
      "We love this version of \"A Christmas Carol\" above all others.  It is so real and so well done by Alastair Sim that we usually watch this one only now at Christmas time.  It is a family tradition!  Great film!\n",
      "This is without a doubt the finest version of the Dicken's classic I have ever viewed. And with the extras included on the DVD it makes it even better. Includes the colorized version as well as the classic black and white. I watched them both and loved both of them.\n",
      "I've always loved this movie and made a Christmas tradition of watching it every year on the old copy that I made. It's nice to have a new clearer version to watch. The HD version is great. The blue ray version is a little strange looking so I just watch the hd version.\n",
      "My wife and I love this version of Scrooge. We watch it all year round, if its in keeping with the situation!\n",
      "In this 1951 version of \"A Christmas Carol\", Scrooge is portrayed by the very brilliant British actor Alastair Sim.Sim brings the character of Scrooge to life by providing viewers with an honest performance of how a person so rich, cheap, and grumpy can transform into a cheerful, giving, and overall caring individual.  Also, Sim's facial expressions of disbelief and impatience are extremely funny and offer a humorous side to a rather serious and interesting story.  Furthermore, Sim's ability to practically become the character of Scrooge by digging into Scrooge's emotions is what really makes his performance stand out.Overall, this film is fantastic and has always been one of my favorite Christmas movies to watch.  The DVD is so clear and you must watch this movie in black and white.  The color version is very artificial and takes away from the dark scenes such as Marley's appearance before Scrooge.Don't hesitate to buy the DVD if you're thinking about it.  It's great and well worth preserving in your movie collection.Note: This DVD is a one disc and double sided.  One side is the color version, and the other the black and white version.\n",
      "I also grew up with this version.  It is certainly the best.  First of it was produced in Great Britain.  No offense, to Hollywood, but that makes a difference for this story.  Secondly, what makes Sims such a great Scrooge is he plays a believable \"Redeemed Scrooge\".  This is really the most difficult part of the character.  It's easy to play the mean scrooge.  Sims, however, really comes across as believably transformed.  And not just a buffoon, like most other actors who have portrayed the character.\n",
      "Viewing this particular version is a tradition in our family--my earliest memories include watching this at my grandparents' home in the 'big city' (they had a tv--we lived on a farm & had no tv). One of the interesting things is that my grandparents were Ukrainian immigrants who did indeed prosper in Canada, but never forgot their humble beginnings.  Their home was always filled with scents of good food, laughter, song, and lively conversation. Christmas was a very important time for family & friends, and they did indeed 'keep Christmas well', one of the lessons I have since learned. This film has not lost its relevance in this 21st century world. While the special effects in the 1951 version may seem very simple to many, relative to the period, the film was well-done.  \"God bless us, everyone\".\n",
      "This version is my favorite, and I can't imagine another one topping it. Alistair Sim does a fabulous job, and the other characters are also great. Tiny Tim is a little schmaltzy, as Tiny Tims usually are.It's got my favorite \"Marley's Ghost\", and I enjoy the music in it as well.You can't go wrong with this one if  you like the story.\n",
      "THIS IS THE BEST CHRISTMAS MOVIE EVER MADE.  COLORIZED VERSION BRINGS OUT ALL THE DETAILS YOU MISS IN BLACK AND WHITE. ALISTAIR SIM IS PERFECT AS SCROOGE.\n",
      "I watch this movie every year. I finally had to buy it on DVD. My old VCR finally bit the dust. This movie stays true to the Charles Dickens book. Well worth the money spent. Alastair Sim  is a very convincing Scrooge.\n",
      "When growing up outside of Chicago, WGN or PBS would air this classic every Christmas. My dad would watch it and of course I would watch it with him, but being scared out my wits when Marely showed up, when I 5 years-old.Recently I bought the new 2-disc ultimate Christmas Carol from VCI and I must congratulate them on an excellent transfer. The picture has no scratches or dirt, but there are few bright white spots in the film, but its 56 years old. The sound is awesome. Sure the 5.1 surround doesn't really work with all the talking, but once the orchestra kicks in, its like they are playing in your house.If you own a previous copy, its worth the upgrade for the sound and picture alone, but the special features are not the best and the commentary will make you fall asleep.\n",
      "The movie was excellent I was so glad I found it!!It arrived quickly. Thank you for the excellent service.\n",
      "It doesn't have to be Christmas to enjoy this absolute wonder of a film (although it will quickly become an indispensable part of your Christmas tradition)! Alistair Sim IS Scrooge -- everyone else can just give it up at this point. His Scrooge is miserly and misanthropic, of course, but he also lets you see that he has come to his soul affliction by bad judgment and poor circumstance, not a lack of heart. You feel that his pain and loneliness are real and, therefore, rejoice that much more at his redemption. As the reviews have said, this movie is light on special effects but rich in spirit. In fact, the scene of Scrooge awakening on Christmas morning (especially his bit with Mrs. Dilber) may be some of the finest acting ever captured on film. If you haven't given this version of \"A Christmas Carol\" a try yet, buy it -- if it doesn't bring a tear to your eye, you might want to check your pulse!\n",
      "we have the vhs and noticed the images are darker than original so i bought the dvd and hope to watch it for years to come\n",
      "\"A Christmas Carol\" is a beautiful story invoking the true spirit of life.  The entreaty to love each other and to give freely without selfish expectations are universal truths invoking God's own spirit as He gave His Son for us all, (John 3:16).  This movie version of Dickens classic tale of the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge stays extremely close to the original.  The acting is unsurpassed, and Alistair Simms shines as Scrooge.  His performance is more convincing than any I have ever seen, and his giddy transformation at the end of the film had me laughing for joy along with him.  The supporting cast is equally wonderful.  I especially loved this film's treatment of the character of Tiny Tim.  The boy is cheerful and sweet without being overly dramatic or syrupy.  His gentle spirit is truly endearing.  I also loved the depiction of the Ghost of Christmas Present.  His jollity is contageous, yet the scene depicting the miserable children, (Want and Ignorance), who cling to the spirit, is heartrenching and emotionally jarring.Please give this wonderfully unforgettable film a chance.  Happy viewing, and God bless you all.\n",
      "What a beautiful copy of this movie i picked it because it was clear and the quality of the song and picture is excellent not to mention the price too!\n",
      "Best Christmas movie ever. Two DVD's with color version and B&W. Added bonus of a 1935 version in B&W. Lots of extras including interview with the actor who portrayed Scrooge as a young man. Love it.\n",
      "It's A Wonderful Life (Two-Disc Collector's Set) (B/W & Color)Wonderfuf,heartwaming film.  Alister Sim is the perfect Scroodge.\n",
      "Tthis is a classic movie. The black & white version made it even that much more enjoyable. I rated it 5 stars because that's what it is, in my opinion.\n",
      "There have been many Christmas carols released over the years, including one filmed in 1936 by MGM and starring Reginald Owen. That film, though servicable as a reasonably faithful adaptation of Dicken's immortal story, is merely a pale reflection of the emotional depth and stylistic power provided by this brilliant version starring the great English actor, Alastair Sim. Director Brian Desmond Hurst creates an intense, emotionally driven, noirish atmosphere in which Scrooge is confronted by several shocks from his past (the death of his sister, the loss of his only love, his troubled view of his nephew, his complicity in the demise of his first employer's, Mr. Fezziwig's, business). These shocks allow Scrooge's conversion to a kinder, gentler Scrooge to acquire a much greater resonance: it is true redemption. It simply makes more sense when the raw human clay is a real man and not 2-dimensional cardboard.Given Scrooge's loveless past, we begin to understand Scrooge as a character. Sympathy replaces the simplistic hatred of a caricature that too many retellings of this story evoke. Sim's performance is simply stunning. No performance of Scrooge duplicates the sheer emotional range provided by Sim. The rest of the cast is equally superb. This is a quintessentially English story and it merits an English production. All aspects of this production, from script to set design, acting to direction, are at the highest levels of excellence. You owe it to yourself to see this splendid, unforgettable production. And see it in its atmospheric, beautifully filmed black and white version:  the way it was filmed, the way it was meant to be seen. Highest possible recommendation.Mike Birman\n",
      "I watched three different versions of A Christmas Carol during the holidays. The one starring Alastair Sim is by far the best. This Christmas classic should have a place in every dvd collection.\n",
      "For anyone who likes the old versions of this movie this is great. The remastering of this movie is excellent. It is so nice to see this as it was supposed to be seen. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the old movies.\n",
      "There must be something in the British soil that produces such wonderful character actors. The redemption scene at the end may be the best 5 minutes in movie history.\n",
      "First off, I am a great fan of all Charles Dickens works but I'm particularly fond of \"A Christmas Carol\". I probably own just about every filmed version of this classic that one can obtain. Of all the versions,(and there are many) this one starring Alastair Sim is far and away the best I've ever seen. Sim's performance is incomparable and brilliant! So much so, that it will be difficult to watch the other films after you've seen this one. (That's saying a lot. The one starring George C. Scott was quite good.)This release includes the magnificently restored B&W; original version, a colorized version of the original, and as a bonus, an earlier B&W; film version starring Seymour Hicks!(...gasp...I can hardly go on...). It also includes some other bonus material I've not seen in any edition such as the \"Richard Gordon Remembers Minter and Renown Pictures\". I'll not restate the all the bonus description here but I will say that while it's not a lavish production, it IS truly fascinating as well as informative.If you are not a fan, why not buy this release and get the most for your money?If you are a fan, it is an ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE. There is so much in this release to appreciate I can't possibly put it into this review. Unless a better edition is released, this is truly the ultimate edition.Alright...alright...I'll say it...\"God bless us, everyone...\"--May Christmas always be in your heart.***********UPDATE**********After reading other reviewer comments, I felt an update was in order.My favorite scene in the entire film begins with no dialogue at all. It's when Scrooge arrives at his nephew Fred's house for Christmas dinner after his transformation. He's ashamed and perhaps a little fearful of how he'll be received, so he pauses at the drawing room doors, unable to open them, and looks back over his shoulder as if for approval. The maid who is watching, gently smiles and nods, offering Scrooge the encouragement he needs to go in. An awful lot of humanity passes between the two, yet not a word. Scrooge goes in and after some initial shock is gaily greeted by his nephew Fred.It is here that a reviewer has noted that a reaction shot of Fred's wife has been deleted. This is true. In the old version, Fred opens his mouth in astonishment and then exclaims, \"Uncle Ebenezer!\", as he hops up and goes to greet him. During his exclamation, the camera is actually on Fred's wife for 1 1/2 seconds. She says nothing, but has a look of bewilderment on her face. In the restored version, Fred's exclamation begins as soon as Fred opens his mouth, making the audio very slightly out of sync with the picture so they could cut the 1 1/2 second shot of Fred's wife and not lose the audio. However, just after that, Fred turns to his wife and says, \"My dear, look who it is!\". At this point in the old version, we see the exact same 1 1/2 second shot of Fred's wife repeated. We also see this shot in the restored version as well. So, the old version shows the same 1 1/2 second shot two times, while the restored version shows it only once.Minor, but do I wish VCI hadn't done this? --- YES!Another reviewer noted that there's an audio dropout of Scrooge's fearful scream when the door flies open when Marley's ghost appears. This is also true. Although, I suspect that this is not an artifact of burning the discs. I think it's a deletion.Again, minor --- but I can't even begin to imagine why.The overall restoration, in my humble opinion, outweighs these very minor \"edits?\". Fortunately, they're not numerous and are not major enough to ruin the film. Honestly, though, editing should be left to the directors. When \"RESTORERS\" make edits they go beyond their purview as restorers of the film. The color version, which is included, has not undergone the same processing so you still have the unrestored original film version to watch. You could even turn down the color on your TV and watch it in B&W; if you feel you must.I gave the FILM 5 stars and that certainly still stands. I suppose I'd give the restoration 4 1/2 stars.---May the Christmas Spirit be always in your heart!\n",
      "There is a reason why this version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL is considered by almost everyone to be the definitive version. It is not because of great special effects or production values (at least, not if we are to judge by the crew member whom we glimpse briefly in the mirror in Scrooge's bedroom near the end). It is not because it is the most faithful adaptation of Dickens, nor because of any visual splendor, nor because it is the most \"fun\" version for a family curl up with on Christmas Eve. It is because of Alastair Sim's magnificent, endearing portrayal of Ebenezer Scrooge. Sim makes Scrooge a three-dimensional person, not a cardboard cutout. He imbues the character with depth and richness, from his bitterness towards the world to his horror upon meeting the ghosts to his giddy euphoria on Christmas day. Sim was primarily a comic actor, and it shows; he makes Scrooge hilariously funny at times (such as, ironically, during Marley's death scene). Scrooge's transformation at the end is utterly believable because Sim throughout the film lets us see glimpses of the goodness and good humor that have been buried in Scrooge's heart for so many years by bitter experience and which are just waiting to come out. That scene where Scrooge joyfully scampers about the room after awakening from his dream is absolutely cathartic in Sim's hands.All right, maybe I have slighted the other components of the film. It presents the true, bleak Dickensian vision of Victorian London; it is as far from a \"picture postcard\" CHRISTMAS CAROL as you can get. It is amazingly economical, compressing the story into barely 90 minutes and presenting it in a bare, brisk, unsentimental fashion, almost like a gritty documentary. There is real horror and dread in this movie (one example: when Scrooge ascends the staircase in his house) and I can just imagine how frightening these moments must have been on the big screen. All the embellishments to the Dickens story are entirely apt. And it boasts a fine musical score by Richard Addinsell, which is now available on CD. Treat yourself this Christmas to the definitive version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL (and in the original black and white, please; this is one of those movies that color absolutely ruins).\n",
      "I bought these movies as a gift to my husband.  This is his favorite adaption of Scrooge and he loved them.  They arrived well before the date and in mint condition.\n",
      "This is the best version of the Christmas Carol.Alister Sim makes the most provactive and animated Scrooge.It creates a mood that takes you on Scrooge's journey.A family favorite even though it is a older version of theChristmas Carol.  A classic !\n",
      "We had this on VHS for the longest time because, for the longest time, the DVD wasn't available online.  Clarity and sound are just terrific AND......THERE'S NO REWINDING!!!!\n",
      "Love to watch this movie every year in December.Kind of gets you in the mood and proper perspective for the upcoming New Year!Enjoy!\n",
      "This Christmas Carol is pure joy (as is the version by George C. Scott). The transfer to DVD is excellent; the sound is excellent.Anyone interested in this movie will find the special features to be fascinating.\n",
      "I am 60 years old and this version played on TV each Christmas eve before bed when I was a kid. Never plays on TV anymore, was afraid it was lost. No commentary on the quality as I have to receive it yet, just that it is available.\n",
      "Alistair Sim is the only true Scrooge. And this movie cannot be beat by any other renditions. This movie is the most chillingly effective version. This restored version makes the entertainment that much better. So do be a Scrooge. Buy this movie and you won't be visited by ghosts of your wrong doings.\n",
      "This is the best version of the Scrooge story ever on film.  I watched it every Christmas Eve since I was about 10 yrs.  I didn't watch the color version.  Some films are best viewed in B/W.  Had to finally buy it since it hasn't been on TV in our area for 2 years.\n",
      "When one talks about the great classic horror films, the names\"Frankenstein\" and \"Dracula\" often pop up, or even \"Robert Mitchum.\"  But the classic 1951 A CHRTISTMAS CAROL, starring the unforgettable Alastair Sim, can be seen as one of the great horror films of the silver screen.  It has all the elements of a good scare story: it's actually about three spirits who frighten Ebenezer Scrooge out of his suicidal lifestyle, to bring him back into the world of the living.  This particular film takes the story seriously, so that we don't see any songs or comedy sidekicks or anything of that sort.  The film itself is framed in the style of the classic horror movies and German expressionist films, with masterful use of shadows and music to build up suspense.For example, look at the scene where Scrooge comes home and sees Jacob Marley's image on his door knocker.  He enters his home, when he thinks that someone is following him...and in the space of a few seconds, he becomes concerned, the nervous, then frightened, as he rushes up the stairs.  The music at this moment is an ominious bass, which combines with the eerie shadows of the stairwell and banister to give this scene a \"feel\" that moves the audience and makes them uneasy...in precisely the same style as the great horror films.  Likewise with the next scene, where Scrooge hears someone dragging chains up the stairs, and he becomes more apprehensive - until suddenly the door to his room is hurled open, and he cries out in fear.  Even though we, the viewers, are so used to horror film stereotypes that we know the door is going to open, we are *still* caught off-guard by Scrooge's sudden panic.There are tortured spirits, cinematic horror tricks of darkness and lighting (most notably when the Ghost of Christmas Future takes Scrooge to the site of his own grave), and a lingering feeling of sadness...most of all because we are seeing the life of a lonely man who is too afraid of the world to come out and let himself feel for others, even to the point of losing the woman he loves.  But in the end, the spirits work their miracle, and Scrooge is returned to the land of the living.  We feel this movie in our hearts...but also in our nerves, as this CHRISTMAS CAROL uses the techniques of the horror film to affect us.This is one reason why the 1951 version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL is still the greatest CHRISTMAS CAROL of all: it is a true horror movie.\n",
      "This DVD arrived quickly and was of the best quality one could expect from a film made this long ago.Alastair Sim is a pure delight as Scrooge, and the rest of the cast is just as good. It is a tradition in my home to watch this every Christmas Eve. My children love it and it  conveys the true meaning of Christmas perfectly. Hey, you might even get your children to love reading Charles Dickens after they see this film. Pure perfection!\n",
      "In 19th century London, cold-hearted miser Ebenezer Scrooge gets a Christmas Eve visit from the ghost of his deceased business partner, Jacob Marley. Marley's visit heralds three more, the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future, all to come that night in turn. The goal of the spirits is to reform Scrooge in order to save him from Marley's fate: an afterlife of unrest bearing heavy chains of remorse. They seek to accomplish this by showing Scrooge select moments from his life and the lives of those he affects, as have been, are, and will be, from Christmases long past to those yet to come. Scrooge witnesses how his lonely boyhood changed to happiness, but soon turned cold with growing greed, anger, loss, and distrust. He sees the plight of London's poor and destitute and how he ever turned a bind eye to them, and witnesses the love he lost in his pursuit of an idle fortune. Nothing, however, is as disturbing as those images of Christmases yet to come. Can these emotional visions work their magic in time to save Ebenezer Scrooge's soul?Presented in this new, 2-disc DVD set is probably the world's favorite version of \"A Christmas Carol,\" the 1951 British film (known as \"Scrooge\" in England) starring the magnificent Alastair Sim. As a great fan of the various film versions of \"A Christmas Carol,\" from those starring human actors to ones featuring the likes of Yosemite Sam, Kermit the Frog, and Mickey Mouse, I have to confess that this is probably the best, and it had been years since I'd seen it! Most versions of Charles Dickens' classic Christmas tale have something special that sets them apart and makes them worthy of the holiday film lover's home library, and I think one of the best aspects of this version is the depth the film takes us into Scrooge's past, something barely touched upon in the 1935 version included as a bonus in this set. Adding to the touchingly real and thorough look into Scrooge's history is the excellent casting of George Cole as the young incarnation of Ebenezer. He bears a fine resemblance to Alastair Sim, and both are wonderful in the role. It makes the flashbacks all the more believable. The rest of the ensemble cast is also excellent, featuring great British character actors like Hermione Baddeley and Mervyn Johns, who play the struggling Cratchits, and Michael Hordern, who plays Jacob Marley. Directed beautifully by Brian Desmond Hurst, the excellent restoration job done for this release makes it look better than ever in glorious black and white! Of course, you also can watch the unrestored, colorized version if you have a mind to, and there's even a mock widescreen version of the restored film included for folks who want the picture to fill up their modern, wide-style screens.As for the bonuses, Disc One includes the aforementioned regular and enhanced widescreen versions of the newly restored, black and white film, along with text cast bios, English and Spanish subtitle options, an optional narrative track for the blind, and an audio commentary by Marcus Hearn and actor George Cole. The audio commentary may seem a bit dry to American ears and the film isn't discussed all that much (more attention is focused on the careers of George Cole, Alastair Sim, and other cast members), but it's a welcome extra nonetheless. Disc Two features the colorized version of the film, which is unrestored and seems to be taken from a TV airing, including opening and closing host segments (which are rather nice, picture quality aside) by \"Avengers\" star Patrick MacNee (who has a small role in the film as young Jacob Marley). Now, most of us film buffs don't think much of colorization, however, I can see a bit of nostalgia to it now, being amongst the many who grew up during the period when TV presentations of holiday classics often were shown that way. Also on Disc Two are the audio options from the first disc (minus the commentary) and some other fine extras as well! We receive the original British and American theatrical trailers, a brief look at the restoration process for the black and white version of the film, a Photo and Press Book gallery (which runs on its own, something I rather appreciate, though some accompanying music would have been nice), a fine and rapid yet thorough look at the life and times of Charles Dickens, an interview with George Cole on the subject of Alastair Sim titled \"Spirit of Christmas Past,\" an audio interview with Richard Gordon on the subject of Renown Pictures and \"Scrooge\" producer George Minter, and, most delightfully, the 1935 Seymour Hicks version of \"Scrooge.\" The only disappointment here is that the bonus film of Seymour Hicks' \"Scrooge,\" an excellent film in its own right, is not complete. I noticed one of its sweetest moments, the scene at the end where Ebenezer joins the Cratchits in church, was not there. This left me wondering what else might have been cut out, if anything, and deciding I would definitely be keeping my bargain bin edition of that film.Nevertheless, this 2-disc release from VCI, complete with lovely, opening flap slipcover, is the finest presentation of Alastair Sim's \"A Christmas Carol\" to date, and if you love this film and holiday films in general, you owe it to yourself to get it right away!\n",
      "This turned out to be another eat version of A Christmas Carol. My husband has quite a collection of them now!\n",
      "This is quite simply the greatest screen version of Charles Dicken's masterpiece. Indeed it is a masterpiece in it's own right.When I grew up I started searching for versions of the folk song \"Barbara Allen\" and it is because of the scene in this movie when Scrooge musters the courage to go to his nephew's home for Christmas dinner. That scene is one of my favorites in all moviedom.\n",
      "When I was a child growing up in New York, a local tv channel played this version of Christmas Carol at midnight on Christmas eve...and it was so good that we all stayed up to watch it, year after year.  The haunting music, the incredible acting (Alistair Sim is brilliant), and the beautifully nuanced black and white photography make this a perfect movie.\n",
      "Good price and service, I couldn't find any of the old Christmas Carol movies on TV during the holidays so I bought two of my own.\n",
      "This version is fantastic!!! The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the bonus 1935 version of \"Scrooge\" on disc 2. It is the short 59 minute version instead of the complete 78 minute version. It too is a classic IMHO and they should have used the complete version for this otherwise magnificent 2 disc set for the holidays.\n",
      "We are so lucky to be able to see this once drab b/w movie in now beautiful accurate living color.  The folks at VCI have hit a home run in releasing this Christmas classic in beautiful living color.  Refuse to watch anything b/w until it's been beautifully colorfied, the way all b/w films and TV shows should be.  VCI, start colorizing the rest of your b/w features and I'll buy them too.  This is the best of the Christmas Carol movies, and now that it's in beautiful color it's now worth watching even more.  LOVE THOSE BEAUTIFUL LIVING COLORIZED movies, keep it up, now all my dreams will be answered if we can only see \"Holiday Inn\" In Color!!!  Wow, now that's my fantasy come true.  Color all my dreams and all those old drab b/w movies too.\n",
      "The hardships that I and others suffer, are, for a time, set aside while I enjoy this master piece.This work, is true ART.\n",
      "I have watched this black and white version and loved it, seeing it in colour was fantastic, will show it to my grandchildren every Christmas from now on.\n",
      "This is simply the best film version of A Christmas Carol ever made.  To me, Alastair Sim is the quintessential Scrooge and no Christmas season is complete without our traditional viewing of this film.  Every household should have a copy and be sure to watch it, together, to get into the proper caring mood for the holidays each December.\n",
      "I love all the Christmas Carol movies, and when I found this one on Amazon, which I had not seen since I was a kid I had to buy it. It arrived on time and it was a great quality movie. I have already recommended this movie to several friends and they also have purchase it.\n",
      "Of all the many versions of \"A Christmas Carol\" now available on video, this one is the defining one:  it isn't necessarily the most accurate recreation of the Dickens story, but I think it surpasses it in what it is teaching us.  Alistair Sim is not a cartoon or caricature but a chillingly realistic Scrooge in his \"before\" incarnation, and his transformation is more profound and complete, into his wonderfully warm and touchingly humorous \"after\" character.  Avoid the colorized version -- the gloomy mood is best captured in black and white.\n",
      "Alstair Sim is the best Scrooge. I have seen Reginald Owen and turned it right off. One error I want to correct is in referring to Patrick MacNee, he was Scrooge's nephew not young Jacob Marley.He is seen in the scene where Fred comes to the office and wishes his Uncle a Merry Christmas. We see him again when he shows up at Fred's home. In a version he hosted on TV, he talks about the movie. Look for it on broadcast TV during the Christmas Season. Even though in the version I am reviewing includes a colorized version, thanks to Ted Turner, who ruined other Black and White classics,that is not how true movie buffs like myself perfer to watch it.\n",
      "a phenomenal movie weather in black and white or color the performance and the acting is very moving it is a timeless treasure that I love to watch all throughout the year\n",
      "This version of A Christmas Carol is the very best.  A steller cast - Allister Sim IS Scrooge.  This should be in every home.The characters, the costumes, the setting - all perfect.  The values this story teaches are excellent - it is a story that really makesone think.  Schools  would do well by their students to show this movie in classes!\n",
      "This is the one \"Scrooge\" that I HAVE to watch every Christmas! It's a classic film, telling a classic story, and the adaptation is brilliant and near flawless. Alastair Sim gives an amazing performance, and all the other actors are gems, especially Kathleen Harrison as Mrs. Dilber, and Mervyn Johns as Bob Crachit. Michael Hordern is a superb Marley's Ghost, wailing and screaming enough to terrify Scrooge to shivering. The music is also an enormous asset, written by Richard Addinsell, and perfect for the film. See the film in black and white, turn on the original mono sound, and set it to the original 4x3 aspect ratio. Don't watch the widescreen version which crops the top and bottom of the original frame. They also have a 5.1 soundtrack, which is a false 5.1, and it should only be listened to in the original mono sound.\n",
      "The best of all the movies.  Alastair Sim is a great actor and makes Scrooge come to life.  I've probably seen the movie at least a dozen times and still enjoy every minute of it.  I highly recommend this Scrooge over all he others.  Enjoy it!\n",
      "It's very good but I like other versions better.  I have about 3 versions and have seen this one on TV.  They are all basically the same.\n",
      "The 2012 release was very good. A family film to be remembered. The DVD arrived quickly without any problems. The DVD itself is clear with exceptional color.\n",
      "I love the original Christmas Carol with Alastair Sim.  I wanted to have this DVD so I could watch it whenever I wanted.  It seems like they show it less and less every year, and I have been disappointed with the previous year, as they didn't show it at all.  I love the black and white version, and there's also a colorized version, very well done, I might add.  They have an old old version of a Christmas Carol on this DVD, and that was an added plus.  It starred Sir Seymour Hicks, and I think it was about 1932.  Alastair Sim played a wonderful Scrooge, and I think he's the best by far.  I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who loved A Christmas Carol.\n",
      "Very good purchase. As easy as driving to the store and finding it there at a good price. Fun movie - love the transformation on Alistairs face.\n",
      "When I and my fraternal twin sister were young children, I remember staying up to watch this version and the one starring Reginald Owen. I could be wrong, but I think the Sim version was shown first, then Owen's, then Sim's again. They were both part of my growing-up years and I still enjoy them. When my sister gave this one to me for Christmas in the colorized version I wasted no time in putting it on. To watch again Ebeneezer refusing to allow his clerk to put more coal on the fire, or to exchange Christmas greetings with his nephew brougth back all the memories of this timeless classic. To hear again the loud shrieks of the ghost of Jacob Marley to prove to Ebeneezer he was not a figment of the man's imagination was very effective. To watch the crowds of other unhappy spirits and listen to their wailings was more sad than frightening. Each spirit visited Ebeneezer to show him the folly of his miserly ways and in the end he was a changed man. It was so heart-warming to see him giving his housekeeper a guinea for a Christmas present and a hug to boot. To watch Tiny Tim walk again (something omitted from the Owen's version) was a miracle. I feel those who have not seen any of the versions of Dickens' classic which I myself have never read are missing out on a lot, including a look at how old England celebrated Christmas. Now that I have it on DVD the magic can unfold at any time I feel like watching it, and hope it is added to many others' DVD libraries.\n",
      "I love this Christmas story of redemption.  I think I own just about every good production of \"A Christmas Carol\".  Be sure to watch the B&W version as the director intended it to look.\n",
      "My sisters and I always watched this on Christmas Eve and it definitely reminds us of the true meaning of the holiday season.  Alastair Sim is wonderful as Ebenezer Scrooge and the old black and white film adds to the erie feeling as he is visited by the ghosts of Christmas.  The holidays aren't the same without this classic!\n",
      "Great cd with the original verison plus Many Many extras, have looked for this movie for a long time as I think it's the best. Price was great, shipping very fast.\n",
      "Don't bother with any other version, this is the only one you need. Sim simply IS Ebeneezer Scrooge and his transformation is total while remaining totally believable.\n",
      "The best portrail of Scrooge, close to the book in looks, sound and feel.\n",
      "This version with Alastair Sim is, in my mind, the best. I had it on tape but, needed th DVD version.\n",
      "Of all the truly fine actors who have played Scrooge, Alastair Sim nails the role.This is my favorite version and I watch it on my birthday, Christmas Eve. It surpasses the religious message in teaching how to live the purposeful life.\n",
      "Alastair Sim is Ebenezer Scrooge!! This is the BEST version of all the Christmas Carols ever produced. I greatly enjoy the moody black and white version not the colorized one. It was a smart move to put both versions on this DVD because I know there are people who don't like black & white films (shame on them!)This is a true classic that can be watched over and over again (and not just at Christmas time either). God bless us--Everyone!\n",
      "Love this movie\n",
      "This is my favorite Christmas movie.  Alastair Sim is an excellent actor in this movie. It is such a superb and excellent movie. There is the coloured version and the black and white on the same DVD.  Beautifuly done.\n",
      "This is the best rendition ever and the black and white is the best way to view it.  Alastair Sim's best role in my opinion.\n",
      "I have always enjoyed this version of A Christmas Carol.  This blu-ray version is really outstanding.  I was amazed not only at the picture quality (scratches removed) but also the audio quality.  This is a must own on blu-ray.  The picture quality is exceptional considering the age of the original.\n",
      "It's taken me an eternity to finally get to see what's reputed as the definitive \"Christmas Carol.\"  No matter how many filmed treatments of Dickens' classic there are, it seems none begin to do justice to the images formed in one's mind by the book's grim depictions of Victorian-era England.  The first thing one realizes in this particular version is director Brian Desmond-Hurst's \"time-marches-on\" approach (not to mention his total lack of pretentiousness--a factor which has ultimately felled all other treatments); as well as the screenplay frittering away no time whatsoever in getting to Scrooge's visits with the ghosts.  The penetration into the miser's past is the focal point of the film, and Sim's performance has a through-and-through logic that makes his exuberance on Christmas morning that much more palpable.  There's a mechanical nature to the character's near-recitation of his familiar lines at the start, but his sheer vulnerability (something distinctly lacking in, say, George C. Scott's portrayal) from then onward gives it perfect sense.  Sim is every inch the visual equal to his radio-Scrooge counterpart, Basil Rathbone.Other factors contribute towards making the film the complete triumph it is: things like the visit from the ghost of Christmas Present, and the scene in the future depicting Tiny Tim's death, which for once is truly heart-wrenching.It looks like the real thing; it sounds like the real thing; Lord knows it feels like it.  It might as well BE the real thing.\n",
      "The Christmas Carol with Alastair Sims is the best movie for all Christmas time viewing.  Mr. Sims captures the character of Scrooge in the finest way.  Long before computer special effects and wizardry, Mr. Sims used  acting as his medium.\n",
      "Really enjoyed this old classic, I feel it would be good to have this as well as one of the more modern versions.  I pondered over which version of the Christmas Carol to buy as I definitely did not want a musical.  Was extremely happy to have bought this one and will play every Christmas.\n",
      "I received the DVD in a timely fashion and it was priced fairly.  It was a gift so I have not actually viewed the DVD.\n",
      "The video quality of this release is really good and the audio is much better, I really didn't remember hearing some of the background music in earlier releases.\n",
      "This version of the Christmas story is Alastair Sim's version. I remember seeing this as a child and it scared me for a few years but I couldn't help it I came back and watch it on TV each year. By the time I was a teenager I started to understand little nuances of the story. By time I was an adult I started looking at the way it was visually interesting due to Alastair's movements of his eyes and his hand gestures. I had this movie on Beta cassette; I had this movie on VHS and I had to have this movie on DVD. It is a main staple for myself and my family at Christmas time.  Enjoy!\n",
      "I always enjoyed watching this on Christmas Eve on my local PBS station growing up.  The local station where I live now doesn't have this same tradition, so its great to have the DVD.  I haven't looked at the extra material yet, but the movie itself was just as I remembered.  A few scenes weren't remastered as well as the rest of the film and I don't know if that was just a problem with the copy I received, or a problem with the film in general, but it wasn't enough of an issue for me to care.\n",
      "You cannot beat this dvd, it is the best Christmas Carol every made!!  Alaster Sims is the best Scrooge ever.  I love this dvd.\n",
      "This is my all-time favorite Christmas movie!  Alastair Sim is marvelous as Scrooge and the supporting cast is superb.  There are moments that make you cry and humorous segments that have you laughing out loud.  I realize that \"The Christmas Carol\" has been made and remade many times but I heartily recommend this rendition.\n",
      "The best \"Scrooge\" ever! This is the version I would watch all year round. The lesson in this movie shows that Christmas is just not one day but everyday. I hope this movie can teach everyone to be a blessing to someone's life whether it is helping someone out or giving kinds words to someone feeling down. We all can learn from the lessons being displayed in this movie.\n",
      "This is my husband favorite black and white version of this movie.  We would recommend this to family and friends.\n",
      "This is my favorite version of the movie.  I have all the copies of all the versions buthave loved this one since I first saw it in 1954.  It has just the right touches and he isthe perfect Scrooge.  I did have this particular movie but in VHS  so needed anothercopy - thanks for having it available.\n",
      "A Christmas Carol dvd was another gift for my husband on Christmas morning... Now he doesn't have to wait for the holidays to watch this great movie....\n",
      "I bought this DVD for my husband, he loves this version of The Christmas Carol. It arrived very quickly, and in perfect condition.\n",
      "I love this Christmas Carol out of all of them. It realy gets me into the  Chrismas Spirit.Thank you.\n",
      "This is one of the sharpest performances of a Christmas Carol you can own. The best of british actors bring the performance into England, into a Dickensian world. This, and the black and white version, give this movie an exotic flavor, a performance that is Christmas in a foreign land -- at least for this American reviewer.The package includes a colorized version, and the colorization is not bad. My kid liked the colorized version. But the black and white filmversion has more character.This is the version I grew up with. I have since seen a dozen versions, from a play at the Guthrie to Scrooged, from George C. Scott to Marlo Thomas, including the classic cartoon with Jim Backus... this performance takes the story seriously, is scary in the scary parts, and imparts a sense of joy at the conversion of Scrooge that resonates deeply, is believable, and makes me want to watch this movie again, next year, and the year after. I would put this next to A Christmas Story and It's A Wonderful Life on my shelf of Christmas films.By the way, this review also appears as an anonymous kid's review, for some reason.  That one was also written by me, a non-anonymous non-kid...\n",
      "Order was submitted, it was received very quickly there were no issues whatsoever.This is the best version of this classic and everyone should own it.\n",
      "Christmas would not be christmas without this showing of one of the best Christmas Classic around.  Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol starting Alastair Sim is probably the best version that was ever produced.  Each  scene is brought to life by the actors that portray each character.  I have  watch this movie each Christmas Eve for the last 20+ years.  Now I have my  own copy so I can watch this movie any time.  This movie is a must for each  VCR or DVD Library.  I highly recommend the purchase of this movie.\n",
      "It's delightful; it's a joy; it's a pleasure to watch, and not only at Christmas.  The DVD cover lists it as \"Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, but the film was and is titled, SCROOGE.  I bought it from Amazon in a fit of nostalgia.  I'd seen it in its original 1951 release and my memory never let go of it.  Despite the fact that the film techniques of the time were crude compared to those we so blithely expect today, the film hold its wonder.  Alastair Sim outshines all the other (and some of them big names) actors who have taken on this role.  You simply cannot take your eyes from him.  And there isn't a false note among any of the supporting cast.  I would wish that everyone would get on to Amazon now and have this in home for a family viewing feast next Christmas - or at any other time of the year for that matter.  I stop now because there's no end to the raves I could on giving this extraordinary Amazon product!P the G.\n",
      "Where do you begin with such a classic in film-making? The movie speaks for itself, but what this Ultimate Collector's Edition offers in terms of extras makes this worth every penny you spend on it, regardless of how many times you've seen the film. Rarely is a \"collector's edition\" of a film that's 50+ years old packed with this many great bonus features. The original trailers are always nice to have, and the before and after comparison of the film's restoration is truly telling. The colorized version is wonderful, and our children were delighted with it. We also get a poignant look back in time with the lives and careers of Alastair Sim, Charles Dickens, and George Minter remembered by those who worked with them and knew them well. Not to mention the audio commentary that's a perfect bonus for those who love this film. Overall, you can't go wrong with this Ultimate Collector's Edition two disc set. My only question is why aren't there more truly enlightening stories like this told these days?\n",
      "I enjoy this movies during the Christmas Holiday season. It is one of my favorites but I especially enjoy this particular version with Alastair Sim. He is awesome in this movie and so are the other actors. Great movie!\n",
      "Although this 1951 classic film takes some liberties with the Dicken's novel, it remains the film most faithful to the original story.  Some of the sets and costumes were directly inspired by the memorable illustrations in the first edition of the book.  Alastair Sim is very convincing as the miserly Scrooge who, after a terrifying night of ghostly visits,  is transformed into a man who knows how to keep Christmas in his heart.There have been many DVD editions of this holiday favorite in recent years, several of them from VCI Entertainment.  In this package, VCI has included some things featured on previous releases (commentary, Dickens biography, etc.), but the real star of this set is the beautifully restored version of the black and white film.  According to a short feature on the restoration of the film, VCI has  finally been able to obtain film elements from the original master.  Apparently they didn't have access to a complete master, so they used several of the best prints they could gather and digitally read them to determine which frames were the best available.  The rest was cleaned up by hand.  It sounds like a labor of love, and the result is visible on the screen. The restored print is available in 4x3 and 16x9 in 1:37:1 format. (According to the Amazon product description page, the aspect ratio is given as 1:87 and elsewhere as 1:33, the DVD box says 1:37.)  There are a few seconds of less than pristine audio, but overall this is a gorgeous effort.A nice touch I've never seen on a DVD before is an optional audio track for the blind, in which a narrator describes the action on the screen pausing for dialog from the actors.  A wandering commentary track with Marcus Heard and George Cole (young Scrooge) is included.  Much of the commentary is reprised in a feature interview by Heard in which Cole reminisces about Alastair Sim, \"Spirit of Christmas Past.\"  The audio is in English only.  Subtitles are in English or Spanish.The second disc offers the original 1935 Seymour Hicks' film version of the story.  A colorized version of the 1951 film is also included on Disc 2; the brief introduction by Patrick McNee (young Marley) has been seen before on previous releases of the colorized version.  There are also theatrical trailers from the UK release (\"Scrooge\") and the US release (\"A Christmas Carol\").VCI has given us a beautiful package here.  They've done a great job with the restoration of a film treasure.  Many viewers will never have seen such a good print of this holiday favorite before.  The bonus features are a nice inclusion, but the restoration is the real reason to get this edition.  Highly recommended!\n",
      "This is the DEFINITIVE version of \"A Christmas Carol\".  The acting, atmosphere, the cast, and the moral of the story are all EXCELLENT.\n",
      "This is the quintessential Christmas movie. The acting is excellent. The story is beautiful and the Blu Ray restoration is a must have for any collection.\n",
      "Alastair Sim gives without a doubt the best performance of Scrooge. Im a man who doesnt cry that often, but this movie bought a tear to my eye. If this movie dosent turn a negative reclusive person around, nothing will. It truly , for a moment lets us analize  ourselves and brings out that emotion that is sometimes forgotten around the holidays... Love. Remember, life is short..  God bless everyone\n",
      "I remember hating this movie as a kid, since my mum would play it every year.  About seven years ago, I really watched it and fell in love.  Alastair Sim is untouchable as Scrooge (although, Sir Michael Caine and Kermit the Frog manage a very close second!).  I was very excited to watch this with my family over the holidays, but no joke, my mum's bag was stolen--which contained this DVD that I bought her three years ago (she had an old VHS version that was so worn out it pretty much skipped the entire time)--and we were both devastated!!  I had to buy this again, because my mum was super upset about losing it, and I've been dying to give it to her in person!  Also, I introduced my daughter to it last year (she was barely 7 months old), and she didn't cry--so I'll take that as a sign she's going to like it! ;)\n",
      "could not find this dvd anywhere and then i thought of amazon and they had exactly what i wanted. very satisfied with product and received in perfect condition.\n",
      "I love Alistair Sim's characterization of Ebenezer Scrooge; I think he nails the multi dimensional Scrooge in a way no other actor has. But I find myself watching this version less and less every year. I think I'm a product of the computer age when special effects are more visually realistic and fascinating! Let's face it, the story 'A Christmas Carol' requires a certain amount of special effects and as much as I love the 1951 version, it's special effects with the hourglass, etc. are suboptimal (though probably amazing by 1951 standards). My ultimate version would be to take Sim as Scrooge and the characters from the 1951 version and drop them into the visually perfect Patrick Stewart movie along with assorted street sequences from the Shrewsbury location shoots from the George C. Scott version. Anyone agree with me?\n",
      "One of the all time great Christmas movies!  This is an excellent copy of one of my favorite Christmas films!\n",
      "This is the version that is the best. Even though it is in black and white. It's the best. Alastair Sim is just magnificient as Scrooge. A true adaptation of Dickens' story. It's only on once every year but it's still the best. Now even better that it's on DVD. The quality is just excellent. It never looked better!\n",
      "There some Twenty Plus A Christmas Carol and Scrooge.  First, Skip ALL that use Scrooge as a Title.  Dickens did not write Scrooge, he wrote A Christmas Carol.  Two, Skip All Past 1951.  There is NO Modern A Christmas Carol Classic.  All the Modern Ones, past 1951 are just some actor (or would be Actor) self-indulgence with extra Dull and boring.  The Cartoons are better.Alastair Sim gives a great performance and understated.  Second, I would pick, A Christmas Carol (1938).Now having said everything, that I have, The Emerald Edition by Morningstar (UPC of 063634023586).  Amazon Emerald Edition $18.99.  VCI HOME VIDEO Format: BLU-RAY/DVD COMBO Release Date: 09 Nov 2010 Amazon A Christmas Carol (Blu-ray / DVD Combo) (1951) $49.95.  After Searching around today, while writing this review.  I came upon these reviews away from amazon on Blu Ray forums.  \"I noticed in a few places what looked like ghosting or maybe an interlace issue. I thought, can't be, it's 1080P/24. My PS3 is outputting 1080P/24\", \"whatever you do, stay far, FAR away from the green covered Emerald Edition Blu-ray\", Okay, \"there is some shimmering and frame skips\".  So, I would say go with the VCI Edition.  You decide, I just bought the VCI version on Ebay for $19.95.\n",
      "An all-time classic that my husband loves to watch...over and over and over!!  Good quality tape, good clarity, a good purchase.\n",
      "A Christmas Carol is a novella by English author Charles Dickens, first published in 1843. Critical consensus deems this 1951 film version starring Alastair Sim is the very best adaptation on film.You can read the plot synopsis in any number of places on the web, so I'll spare you.I will conclude by saying that I've never liked any of the other versions I've ever seen, and this is the only version in my movie collection.\n",
      "Great to see the original in all it's black and white glory. Great rendition. DVD in great shape and quick delivery.\n",
      "Worth viewing every Christmas or anytime during the year.  Video quality was excellent.  The additional features were interesting and worth viewing.\n",
      "This is the simply the best version of Dickens' Scrooge yet made even though the more modern Production with George C. Scott should not be overlooked. Alistair Sim IS Scrooge and as for the other characters the casting was simply phenomenal. Many of those actors went on to great careers in the movies, T.V. or in plays (Michael Hordern, Patrick Macnee, Hermione Baddeley, Mervyn Johns etc.)It was pretty obvious that this entire production was a labor of love from start to finish and it did justice to Dickens in a way that not other version of Scrooge ever has.\n",
      "This is the best version of the tale and now seems to have disappeared from TV. VCR tapes are failing . It would not be Xmas w/o this. Service was fast and in good condition.\n",
      "I remember finding this exact VHS version sold by a street vendor for $3 during Christmas one year. We brought it home and it became my boyfriend's son's favorite movie. Because he was learning to read, he would ask for it by the name on the box, and he mimicked Bob Marley's ghost calling for him ... Ebeneeeezer ..... Ebenezer Scrooooogggge!!! This kid (Nicholas) would watch this movie over and over and over again. Even a little 4 year old child knew it was great. And it is. My favorite version of this movie, hands down (in addition would be the 2 cartoon versions ... Donald Duck and Mr. Magoo, which Nicholas liked, as well). But this classic in a bargain bin sold on the street ... sad ... but who knows? Maybe it made it accessible to more people that way. All I know is, I'm very glad it's finally received the praise it deserves. It is a diamond in the sand.\n",
      "The definitive version of _A Christmas Carol_  (i.e., cast, cinematography, sets, costumes, and, of course, the music!) is celebrated in this fantastic release. The print is wonderful and the bonus materials are well-worth watching:).\n",
      "This is the best version of A Christmas Carol that ever was and, in my  opinion, probably ever will be.  All others pale against this version.\n",
      "Alistair Sim's performance of Scrooge never ceases to amaze and move me. There are many great versions, but this for me completely captures the feel of Dickens.\n",

      "Ever since I saw this movie on TV when I was seven years old, it has remained my favorite film by far. I defy anyone to watch this film and not be moved to tears by it. This is one of those rare movies in which every thing and everyone is perfect. Of course, Alastair Sim is the absolute star, making Scrooge incredibly real and psychologically true. There was an earlier version out last year, but this one surpasses it, being even clearer and having all of the original soundtract intact. I can't wait to look at the bonus features, including the Hicks version from 1935, also a fine film. I hear people say that this film is too good to watch only during Christmas; I heartly second that opinion.\n",
      "Excellent movie--the classic and original.  Makes the holiday complete!!\n",
      "There can't be too many movies that have had as many or more adaptions than A Christmas Carol.  This one is my favorite.  A close 2nd. place would be the version with Reginald Owen.  A charming classic!\n",
      "After the Gosepl of Luke, the best Christmas story I've come upon is Charles Dickens's \"A Christmas Carol\".  I have to admit that I've never actually read the book but I feel as if I know it for all the movie and TV versions of it that I have seen.  By far the best one the Alastair Sim version which is titled \"A Christmas Carol\" but also shows up occassionally as \"Scrooge\" (the opening credits show \"A Christmas Carol\" and the closing credits show \"Scrooge\").I am probably a bit biased in my preference for this version because it was the first one I saw.  As a young boy, I was very much impressed by the story and especially by Alastair Sim's portrayal of Ebeneezer Scrooge.  Sim doesn't have to yell or boil over to convey the right image.  His sneering looks of disdain and rude rebuttals are enough to give you the measure of the man.  Likewise, after his visit with the three Christmas spirits, his metamorphasis as a redeemed believer is a joy to watch.  The way his joy bubbles over in his giddy behavior is most memorable.  The other actors, mostly unknown names to American movies audiences, all fit their roles very well.The special effects are about what you could expect from a 1951 English movie.  However, that is just as well because the story, not the visual effects, are what we are focussed on.  After all, the beauty of Dickens's story doesn't require any glitz.  I feel that this version does the best job of delivering story that to the audience.  If you haven't seen it before, you really need to.  Don't be put off by the black and white film, enjoy the story as it was meant to be presented.\n",
      "Video quality was fine, but the audio was not given enough attention. There were a number of \"drop-outs\" during the opening titles - probably due to deleted frames - and quite a bit of distortion during loud passages throughout the film.\n",
      "I traditionally watch this on Christmas Eve, while wrapping presents (not all Santa's helpers live at the North Pole).  I was very happy with my former DVD, but this version does not disappoint at all!  Highly recommended!\n",
      "Many versions of \"A Christmas  Carol\" depict Ebenezer Scrooge as a screaming, ranting, miserly ogre.  Throughout this version Sim manages to bring forth a much more human and sympathetic Scrooge.  From Scrooge's nervous attempts at humor while dealing with the ghost of his former partner Jacob Marley, to his uncontrollable sobbing and eventual mirth and shear joy upon his realization that he hasn't missed Christmas and still possesses the ability to make amends, Sim does a powerful job.  His intonations, gestures and facial expressions go so much deeper than simply exploding in various fits of rage.  Marley, though reprehensible, is shown as a remorseful soul, but when Scrooge just doesn't seem to grasp the message, Marley lets loose with perhaps the most haunting wail I have ever heard.  Scrooge's visit to Fred's Christmas party is also one of the most touching scenes I've ever witnessed on screen.  This version remains my favorite.  Merry Christmas, and God bless us, everyone!\n",
      "Renown Pictures LTD from England: 'SCROOGE': I've submitted a review of this film a couple years ago in which I entitled it 'The Ultimate Scrooge'. A number of reviewers found it very helpful.  This production (in England called 'Scrooge', and in the release in the USA called 'A Christmas Carol'), was produced and released in 1951. It has to be at the  top of the list of seasonal movies right up there with 'It's a Wonderful Life', 'Miracle on 34th Street', 'A Christmas Story' and other memorable movies of various genres. I won't mention the actors that were in the film  other than the lead Alistair Sim, but what I found, after browsing Wikipedia, was the history of those actors; many of them lived long lives and appeared in both  motion pictures and TV.  If you haven't seen it, either the original B&W or the 1989 colorized version, you don't know what you're missing.  Again- this film should be seasonal viewing for EVERYONE!  It is timeless, as is the message of Christmas. And I just recently received (from Amazon via my brother-in-law) the 2-volume DVD set (B&W and color) of this film.  The colorized version is very well done.  Again- this movie ought to be seen by everyone, any time- not just the Christmas Season.  As the 'Ghost of Christmas Present' says in the movie:  \"The Child born in Bethlehem does not live in the hearts of men one day a year, but all 365 days\" (or something like that).  Take it to 'heart'?\n",
      "An old favourite .Thanks for the improvements,good service,good watching.Really good value,I will be taking advantage of any future offers.\n",
      "Loved this remastered version of the movie! It's definitely clearer, and it almost seems to be in 3D. The soundtrack is much more distinct as well. This is the best of all the versions of this story, and to have it in a clearer format makes quite a difference! The interview with the young Scrooge character is interesting at points, but can be laborious...after all, the gentleman is well into his 80s and sounds tired of talking occassionally. The free version of the 1938 version is strange and nothing like any other version I've seen; it has a few moments that are pretty affecting, but on the whole, it's just weird. I think the remastered version is well worth the money! I can't watch it without crying every time--the performances are just that good.\n",
      "A Timeless and Beautiful movie,  A must have for the Christmas season!!  My favorite version of this Charles Dickens classic tale.\n",
      "this is my favorite when it comes to the movie about the Christmas Carol.  It is the best and no problems\n",
      "I read a review in which the reviewer talked about it being in B&W; versus color, and how kids don't like B&W;, etc.  How sad!  I am very glad I am old enough to not expect every movie to be in color.  To me, besides the wonderful acting and, of course, the timeless story, the  black and whiteness actually adds to the picture, to the dreariness of Scrooge's life before that fateful night.  The merry parts, yet, are no less merry for it being in B&W.;No, I have not seen every single version of \"Christmas Carol,\" nor have I wanted to.  This version is the one, to me.  The only thing better is reading the book itself.\n",
      "What can you say about this movie?Great cast, one of the best Black and Whites ever made.Great family movie,I had to have it for my collection.\n",
      "I love this version of A Christmas Carol (Scrooge).  It is my very favorite version of this classic Dickens tale.  The DVD is of excellent quality.  I was very happy to get this DVD so I could watch it at Christmas time.  It has some extra features also.\n",
      "This is my favorite version of A Christmas Carol, and the only one that I care to watch. Thank you for sending it in a timely manner and I'm the condition described.\n",
      "This is the best version of this classic Dickens tale. The acting is superb and, even though my family laughs at the overdramatization of Jacob Marley's ghost, we still love to watch this every year. Alastair Sims' performance is finely nuanced and charming.A word of warning...don't bother watching the colorized version, the original was meant to be seen in b&w.; When b&w; films were made they were directed and filmed to make the most of the shadows and light, as this one does. Colorizing this film ruins the atmosphere and makes it less intense.\n",
      "THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR MISSING!\n",
      "I grew up watching this movie, and it's a classic in MY family.  We don't watch the movie, we quote it.  No not during the movie haha but throughout the year.  Great movie all in all.  None of that silly singing throughout as some are like.  The movie is straight forward with an almost comical feel to it.  Came in record time, packaged nicely. :)  A must buy or at least must watch.\n",
      "this is the movie i remember as a child . in black and white , just wonderful. i even gave it to my son to watch because all he remembers are all the remakes. the original is the best. thankyou.\n",
      "My husband has talked about how he would watch this movie every Christmas Eve on CBS growing up. Well they no longer play it. We couldn't find this specific version in any store and it wasn't shown on TV at all during the Christmas season so we had to buy it when we found it here! Definitely helped my husband relive his childhood!\n",
      "Since I was a kid my parents have watched this movie on VHS every Christmas Eve after we were put to bed.  Saw this remastered version and knew they would love it.  The Bluray is so clear, it was like watching it for the first time.\n",
      "Because I read several negative reviews of this restoration I purchased the disc with some misgivings. I'm happy to report that my misgivings were not justified. Now, no one is harder to please than me when it comes to DVD image and sound quality. This is the best looking version of this film I've seen to date. Overall detail is vastly improved over the previous release as is contrast. I can see textures in clothing I've never seen before, as well as detail in shadows that were lacking in previous releases. The sound is 100% improved (even the Dolby Surround is effective). While there is some footage that is a bit degraded it quite minimal and accounts for only a minute or two of the entire film.Overall, a great restoration job!\n",
      "Nobody did it better than Alistair Sims.  The version is not just A classic, it is THE classic.  All you really need to know is if you haven't seen it, then see it.\n",
      "For the few remaining \"touchables\"---Sim's acting is riveting-- Not a performance -- a life-time achievement.\n",
      "Alastair Sim's version of a Christmas Carol has always been my favorite, even though I wasn't born until 10+ years after he made this movie.  I am happy with the quality received.  There were 2 brief skips in dialogue(0.5 seconds), but I believe that these were faults in the original masters.  The rest of the movie was flawless.\n",
      "This in my opinion is the best adaptation of this story out there. If you were going to watch a Christmas Carol this is the one to watch.\n",
      "excellent!! very quick delivery and in perfect condition! Of all the versions of this movie over the years, this was the one my Mom likes best and she had a hard time finding it...but 2 Amazon clicks and there it was!  She was very happy to get it!\n",
      "Great movie, but I didn't notice much improvement in picture or sound over the DVD version I bought a few years ago, but then again considering the film's age, I wasn't expecting to be blown away.\n",
      "This is it!  There are myriad versions and adaptations of this wonderful tale but this is the one.  Black & White and even a little Spooky!  The George C. Scott version I must admit is well done but none can hold a  Christmas Candle next to this one!\n",
      "BY far the best film version ever made of this classic. A must own DVD if ever there was one. The music alone is worth it....\n",
      "This is the Christmas Carol that all the others are measured by even the ones the precede it . The only other the even come close are Albert Finey's Scrooge (The Muscial) and George C Scott's version  both I also highly recomend\n",
      "This is a wonderful production of A Christmas Carol.  Sim portrays Scrooge perfectly and he is the barometer in which all future Scrooge's will be judged.  He genuinely displays fear when the first two spirits appear but appears to be resigned to the fact that the Ghost of Christmas Present and the Ghost of Christmas Future reveals themselves.  This is an astonishing performance.\n",
      "we really love this.it is are favorite version. got tired of looking for it every year so now we can enjoy it at our leisure.\n",
      "This story has been done over and over, ad nauseum.  THIS version is the ONLY one I'll watch.  Alistair Sim was THE Scrooge and even though this film is older than I am , it resonates with me.  I've never seen the colorized version, the B&W is too good and it would feel \"wrong\" for it to be in color!  Enjoy this, it will be a Christmas tradition for you every year.\n",
      "i remember watching this movie on tv every holiday season as a kid.the movie disappeared from the airwaves and i didn't see it for a long times. its been remade a few times since then but never measures up.now i have my own copy and i never enter the holiday season without watching it.amid the great performances there is a powerfull message for everyone.\n",
      "Absolutely tops!  No man like Alastair Sims to do the transformation from evil to good in the Christmas season in an hour of movie time.\n",
      "Seen all the rest.  Most stink like dead fish.Alastair Sim really play Scrouge the best.For Christmas I got the silent movie and I got a good laughwhen I open the gift.  I'm always saying Baw Hum Bug at Christmas time.So they got me.  With this movie.  Silent because I go to silent moviesand leason to the Might Wurlitzer being played along with the movie.\n",
      "This classic film has been given an amazing restoration.  Not only have they cleaned up the dirt and scratches, but the audio is now much clearer and noise free.  The Blu-Ray disc is also incredibly sharp.  It's just amazing.\n",
      "I have loved this movie since I saw it many years ago and have been waiting for it to come out on DVD.  Now that it is out and especially since they have done a \"cleaned up\" version, it is even better than I remembered.  You can't go wrong with having a copy of this movie in your library.\n",
      "I own the VHS version I purchased at Blockbuster over 10 years ago.This is a classic and to readily enjoyed by the young and old.  As others have noted, I used to scour the TV guide every week from Thanksgiving on to find a time to enjoy this film.The best element of this film, which is shared by the Teledrama with George C Scott is the serious nature of the pre repentant Scrooge.The Muscial Scrooge with Albert Finney makes him a comic character. This is shared by a great version with George Bacchus as the voice in Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol.In this sense, I prefer the George C Scott version, filmed during the Wall Street era of the 80's, where Scrooge is well groomed, intelligent, and flawed. He is the consumate conservative businessman of both Dickens time, and our own.I enjoy and own both versions.\n",
      "This is without a doubt the best version of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol to date. The acting is excellent. The DVD version is good too, because you have the full original black and white version, and you can  also view various scenes in colour. Just one question though, why is this  film called A Christmas Carol in America, when here in the UK it is called  Scrooge?\n",
      "This is just what I expected. I really enjoy watching this movie at this time of year. It is a true classic.\n",
      "This has always been my favorite version of this classic story, with apologies to George C. Scott, Jim Carey, Patrick Stewart, and even Scrooge McDuck. All the other versions are fine pieces of work as well (I enjoy all of them) but somehow this version always seemed the best to me - in large part due to it being in black and white and the very stark, cold look the director imbued the film with. Alastair Sim does an absolutely terrific job in bringing the viewer into his character; he plays the role in such a way that even in the very early scenes he elicits just a trace of sympathy (perhaps pity?) from the audience which allows one to immerse oneself in his adventure to a great extent. Now this classic comes to Blu-Ray.The quality of the Blu-Ray is certainly not what some who have reviewed it were expecting and though I respect those opinions I suspect this is more a matter of source material rather than a poorly implemented transfer. This movie was shot in a very dark, high-contrast way which I am certain was intentional and is quite appropriate as this adds to the foreboding mood. The dark sets clearly required the director to \"push\" film technology to the limit which resulted in much more film grain than is seen in most features. This film grain is clearly visible on this Blu-Ray and this is not a look familiar in other discs. The lack of perfect definition does not seem to be an artifact of a poor transfer but a limitation in the 35 mm negative which was reportedly used to produce this disc. The only alternative is to digitally remove the film grain with DNR (digital noise reduction), and I am VERY happy they did not do that!I do not have a DVD version with which to compare but there are several scenes which looked totally different from what I have seen in the past on television. The best example was the scene when Scrooge has arrived home and is locking his doors (he double or triple locks both his front door and his bedroom door!) - during this fairly extensive scene I vividly recall wondering what was going on in the past since in versions shown on TV there is sometimes almost nothing visible except for Scrooge's almost ghostly face along with the candle he is carrying. In the Blu-Ray, by contrast (pun intended), the scene is full of interest with the bannister and stairs and shadows from windows in a fan-shaped pattern on the floor. Much later, after Scrooge's \"awakening\" (literally and figuratively), the snow-filled scenes on Christmas morning also look better than ever with a vibrancy which I have not seen on past views. I got the feeling watching this disc that this level of definition has not been seen since this was in the theaters in 1951.I have read a couple criticisms of this disc including an automatically-running advertisement for other releases by the same company which follows the words \"Don't touch the remote\" or some such as soon as the disc is inserted. Some noted that they were forced to watch this presentation as their remotes would not forward past it. I found that at least on my Sony Blu-Ray player I could simply select menu and was able to immediately play the feature. I also read about some subtle video anomalies at certain points in the film on the informational site blu-ray.com (this is not a sales site). I actually checked out the spots they referred to and to say the least the anomalies are very subtle, I would never have noticed them without the heads-up. They may be more visible on a PS3 (as the author of that review noted).In summary, I am very pleased with this purchase and recommend this film without reservation.\n",
      "Alastair Sim is without a doubt, the one and only Scrooge, although Albert Finney plays a close second in his musical.\n",
      "I was pleasantly surprised by the overall quality of this DVD version of \"A Christmas Carol\".  I really like the colorized version (it is well done), but I am glad the original B&W; version is included as well.Alastair Sim is magnificent in the role of Scrooge.  This version has the most complete story of how Scrooge came to become a mean old miser.  There is plenty of detail in his journey back in time with the Ghost of Christmas Past.  I think the most enjoyable part of the movie is Scrooge's behavior on Christmas morning.  It is a brilliant piece of acting.  I have only seen this movie on TV (never on the big screen), and the DVD version is much crisper and cleaner than the broadcast versions.\n",
      "This is the best version of \"A Christmas Carol\"! I grew up with this version and now it's impossible to find on cable. THANK YOU!!!\n",
      "This remake is an excellent and inspiring dvd.  while shared with the whole family, it didn't seem to quite capture the attention of our children like it captivated me.  BW and Color option was nice.  I watched color before Christmas and then B&W on Christmas eve and will probably do so again next year.  Outstanding product!!!\n",
      "I remember it well, 50 years or longer, it was one of holiday's favorite treats, It saddened & uplifted spirit then & now. Keep the film available for suture generations. Hope some philanthropic entity will make effort to preserve it.\n",
      "The classic Dickens tale has been portrayed and interpreted many times by many actors.  From George C. Scott, and Albert Finney to Henry Winkler and even good ol' Bill Murray, to name just a few.  But while so many variations of A Christmas Carol has been seen, only one can truly be experienced, and that is this version starring Alastair Sim.  Alastair portrays Scrooge like no other as, or perhaps ever will.  Christmas cannot be complete without this classic.  Even those who are not fans of Dickens or this timeless story, you will surely be inspired and pleased with this superb rendition.\n",
      "Alistair Sim's Scrooge has no peer.  He's simply the best -- by turns snide, threatening, terrified, manic and awkwardly loving, he makes this hackneyed character fully human.  And I'm no purist -- I love the garish colorized version (classic B&W included, too).\n",
      "Simply the definitive version of Charles Dickens' beloved classic \"A Christmas Carol\".  Alastair Sim delivers a delicious, flawless, once in lifetime performance as that pitiful old piker, Ebenezer Scrooge, injecting the vital element of dimensionality into the character, an element scarcely seen in other versions.  The primary motivation for Scrooge's unsavory demeanor is not something as superficial as the thirst for wealth.  No, Scrooge's hatred is the result of something deeper, more intrinsic, more human.  Sim masterfully establishes this fact with acute understanding of the character.  Everything from the manner in which he walks to the way he forms his words is given the proper nuance, yielding an entirely convincing and empathic performance.  I have often thought Alastair must have been temporarily possessed by Dickens' mind to have pulled it off!If Alastair's performance were all there was to offer, it would be enough to make this an instant classic.  But this version of \"A Christmas Carol\" is blessed with superb performances from the entire cast.  Everyone from the Ghost of Jacob Marley to Tiny Tim seem to have been personally handpicked by Dickens' himself!  The period detail is flavorful, the score fitting.  With all due respect to Charles, even the liberties taken with the story are an improvement on the book!  Charles Dickens would be proud!\"A Christmas Carol\" and its message are something we all can believe in and enjoy, regardless of religion. It is truly a tale that should not be enjoyed one day of the year, but all 365!Oh...  I almost forgot!  \"Bah, humbug!\"... \"God bless us, everyone.\"  Couldn't resist!\n",
      "This version of the classic story by Dickens is my favorite. Alastair Sim brought more life, for me, to the character of Scrooge than any other actor that has played the role.  The reunion between him and his nephew on Christmas Day causes a welling in my throat, and tears to my eyes simply by thinking about it, where this actor's portrayal touched more closely to my soul.\n",
      "I have seen the various versions over the years.  For the last 50 years I have watched the Alistair Sim version.  It has become a Christmas tradition with my family (now to the third generation).  We watch it each Christmas Eve.  For us it is as important as our tree.  And we say \"God bless us everyone.\"\n",
      "The giddy dance Sim does as Ebenezer at the end of the movie is too awesome to miss. What a wonderful testimony to these many actors like Sim many of whom are now gone.\n",
      "This is the version I grew up watching, and to me it is still the best. No one else even comes close to Alastair Sim as Scrooge. He will always BE Scrooge for me!  I make it a point to watch this version every year -- Christmas just wouldn't be complete without it -- and I'm going to order this DVD for Christmas 2006.No matter how many times I've seen this movie (and it's a lot of times, b/c this movie and I were born in the same year!), I always get teary-eyed at the end when Tiny Tim runs up to Scrooge and you hear the narrator speak the closing lines.  It may be terribly sentimental of me, but I really have a soft spot for this movie.I agree with some of the other reviewers who said \"A Christmas Carol\" is one of the greatest and most important stories ever written. It has probably been remade more than any other fictional story. I doubt that Charles Dickens ever would have believed that this little book would become such an important fixture of the Christmas season!  Even if this had been the only book he had ever written, he could be proud of the legacy he has left to the world.If there is possibly anyone out there who has never seen Alastair Sim's Scrooge, you have GOT to see this movie! No one else's Scrooge will ever satisfy you after that.\n",
      "Allistair Sim IS Ebenezer Scrooge!!! This version is excellent!!  Beats out all the rest!!! A must have for your collection!!\n",
      "this movies from 1951 was a all time favorite. they do not show it on tv very often.  now I can see it any time I want.  it came bland new. fast. will watch it every year from now on. thank you.\n",
      "This is without question the best version of a Christmas carol ever made. If you haven't seem this one you are truly missing something. A must see for anyone who considers themselves a movie lover.\n",
      "Always looked for this each Christmas on TV, now I can view it anytime I like.  Reminds me of childhood and the traditions set forth.\n",
      "This version of A Christimas Carol is one of my all-time favorite movies.  I was so pleased when the dvd arrived when promised, and its with the quality.  Thank you, Amazon!\n",
      "I have always loved the movie about scrooge even though its been done so many times in so many ways. This is the original but it's still very good and the moral is very strong.\n",
      "My favorote Christmas movie. I like to watch this one in the wee hours of Christmas morning.\n",
      "Absolutely the finest \"Christmas Carol\" version, it is not even a close contest..Alastair Sim is masterful.  I recommend that everyone grab the original B&W version and watch it with the entire family, the last thing you do Christmas Eve...you will not be disappointed..\n",
      "If you like Scrooge movies this is the best. Alastair Sims really brings to life the old tight wad. I watch this one over and over. Even in the summer\n",
      "The DVD was everything we had hoped for..actually two DVDs one in color and one black and white...great buy...\n",
      "The best Christmas Carol movie out there. Nothing like sticking with the old, when Hollywood knew how to make good movies using actors that could really act!\n",
      "I love this movie and this remastered copy is great.  My only was problem I didn't realize that it is colorized.  Not a big fan of that.  Othewise, I'm very pleased with the purchase.\n",
      "I have seen most versions of the Christmas Carol and by far Alastair Sim gives the best performance.  Mr. Sim is sincere in both aspects of Scrooge - that being the worst and the \"changed for the better\".\n",
      "THIS IS THE ORIGINAL CLASSIC CHRISTMAS CAROL. MY FIANCE WATCHED AT LEAST TEN TIMES OVER AND OVER. EXCELLENT FIVE STAR MOVIE.\n",
      "Over the years there have been sooooo many versions of this wonderful Dickens story.  From all the version I have seen this really is the most accurate to the best telling of it which of course is by Charles Dickens himself!  If you are looking for a movie version of A Christmas Carol this is the one I would suggest.I don't own this exact DVD with the black and white and color version; I have the black and white only.\n",
      "I brought this 2 DVD story because I know the one with Alister Simm is the best version. This came with color and black and white, both revised and in great shape. Truly a great Christmas present idea, and to have to watch every year!\n",
      "There are so many different versions out there and my personal favorite is this one. The more modern George C. Scott version is my second favorite. The musical versions out there just don't cut it and trying to watch the Grinch, The Mask, or Captain Picard playing Scrooge just does not make the cut. Not too keen on the animated versions also. Sometimes its best not to mess with the Classics.\n",
      "I cannot say enough good about Alastair Sim. This is a must have. I HIghly recommend it. It is a tradition for me and my family to watch this beginning around Thanksgiving. It is heart warming. I had it on VHS and upgraded to this blue ray and even another for my son. This is true great acting. If I could only wish you would watch one movie at the Holidays, I would HIGHLY Recommend you watch this one. Remember what Christmas is really about. Giving. Sharing. Loving. Helping. GOD Bless us,  Everyone!\n",
      "They never show this version on tv anymore, and it's by far the best adaption of \"A Christmas Carol\"! Good quality and it was delivered within the specified time, at a low price.\n",
      "Reasonable Price, delivered as promised.  This is the only Christmas Carol I will watch.  This is the first Christmas Carol that was aired on television.  All the other Christmas Carols are not as good as this one.\n",
      "my mum asked if i could get this movie for  her. i watch it  and it was fantastic  to get both colour and black and white version was great...\n",
      "I have always favored this particular version of A Christmas Carol.....the Brits do this movie better than anyone. The characters are vivid and seem to match what I used  to see in the book. Alastair Sim's is a most wonderful Scrooge.....very grouchy and mean. Buy this version..you will be completely delighted with it.\n",
      "An old \"classic\" I've been watching every year on t.v. for years!  This is my favorite ...the one with Alistair Sim playing the role of Scrooge.  No one does it better.  This year I decided I should just BUY a copy so I could watch this great movie when I wanted to, instead of waiting for it to come on t.v.\n",
      "This is one of the greatest movies of the Christmas carol ever made. My copy was borrowed and never returned. Thank you for having it still.\n",
      "I love \"A Christmas Carroll\" and have seen it many times but when I saw this one in color it was such a treat!It made the viewing experience 10x better. In color, it seems as if you can all of a sudden notice things in thefilm that were not noticed in black and white.  It is truly a work of art.  Very highly recommend this. You will treasure itand want to watch it every Christmas!\n",
      "I found this movie of A Christmas Carol to be enchanting,the old classic of Scrooge is the best! Highly recommend as a Family movie!\n",
      "Certainly we have all seen A Christmas Carol before is some form or another, whether it be a faithful version of the Charles Dickens classic or a more modern telling of the story by the Muppets or like Bill Murray in Scrooged.  So reviewing the film is kind of silly, you know what you are getting in that respect.  What is important to know about this DVD set is what you will be getting with the greatest Christmas fable and how you are getting it.In this 1951 Alastair Sim version, you get three different versions of the film on the two disk Ultimate Collector's Edition; there is the remastered black and white version (which has an accompanying audio commentary by Marcus Hearn and George Cole) in both full screen and widescreen as well as the colorized version in the widescreen format.  It is wise to stick with the black and white (which is digitally restored as seen in a special feature) because the color looks like your basic looks like they painted each frame type of colorized version of the film.  Then as an added bonus, they also threw in the 1935 version of Scrooge.Also included on the DVD's are interviews with George Cole about Alastair Sim as well as one with Richard Gordon about George Minter and Renown Pictures, both lasting over ten minutes.  There is also a short on Charles Dickens himself as well as Cast Bios, Photo and Press Book Gallery as well as trailers for both the 1935 film and the 1951 version.  In the end, the film is a timeless classic that any family can watch together during the holiday season.\n",
      "I'm a big fan of 'A Christmas Carol', and I've seen most of the film versions many times.  I like George C. Scott's portrayal of Scrooge a lot.  That 1998 production has a much better look than the 1951 Alistair Sim's version.  The colors are rich and vibrant, the special effects superior, and the secondary characters are well acted.  Patrick Stewart's is also a good film.Then why do I prefer this version better?  Somehow, it seems truer to the time when Dickens wrote the story.  It was filmed in a post-war Britian that was still very much recovering from the tremendous economic dislocations that World War II brought.  The actors seemed more in tune somehow with the bleak late 19th century that was Dicken's time.  In the Scott version, everyone looked, well, too well-fed. And too warm.  Seriously.You can feel the chill of Scrooge's bed chambers when Alistair Sim plays the tightwad.  You identify with Scrooge saving his coal, and tightening his collar. You can understand the real thrill that would accompany the dividing up of his few goods after Scrooge died.  The cemetary that the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come takes Scrooge to seems more cold, dark, and lonely.And Sims inhabits the role better than Scott.  Hard to say that, since Scott was one of the finest actors in the twentieth century, but Scott just doesn't have the absolute glee that Sims has when he discovers he has survived to see another Christmas Day.  Sim literally dances with joy!  The transformation is convincing, and the range Sim shows it superb.  The contrition Sims shows when confronted with his life seems genuine. And I liked the nephew and his family a lot better in the Sims version.  They seemed more authentic and truer to Victorian England.Please, please, please stay away from the colorized version.  It's OK, but the film was made in B&W; and it should be seen as filmed.  BTW, this film is actually titled 'Scrooge'.Very highly recommended. A must-see at Christmas.\n",
      "I just received this DVD and am impressed with the quality of this version. The source is from the original British print (\"Scrooge\") and for a film 50+ yrs. old is in very nice shape. There are a few speckles and a scratch or two on the original source film, but I am very pleased overall. The opening and closing by Patrick Macnee is nice but dated, he states that this 1951 movie is only 38 yrs old. My biggest complaint is that the DVD option screens are difficult to read as the green lettering is hard to read on the backgrounds. Also the white type used in the CAST/ PRODUCTION NOTES section is tiny and hard to read as well. The Max Fleischer cartoon is OK, but not great- scratches, sound dropoffs. Max Fleischer's Superman cartoons are much better. Overall, I'm very happy with this DVD. It's great to have the option of colorized or B+W with a beautiful copy of this holiday classic.\n",
      "I think this is the one of the best versions of \"A Christmas Carol\" ever made.  Alastair Sim is brilliant as Scrooge and it is a must watch during the Christmas holiday season.  It really helps get you in to the Christmas spirit.\n",
      "If one movie captures the meaning of christmas its this film. The morals taught are timeless. Allistair Sim is the best Scrooge ever. His portrayal is the standard to which all that follow try to match up too and often fall short. The black and white version is the best. It gives it a feel of a ghost story. This is a timeless classic for the whole family to see. It just wouldnt be christmas with out it.\n",
      "I always loved this story and this '51 version is definitely the best. And this latest edition is the best presention of that version. The restoration is excellent. There are three versions. Two with different diffentions. It is like I was watching it for the first time. The third one is in color. I like the b/w versions better but still interesting to see it in color again. Again with the new restoration like seeing it for the first time. The fourth and last version is the '35 version. Not even a comparision to the '51 version but interesting to watch as well, just around one hour in length. It has not aged well but still worth at least one viewing. I watched all four versions the first weekend I received it from Amazon. A lot of extras; all interesting. You have to see one of the '51 versions with George Cole commentary. He plays the young Scoorge and was close to  Alastair Sims in real life, very interesting. This and the Wizard of OZ I never get tired of viewing. A must have to your video collection.\n",
      "This is the best by far of all versions of this movie.  This includes the previous, as well as all later productions.\n",
      "Of all the video versions of  \"A Christmas Carol\" out there this one is my favorite (followed by A Muppet Christmas Carol). As with other old movies I have on VHS, the DVD version has a much clearer image and sound. I never get tired of watching this version of this movie. I may change my mind if I ever get a TV that is HD but until then I'm happy to have found it on DVD and rescuing another old movie from disappearing. Hope to continue enjoying it for years to come.\n",
      "Absolutely the BEST version ever! Alastair Sim IS the best Scrooge ever!Christmas Eve is not the same without this movie playing at least once in the family room. We have watched this since I was a child and hoped to for many more years to come.\n",
      "We have watched this movie on TV for years and I finally decided it was time to buy.  Of all the other versions out there, many very good, we still find this one the best!  We also prefer the B&W version versus the colorized.\n",
      "I've seen several versions of this classic Dickens story.  For my family and me this is the quintessential Christmas Carol.  Sim delivers a moving portrait of Scrooge, his laughter becomes contagious, his despotism convincing.  For me, there is no other version that will match this.  All of the characters from Bob and Mrs. Cratchet, \"and all the assorted little Cratchets\" deliver a convincing and moving performance.One thing to remember is that all the accents in this film are British.  Isn't that the way it should be?  Many remakes simply don't have the authenticity.  This is a family keepsake.\n",
      "I saw this movie a long time ago on television and had been looking for it in stores with no success.  I love it and am glad it is on DVD.  I like the fact that there is both a black & white version and a colorized version included in the package.  There is also an older \"A Christmas Carol\" included as well.I received this DVD in a timely manner and it was well packaged.  Overall, I was VERY pleased with my purchase.\n",
      "Great.. Sets the tone for the holidays..Watch it over and over !!! Have watched this for years, wore out my first one..\n",
      "This is the original Christmas Carol which has been re-made over and over and over again through out the years. But it still is the best after all these years. My dad and I used to wait every year for the Christmas Carol to come on TV, now this year I finally bought it on DVD and we can watch it when ever we want.It comes with two disks. One disk is the original black and white version in full & wide-screen formats. And the second disk is the colorized version of the same movie both in full & wide screen formats.Like I said, this is the original, and its the best, the only other version of the story I like is the on Patrick Stewart (from Star Trek & X-Men) played in. This should defantly be a Christmas must have for your family.\n",
      "Many adaptations of Dickens' Christmas book have been and gone, but this is generally thought to be one of the definitive films of the story. The classic 1951 version with Alistar Sim as Ebenezer Scrooge, and the fine Mervyn Johns and Hermoine Baddeley as the Cratchits. The introduction is given by Patrick Macnee(\"The Avengers\")who had a small role in the film as young Jacob Marley!) Both color and black  and white versions were on the DVD (of course, the original is still the best)plus a vintage Rudolf cartoon!  This timeless classic is a must for your holiday DVD library.\n",
      "my husband and i watch this version every christimas with our children.it is in our opinion the all greatest version.\n",
      "Another of my favorite versions, great to have playing in the background while people are visiting during the holidays.  It needs to be in every Christmas collection.\n",
      "This movie is a classic and Alistar Sims, who played Scrooge made it especially a good quality movie.  There were other good actors too.  It brought out the true meaning of Christmas, the spirit of giving and love and how one man's life inspired and impacted the lifes of others and he found that true meaning and a lifetime change in himself.  The movie was worth watching and I highly reccommend it. Thank you.  Sheila Miesfeld\n",
      "A Christmas Carol (Ultimate Collector's Edition) with Alastair SimsThis is our FAVORITE version of A Christmas Carol and we watch it every single year now!\n",
      "This version of Dickens' timeless story best reflects the Christian perspective of the book.  When the Ghost of Jacob Marley shows sinners in torment outside of Scrooge's window, the main point is made crystal clear--the salvation of the old miser's soul.  Try to avoid any of the colorized productions of this grand old British film.  Perfect family viewing.\n",
      "My Favorite Christmas Carol Movie...This Edition is Great ...I love the different versions available on this disk...I will recommend to everyone.\n",
      "I ordered this for the DVD, I don't have a blu-ray player.  Both formats are included in this package.  I have loved the movie for decades, so no problem there.  I had been under the impression, based on other reviews, that this package might contain a colorized version, which, as it turned out, it does NOT.  I wanted the color version, which I had seen on TV in the past, so this package did disappoint me.  I think that sometimes the reviews are confusing because they don't always match the product since products may be packaged differently from time to time. ?  It seemed like this package was priced at the best price I would be able to find, and I did want the movie even if it wasn't in color, so I took a chance.\n",
      "Have been looking for this movie for some time. Try to find it on TV every Christmas season and itreally is hard to find this version. This is the best one.\n",
      "Was very disappointed that older versions of A Christmas Carol were not shown on TV during Christmas season.  Order this as a post Christmas gift for my family since we love the older versions of this movie.\n",
      "Timeless Christmas tale that can be watched time and time again. My personal childhood favorite movie that matches to the Dickens' novel.\n",
      "This superb movie is a Christmas Eve tradition in my home. It is the definitive Christmas movie guaranteed to warm your heart and restore all the wonderful Christmas feeling in you.Alistair Sim is of course superb as Scrooge, the famous old miser created by Charles Dickens, who has his faith in people and life in general restored one Christmas Eve when he is visited by three spirits. What is so wonderful about this story, and indeed also as a result of Sim's superb performance, is that Scrooge ultimately comes across as a tragic figure who you can't help feeling for totally by movie end. The scenes from his past are in particular very moving and indeed tragic and go a long way to explaining why Scrooge has ended up bitter with the world in generalAll the performances are top rate and the production itself is lavish and very authentic bringing alive a Victorian Christmas in London complete with snow, children singing carols, gas lamps etc all those things you see on traditional Christmas Cards nowadays.While there have been many other superb versions of this great story, this version is by far and away the best of the lot. If you buy one film for your collection this year make sure it is the Alistair Sim version of \"A Christmas Carol\" you will never regret purchasing it and year after year it will fill you and your home with Christmas spirit and good cheer\n",
      "This was a great restoration job.  Not only was the color version very well done, but the black and white was crisp and clear.\n",
      "I've loved the story \"A Christmas Story\" since I was a kid.  I believe that this dvd version is the best for its interpretation of Scrooge's encounter with the Ghost of Jacob Marley. To quote the book: \"There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate.\"  All the other versions try to ease the impact on the audience of Jacob Marley's horrible life after death. In so doing cause the audience to miss a important part of the story.  This rendering enables a better understanding Jacob Marley's death and suffering in a such way that the audience comes away with a much better impression of the good that occurs to Scrooge.\n",
      "I love all things related to the Christmas Carol story.  Just want to add this version to all of the versions that I already have.\n",
      "A Holiday must for all. Alastair Sim is (in my humble opinion only) the one and only Scrooge...I love this black & white flick...Happy Holidays,Smacka\n",
      "Several renditions of A Christmas Carol have been released since this 1951 film  but no other performance can equal Alistair Sim's portrayal of Scrooge! This black and white film still beats all the others. This is a truly perfect film because each actor is suited perfectly to the character they portray along with a fantastic film score.  This is a must have DVD for any Scrooge fan!\n",
      "this version is my favorite. I have a collection of \"Christmas Carol\" movies and watch them every year as part of the holiday. Having both color and black and white is nice, but I still favor the old black and white the best! I never get tired of it!\n",
      "This is such a classic, why wouldn't you want to have this special collector's edition. This has the film in it's original black & white print, well restored and preserved thank god! As well as the film colourised, which i think in this instance is done well.The DVD extras here are very good. The interview with actor George Cole is good to hear as he reminisces about working with Alistair Sim, and the film's director Brian Hurst.I believe that Alistair Sim's Scrooge is the best characterization of Scrooge ever put on film. I feel the same way about the whole film in fact.Some of Alistair's best scenes are at the end of the film, when he is ecstatically happy.George Cole here plays Ebenezer Scrooge as a younger man, and he really is just a faint glimmer - if that, of his famous television character in later years of Arthur Daley in 'Minder'.The 2nd disc has the much earlier 1935 Seymour Hicks version of Scrooge, which I must admit I haven't watched yet due to being very busy - but i look forward to it.The feature commentary with Marcus Hearn and George Cole is very informative and interesting as well.\n",
      "I have watched many film adaptations of Charles Dickens classic story 'A Christmas Carol', but this is the one I think of when I think of Scrooge.  Yes Alastair Sim plays his role superbly.  He is wicked when necessary and hilariously jovial when the character turns good.This DVD is great because it allows people to watch both a colorized version and an original black and white edition.  I prefer black and white because I think of this movie as a mild horror film, but I watch the color version occasionally too.  Both versions are great.\n",
      "Great DVD.  You can watch in Black and White or the colorized version.  Great holiday classic to have in your library.\n",
      "I won't have to try to catch this version of Scrooge, when it is showing on Cable.  They seldon show this version. I tend to like the colorized, even if it is not tradional to some folks.....  Been happy with them both.\n",
      "This is the classic version of A Christmas Carol.  An annual favoriate in my house each year.  I love this movie.\n",
      "A dvd version of \"Scrooge\" starring Alistair Sim in the title role.My favorite vesrion and one that I had seen every Christmas since 1958 through 2007.  It was not shown on my cable tv this past year and I swore I would not miss it again.And now I won't !!\n",
      "This is it, all the christmasy feel you need in one movie!  The acting is great, the scenery fantastic and the black and white keeps the feel of the Dickens story. It comes in the colorized version but that is for gits!HOHOHO\n",
      "I am glad this is on dvd my vhs tape was wearing out.\n",
      "Everyone will love this classic family friendly movie.  Great values and great faith.\n",
      "No question, this is the quintessential Christmas Carol!  The copy of the film is very good, but not Criterion level.  Another reviewer discusses an intro, cartoon, and colorized version.  None of these were included on the DVD I received, but they were not missed.  There is a written bio on Sim that mentions he has a teenage daughter and enjoys tennis.  Perhaps Jacob Marley is his doubles parter?\n",
      "Dickens, particularly because of \"A Christmas Carol,\" has sometimes been categorized as an unbearably sentimental religious radical. What is remarkable about this superb British film is its skillful avoidance of any easy sentimentality. Happily then, in this hard-headed version, we don't see, for instance, what sometimes happens in other, treacly adaptations, the enlightened Scrooge himself late in the film bringing a turkey or goose to Tiny Tim's Christmas dinner. It's sufficient that Scrooge orders its delivery from a street urchin for a price. Further, we are shown in depth the psychological background which helped create Ebenezer Scrooge, a dreadfully narrow man of business who could be considered, perhaps, the original MBA, or Gordon Gekko of his era.The DVD Collectors' Edition has been justly praised for including 4 versions of the film, 2 in noble black and white, and the other 2 in meretricious color. Thus, there's something here for everyone's taste, no matter how fine or misguided. The edition also features a winning interview with the excellent comic actor George Cole, who discusses his work with Alastair Sim, the marvelous Scrooge, and makes one hunger for remastered versions of the St. Trinians films as well as the oddly neglected, riotously funny, \"Green Man.\"And now to Sim, the principal delight of this version. With his bulging eyes, toothy grimaces of fright, and plummy voice, he surpasses all other screen portrayers so far of this initially nasty convert. I suspect if Dickens had been lucky enough to see Sim's performance, he would have raved along with the rest of us.\n",
      "There are many versions of The Christmas Carol but this version is the one all strive to be like.  Alister Sims by far shows the transformation of Scrooge.  I highly recommend this movie if you want to get the essence of the book.\n",
      "My father has always loved the old scratchy 35 version and I've always like the Alastair Sim version so this worked out great.  I used to worry about when they were showing either of these versions since it seems like they are now only plugging the newer versions.  Now that I have this dvd I no longer have to worry.  This is a great dvd with great versions of the story.  I'd highly recommend getting this.  They just can't seem to convey the story any better than these.\n",
      "Whether you prefer the colorized or the original black & white, there is only one true Scrooge -- Alastair Sim.  This is a true classic and is well worth owning.As to the actual dvd, I've only watched the colorized myself, but have seen no issues with the picture displayed.\n",
      "Clearly the best version of this story.  And I still enjoy watching it in its original black and white.  Recommend it.\n",
      "This is the best movie of all the Christmas Carol versions with Alastair Sim as Scrooge.  I also watched another version on the CD that I had never seen before.  Nice CD to own.\n",
      "Perfect.A double DVD with all versions of the movie, including the original and restored / colorized one.Many extras and information included.Well worth the price, a VERY good buy!\n",
      "+++++Many people know this story written in 1843 by Charles Dickens (1812-1870).  Old Ebenezer Scrooge, the meanest miser in London, overworks and underpays his clerk, Bob Cratchit, whose small son, Tiny Tim, is crippled and may soon die.  On Christmas Eve, Scrooge has a vivid nightmare.  He is visited by three ghosts who change his life forever.This 1951 movie (originally filmed in black and white) that's about 88 minutes long is entitled (as the movie's opening credits indicate and despite what the DVD package states) \"Scrooge in Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol.\"Of all similar movies made, this one stays closest to Dickens' original story.  You can see this right at the beginning of the movie where we are shown a cover page from a manuscript that's written in Old English font.  On this page it says: \"Stave I: Marley's Ghost.\"  Dickens divided his \"Carol\" into musical staves rather than chapters.  Then the narrator utters one of the most famous sentences in English literature: \"Old Marley was as dead as a doornail.\"  The story then unfolds from this point on.What really makes this story come alive (and makes the movie a classic) is Alastair Sim's performance as Scrooge (not to mention the fine supporting performances).  It seems that Sim's Scrooge is not so much haunted by actual ghosts as tormented by inner demons; the ghosts are \"analysts\" who force him to confront his traumatic self.  Once this confrontation is complete, we see Scrooge's monumental transformation into joy.  (It's this transformation that Sim the actor does so well.)  The emotional impact of his delirium of joy is actually cathartic for the movie viewer as well, filling the viewer with good feelings.It should be mentioned that it's important to view this movie in black and white because this seems to aid the powerful emotional impact of Scrooge's (as played by Sim) transformation into joy.  For some reason, this impact is lost when the movie is in color.The strong background music for this movie seems to add to each scene.  As well, the sets are visually stunning.  They spread before us a vivid picture of nineteenth century London.One of my favorite scenes in the movie occurs after Scrooge's transformation.  He visits his nephew Fred's home where a party is underway.  This scene also has great emotional impact on the movie viewer.  We also get to see Scrooge's (as well as Sim's) polka dancing talent.In conclusion, be sure to see this magical movie.  By doing so, the ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present, and Christmas Yet To Come will cast their powerful spell on you also!!+++++\n",
      "This is just a good movie in my opinion.  This has always been my favorite version on A Christmas Carol.\n",
      "The best movie directed then, what a cast. I would recommend it, to all. Especially when Scrooge gets visited by the spirits of Christmas, and he gets a second chance, not everybody can claim that. The best Christmas tale there is.\n",
      "One of the two or three greatest Christmas movies of all time and the best version of \"the Christmas Carol\" out there.  It is dark and scary, Alistair Sim is superb and the story is wonderfully done.\n",
      "A brilliant film, the definitive version of this classic story. After years of frustration, here is a terrific transfer with picture and sound better than I suspect many people saw and heard when this film was first seen in theaters. I'm glad I bought this Blu-Ray disk even though I already had last year's Blu-Ray transfer. This has gorgeous grays, solid blacks, fantastic detail and (finally!) crisp audio. Just remember to select the original mono track to escape the cavernous sound of the synthetic surround mix!\n",
      "Every year, for several years, this has been the one Christmas movie that I never fail to watch during the holidays (at least once).  This is the best adaptation of A Christmas Carol that I have ever seen.  Alastair Sim provides an excellent portrayal of Scrooge.  The black & white filming adds to the whole \"Classic\" feel of the movie (avoid any colorizations). Buy it on DVD to ensure many, many years of quality viewing.The only downfall to the DVD (unless I'm missing something) is that the listed \"Special Features\" don't seem to be there.  There is no introduction by Patrick Macnee or Bonus Technicolor cartoon feature.  The Cast Bios consist of Alastair Sim only.  Don't worry about that small lack of quality.  The movie is worth owning if your a Scrooge fan.  Buy it. You will not be disappointed.\n",
      "Of all the movies made about Scrooge and the Christmas Carol, this is my favorite.  The DVD was in excellent shape, price was right, I was well pleased.\n",
      "I love all the Christmas Carol movies, and I try to watch all of them at Christmas time. This one with Alastair Sims, is one of my favorite.\n",
      "I was searching for the H.V.Esmond version, which it contained so I was HAPPY.  It also contains the Simm version so it has to be Good.I did start to view the extras, which seemed interesting but will have to get back to them some other time.\n",
      "I remember watching this as a little girl on TV and jumped at the chance to own it. It is an old classic that brings back warm meemories of past holiday seasons.\n",
      "Alastair Sim is the reason to watch this 1951 version of Charles Dicken's Victorian Christmas classic as he really brings the old miser, Scrooge, to life in a believable manner.  The film is quite faithful to Dicken's original story and it expands on some themes from Scrooge's past that are just hinted at in the book.  We even get to see Marley as a young man at his first meeting with his future business partner in the Christmas past  sequence as well as getting some insight in to why Scrooge resents his nephew when he had been so fond of his sister.  The film is presented on a two disc set with plenty of interesting extras and the viewer has the choice of watching the rather cheap looking colorized version (I started watching that first which was probably a mistake) or the well restored black and white original.  Why then do I not give it five stars?  Though this version is very worthy I can think of three other available CHRISTMAS CAROL versions I prefer.  My favorite is the one starring George C. Scott, my next is the often overlooked version of the musical SCROOGE starring Albert Finney and the third, believe it or not, is the excellent Mr. Magoo cartoon which was my first ever introduction to THE CHRISTMAS CAROL and I still enjoy that too little seen classic with my family every holiday season.\n",
      "The perfect FAMILY movie to get you into the Christmas Spirit~Alistair Sims is impeccable as the best Scrooge ever.\n",
      "I really enjoy this particular Christmas Carol with Alistair Sim in it. The picture clarity was great. I like the fact that it is on DVD so I know it will last a long time.\n",
      "Don't miss this new version of a classic tale. This Christmas favorite has been improved without losing any of its original appeal. You can view in its original black and white or the new colorized production. I still prefer the black and white but I loved the colorized version when my entire family gathered for the Holidays.\n",
      "Great holiday fun. This movie should be a part of everyone's holiday movie lineup. Arrived in great condition like new\n",
      "Over the past few years it was getting much more difficult to find this version in the TV listings around Christmas time. I finally decided to purchase the DVD. I got a great deal through Amazon and am very happy with the quality of the DVD version. I like both the original and color versions. I know there was some concern about a missing part near the end, but it was hardly noticable and did not detract from the story. This is truly a Collector's Edition.\n",
      "I recommend this version of Dicken's, \"A Christmas Carol\" over any other version ever filmed.  It's a classic film, which means it has withstood the test of time and lost none of it's impact.\n",
      "FRIEND LOVED IT!  FAVORITE HOLIDAY MOVIE, FAVORITE VERSION, THOUGH LIKES BLACK-AND-WHITE VERSION BETTER. NOT MUCH ELSE TO SAY ABOUT IT.\n",
      "This diamond edition features an introduction by Leonard Maltin, a noted Hollywood film historian and contributor to Entertainment Tonight, before the actual film. The film is black and white. Even without color, the film is quite in tradition of Dickens in London of the 1840s. It's grim, depressing, and dark but it's supposed to be.Ebenezer Scrooge played brilliantly by the late great character actor, comedian, and genius performer, Alastair Sim, is in the title role. Every Scrooge since then has been compared to him and it's easy to see why. He's Oscar winning gold in his performance perhaps one of the finest roles in film history for an actor. The cast of characters included Mervyn Johns who played Bob Cratchit; Hermione Baddeley who played his wife; Kathleen Harrison as his housekeeper; Michael Hordern played the older Jacob Marley; Patrick Macnee played the younger Marley; George Cole played the younger Scrooge; Hattie Jacques even has a small part.The film's cast and the director, Alan Desmond Hurst, are brilliant in displaying the harshness of Scrooge's time. This DVD pays homage in showing a documentary about the late Irish film director and his contributions to the film industry by his executor and nephew Allan Esler Smith.There is another documentary about Christmas Carol and it's endless adaptations. This DVD also features the original American and British cinema trailers. They even include silent films such as the 1922 Scrooge and the 1922 Bleak House (another of Dickens' novels).If you love the Scrooge film, you will love this wonderful DVD and will make a perfect gift for anybody this time of year.\n",
      "Of ALL of the multitudes of versions of \"A Christmas Carol\" this has always, ALWAYS been my favorite. There is simply nothing lacking in this portrayal. The modernized versions may please some crowds but it seems to me that everyone I talk to in my own circle of friends seem to agree that this version has all of the elements of emotional extremes....One can feel the genuine terror of Scrooge during his late night visits and the horror of the future he sees, yet oddly enough there are those very special moments that \"peek out\" through his facial expressions - a softening of the eyes, a slight tear or gentle furrough of the brow...a wave of tenderness in his face as he recalls the kindness of his former employer or the love he bore for his frail and kind-hearted sister.This version of \"A Christmas Carol\" is unique in that it reveals the characters as I would envision the actual author of the book had intended rather than the typical Hollywood versions which always seem to overplay the characters and cheapen the characters. This version brings out the depth of character of virtually all of the characters in the film, and the actor who played Tiny Tim was a winning pick for a little tot so full of pure innocence!\n",
      "If the Alistair Sim version of A Christmas Carol is your favorite, then this DVD set is for you. They've cleaned up the version you've seen a million times and it looks fresh and sparkly. You'll see details you never noticed before. You'll hear dialogue you missed before. They even have a short feature demonstrating and explaining the clean-up process.In addition, there's a colorized version of the same film that looks fabulous. Colorizing has come a long way in the past few years. There's also an earlier British production of A Christmas Carol (or Scrooge, as it is titled in Britain) which runs less than an hour in its entirety. It's interesting as a curiosity only - the short length means they left out a lot of the story and if you didn't already know the story, you would be rather lost.There are lots of other extra commentaries and an interview with George Cole, who plays the young Ebenezer Scrooge to Alistair Sim's older Scrooge. You may remember George Cole as Henry Root, or as the banker in the Royal Command Performance of Good Neighbors. And Patrick Macnee does an uninspired introduction to the movie. He played a small role as young Jacob Marley in the film.So, if you love this version of A Christmas Carol, you will really appreciate this remastered edition. Personally, I prefer the later version with George C. Scott as Scrooge.\n",
      "Alistair Sim is amazing and this is a must see for everyone!  He turns into the most joyful soul at the end--so heartwarming!\n",
      "I agree with everyone who feels this is the very best version of this story ever put to film.  Everything about it is wonderful; but indeed, it is the acting in the scenes following the visits by the Ghosts which makes this movie stand out.  Anyone who watches those scenes, wherein Scrooge is rejoicing, without feeling it in his or her own heart is a real life Scrooge... and a humbug!This is one of my very favorite movies ever.\n",
      "I have loved this movie since the first time I watched it. First of all, the movie really gives the feel of the time period. You just feel like you've been transported back in time. But the big reason for the success of this version is the portrayal of Scrooge, played by Alastair Sim. He is as unreasonable man as there can be, but is completely transformed once visited by the four spirits. Those visits really paint a picture of how a kind, young Scrooge became such a hardened soul through loss of loved ones and loss of love, accompanied by greed. A must see for everyone, this \"Christmas Carol\" is the only version you ever need to see.\n",
      "This is my husband favorite Christmas carol is it is just the best. The emerald edition didn't change it but enhanced it. Awesome\n",
      "I didnt realize when I purchased this DVD that it was colorized, I thought I was getting black and white.  I do love this rendition of Scrooge.  My family and I enjoyed it very much, even if it wasnt in black and white---the colorizing was pretty good.\n",
      "A few years ago, I lost my copy of this movie, and will get it again as soon as possible.  But this movie is the ULTIMATE CHRISTMAS CAROL.  Mr. Sims does a marvelous job as Ebenezer Scrooge.  Mr. Patrick MacNee as a young Jacob Marley is a bonus.If you want to watch a Chrismas Carol with the whole family, this is the one that should be viewed.\n",
      "This is one of the two best versions of A Christmas Carol ever (the other being the 1938 version).  Highly recommend owing and loving both.\n",
      "I don't really have to write anything do I?????The life of a Scrooge transformed by the Love of a friends. Watch both though I do really prefer the black & white one just being nostalgic.\n",
      "There are many versions of this classic story available but this is by far the best. Alistair Sim is perfect as Scrooge but the entire cast does a terrific job. I believe this should be in everyone's library to be viewed during Christmas.\n",
      "my sister wanted the simms version of carol (told her i would check amazon) found this one on the site purchased it kept the colector version gave her the regular copy i already had\n",
      "My wife's favorite Christmas Carol version.  She was very happy to receive it.\n",
      "I watched all the different versions of this story, even the female versions.My opinion is no one can top A Christmas Carol better than Sims.T\n",
      "Alastair Sim is the only actor that can bring Charles Dickens to life !  He is grand in the Past, Present, and Future scenes and his change to the \"good\" is done to perfection.The other \"attempts\" to copy pale by comparison !\n",
      "MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH LOVE THE ORIGINAL \"CHRISTMAS CAROL\" MOVIES.  WE HAVE SEVERAL OF THEM AND WE HAVE GIVEN COPIES OF THEM TO OUR CHILDREN FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS.\n",
      "A true Christmas classic to view.The story is enlightening and a true favorite at the holiday season.No matter how many times you've seen this you never forget the story.\n",
      "Love the reason for the season, and the original movies during this time of year.Still waiting for the other Christmas Carol movie I ordered, to enjoy.\n",
      "A great classic Christmas movie. Not on TV much anymore during the Christmas season so great to have it available.\n",
      "This is truly the best version of The Christmas Carol. You may want to view the 1935 version too, but this story has more details and interest!\n",
      "A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens is the perfect Christmas story. The 1951 version of the story starring Alastair Sim as the miserly Scrooge is the perfect version of the book. And now thanks to advanced restoration technology, we have the perfect version of the movie.This has always been a Christmas favorite in our house. Every year as my wife and I help Santa put the presents under the tree, we watch the ghosts show the miserly Scrooge his past and how he has allowed the evils of the world to turn his heart, the present and how the joys of Christmas are for all people no matter how poor, and the future and how what we leave behind depends on how we lived. Alastair Sim is perfect in the role showing us that Scrooge isn't evil but rather that Scrooge hates all men, no less himself, because of the suffering and death he has endured. When Scrooge changes, and no actor does a better job of changing from \"bad Scrooge\" to \"good Scrooge\", we cheer that the good man who was always in him has been allowed to burst free.This DVD has been restored using the original masters of the film and advanced computer technology. Nearly perfect, it makes the earlier versions look muddy which we can see in the short comparison of the two provided as an extra. The extras themselves are worth the price. An audio commentary is provided by Robert Cole who played the young Scrooge in the film. Cole actually lived with Sim when Cole was an up and coming actor and has many stories to share. Richard Gordon (who provided the funding for the film) relates the interesting story of how the movie was created in the short about George Minter and Renown Pictures. The package also includes as a bonus, the colorized (but not restored) version of the movie (which I will never watch) and the 1935 movie, \"Scrooge\" starring Sir Seymour Hicks in what is a fairly good version of the book.There are a few Christmas movies that must be watched each year and this version of A Christmas Carol is absolutely one of them. And now that it is available in restored form it is even more of a must-see version. No movie version is closer to the work of Charles Dickens and no team of actors does a better job of bringing Victorian England to life on the screen. This is not to be missed. Merry Christmas!\n",
      "It is great to get it in black and white. In the b&w version I can feel the glom and chill  in the story's beginning.\n",
      "Two months ago my mom told me that this was the movie her and my grandpa would watch every year on Christmas Eve. It's great to be able to carry on the family tradition with this classic.\n",
      "This is the best portrayal of ebeneezer scrooge ever done.  Alastair Sim shows the true depth of emotion that Dickens intended for his most famous character.  The conversion from a bitter old miser to the kindest gentleman the old city ever saw has been lost with most other actors but Sim captures the transition materfully.  The black and white adds to the mood and the dialogue is not covered over by digital gadgets.  It is the only version of this classic tale that I have ever felt the need to expose my daughter to and it instantly became her favorite version of the story too........and she otherwise hates Dickens!  A true classic withstands the transition from one generation to another.\n",
      "It's quite fun to read the reviews of the different versions of this film and see how opinions view on which is the best.  My own person list of the best versions would go like this:1) Alastair Sim version2) George C. Scott version3) patrick Stewart Version4) Reginald Owen Version5) Albert Finney Musical Version6) Seymour Hicks version.Note I do not include the novelty versions such as Scrooged, Muppets, or any animated version.Each and every version has taken poetic license with the Dickens material and either added scenes or deleted scenes from the original version.  The Sim version is no different.  Scenes such as Scrooge visiting Marley on his death bed and showing in a flashback how Scrooge & Marley first came to control their company were not in Dickens' original story.  I don't have much of a problem with that as it is merely to beef up the background and doesn't change the story,On the other hand, in the Reginald Owen version, Scrooge actually fires Bob Cratchit for ruining his hat after knocking it off Scrooges head by a snowball!!!  Now THAT is a major change and one reason why I rate the Owen version so low.The Sim version benefits from a great English cast including Michael Hordern as Marley's ghost, kathleen Harrison as Mrs. Dilber, and the incomparable Ernest Thesiger as the undertaker.  If you're looking for pure Dicken's there's nothing closer to the book and more instilled with Dickens pure spirit than the scene in Old Joe's parlor as the maid, laundress, and undertaker come to sell off the goods taken from the dead Ebenezer Scrooge.But at the end of the day this version is the best because Sim was simply the best SCrooge.  He did not go over the top like Finney and Stewart, nor underplay the role like Owen did.  He comes as close to my vision of Scrooge as any actor to play the role.One note..another reviewer said Pactick Macnee (of Avengers fame) played Tiny Tim.  That was incorrect. Macnee actually played the young Jacob Marley in the scene where he and SCrooge first meet.I'll watch any version of this film because I love it but this IS the BEST!\n",
      "Grew up with the black and white version, my favorite of all time, so it's nice to have both color and b/w on the same disk. There are a lot of versions of this classic but this one makes you think the story could actually happen!\n",
      "I own this one & the one with Patrick Stewart! I like them both!\n",
      "Alastair Sim's performance is hard to beat as his Scrooge is done so well, so despicable in the beginning and so giddily child-like after he learns his lesson. This movie to me is a classic which should be watched every Christmas. The sets superbly capture the atmosphere of the time and the actors all seem to be expertly cast for their roles. Just an enjoyable film which should be in every movie buffs movie library. If you have not seen this version of A Christmas Carol, you are missing something special.\n",
      "This was bought for my Grandma because she likes the \"older\" movies instead of the new ones of today.She absolutely LOVED it!This brought such a smile to her face, it was wonderful!Great service and shipping!\n",
      "The best Christmas movie ever made.\n",
      "This is one of my long-time favorites. As kids way-back-when... lol... we used to sit and watch this movie every year. We always looked forward to seeing it on the tv. Now I own not only the original black & white version, but also the colorized version. With both versions being on the same disc, I can watch the b&w one from my past, or watch the colorized one with my grandkids.\n",
      "This is my favorite version of A Christmas Carol.  I know there are a lot of good ones, but this one speaks to my heartstrings.  Also, for your information, there is one scene in this movie where a stage hand can be seen coming from the back, sees the camera and scampers back in.  A treasure.\n",
      "One of the best if not THE best version of this classic Dickens tale.  While the others did their best to bring Scrooge to the big screen, Alistair Sim brings the character to life.\n",
      "My best Christmas movie ever, Mr. Simms is the best Scrooge ever, he reallyy plays the part. I watch this every year.\n",
      "We are fans and really like the colorized version. others do not include the colorized copy. Unfortunately there are breaks in the colored version with a conversation about the film. Very unnecessary and a distraction\n",
      "I am extremely happy with this purchase! I haven't seen this film for 4 years now. I don't have cabel & it's not avilable in the stores anymore. I just want to say that I almost did a great dis-service to the Seller because I hadn't received the product but tonight I had a hunch the package was misplaced, in the mail boxes area of my building & sure enough it was!! I will gladly purchase movies from this Seller again, she's honest & very reliable. Happy holidays to everybody....I'm so happy!! This is 1 of my favorite Christmas time movies. Look forward to watcing it. Sincerely, Tracy J./Chicago, IL\n",
      "Alistair Sims is PERFECT.  No other version of this film holds a candle to this one.  George C. Scott's performance, in my opinion, is overblown, overacted.  The emotional payoff at the end is thrilling, deeply moving.  I watch this at least once a month, love it!  Also recommended: Hoffman, with Peter Sellers, another gem.\n",
      "The best..of all the versions I've seen.  Followed by the 1938 version.  Love this and we will watch it every year at Christmas.\n",
      "This company exceeded my expectations. Not only was the DVD very affordable, its quality is outstanding. I would recommend this company without hesitation.\n",
      "This is one of my all-time Christmas favorites since I was a kid.  The picture and sound quality are great as well for such an old movie.\n",
      "I think every one should  see the Christmas Carol  starting as a child. I like to watch it every year.  It brings back memories.\n",
      "Ever since I was little, my family has watched this version of this classic on Christmas Eve. This DVD, with both versions is an absolute must have for fans of this movie, the picture is beautiful, the sound is wonderful. Now I won't have to miss my favorite ever again, and no commercials.\n",
      "This is the real one A Christmas Carol BY Charles Dickens with Alastair Sim...I only asked one thing watch it in B/W I watch this one every year\n",
      "I loved this movie as a child and being able to get it now is wonderful. Movie is clear and sound is terrific. I am so glad I got this movie.\n",
      "i wont know till Christmas ,one doesn't play these only at the right time. But I am sure I will delighted Thanks\n",
      "We have always loved the Alistair Sim version of A Chirstmas Carol and it was a tradition to watch it on Christmas Day.  But we only had it on Video Tape and it was getting worn out, so we purchased the DVD and was not disappointed. It was in black and white which is the only way to watch this classic Dickens Tale. And the bonus is at the end of the video - the bonus parts there were scenes on how the cinematic version was converted to DVD and the scratches were fixed when it was transferred from the film.\n",
      "This was priceless to my husband and myself.  It has the entire cast and partial biographies.  It was interesting and very infomrative.  Anyone who loves the old movies and particularly this A christmas Carol with Alistair Sims will NEVER be disappointed.  My only mistake was waiting til l Christmas to buy it, prior to December it was $9.99...but I waited til December and it went up to $13.99, still that was an excellent price AND I can't find this particular edition and movie anywhere else!! Amazon comes thru again.  This was brand new...not used.\n",
      "Fantastic!! Now I can watch anytime I like to watch. In the end of the movie, he make me laugh. He's wonderful person. Have a nice weekend. Thank you, Vicki\n",
      "Acording to IMDB.com and Maltin, it was indeed Patrick MacNee playing the young Marley. Glyn Dearman played Tiny Tim.\n",
      "one of my fave Christmas movies of all time....our family really enjoyed it!! such a classic! yay! yay! yay!yay! yay!\n",
      "No actor could surpass Alistair Sim in the role of Ebeneezer Scrooge.  The black and white filming makes the story all the more haunting!\n",
      "I bought this for Christmas eve viewing as my family has not seen this version.  We really enjoyed it.  Also,  the service at Kings College is worth viewing if you can find it on dvd.  It makes for a British Christmas feel, especially if you are an Anglo American.\n",
      "I admire this film for its atmospheric evocation of Victorian London, but there have always been elements in the adaptation that have struck a discordant note. First, as excellent as Sim is as Scrooge, he strikes me as too hale and hearty for Dickens' creation of frozen old features, shriveled cheek, stiffened gait, and pointed nose. Even so, the performance is a classic. For that matter, Mr. and Mrs. Cratchit don't appear to have suffered much at the table from their \"15 bob\" weekly salary.I've loved the story ever since it was read, en famille, as part of the Christmas rituals of my childhood. I have always been puzzled why the screen writer (or the producer) decided to insert the novelty of Scrooge's mother having died at his birth as the reason for his being sent away to school. The novella only tells us that he is neglected. Furthermore, Dickens describes the sister Fan as \"much younger\" than Ebenezer. I suppose this could be explained by her being a half sister, but Ebenezer contradicts that notion that their \"dear Mama\" must have looked much like Fan at the time of her death. The substitution of Alice for Belle as Scrooge's fiancee does little enough harm. Omitting the novella's scene of Belle/Alice's domestic happiness on the Christmas Eve of Marley's death, in favor of Alice's 'Christmas present' nursing in a bedlam-like hospital, fails to drive home the point of the happiness Scrooge threw away years before. Scrooge's emotions at seeing Belle's daughter and his realization that \"such another creature, quite as graceful and full of promise, might have called him father, and been a springtime in the haggard winter of his life\" is a key element in his emotional reclamation.The screenwriter tends to beat us over the head concerning Scrooge's sharp business practices. The early scene between Scrooge and the debtor Wilkins has no parallel in the novella. The scene between the young Scrooge and Marley as clerks is not Dickens, nor is the board meeting where the two partners rescue the Amalgamated Mercantile from the embezzlement of a fellow director by buying the company. The  scene between the dying Marley and Scrooge, where the former has a deathbed conversion regarding his life, is similarly an invention of the screenwriter.Kathleen Harrison's popular (at the time) cockney schtick probably accounts for the expansion of Mrs. Dilber's role from her only appearance in the novella's rag and bone shop, where she vends Scrooge's stolen bed curtains, to the messenger of Marley's approaching demise and witness of Scrooge's regeneration after the supernatural visits. Tiny Tim is given clairvoyant powers in an invented scene in which he declares the anonymous turkey a gift from Scrooge.Scrooge's penitent Christmas Day encounter with the two gentlemen collecting for charity, whom he essentially threw out of his office on Christmas Eve, is omitted. The omission damages the overall conclusion. Scrooge is newly charitable toward his employee, Cratchit. He has returned to the family fold in reconciling with his nephew, Fred. The deleted scene shows us his intent to make amends to his fellow man as a whole.As others have noted, the blu-ray disc is sharper in image than the standard DVD but shows scratches, occlusions, and audio drop outs that don't disfigure the older version.My grousing about the screenplay aside, I do think this is a classic. However, to get the full measure of Dickens' humanity, generosity, and skill as a story teller in a concentrated timespan, you have to read his novella.\n",
      "I've always enjoyed watching this movie. It''s just not the holidays until I've see it.Have fun watching it like I do.\n",
      "This CD is great if you have ever watched scrooge ,brings back the good times in life forme when I was young,I know you will enjoy watching this,this opions comes from a manin his sixtys,buy it,you won't be sorry,and it might even get you in the christmas spirit earlywalt a\n",
      "There are so many great Christmas movies, and there are many more terrible ones. Then there is Sim's A Christmas Carol. This isn't just a great Christmas movie, this is a great ghost story, a great tragic love story, it's a great movie. I've been skeptical about blu ray's use on black and white movies, but this is a gorgeous representation on the format. This is the best version of a Christmas Carol and there are many good versions out there. The Owens, Scott, and Stewart versions are all terrific and have their place but each are at the foot of Sim's version. This is a movie that can withstand multiple viewings and it should also be watched at other times besides Christmas, it's that good.\n",
      "This is the definitive Christmas Carol.  Alastair Sim's portrayal of Scrooge is nonpariel.  The protrayal of Jacob Marley is superb as is that of Bob Crachett.  During the scene when Scrooge is looking in the mirror, after his conversion, look for a stage hand appearing in the background in the mirror.  I found out about this in a video magazine years ago.  Fascinating find.\n",
      "This version of the Christmas Coral with Alastair Sim \"IS\", without question, the all best film production of this story that has ever been produced. It not likely that any one can ever top Alastair Sim's performance. I pleased to see that this wonderful film has now been released on DVD. I WILL be getting a DVD copy of this movie as soon as I can.\n",
      "Brings back the good memories of preparing for Christmas.  The best Scrooge of the lot!  (Jacob Marley is no slouch here, either!)\n",
      "This classic Christmas Carol with the incomparable Alistair Sims brings out Dickens classic story as one of the best Christmas Carols ever.\n",
      "I bought this for a family member that wanted this movie classic for their collection. It is as advertised and I would recommend this to anyone interested in this movie in DVD format.\n",
      "This is the best version of A Christmas Carol ever made. The acting is superb, led by what would today be an Oscar-winning performance by Alistair Sim.The darkness of the film is brightened by the facial expressions and animated behaviour of Scrooge as he is confronted by his past and future.His redemption at the end demonstrates that happiness comes in sharing time and riches with those around us and no man is alone who has a friend.\n",
      "The most significant Christmas film ever made. Certainly the truest and most emotionally stirring adaptation of Dickens' classic to this day, and most certainly to come. How do I know this? Well, in the words of Tiny Tim, \"I just think it\". The aged condition of the film and the fact that it was shot in black and white lend a certain authenticity to it, as if it were actually filmed in the story's time period. Alastair Sim was born to play Scrooge. Even some of the finest actors can't (and won't) ever approach the level he set. He was the \"model Scrooge\". Sim was as equally convincing as a heartless miser as he was a man enlightened, redeemed and reborn. Other fine actors could play one or the other but not both, at least, not convincingly. Sim is also supported by a very strong cast and crew. This classic version has Heart; It has Spirit like no other; It has believability; It has purpose. Just the sight of a poor little boy (Tiny Tim) peering through a toy shop window and managing a smile even though he knows he'll never have any of the toys he sees will be indelibly etched into your conscience. The music during that scene will stay with you for many seasons to come. Somebody did a commendable job restoring this treasure. Even the standard DVD (also restored and included) looks and sounds far better than any prior home video release, but it's still not perfect. Nevertheless, great strides in its restoration were made and I highly recommend it. But as far as the story goes, watch it alone the first time, without interruption, and if you find yourself touched and perhaps rubbing a tear from your eye at the end when you hear the words, \"Can you forgive a pig-headed old fool...\", ahhh, you're there. Merry Christmas, \"in keepin' with the situation\".\n",
      "Ok, we all have seen Scrooge, in one form or another, since we were kids, yet, its Christmas!!I have seen every version, even the earliest, and none can compare to this one! Alastair Sim is the for real Scrooge..brilliant, mean and just as I imagined..Will I ever get bored with watching \"A Christmas Carol\"? most likely not! Now I have the classic collectors edition, which is in in color and black and white.The color doesnt distract, it looks natural, and is fun to see.The collectors edition! I recommend it highly!\n",
      "Classic for a reason.  Superb.\n",
      "I've loved this movie since childhood...Alistair Sim is the finest Scrooge ever, and there have been many...Owning this in color, and on Blu-ray is a great Christmas gift to myself...and I think it should be in every household !If you want to get the Christmas spirit - get this wonderful movie...it will warm your heart and delight your soul...It's a wonderful bargain...an' a genuine classic.\n",
      "I had taped this a few year ago but lost the tape.  Bought the DVD and saw it over Christmas and it was as good as ever.  The black and white version is really good.\n",
      "This rendition is true to Dickin's work.  Alastair Sim's humorous and spirited portrayal of Scrooge is the best I have seen.\n",
      "The ultimate Scrooge, the only version as far as I am concerned, nothing else can come close to Alastair Sim as Scrooge, I watch it faithfully every year at Christmas.\n",
      "I just can't imagine how you could make this great movie any better, except perhaps the Ghost of Christmas Past beingplayed by Ann Rutherford (who played it in the Reginald Owen version of this movie). Alastair Sim, of course, does a superbjob playing Scrooge, he's so believable in this from the start to the finish. But the guy (Michael Hordern) who plays Marley'sghost does an unbelievable job. I think this movie has to be played by English actors, you get the real feeling of CharlesDickens' London in the 1830's. Christmas would not be complete for me without seeing this show at least once. It's rarelyon the networks on Christmas eve any more, so that's why I purchased this DVD, so I can view whether it's on TV or not.\n",
      "I have watched \"A Christmas Carol\" many, many times since the early nineteen fifties, usually the AlistaIr Sim rendition.  It never gets old.  This film should be required viewing for all children across the world, not for it's religious message, but for it's moral lesson. The world is indebted to Charles Dickens and his commitment to social justice.WWKenney  1/15/13\n",
      "anyone who views A Christmas Carol has to watch this version, it is a great reference point to start with.\n",
      "Of all versions produced, this 1953 version, Alastair Sim's provides a superb performance & now it is the only version my family views\n",
      "I've owned a version of this movie for many years, beginning with the purchase of a VHS copy from the University of Washington in Seattle sometime in the 70s. But as I progressed to DVD versions, it wasn't until I got a colorized copy that some scenes made sense. For instance, the scene where Tiny Tim is looking through the front window of a toy shop -- there had always been toys I could make neither head nor tail of. Another was the scene where the Ghost of Christmas Past transported Scrooge into the snow covered fields of his youth. In that scene both Scrooge and the ghost were filmed to appear transparent and, so, were difficult to make out in black and white.So the colorized version was a big improvement in so far as the ability to quickly identify the objects in each scene. Has this much improved black and white version eliminated the problem? It's difficult to say since I already know what the objects are. Do I believe the artistic intent of a movie is ruined by colorizing? No, that choice may have been dictated by the money available to make the film.I have many older movies in black and white, which I have no desire to see in color. But in this case, I believe it adds to the movie -- it's not a horror film best seen in black and white only.\n",
      "Wonderful old classic without fancy special effects.  True to the original story. Reminiscent of a time when Christmas was a happy family event without the hype and commercial emphasis.\n",
      "What can I say, it's a classic now available on blu-ray, it's timeless.  My little one has never seen the movie before, so it was fun to share it + the quality of the blu-ray made it even more enjoyable for me to see it again\n",
      "There are many versions of this classic Dickens tale, but none better than this one. Alistair Sim's is the definitive portrayal of Scrooge, a far more complex and three dimensional character than most of us would think. The DVD offers a nice extras package that gives the viewer much insight into how the struggles of life in post-war England helped shape this version into something a bit darker - and yet ultimately more hopeful - than any other. A total winner on all levels.\n",
      "Produced in 1951, in B&W;, A Christmas Carol is most likely the best of all the versions of the famous Dickens tale.  In the lead role Sir Alastair Sim delivers a wonderfully compelling characterization of Ebenezer Scrooge.  Sir Alastair Sim's comic and dramatic abilities will have you glued to your seat.This is a MUST HAVE for your holiday movie collection.\n",
      "Somehow, across the years, the story of Ebenezer Scrooge and his three ghosts has been transformed from it's spooky roots to light-hearted family fare.  Scrooge is not so much evil, as grumpy.  The ghost's tend to amuse rather than frighten.This black-and-white version of \"A Christmas Carol\" maintains the horror roots of the story.  Jacob Marley is one of the most frightening ghosts to haunt the silver screen.  He grows intolerant of the idea that Scrooge is not frightened, and howls his rage and frustration.  The Ghost of Christmas Past is an impersonal specter, cold and distant.  Present is jolly and yet quick to anger.  Future is the grim shade that he is supposed to be.The back story of Scrooge is told in greater detail here than in any other version.  He resents Fred, not because of his Christmas cheer but because his birth caused the death of Scrooge's beloved sister.  He not only remembers the good times at Fezzywig's, he remembers putting Fezzywig out of business later in life.  Alastair Sim brings this character to fullness more than any other actor.  The Christmas morning scene is  a delight, and worth the wait.As a bonus, the Fleischer \"Rudolph the Rednose Reindeer\" is included on this disk.  This is clearly Santa Claus by the people who gave us the first animated Superman.  The animation is fluid and dynamic.  One of the best extras on any DVD.\n",
      "Warm the eggnog, gather the family together, and enjoy the absolutely best version of A Christmas Carol ever produced...period.A true classic...timeless!\n",
      "WONDERFUL HOLIDAY MOVIE! A TRUE CLASSIC, A TIMELESS TREASURE TO WATCH EVERY HOLIDAY SEASON. WONDERFUL TRADITION! GREAT STORY AND A MOST WONDERFUL MOVIE.\n",
      "Love this movie. My absolute favorite Christmas Movie. I just had to order it because 24 hours of this movie is not enough. (:\n",
      "This has been one of our favorite X-Mas movies and has now become my daughter in law's top rated X-Mas movie.\n",
      "This is a favorite movie we always enjoy.  Tis a family tradition to get together after tree trimming, sit down with a bowl of popcorn and just laugh.\n",
      "The Movie \"A Christmas Story\" came out in the early 1980's and has remained a prominent Christmas classic to present time. The imagery is of Christmas in Indiana in what appears to be the 1950's or early 60's.  This is really the story of a whimsical boy (Ralphie) who will stop at no lengths to seduce his parents into buying him the Red Rider B.B. gun his boyhood passion craves.  There are many twists and turns throughout the movie; everything from the \"electric sex\" like lamp that suddenly breaks, to  a youth defining confrontation with a school yard bully. A simpler time in America History when people enjoyed Christmas, said \"Merry Christmas\", and could possibly even leave their door unlocked. This is a movie every family should watch over and over again during the Christmas season. A rare treasure by modern day standards.Merry Christmas, and God Bless you... :)\n",
      "This is a basic disk with no menu or additional options, but that is kind of nice for a classic like this one.  No need to see bloopers or alternate endings, just enjoy the great video and audio quality.\n",
      "A Christmas Story easily ranks as one of the top 5 Christmas themed movies of all time.  The acting is fantastic, the storyline is typical of almost every child that desparately want tSanta to bring them hat one important present.  I even watch this movie during the non-holiday months as it just reminds me of my childhood when my worries were few.\n",
      "theres this kid,ralphie,whose trying to convince the world he needs a red runner bb gun for his x-mas present.this story is abselutely precious and is very well written.everything thay happens is adorable!its good from end to end!the fun never stops.the kids will like it as the writer has a keen insight into a childs mind.the funniest thing i think anyone said was when ralphie was trying to help his dad change the tire by holding the lugs for him.he dropped them (...) then the voice over says only i didnt say fudge,i said the almighty holy mother of all cuss words (...)it was great!its in the top 4 best x-mas stories ever behind silent night deadly night,a nightmare before christmas and the bad santa.everybody should like this.if you dont,youre a demon from hell with no heart.ralphies mom is pretty in a girl on the side mid class kinda way.theres this bad kid who always beats up ralphie.hes a real pain.hes much older but ralphie eventualy snaps and lays the smack!the entire cast deserves an award.the message is dreamers can prevail,if tactful.this movie is a classic!\n",
      "From the wool jackets with fur trim, to the tacky leg .... a fun time for all.  Remember, don't put your tongue on flag pole\n",
      "Definitely the best Christmas movie.  It doesn't get better than this!  It's loved by every member of my family from age 3 to age 85, including teens, young adults, parents, and elementary aged kids.  Can't beat it!\n",
      "A Christmas without A Christmas Story is unheard of around these parts.  I have been watching this classic since I was a child.  From the first time on VHS to DVD and now Blu-ray.  This story is probably one of the best Christmas tales to come around the past 25 years.  So how does this HD version stack up against all the others?  Very well if you must know.For all of you familiar and unfamiliar with the story it takes place in Cleveland, Ohio in the 1940's.  An America many people seem to remember fondly.  The story centers around a boy named Ralphy and his Christmas wish to have a Red Rider BB gun.  Of course the adults all seem to feel the gun is unsafe and you the repeated phrase, \"You'll shoot your eye out.\"  Although this is really just a small part of the story.Ralphy is like many boys of his age then and now.  On the cusp of adolescence while still having his childish tendencies.  During the movie you get to know his friends and all the people around him.  Every time I watch this movie I realize how much things are the same when it comes to Christmas in middle class America.  This story seems to tell it better and more realistically than most movies made.Now if you have not bought this movie on DVD it is a great value.  The picture is only mildly improved from it's DVD version.  Sometimes you will be wondering if it's really in HD.  Although despite that this is a great movie.  Christmas or not it is a classic.  The Blu-ray version comes with some extras like a anniversary follow up with a few of the child actors.  Although that is not entirely exciting the movie is.\n",
      "This is our family's favorite Christmas movie. It's perfect for all ages! The narrator does a great job throughout the movie helping us all to recall fond memories of our childhood Christmases. You'll be giggling throughout the movie!\n",
      "Classic.Epic.Masterpiece.These are the only words needed to describe \"A Christmas Story, the greatest Christmas movie of the last 10 million years\n",
      "The film begins in winter, children await Christmas. The cars suggest the 1930s. Kids view a department store window. Ralphie sees the one toy he wants: a Red Ryder BB gun. People listen to \"The Lone Ranger\". Mother knows there is danger with such a toy. [Ralphie's fantasies reflect the cowboy movies of the 1930s.] Remember those snow suits? Would they act up in class? Would they stick out their tongue? What do they want for Christmas? What did his Dad win? How do the piggies eat? What an artistic lamp? They don't make them like that anymore! Remember 15 minute radio programs? Remember tires that often went flat? Getting your mouth washed out with soap? [Was 'Lava' worse than 'Lifebuoy'?] \"A crummy commercial!\"Ralph's father fights with the furnace. His Mom has an accident with that lamp. Ralphie learns about peaceful coexistence in the alley. Can he ask Santa for that BB gun? We see an elaborate Christmas parade from that era. Santa Claus warns him about that BB gun. Christmas arrives, Santa left a load of toys. Aunt Clara sent a special gift for Ralphie. Isn't it cute? \"What's that behind the desk?\" Ralphie learns that a BB gun is dangerous when not properly supervised. [A metal backing ricochets towards the shooter.] An open door is dangerous when there are hungry dogs outside. Where can they find a restaurant on Christmas Day? They'll always remember that day.Jean Parker Shephard had a late-night radio show from the late 1950s to the late 1970s. He would reminisce about the days of yesteryear, as in this film. He wrote books during this era. The fact that he lost an eye in childhood was a secret. You can surmise the cause. Any gun is a danger when mishandled by an inexperienced child. BB air guns were originally designed as a toy or tool for adults or responsible children. If you remember another version you'll know they were more explicit about the damage to the eyeglasses. This film shows how commercials to children are used to control buying by adults.\n",
      "I wanted to own this movie as it is a classic with lots of laughs and it brings back memories of days gone by.  Very funny\n",
      "A Christmas Story is still one of the most endearing and hilarious christmas films of all-time. Directed by the late Bob Clark, A Christmas Story is about a 9 year old, Ralphie (played by the adorable Peter Billingsely) who wants a BB gun for Christmas. I can not tell how good this film is, I watch this two-disc special edition every December and it's defintely worth the money. I love, love, love this film and if you have been living under a rock since 1983, you will love it too, it's a guarantee. Happy viewing!\n",
      "This movie reminds me so much of my childhood, including the snowsuits!  And the coal stove in the cellar is exactly what we had to deal with until I was 12 years old, in Philadelphia.  Even the Christmas windows in the department store were what my father and mother would take us to see, every year, downtown.  We had a wonderful store called Wanamaker's where there was a train which went around the ceiling every Christmas for children…this takes me down memory lane every year, and every year I laugh out loud!\n",
      "Not only did my video that I ordered arrive in great condition, but it arrived before the estimated arrival time. Fantastic customer service!!Thank you!\n",
      "My family has been watching this film every holiday season for over 20 years.  No Christmas movie collection is complete without it!\n",
      "An absolute classic movie. Perfect example of Americano movie!!!! Everyone has to watch this movie at least once in their life.  I own it in vhs, dvd, and now blu-ray\n",
      "One of the movies that define the holiday season. The amazing point is that it reached this pinnacle in the modern era.\n",
      "classic story got it for a gift exchange it was a hit everyone loves this story.i may have to buy another copy for my kids and i\n",
      "This movie is a true classic and it is the most watched chrismas movie of all times.This is a must watch for kids and adults. It is approiate for all ages of children.I grew up with this movie and as many times as iv seen it I always find something to laugh at.And the fact that it was based on the guys childhood makes it all the more enjoyable.\n",
      "This is an awesome movie! I watch it every Christmas and now that I bought it, I can watch it all the time. Who doesn't love Ralphie?!\n",
      "C'mon, this movie is a classic.  Not only did I grow up like that, I was raised in Hammond, Indiana and attended Harding Grade School.  You have to watch A Christmas Story every Christmas.\n",
      "This movie has captured, with great accuracy, the Spirit of Christmas in America.  Heartwarming memories of childhood during the 1950's and early 1960's, remind of a devilish, but kinder, less devided society.  Much of the humor is crafted by the smaller details, I, a babyboomer, had completely forgot\n",
      "This is another old movie that I wanted for my personal satisfaction. I think it is one of the greatest and best, especially at Christmas time of the year. And am afraid that someday, it will not be shown on television.\n",
      "Every man, woman and child needs to watch this.  It covers aspects of our childhoods from department store Santas to getting beaten up as a kid and finally coming unglued and beating up the bully, from Dad going overboard as we dads do and Mom trying to keep the peace as moms do, to the agony of hinting and hoping for that favorite Christmas present.  It answers the age old question of what happens when one touches the flag pole with one's tongue in the winter.  It even teaches you a ready-made warning for use when someone you care about wants to do something dangerous.Watch this movie.\n",
      "This is a great Christmas movie. It's nice to have when the 24hr Christmas special is over, a nice thing to relive over and over.\n",
      "Terrific story for all ages. I watched it with my 7-year old daughter and we both had a blast laughing!\n",
      "WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT A MOVIE THAT CRACKS ME UP!?!  I'M 27 YEARS OLD AND EVERYTIME I WATCH THIS MOVIE I TURN INTO A LITTLE KID... ONE OF MY FAVORITE SCENES IS WHEN RALPHIE AND THE FAMILY HAVE TO EAT CHRISTMAS DINNER AT A CHINESE RESTAURANT AND HEARING THE WAITERS SING DECK THE HALLS JUST KILLS ME.  AND NO ONE CAN FORGET WHEN FLICK IS DARED BY HIS CLASSMATES TO STICK HIS TONGUE ON THE FLAGPOLE... (laughs)ANYWAYS, I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THIS MOVIE HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST LOVED CHRISTMAS FILMS OF ALL TIME.  PEOPLE WILL EITHER LOVE THIS MOVIE TO DEATH LIKE ME... OR HATE IT.  THERE'S NO IN-BETWEEN.  BUT I'M SURE THAT YOU WILL LOVE IT.AND JUST REMEMBER................BE CAREFUL OR YOU'LL SHOT YOUR EYE OUT...!CARLOS ORTIZ\n",
      "I'm not a person who likes low-brow humor, nor am I easily amused, so this movie is one helluva an achievement: every time I see it, no matter how many times I see it, it makes me laugh.  Even having grown up in the 80s in New Jersey(rather than the 40s in Indiana), I find it easy to identify with Ralphie's obsession with the BB Gun and his mother-related dilemma (\"You'll shoot your eye out!\").  I have noticed a disturbing trend in the reviews of people who don't like this movie, however.  Generally, they complain about the violence and the profanity.  I just have one question for these people: have you been under a rock the past twenty years?  You want violence and profanity, try Zeena and South Park, respectively (both shows marketed to kids).  In closing, Grinches, I say to you now a) Get a life and b) Ohh, Fudge.\n",
      "family time is best spent watching stuff like this can only help kids see life just a little bit different from how things use to be\n",
      "This is a great film. Its a must see every Christmas. The Blu Ray copy of it is very well done sound and picture quality is amazing.\n",
      "A Christmas Story, along with It's a Wonderful Life, are my two Christmas Classics.  If you have not seen it, and you are not dead yet, check it out.\n",
      "This is a classic funny film. The actors are great & the kids' interactions are really entertaining. It never gets old, as it is staged in the 50's/60's era.\n",
      "Not being a big Christmas person, it's fun to revisit this movie year after year. The \"triple dog dare you\" part is my fav. Well worth it even if you aren't a Christmas person. A must see every year\n",
      "Holiday Classic! Great movie. Shipped and received within 3 days. Very pleased :-) Bought a Christmas story 2, which I didn't even know existed. My kids loved it!\n",
      "This is the best xmas movie I have ever watched. I saw it for the first time when I was 10 and have watched it every year since.\n",
      "A Christmas Story is one of my favorite Christmas movies ever. The first time I saw it was in my 6th grade class, but the teacher shut it off after Ralphie said \"Son of a bitch\". It was a few more years before I saw it completely, and I completely adore it. My sister and I watch it every year on the day before Thanksgiving, and at least two more times at Christmas. I always tune in to at least three viewings of it on TNT's 24 Hours of A Christmas Story. Everyone who wants to see a wonderfully funny, adorable Christmas movie, should watch A Christmas Story. You won't be disappointed.\n",
      "One of a kind comedy encapsulating numerous classic American Christmas traditions - amazingly done without a single foul word (unless you count \"not-a-finga\") or nude scene - amazing!\n",
      "I finally got tired of watching this run all day with commercials, so rented it. Even better without all the interruptions.  One mostly unrelated comment is that I do not know why it seems I have to pay for so many movies on Amazon Prime!!!  It seems everything I want to watch is extra, not included in the unlimited streaming.\n",
      "I am surprised at the number of poor reviews this movie has received. If you want another Homogenized Dizney movie perhaps this is not the film for you.  If, on the other hand, you are in the mood for a witty, well written holiday film then this is for you.  But please don't hold me responsible if you are offended by \"the soft glow of electric sex in the front room window\". :)  I would have to say \"A Christmas Story\" is definitely a favorite of my entire family.  I've seen this movie 3-5 times every holiday season for the past 14 years and never tire of it.  Watch it now.  \"I TRIPLE DOG DARE YOU!\" I have not seen the DVD version of this film but would recommend seeing it on VHS due to the disappointed tone of most DVD reviews I have read.\n",
      "What can I say about it?  I triple dog dare you to watch this great classic!!!\n",
      "Best Christmas movie ever! We w should not have a Christmas without seeing this movie. It starts the season every year!\n",
      "Christmas classic! Absolutely love it have to watch it every year. Couldn't find our DVD this year so we rented it through Prime.\n",
      "Good price, came quickly, the best story told EVER.  I saw it for the first time in 1985 and it gets better and better.\n",
      "Great movie at a great price, with some nice extras. The price was very good also for this Blu-ray release.\n",
      "I don't know of a single person who doesn't love A Christmas Story. Following little Ralphie in his endeavor to get the greatest Christmas gift of all time is a classic that my family must watch at least three times every year. It's just not Christmas until we get to hear \"You'll shoot your eye out\". My boys are finally to the age that they can appreciate the movie, and they want to watch it more than ever.\n",
      "I watched this movie as a child and had to watch it again for christmas. Still one of the best ones out there!!\n",
      "Lots of laughs and the narrative style is great.  My wife and I sit back and just try to guess how much fun the actors had making that film.  Starts our Christmas off right.\n",
      "Love this movie. Very funny with an old fashion sense of humor. Great for the family. Brings back a lot of memories.\n",
      "My four year old twin grandsons really enjoyed it.  After watching it we visited the Welcome Center by us that displayed scenes from the movie.  Loved it!\n",
      "Obviously one of the best Christmas movies of all time!  Our kids now love it and it is part of our Christmas tradition.\n",
      "Of course I love it! Who doesn't love A Christmas Story? We watched it on Christmas day. My parents (in their 70's) had never seen it. Come to find out, my great-grandfather actually did shoot himself in the eye with a BB gun!\n",
      "Reminds me of xmas as a kid when you really wanted something but didnt want to seem like. Love this story.\n",
      "the movie is a classic and the leg lamp lights look great hanging from the fireplace mantel amid the xmas stockings.\n",
      "This is a family favorite. It's a tradition in our family to watch it every Christmas Eve. Christmas wouldn't be the same without it.\n",
      "We watched this for the first time on Christmas Eve.  The movie was cute, but not as memorable as we expected......\n",
      "My husband grew up watching this movie on Christmas day, so I had to purchase it on bluray. It was a great purchase and got a big smile this year. :)\n",
      "Better than the edited for time TV version, a must see every Christmas for the entire family.  Will watch again.\n",
      "My family watches this movie every Christmas on TNT and I have always been scared that one day the network wouldn't show it anymore so I wanted to have the DVD on hand just in case. The shipping was all that I needed it to be and the product was delivered in good shape.\n",
      "This is a fun movie about a boy's wish for Christmas.  It isn't the same old Santa movie, which makes it more fun.\n",
      "This movie is an annual Christmas \"Event\" in my household, second to none.  Of course other annual Christmas movie traditons in our home include the classic \"Charlie Brown Christmas\", and one dear to my heart, \"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer\".  However, those hold mainly nostalgic value for me -- I enjoy them immensely of course -- but none can compete with \"A Christmas Story\" for pure entertainment value!I first saw this as a pre-teen, along with my family.  It was an instant classic for us, and we watched it every year.  I of course continued this tradition into adulthood - introducing it to my husband and then my kids (the younger two don't quite get it yet, but my almost 10 year old loves it!).This movie has all the great nostalgic touches -- the perfect example of a 40's-era midwest American family, complete with many highlights of that golden age (which I admittedly only know through stories of my parents, but they are touching nonetheless).More than the touches of yester-year warmth, however, the absolute hilarity of this Christmas movie is simply unparallelled.  Several holiday movies since then have tried to match its comic value, and none have come close.I love funny movies -- but real, truly laugh-out-loud ones are as rare as a snowstorm in Texas.  This one is the real deal.If you haven't seen it, please -- run, don't walk to your nearest movie rental store and GET IT. The childhood antics and dreams of Ralphie will win your heart forever, and several lines and scenes from the movie will stay with you always.Watching it every single year since the mid-eighties has not diminished my fresh enjoyment of it one iota.\"You'll shoot your eye out kid....HO!! HO!! HO!!\" (for those of you who have seen it, imagine the Santa Mall scene with the boot on the last \"HO\").  That's my personal favorite. : )\n",
      "Everyone just wouldn't want to have this kids day, and never stick your tongue on a frozen pole.  \"Don't shoot your eye out\" is just what every parent would tell their child and of course it would happen to me.  This is a classic we watch every year with our kids.\n",
      "This poignant yet non-saccachrine story is one tradition shared by at least 1/6th of all Americans, which is apparently how many tuned in to see this movie being played 24 hours a day on cable channel TNT last Christmas.It is hard to believe that, like \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" this film didn't automatically hit a home run at the box office, but after twenty years, it's met the test of time, picking up new fans each generation. So many of the actors turn in understated, wry performances, including the children, who don't resort to \"the cutesys\" in order to keep audience interest high, and come off as true to life, rather than \"movie\" kids. While everyone who ever dreamt of a special toy for Christmas can relate to Ralphie, adults will love Ralphie's parents, played by Melinda Dillon and Darren McGann, and to a lesser extent, the teacher. Along with Ralphie's fun fantasies and excitement over his decoder ring, there's magic in small moments - the mother tastes Lifebuoy, the father flipping a forlorn piece of turkey, and of course, the moment when the grownups have their \"battle on Cleveland Street\".  The overall message is one of gruff love and wonder in the face of life's little disappointments.As for the two DVDs and the special features, this is one set that was made primarily for a family audience, and may disappoint more seasoned DVD viewers. One of the disc easter eggs is a tacky and unfunny advertisement for a Leg Lamp as seen in the picture - ironically, considering the Little Orphan Annie/Ovaltine decoder ring incident in this film. The commentary track is in a polite, measured tone by Peter Billingsley (Ralphie) and director Bob Clark, who delicately refers to Jean Shepherd's difficult reputation, mentioning that Steven Spielberg asked him, \"How did you deal with him?\" after meeting Shepherd. Clark also notes that he asked Shepherd to leave the set after a few weeks, but never bad-mouths him, instead reminiscing about the first time he heard Shepherd on the radio, driving to a date in Florida, and deciding at once that he would make a film of Shepherd's stories.Jean Shepherd's original radio monologues are on here, but the interface, shaped like a classic radio, is a little confusing. Using the left/right keys will switch between the two stories on the radio, but using the up key is the only way to exit; my DVD player did not allow me to redirect to the main or sub-menu.While the Double Dog Dare trivia challenge is cute, the featurette, interviewing most of the child actors and Clark, is broken up by several script pages filled with silly rhymes. One of these \"pages\" would have been enough. \"Scut Farkus\" actually steals the show here, upbeat, energetic and mock-hostile, telling the tale of a Christmas bulb he'd prefer to forget. Fortunately, \"Flick\" does not detail some of the poor choices he recently made employment-wise.\n",
      "This is the first Blu-ray movie I've purchased where I really noticed a difference in the quality of the film. There were so many scenes on this Blu-ray edition where the colors really popped. Definitely worth paying a little extra and getting the Blu-ray.\n",
      "I love christmas and nothing is better than snow, presents and spending time with loved ones. But the one thing I anticipate the most is seeing the movie \"A Christmas Story\" on TV, a charming tale of a 9 year old boy named Ralphie, his wacky friends and family, and his quest for the ultimate christmas gift, a red rider bee bee gun. I first saw the movie when I was 13, in a couch bus coming back from New York City in the middle of December. It immediately stole my heart. I loved when TNT ran \"24 hours of A Christmas Story\" on Christmas Eve. Me and my younger cousins continued to watch it on Christmas days as we opened Christmas, trying to uncover the perfect present, just like Ralphie. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves the holidays and who's young at heart. It's a wonderful way to kick off a wonderful holiday.\n",
      "I watched it with my family around the holidays when I was a kid an I have to watch it now with my family..\n",
      "It wouldn't be Christmas without A Christmas Story. I don't have cable so watching it nonstop on TBS isn't an option but I was very happy to be able to stream it through Amazon.\n",
      "From my childhood to now, I'm a HUGE fan. Now, MY kids are enjoying it too. We watch it every year and it never gets old.\n",
      "Don't get me wrong, I thought this was a very cute and funny movie, but I feel like it goes in the category of slightly overrated.  I've had many people recommend this movie and said it was one of the best movies of all time.  While I did think it was good, I wouldn't put it in the category of best of all time.  Definitely worth a watch, but don't set your expectations as high as I did or you might be slightly disappointed.\n",
      "I love this movie.  I also like the books that it is based upon by Jean Shepard.  Truly funny.  The dad is probably my favorite just because of his way with words. HA!  But the classic scene is when Ralphie goes to see Santa : You'll shoot your eye out, kid!  Merry Christmas! HO. HO. HO.A great movie for the whole family!\n",
      "What is Christmas without \"A Christmas Story.\"  I grew up watching this movie every year.  I was so happy to share it with my son.\n",
      "This is a must see holiday classic! Love this movie!!! I already own it, but I purchased it for my dad.  I really appreciate the ability to order on line and have it directly ship to another address.  Thanks!\n",
      "A Christmas classic!! Watching Raphie's quest for the BB gun never gets old - watching on Christmas Eve is a tradition!\n",
      "I purchased this :A Christmas Story [Blu-ray]  I’m very happy with my purchase.  The :A Christmas Story [Blu-ray]  was at a low cost and was shipped to me in a timely manner.  Amazon had the lowest price when I was comparing prices with other vendor suppliers.  I would recommend this :A Christmas Story [Blu-ray]  to all who are in the market to purchase this type of product.\n",
      "This is, by far, the best Christmas movie ever made! If you are looking to get into the Christmas spirit, watch this movie!\n",
      "Simply a classic and brings me back to my childhood.  Traditional holiday favorite for years to come with my own children :)\n",
      "A Christmas Story is a loved movie for me.  Was so happy to get the DVD.  I felt the price was great and shipping time/cost was great too.\n",
      "Family favorite!! We've watched this movie on Christmas Eve since I was a little child. Keeping on the tradition with my children!!\n",
      "I bought this movie cause its an old christmas movie which I love and recomend italso love the actors in this movie\n",
      "ITS A CLEAN CUT MOVIE WITHOUT CUSSING,SEX AND HOMOSEXUALITY. ITS SWEET,FUNNY. ENTERTAINING AND KID FRIENDLY. THE CLOSEST THE MOVIE EVEN COMES REMOTELY CLOSE TO SEXUALITY IS THE LAMP.\n",
      "Great movie; my family enjoyed it. I watch it every year. Love the lamp scene :) especially when she breaks it\n",
      "This was a Christmas gift that I bought for our family to enjoy year after year. And so far we have!\n",
      "I can't even count how many times I've seen this movie. The performances (even the bit ones) are almost all brilliant, and the stories and situations are very relatable.\n",
      "Love this movie. Classic. Always watch on Christmas. Do not have cable anymore so I had to rent it, which was well worth it because it is a classic.\n",
      "Absolutely great movie. Does have some strong language in it though. I would have given it at least a PG-13, not a PG.\n",
      "I love this movie from the 1st time I saw it (over 20 yrs ago). It truley is't the holidays untill you have watch this movie on TV or DVD.Great laughs many viewings later with so many memorable moments. But I don't beleive in spoilers so I won't mention them for the 1 or 2 poor souls out there who have not had the pleasure of enjoying this movie with a hot cup of cocoa.\n",
      "Christmas simply isn't complete without having this on in the background for 24 hours on TBS, unfortunately, I gave up my cable subscription. Now I can play the blu-ray version without any commercials once I figure out how to turn on autoplay. Hmm, I guess we could take turns getting off the couch and restarting it. . . that has to count as exercise.\n",
      "all I have to say is BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!non stop laughs, a tradition to watch this on Thanksgiving with my family for years\n",
      "Enjoyed this movie over and over again.  Seems you never get tired of the funny scenes.  The lamp scene gets my family every time.\n",
      "A Christmas Story is a trip back to Christmas with all its imperfect incidents. Ralfie's family celebrate the season and each other!\n",
      "Its one of the best xmas movies from my childhood and every year I cant wait to c it.great memories from the past present and hopefully for my granddaughter too\n",
      "We watch this classic every year at Christmas time and it's still our favorite.  Kids and adults alike will find the humor of the days before Christmas for a boy named Ralphie.\n",
      "Funniest movie about Christmas ever!  This movie is entertaining and appropriate for all family members.  A keeper for generations to come!\n",
      "we were inspired to watch this movie again after a very long time because we saw the stage version of it.  comparing the two, the stage version was better--actors were better, and it had added dialogue/action that made it funnier.  Still, a cute movie and brings you back to a simpler time when people weren't spoiled and kids still respected their parents.\n",
      "This is a fantastic Christmas DVD!  I have loved this film since it first was produced on a DVD.  But I have enjoyed it even more since it has been reproduced on a blu-ray mode.  I would reco9mmend this dvd to anyone who loves the old fashion memories of Christmas and children growing up!\n",
      "The shipment came in a very timely manner and the packaging was perfect.  These HD DVDs cannot be played on regular or Blu-Ray players, and can only be played on an HD-DVD player.  The Seller was very helpful in trying to solve this problem.\n",
      "It's a Christmas classic and I love to watch it every year. It is so funny and even though I know what's going to happen, it still makes me laugh.\n",
      "This is one of our favorite Christmas movies we watch it with family every Christmas and have done so for over 20 years.\n",
      "My daughter wanted this for \"Christmas In July\".  She was so excited when I told her I would be able to get it within two business days.\n",
      "Takes me back to my childhood...though I grew up in Houston, Texas.  Everyone can relate to this timeless Christmas classic.\n",
      "I love this movie!!  It's one of those films you can watch over and over and still laugh at it.  It's a great film for the entire family since it isn't raunchy or violent.  It's a classic holiday film that isn't too sweet!  It came out just before I was born yet my friends always quoted it growing up.\n",
      "Great movie for all ages. It's still a favorite in our family especially when the holidays are here. If in Cleveland---- visit \"The Christmas Story\" house.\n",
      "I really like when TBS shows this for 24 hours on Christmas Eve/Christmas Day, but having the DVD is better given I can watch this any time of the year (and without commercials).\n",
      "If you have never seen A Christmas Story you must watch it right away. It is one of the best and funniest Christmas movies out there. My family gets together on Thanksgiving and my nephews and I kick off the holiday season every year by watching this movie. This is a must have for anyone's Christmas movie collection.\n",
      "i grew up in this era, grew up in hammond indiana and went to school at edison grade school. mellon collie and an infinate sadness.\n",
      "If you're like me, you've been looking at \"A Christmas Story\" dvds every year and wondering, \"Why no features?\"  Well finally for the 20th anniversary our wish has come true, kind of.If you've never seen this movie before, (considering TNT plays it 24 hours straight every Xmas, I find that hard to believe) this is a true classic.  This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family, kids and adults.  We've all gone through what Ralphie goes through for that perfect present.  Plus there's a lot of heart in this movie.  Even technically though it's a period piece, in a way it's timeless.  But enough about the movie, let's talk extras, one by one.1) Widescreen and fullscreen on the same disc- I honestly don't undertstand this tactic.  If you have widescreen, why would you want the other?2) Commentary by Bob Clark and Peter Billingsley- Very nice, although I think it would have been better with the other 'kids' reminiscing as well.  You can tell everyone had fun making this film, although at the time no one knew of the future it held.  (Side note: On the package Melinda Dillon is listed for the commentary.  Incorrect, she is nowhere to be found on the extras.  Too bad)3) Radio readings ny Jean Shepherd- A nice addition, but some visuals other than a picture of a radio would have been better.4) Documentary- It's great to see some of the other 'kids' today.  Flick, Schwartz, and Scutt Farkas join Bob Clark and Peter Billingsley in talking about making this film.  But at just 17 minutes, I would hardly call it a documentary.  Since they did this featurette, why couldn't they join in the commentary?  They all have good things to say about being in the film.5) Leg Lamp and Red Ryder gun featurettes- Here's where things start to go downhill.  While the piece on the gun was interesting, the lamp was way over the top.  Yes, the leg lamp was funny, but you don't need to treat it like it's the History Channel.6) 'Interactive' Trivia- 'Interactive' is their word, not mine.  They ask you questions, you answer them, with no big payoff.7) Decoder ring- Just a simple match-the-quote-to-the-scene deal, with some corny jokes from the actors thrown in.8) Easter eggs- Just 2, real easy to find and definitely not worth the effort.  It's the kind of egg where you think: That's the best they could come up with?Don't get me wrong, I don't wish to sound all negative.  It's truly a great holiday movie.  I just think the extras could have been better.  With all the junk movies that come out loaded with tons of stuff, it's frustrating to see wonderful films like this one get either nothing or stupid stuff.  We want extras that enhance watching the film, not a bunch of flotsam just so you can call them 'extras'.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite Christmas movies.  One of the reasons that I like it is that it is so funny.  And it is always interesting to watch a movie or read a book that involves a child's point of view.  The whole movie is great, but my two favorite scenes are the scene with the lamp and the bunny costume.  I can understand why Ralph would not want to wear something like that.  And I hate the color Pink!  The scenes between the mother and father are priceless.  I would recommend this film to anyone.  Kids will love it, and it will bring back fun memories for the adults.\n",
      "Soap poisoning.....what can I say, it wouldn't be Christmas without this beloved family tradition. There are so many lines in this movie that we quote regularly, that I can't begin to put them all down here, all I can say is if you have never seen this movie, I'm guessing you have been in another country or on the space station, and you need to drop everything and watch it now, it is heartwarming without being smultzy, and full of laughs, and it may very well become a tradition in your home too!\n",
      "This is a great classic movie, it will always be a classic very funny and very entertaining I would recommend\n",
      "Great quality and a great movie!  A family favorite for years! Don't miss out on this film, you'll treasure it!\n",
      "We always watch A Christmas Story every Christmas Day nin our household. The two disc set offers some fun extras.\n",
      "Shipping time was excellent and product is excellent.\n",
      "We have been watching this movie every year since it came out.  For those of us who were children in the 60s it is nostalgic.  For todays children most of the situations (maybe not the BB gun) are still with us.  I once got a \"Lava Lamp\" as a sales award.\n",
      "THIS IS A MUST HAVE CHRISTMAS MOVIE. THIS IS THE ONE OF THE BEST CHRISTMAS MOVIES. IT IS A CHRISMAS TRADITION FOR ME TO WATCH THIS EVERY X-MASS. I LOVE THE WHOLE MOVIE . THIS WHOLE MOVIE IS FILLED WITH CRAZINESS. I LOVE  RALPHIE AND RANDY. EVERYONE DOES A GREAT JOB. I FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS A KID AND I TELL  YOU RALPHIE REALLY KEEPS THE DRAMA GOING . ESPECIALLY WHEN HE SAYS\"FUDGE\" AND HAS TO KEEP THE BAR OF SOAP IN HISMOUTH. ALSO, THE SCENE WHERE HE HAD TO WEAR THE RABBITT SUIT THAT HIS AUNT CLARA HAD MADE FOR HIM . HE WAS LUCKY HIS DAD LET HIM TAKE IT OFF. I LIKE THIS MOVIE. I WOULD BUY THIS MOVIE IF YOULIKE TO LAUGH BECAUSE YOU DEFINITELY WILL LAUGH WATCHING THIS.\n",
      "This movie is great for the whole family.  Anyone can watch this and laugh the whole movie through!  Make sure to watch this!\n",
      "I watched the movie and found it good entertainment, almost nostalgic as it brought back memories of my youth so many years ago. The surroundings were reminiscent of my old neighborhood. It was good. I need to be honsest and confess I bought the movie because I'm a Red Ryder fan. he was my cowboy hero when i was 12 yrs old, and when I found out from an outside source it was about a Red Ryder pellet gun, I had to see it. I had one of those guns when I grew up. Thanks for your service, and accept my apology for bending your ear.\n",
      "From the first time I saw this classic, I laughed so much my jaw muscles hurt. Every one in the family will get a kick out of this movie, particularly the \"Baby Boomer\" generation that grew up in the 50's and 60's.\n",
      "Ralphie speaks for all those that had to negotiate the complex course of those pre-teen years.  I see myself, as a kid, feeling as Ralphie does, facing similar issues and trying to find my way through a maze.  Years later it all seems innocent and humorous but, at the time, we thought otherwise.  A great movie for any willing to be transported to their youth.\n",
      "We hit a glitch on the order but it was addressed as promptly as I mentioned it, I will definitely do business again. Very Profesional. Thank You.\n",
      "This movie captures everything about about being a child at Christmas in a time when parents were the adults, traditions were important & daydreams were the currency of childhood.  It is fabulous, funny & nostalgic.\n",
      "I LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie. I know they play it all day long on Christmas Eve, but still, when it gets to be a certain time of the year I HAVE to see this movie. Had the VHS but it finally died on me, so I had to get a DVD ASAP and when I saw the other reviews on this set, I knew I had to get it. They were all correct. This set is great with all of the little extras. I am actually wanting to bake cookies this year, just to use those great cookie cutters. All in all, a great set and I am SO glad I bought it.\n",
      "I ordered this DVD directly from Germany. This movie is a must have seen at every christmas in our house. Even though, christmas in Europe differs a little bit from christmas in the states, this movie is just one of the most wonderful christmas movies I know.The Special DVD is just great. I always wondered how Scot Fawcus (??) looks today :-)Anyhow. I wondered which bad word Ralphie might use in the original english version while beating up Scott. You don't even hear them. In the german synchronisation there are loads of them (well he doesn't use the f... word, but the german \"sh..\" which is used quite similar).Merry christmas to the world\n",
      "I advise that anyone who was ever a child.A truly sweet comedy which realistically portrays a real family Christmas. This is not a sappy movie either; you'll be glad to know that, unlike most family movies, it does not  make you puke. This movie has the makings of a classic!\n",
      "Best movie ever and so happy to have it i blue ray! A timeless classic that all generations should watch!\n",
      "I love this movie! As a child, I watched it every Christmas with my brother. This year, I had my oldest son (11) watch it with me & he also enjoyed it very much!\n",
      "It is not Christmas until I have watched this movie. I have been watching this since I was a child and I plan to watch it multiple times every year. Love this movie. I highly recommend!\n",
      "I bought this for my sister as a Christmas gift. She LOVES this movie and only  had it on VHS. Now she can watch it when it isn't November/December and TBS isn't showing it 24/7.\n",
      "The movie \"A Christmas Story\" is a wonderful classic Christmas movie we watch every year.  It's one of our top 5 best Christmas movies, and one of the best ever made.  We bought it so we could watch it at home or on the road!We buy all our movies and CDs from Amazon.com.\n",
      "This is an all time classic favorite, my parents loved it, I love it, and my kids will love it! All I need is a lamp made from a sexy woman legs.\n",
      "It doesn't get much better than this. Traditions and the reality of life rolled into a holiday classic. An eternal favorite!\n",
      "Love this story watch it every year sometimes not at Christmas time, makes a very nice gift for friends and family and easy to order for Amazon.\n",
      "There's not much I can say here that nearly 400 reviewers have already said, but it's not Christmas at my house unless \"A Christmas Story\" is on!  It's one of those special movies that you only feel like watching once a year, and then want to see over and over again!!! (My brother recently bought the DVD, but bless TBS for hatching the idea to have it on 24 hours on Christmas Eve and Day for those that don't own it!) This rendition of Christmastime in the 1940s through the eyes of 9-year-old Ralphie Parker is laugh-out loud funny, from the slightly offbeat Parker clan to Ralphie's wise-acre buddies (\"I triple-dog dare you!\") to that ever-popular phrase \"You'll shoot your eye out\"! \"A Christmas Story\" is not only a holiday favorite around here, but it's on every person in my family's 'Top 5 Favorite Movies' list.  Bottom line: WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!\n",
      "This movie is definitely a classic!  I watch it every year during the holiday season and it never gets old.\n",
      "I buy the cartoons and family movies for the neices and nephews that are growing up in my family.  I find myself as well as the parents, watching along and remembering the good ole days.  It's good to be able to have a site where I can find both old and new movies. Thank you\n",
      "Since boycotting cable tv a couple of years ago, we have truly missed watching the Christmas Story marathon on TBS.  So this year I bought the DVD so we can have our own marathon, along with Christmas Vacation and Elf.  :-)\n",
      "IT MAKES ME SMILE ALL YEAR LONG AND IT IS A TRADITION TO WATCH THE MARATHON ON CHRISTMAS EVE AND CHRISTMAS DAY\n",
      "This is a Christmas classic and a must for any holiday collection. The nostalgia is an awesome feeling. I am glad I purchased it.\n",
      "Fun! Fun! Fun!  It has the flavors of the way Christmas was.  Families stayed home together for the day, and did not have to have more to entertain themselves.\n",
      "my family loves this movie!!!! gave as a  gift I have a deluxe addition! if you don't have a must have movie\n",
      "I can't believe I had never seen this!  But, met one of the actors who had played in it as a child.  Very good movie.\n",
      "Brings back memories of my childhood and how simple life was.  My granddaughter cannot believe little people had.  Also what truly Christmas meant to families.  A family Christmas tradition\n",
      "I love this movie, especially because I have the Christmas spirit!  It makes me so happy!  It 's funny too :)\n",
      "This is my favorite movie ever I've enjoyed this movie for years I was tired of waiting on it to come on television once a year now I. Can enjoy it anytime.\n",
      "Poignant, funny, and a Christmas Classic right up there with \"A Christmas Carol\" and \" It's a Wonderful Life\".The cast is a perfect fit.Loved it. A treasure to be watched every year with family and friends.\n",
      "This movie is an annual classic for our family.  Good clean family entertainment.  Had to buy a new copy for our new son-in-law.\n",
      "Love this movie. It makes you laugh every time you watch it!  I would recommend buying this movie. It is played on TV but you have commercials.\n",
      "This movie is sure to make anyone, even a scrooge, feel good about family, childhood and Christmas. It is full of \"the way childhood use to be\".\n",
      "Top 5 best holiday movie of all time!  The HD quality is good and is approved by the whole family!\n",
      "A Christmas Story is the greatest Holiday film ever made. It stands well and above every other holiday themed film. It's a true American classic in every sense of the word. Young Ralphie Parker wants a Red Ryder BB Gun for Christmas. Everyone tells him that he'll shoot his eye out. Ralphie tries everything he can to get that gun. On Christmas, Ralphie gets his wish. The people that warned him about it were also right. The film has the most believeable family. How many parents were like this?. I know of many. Peter Billingsley gives a wonderful performance as Ralphie that is cemented in stone as a film classic. Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon as his parents are top notch. The film is hysterical and very tender and touching as well. I'd watch this movie all year round!. This isn't just a special holiday film. This movie is just special....period.\n",
      "A Christmas tradition in HD...well worth the rent!  The scene in the Chinese restaurant on Christmas Day is worth the rent.\n",
      "As a fan of the movie, my mom wanted a version of the movie that she could watch again when her recorded VHS copy went.  As her go-to person for movies, I knew I could find it for her on Amazon.  She was SO happy to get it.\n",
      "I bought A Christmas Story, along with Miracle on 34th Street and It's a Wonderful Life, as a Christmas gift.  All three of these movies, in my opinion, are must haves!  You would be surprised at how many people have not seen these classic Christmas movies!  Start a new tradition...watching these classics with the kids year after year.  Enjoy!\n",
      "A Christmas classic and a must at the holidays!  LOVE this movie! I find myself talking about it throughout the year :)\n",
      "A great Christmas movie tradition. A must watch film. It is one of my favorite movies to watch with my family at Christmas gatherings.\n",
      "LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! A great Christmas tradition with the whole family. A must buy for the holiday season for sure!\n",
      "This is one of our favorite Christmas movies. We had it in VHS and when we converted to DVD we purchased this. A great movie and purchase.\n",
      "A little wear and tear with packaging but the dvd works and is awesome. Just what I wanted. Shipped quickly!\n",
      "Excellent - this is our all time favorite movie and so much fun to share with kids and grandkids as to \"life\" in older times.\n",
      "I'm going to have to admit it: I don't really like this movie. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my spouse, and, well...OK, it has its charms. The kid that gets his tongue stuck to the metal pole. The infamous \"leg lamp\". \"You'll put your eye out\". The kid that falls in the snow and (pre-Clapper days, no doubt) can't get up. I can't help myself in spots; I laugh in spite of my firmly-held belief that this is a mindless movie that seems to fall off just before rolling the final credits, as if the writer forgot to put in an ending.But since I'm in the minority in my household (EVERYONE loves it), I'll give it four stars for the leg lamp alone. You've gotta admire the leg lamp.\n",
      "Great movie to watch with family, my sons love it they could really relate to the characters. A christmas classic and a must see.\n",
      "This is a collection of tales as they are recollected by a person thinking back on their childhood one Christmas. It has all the exaggerations with its ups and downs.Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) spots a \"Daisy Brand Red-Ryder BB\" 200-shot Carbine with compass, in the window of a story and fantasizes on how to get it for Christmas.Will he succeed?And if so will he shoot his eye out?I had one of those Davie Crocket hats when I was a kid. There were lots of other items and actions that I could relate to. However my wife likes the watering method used by Melinda Dillon (mother) around the trophy. And she likes the way the mother conserved electricity by turning it off. I could see her snickering through the corner of my eye. I am not sure I should have bought this movie. It may prove fatal to any window plans.The sequel of \"A Christmas Story\" (\"It Runs in the Family\" [1994]) lacks a lot of the originality of this one.It Runs in the Family\n",
      "The movie still had its' grainy, classic image on my HD screen and the sound is top-notch.  Good stuff, I recommend.\n",
      "Great movie---one of my favorites of all time!  It was filmed close to where I live in an era when I grew up.Wonderful family entertainment!\n",
      "Love this movie!!! It is an American classic. I bought it with National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. Great way to spend a winter afternoon.\n",
      "This has been a favorite of our family for a very long time and we have to watch it every Christmas Darren McGavin does a stellar job as the father and Ralphie is so cute and has such a time but it all turns out well.  Fun for the entire family.\n",
      "Great fun for the whole family!  I love this movie!  My granddaughter had never seen it, and she loved it, too.\n",
      "My husband's favorite Christmas movie!!  We watch it each Christmas.  Even tho we have watched it many times before, we still find things we had not seen before.  Ralphie  and his adventures are the best part of the movie!\n",
      "This is a movie classic just like A Christmas Carol! Ralphie is a young boy whose obssession is for a Red Ryder beebee gun with a compass in the stock for christmas. However, everyone seems to oppose his wish, even though he leaves not too subtle hints. After all, he's likely to shoot his eye out! This is christmas from a kid's point of view, with enough humor to leave one laughing. From the Major Award to the Scott Farkas affair, these are the times of childhood the way we used to know it when we were kids, when times-- and the things kids wanted were simpler but no less sought after. Does Ralphie get his beebee gun? Will he have to wear that godawful rabbit suit that he got from his benighted aunt? And thanks to the Bumpass' hounds, Chistmas dinner is smiling at us!\n",
      "I am SO happy with the quality, and the fact that I can watch whenever I want via the cloud.\n",
      "This film is a classic. If you need to read a review in order to decide whether to watch this movie, you're either:1. Very young (that's cool)2. Clueless3. A Morbot (also clueless)4. A nerd?5. strange?Just watch the movie!\n",
      "The single best Christmas movie ever produced.  this is a high quality version that works in the full screen format.  Highly reccomend!!\n",
      "A Superb movie which is timeless with excellent performances by the cast. A must see during the HOLIDAY SEASON for the entire family.\n",
      "This is one of those movies you absolutely must have in your Christmas movie library. I am happy to have this\n",
      "Love this movie!  Watch it every Christmas.  Passed on the regular DVD to friends and enjoyed the Blu Ray version\n",
      "This is one of the best Christmas stories or movies, it was fast and good quality. I would reorder anytime\n",
      "I laughed so hard the first time I saw this movie, I fell out of my chair! The Bumpas' were our neighbors.\n",
      "Has become a standard for our family to watch each Christmas season. It will continue to make us appreciate growing up here in Ohio for ever.\n",
      "Knew this would be a classic the first time I saw it!We sitll love to watch it every Christmas!\n",
      "Coming of age in middle-class, middle America. The trials and tribulations of childhood set, not incidently, in the Christmas season.\n",
      "Can you say \"a trip down Memory Lane\"? I really believe the univeral appeal of this movie is that just about everyone can relate to it in some way or another. This is just about my favorite movie of all-time. It's just not Christmas at my house unless this movie is playing in the background somewhere. And this 2-disc DVD is to die for! The many special features on this DVD are very informative and entertaining, and are very much worth it. This would be a very nice present for anyone who likes the movie. Highly recommended!\n",
      "this was the quickest i have ever received anything thru the mail. i would without a doubt purchase from this person again.\n",
      "my favorite movie of all time, it aint xmas without the christmas story. i watched it over n over again and next year ill watch it 20 more times\n",
      "I love this movie.  It was fun and funny and this is exactly how kid's think.  I laughed my butt off.\n",
      "First time I ever saw this movie, it was like watching myself grow up again.Should be on everyones holiday movie to watch with the family.\n",
      "One of the most enjoyable hoiday movies available.  I've seen it a number of times, and it is always funny and poignant.\n",
      "We screen this every year at holiday time, and for the rest of the year, bits of the dialogue are sprinkled in our conversation. \"It must be Italian!\" \"Oh, fu ... dge.\"\n",
      "As is our yearly custom, we watched \"A Christmas Story\" again but this time decided to download from amazon on our tv.  I was disappointed that this movie was not a PRIME members selection since it isn't exactly a new movie or a blockbuster selection as well.  Thankfully \"Christmas Vacation\" is a PRIME members selection since we loaned out our DVD to friends and ended up downloading it as well from Amazon.  The picture quality on the downloads is generally good & audio quality is quite good as well.  As with most downloads though, occasionally the video would get pixelized & almost come to a complete stop but it would only be for a couple of seconds.  We really liked this movie that over the years has become a classic Christmas movie.  I highly recommend the movie if you haven't seen it.  It's worth the $2.\n",
      "I watch this year with a friend who had never seen it before. She laugh out loud. I really should watch the new release of \"A Christmas Story 2\".\n",
      "A Christmas Story produced and directed by Bob Clark with a feature length of 93 minutes has a classic charm that offers quality entertainment for the entire family.  I have seen the movie so many times, mostly during the holidays, that I wonder if I will ever grow tired of it.The movie takes the viewer back to a simple time in the 40's when things didn't seem to be so quite as complicated as the modern day world.  After all, nine-year old Ralphie Parker, played by Peter Billingsley, only asks for ONE thing for Christmas.  This past Christmas I was presented with a Christmas list from one of my children that contained more than 20 items!!  Ralphie simply wants a Red Ryder BB gun and to him that is the ultimate Christmas gift.  However, he receives opposition from his teacher, mother and even jolly old Santa himself.  They all tell him the same thing . . .\"You'll shoot your eye out!\"Ralphie's adventures win my heart everytime.  His wonderful imagination in the Ovaltine decoding and the way he still appears so innocent after occassional bad words slip out while the soap goes in.The family appears to be a little dysfunctional which gives the viewer a reality perspective when compared to shows like \"Leave it to Beaver\".  Darren McGavin plays Ralphie's dad and his \"Tim the Tool Man\" escapades are all hilarious.This movie gives me a warm fuzzy feeling no matter how many times I watch it and it deserves five stars.\n",
      "Who wouldn't love this funny, comfortable movie.  We've been viewing it elsewhere for years and finally decided it was time to call it our own so we could see it whenever the spirit moved us.  No regrets.\n",
      "I love this movie. Every year there is a 24-hour marathon on the television of this film and my family and I watch it at least ten times. It truly never gets old with us as the characters are authentic and full of good humor. It is hysterically funny at times, especially when the father receives the leg lamp in the mail and pronounces the word stamped on the box \"fragile\" as \"fra-gee-lay; huh, must be Italian\". Ralphie and his family make my family's holiday a lot brighter and we all look forward to watching this movie every year.\n",
      "What a great movie. No wonder it's a Christmas classic. I could watch this over and over, and will, now that I have the DVD!!\n",
      "Over the years this movie has become a tradition in my family.  I love breaking it out every year and watching it over again.  I can relate to ralphie wanting a BB gun for christmas and his mother firmly against it.  Great Film!\n",
      "Along with Bill Murray's SCROOGED - this film MUST be owned and viewed every holiday season! :-) Enjoy and share with all those you love.\n",
      "What a wonderful collectors item, my family loves the Christmas story, and with the addition of a cook book plus apron, well beyond what I expected.\n",
      "\"A Christmas Story\" belongs right up there with \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" \"Miracle on 34th Street\" and \"A Christmas Carol\" (choose your favorite version) in the canon of great, indispensable Christmas movies.  Though set in the 1940s, its story is timeless, taking us back to when we were kids and so desperately wanted that one special gift under the tree on Christmas morning.  The movie brilliantly captures the obsession of young Ralphie and his quest for a Red Ryder BB gun, relaying perfectly the magic and thrill of Christmas through a child's eyes.Intermingled with this are wonderful, hilarious snippets of the absurdities of everyday life, from poor Flick getting his tongue frozen to a flagpost, to the perpetually smoking coal furnace, to Ralphie getting his mouth washed out with soap for saying \"fudge\" (though we all know the word he *really* said), to the family's hapless introduction to \"Chinese turkey.\"But what sets \"A Christmas Story\" apart from most other holiday movies it its honesty.  Instead of preaching to us about \"the true meaning of Christmas\" or making us feel guilty about commercialism, the movie acknowledges what we all know but are often afraid to say -- it's all about the toys!This is one of those rare movies that I can watch again and again.  In fact, Christmas isn't complete without at least one viewing.  This DVD is worthy of anyone's collection; in fact, if you have a VHS version, you've probably worn it out.\n",
      "I have always enjoyed this movie mad this year is no different.  A definate cult classic.  If you haven't seen this I highly recommend.\n",
      "There is a moment in A CHRISTMAS STORY that you don't hear much about in movie reviews, but it's one of the many scenes that demonstrate how funny the film really is. Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) had just uttered the \"F--- word\". Mother (Melinda Dillon) literally does the one thing every mother threatens to do when a child uses such language. Now, she demands to know where Ralphie heard that word. We hear Ralphie's narration explain where he heard it. My own father completely came apart with laughter at that explanation. I had never heard the man laugh so hard in my life. I laughed out loud, too. And every time I see the movie it always gets a laugh out of me and my friends.That's one of the laughs to come out of A CHRISTMAS STORY. For my father, it reminded him of the time when he was just 9 years old. He grew up in Southern California in the 1940's and recognized a lot of the elements depicted in the movie. He owned a Daisy Red Rider air rifle. And yes, his mother uttered the phrase, \"you'll shoot your eye out\". Ralphie and his brother Randy (Ian Patrilla), listen to \"Little Orphan Annie\" on the radio, sponsored by Ovaltine. Ralphie orders and receives a decoder pin. And my father told me all of that was true for him at that time. If I remember correctly, he said the teacher in A CHRISTMAS STORY dressed exactly like his grade-school teachers did. Attention to detail was clearly paid in making this movie.There are other really funny scenes in A CHRISTMAS STORY. The Old Man (Darren McGavin) wins a contest and it's a lamp in the shape of a leg. He puts it right in the front window. Mother tries to be polite. This is all the setup. The payoff is in what happens to the lamp: she accidentally breaks it, and confesses her actual opinion on that lamp. When the old man tries to put it back together, watch her in the background. Another great scene is what happens when Ralphie tries to plead with Santa after his mother and teacher told him the same thing. This is one really terrifying Santa Clause, and what he does to Ralphie is funny and not surprising. And finally, there are the fantasies Ralphie has about defending the family home, getting special recognition after his teacher reads his theme, and what would happen if he was struck blind.A CHRISTMAS STORY got very good reviews in the winter of 1983, and did okay at the box office. After it came out on video it became a big sensation. Then, TNT began doing A CHRISTMAS STORY marathons every Christmas Eve. Like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and A CHRISTMAS CAROL, it has become an annual ritual for families to watch every year. It deserves to be called an American classic today. Peter Billingsley is now in his forties and a highly regarded film producer (he has worked with Vince Vaughn and Jon Favrau for the past ten years.) And yet, nearly thirty years after A CHRISTMAS STORY came out, people talk to him about it. Before he did this movie I knew him as \"Messy Marvin\" in the Hershey chocolate syrup commercials. They were really funny. He didn't really act in anything memorable afterwards, but he demonstrated acting talent in this movie.\n",
      "This is not only the best Christmas movie ever, it's one of the best movies ever! How can anyone hate this movie? Who hasn't spent countless hours trying devise a plan to get the one present you want? Who's mother wasn't always worried about you putting your eye out? Who hasn't heard their father curse a blue streak while fixing a car or something that doesn't want to be fixed? Who hasn't been filled with dread by the neighborhood bully, secretly wishing to beat him to a bloody pulp? Who hasn't seen a kid have to test out the 'tongue on a fronzen pole' theory? This movie has it all. Every time I watch this movie ( too many times to count ) I'm 8 years old again. What other movie can completely take you into the movie like this one? If you haven't seen this movie, see it now! It'll get you right into the Christmas spirit. \"Deck da haws, wi' baws of rory, fa ra ra ra ra, ra ra ra ra.\"\n",
      "Great Christmas movie. My family loves to watch this every year. A true classic that everyone needs to watch at least once.\n",
      "My girlfriend already had this movie(on dvd), but this year....her parents got her a blu-ray player so I decided to get one of her favorite Christmas movies in blu-ray for her.  Good buy.\n",
      "A holiday must have very funny for the whole family keeps you laughing. Always loved this movie glad I can share with my children\n",
      "Haven't gotten it yet but had to  get a newer copy since all we have now is a VHS. He knows it's coming and is tickled pink! He has to watch it every Christmas season.\n",
      "This is a wonderful movie that paints a picture of a far simpler world and Christmas season as it should be. This is my favorite movie. People bustling about on the streets. An alley with bullies. A big Christmas window display of a huge train set. Love it.\n",
      "A Classic Movie! I Have To Watch It Every Year At Christmas And It Never Gets Old. It's A Wonderful Film!\n",
      "I couldn't believe I had never seen this movie before. When I was over at my nieces house for Christmas she and her husband put this movie in for us to whach and I loved it, so I just had to have it!  I know my husband and I will enjoy it again come Christmas this year and many more to come!  I received the movie in good condition and in fine time.\n",
      "With rumors of this being pulled off the 24 hour loop as soon as next year i got this in preparation for next Christmas because it is not Christmas with out this movie!!!\n",
      "My mom really loves this movie; we watch it about twice every holliday season.  It could get boring, and it sometimes does, but if I'm looking for some comedy of manners, this is what I think of first.  Loaded with bizarre situations and colorful dreams of a youth bent on the ultimate Christmas present, A Christmas Story is definately one of the better comedies I've seen.\n",
      "Forget about all those leg lamp chatchkas out there... I want those pink bunny pj's (for adults!)  This is a great, classic Christmas movie... one I wish which had more popular when it first came out, so that there might have been a sequel or two (with those wry, sly Jean Shepherd's scripts, of course!)  This is a nice set for the 20th anniversary.  Definitely add it to your collection!\n",
      "I took a carload of kids to see this movie at our local art theater, and it was sold out!  So instead of shelling out $30 for theater tickets, we scored some chinese and had a movie party at our house, downloading this from Amazon Instant Viewing.  The movie is a classic, and essential for kids to understand what it was like when we were kids.  My kids said I was exactly like \"The Old Man\" in the movie.The HD playback was flawless, and well worth the $2.99.  Amazon saved our day!\n",
      "We make sure that this movie along with \"It's A Wonderful Life\" are watched every Christmas Eve. You have to pay attention to all of the subtleties. You can't best this movie for comedy and Christmas Tradition.\n",
      "Post holiday depression, the syndrome in which we overdose on Christmas cheer only to feel deflated when the tinsel is taken down and the tree is tossed to the curb, was considerably lessened for Cleveland, Ohio residents following yuletide 1982. Santa may have returned to the North Pole, but in the heart of the city, Christmas was extended as Hollywood came to town to make a modestly budgeted comedy titled \"A Christmas Story.\"As exciting as it was to have a movie made in one's own backyard, there was little to suggest this film would attract much attention beyond the city limits. The film's biggest star, Darren McGavin, was a superb actor but not a box-office name.  His star shone brightest on television where he memorably played the hard-boiled private investigator of NBC's 1968-69 series \"The Outsider\" and ghoul hunting newspaper reporter Carl Kolchak of ABC's \"The Night Stalker\" (1974-75). The director, Bob Clark, won admirers for his 1975 holiday themed thriller \"Black Christmas,\" but probably lost most of them after he directed \"Porky's,\" the teenage sex comedy that was a big hit with youthful audiences but widely reviled by almost everyone else.Perhaps because it so superbly applied a modern sensibility to the innocence associated with an earlier era, \"A Christmas Story\" transcended its generic title and its distributor's indifference to become a modern classic following its release to television and home video.  Based on the wryly autobiographical work of humorist Jean Shepherd, \"A Christmas Story\" is set in the radio days of the Forties before television dulled our imaginations. Young Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) hears a commercial for a Red Ryder BB gun and becomes obsessed with receiving one for Christmas.  But whenever he expresses his wish to his mother, father, teacher, playmates, even Santa Claus, he hears the same dream crushing pronouncement: \"You'll shoot your eye out, kid.\"\"A Christmas Story\" succeeds because it's sweet but never cloying.  It's grounded in reality yet avoids the cynicism that film-makers usually favor when attempting to avoid sentimentality.  Despite scenes reminiscent of one of Norman Rockwell's Saturday Evening Post covers, the film never idealizes childhood or Christmas, and yet it positively glows with nostalgia.  The cast, especially McGavin, is superb, and so is the direction.  This film just may have benefitted from Clark's work on \"Porky's.\"  If the characters in that sleazy teen comedy were thoroughly despicable, they may have at least helped Clark reign in Billingsley who may have otherwise overdone the cute aspects of his character.  Instead, the pint-sized protagonist is wholly believable. There hasn't been a Christmas film of this quality since the 1951 Alastair Sim version of \"Scrooge,\" and \"A Christmas Story\" can stand alongside the very best of them.\n",
      "This has definitely become a classic Christmas movie, and is watched yearly in my home. My kids were so into this movie this year, we went out and bought them Red Ryder's! They were excited, but concerned they will shoot their eyes out! Lol. We are using them to teach them about gun safety.\n",
      "We love this movie. It's a must own Christmas movie. The extra disc full of special features is pretty cheesy though so you really only need to buy the movie itself.\n",
      "This movie is a tradition for me. It isn't Christmas without it :) And for my two boys it was their first time seeing it!\n",
      "I've been watching \"A Christmas Story\" since I was a kid (born in 86). It is one of my all time favorites. I love all of the characters.\n",
      "\"A Christmas Story\" is one of my Top 5 Fave Movies of all time...This DVD is a real MUST HAVE! It has some trivia questions to test your knowledge...(I did super)! It's loads of fun to watch any time of the year! Also, some of the original kids (Ralphie)have commentaries in the \"Special Features\". It also shows you where the infamous Major Award Leg Lamps are made! That is super cool...You love this movie, GET THIS DVD!\n",
      "Adapted from humorist Jean Shepherd's hilarious memoir (In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash), A Christmas Story has climbed the ranks of the annual holiday must see films to claim its spot among the hallowed elite. If you've ever tried to lick a frozen telephone pole, or found yourself in a ridiculous outfit on Christmas morning, then A Christmas Story is one comedy that you won't want to miss...The story focuses on one central character - 5th grader Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) and his all-encompassing quest to receive a Daisy Brand Red-Ryder BB rifle for Christmas (you could put an eye out with one of those things, you know?) Thwarting Ralphie at every turn are his mother (Melinda Dillon) and father (Darren McGavin) who seem absolutely oblivious to their young child's aims.Unable to come right out and say what he wants, Ralphie drops subtle hints around the house (such as placing clipped-out magazine ads for the gun in his parents' nightstand reading material). When prodded for his true Christmas wish, Ralphie blurts out that he wants a Daisy Brand Red-Ryder BB gun, but his mother's only reply is, \"You don't want one of those. You'll shoot your eye out!\"A Christmas Story is filled with memorable scenes and highlights that have helped built a cult following around the life of a young boy obsessed with Christmas and surrounding by eccentric family members. When Ralphie's father beams with pride at his ability to win a newspaper contest, his proudly displays his prize in the front window of the family home - his prize being a lamp with a woman's long, stocking-covering leg as its own leg to stand on. Embarrassed, Ralphie's mother \"accidentally\" breaks it, sparking a war of words with her husband. Meanwhile, Ralphie dreams of saving the whole family with his Red-Ryder BB gun, and thus earning their undying gratitude.One of the best sequences in the film involves a family trip to the local department store, where Ralphie and his little brother Randy meet with the store Santa Clause near closing time. Following a long, extended wait to reach the front of the line to see Santa, Ralphie is so brimming with anticipation to tell Santa what he wants that he can't speak. So, Santa convinces Ralphie that he wants a football. But before Santa's helper can push Ralphie down the North Pole slide, Ralphie blurts out his true wish, only to hear Santa's reply, \"You'll shoot your eye out with that, kid!\"One of the best Christmas comedies ever made (few come close to Christmas Vacation), A Christmas Story is a memorable holiday classic that the whole family can enjoy. In much the same way as It's A Wonderful Life, the film has only grown in popularity in the years since its release. The timeless nature of its subject matter lends itself well to annual holiday viewing, and it remains one of the few \"must see\" films of the season...The DVD Report\n",
      "the glow of electric sex from his front window. Period!This is the best Christmas movie of my generation. And many more to come. This movie gets me in the holiday spirit like Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole could never do. I am buying the actual leg lamp to go in my front window, and then I can say its officially Christmas. I also plan to see the original home shot in the movie, located in Ohio.\n",
      "If you've never watched this movie, watch it now. TBS does 24 hours of A Christmas Story from 8pm on the 24th until 8pm on the 25th every year, and despite driving my wife crazy, I watch almost every minute of it. It's A Wonderful Life was a horrible choice and pales in comparison. So give the movie a shot and you'll love it. I triple dog dare you!\n",
      "A wonderful Christmas story that anyone that was a child will love.  Any religion. Any age. This is a classic that I missed.\n",
      "Celebrating Christmas in the late 40's to early 50's. Brings back a lot of memories of those who were kids at this time. Great entertainment for all who watch it. Will be a classic for years to come......\n",
      "As a family, we have watched the 24 hour marathon for the past three years.  I purchased this DVD so that my brother could watch his favorite Christmas movie any time he wanted.Favorite Quotes:Ralphie:  Oh..Fudge!Dad: Frageeelee...it must be Italian.Mom: You'll shoot your eye out.\n",
      "Touching and funny. This film has so much about it that's good. I don't want to ruin anything so I won't tell much about what happens in this film. It's a childs perspective on Christmas. It's funny and poiniant. It takes place in the 1950's. I highly recommend this film as it is so good that it needs to be shared with your family. The boy in this film wants a bee bee gun for Christmas and everyone tells him, \"you'll shoot your eye out\" He struggles to prove that this bee bee gun would be a good present for him to have. Beyond that I should keep to myself as it might ruin the film to know much more than that. It's cute and Hysterical. Fun for the whole family.\n",
      "If you haven't seen the movie, do yourself a favor. It's hard to knock the classic story of a boy and his quest for his Red Ryder air rifle. Is there questionable content? Yes, the movie was made in a different era, and portrays an even older era. All of that aside, it holds up as a classic Christmas film to be enjoyed by most.\n",
      "Watch this every year. Always fun to see again and again.It does help get into xmas spirit and dvd was great price.\n",
      "What's not to like? Altho' we are familiar with two people who hate it. Must have had really bad childhoods or is it too corny for younger generations. Hope not.\n",
      "This is a definite all Christmas story fans! The movie comes in a tin case with cookie cutters to make Christmas cookies!\n",
      "Can't add much more than has already been written in praise of this timeless classic.  I can honestly say ... been there ... done that.It's easy to see why this film didn't hit it's stride until it hit video and the home screen.  It looks like it was made for television and fits comfortably there.  Pure delight to watch.\n",
      "... This is one of the funniest movies you will ever see. If you watch it at Christmas it will seem all the more appropriate. Kids of all ages like it. Guys probably may be more empathetic since after all most of us had a Christmas or birthday were we wanted a BB gun. It is a early 1940s period piece that will appeal very strongly to those that grew up in the 40s or 50s. The author reflects back on the Christmas he wanted an Official Red Ryder BB gun.Scenes of his family life are likely to make us cry with laughter because they strike a cord of truth of our own life experiences. Ever seen a kid get his tongue stuck on a cold object? You or friend beat up by a bully? Father cursing a flaky piece of equipment? Pets eat your Christmas dinner? Someone won a goofy prize but they displayed it like a special award from the President? You get the idea. The DVD is a good transfer and includes trailer, languages, et cetera. Well worth adding to Christmas DVDs along side Christmas Vacation, Scrooged, and Trading Places.\n",
      "This odd little film has become the parallel-universe \"It's A Wonderful Life\" of our time. It brings up memories that many people can identify with - wanting - with all your heart - a toy that will \"shoot your eye out\", facing up to the school bully and then getting punished for being violent rather than being commended for courage, and for those of you up north, sticking your tongue on a frozen pole and getting stuck to it. This actually happened to my brother-in-law as a kid.However, Ralphie, the protagonist in our film, has a completely dysfunctional family. To be specific, he has a completely dysfunctional father. In the narration Ralphie never even calls him \"dad\" - he's just \"the old man\". \"The old man\" cares about nothing more than he cares for the tackiest of lamps that he received as an award that is made out of a mannequin's leg that he displays in a position of prominence in the living room. Ralphie's father is no George Bailey. If he got to see the world as it was if he never existed, no doubt the only noticeable difference would be that the tacky lamp would belong to someone else and Ralphie and his mother would be better off. The narration is wonderful as you see everything from a child's perspective, and if you remember your childhood at all, you can probably remember reasoning things out as Ralphie does. In Ralphie's world adults - including his parents - are the arbitrary givers of reward and punishment who all seem to be in odd and unreasoned alignment. These adults are mazes to be solved, not givers of lessons to be learned. However, as an adult, you'll see the humor in the situations too. Highly recommended.\n",
      "A great classic - could watch it over & over again, especially at Christmas and being from Cleveland loved the view of the old Higbee Department store in downtown Cleveland.\n",
      "A timeless christmas story that never gets old. Have been watching this movie since I was a kid. Loved it then and still love it now especially since I now have it as part of my dvd collection. Just awesome!\n",
      "Watched this with my parents (they had never seen it) and enjoyed it like it was the first time. A true Christmas Classic for the whole family!\n",
      "This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! I think this movie should get more credit because it has a good story,it's very funny,and is a great Christmas movie. If you love this movie as much as I did,then check out its sequel,My Summer Story. It's as good as the first.\n",
      "I enjoyed this movie it always puts a smile on my face,the charcters in this movies makes me think of relatives that i remember in my family.  charming movie!\n",
      "Have bought this for a birthday present for a friend.  Was telling her about it and could not believe she had never seen it.. I know she will love it.\n",
      "I think Christmas Story is more popular than \"Miricle on 34th Street and as great as the James Stuart movie.\n",
      "Who doesn't love this movie.  Especially if you were a kid during that era.  It is warm, funny, and nostalgic.\n",
      "This is a classic Christmas movie I watched when I was a kid, and I just shared it for the first time with my own children. The realism of the Christmas season hides inside!! It makes you laugh and cry; best Christmas movie of all time!\n",
      "The movie itself was every bit as funny as when I first saw it. I DO have an issue as to the condition of the \"Collectors Tin\" when it arrived. It was dented, creased and partially crushed on the bottom when it arrived. The box it was shipped in was in perfect condition, so I can only assume that the damage was done during packing. Like I said, the movie was great but I was very disappointed in the condition it arrived in. The only person who should collect THIS tin, is the garbage man!\n",
      "It's a classic movie for Christmas in blu ray. What else can I say for the review? Arrived quickly and now don't have to wait for the 24 hour marathon to watch!\n",
      "For me there is no Christmas if I do not watch this movie, I bought it for my nephews and they enjoyed it too.\n",
      "It was a gift for my daughter. It's a classic movie she has always enjoyed. Every Christmas we get together and watch all the classics.Good service from this vendor. Excellent price.\n",
      "We are showing this in class today to middle school students the last day before their Christmas vacation. It will keep them focused and entertained.\n",
      "Anyone who knows and loves A Christmas Story will be thrilled with this 2 DVD box set! The movie itself is a classic in the US (though not so in Australia where I live) and will have you laughing all the way through.The Additional Features are pretty good - there's a 20th Anniversary doco with most of the boys (no Randy!) and Bob Clark that's quite good. The trivia is great (a little too easy for die hard fans) but the doco on a company that makes leg lamps is a little disappointing. All in all its a great addition to an awesome film!\n",
      "I LOVE this movie! This year I couldn't wait till Christmas eve to watch.. So glad it came quickly!! Thanks!\n",
      "Love this story. Look forward to it being broadcast every year. This year decided that I would buy it in bluray.\n",
      "Even though this movie seems to appear on TV every year, I wanted to have a copy of this classic movie in my collection.  My local theater group (Theatre III in Acton, MA)is about to produce this show on our stage, and our costumer had never seen the show!!  (Hard to believe, I know!)  I wanted to spread the wealth and give her her own copy for \"reference purposes\".  I know that she'll love this movie as much as I do!\n",
      "I think I know all the dialogue in this movie by now, but it never fails to entertain.  Many of the scenes still have us laughing out loud.\n",
      "Great for kids\n",
      "I became aware of this collection through a cookie web site. Not only do you get one of the best Christmas movies ever made, but for the baker it is a must have! You get a collection of great cookie cutters that match the movie such as the leg lamp, a turkey, the bunny suit but you also get a nice cookbook and matching apron. I would buy again and again! I could not find anyone that was selling talking about these cookie cutters or what size they were. They are about 3 to 5 inch cutters. Just the right size. Wonderful gift for the chef in your family.\n",
      "This movie is so like my own childhood memories.  Including the bar of soap, the neighborhood bullie and getting your tongue frozen to some ice cold metal, the smokey furnace and the \"Klinkers\".The first time I watched I laughed til my sides hurt.The actors are perfect, kids too, the christmas tree lot.  The Santa parade.  When people say, \"those were the days\"  I think they mean the days of this era.\n",
      "Best movie ever if you haven't seen it you should.  You will watch it over and over and never get sick of it.\n",
      "Our all time favorite Christmas movie, so glad we have added it to our Christmas movie collection.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite Christmas movies; I saw it when it came out in the theater in 1983 when I took my son and his friends for his birthday.  I am so happy to have my own copy!  thanks, Carolyn\n",
      "We bought the DVD for our 8-year-old son this year and we all watched it as a family, laughing out loud many times. I'm sure it will become a part of our holiday tradition.\n",
      "Received Christmas Story in good shape DVD case was in good shape and movie worked.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.Thanks\n",
      "GREAT HOLDIAY CLASSIC>> LOVE WATCHING IT EVERY YEAR AND LAUGHING WITH MY HUSBAND AS WE WATCH IT> IT NEVER GETS OLD\n",
      "My favorite movie. When it is on TBS for 24 hours straight, my TV is on for 24 hours. When I wake up super early for Christmas for my little sister it is the first thing on =D\n",
      "Great movie! Classic!  No more needs to be said :)! A true classic especially for the holidays.  \"FRA-GIL-EY\"! That's all I need to say!\n",
      "If you are like me and 24 hours of this great holiday classic on Christmas eve is just not enough. This DVD is for you. For anyone who has not seen this movie buy it! Share it with your friends and kids. The movie is focused around young Ralphie. Him with his desire for a BB gun and his actively wild imagination take you for a great holiday adventure. Every one will have a moment or scene in the movie they believe was written after their lives. Great for all ages and all times of the year not just Christmas. Plus this DVD has wonderful special features.\n",
      "Love this movie! I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas, because this is his ultimate favorite Christmas movie ever since he was a kid.\n",
      "Classic that all will enjoy. We watch it every year and love it. We would not miss it under the glow of our leg lamp!\n",
      "Best movie to celebrate the holidays with your family! Can't get through the end of the year without watching it at least twice!\n",
      "Wow - the HD made this a true joy to watch once again - got this for a guest who had never seen it and we all laughed ourselves silly\n",
      "This is by far the FUNNIEST Christmas movie you will ever watch. Granted, it's funnier if your birthdate ends with a 50-something or 40-something because your family probably looked a little like theirs.\n",
      "Great service. This is a fun Christmas movie that we enjoy watching every year during the Christmas season. Brings back childhood memories!\n",
      "We have to kick off the Christmas season by watching this hilarious and classic movie.  How many people in America don't know \"you'll shoot your eye out?\" It typifies middle class America in 1939 for all generations and it's good clean fun.\n",
      "Who doesnt love this movie. been meaning to buy this for my mom for quite some time. cant wait to purchase more for future gifts.\n",
      "I spent Christmas with my parents and assumed they had the 24 Hours of A Christmas Story, but they no longer had access to that channel. And I didn't bring my DVD with me - total sadness. But - ta-da! We were able to rent it - for 24 hours - perfect! This is a great story to watch every Christmas - a boy, his toy, and a great ending. See ya next year Ralphie!\n",
      "It just wouldn't be Christmas without this movie!  It's tradition!I watched it as a kid and now get to share it with my own child.\n",
      "Best Christmas movie ever. We can't get through the Christmas season without watching this classic movie. It's the best ever.\n",
      "This movie is absolutely hysterical!! Be prepared to revisit many of your own childhood holiday memories as you watch the adventures of this Midwest family during their Christmas season. I was in stitiches throughout the entire movie, but in so many ways I recalled several similar events that took place in my Queens, New York neighborhood as I was growing up there in the 60's. DON'T MISS THIS MOVIE...It is a definite must-have for your Christmas collection. A fun family movie that is loaded (and I mean loaded!) with hysterics.Will definitely leave you in a very jolly mood!Cris Cunningham\n",
      "A Christmas Story has become a Christmas classic. Although set in the mid 20th Century, the kid values and wistful longings/imaginations are timeless.\n",
      "No really! If you haven't seen this movie, you have missed one of the best Christmas movies of all time.  Watch it now!!\n",
      "This movie is a classic and is so funny. A great holiday movie for the whole family. A must see movie!\n",
      "I've been looking for this every year. I love little Ralphie and the Chinese Christmas diner with the waiters singing.\n",
      "This Christmas movie is a classic. I ordered this movie to watch with family for the Christmas holiday. We enjoyed it so much.\n",
      "Bought this for my daughter-in-law, its her favorite Christmas movie. We have a little competition in the family between \"A Christmas Story\" and \"It's a Wonderful Life\" as to which is the best Christmas movie.\n",
      "A Christmas would not be complete without watching this film, and visiting the house itself in Cleveland. IF you have not seen it, you are missing out on a funny, nostalgic movie\n",
      "This is a very good movie, and a oldie. You can enjoy the movie because it is from back in time!!!\n",
      "Always enjoy kicking off the Christmas season with \"A Christmas Story.\"  It brings a laugh and remembrance of simpler times past.  Ralphie's single focus on his Red Ryder BB Gun is so innocent - especially in today's video-obsessed, hyper-consumptive world.\n",
      "Of course, a fantastic movie that is played throughout the holidays in our home. An added bonus here is the tin in which the movie comes, which my wife has cleverly mixed in with the rest of our holiday decorations. Also, the leg lamp lights are great, and always garner comments from friends and family while visiting. Definately a package I would reccommend over the standard movie package.\n",
      "This was our first rental from Amazon. Everything was perfect. The movie, a classic, and the easy setting up for rentals made it a top rated experience.\n",
      "I love this movie. I have watched it many times and have really enjoyed watching it in such good quality.\n",
      "This delightful story, with narration by the late, great humorist-storyteller Jean Shepard, is the perfect family-friendly story for the Christmas season; told with the wisdom of an adult, but seen through the eyes of a young boy of working-class background, this down-to-earth tale of a midwestern boy's quest for the coveted Red Ryder Air Rifle will leave a lasting impression of American life and values in the mid-20th century. Family fun for youngsters of ALL ages !!!And NO, this film will NOT turn your son or daughter into a gun nut !!!\n",
      "Believe it or not, this is one of my favorite comedy Christmas movies I've ever watched. I've seen it at least 10 times within the last two months on DVD, and I'll probably see it again another 20 on TBS today. The movie itself is pretty humorous. It reminds me of when I was a child in elementary and how fun that day was. The acting was so phenomonal to me, because all the parts were played well. My favorite part was when the Ralphie says in a very fast pace that he wasnts a Red Rider BB Gun to the Macy's mall santa, only to get the common response \"You'll shoot your eye out kid...\". Then he kicks Ralphie down the slide. This DVD is very fun to watch. This movie came out in 1983, and it's actually older tha I am. It includes a trailer, comentary, and interviews with the characters. Like I said before, I've seen it many times, and it never gets old at all. If you're reading this review right now today, TBS is playing the movie all day, so you can't miss it.Peace!P.S.- R.I.P. James Brown\n",
      "This Movie Was Just The Trailers it was not The Movie is Awesome and Love it i would give this movies rating  a 10 .\n",
      "Loved the film.  This story was set where I live and it is fun to try to recognize the places mentioned.  Great movie for kids and adults alike.\n",
      "We love to watch this movie with our kids and my parents.  It bridges the generations and is hilarious.  It reminds us of how simple Christmas can be and still so fun.\n",
      "This Is A Great Movie That My Family And I Enjoy Watching Every Year !If you are looking for Good Family Entertainment at Christmas Time , This Is It !\n",
      "I thought this was going to be another mind numbing Christmas movie. The fact that Darren McGavin was in the movie, I felt it might have possibilities. The first year it was shown on TV I avoid seeing it. The second year, I was glad to watch it. It is highly entertaining and funny. Although, I was not around back in the 40's, this movie brings me back to when I was a child and Christmas was a magical time. I highly recommend this movie for the entire family.\n",
      "love the movie, it looks great in blu ray and I would recommend it to everyone...be sure to buy it...\n",
      "I can remember watching this as a kid! Always looked forward to watching it every chritmas season, never gets old!\n",
      "Lots of laughs had by all a must watch at Christmas time or any time of the year.  Enjoy the Show!\n",
      "This is a terrific movie.  Although it is filled with adult humor, the kids and grandkids love it as well!\n",
      "This year we couldn't watch A Christmas Story on ABC so we purchased it through instant video and watched it on our TV! Perfect!\n",
      "Since it's initial release back in 1983 I've seen this film at least a dozen and a half times. And I've loved it each time. With a wonderful somewhat laconic voiceover narrative by author Jean Shepherd (upon whose stories the movie is based) and terrific performances by Darren McGavin, young Peter Billingsley and Melinda Dillon, this is an immensely funny and even touching movie--with well-realized, wildly imaginative scenes (school bullies, getting a kid to eat, the father's love for an outrageously ugly leg-lamp won in a contest). There is something in which to take new delight with every viewing. Instead of the usual sappy, saccharine stuff that gets aired during the Christmas season, here's a movie with zest and bite. This is a film that uses its source material wonderfully well and succeeds in every way. Celebrate the season with glee and take in A Christmas Story.My highest recommendation.\n",
      "I love this Christmas movie its one of my favorites,this is such a great holiday movie for the film that will be watched decades and decades, this is a movie that will always be remembered and for Christmas they will play it over and over because its known has a classic that everyone loves so this is one of these movies that will be remembered forever!!\n",
      "I would generally rather have my teeth pulled than sit through the generally loathsome Christmas movie fare that is available these days.  Only a few movies are exceptions to this, and \"A Christmas Story\" is near the top of that list.It doesn't matter that the story is set in late 1945 --- if you remember your own childhood (or have kids in the right age) you will be able to relate to the trials & tribulations of Ralphie and his peers.  This movie is remarkably free of sappy nostalgia --- thank fortune --- and instead focuses on the ordeals of childhood with all of Shepard's mordant wit wonderfully intact.  The narrative & dialogue is exquisite and always has me laughing, even after repeated viewings.From a historical perspective, I enjoy the fact that this is one of very very few films available today that deals with post-war 1940's USA.  I cannot think of many films (\"Best Years of Our Lives\" --- any others?) that cover that particular time period, which seems to have disappeared from our collective memory for some reason.Really, this is as good as it gets; a reminiscence of childhood without sentiment or nostalgia, and gobs of humor.  It happens to be centered around the Christmas season, so I suppose it has to be classified as a Christmas film, but it really is entertaining to watch at any time of the year.\n",
      "we were looking to watch this, but do not subscribe to cable tv. it streamed well for the most part.\n",
      "This little film is a gem. From the snowy scenes to  Ralphy's antics, A Christmas Story takes us back to a simple time when Santa andChristmas wishes made a child's dreams come true. Loved it!\n",
      "Both of my grown sons adore this film- for them it is a Christmas Tradition to watch it over and over. When one couldn't find his copy, I ordered him one for them to watch together again.\n",
      "I absolutely love this movie!! It is just as funny as I remember. This is going to be a new Christmas Tradition. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Movie is in great condition.  No scratches were on the disc.  Case in good condition also\n",
      "This is a movie to watch over and over as proven around christmas time. My son and nephew REALLY enjoyed and were happy as ever that I got this for them.\n",
      "A fun Christmas movie about getting the gift you really wanted as a child.  I classic everyone needs to see!\n",
      "Of all of the Christmas movies this is my all time favorite especially when Ralphie puts a beat down on the local Bullies and whol can forget the triple dog dare you to put your tongue on a frozen pole\n",
      "\"A Christmas Story\" is by far my family's favorite holiday movie! Our VHS tape wore out and we had to replace it with this DVD. We watch it at least twice during the Christmas season and once or twice in the summer. We also find ourselves quoting some of the classic lines all year round!Based on great book,In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash, this movie captures the mania that built up around Christmas in almost every child in a more innocent age. The sub plots are well conceived and wonderfully woven into the story.HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!\n",
      "I love this movie, i have watched it every christmas since i was about 3.  I have not purchased the DVD but the actual movie is GENUIS!!!  a boy grows up and each year he wants a red rider BB gun.  all the adults tell him, no, you could shoot your eye out! anyways they have very funny scenes in this movie.  I love it!\n",
      "A lighthearted romp through the eyes of a boy from time past in this wonderful country.  Good for the whole family.\n",
      "I think this is one of the best family holiday films. My children and I all love to watch this movie around Christmas.\n",
      "Grandma has been a huge fan of the film since it came out and really enjoyed this gift.  She's looking forward to trying some of the recipes and the kids will love the leg lamp cookies she'll make!\n",
      "This has become a Christmas Classic.  Taking an hour or two out of the hustle and bustle of the Christmas season to watch this movie is well worth it.\n",
      "One of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Great cast, hilarious. It's a holiday tradition at my house. You'll shoot your eye out. :-)\n",
      "Great movie and a new age classic.  Blu-Ray doesn't really add anything to the movie but if its around the same price I'd still recommend it.\n",
      "This is not the true meaning of Christmas, but rather a Holiday tradition to watch this every year.I was so happy to find a copy of this in VHS for a cousin, who still has the old format.Thanks sender for the prompt service and Thanks Amazon for having this type of a web site.\n",
      "This is truly a holiday classic, a must-see movie as a part of our Christmas traditions. We've seen it dozen's of times and it never gets old. A great movie for anyone's collection.\n",
      "I had not seen this story in years.  It is a dilightfully funny Christmas Classic narrated from the perspective of a loveable and beleiveable boy of the 1950s.  A family movie that will be enjoyed by all.\n",
      "This movie makes you feel like the simple Christmas is always the best. How could you not like this holiday movie.  The fact that it was made in the 1980's is amazing. I thought I was watching something from the 40's.. fantastic.  See it!\n",
      "This is a good movie about a boy who wants a BB gun for Christmas. They show it 24 hours a day  on Christmas. They couldve picked a better Christmas movie to do that with in my opinion but its still a good movie. The bonuses are interesting especially Jean Sheppherd reading the radio story about how a childhood friend of his really did stick his tounge to a pole on a dare and then couldnt get it off. This is a really good movie and despite what some reviewers have said you should get it. Merry Christmas.\n",
      "I loved this movie when it first came out and now I have had the chance to watch it again with my own family.  Great scenes and the video transfer seems fine.\n",
      "The acting is good, the story line is good! This is one of the holiday videos that come out numerous times around the holidays. This is a classic and will be for many years to come. Oh yeah, and dont forget to drink your ovaltine!\n",
      "It's just not Christmas without \" A Christmas Story\".  Brings back great memories of growing up and now I can't wait for Christmas to get here again so I can watch it again.\n",
      "the family love it. i love the price, received it in less than a week. i have seen this movie many times, but never have enjoyed it more than on blue ray.\n",
      "This is such a classic Christmas tale that also portrays the period (the'40's) convincingly.  Ralphy is a dynamic leading man with brilliant comic timing\n",
      "Watch this with my  9 year old. The whole family was laughing out loud.  Guess I need to have six more words.\n",
      "We were in the mood for a Christmas movie, but didn't want to see the traditional ones we usually do. This movie was great fun-reminding us of our own childhoods dealing with classmates and family. Also, it reminded us of how we really, really, couldn't wait till Christmas morning, hoping to find the gift of our dreams under the tree.\n",
      "Love this movie! The only difference between this story and my childhood was that I had the Captain Midnight decoder pin. Great movie!\n",
      "I greatly enjoyed the fast service and great pricing. I am very happy to own this timeless classic.\n",
      "Even though it's from the late forties, my childhood, all ages I've encountered still love it. The interaction between all the various family members is so typical yet funny and enjoyable. I also presented my grandson w/a Red Ryder BB Gun this Christmas and I warned him \"Not to shoot your eye out\".\n",
      "One of my favorite movies.  Brings back fond memories of Christmas pasts.  Watching A Christmas Story is a great holiday tradition.\n",
      "Its hard to believe, but there are actually people out there that have never seen this Christmas Classic.  Its the quintessential Christmas Holiday movie and one of our family's favorites, so much so it even inspired us to take a trip to Cleveland to see the REAL Christmas house.\n",
      "This is definitely a holiday classic - we just watched it (again) after any years, and for the first time with our (almost 6 yo) son. He Loved It! And luckily all he wants is a Nerf gun... so I think his eyes are safe for now. :)\n",
      "This is a wonderful movie that my family loves watching every December. Caution, make sure you have an HD DVD player or this DVD will not work.\n",
      "One of the great Christmas classics.  Watching it now with my young kids, I wish there was a bit less profanity (and thus four stars instead of five).  Other than that, what a great movie.  It captures exactly how I thought as a kid, and not just about Christmas and Christmas gifts....\n",
      "Although my dvd has not been shipped yet I watch it every year on television. I can't wait to get it to watch it commercial free. This is just a wonderful light hearted Christmas movie. Hysterically funny and the cast all fit together well.\n",
      "I love that movie, never miss an opportunity to see it again at Christmas. The script is perfect, and the constant humor makes it a delight compared to overly sentimental stories. It is one of the only movies where a child is represented with the mind of a child. The little guy is obsessed with getting a BB-gun for Christmas and nothing else counts. He thinks like a child: he is not made cute for our benefit.Entertaining and heartwarming.\n",
      "This was part 1 of my husband's Christmas present (I also got him the lamp, the beer stein and the soap, decoder, and of course, the LAMP!This DVD has a lot of extras on it we enjoyed watching.  A family tradition\n",
      "Regardless of anyone's childhood, some sort of mishap or touching moment reflected in this movie parallel's one own Christmas story.As a comedy it does not get any better than, \"A Christmas Story\".\n",
      "When this movie first appeared it received very little notice. Probably Melinda Dillon was the closest thing to a star. It quickly became a nostalgic favorite. Every thing fit together so well: The kid trying to convince his parents he needed the Red Ryder rifle to defend them against the bad guys, the bursting with pride father (Darren McGavin in his best role) over luckily (?) winning the table lamp he put in the window so the neighbors could see, the quiet mother who was so ashamed to have anyone see the lamp and who accidentally - of course - broke the lamp, the younger brother who had to take the double dare to touch the frozen light pole with his tongue. Those days are gone forever, but the memories remain.\n",
      "This is one of those movies our family watches every year during the holidays. Great fun and told from a kids perspective.\n",
      "I have watched this movie every year for the past 5 years.  This movie is so funny that my whole family quotes the lines all year long.  I even pop the tape in some times just to get my spirits up.  The movie really is a classic.  The comedy is wonderful.  I would recommend this movie to anyone with kids.  Or just those who have a kids heart.Price is great on DVD.  Got for it.\"Daddy's gonna kill Ralphie..\"The REAL MCCOY\n",
      "I already did this.........and it was in mint condition. It also included the version in French.I have nothing else to add.\n",
      "Sweet, nostalgic movie with many memorable scenes and lines. \"You'll shoot your eye out!\" Midwestern Christmas set in the 1940s, plot centers around a young boy's Christmas wish to get a Red Rider bb gun.\n",
      "A Christmas Story is a classic, rating it five stars does not even do it justice. A must see year after year.\n",
      "My daughter had this on her wish list, she has been watching it on TV for many years, but did not have the DVD, she was really glad to get it. This is a classic story that anyone enjoys.\n",
      "Let's face it.  99% of the people who have seen this movie never saw it in theater.  Their first experience, like mine, was either on video or a TV broadcast just before Christmas.Perhaps whoever put out this DVD wanted some quick money, and therefore avoided the widescreen format.  As for me, I love the fullscreen effect since it adds to the nostalgia of the film.  It reminds me of seeing the movie as a kid for the first time on TV at Christmas time.As for the film itself, this movie is quite easily the best Christmas movie ever made.  The comments that it portrays a dysfuncitional family couldn't be farther from the truth.  Besides telling a funny story, this movie portrays not only how most families are, but how they should be.We have two young brothers who constantly fight the way brothers do, but never in a way to say they hate each other.We have a mother constantly making sure her kids are safe and happy.  Note the scenes where she brings Randy milk when he's crying, or how she diverts attention away from Ralphie after \"the fight.\"As a couple, the parents argue the same way all parents do.  How would your wife react to a giant leg-shaped lamp?!  Sure they argue at times, but aside from sharing every meal together as a family, we see Ralphie's parents at the end of the movie holding each other by Christmas tree light, watching the snow fall at night.Then there's Ralphie's Dad.  Sure he \"works in profanity the way other artists work in oil...,\" but no one can deny the love he shows Ralphie Christmas morning.  Throughout the movie Raphie tries to sell his mother into buying him a BB gun only to find out it was his Father who knew all along.  When the Father is watching his overjoyed child unwrap and prepare his new treasure, I still smile everytime.  In fact, the only travesty about this movie is that the Father didn't receive an Academy Award for Best Actor in this scene.Overall this movie couldn't be better.  In a world filled with politically correct super fuzzy Christmas movies, it's great to sit down and watch a classic Christmas movie.\n",
      "This 1983 film is based on the short stories by Jean Shepherd (who also does the film's narration) and is played for twenty-fours straight on TBS around Christmastime. I've seen the movie probably a half dozen times before I found out that my parents had never seen the movie before. I bought it on DVD  several years ago and made them watch it. My dad didn't care for it, but mom thought it was funny. I think every kid can related to what Ralphie went through just to get that perfect gift that he dreamed of.\n",
      "My boys watch this movie every year. They say it wouldn't feel like Christmas with out seeing this movie year after year. It's a classic! Very funny\n",
      "A Christmas tradition - every year for the 18 years that I've been a high school English teacher, I have shared this movie with my students on the last day of break. It is a wonderful story of the spirit of Christmas - love, giving, tradition, and family. My students and I laugh together throughout, and the final scene leaves them with a warm feeling of family love as I send them off on vacation. A truly special experience for all of us!\n",
      "A gem of a movie...loved it when I first saw it in the theater.  It can be a little over the top at times, but that is what makes it funny, and who could ever forget the lovely lamp or the young boy's desire for a gun for Christmas.\n",
      "This is my all-time FAVORITE Christmas movie!!!  The characters are so much a part of the times, and Ralphie, Schwartz, & Flick are the bestest buddies a kid could wish for!  The narration adds to the movie (that's what makes it so cool!) and the colors are much better than on the VHS version (quite \"dark\").  If you like Christmas movies, this is the one for you!  Also loved the extras on the 2nd DVD and seeing the actors 20 years later - it's still easy to see who is who!  Get it!  It's worth every penny!\n",
      "I had heard about this movie years ago and always dismissed it.  I mean, a kid wanting a BB gun for Christmas?  I just credited the enthusiasts as having very different tastes in Christmas movies.  But, thought I'd  check it out on TCM one year and was truly amazed.  One does need a break from the sentimental and musical ones now and again.As soon as I saw Ralphie's imaginary scene with Mom and Dad and little Randy huddled under the kitchen table, while he, dressed to the cowboy nines, ran off the ruffians, I was hooked.  It's just one funny scene after another, with hilarious sides running through, like Dad and the Bumpus dogs and his bouts with the furnace.  Ah, Mom was a good one, covering for the guys, but strict when it counts!  Yes.  Get the soap!  Of course, she really missed it on old Aunt so-and-so's Christmas gift - big time there.  Dad could be a bit scatty, but boy, did he come through.  And it was the best-wrapped gift, no doubt store done.  A class act there.  But the all-in-all for me was the absolutely side-splitting visit to that unbelievably grinched Santa, not to mention his imps - I mean, elves.  His Ho-Ho-Ho drew convulsive heaves, near tears, along with Ralphie's dazed expression, ending with a boot in the face down the slide.  Oh my gosh - hysterical.  And with all of that, it recalls oh-so-true-to-life common events and has a touching side as well.  Loaded with ho-ho's with absolutely NO ho-hums.  What an amazing child actor!\n",
      "YOU KNOW THE STORY. PROBABLY THE BEST AND MOST TIMELESS CHRISTMAS MOVIE EVER. ALL THE CHARACTERS ARE GEMS,(ESPECIALLY DARRIN McGAVIN AS THE \"OLD MAN\". ONE OF THE CHANNELS WE HAVE SHOWS THIS FOR 24 HOURS STRAIGHT FROM CHRISTMAS EVE THRU CHRISTMAS DAY. TRUE CLASSIC.\n",
      "this has always been one one the greatest christmas movie ...i still enjoy watching it...it always puts a smile on my face and brings back some great memories...i'm quite sure anyone who watches  the movie will like it...i got it so i can watch it anytime i want to.\n",
      "Every home should have their own copy of this classic comedy yet true to life version of how growing up in the forties really was. A feel good movie\n",
      "This is my most favorite movie of all times.  I grew up in Cleveland and Ralphie's day to day life just takes me back so many years.  Public Square, Higbee's, all of the things that I remember so dearly.\n",
      "One of the funniest Christmas movies out there! Ralphie is such a delight and his quirky family all interact so well together. A very well done movie!\n",
      "A Christmas Story is a neo-classic tale, of a young boys quest for a Red Rider BB-gun, that truly rings in the holiday spirit. For me it almost happened the same way, except the gun was a toy called the \"Johnny Seven\", that boasted bullets, grenades, and missile launchers.  Seen through the eyes of Ralphy, the Christmas story details perfectly, a kids eye view of what it is to fantasize, and lobby your parents for your favorite Christmas present.What was so amazing about the movie was how so many of those things happened to my family during one Christmas or another.  Even the ruined dinner, causing them to go to the Chinese restaurant happened. Not by invading dogs, but by an overcooked bird. I think back then, Chinese restaurants were about the only places open on Christmas.Ralphie's adventures at school were typical as well, bullies, toadies, and the faceless mass of victims, were the order of the time. I used to get hit by bullies on the way home with these wooden rulers most school kids carried.  My dad gave me a heavy brass one, that helped me win a few battles, but I was forbidden to take it to school later. You see it fell off my desk a few times, startled the teacher, and most of my classmates.Seeing Santa at the large department store, was always a big deal.  We once waited for hours at the new outdoor mall for a Santa, who was to come in by helicopter.  In the end, he didn't come, and the merchants tried to console us with discount coupons.  The times I made it onto to Santa's lap, I was always convinced I'd get whatever I asked for, even though it didn't always turn out that way.The rest of the family in this movie was just as genuine; every dad has his quirks, and his talents.  Every mom her ways of working the system to come out in her favor, at least most of the time. Behind the scenes, parents do some amazing things on Christmas. While I thought it was Santa at the time, it still amazes me to this day, how my dad built that fancy Lincoln Log Cabin. I was never able to come even close to duplicating it, once I took it apart.One of the main things that keep this movie genuine, is that it's an ordinary family, and a personal Christmas.  Not everyone goes to bother the relatives during the holidays, at least not for an extended visit.  We have a normal, intimate, family ceremony of opening the gifts, and then enjoying the presents.  Like the classic gift scene in this movie, my dad had hidden from sight my \"Johnny Seven\", ultimate toy weapon, and only after I had looked disappointed enough, told me where to look. When this movie played for the first time in the 80's, those great times as a kid, all came back to me with some degree of fondness.As for this particular DVD incarnation.  I love it when they give you both the Wide screen, and Full screen versions.  In the not so distant future we may all be getting HDTV screens, with wide, motion picture, aspect ratio's. Some of the full screen only DVDs I have today, may end up with black bars on sides, (on the new wider TVs) due to how they are produced. If I have a choice, I buy the wide screen, and live with the letterbox.  Its great when the producer gives you both, without charging you like your buying two movies.\n",
      "I watch this movie every year at Christmas time. It's great - funny story that makes me smile every time I see it.\n",
      "WHAT CAN I SAY OTHER THAN IT'S ALMOST AS GOOD AS AN \" official Red Ryder, carbine action, two-hundred shot range model air rifle with a compass in the stock and the thing which tells time!\n",
      "This movie is nostalgic and heart warming. I had never seen the whole thing before, but I've always heard of various parts, such as the tongue-on-frozen-flagpole episode. I took some delight in the part where the bullies harass the little kids until one rises up and fights back. I'm not one for foul language, and this movie politely gives the dad room to fume without making the language explicit. The whole family can watch this one!\n",
      "I watch this movie every Cgristmas. It's a great classic for kids and adults! the classic story that took place like when my parents were little (I think)  of a young elementary boy who wants a red rider BBgun for christmas, but everybody says \"Youll shoot your eye out, youll shoot your eye out!\"\n",
      "we love love love it!!!It is the best of family old time but \"relatable to now \"movies..We have to watch it each year!\n",
      "he loves it. good deal for the price. I don't know what else to write about this.  It's okay is all I have to say.\n",
      "I should be ashamed that this Christmas was the first time I watched this movie. At 25 I should really have seen it before then.HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Anyone that has been to Public Square in Cleveland at Christmas should definitely recognize the scene in the beginning of the movie.  This is such a great movie for so many different reasons..  has a great story line and you have to love the scene at the Chinese Restaurant.  One of my favorite scenes (other than Christmas morning where Ralphie gets what he wanted) is the very end of the movie. You just need to watch it and find out... :)\n",
      "Now I have to stick up for Jamie a bit.  She was honest that she did not like the movie but her family did, and she said you love it or hate it.  I love it.My main problem is these parents writing reviews because it has \"violence and profanity\".  First of all, they were looking for offensive material in this movie; no cussing of any kind was in this movie except for the one time Ralphie says the \"F\" word, which is extended by him into the word fudge in front of his father.  You actually cannot even hear the complete word.  The idea is you know what he said and his mother (which I'm sure some of the mothers with their reviews felt was also wrong) promptly washes out his mouth with soap.  Also, with the mother who felt that this is a bad movie with the gun violence these days, the movie was made in 1983 and guns don't kill people, people kill people.  You can smother someone with a pillow and it doesn't mean it's the pillow's fault.To everyone this is a very cute movie that will make a good portion of you laugh and smile.  Obviously from the other comments the DVD quality is poor but the VHS is just fine.  Not everyone will like this movie, but I hope you do not look at it to raise your children.  That is your job alone to teach your children cussing is bad, guns are not toys, and fighting is wrong, but sometimes you don't have a choice.  That is what this movie was stating.  Ralphie got in a fight because he really had no other choice so he fought to win.  His father yells in the movie and you are to take it as cussing, but you can never understand what he says.  The Santa and the elves seem mean because that is how Ralphie pictures them, as big, mean, scary people.  You have to admit they tend to scare children in real life.  Some parents just need to grow up and realize it's not everyone else's job to raise their children.\n",
      "We always watch this every year. It reminds us of our childhoods and the way Christmas used to be celebrated.\n",
      "Great price and I love that it was available on Blue Ray!So awesome to enjoy it without commercials! Recommend!\n",
      "This is a Holiday Classic.  From the stuck tongue to the BB gun \"You're gonna shoot your eye out\"!  A great tale of growing up too.\n",
      "Ralphie takes me back to Christmas's past.  Wonderful family movie, great for all.  The words, \"You'll shoot your eye out,\" are legend.\n",
      "i ordered this as a gift because it is a great christmas classic and can be watched over and over\n",
      "This movie is a christmas classic in our house. We watch it every year while decorating the christmas tree and putting up lights. Love the dry humor and classic kid behavior.\n",
      "I have been watching this movie around Christmas time for many years now. I thought it was great the first time and have steadily appreciated it more and more each year. Why? Because unlike 99% of the movies that have been made in the past 25 years, it has morals, values and principles that no  longer seem to matter in the \"new improved, get with your own thing society\". Simple, clean, and fun. I can only imagine the sex, violence and profanity that would take place, if this movie was remade now.\n",
      "For years I watched this video (used to own it on VHS) every December, and along with National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation this became a harbinger of Christmas...but I probably hadn't seen it in more than 5 years.  This year I introduced it to my 8-year-old and my 5-year-old.  It holds up pretty well, although there was more swearing in the movie than I remembered.  The kids enjoyed it, and while I was worried it might be a little slow for them they didn't think so.\n",
      "Was excited and relieved to find this on amazon! Made my Christmas! It's nice to know that I can rent whatever movie I am craving for so little!\n",
      "Great picture, still has the original quality picture but it cleaned up really nice.  This is always a great movie, especially around Christmas.\n",
      "This movie is hysterical and can be viewed and enjoyed by the entire family.  We have this played as a family tradition for holidays.\n",
      "It wouldn't be Christmas without  watching this wonderful classic tale. My family looks forward to it every year. Simply the best.\n",
      "This is the funniest christmas movie I've seen. For anyone who has received the worst gift ever, they can relate. For anyone who had a younger sibling and fearless friends. To anticipation of the \"gift\" and  childhood dreams.\n",
      "I started showing this movie to my 4 year old daughter around Thanksgiving time to prepare her for Christmas. I've grown to like the movie and hoped she would too even though it's aged.After Christmas I stopped playing it and didn't think about it. The funny thing is I pulled it out 2 weeks ago as a movie for my daughter to watch for her before bedtime ritual. Since that night she's asked for it about 5 times and says it's her favorite movie. Kids are so wonderful and hard to figure out.\n",
      "This is a funny quirky family movie that will be enjoyed by adults as well as children.  Sure to be a classic.\n",
      "This gift was greatly enjoyed by the reciever. He is a great fan of this movie and must watch it, I swear, at least every other day during the holidays!!The whole idea of the apron and cookie cutters was great!\n",
      "A Christmas Story is the sort of movie you'll love to see again and again. It's not just funny, it's also the sort of quaint re-visitation into America's sentimental past that is a delight. Centering on one boy's Christmas, circa 1947 in small-town Indiana, and his great wish that he receive a Red Ryder BB gun (with which he is solemnly cautioned he will shoot his eye out) there isn't a boring stretch in the entire run-time. There are also too many great scenes in A Christmas Story to begin to list here, and besides, I suspect anyone who reads this review has probably seen the film enough times to know them all by heart. Why wait for Christmas to roll around? Get A Christmas Story on DVD, and put a true gem into your media room collection!\n",
      "There's a bit of nostalgia with this one. I remember liking it more than I actually do, but I loved it then I like it now.\n",
      "This is part of my annual Christmas movie watching, along with six versions of the Christmas Carol.  Never gets old!  Watch it and have lots of laughs!\n",
      "It never fails every Christmas it's on 24 hours but we still had to have the movie.  Just full of good old fashioned laughs.  A lot of the commentary info afterwards was great to hear and learn bits and pieces about the movie.  Guess what we'll be watching 12/25!\n",
      "My kids and I enjoyed it but my wife who never watched it as a kid didn't care for it so much.  She even gave it away as a white elephant gift without my consent.  I'm gonna miss her.  Luckily the recipient was happy to get it because they had misplaced their copy.\n",
      "We watch this movie every year and for me it helps bring in the Christmas spirit.  As an older man and father, it is easy to lose focus on the joy of Christmas and every year this movie does the job.\n",
      "A great and funny Christmas classic.  I always enjoy watching this every year and never get tired of enjoying it.\n",
      "A Christmas Story is about a young boy named Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) and his dream of owning a Red Rider BB gun.  Ralphie decides to ask for his dream prize for Christmas only to hear his mother, teacher, and even Santa Claus give him the typical adult response, \"you'll shoot your eye out\".  The movie focuses on Ralpie's life and his endless scemes to win his coveted prize.  The setting takes place in the early 1940s in a middle class, midwestern small town.  The movie does a wonderful job of telling the story from a child's point of view all the way down to his daydreaming and scemes.  The subplots like the \"Scott Fargus Affair\", and the \"major award\" that Ralpie's father (Darren McGavin) wins in a silly crossword puzzle contest only add to the humor and charm of this holiday classic.  Melinda Dillon plays Ralpie's stay-at-home mother, and Ian Petrella plays Ralphie's irritating baby brother.If you are looking for a funny and charming trip down memory lane then this movie is a  must see.  It will take you back to the innocence of your childhood when you and all of your friends still believed in Santa Claus and the true magic of Christmas.  This movie was written primarily for adult viewers because of the nostalgic feel, but can be enjoyed by people of all ages.  For the past several years, the TNT network has run this movie 24 hours nonstop on Christmas eve and Christmas day.  However, I would strongly suggest buying it and putting right next to the other Christmas classics in your collection.\n",
      "This is hands down my favorite Christmas movie. It has become a tradition in my house to watch it on Christmas Eve. Love it!\n",
      "This is by far the best Christmas movie to watch. No matter how many times my family watches this we never get tired of seeing it again.\n",
      "wonderful movie full od charm and humor --but you already knew that it is shown so often amazed it is actually still available -( needed to add it to my DVD collection - already have it from my VHS days )\n",
      "As many other reviewers have queried:  Why isn't this movie in widescreen format?  And couldn't the producers come up with any extra features?  The DVD itself gets 3 stars, but the movie deserves 5.These gripes notwithstanding, this movie is a modern-day Christmas classic.  It captures the joy and fear and exhilaration and disillusionment of what it was like growing up in an America of a by-gone era.  The late Jean Shepherd is from my parents' generation, but I can still relate completely to Ralphie, Randy and all their friends  -- bullies at school --  Not getting what you really want for Christmas -- having your mouth washed out with soap and fantasizing about the day when they'd all be sorry...  It's all there!Darren McGavin is great as the blustery but sentimental dad and Melinda Dillon as the mom who is wiser than her kids give her credit for.  The movie is touching and hilarious at the same time.  It's so hard being a kid sometimes!This is one of the few movies I can watch over and over again and still laugh.\n",
      "One of the best Christmas classics I've ever seen. I always look at what tv channel airs it for the holidays. Now that I own it I can watch any time I want.\n",
      "I love this movie, and it is indeed in \"high def\" however, its not true HD, its more like Enhanced Def, but it's quality is still good.  For some reason my reciver would only play the audio from the center channel and i couldn't find anywhere on the box that stated it was dolby surround so i think i may have gotten ripped off a little, but i could still \"simulate\" surround sound with my reciever.  It's a definate recommend to buy though.\n",
      "This and A Wonderful Life are our two favorite Christmas movies - one, a bit more through a adults eyes, and the other, through children’s eyes.\n",
      "I'm thrilled that they are giving this DVD version a much needed facelift. Widescreen version, interviews, ect. This is one of my favorite movies.\n",
      "I've heard of this movie for years, but never had opportunity to watch it. We enjoyed it as a family, and it played without any glitches.\n",
      "I had to get this movie FAST for my mother. She would not stop talking about the movie coming up on tv. I then looked it up and AMAZON sent it in less than two days in time for Christmas for a very fair price... I... I should say my mother, was very happy with this purchase.\n",
      "It's the greatest Christmas movie ever made. Everybody knows that. Why bother with any other movie? You'll only be disappointed.\n",
      "This film is one of the best Christmas films for anyone whose always wanted that special something for Christmas.  Ralphie is a boy whose hoping for the ultimate gift-a red ryder bb gun.  The whole month he tries to  persuade his parents to get it for him, while at the same time dealing with  his annoying little brother, avoiding the town bully, and constantly  dreaming of owning the red ryder.  Though this movie has little swearing,  the storyline and screenplay, along with the outrageous humoor make this a  very good movie.  Five stars.\n",
      "No cable, no problem. Couldn't find this movie for rent in the local chains so I rented it from Amazon.com. Best idea ever!\n",
      "Reminds me of my youth. I could watch this story 100 times and still enjoy it. It makes me happy.\n",
      "No Christmas season can be complete without watching this with the whole family, booze not required for full enjoyment, HA!\n",
      "Our family Christmas would not be the same without watching this movie every year..... and now my son and his family will be doing the same.\n",
      "Listen up people  I am from HESSVILLE (HAMMOND) Indiana which is the same place where A Christmas Story takes place.its in the northwest part of indiana about 20 minutes from chicago and right next to Gary.  now i wasnt around in the forties but i do know the area very well since i have lived here all of my life.  and the way the movie is set up, its exactly the same then, than it is now.even the telephone pole where Flick gets his tounge stuck to is in the exact same spot as it is in the movie and you can even see 165th street when the fire department is getting his tongue off.  the school Warren G Harding Elementary is the same, same name, same exact red building.  But there are 2 things That I dont like about the movie and being from the same town in where this movie took place in, i feel that my opinion is valed, so if your not from around here then there are a few things that you should know and next time you watch this movie, keep them in mind.  First, in the movie the narrator calls the town HOHMAN, Indiana, there is no such place as Hohman its really called Hammond,Indiana, Hohman is the the name of the main street in downtown Hammond and Its called Hohman Avenue, now i dont know why Jean Shepard did this And if he wanted to be really specific he would have called the town HESSVILLE which is the part of Hammond this story really takes place in. So the City is Hammond but Hessville is the part of Hammond where this movie is supposed to take place.  Now in the movie Ralphie grew up on the LEFT side of Cleveland Street but in all actuallity he lived on the RIGHT side of Cleveland Street further down by (now known as FLICKS TAP which is a bar on Kennedy Ave. that FLICK himself built) see the movie is about Jean Shepard when he was a little kid but he gave some of the characters different names, and changed te name of the city, except for Flick and a few of his other friends, those are real people.  now i thought the movie was great and everything else was perfect i think that jean shepard was a brilliant man (thats why we just built this recreation center and named it after him) I just wish he would have did the littles things that would, for me, make the movie even better. so IF YOUR ever in the area you should stop by theres alot of history here.  thanks for your time\n",
      "It reminds me of how I grew up! Bob Clark is a geinus. \"You'll Shoot your Eye Out Kid\".\n",
      "LAUGH, CRY, AND MOSTOF THE OTHER EMOTIONS KICK IN SOMETIME DURING THIS ENTERTAINING AND POINTED FILM.HAS A MESSAGE MOST FAMILIES COULD USE.\n",
      "This is a classic.  It brings you back to your childhood days of Christmas.  This is a must have in any DVD collection.\n",
      "This is a very good Christmas movie, but not the best. Not really appropriate for younger audiences. Very secular and materialistic in its message.\n",
      "Hey all!  This 1983 film, which takes place in the 1940's, is great!  It is about a kid named Ralphie who wants a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas, but he is told by his parents, his teacher (whom he does a paper about what he wants for Christmas), and a department store Santa, who KICKS him in the face and knocks him down a slide, \"You'll shoot your eye out!\"!  This movie is also narrated by Jean Shepherd(who wrote a novel which the movie is based on, titled \"In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash), who also does the voice of Ralphie as an old man.  This hilarious movie is a GREAT Christmas classic, and is fun for all ages.  Unfortunately, the DVD isn't so great.  The picture is grainy and looks old, it isn't avaliable in widescreen, and the only special feature is the theatrical trailer.  This does not ruin this great classic, but unless you are interested in adding to your DVD collection, you should save a few dollars and get the VHS.  Thank you for your time, and Merry Christmas!\n",
      "For some reason unknown we had never seen this movie before last night. Well last night we watched it and were totally drawn into its charm. In 1940 I was about the same age as the hero of our story and shared the same longings for a Red Ryder BB Gun. It would be difficult to exaggerate the significance that BB gun had in the life of a boy of that age at that time in history.The movie does a grand job of picturing the life of a boy in that era; the radio programs, the special rings, decoders and other secret devices that were available for the boy who wanted to be a part of something special and most of all the prized BB gun. These things made life worth living for the boy of that time. The serious turn that life would take on December 7th of the next year was still future and unknown; life at this time was good.In the evenings the family would gather around the radio and listen to favorite shows; there were a number of mystery shows that would come on in the evenings and we would always turn off all of the lights in the house and the glow of the dial on the Philco radio would be the only light. Some of the feelings of this mood are caught in the movie.The movie faithfully captures pictures of products that were popular during that time in the kitchen and laundry. The major children's movies of the time, \"Snow White\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\" are portrayed in the Christmas parade scene. Both of these movies were major accomplishments that still have a huge following today.The movie does a good job of placing the viewer in the mind of the young boy in 1940 with his dreams and fantasies about what might be awaiting him in life. This movie is a fairly authentic trip down memory lane for those of us who lived our lives at that time and a glimpse of life from a boy's perspective in 1940 for those who were to be born later.I recommend the movie highly for the entire family; we're adding it to our annual Christmas collection along with other Christmas classics.PS For the record I got my Red Ryder BB gun but can't remember for sure if I slept with it.\n",
      "This is a great Christmas classic. Learned my girlfriend's kid had never seen it. Was great to expose a little one to such a great movie.  Heart warming and hilarious at the same time.Recommend it to anyone!\n",
      "First time any of us had watched this movie all the way through.  We had to stop & replay several scenes a couple of times because we laughed over the lines.It was a hoot!\n",
      "As funny as I remember in the early 1980's, but digitally remastered and restored. The extra disc and the features it contains are a must for any fan. This is one of the funniest and heartwarming Christmas movies ever made!\n",
      "It's become a classic and a must watch during the holidays. It's as funny now many years later as when first released.\n",
      "This is a DVD every family should own.  It was such a wonderful step back in time to a simpler age that those of us who lived it will readily relate too and those who missed this wonderful era can come to know and appreciate it.\n",
      "If you have seen this then you will understand about \"The Lamp\"  It is also going to broadway just gotta love it.If you don't understand about the lamp watch it and you will.  And remember \"oh fudge\"\n",
      "Great scenes shot in Cleveland remind me of home.  Higbees, Public Square and the Terminal Tower.  Funny movie - they made it into a musical on Broadway - can't wait to see that too.\n",
      "This is a Christmas classic that is hilarious and great to watch during the holiday season, or any other occasion, for that matter!\n",
      "Its a christmas classic that ads sugar and spice to your holiday sit back and watch Ralphie and his father, bring the story together\n",
      "This movie is the best Christmas comedy ever. From the beginning to the end, this movie encapsulates the Christmas culture of American youngsters ( well the way it used to be anyway). Every time I watch it I am taken back to the sights, sounds and feelings of what Christmas was like for me as a kid!! Excellent cast too, a classic!!\n",
      "Watching this movie is an annual tradition in our home. It is our favorite. I first saw it years ago and every year since and the Chinese restaurant scene never fails to make me bawl with laughter! Every year after Thanksgiving, we watch it and get ready for the Holidays! It is the most heartwarming movie and very comical. If you haven't seen this one yet....you don't know what you are missing! The characters are perfect and it brings back memories of more wholesome times and how things used to be. An all around excellent movie!\n",
      "But then got stuck watching a marathon with a friend who loved it.  Now it's one of my favorite Christmas movies!\n",
      "This is one of the greatest Christmas movies ever made.  It is funny and nostalgic and so entertaining.  I recommend this for all families.\n",
      "Again very please with my purchase .....price great delivery fast. Wonderful service again!! Thank you\n",
      "A Christmas Story is my #1 favorite Christmas movie. It is 1940s, Ralphie Parker (Billingsley) had a Christmas wish: a Red Ryder 200-shot Carbine Action Air Rifle BB Gun which is very popular to children. His overprotective mom (Dillon), his foul mouthed father (McGavin), and many adults will say the same warning \"you will shoot your eye out\" to him. Ralphie had many hilarious situations to get his wish granted. I love this movie and I promise whenever you want to watch a Christmas film with your family, this film is perfect and a recommend.\n",
      "this item never appeared at our door.  shipper says they dropped it off.  very disappointing.\n",
      "Great bargain!  I've been wanting this for a long time.  Glad I waited!\n",
      "Jean Shepard has always been one of my favorite story tellers. This film is a Christmas Classic for all ages!\n",
      "Great movie for the whole family to enjoy and an interesting window into the lives of people in the late 1950s\n",
      "Our christmas video is one more add to our collection , the family really likes the message it portrays in it.\n",
      "I love this movie.  It's a Christmas time favorite.  Would recommend again and again.  Great movie for young and old alike.\n",
      "My daughter who is crazy about this show watches it over and over so she can watch all she wants now on her on tv with out me\n",
      "This a very funny movie. It is really good and anyone that is looking for a Christmas movie should watch.\n",
      "I love this movie, my kids and grandkids love this movie. It's the comfort food of holiday films. (Okay, okay, sometimes I watch it in Spring and Summer just because it lifts my spirits!)\n",
      "I watched this 3 times during my rental. Absolutely hilarious movie! A classic tale that can be enjoyed by all generations.\n",
      "Grreat christmas story. Saw the musicial play a days ago it was wonderful.  My grandchildren had not seen the movie until now.  And loved it.\n",
      "timeless classic ......You'll shoot your eye out kid......I watch this every year on Christmas eve over and over and over and over again ......It is a must have for the holidays.... if you grew up in the 70's (as I did)....everyone either had a Dad like this or knew someone who did....ITS GREAT!!!\n",
      "The best Christmas tale ever - evident by Ted Turner running it for 24 hours straight the last two Christmases.But don't let that stop you.  To see the real story of the Christmas story you need to see this on DVD and all its Red Rider Beebee gun glory.The cast is superb, the tale one all babyboomers will feel is a lot like their childhood.  It is fond remembrances, without the overly cutsie pie touches.  The kids are real, the emotions are real and funny and the late Jean Sheppard's wit ( and narration) shine in this perfect tale of a boy and his desire for a Red Rider Beebee gun and the lengths he will go to to 'help' Santa remember.I love books, and often when one is made into a movie, I prefer the book.  To Kill a Mockingbird is one that I loved in both book form and movie form, and this is the other.  Based on several of Sheppard's books, this is a true gem.Every family should have this.\n",
      "Very nice gift, If you know the story the movie is cute but the box set comes with leg lamp lights for your tree prob more of a collector's item than anything I really recommend this purchase if you like the movie.\n",
      "Can't pass a year without watching this movie. It reminds me so much when I was a kid myself. It's a classic.\n",
      "The condition and shipping were perfect.  Personally I hate this movie, but my son in law would watch it ten times a day if he could.  He loved it as a gift.\n",
      "Have loved this movie since I first saw it on TBS when I was probably 6 or 7. It's one of those movies  I'll watch anytime  of the year to give me a good laugh & put me in a good mood. Was a great deal through Amazon (only paid under $5). Had to replace the copy I had worn out :)\n",
      "This is a fun movie that brings back both childhood and parental Christmas memories past.  Sit back and remember, laugh and enjoy this one.\n",
      "This is great movie for just silly fun. Good for the whole family. Quality of DVD production is also excellent.\n",
      "I loved this movie from the first time I saw it. It has now become a tradition to watch each Christmas season. No problems with dvd play. Loved the full screen edition.\n",
      "\"A Christmas Story\" is one of those classics that you feel, needs to be watched every Holiday season.  I can remember watching this film a jillion times as a child and now having the opportunity to share the film with my kids.Despite being a low-budget film at that time, what made this film become a classic is that, it's a Christmas story of an American family in the 1940's.  Ralphie is a child who listens to Orphan Annie on the radio, reads comic books and wants a Red Ryder Air Gun for Christmas.But of course, how can he convince his parents to buy him one when his mother thinks he'll shoot his eye out.  So, you get to see how Ralphie tries to get the gun by trying to get a good grade on his school report, to planting an ad in his mother's favorite magazine and even going to the mall and talking to Santa.But the magical part of this film are its characters.  Every character from Ralphie's family to his friends, everything comes together quite well.  From his father who wins an award which is a leg (in fishnet stockings) lamp, his friends being bullied by Scotty Farkus, his brother who is overly dressed in his snowsuit, his friend sticking his tongue on a pole to see if it would get stuck and much more.So, back in 2003, this film received a 20th Anniversary DVD treatment and in 2006, was followed up by its first Blu-ray release.  Then sure enough, with the 25th Anniversary Ultimate Edition which had a special bundled edition in which people could own a miniature version of the leg lamp (ala string leg lamp lights for the Christmas tree) and the film on Blu-ray or get a version without the lamps.There is no difference with the 2008 Blu-ray version versus the 2006 version.VIDEO:The video is featured in 1080p High Definition/169, 1:85:1.  The Blu-ray is marginally better than the DVD version.  But you can notice the quality of it's clearness via Blu-ray.  You'll have parts on the film which look soft and nicks and scratches from the film.  But I compared my old VHS version to the Blu-ray and oh my, the Blu-ray is light years ahead of it in quality.  For an older film, having been remastered already, I don't really think we are going to get anything better than what we have on Blu-ray.  But it still looks good.AUDIO:The audio is Dolby Digital 1.0 in English and French.  I doubt we will see a TrueHD for this and since it's mostly dialogue and because of its time setting and how old this film is, I suppose I'm not too bothered by this.  It's one of those films that I'm not begging for surround sound.  So, I'm actually OK with it being 1.0.SPECIAL FEATURES:I've owned the first DVD version which had nothing in terms of special features, I didn't own the 20th Anniversary but as for this Blu-ray it includes:* Commentary by Peter Billingsley and Director/Co-Writer Bob Clark - This commentary was actually quite fun to listen to.  You get a lot of Billingsley asking questions to Bob Clark about certain scenes, working with different individuals and also talking about the film and its reception from viewers in the last 20 years.  His relationship with working with Jean Shepard and much more.  There are some times where they are watching the film and don't say anything but I think both were pretty much rewatching the film for its entirety probably in a long time.  One scene I wondered about was the parade which featured Mickey Mouse.  I always wondered how Mickey could show up on an MGM film and sure enough Clark explains how Disney allowed it.* 20th Anniversary Documentary \"Another Christmas Story\" - This documentary features Bob Clark, Peter Billingsley and the guys who play his two buddies and the guy who plays Farkus.  Each talking about their experiences, the pole and tongue scene and how people react to them to this day and how people have memorized the lines.  And learning how a lot of detergent was used to re-create some of those snow scenes.* Daisy Red Ryder - This was an interesting featurette on the actual Daisy Red Ryder Air Rifle.  How it was created for the film and the actual company who produces air guns.* Get a Leg Up - This one is a infomercial like featurette of the leg lamp.  Nothing major.* Script Pages - This features the script of actual scenes that were cut.  Clark talks about several scenes that they didn't use in the film.  I wish they still had that and offered the videos as a deleted scene (especially the Ralphie/Flash Gordon scenes) but you can read the script of what was cut.* Trailer - And looking at the trailer, it looks so old in terms of picture quality after watching it on Blu-ray.For me, \"A CHRISTMAS STORY\" is like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and even \"Home Alone\".  Films that are Christmas classics that you just want to watch with the family during the holidays.\"A CHRISTMAS STORY\" has been a part of so many families holiday's within the last 20 years and remains one of the classics next to \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Charlie Brown Christmas\" (and other classics) shown every year and watched by many.  It's a true-to-heart tale and the way it's written, it's not fluffy, it's the life of a young boy who wants a Christmas present but his parents are not exactly \"Brady Bunch\", magical parents.  Blue collar father with a temper, mother who does her best to take care of the kids and a time in the 1940's of decoder rings and Ovaltine.If you own the 20th Anniversary DVD, really...you don't need to buy this.  But if you are like me and you own the first DVD version with no special features or the VHS version, then yeah, moving up to Blu-ray is a great decision.  It's marginally better in picture quality than the DVD and you get all the special features as well.Overall, it's a Christmas classic worth owning.\n",
      "I grew up  in the era this film is set. Ralphie could have been me, and Darren Mc Gavin, he Father, could have been mine. He was a Ford man, and would defend his choice of car like Mc Gavin loved his Oldsmobile's.  His salty language was used around the house, much to my mothers' distressed and when I let one epitaph lose, I was given the lifebuoy soap treatment. And she wondered where I had heard it?  My mom didn't want me to get a Red Ryder BB gun, and used the same dialog \"you'll shoot your eye out\".  I had a younger brother who wouldn't eat his vegetables, and would stick them anywhere except his mouth.  My Dad was an expert at fixing things, and somehow thought swearing helped. One of my  friends actually was talked into sticky his tongue on a pole in winter. Our Christmas tree had those 7 watt bulbs that could burn down a tree if the extension plug didn't burst into a \"blue ozone\" before. The film is set in a northern city like where I grew up.  We would go to downtown and look into the Christmas displays. It was one of our rituals that have been lost. And since most of us did not get toys, except for Christmas, it was more special than today. Like most grandparents of my generation, we have spoiled them, and Christmas just isn't like it was in my time as a child.\n",
      "Classic Christmas comedy, my kids asked if it was really that funny when we were growing up. And it was.\n",
      "This is an excellent film.  The storyline and the acting is superb.  I recommend this movie to anyone who likes nostalgic Christmas-time stories.\n",
      "Still brings me a smile every time I watch it. YOU'LL SHOOT YOU EYE KID! I am 28 I still watch the marathon every year TNT TBS or whatever channel it show I stay turned until the last show is aired...\n",
      "Ralphie and Randy bring back the Christmas memories I had as a child even though they were a decade behind me.  Getting exactly what you want, but thinking that it wasn't going to happen.\n",
      "This is the absolute best Christmas movie.  The characters are great.  You can't help but laugh, especially if you were brought up during this time frame.\n",
      "A timeless Classic directed to survive the ages.  Taps into every little boys desire for a Red Rider BB gun.\n",
      "Since I doubt anyone on the planet needs a review of the movie, I'll just give a quick review of the Blu-ray disk. Basically, it looks almost the same as the DVD, which is pretty good for an older movie. If you already own any of the DVD versions, there is little need to upgrade to the Blu-ray version. If don't have own a copy, them the Blu-ray version should be in your collection if you're a fan of the movie. There's also an \"Ultimate Collectors Edition\" just released, but it doesn't include any new scenes or extras on the disk. It includes a metal tin, some other goodies, and costs about $15 more. The movie gets 5 stars for being a Christmas classic. The Blu-ray disk get 4 stars for being nothing special.\n",
      "Love this movie. Bought it as a gift for my grandson. He received it in good viewing shape, and loved watching it now as much as he did when he was little\n",
      "It is a marvelous movie for children, but it is also a film that adults can enjoy and \"remember when.\"  It also allows a look at a time in American history that eveyone thinks of as the good old days. Love the narrative aspect of the film as well.\n",
      "Everyone has to own this DVD in their collection.  Even tho it runs non-stop from Christmas Eve to Christmas day, it is still worth having, and half of what it sells for in the stores during the Holiday\n",
      "I've watched this movie for so many years, it's a great movie. I brought my kids up on this movie we all used to watch it together. My son use to imitate the boy in the movie eating mashed potatoes just with his face,when my son was younger of course.I lost my son in the year 2009 so I haven't watched it since then because it reminds me of my son and my daughter and all of us sitting around watching a movie.I'm going to try and watch this movie again because I really do love the movie.\n",
      "This Christmas classic is something our family has watched for years.  If you've never seen it, I highly recommend you get a copy.  It's just good clean family fun, sometimes hard to find that on TV.\n",
      "Timeless movie.  One classic everyone must see at christmas at least one time a year. There's not much more to say.\n",
      "Funny, Heartwarming, and a bit  mischievous.  A must see. Reminded me of my years growing up.  The good ole days.\n",
      "This is the best christmas movie since other christmas movies. Hey Ralphie Want a gun for christmas LOL!!!!! I felt bad for Darren McGavin has passed away last spring because it made me think of him every year in Christmas story movie. This is a classic that everyone should see!!!\n",
      "Wanted my grand children to see this movie.  I saw it when I was a little girl, great movie, did not remember a lot of what happened.\n",
      "I've owned the previous barebones single disc DVD as well as the pretty impressive 2-disc widescreen version. So this purchase was a no brainer for me. There is always a question of improvement in picture/sound quality when upgrading from standard def to high def, particularly with a film over 20 years old. I'll just get it out of the way right off the top. The 1080p video is just beautiful. Is this as good a transfer as \"Batman Begins?\" Well, d'uh! NO. Is it better than the previous DVDs of \"A Christmas Story?\" Heck, yeah! Detail is rich and there is hardly any compression artifacts or video noise whatsoever. One could almost count the individual fibres of the fur on Santa's suit. Film grain is present, but it should be since this is, um, a film. I did detect what appeared to be mosquito noise in the moonlight reflected on Ralphie's face as he happily falls asleep on Christmas night, but that's the only nit I can find to pick at. But all in all this is a pretty great video transfer.The Dolby Digital Plus 1.0 mono track is fine, I guess. I really can't comment too much, being more of a videophile than an audiophile. But I'm sure it's a sonic improvement over the pedestrian Dolby Digital track from the standard def packages...Warner Bros has ported over all the supplementals from the previous 2 disc version - even the two easter eggs, allbeit not hidden on this version but as part of the special features lineup. The supplementals were just fine on the last DVD and they fit in nicely here. Of special note, the supplementals are presented in 480p widescreen, taking full advantage of your widescreen tv's full 16:9 frame. This is a good thing.~RANT~ WB and other studios used to present the special features of their DVDs in full 16:9 anamorphic glory, but have stopped this practice on their more recent home video offerings. Even if the feature was filmed in widescreen - a logical candidate for 16:9 treatment, no? - they are now too often reformatted to 4:3. Some of WBs HD-DVDs port over these unenhanced widescreen features which will be displayed on HDTVs STILL unenhanced...! Makes me crazy! WB and all other studios - I'm not asking for full 1080p, but please fill my screen. It's asinine to present a widescreen image in 4:3 letterbox! Oy... ~END OF RANT~All that to say this: The supplementals on \"A Christmas Story\" remain untouched and fill my 16:9 screen. And I'm happy.In summation, this is a fine HD-DVD package and it should bring much joy  to you for years to come. If you're on the fence, do yourself a favor and buy this HD-DVD. Enthusiastically recommended.\n",
      "You'll wish you could try to shoot your eye out with a Red Ryder BB gun. This movie is funny, quirky, and warm like hot chocolate. It's a Christmas classic!\n",
      "A family favorite for years and years.  It wouldn't be Christmas without it.  This copy was a gift for friends.\n",
      "This has always been a Christmas tradition movie to watch for our family.  I wanted it on DVD so it could be watched whenever we wanted to watch it.\n",
      "I've always enjoyed this movie each Christmas.  I decided to purchase so I could watch it at any time for a good laugh.\n",
      "\"A Christmas Story\" is a warm holiday movie filled with memorable moments and genuinely funny circumstances set in a time that has ceased to exist in America. It's a simple child's tale of the all-American Christmas, capturing a picture-perfect portrait of holiday warmth and zest through its delectable combination of laughter and touching moments. Most importantly, the film recalls the pleasures of childhood during the Christmas season, and that can provide as much joy as any other film.The story is based on a segment of Jean Sheperd's novel \"In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash,\" a personal memoir of his experiences. It helps that Sheperd collaborated in the creation of the screenplay, as well as lending his narration as the adult voice of Ralphie Parker (played by Peter Billingsley), who wants nothing more than to wake up on Christmas morning and find a \"genuine Red Ryder 200-Shot Carbine Action Air Rifle\" under the tree. Ralphie doesn't merely want this gift, but yearns for it with every fiber of his childhood being. His convictions that an English paper on what he wants for Christmas, as well as putting in his request to Santa Claus, stand as his assurance that he cannot fail in his quest.Of course, there are obstacles, made whimsical and witty by director Bob Clark's wonderful knack for situational humor. His mother's words, \"You'll shoot your eye out,\" seem to echo from the mouths of everyone around, including his would-be alibi, Santa Claus, who is seen in a most frightening light by the children who line up to sit on his lap. Even Ms. Shields, his teacher, is a dead end, granting him a C+ on his \"All I Want For Christmas\" theme paper with a small note toting Mrs. Parker's infamous warning.The film is a very warm and inviting Christmas story, capturing the holiday season of yesteryear in an authentic and gleeful manner. Set in Indiana in the 1940's, Clark captures small vignettes of the time period through Ralphie's life experiences, from his eager anticipation of a secret decoder machine sent by the radio show he listens to every night at 6:45, to his punishment for using foul language by keeping a bar of Lifebuoy soap in his mouth for a prolonged period of time (\"Over the years, I got to be quite a connoisseur pf soap...\").What helps the movie in the long run are its characters, who never overstay their welcome or lose the appeal they possess. Ralphie's parents, known only to us as Mom and the Old Man, are the perfect parents: his mother, played with supreme charm by Melinda Dillon, is a warm and caring woman, as shown in her methods of getting younger brother Randy to eat by referring to him as \"Mommy's little piggy,\" and in her protective yet nurturing nature in regards to her children. His father, a stern yet gentle man, is the ideal working-class family man who sits at the table, reads his paper, but still exudes a great deal of caring for his family. Darren McGavin's performance as Mr. Parker deserves high praise, especially in his childlike glee over winning a table lamp in the shape of a woman's leg.Billingsley is the most notable of these actors, instilling Ralphie with all the emotions and thoughts a normal child experiences. His run-ins with neighborhood bully Scut Farcus provides a truly satisfying scene of turning the tables, while his daydreams of getting an A+ on his English paper and his going blind from \"soap poisoning\" are filled wit merriment and humor.I think what \"A Christmas Story\" captures most effectively is the unbearable countdown to Christmas Day, which, for a child, can be the most excruciating twenty-four days of the year. Here is a movie that is guaranteed to bring back wonderful memories of childhood, with something that everyone from all generations can relate to, whether it be the joys of the long-awaited Christmas morning, or the shared pleasure of reliving the time and place, and the painstaking accuracy with which it is portrayed.\n",
      "It's kind of a classic. A classic on Blue-Ray. I don't know what else you need to know... it's awesome.\n",
      "A great Christmas classic that never gets old. New generations of people will see this for all times and I certainly have.\n",
      "Just like the teacher grading his theme in Ralphie's dream, I gladly give this movie an A++++++++++++++++.  Daddy's gonna kill Ralphie.\n"

      "This NEVER ages into a ho-hum movie.  It will still be entertaining 'newcomers' seventy-five years from now.Donald Frederick Curie\n",
      "\"A Christmas Story\" takes me back to when I was a young boy.  We walked to Central Grade School in several feet of snow in the winter.  There were no school busses to keep us warm and toasty.  Mom packed my lunch and I carried it to school in a tin Superman lunch box, or a brown paper bag from the Kroger store on the corner of the block.  A Christmas gift of a Daisy air rifle was a boy's passage to becoming a responsible young man.  We didn't shoot at one another or damage anybody's property because we knew when we went home that evening the \"Old Man\" would find out from a neighbor.  Then I would certainly get a spanking and would loose my privilege of playing with my shiny new Daisy air rifle.  This time in Americana was the best time for children to learn and live the values which produced the \"Greatest Generation\" who built the American dream.  The neighborhoods were safe for children to play outside and have snowball battles and sled ride down \"Suicide Hill.\"  The modern world with both parents working and children being housed in daycare, or raised by a village, has created a tear in the fabric of the family.  I really feel sorry for the children of today because they have not lived \"A Christmas Story.\"  That's such a shame....Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.Kind regards,Don_\n",
      "This movie is great it reminds me when I was young, Ralphie’s age, and I wanted a Red Ryder BB gun.\n",
      "I enjoy watching this classic Christmas movie every year during the holidays. It always makes me laugh. I  read about the history of it, which makes the movie more enjoyable.\n",
      "What can you say about this classic that hasn't already been said? Kids and adults alike watch this and for adults the trip down memory lane can be just as fun as the movie!!! The kids love watching the\"underdog\" win against the bully; as well as the interaction between the parents and kids.A wonderful movie. A must see if you haven't, and a great movie to add to the holiday movie-thon!!!\n",
      "Great movie.  I watch it any time that it is showing on TV at Christmas time.  Now, I can watch it anytime, all year round!\n",
      "I wanted to give this to a friend of mine for her birthday gift. She was surprised when I found it on DVD. With older movies they aren't on DVD's yet. Was happy to be able to purchase it and have it in time for her party.Thanksd\n",
      "my daughter loves this movie-this is one of her all time christmas movies. that lamp is so weird.though;the pole yikes\n",
      "We as a family loved this movie.  It came in very little time and we were able to watch it before Christmas.\n",
      "This is a great movie to watch with your family around the Holidays. It will bring back some of your own childhood memories.  Don't miss it !!\n",
      "I saw it years ago when it first came out and enjoyed it again on Blu-ray,I will watch it every Christmas.\n",
      "I love this movie. I have it on tape but the DVD is better. Everything in this movie is the same as when I grew up during that era. It brings back Christmas memories. The cast is excellent and the story is delightful.\n",
      "It's a classic and I have loved it for years.  Recently I found a friend who had never seen it and I realized I only had an old VHS version.  So I updated to Blu Ray, took it to their house for Christmas and introduced them to a classic.  Definitely something to pass on to others.\n",
      "So often Hollywood tends to treat Christmas with such idealism that the holiday movies all begin to look the same. That's why \"A Christmas Story\" stands out so wonderfully. Life is imperfect in Ralphie's (Peter Billingsley) home - which makes him just like the rest of us. His mom is a nag, his dad uses foul language (beautifully gibberished by Darrin McGavin) and his little brother whines and won't eat his dinner. Meanwhile, Ralphie just wants the one thing for Christmas that no one else seems to want him to have - a Red Ryder B-B gun (because \"he'll shoot his eye out...). \"A Chirstmas Story\" is fun throughout, and the characters are people we know and people we just might be. For kids, it's a snapshot into the lives their parents might have lived. And for parents, it's a look back at a simpler time when misbehaving in school meant daring someone to stick their tongue to the flagpole. This is one movie which is a standard in my household and is definitely worth adding to your Christmas movie collection.\n",
      "This movie is so typical of the times.  I am sure there are many that identify with this Holiday movie.\n",
      "I have grown up with this film, along with Willy Wonka and Home Alone.  And when I watch it today, it takes me back to my childhood days.This isn't top-notch DVD quality, but still better than TNT's, despite digital DVD technology.About the movie: some of the same sound effects and accompanied songs are heard at least twice in this film.  If you listen closely, you'll notice the repetition.  And as for the language, FYI, the old man says \"cripes\" every time (thank goodness).  Of course, who can forget the undecipherable phrases he blurts out  when he attacks the furnace, hehe.  Listen more closely and you can also discover some dub-overs made throughout the film.  Aside from the \"B\" word used a couple times, this film isn't too bad languagewise, but lots of phrases sound like garbled recordings.  (Example: the old man said \"Not A Finger!\" because he didn't want the mother to lay her hands on his broken, plastic lamp.)I should be ashamed to say this, but when I was a kid, the Santa portrayed in this movie used to get me excited for Christmas Eve when he would go down the chimney and deliver presents.  Now, I realize that's not what Christmas is about.  It's about celebrating the joy of our Lord, and loving one another.\n",
      "Watching this movie on Blu ray is just a fantastic experience. The detail is much better than what I watched on TV every year. If you like this movie get it on blu ray.\n",
      "We watch this every year on Christmas.  We used to watch the 24 hour marathons on cable, but no more, now that we finally have the DVD.  I seriously considered buying it last year, but I never got around to it, and I am glad I waited.  This offering is far superior than the previous release!I love this movie because it refuses to take the fun out of Christmas by being sappy.  Sappy Christmas movies are far too common, and they are just depressing.  This is a stitch a minute, and I place it at the top of my list of movies to watch each year.  I recommend that you make this part of your Christmas tradition as well, if you haven't already.\n",
      "We never get tired of watching this movie. It brings back many of our favorite childhood memories. Not just the visual cars and clothing but the old family interactions. The lead character could easily have been my brother John. Thanks for the memories!!! Dottie from Staten Island.\n",
      "I got rid of cable this year, so I didn't have access to 24 hours of a Christmas Story this year!  I was very depressed.  Being able to rent it this year on Amazon saved the day!  My son now has a new favorite Christmas movie and I look forward to being able to watch it with him every year!\n",
      "HOWEVER-RALPHIE'S GOAL:A RED RYDER LEVER ACTION B.B. GUN, IS SOMEWHAT MORE LOFTY!IN A NUTSHELL:RALPHIE IS A BOY ON A MISSION -- A CHRISTMAS MISSIONHere we have the ideal young boys Christmas yarn, adapted from a memoir by humorist Jean Shepherd, who narrates throughout the film.NEVERTHELESS - FOR RALPHIE ITS ALL ABOUT REACHING HIS GOAL:We have a lofty goal - THE RED RYDER BB GUN under the tree! To reach this goal he must overcome the growing din of naysayers including his teacher and mother who insist: \"YOU'LL SHOOT YOUR EYE OUT!!!!!!To reach that goal we have objectives - giving clues to mom and dad, getting Miss Shields [5th grade teacher] to endorse the idea, and going directly to \"THE MAN\" - SANTA, to enlist his support.BUT THERE IS MORE - MUCH MORE!For starters, we have a ten year old's strange fantasies - having \"BLACK BART\" and his gang all \"pushing up daisies\" after a showdown with cowboy Ralphie and \"Old Blue\" [his Red Ryder].We have a dare that goes from bad to worse as it escalates into a \"Triple Dog Dare\"! What ensues, is simply something that we suggest you don't try at home. That is, unless you want to get your tongue frozen stuck to a pole?We have Bully's and their henchmen. We have really cool narration. Plus, we have Dad and his major award silliness, when he isn't fighting furnace fires, the Buppases dogs and just plain acting uncool in a perfect dad sort of way.Add to that, we have Chinese turkey and christmas themes, flat-tires, a soap poisoning fantasy, a little boy wearing a little girl's pink bunny outfit and the long awaited \"Little Orphan Annie\" decoder set with a letter countersigned by Annie in real ink! We have a little brother, an epiphany over mom and some typical school chums getting into trouble stuff too.There is very nice mood music mostly by Brass Ensemble, when its Christmas, and more fully orchestrated for \"The Grand Canyon Suite\" and other familiar tunes that are appropriate to the period [late 1940s in Northern urban Indiana]BOTTOM LINE:Super-duper entertainment that you can enjoy with the whole family. It never gets tiring and it actually grows on you over time. I first saw \"A Christmas Story\" at the Vero Beach [FLA] Drive-In in 1983, and I have looked forward to seeing it, dozens of times, since.ABOUT THE DVD:I have never seen the 2-Disk set. The single disk, full-screen version I do have is quite an improvement over the VHS version insofar as picture quality is concerned. There are NO FEATURES, and that is of course sad as this type of nostalgic film with child actors really would benefit from that. All in all, this is a great film to have on DVD as it seems to shout - PLAY ME AGAIN!\n",
      "A Christmas Story tends to touch people's hearts like few films do. I think the reason is many of them are now Baby boomers entering retirement! and this film brings back the nostalgia of their 1950's childhood, and it strikes a nerve. Yet, I think this film was suppose to be written for the 1940's...no matter, it will touch you (but even more if you are over 50).This is Ralphie's story, but Melinda Dillon, playing the typical 1940's stay-at-home mom and Darren McGavin as the grumpy but kindly father made the story work.Here are some scenes most folks over 50 might even remember...though it seems like lifetimes ago:New and beautiful toys displayed in department store windows...in my case Macys. Buying toys by mail order and then the agonizingly long wait for toys ordered via mail and learning too late they are not quite what was expected. The excitement of buying a Christmas tree, the joy of setting it up and how much bigger Christmas trees seemed then. Neighborhood bullies who were not nearly as tough as they seemed. Ralphie wanting a BB gun more than life itself. Mom covering trouble for Ralphie to his dad, and the same mom making him eat soap for uttering words -- learned from Dad. Randy sitting underneath the kitchen sink when depressed. A panicky visit to a tired Santa. An unwanted gift from a well-meaning aunt. The furious unwrapping of gifts on Christmas morning. There is so much more, but my review is getting too long.So, if you are middle age or older and have not seen A Christmas Story (hard to believe), or if you are younger and have not seen it, you really are missing an extraordinary touching, yet funny film.Buy or rent this DVD and It will be the best money you spend this Christmas -- or any Christmas.\n",
      "A yuletide tradition for my family (and many others, no doubt) that was a staple long before TBS started spamming it nonstop on Christmas Day every year. It's warm, funny, poignant and relatable without stretching itself thin and effortlessly captures the dueling heartaches and wonders that embodied the holiday season for many generations of American children. Infinitely quotable, its one-liners have yet to wear thin and the expertly-paced plot delivers both rose sniffing and speed racing with grand efficiency. One I'll never get tired of.\n",
      "Not too much in the way of mangers, hymns, sleigh bells jingling ring ting tingaling will be found here.  This is the story of Christmas gone wrong in suburban America.  It isn't, however, a pessimistic view of the failure of Christmas, it is a look at the redemption of family love, and the sick wonder of being a child.Welcome to a world of sick lamps that are shaped like legs, of demented Santa-costume wearing mall workers, of a childs dream to own a simple BB gun, of dogs who eat Christmas dinner.  Quite simply, everything that is humorously wrong about Christmas in America can be found in this movie.  It is one of the most hilarious portrayals of Christmas on film, and will have you laughing at every turn.Watch it with the family.  Celebrate our strange traditions in the best fashion.\n",
      "This is my all time favorite Christmas movie. I know the entire thing by heart and make my family mad by reciting all the lines everytime i watch it. Watch out when the 24-hour marathon comes on TV, Dec. 24.  :oEveryone needs to have, or at least SEE this movie.  Even the book (In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash) is great!  I highly recomend this movie to all ages, for all times of the year. \"Happy St. Patrick's Day! Let's watch A Christmas Story!\"\n",
      "An endearing Christmas Classic that will appeal to baby boomers and all ages alike.  The performances (one of Darrin McGavin's best), costumes, set docorations and the dialog (mostly narrated from POV of a young boy) are superb for such a low budget movie.  This is the flick that made old fashioned parental discipline like getting your mouth washed out with soap, the Red Rider rifle, bunny suit pajamas, Santa's \"Ho Ho Ho\", and the Buttkiss' dogs legends.  I think this is the BEST family Christmas movie ever made.  Watch it with your children, friends and relatives regardless of age, and have a very MERRY Christmas!!!\n",
      "Item came on time and was in brand new condition.  It was nice to watch it during the holidays when I had time instead of trying to catch it on TV.  Popped in\\t in the TV/DVD player in the kitchen and could pause and enjoy as I pleased.  Would recommend seller to anyone and will buy from them again....thanks\n",
      "The special features that have the cast commenting on the movie are almost as good as the movie itself.  This is a movie you can watch dozens of times and still laugh.  A must for Christmas!\n",
      "This is a Christmas movie that can be viewed repeatedly. We watched it with our childen and now watch with our granchild. The story is funny and keeps you interested. It is so real. The misguided enthusiasm of the dad, the vulnerabiliy of Ralphie, the deserate need of the older brother for the chistmas present and all the fantasising of how to accomplish getting it. So much like a child. So much hope. Give his movie a try. See if you laugh and recognise yourself in it.\n",
      "Yea, you will probably be able to catch it on TV around Christmas, but me - I am too busy to sit down and watch TV sometimes and always catch it part way through. So, I bought the DVD so I could watch it anytime - especially since I will be deployed at Christmas this year.That said, if you haven't seen it - you must! Chock full of hilarious scenes with an occasional voice over that takes me back to old TV classics.\n",
      "We watch it every year. We are off cable TV now. So we rented it. It is a classic movie for Xmas\n",
      "I was almost finished recording \"A Christmas Story\" on last Christmas morning. Fifteen minutes before it ended, my father walked in and said that we would get the special edition.That I didn't go postal at losing an hour and a half on something that would shortly be redundant shows how much I love \"A Christmas Story.\" This 1983 classic is not just a heartwarming little story about a loving (if bickery) family in the dour America of the late 1940s, but a hysterical comedy about what it's like to be a kid at Christmas.Ralphie Parker's (Peter Billingsley) Christmas wishes are simple: a official Red Ryder, carbine action, two-hundred shot range model air rifle with a compass and a \"thing that tells time.\" But his mom says he'll shoot his eye out. So Ralphie begins a quiet crusade to get it as a present -- he writes an essay on it and even asks Santa, only to get the same terrible reply: \"You'll shoot your eye out.\"As the days tick down to Christmas -- with no sign of an air rifle -- Ralphie hits other obstacles when he clashes with bullies, says \"the mother of all dirty words,\" and watches his parents battle it out over a tacky \"major award\" (leg lamp). But there are surprises in store for the Parker family on Christmas morning -- and some of them involve smelly bloodhounds.Yes, the plot is pretty simple -- it's the delivery that makes it special. It's narrated by an adult Ralphie who offers his slightly sardonic take on everything (\"We plunged into the cornucopia quivering with desire and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice\"), mingled with a hint of nostalgia. And it's completely tuned in to how kids think, and how a toy can seem like the most important thing in the world.Fortunately the scriptwriters never condescend to the audience by adding some kind of syrupy message -- after all, real life doesn't work that way. Instead there are all sorts of classic moments -- the leg lamp, Chinese turkey, the terrifying visit to Santa (\"HOOOO HOOOO HOOO!\"), and Ralphie's fantasies of defending his family with \"Ol' Blue\" against a bunch of inept, unarmed bandits.And Jean Shepherd -- the co-writer and narrator of the movie -- deserves especial credit for bringing this movie to life. He covers the movie with a snowstorm of one-liners and hilarious dialogue: \"Over the years I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap.\" \"He looks like a pink nightmare!\" \"Oh FUUUDDDDGGGE!\" and others.Billingsley is a little stiff as Ralphie, but gives the portrayal of this everykid his charming, slightly frenetic best. Melinda Dillon and Darin McGavin are the comic geniuses here, with their slightly kooky but loving parents (one of the highlights is Dillon's \"show me how the piggies eat!\" scene, and McGavin's revolted response), and there's an array of very convincing bullies and classmates too.\"A Christmas Story\" didn't get much notice when it came out in 1983. But now it's one of the quintessential holiday movies, and a must-see at Christmastime. HOOOOO HOOOOO HOOOO...\n",
      "One of the best Holidays movies ever made.  The casting for this movie was spot on and the acting was superb along with the storyline.\n",
      "I never stop laughing at this movie each year, no matter how many times I watch it! So glad its on Blu-Ray!\n",
      "I love this movie. Wonderful Christmas movie to sit down with the family too watch. I received it in a timely order & in one piece. I am very happy with the Christmas story! Thank u Amazon!!!\n",
      "My VHS copy bit the dust, or else my VCR did... HAD to have a DVD of a Christmas tradition! PS My nephew HATES it because he looked just. like. Ralphie. at that age and he does NOT like to be reminded of the fact!\n",
      "I make it my business to watch \"A Christmas Story\" every holiday season.  A major part of the charm of the film is the fact that it takes place in the 1940's, when charm was still in vogue and simplicity dominated the times.  Ironically, this is unfortunate because if the film translates to today's times, the BB gun would translate into a Macintosh with Windows, 256 MB of Ram, etc.  You get the idea.I thought Darren McGavin stole the show.  My favorite scene involved him and Ralphie changing the tire.  When Ralphie loses the nuts to the hubcaps, he says the \"Queen Mother\" of all curse words; the big one that didn't come out as \"fudge\".  McGavin told him to get into the car.  The camera stays on McGavin and you notice the least bit of a smirk on his face, as if to say \"I know Ralphie's a good kid.  This is just part of his growing up\".On all counts, this is a gem of a picture, with marvelous performances, directing and writing.  Almost every scene is memorable and can be bantered about over the holiday table.  Even if you don't laugh out loud after the 100th viewing, it is still as entertaining and fresh as it is with the 1st.\n",
      "Classic movie that will be around for decades and decades and decades and decades and decades and decades and decades.\n",
      "We didn't get to see it on Christmas day, so we ordered it. We just couldn't let a Christmas go by without seeing it this year. We always laugh so much while watching it. It is such a wonderful story for the family to watch together.\n",
      "I love this movie. I showed it to a class of English language learners. I was disappointed that subtitles were not available. It is very American, and my classes liked it despite having to stop occasionally for explanations. It was a good intro to American holidays\n",
      "I love the Christmas Story silver anniversary box set.  I learned that the DVD discs are the same as the 20th anniversary version.  Aside from the labels being different, this proved to be true.  I feel the content of the discs should be the same, as a measure to preserve this holiday classic.Other than that, I love the new content provided.  The canister the box set comes in is awesome.  The red apron and cookie cutter set are truly great.  The book that lists the cast and crew is very informative.As far as receipt of the box set for Christmas, I now have ownership of two of them.  One for enjoyment, and the other for future value.  My brother ordered the second copy from the Christmas Story House itself.  His girlfriend ordered me the first copy from Wal*Mart's website.If you love this movie, or are a serious collector like me, get your hands on this puppy before you shoot your eye out.\n",
      "We are many years removed from the 1983 release of A Christmas Story. Ralphie's all grown up, Darren McGavin has passed on, \"Flick\" entered the adult film business only to leave it in 2000. All these changes in the world, but the old saying is true. The more things change, the more they remain the same.The one thing that has remained the same is the timeless quality of this movie. All Ralphie wants for Christmas is his Red Rider BB Gun... Santa, his teacher... heck, even his own MOTHER battle against him, each lamenting \"You'll shoot your eye out!\"Undaunted, Ralphie carries on, hoping somebody will see the light and let him have his coveted BB GUN!I won't spoil the ending, but Ralphie does learn that Christmas is more than just what you get or where you go. It's not just about what you eat. It's about with whom you eat.When a memory is so powerfully branded onto a person's soul, it makes for a timeless retelling. This story provides just such a gift.\n",
      "Not only a great Christmas movie but a great movie.Great writing and narration by the late great writer,commentator and comic genius Jean Sheperd.\n",
      "How could you not like it. I never get tired of watching it and it looks great on blu ray.\n",
      "One of the best Christmas movies ever made.  Brings you back to a simpler time when the biggest discipline problems in schools were running in the hallways and chewing gum in class.\n",
      "nothing compares to making you feel as though you are alfie.  this movie inspires and makes you feel as though you're home. have loved for over 20 years now.\n",
      "I haven't actually watched the copy of this disc that I just bought, but I remember seeing it when it came out. Which is the reason I purchased it. If you haven't seen it, this movie may bring back memories of your own childhood and that one special gift you wanted Santa to bring you. It takes place in a time before my own, but is still relevant even today. My opinion..a must see.\n",
      "I remember going to see this movie in the theater when I was small.  I loved it and still do!!  It's hilarious and really a true classic.  My sons (10, 8, 4) love it as well.\n",
      "\"A Christmas Story (1983)\" is as perfect a holiday movie as was ever produced in Hollywood. I applaud this Special Edition to be released, which provides the first-ever DVD version of the movie in the widescreen format, with a secondary disc of expected extras. If ever a Christmas movie deserved special treatment, it is this film.The movie is absolutely unique: a non-traditional yule time tale surrounding one special Christmas in the life of 9-year-old Ralphie Parker. Somehow, it manages at the same time to provide not just a laugh-out-loud hysterical glimpse of events, but a loving, tender, almost reverential look at homespun holiday traditions and cherished American values. In doing so, it completely transcends the genre and becomes not just a classic first-rate holiday movie, but a classic first-rate movie. In fact, Siskel and Ebert put it on their 10 best films list of 1983.Based on a segment from the brilliant novel \"In God We Trust,\" by Jean Shepherd (who also helped pen the screenplay and narrates the movie as the adult Ralphie), the story is set in Indiana during the 1940s, but was filmed with a timeless quality evoking the rich images of Norman Rockwell illustrations unexpectedly combined with touches of Tim Burton-like looniness. Well-deserved kudos should go to Director Robert Clark III.Like most kids, Ralphie's world revolves around Christmas and enduring school until the holiday break. This year, Ralph has been waging a campaign to receive the greatest Christmas present in the history of Christmas presents: a Red Ryder BB gun, with a compass in the stock. Unfortunately, his mother believes he is likely to \"shoot his eye out,\" so she is resolutely against the gift.It is against this backdrop that we meet Ralph's family, his mother and father (whose first names we never learn), and younger brother Randy, along with a host of Ralph's friends and his school teacher. We also meet the classic school ground bully, Scut (not Scott) Farcus, who is so vicious that he has yellow eyes (\"I swear to God, yellow eyes\"), and his little \"toadie\" henchman.Through the Parker family, we are privy to the weeks leading up to Christmas, and the grand day itself. Along the way, we are given so many memorable events that it is impossible to relate them all here. Meatloaf, the purchase of a Christmas tree, a certain curse word, a very \"leggy\" lamp, a tongue frozen to a flag pole, a grumpy Santa, triple-dog dare, Lifebouy soap, a blimp, Chinese turkey, and a movie-long battle between \"The Old Man\" and the furnace are only a few of the unforgettable gems.The talented cast, which includes Peter Billingsley as Ralphie and Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin as his parents, shine as brightly as Christmas stars.If you have never seen this movie, you owe it to yourself and your family to take this opportunity and watch it. The movie has the power to change the way you look at Christmas, and Christmas films forever. For me, it has become a yearly mainstay, as moving and memorable as \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" or any other holiday film. It is my Red Ryder BB gun, \"the best Christmas present I ever received, or would ever receive.\"\n",
      "First of all, this is, aside from Dickens' classic \"A Christmas Carol,\" the best Christmas movie ever made. If you and your family have still somehow missed seeing this movie, make sure to buy the DVD, or at least tune in Christmas Eve and watch it on TBS. It is the kind of movie that will be immortalized throughout time.The DVD is okay. The interviews are pretty decent on the 2nd disc, and the interactive games are fun. However, the biggest complaint I have is the lack of a remastered audio track. I incorrectly assumed that this would at least be in Dolby Digital 5.1, but then I realized it listed Dolby 2.0 mono. I said \"okay, well at least it's in 2-channel audio.\" HA! After popping in the DVD to check it out, the only English track for the movie(without commentary) is in ONE channel audio, through the center speaker! YIKES! I'll keep this DVD for the time being, but I'll sell it or pass it on when I get my hands on a Blue Ray player and (hopefully) a Blue Ray disc with enhanced audio.\n",
      "Gave this DVD to my two sister in laws cause they love the show.  They absolutely love the DVD.  Great Christmas movie and gift.\n",
      "A enjoyable trip back into the past. A new Christmas entertainment trip in the future with family and friends. Enjoy!\n",
      "The first BlueRay movie we ordered when we upgraded our old tiny TV and VCR was A Christmas Story.  It is a family classic and makes us laugh throughout the movie.  My husband and I grew up during the time Ralphie did so it is even more real for us.  Oh, and I had that BB gun and never shot my eye out.  Did hit some bullseyes, though...\n",
      "This is a wonderful gift to give to Christmas Story fans.  I should have bought myself one. And delivery was prompt and packaged great.  No dents in can.\n",
      "Classic christmas movie in beautiful blu ray picture. Makes a big difference having it in blu ray vs dvd. Bought to play at work and everyone loves it.\n",
      "This (and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation) is *the* classic Christmas movie.  I can watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it.  It perfectly captures the anticipation leading up to getting the right gift as well as all normal craziness ocurring in a family.  You'll never look at a pile of mashed potatoes or a bar of soap in quite the same way again.\n",
      "It's a classic Christmas movie that continues to make people laugh for generations to come.\n",
      "We truly love this movie and want to keep the tradition with our kids so we ordered this classic movie on DVD to have forever! We ordered it and received it quickly and we love Amazon for all our movies they have great prices-\n",
      "Favorite Christmas movie. Really appreciate the 48 hour rental as during the holidays it's hard to find time to watch an entire movie in one sitting.  Wish iTunes would do the same.\n",
      "One of the best. A Christmas Eve tradition. Classic, funny, and all around great movie. I can't wait to share this Holiday tradition with my nephew.\n",
      "This has to be the best Christmas comedy filmed so far.  As an old timer I saw some very familiar items they used for props.  I even had a wind-up tank just like the one shown briefly under the tree.  This one had it all.....and without any profanity even with you knew there was searing going on.  I like it so much that after streaming it I bought the DVD for next year.\n",
      "I purchased this item as a gift and the recipiant was very happy with it.....a classic christmas gift for sure!\n",
      "I have been watching this movie since it came out in the late 80's.  I watch it at least twice a year.  Sometimes  in midsummer to offset the doldrums and then most definitely at Christmas. For anyone who grew up in the fifties and sixties - ti will bring back many memories.\n",
      "best movie ever.  at least for the holidays. it is great i can just point and click and have a movie ready for me. I kinda wish I could do that with my tps reports and my wife when I want to have dinner.\n",
      "The BluRay disc arrived 2 days after it was purchased and was still in the new plastic wrapping. No complaints!\n",
      "love this movie. A co-worker reminded me of this movie this pass Christmas and to watch it on TNT, and I did , all day for twenty-four hours. Each time I see something that I missed before. I ordered one for my co-worked and one for me. This is a great family film to watch with my family, friends and grand children,  and I'm sure to enjoy it in many years to come.\n",
      "I really believe when the history of the movie industry is finally completed, four movies will be tied for best Christmas movie.  They will be; \"It's a Wonderful Life\", \"Miracle On 34th Street\", \"a Christmas Story\", and 'Home Alone\". Second place will go to one of the many versions of Dicken's \"A Christmas Carol\".  \"Christmas Story\" is my personal favorite of the four.I was somewhat surprised that the story was set in the forties. I had always that it was in the fifties when I was in my preteens.  On looking closer, I see that it could have just as easily been the thirties, forties, fifties, or even the early sixties. The movie is really set at a time outside of history called \"childhood\". The true wonder of this movie is how vividly it brings back memories of early youth, no matter when you were born.Give full credit to Jean Shepherd. The measure of the success of this movie is the faithfulness in which it brings his characters and stories to life.  His narrative in voice over is one of the highlights of the film. The wonderful combination of sentiment and satire sparkles through the show like bubbles in a glass of ginger ale. Not too sweet and just sharp enough.Enough said about the movie itself. It's a classic and you need it in your collection.  You owe it to your family.This version, the twentieth anniversary, double disc special edition is exceptionally good.  After viewing the movie, go back and view it with the commentary by Bob Clarke and Peter Billingsley. That alone is worth the price of the set.  But, that's not all. There's also a whole extra special feature disk with goodies for the whole family. There's the true story of the the Daisy Red Rider BB gun, a featurette showing the making of the movie and.. Wonder of Wonders... a trip to the Factory that makes the Glorious LAMP. There are also some nice interactive games for the kids, but the biggest treat on the second disk is the audio readings by Jean Shepherd of two of the stories from which the movies were made. I don't care if you did just see the movie. He will hold you spellbound in front of the image of an old radio.  He is that good!I wish that I had more stars to give this set. It is AWESOME!\n",
      "I always enjoyed this movie from the very first time I watched it as a teenager. The value of the story and the impression that this movie made on me at that time have stayed with me since. I was very excited when I saw that this movie was available on Amazon and quickly purchased it. I love the movie, love the story and recommend this to anyone who might be on the fence.\n",
      "We love this crazy Christmas movie.  It was so much easier to view and enjoy in the blu ray version.\n",
      "We tried to buy this and it was sold out everywhere!  I can't to watch it again this Christmas with my family!\n",
      "Another great Christmas movie, one of my favorites.  Shipped the same day ordered and arrrived before Christmas.  New product so no issues\n",
      "A Christmas Classic of the holiday traditions in a 1940's America.  Childhood avarice for inappropriate toys and the campaign through the Christmas season to gain the treasure he wants most.  A wonderful and fun tale for the whole family.\n",
      "For whatever reason, I never saw this movie despite hearing about it a lot. It was good, not spectacular, but good. The actors were good and it was interesting to get a glimpse into life in the 40s.\n",
      "Well, by now everyone has at least heard of this movie, but to sum up why it's such a classic: it's timeless. Sure, the setting and the props could change to \"modernize\" it, but in the end this is a kids' eye view of life, particularly the Christmas season. Ralphie, the main character, has to deal with bullies and disappointment, parents and schoolteachers. A great film for any age!\n",
      "this is the type of movie i like to sit with my entire family and watch every yeat around the  holidays. It's great fun with lots of laughs and moments of looking back to my own childhood and the anticipation of a particular christmas gift from santa claus.\n",
      "this is something you need to get, it's a great christmas movie that to me rivals rudolph as the traditional christmas movie that you watch on christmas, it's funny, it's a classic, and shows what christmas was like back in the 40's aswell, great for the family, oh AND IT'S IN BLU-RAY!\n",
      "There must be at least a hundred films and TV specials that deal with Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, etc. All of them range from the greatest to the worst, and A Christmas Story is one of the greatest. A majority of this country's population have seen this film, and I'm sure all of them now love it right after they've watched it (well, ALMOST all of them, now that I've seen the current reviews here on Amazon). I should be included on the list of those who love it. I mean, this is a definite classic. It's both hilarious and touching at the same time. Along with It's a Wonderful Life and Home Alone, every single minute of this film is almost flawless. It's also one of those films in which you can memorize much of the dialogue, not to mention the many sight gags (tongue on frozen pole, anyone?). I think my favorite scenes are the ones involving soap and lamps . . . I won't give out any spoilers for those who haven't seen it yet. Speaking of which, if you haven't seen this Christmas classic just yet, give it a shot, especially on Christmas Eve. You'll quickly understand why it's considered one of the greatest Christmas films of all time.Grade: A\n",
      "This is now a family tradition. What a great movie! This is fun for all ages but I think those a little older will really get it.\n",
      "I really can't say anything new that hasn't been said about this great movie, except read Jean Shepherd's novels...you will get a whole new appreciation for the movie and the characters that have become a part of so many of our lives.Thank you Darren McGavin for giving us the best Christmas Present ever!\n",
      "I'm not a big fan of holiday shows, but this a favorite of mine regardless of the genra. A must watch during the Christmas season.\n",
      "Revised 12/09:  The 2003 \"Anniversay\" edition of the DVD is now out of print, making this the only deluxe version of the movie available at the current time.  A year ago, there were two identical Christmas Story DVD sets on the market at the same time, and this was the more expensive of the two.  Seeing as how this is no longer and issue, I'm upping the score for this item from three stars to five.Original review:Don't get me wrong - I love \"A Christmas Story,\" and I would give the film a 5-star review.  The issue here is that the 2008 DVD release is EXACTLY the same as the 2003 version (aside from some slightly different artwork on the slipcover and case).  There are no new special features, and the print quality is the same as before.  There is absolutely no need for the studio to release this needless double dip DVD.  If you don't already own the 2003 version, then this is a must have DVD; if you do, there's no need to buy the new version, unless you go for the Ultimate Collector's Edition, which has some neat extras (which admittedly aren't worth the price if you already own the film on DVD).  Check out the Blue-ray version if you're looking for slightly improved picture quality.\n",
      "Needed to pick this up to add to my Christmas movie library. Great price with Prime shipping and the quality of the Blu-Ray is good. You can only make footage this old look so good in HD, but it does a good job upgrading over standard def. for sure. A must have for anyone's library.\n",
      "This has so much of what we want our kids and young adults to see and learn about.  As a parent and grandparent I know it is hard to find moveies that instill values in these troubling times.  My hat is off to the cast and crew and director. I give it a 5 out of 5 spatulas turned up!\n",
      "A Christmas Story is such a classic Christmas Story. It is funny, silly, and an All-American classic family. It is definitely a keeper!\n",
      "I have two young kids and even though they don't get the added bonus of understanding that the narrative approach is an homage to an earlier era of story telling, they just love Ralphie. Makes us all smile.\n",
      "There are a number of movies that enhance my Christmas experience every year.  \"Miracle on 34th Street\" (the real one, with Maureen O'Hara, and not the dreadful remakes), \"Holiday Inn,\" and television shows like the Peanuts  masterpiece.I admit that I, like most folks, get nostalgic for a Christmas that sometimes seems so far off that it never really happened.However, movies like this help me recapture some of the magic that Christmas meant when I was a boy (a local department store, Miller and Rhodes, now gone, had the REAL Santa, and you could have lunch with him and have Rudolph cake, in which you looked for hoof prints -- you know, that kind of thing), and that's not a bad thing, not at all.If you have somehow missed the 7,889 times this film is run during the Christmas season, grab it up now.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want Chinese food -- magic.\n",
      "This movie is a classic, although people play it too much on TBS, but anyway it is a great film and I love it. But be weary it gets addicting. You will laugh at some points and other points you will be saying to yourself, \"What the...?\" It's good, so take a look at it.\n",
      "I was really happy to hear they were finally coming out with A Christmas story on DVD. Don't get me wrong, the VHS was good, but DVD's are always much more clear, and you can get really neat special features on them.When 9-year old Ralphie Parker starts obsessing about a Red Ryder 200 shot range model air rifle around Christmas time, he will come up with any scheme to get his parents to know that he wants that for Christmas. In the way of doing, he must dogde getting in trouble with his parents for saying terrible words, beating up school bullies, and complaining. He must somehow get his teacher to sympathise with his plot too, with a theme for homework, and maybe a little bribe here and there. All these things may lead to Mayhem, but they sure do make a funny story when it comes to getting gifts. Will Ralphie prevail with his dream gift or will Santa smash his hopes? Only Christmas will decide that.I thought the acting was great, especilly with Ralphies little brother Randy, always being a pushover. I recommend this movie to anyone, but I also recommend the book, \"In God We Trust, All others pay cash\" by Jean Shepard. Definetely a great addition to your DVD library.\n",
      "What a wonderful story.I never get tired of seeing it whether it is my own copy  or on TV during the Holidays.\n",
      "This movie is must Christmas Classic to own.  Not a year goes by that I do not watch this movie several times.  I already got a round in.  :)\n",
      "This movie is one of my favorite Christmas movies ever.  I ordered the package in December and was happy to get it in time and in great conditon.\n",
      "Favorite!!!!! One of our family's great traditions on a cold December night.  Fills the house with laughter and warmth. Great movie!\n",
      "Watching this every year is a great Christmas tradition.  Simply a classic.  Just make sure your kids are old enough - not appropriate for little peeps.\n",
      "Though sometimes a bit quaint and sometimes requiring some patience, this movie is at times hilarious!  The kid is an goon-natured schemer, while the dad is an eccentric buffoon!\n",
      "This film never gets old no matter how old I get.  It's completely classic.\n",
      "A Christmas Story is not only the greatest Christmas film ever made, it is one of the greatest films ever made, period! This is a perfect film! Darren McGavin as \"the old man\" gives of the greatest performances not to be nominated for an Oscar. Melinda Dillon is just great as the mom. Peter Billingsley is perfect as Ralphie. Every single character is memorable, how often is that. Full of wall-to-wall hilarious dialogue, in-fact the whole film is quotable! The film looks just right and feels just right! An essential film that everyone sould see! A+\n",
      "I love this movie and all the cool geeky stuff that came with it as a great bonus. It just isn't Christmas without this movie!\n",
      "I have lost track of how many times that I have seen this movie over the years, but it still cracks me up every single time.  Christmas is not the same unless I get to see this movie at least once.  The time line may have been set before I was born, but the story line holds true for all people no matter what they ever wanted for Christmas.  This movie is good natured, sweet and funny all the way though.\n",
      "I bought this for my wife. This her favorite Christmas movie. I am happy it is now offered on Blu ray.\n",
      "My wife first saw this movie when she was a teenager....she saw it again when it appeared on Cable and recorded it :)Sadly, we moved and had to give the Cable/DVR box back, so we lost it...so I re-ordered it here on Amazon.com.If you only every see ONE Christmas movie, make it this one!!! You will NOT be disappointed!!!\n",
      "My wife and I have been watching this movie for many years on an old VHS copy, this year we sprang for a new DVD Blu-ray copy; picture and sound are outstanding, by the way.Not only are the Christmas scenes great for this time of year, but the whole mood of small-town America around the early 1940s will take you back to a time where family was important and people went out in public instead of watching TV at night. (They do listen to the radio for entertainment, though.)Hope you'll enjoy \"A Christmas Story\" this year, too!\n",
      "Yes, it's a Christmas classic and one of the funniest movies ever. Witty and blunt and a take on the American family. But a warning to those of you who already own the earlier version and are planning to buy this version  because of widescreen.....IT'S NOT IN WIDESCREEN AS STATED. That is an  Amazon misprint. Even the box itself states \"Standard (full-screen)  only.\" Amazon still rules regardless.\n",
      "A Classic Christmas yarn,told in wonderfully charming way. A perfect cast for a perfect script. one for the whole family that can be watched many times.\n",
      "Who would give this movie anything less than five stars?  It's the best lazy-day holiday movie out there.  I usually follow this up with some Monty Python for good measure.\n",
      "Great great, great, great, great movie, needs to buffer more so not so choppy. Amazon, can this issue be resolved?\n",
      "A co-worker brought in a replica Leg Lamp to add to our Xmas decorations at the office. While not politically correct in this day of sexual harassment awareness, it brought back great memories of watching this movie for the first time. I rushed home to rent the movie from amazon to share with my family. This is a true Xmas classic. And, I did not have to wait for the TBS marathon. :)\n",
      "Author Jean Shepherd's ability to publish his boyhood memoirs and then narrate them flawlessly in this 1983 movie \"A Christmas Story\" is an Annual Holiday treat for the entire family. He captures pre-WWII America still in their humor & innocence with perfection.A must for the family HOLIDAY LIBRARY!!! (even with the FULL SCREEN format, you can pretend that it was before widescreen).Perfectly cast and a most delightful tale on an Indiana family during the Christmas Holidays of 1940. Radio was the evenings entertainment (Little Orphan Annie). And family outings (Christmas tree shopping, the towns Christmas Parade, Departmnet Store shopping and the visit to see, ask Santa for those well deserved toys. (You'll shoot your eye out, kid!)) were the holiday norm.A great movie, one of the best for the entire family to enjoy!!! Pull up a chair, sit down, watch and listen to Jean Shepherds delightful narration of \"A Christmas Story\".\n",
      "Peter Billingsley is wonderful in this snow day classic.  Great any time of the year! HI-Larious!Amazon seller great, fast shipping!\n",
      "Next to \"It's A Wonderful Life\" this is our family Christmas classic. I love this movie - it is very well done; reminds me of my childhood (yes, I am over 60) and has nothing (language, sex, violence) to offend viewers. I love this movie.\n",
      "One I can watch over and over and over, I never get tired of watching it. I'm glad TNT puts it on nonstop...\n",
      "This is such a fun story. I have to see it every holiday season or my Christmas is lacking something really special.  This is really special.\n",
      "Classic great cast. Always a huge family favorite.  Excited to view in Blu Ray format. A Merry Christmas to all\n",
      "This Hoilday Christmas classic will never get old. Every Christmas this film always played non-stop on the TNT network that should probably will ruin its welcome. But it doesn't. I just gave it four stars because I don't this isn't all perfect. But Jean Shepard delightfully narrates the story during the 40's and it's about a boy named Ralphie(Peter Billingsley) who desperatly wants a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas. Chaos ensues for poor Ralphie because everyone bawks and says \"You'll shoot your eye out!.\" I like the characters very much including Ralphie's dad who loves his prize from a radio contest: a sexy leg lamp. One of my favorite scenes is during Ralphie and his brother visit a department store Santa and bawks the same mantra: \"You'll shoot your eye out\" and hits Ralphie's head and says, \"Ho, Ho, Ho.\" But there's one scene that everyone remembers when Ralphie's friend is \"double-dogged dared\" to stick his tongue to a frozen pole at school. He does and it's hilarious! This film is sweet in alot of ways, it gives us a sense of realiom as well as warm humanity. Billingsley is great by the way who presents us with fun skill. So everyone drink egg nog, open your presents and watch this hoilday classic with your family on Christmas day.\n",
      "Its a a family tradition and with all the Political correctness and sensitivity to those invading America I glad to have the dvd so i don;t have to guess if it going to air on TV anymore.\n",
      "This film capture a feeling of the holiday from the start. The attention to detail on the sets is amazing, and the acting is superb, you really lose yourself in this film.\n",
      "A wonderful Christmas story from days gone by. It brought back memories of my childhood. The only problem with the DVD was that at a few minutes before the end of the story, the DVD skipped, and stopped for a couple minutes and finally continued on to end the story.\n",
      "For those that grew up anywhere near this time this movie always brings back memories!  What a fun flick!  Glad I finally added it to my collection.\n",
      "I see that readers are steadily panning the Christmas Story special edition DVD because they feel that the matted film version is somehow cutting them short on their movie, but I have learned plenty on spherical (matted) films, widescreen, letterboxing and even the dreadful \"Super 35.\"Many of the movies filmed now are being shot with film that is actually in NTSC television aspect ratio (1.33- 1.37:1), even though the movie in the theatrical release is either \"widescreen\" 1.85:1 and even letterboxed (2.35:1).Christmas Story was filmed in the spherical format by using matting. The theatrical presentation is identical to the presentation on the DVD @ 1.85:1 when matted. But the reason the producers enjoy this deceptive format is so that the transfer to the old TV format won't lose vital subject content since the movie isn't cropped but expanded when the mat is removed to allow the film to fill your TV screen.The same deception is evident with films like Kill Bill and many of the movies filmed by directors who swear by the format like James Cameron. Terminator 2 for instance was filmed in Super 35, which uses a matting process that is a hybrid format; this allows the director to frame in letterbox using matting process to maintain the widescreen, and the matting process is removed so that the actual film (shot in TV format) will be transferred to TV without the need of cropping, which streamlines the film to video transfer as a money- and time- saving option.Spherical process is used in such titles as Bull Durham, Terminator, American Pie, Caddyshack I and II, and Glory.Super 35 is used in titles like American Beauty, 8 Mile, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Matrix and the Lord of the Rings trilogy.True letterbox movies use an anamorphic process that compresses the image by using a special lens on the camera to compress the image as it strikes the unexposed film. As the processed film is shown, a special projection lens is needed to draw the image back out, extending the image into widescreen. But if the decision is made to make a film transfer to fill the TV format, over 1/3 of the image would need to be cropped, and the transfer generally would mean using a \"pan and scan\" process to allow the image to be seen.Examples of the process: Star Wars Episode IV (A New Hope), the Die Hard trilogy, Jaws, and Hunt for Red October.Because the anamorphic process used in filming yields true wide screen, you'll see plenty of pan & scan whenever the movie is transferred to full frame; however, with matted and Super 35, you'll actually see more of the top and bottom of a movie filmed with this process. There are sometimes things like microphones that can be seen in the full screen presentation since matting makes it difficult for the director to see such things during filming. Any DVD that has both \"widescreen\" and \"full screen\" videos will give you a great comparison. For those who want to see more detail on the film process and tech specs, try imdb.com, which gives great information on probably any title you are curious about.The film industry has no standardized format, which leads to this unnecessary confusion. And with the new digital medium in home video and movie production, I'm sure the screen aspect ratio information will get even more confusing. But don't send back your DVDs.\n",
      "These movie is far beyond 'on it's way to becoming a classic'.  I watch this movie each and every Christmas on TV, and love it the past few years when a station has it on for the 24 hours started mid-Christmas Eve and ending when the it's time for us kids to head upstairs to play w/ our new gear while the adults cook.  This movie is priceless-the acting and storylines are superb. I love the part where the boy gets his tounge stuck and when Ralphie's little brother keeps hiding under the sink..Oh hey, it's all good!\n",
      "Classic - anytime you need a lift watch this movie. All generations will love this movie. A must for your collection.\n",
      "Our whole family watches this film every year. It is a tradition in our lives. We laugh every time, and can recite the dialog..\n",
      "Watching this wonderfully nostalgic program has been a family tradition for many years now.  I recently purchased the CD as a gift for friends.\n",
      "Once in a great while a movie comes along that pleasantly surprises us, and this is one of them.  I first saw this movie at a friend's family's house (who always had videos playing) during the holidays, and have seen it  popping up more and more every year. It deserves the overdue recognition.  This is the kind of movie where it doesn't matter where you come in, you'll  watch until it's over. Highly recommended.\n",
      "The only thing that could make this classic holiday fare better was to get it on Blu-Ray.  I watched this again this Christmas with my kids and it was better than ever.  A true christmas classic.\n",
      "Some parents wait until their child is older due to some Santa issues. This movie takes you back to old time memories of the Christmas Season. It's a keeper.\n",
      "This is an iconic Christmas film.  I love to introduce it to someone who has never seen it at Christmastime. It is so 1940's.\n",
      "I love this movie! It brings me back to my childhood. A great family tradition and fun for the whole family!\n",
      "I AM OF THE GENERATION WHEN FAMILIES HAD FEWER THINGS AND LIFE WAS MORE OF A STRUGGLE. I HAD SEEN THIS MOVIE EVERY YEAR SINCE IT CAME OUT. MY ROOMMATE HAD NEVER SEEN IT. WE BOTH HAD GREAT FUN WATCHING AND COULD UNDERSTAND THINGS LIKE THE STRUGGLES WITH A CONTRARY FURNANCE, AGGRAVATING NEIGHBORS WITH DOGS. THE LYE SOAP IN THE MOUTH FOR CURSING AND THE BULLIES AMD VARIOUS MINE FIELDS OF CHILDHOOD. A B GUN WAS A BOY'S DREAM COME TRUE AND  PINK BUNNIE PAJAMAS HIS WORSE NIGHTMARE.\n",
      "If you have never seen this movie all the way thru it is a must see movie! We  watch this at least twice every  christmas ! Never gets old!\n",
      "What is not to like here? Events leading up to Christmas Day provide the backdrop for this yarn as narrated by the late, great Jean Shepard.\n",
      "Watch it every holiday season with our grown kids and grandkids.  Brings back memories of Christmases past.  A great DVD to get the memorie juices flowing.\n",
      "I  like this movie, watching it is part of our family's Christmas tradition. Brings back memories of the Fifties and winter in Canada.\n",
      "Super movie, brings back memories, very funny, a joy to watch.  Highly recomended.\n",
      "A classic movie of all time!  Definitely would recommend it to everyone.  We watch this movie every year on Christmas Eve =)\n",
      "This is easily, hands down, one of my all time favorite Christmas movies. IF you havn't seen it, just buy it and watch it. Watch it every year for Christmas. Maybe its because I have seen it every year since I can remember. Maybe because it seems so close to home. Maybe I wish my family was like that, and it kinda makes you feel what it was like when Christmas actually WAS Christmas. It is not about gifts, ipods, iPads, computers, technology, or any of that garbage that means nothing. Its a story about a family from a kids perspective when all he really wanted was 1 simple gift, and his quest to get there. The writing is great, and its just a fun movie to watch. It has it all. Just watch it. You'll love it!\n",
      "Even if you did not grow up in the era, you will find yourself remembering \"that one\" Christmas gift you had to have. For me it was a toy sewing machine. Luckily no one told me that I'd stick a needle in my eye.\n",
      "I rarely give anything 5 stars, but this movie deserves it.  This is one of the exceptionally rare timeless classics that you can watch year after year and still laugh yourself to tears every time.  I  laughed when I was a kid because my parents were just as bad.  I laugh when I'm an adult because...now I'm the dysfunctional parent doing the exact same stuff.  The acting is so good that I sometimes have to remind myself that the kids in the movie haven't died of old age yet because the plot takes place in the 1940s.\n",
      "Its just a great family movie, its funny and it just one of those to do movies for the season, like White Christmas & Its a Wonderful life.\n",
      "My husband and I enjoyed the movie, but the streaming was inconsistent.  The disruptions were annoying at the least and we expect more from Amazon!\n",
      "I love this move one of My most watched special Christmas movie and should be on every Christmas shelf. The blue-Ray transfer is spectacular and looks great for such a old movie. Just has to be seen for Christmas.\n",
      "I remember when this first aired on TV back in the 80s. The next day I went to work and one of my fellow workers comes up and asks if I saw it. I said \"Yeah! It was great! Reminded me of when I was a kid! And the guy who played the father looks just like my Dad!\" My friend says \"Yeah! Me too! Not that the father looked like my Dad but we had a car just like that. And the town in the film was just like my hometown too.\" I said 'Yeah mine too!\" We could relate to this film more than probably any other movie ever made. It was like looking at a film of our individual youth histories! He grew up in Pontiac and Flint Michigan with all the car factories and I grew up in Allentown/Bethlehem Pennsylvania with Mack Trucks and Bethlehem Steel! We had a huge store in my town named \"Hess's\", five stories tall and half a city block square. Huge. Everybody shopped \"Hess's\". It's not there anymore. Sorry to say that. Of course I'm not there anymore either. But it was just like the store in the movie! And the toys were pretty much the same too. I never had a BB gun. An air rifle but no BBs! And my dad worked nights (and days too. he had two jobs!) so I hardly ever saw him growing up. I had a sister, my buddy had two brothers. But the town and the school depicted were just like ours. The film takes place somewhat earlier in time than when he or I were young boys of eight but not by much. We grew up in the 50s. The film takes place either in the late 30s or the early 40s or maybe the later 40s. Can't really tell. My Dad had a 49 Buick Roadmaster! A real tank of a car! Huge. Very simliar to the car in the film. And to top it off Ralphie looks like me when I was eight! Love this movie! But why buy it when TBS runs the film every Christmas for 24 hours? Just had to add it to my collection! Enjoy!\n",
      "Anyone who hasn't already seen this movie must.  It has, as it should, earned a place in history next to A Miracle on 34th St. and It's a Wonderful Life as a Christmas Classic movie.  Most people over 30 years old, and few under, will be able to relate to Ralphie, the nine year old boy who tries throughout the entire movie to convince his parents, teacher, and even Santa Claus that he should get a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas.  But Ralphie gets the same response from everyone: \"You'll shoot your eye out.\"  Ralphie does not relent in his pursuit of the Red Ryder BB gun, and shows life as a nine year old in other ways: Little Orphan Annie decoder pins, the neighborhood bully, double dog dares, having a little brother, swearing, and the next door neighbor's pack of hound dogs that constantly torment his father.The movie is based on a portion of the book \"In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash\" by Jean Shepherd.\n",
      "Love this movie.  Always thought we had it but now that I am older and realized one ofthe children took it with them, had to have my own copy.\n",
      "Charming movie with lots of memories of how things used to be, for someone born in 60's like me.  Not sappy at all.\n",
      "My family and I ordered A Christmas Story because it's a tradition to watch it Christmas Eve and Day each year.  We have not had cable for about a year now and ordering it on Amazon.com through our Playstation 3 was fast and easy the streaming quality was great and we were able to keep our tradition.\n",
      "I have this movie in the full screen edition and am looking to upgrade to the Blu-ray edition. I watch this movie over and over between Thanksgiving and Christmas and it gets me in the holiday spirit. A Christmas classic that everyone should own.\n",
      "First of all I would like to say BRAVO to TBS for showing 24hrs of a Christmas Story!!!  I love this movie it's a great holiday classic that I look forward to watching every Christmas and if I simply can't wait that long (which is every year) I just pop in the movie and watch it any time I want.My children each have a copy on VHS and this year we bought it on DVD. They love it as much as I do. And why not? Its a great movie, I know it's not It's a Wonderful Life, or Miracle on 34th ST, but it's a great Christmas movie just the same.I remember watching it as a kid and laughing so hard I nearly fell off my chair. It's a great movie for the whole family to watch together.I love the funny little scenes like the \"Triple Dog Dare\" and when the icecicle knocks Ralphie's glasses off and he thinks he really did shoot his eye out like everone told him he would do. And how about that awful lamp of his dads??The whole movie every one tells Ralphie \"You'll shoot your eye out kid!\" yet he still has his heart set on getting one that he does everything he can to get one. Like some kids, he just had to learn the hard way and gave us a good laugh in the process.I would recomend this movie to anyone that likes a good humerous, yet sweet Christmas movie.\n",
      "I've always seen bits and pieces of this movie and finally rented it. Definitely took me back to the time of my childhood memories during Christmas time. Good addition to your collection of Christmas movies.\n",
      "This movie has become a classic and it deserves to be - especially for those of us who grew up in the 40's and 50's and remember a simpler time.  Great laughs and great memories.\n",
      "I had waited years to watch this movie and I am so glad that I ordered it. It is a timeless classic and makes you feel good after watching it.\n",
      "I bought it as a Christmas gift for some of my grandchildren. They loved it.  (:  This movie will never get old,generations can enjoy it together.\n",
      "A Christmas Story DVDA Christmas Story (Two-Disc Special Edition)was shipped quickly and the price was right.  We enjoyed it very much.\n",
      "This was a gift for my husband and we enjoyed it together.  It is still a very funny movie!!\n",
      "It arrived in good time.  I don't have access to seeing it on TV, so now I can watch it anytime, even in July!\n",
      "Along with National Lampoons Christmas vacation, this movie is a holiday classic we watch every year. We has to own it.\n",
      "... with this movie, you go back to the good old days when Peter's biggest concern (as Ralphie, the character he played in the film) was  getting \"an official Red Ryder, carbine action, two-hundred shot range  model air rifle\" for Christmas, despite everyone (even a  department-store Santa) telling him he'd put his eye out.It's a flight  of fancy, incredibly funny, and a movie with which anyone who was ever a  little boy can identify.  Definitely one of those movies that needs to be  pulled out and viewed every Christmas along with classics like \"It's a  Wonderful Life\".\n",
      "A great show that unlike most of its era only get better over the years. So many great qoutes! \"Only I didn't say 'fudge'\". Lols.\n",
      "I don't think I've missed watching this since it came out years ago, and to think that almost shelved this one, thank goodness they didn't\n",
      "We wanted to get that movie this year so that we could watch it any time we wanted. I could go on and on , but who would want to read that?\n",
      "This movie speaks for itself and is always a movie to look forward in watching at Christmas.Happy New Year...!\n",
      "This is an ALL-TIME CLASSIC FAVORITE of mine. Being a film-purist (MA in cinema studies--my shameless plug), I do not say this lightly.10-stars for the movie and 1 star for the DVD. Read on:This is \"liquid literature\", i.e., literature on film. This is one of the few instances in filmdom where voice-overs are not only used properly, but are motivated by the film's style, disposition, and character. Form definately dictated the function of voice-over on this one, as should always be the case. Hearing Jean Shepherd's (author) voice-overs alone justifies the price of this DVD.But ALL aspects are flawlessly executed: writing, director's tone, acting, texture/mood created by lighting, sets, ensemble cast (the children's performances match those achieved by Spielberg in ET), etc ... Darren McGavin sunk personal resources into this project as a \"labor of love,\" and we are blessed, for what a tragedy to filmdom had this film never been realized.However, DVD itself is a disappointment. It is full-screen, not widescreen. I echo the comments made by previous users. This film is worthy of a complete digital remastering, both visually and aurally, and released in widescreen. I'd gladly pay a special price for such a classic edition of this timeless treat. These technical setbacks would not matter on a less-important work. But treating this film as a \"cheapie knockoff for a fast buck\" angers me.C'mon! Let's see a \"Special Edition\" that remasters this genius in widescreen with all the special features and goodies and technical consideraions properly implemented!\n",
      "Ralphie Rules!However, you might want to wait a few weeks to order, as the Special Edition DVD set is coming in October 2003.  This will be a 2 disc set with an anamorphic widescreen transfer.  Finally!\n",
      "This is really a wonderful work, one that actually grows funnier every time you see it.  No matter how many times this film is shown (and TBS shows it constantly during Christmas), it still resonates and you never get tired of it.  It has a feel of an old time, old Hollywood Christmas story.  There is no foul language (even the old man's obscenities are muffled by the onery furnace), but it isn't an overly sentimental, cheesy film.  Not even close.  It's just an extraordinarily well made film.  All the jokes work, and there isn't a lull in the entire thing.  Every performance is wonderful, from Peter Billingsley to Darren McGavin to Melinda Dillon.  There are so many classic sequences that one has trouble decifering which is the best (mine is \"Chinese turkey\").It's hard to believe that Bob Clark, the man responsible for the raunchy, sleazy Porky's films and the wretched Baby Geniuses film, directed this film, but he did a wonderful job.  It would be a better story if this was the only film he made, but regardless, he deserves every word of praise that comes his way.  And, of course, the source material by Jean Sheperd is so wonderful, which always help immensely.  This is a wonderful film that can be seen at any time....\n",
      "What can I say about a Christmas story?? It's definitely an all time classic. I've seen it a million times and yet it still makes me laugh. Every Christmas I look forward to seeing it on tv.  We've all been there when we were children, wanting that one toy, video game system, CD player, etc.... our main character in this movie is no different.The movie takes place in a small midwestern town in the 1940's.Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wants, more than anything, to own an official Red Rider BB gun. Everyone he asks tells him he's gonna shoot his eye out. His parents, his teacher and even Santa Claus himself. What is a kid to do? We also get to see the everyday trials and tribulations Ralphie goes through, an annoying little brother, the bully at school and the everday battles with his mother (Melinda Dillon) and his father (Darren McGavin, who was probably my favorite character in the movie). Alas, our movie has a happy ending and it is a Christmas Ralphie will never forget.This is a great family movie. It's a really great movie for all ages. We can all relate to what Ralphie goes through, we've all been there, and this type of movie can really bring out the kid in all of us. So if you haven't seen A Christmas Story, may I  suggest you check it out and I'm sure it will be a Christmas family tradition for a long time to come.\n",
      "I watched it recently with my wife and son.  Story is great with some funny moments, and hidden messages about behavior of people during holiday season.\n",
      "Began watching this show when it first came out, after our Thanksgiving dinner, and it's been a tradition ever since.Best memories of the innocence of youth, family and traditions.\n",
      "A Christmas Story is one of those movies that was under appreciated when it was first released but has become a holiday classic.Young Ralphie Parker wishes for nothing but a \"Red Ryder carbine-action, two hundred shot Range Model air rifle with a compass in the stock and this thing which tells time\" (a sundial) for Christmas. But it seems that at every turn, adults are standing between Ralphie and his BB gun with the constant admonition of \"you'll shoot your eye out.\" A Christmas Story recounts the various misadventures of a young boy on a quest for Santa to bring him the best Christmas present ever, while trying to stay out of trouble, staying out of the way of the neighborhood bully, and avoiding the consequences of \"triple dog dares.\"A Christmas Story is narrated by author Jean Shepherd as the adult Ralphie. Shepherd's vivid narration is one of the defining elements of this movie. This movie will entertain the kids and remind adults of their own childhood Christmas stories.A Christmas Story is rated PG for language and some rude humor. Most of the language is self-censored (in scenes where \"the Old Man\" goes into a profanity riddled tirade, the words are all gibberish.) There are only a couple of times that a single obscenity isn't self censored, and even then, it isn't any stronger than anything you would hear on prime-time network television. Overall, A Christmas Story is a great movie to share with the family.\n",
      "Some families make a ritual of watching \"It's A Wonderful Life\" or \"Miracle on 34th Street\" each holiday season.  Not ours; our top choice is this hilarious view of one Christmas season in Ralphie's life, as seen retrospectively by him as an adult.More a series of picaresques in the life of a little boy who wants a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas than a full storyline, it takes us on a journey through childhood, going from the little brother who must be allowed to eat like a pig to eat at all, to the town bullies and their continual harrassment, to the father who wins a \"valuable prize\" one day in a newspaper puzzle contest.  Throughout, Ralphie is plotting ways to still get the gift of his dreams, the Red Ryder--\"you'll shoot your eye out\"-- BB gun.Part of the charm of this film is the narration of Ralphie as an adult looking back on part of his childhood, but it also has many universal themes that are so common to kids, no matter what era.  The bullies, the longing for a seemingly unattainable thing, the playground dares, the constant daydreaming--all these are presented in an entertaining fashion that still causes us to think, \"Yeah, I remember that.\"  Our kids are watching this and saying, \"That is just like when I...\"  This is a wonderful piece of silly escapist nonsense that all members of the family can truly enjoy.\n",
      "Ordered Friday morning, and had it by Saturday morning! It was the fastest order I have ever had, and it included two other bug purchases I had made.\n",
      "It is now a tradition we will watch \"A Christmas Story\" and \"It's A Wonderful Life\" every holiday season. These are the best holiday movies :)\n",
      "enjoy this good flick with your family, it doesn't have any double meaning jokes and is truly a \"G\" movie\n",
      "Just a quick note to \"Jamie\" who hates this movie--how can you possibly recommend that our children watch and subsequently enjoy the R-rated \"Roger and Me\" but thoroughly trash this wonderful  movie?  There's only one cuss word uttered throughout the entire course of  this film, and what person on this planet hasn't been moved to utter  something very similar when faced with the same type of utter  disappointment that Ralphie was? CHILL OUT!Now, on to the main  attraction: this is one gem of a Christmas-time, family-oriented movie!  Perfectly cast and acted, beautifully filmed and expertly representing the  1940's of the Midwest, Jean Shepherd's wonderfully comedic remembrances of  his early Christmas experiences really come to life on the big screen.  Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon are absolutely perfectly cast as the  typical 40's Mom and Dad.  They're spousal jousting is hilarious and a  wonder to behold, yet may ring very true with our own memories of dear old  Mom and Dad, while Peter Billingsly and Ian Petrella fit together really  nicely as the combative/frustrated/competitive siblings.  It's all here,  told in funny, touching and often hilarious ways; the \"I dare  you\" friends, the despair of having the write a \"theme\" in  class, the scarey walk home as you watch for and hopefully miss an  encounter with the neighborhood bully, the wonder and excitement of  listening with rapt attention to the radio programs of the day, and of  course, the tremendous build-up and anxious waiting for \"The Day\"  to arrive!  This fine film will conjure up those wonderful memories of  Christmas when we were kids, no matter what the generation or the decade.  The cheerful, hopeful glee that all children have when it comes to  Christmas-time is so beautifully and hilariously represented here that you  will still be enjoying your favorite moments long after the final credits  have run.  Watch it with your kids later this year as Christmas 2000 draws  near, and as with so many other families, you'll have a new family  tradition by next Christmas--watching this glorious film once again!\n",
      "There is the Christmas depicted in those gorgeously photographed magazines and books.  And there is the Christmas depicted in A Christmas Story.  This is the Christmas that went awry that will always live in your heart as the one with the grin attached.  The life we really lived not the one we saw in the magazine.  You'll love it, you'll watch it every year. The cast is perfect, the story is real. The subplots of the bully, the bb gun, the contest, the Mom and getting Christmas pulled together are beautifully interwoven.  But don't see it continuously as a marathon- the tenderness will get diluted.\n",
      "Another must-have for the Christmas season! Never, ever get tired of it! I can always count on finding items I want on Amazon.com. Thanks to them for making an older couple's shopping easier.\n",
      "I'm sentimental. What can I say? I'm 67 years old, but was always a tom boy. I relate to the older brother, the star, in this movie. I sent for everything you could get from cereal boxes. This movie brings back happy moments from my childhood and it just makes me laugh and laugh. My family loves the movie also. My son was alone for Christmas this year. I bought the movie specifically for him. I wanted him to have a good laugh since he was kind of sad, not being able to spend Christmas with the rest of the family.\n",
      "this wonderful film so reminds me of our family's Christmas long since past. The over heated, over used Christmas lights in one plug unit on the wall... Lights going out, and circuits dead and need to be replaced. Going to the large department store and seeing Santa the night before Christmas. Awh! the memories. This movie is great and I love watching it over and over again.Actors Melinda Dillon, Darren McGavin and Peter Billingsley are great for this story of what a boy wants for Christmas...  A great family film and I highly recommend.\n",
      "This is a great movie, the whole family watched it Christmas Eve. I love the string of Leg lights that came in the tin!! Great conversation piece!! :)\n",
      "I have always liked this film since I saw it when I was in 6th grade....almost 10 years ago.  It's funny.  It relies on actual dialogue and not special effects...so it's obviously for children and adults old and mature enough to have an attention span that doesn't need computer generated effects to keep them from wandering off.  It doesn't glorify owning a gun (gosh, it isn't a semi-automatic weapon, Ralphy is NOT a gang banger!)  He's just a little boy who wants a BB gun. It doesn't promote violence, it promotes children standing up to a bully, and finally, all children who can speak cohearantly KNOW what naughty words are, and that's why they put that in the film.  If people today just aren't teaching their children about life, BB-guns, and that swears are bad...it isn't this movie's fault :) and they could just stick to the cartoon version of the Grinch :)  This film, however, is fun, cute, and you can watch it over and over and over again without getting sick of it :)  It's why TBS has a 24 hour marathon of it ever christmas eve!  It's rewatchability :)\n",
      "FOR RALPHIE ITS ALL ABOUT REACHING HIS GOAL WITHOUT THE USUAL \"YOU'LL SHOOT YOUR EYE OUT NON-SENSE!IN A NUTSHELL:Here we have the ideal young boys Christmas yarn, adapted from a memoir by humorist Jean Shepherd, who narrates throughout the film.FOR RALPHIE ITS ALL ABOUT REACHING HIS GOAL:We have a lofty goal - THE RED RYDER BB GUN under the tree! To reach this goal he must overcome the growing din of naysayers including his teacher and mother who insist: \"YOU'LL SHOOT YOUR EYE OUT!!!!!!To reach that goal we have objectives - giving clues to mom and dad, getting Miss Shields [5th grade teacher] to endorse the idea, and going directly to \"THE MAN\" - SANTA, to enlist his support.BUT THERE IS MORE - MUCH MORE!For starters, we have a ten year old's strange fantasies - having \"BLACK BART\" and his gang all \"pushing up daisies\" after a showdown with cowboy Ralphie and \"Old Blue\" [his Red Ryder].We have a dare that goes from bad to worse as it escalates into a \"Triple Dog Dare\"! What ensues, is simply something that we suggest you don't try at home. That is, unless you want to get your tongue frozen stuck to a pole?We have Bully's and their henchmen. We have really cool narration. Plus, we have Dad and his major award silliness, when he isn't fighting furnace fires, the Buppases dogs and just plain acting uncool in a perfect dad sort of way.Add to that, we have Chinese turkey and christmas themes, flat-tires, a soap poisoning fantasy, a little boy wearing a little girl's pink bunny outfit and the long awaited \"Little Orphan Annie\" decoder set with a letter countersigned by Annie in real ink! We have a little brother, an epiphany over mom and some typical school chums getting into trouble stuff too.There is very nice mood music mostly by Brass Ensemble, when its Christmas, and more fully orchestrated for \"The Grand Canyon Suite\" and other familiar tunes that are appropriate to the period [late 1940s in Northern urban Indiana]BOTTOM LINE:Super-duper entertainment that you can enjoy with the whole family. It never gets tiring and it actually grows on you over time. I first saw \"A Christmas Story\" at the Vero Beach [FLA] Drive-In in 1983, and I have looked forward to seeing it, dozens of times, since.ABOUT THE DVD:I have never seen the 2-Disk set. The single disk, full-screen version I do have is quite an improvement over the VHS version insofar as picture quality is concerned. There are NO FEATURES, and that is of course sad as this type of nostalgic film with child actors really would benefit from that. All in all, this is a great film to have on DVD as it seems to shout - PLAY ME AGAIN!\n",
      "I bought this copy for my grandmother, the special edition just made it that much better. She loves it and will watch it even in the middle of summer. hehe\n",
      "This movie is one of the best of all time.  It is a Christmas tradition in our family, and brings back all the nostalgia of childhood in every aspect.  I challenge you to make it to the end without laughing or crying!\n",
      "This is a good quality movie way clear and of course the best Christmas move I have seen since I was a kid.\n",
      "Great movie and a must have for your holiday movie collection. It's right up there with \"Miracle on 34th Street\" and \"National Lampoons Christmas Vacation\".\n",
      "I recently found out that my mother had not seen A Christmas Story; in fact, she had never heard of it. Granted, we're Jewish, and we never watch TV, but I was still appalled. If somebody were to loudly exclaim 'Ith thtuck! Ith thtuck!', or try to sing a Christmas carol with a heavy Chinese accent, she wouldn't understand the reference! She thought my fanatic insistance that everyone on earth had seen the movie and loved it was a mild exaggeration - until we went to the store to rent the movie, and the clerk kept saying to her as he scanned the barcode: \"C'mon you must have seen it on TV?--At least once?\"So don't imagine your duty is finished once you've seen the movie and enjoyed it. There will not be peace on earth until everyone has experienced this masterpiece of Holiday cinema.\n",
      "What a great deal on this modern classic!  People either love this movie or hate it, so if you are one of the former, buy another copy - sure it's on all day on Christmas, but sometimes you want to watch it on days other than Christmas, and if you don't buy it now for $8.50, then you'll be kicking yourself in July when you have a hankering for some leg lamp action.\n",
      "Showed to the kids for the first time and they loved it.  Thought it might be too dated for them but they still appreciated the story and the humor.\n",
      "TBS has pretty much made a Christmas Eve tradition of watching A Christmas Story. Now that we are strictly streamers, we can still keep the tradition alive. For less than 2 bucks, we were able to stream the movie, not for 24 hours, but 48! Well worth it.\n",
      "Bought this movie as a gift for a family. Safe kid-friendly choice. Timeless movie that can be shared with generations to come.\n",
      "A great story about a kid who wants something very specific... I remember being like that.  Enjoy this Christmas classic.\n",
      "Family favorite for years.  The kids get a kick out of how simple life was back then, and crazy clothes.\n",
      "When A Christmas Story first came out in the early 1980's I saw it three times because I kept dragging friends to view it. I bought a video copy when it came out on VHS; and I bought the DVD version when it came out a few years ago. This current DVD edition is the best yet. Compared to the orginal DVD, which I looked at for the sake of comparison, this 2003 edition has a much clearer image, better color, and a more balanced contrast. Although I have not been able to find any statement verifying my conclusion, I feel strongly the film has been digitally remastered for this special edition. As a result viewing this classic is more of a pleasure and delight than ever. I am very grateful for the fine technical job that Warner Brothers did on this release.\n",
      "This movie is funny no matter how many times I watch it. Every time I watch it as well, I always discover something new.\n",
      "This is such a classic. My mom watches this movie every year, like 100 times. SO I got it as a gag gift.\n",
      "WORTH WATCHING EVERY SINGLE CHRISTMAS!  A GREAT COMMENTARY ON THE XMAS SEASON.  DARREN MC GAVIN IS UNFORGETTABLE.  A MUST FOR THE HOLIDAYS.\n",
      "The film does a fabulous job of capturing Indiana life in that era -- the kids, the situations, the language  -- everything.  I grew up in Indiana just a little later than Shepherd and, while he was in Hammond (Hohman in the film), I was in Bloomington, but it still feels right.  Everyone wanted a Red Ryder bb gun and everyone's parent responded by saying \"You'll shoot your eye out.\"  Everyone knew the consequences of putting your tongue on a frozen pump handle (or flag pole).  And lots of us had neighbors like the Bumpuses and their variety of hounds.  Look, if you want a look at Indiana life from a kid's view at that time in history, you won't find a better source.\n",
      "Fun movie and one that brings back all the memories. A family tradition to watch this film every year. Wonderful!\n",
      "This movie is great for baby boomers or just about anyone.  It deals with universal themes such as  growing up, sibling positioning, bullies and dealing with them, belief in Santa, coming of age, honesty, responding to \"dares\". Very cute\n",
      "This movie is hilarious, its a must see for all family's especially during the winter no matter what age you are you will relate one way or another from the stressed out parents or the bullies at school and overcoming them to sticking your tongue on the frozen pole even though we all were told not to lol, all the way to that one gift that you have to keep and pretend to like because some crazy relative gave it to you. even though your like \"wait , what is this  nooooooo \" too funny and family orientated!\n",
      "what can you say traditional classic. I is becoming traditional for us to view this movie every Christmas. Love the fact that I can now stream it.\n",
      "The most unsual christmas story, set on the USA of 50's that tells the struggle of a little boy and his Santa Claus gift desire within a mildly disfuntional family, it sure looks like something that cannot be understood or appreciate it by a contemporary foreign father and son... think again, this movie is able to go compare to the classics and it is indeed one of them.I always watched this movie started when it was shown here in Venezuela in the early 90s in the public state tv (nowdays it would be impossible, with the communist anti-american regime that has seized power, foreign christmas ideas as the tree and santa claus are labelled \"imperialistic transculturization\")and I can only say that I was always amazed. The translation in spanish is so perfect that it helps me put some of the description in a proper context when I see it in english.The setting, the acting, the production and the story is mastefully orchestrated creating indeleble scenes that will always live in our memories. My son and I have always a good time remembering the scenes and the expressions from this movie, that I sure it will stregthen your codes and memories with your loved ones as well.I will have to say that the story is a bit acid and some of the parental punishments that I lived such as \"washing your mouth with soap\" are seldom seen today,  proper appreciation might can be expected with more age, yet I have seen that kids also enjoy this trip down a nostalgic era that neither them or I lived. When we showed it to my dad, his eyes glowed when he saw the \"Red Ryder rifle\".When I was a kid the \"Wizard of Oz\" was the movie per exellance- now kids do not even know that exists- so when our heroe sees his mother and school teacher turn (in his imagination) to the wicked-witch-of-the-west we can appreciate how well this scene fits in the overall setting of the movie.I will give anything away, for many reviewers have done that and each of us have a favorite scene. We can all relate to our little hero on his plight to make ask Santa the red ryder bb gun rifle, though I think many of us never lived to have a the store santa stepping on our face to slide us off down the north pole tobogan. I would say this is the perfect classic for parents who will also understand perfectly the oddities and affection mom and dad display through out the movie.If your kids are too small I am not sure it will be appreciated, this is a tale told by the narrator (who is remebering his childhood) in a very erudite manner, which is also part of what makes it enjoyable since it constrast with the simplicity of the kid, we can appreciate that but a small kid...I have laughed very much reading other reviewers comments that this forum has indeed made the movie more enjoyable, specially the comments made to that reviewer who only gave it a 1 star!!\n",
      "the grandkids slept over at christmas time and this DVD went over \"bigtime\" before they went to sleep for the night with anticipation for the following morning.  the BB gun theme was perfect to hang all the excitement of the season on.....i know because i had the same wish over 60 years ago when my family moved from the city to a dairy farm in wisconsin and got a Red Ryder that first christmas.  it's a timeless presentation....sure to please during the holiday season.  highly recommended.  pk\n",
      "Fun facts and interviews from the cast in the second disc were worth while.  I have an earlier version of the movie and received this one as a stocking stuffer this year.  If you are interested in buying \"A Christimas Story\", this two-disc special edition is the 'must have' version.  If you already have the movie without the extras, you will still need this two-disc edition.\n",
      "This movie never gets old....it is one of our holiday traditions.  The DVD version doesn't have any great special features, but I wasn't expecting it from a movie filmed that long ago.\n",
      "For a Christmas treat, my seventh grade teacher played this for our class and it was the fist time I ever watched it. It's basically about this little boy with glasses, imaginative scenarios, funny commentary, and the hope of a new BB gun for Christmas. Just to let you guys know, even if the grown-ups say \"You'll shoot your eye out!\", it wasn't a HUGE deal like it is today. I thought the story was pretty good, and the family and the mini-adventures they get into are hilarious. It has a nostalgic feel to it even if you werent around during that time period. I really liked it!\n",
      "This is a great movie for people of all ages, even though this movie took place many years ago, 1940's setting, I think kids will enjoy this. The tale of any child's Christmas dreams is universal. Great fun, but be careful, you'll shoot your eye out.\n",
      "What a clever little tale! I had not seen this until Chridtmas 2013, and was likely the last American to see it! It is a Christmas keeper. The narration is really comical, and al the actors do a terrific job.\n",
      "What can you say, it's a classic. My wife is from NW Indiana (The Region) where this is supposed to take place. Got tired of waiting for cable to show it.\n",
      "Summary: This is the story of Ralphie Parker and his season-long quest to receive a Red Ryder BB Gun for Christmas. The ensuing shenanigans with Ralphie at home and at school serves as a reminder of how endearing family can be during the holidays, no matter how weird the parts of the family are.What About It: No Christmas movie list is ever complete without this movie. Although it is realistically a generational movie for the children of the baby boomers, its charm carries on through the generations.Who doesn't remember a gift you really wanted that no one wanted to buy for you, or motherly love that turned you into a turtle on its back in the snow, or those weird footsy pajamas or ugly sweater that a relative gave you that your parents forced you to wear? Do you remember when your dad first heard you curse? How many kids wondered about their tongue sticking to a pole, just because no one had ever tried it? I remember all of that, and this movie serves as a reminder as to why I can laugh at the humiliation  and anger I had in those days.But it's a nice group of holiday memories, and through the casting and directing of this movie,we are brought into a wonderful film of nostalgia that the whole family can enjoy.\n",
      "This is one of the nicest and funniest Christmas movies I have every seen. The lamp \"incident\" is great and so is the turkey \"incident\".\n",
      "With all of the fondness I've read for this movie I was surprised that it's mainly an American thing. I've never seen A Christmas Story on TV or in stores in the UK. I doubt many people outside of the US know who Jean Shepherd is, or of his popular Ralphie Parker character. In fact, most people in general won't know that this movie is actually the fourth of (currently) seven featuring Ralphie.Adapted from the book In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash, a collection of mostly Christmas-themed short stories, it remind me a lot of Christmas Vacation (adapted by John Hughes from his own Christmas '59 short story) in that it seems semi-autobiographic. But the adaptation of several stories gives the movie a sketchy feel, with a few that failed to resonate with me.The main story has little Ralphie Parker (brilliantly played by Peter Billingsly), a kid with imagination and cynicism beyond his years, beg his parents, and Santa, for a BB gun while dealing with a series of eccentric events in 1940s Indiana. It made me laugh quite a lot, but mainly in the second half. The cosy Xmas atmosphere is lovely, and there's not a shred of anything unwholesome. But I just can't see myself making this an annual tradition.I am sure many will disagree, but it does make me curious about checking out the other Ralphie Parker movies.The Blu-ray features a fine 1.78:1 1080p picture which accurately exhibits the film's retro color pallet and style. The sound is non-HD Dolby Mono, but it too matches the period setting. There are plenty of decent extras too. This Collector's Edition comes in a big tin box with a string of Xmas lights inside. The DVD counterpart contained an apron, cookie cutters, and a 50-page recipe book. I would much rather have had that than Xmas lights.\n",
      "What can I say? This is a classic, Everyone should see I watch it every Christmas with my family, it is always a fun time.\n",
      "Good for the whole family. A Christmas Story returns you to the charged emotional state of being a kid on around Christmas while also showering the parents perspective. Hilarious and heartwarming.\n",
      "It's a good laugh which is what we need this hectic time of year.A lot of it is things our parents said to us when we were young.\n",
      "Since I was a boy about the time this movie takes place, I can really relate to this kid.  It is a fun Christmas movie!\n",
      "I purchased this as a \"secret santa\" gift exchange present.  This was the hit of the party and was the first gift to get \"locked down\".  The box is made of metal and the art work on it is nice, in a goofy sort of way.  If you are a fan of \"A Christmas Story\", this would be a nice addition to your holiday collection.\n",
      "How can anyone not have this film in their collection. It is to me one of the best Christmas stories of the 20th century, rivaling \"White Christmas\", \"The Miracle on 34th Street\" and even \"It's a Wonderful Life\". It is in a class all to itself and is worth watching over and over.\n",
      "I've heard so much about A CHRISTMAS STORY through the years that I knew it was time to see this film. I've seen the Christmas items--the Leg Lamp and Ralphie dressed as a bunny so now it was time to see what it all meant.A plus to me was having Darren McGavin as the father. McGavin has been a favorite actor of mine since the KOLCHAK TV series.A CHRISTMAS STORY seemed to be off to a slow start author Jean Shepherd's narration was a bit annoying at first. It reminded me of THE WALTONS. But quickly, the pieces fell into place and it was evident as to what a delightful heartwarming film this is and why it should be an annual Christmas tradition for anyone.The Parker family is a quirky but loveable bunch. Darren McGavin stars as the father or \"the old man\" as he is affectionately called. Melinda Dillon is the mother. The old man seems quite a bit older than mother. Ralphie is the older son and Randy is the \"baby\" of the family.This Christmas season, Ralphie is obsessed with getting a Red Ryder B.B. gun from Santa and it is his goal to make it happen. The constant \"You'll shoot your eye out\" doesn't deter him in his quest.Here is a very sweet return to a kinder and gentler time when Christmas was a magical event filled with Santa Claus and holiday cheer. We didn't take ourselves so seriously in the 1940's. Adults who grew up in the 40's - 60's might relate to these special Christmases involving Santa at the Department Store and finding the \"perfect\" live Christmas tree.\"The old man\" comes across as a bit of a curmudgeon but underneath he is a softie who loves his wife and sons. It was an era when the man had to seem tough and he ruled the house, or so he thought. Mother was the glue that held everyone together and she could soothe both husband and sons. The Parkers were a more realistic version of the perfect family.Ian Petrella as Randy, the younger brother, is a real scene stealer as the kid who idolizes his older brother. As the \"baby\", he is bundled up to look like the Stay Puft Marshmallow man barely able to move or keep up with his brother and friends on their way to school. Every day, they are chased by the local bullies and every day they take the same route to school to pass the bullies. Yep, there were bullies even back then.This film is filled with so many memorable moments. How about the leg lamp or the tongue frozen to a pole? What about a ruined Christmas dinner being saved by a meal in a Chinese restaurant. Maybe the Chinese staff trying to sing FLA LA LA LA LA becoming fra ra ra ra ra would be politically incorrect today but there is a sweetness to the scene. The staff is trying its best to make a happy and memorable Christmas for the disappointed family and guess what, they save Christmas for the Parker Family.A CHRISTMAS STORY is so sweet and so gentle on so many levels. If only, we could take a step back into time when Christmas had a meaning and families were together.\n",
      "I love this movie. Haven't seen it in years, but loved watching it on the widescreen. This Blu-ray is pretty clear considering how old it is. I was afraid it would be really grainy, but it's pretty good. The disk includes some special features too. I highly recommend it!\n",
      "What can I say about this movie?  Everyone has probably seen it and most everyone loves it.  TV channels feature it every Christmas season and adults as well as kids look forward to watching it again.It's lots of fun and so much of it rings true with anyone who has gone through all the twists and turns of childhood.\n",
      "I love A Christmas Story. I watch A Christmas Story on X-mas Eve and X-Mas day. Ralphie was my favorite in a X-Mas Story.\n",
      "...even if you AREN'T over 60!  A classic movie that shows Christmas in a Golden Age.  Reminds me of my own childhood\n",
      "Such a great Christmas classic. How could you not like this story? Used to think the \"bully\" was funny, but no longer think it's appropriate for today's children!!\n",
      "A new family tradition is watching this movie. This is excellent, glad I bought it. A great addition to our holiday library.\n",
      "I have really enjoyed watching this many times this season.  It is great for the whole family and arrived in good condtion.\n",
      "The Blu-ray disc is a real treat that preserves this holiday gem in all its nostalgic glory. Even Raphie's father would have liked it!\n",
      "I always loved the movie and I'm so happy to now have it on Blue Ray where my family can have a more vivid viewing.\n",
      "The story is great in every way!! It brings back memories thought I had long forgotten.  My whole family from 82 to 9 years of age agree.\n",
      "Have watched this more times than I care to recount.I see me in Ralphie, in almost every scene, except I was in parochial school.I've tasted Ivory soap, prayed for a Red Ryder BB gun, fought a kid that I thot was tuff, etc, etc, etc,... ad infinitum.The mom & dad roles are as I remember much of my childhood, as well....even though, for 37 months, I was a POW with mom & dad, during WWII.This movie constantly reminds me of mom, dad, me and my sister.... and I love every moment of it and never tire of watching it.It is way too funny and I've learned to laugh at life, as taught me by my tough, Irish mom.!!\n",
      "Since moving to Nashville and Christmas approaching, I asked my new co workers if they were going to watch A Christmas Story. Most didn't know what movie I was talking about. Shocking to this Detroit girl. Then I heard that my boss was buying  his young son a BB gun for Christmas and I knew they had to see this movie. My search took me to all the usual stores, Target, Walmart and even the Kroger video department. Nothing. Thank god for Amazon. Ordered it and it arrived in a timely fashion. My boss said his son watched the movie three times in one day. The BB gun as would be expected was his favorite gift.\n",
      "The family gets together each Christmas to watch this classic film.  The comedy gets better each year!  Baby Boomers will love it!\n",
      "\" A Christmas Story \" is the BEST Christmas comedy  with a message to tell EVER made Second only to National Lampon's Christmas Vacation !!\n",
      "Crazy very funny movie for those enjoying their memories of a more secular Christmas!  Just plain fun! I love it!\n",
      "An all time favorite. The whole family gets to enjoy this every year. The 2 disk set is the one to get.\n",
      "I have always fhought about my own childhood while viewing this movie. Somehow they really did invent video recording back in the early 1950's and somehow hid the cameras while taping me. I did what what I thought best to those masked muraders and Black Bart. Good thing I had Old Blue to help with that chore.........\n",
      "great movie a classic everybody should own a copie of movie and watch it with their family around christmas time .\n",
      "No Christmas is complete without watching \"A Christmas Story\" several times.  Instead of watching commercials with TBS' marathon on Christmas day, just put this in and play it over and over...  It's a good quality DVD and the movie is a family favorite...\n",
      "This movie stands the test of time.  I saw it twice in the movie theater.  I had the VCR.  Now i have the DVD.  A great cast, all thechildren did brilliant acting.  This was Jean Shepherd's most famous movie (if you can find any of his other movies, i highly recommend them).\n",
      "Decorating Christmas cookies with out watching this movie just cannot happen!  So funny and I love it!!!\n",
      "Sharing with the family. Always enjoy this movie. Giving to all the families this year so they have  their own copy.\n",
      "We can't make it through the holidays without watching A Christmas Story once or twice...it's a modern classic.  Gene Shepherd was a sublimely funny story teller and his talent lives on in the movie version of his wonderful musings.\n",
      "We watch this movie all year long. There's just nothing better!!! There are so many quotable moments that seem to make their way into our daily lives and now that I'm a parent I get great use out of the line, \"You'll shoot your eye out!\" I'd give this movie a hundred stars if I could!\n",
      "My favorite Christmas story.  It's just not Christmas until I've seen A Christmas Story,  I could watch it over and over.  LOVE IT !\n",
      "It was old school funny and so much the way things used to be.Not the beaver cleaver perfect family.I liked it.\n",
      "Peter Billingsley and his family are not just figments of Jean Shephard's imagination.  They are real; they are understanding, kind, vulnerable, and very funny. This is one of our favorite videos--for all seasons. Told by a  master story teller.\n",
      "Good classic kids movie. No violence swearing murders.  Just good clean fun for all the family.this is a must. Ok\n",
      "We have loved this movie for years.  We now own it and will be able to watch it any time we want.  It is a great addition to our Christmas movie collection.\n",
      "l love this movie but haven't had a chance to play it yet so not sure this would be a good review of the product itself.\n",
      "I purchased this as a gift and know the receiver will love it.  It's a heartwarming story for all ages.\n",
      "I liked this movie because it reminds me of when I was at that age and wanting a special present (Chrisy Doll) for Christmas.\n",
      "Great movie! thank you\n",
      "What can I say it is a Classic.... One of the best Christmas Films of all time. I recommend it!\n",
      "This classic makes for memories. Who could forget the boy getting his mouth washed out with soap for using profanity, or his delight upon getting a Daisy BB gun for Christmas? Who could forget the scene where he beats the tar out of a bully? Or the scene where he fantasizes being a prima donna in front of his class? And who could overlook the distinctive lady-leg lamp, and the neighborhood spectacle it created? Funny!\n",
      "This is a must-see movie for any Christmas fan. A cult classic for sure, seeing this film was a rite of passage for me and my friends when we were younger.\n",
      "Great movie for a family holiday movie night. Full of laughs and life lessons, good for all ages to see.\n",
      "One of the best Christmas films ever and a greaft film in its own right. The only disadvantage to this DVD is that it does not take advantage of the widescreen capabilities that almost all DVDs offer us. Thus I am forced to give this DVD a 4 instead of a 5\n",
      "There is no doubt that this is the best Christmas movie to ever make it to the big screen. All of te nostalgic elements combine to make a truly wonderful experience. Definately a must have for the holidays.\n",
      "The Christmas season would not be the same without A Christmas Story at our house! Love, love, love it! A MUST FOR EVERY FAMILY\n",
      "This one has all the classic nostalgia around Christmas accompanied by clever narration. A must see for a old time holiday feel with some great laughs. The disc and cover were like new as advertised and ran without a hitch.\n",
      "Old memories are attached with this movie--my sister and I were delighted to share it with her children (ages 12, 14 and 15). A lot of holiday fun.\n",
      "This would have to be my favorite Christmas movie by a long shot. It just has such a wholesome yet hilarious quailty surrounding it. What other movie could they show for 24 hours straight? The characters fit their roles so well. I think Darren Mcgavin plays one of the funniest most memorable characters in the history of cinema. If you haven't seen \" A Christmas Story,\" which would be very hard to believe, then do yourself a favor and pick it up.\n",
      "I have fond memories of this movie. I first watched it when I was Ralphie's age, and have watched it around Christmas every year since. What's not to like? You have a kid wanting a Red Ryder BB Gun more than anything else, and having to convince all the adults around him that he won't \"shoot his eye out.\" Along the way, he has to deal with the local bullies, the \"bumperson hounds,\" his younger brother, disillusionment with Little Orphan Annie, and the trials and tribulations of life as a young boy in general.What else can I say? Aside from \"A Christmas Carol,\" this is probably the best and well-liked Christmas movie out there. An enjoyable treat for young and old!\n",
      "It is the best of the best for Christmas and great all through the entire year.  Would recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "I love this movie!  I have to watch it every year, if I can.  I had to rent it last Christmas since I could never find the time to watch it on TV.\n",
      "I first saw this film with a friend at the age of 14.  The next day, I convinced my father to go and see it- which was no easy feat and the only time I've ever been to a theater with him.  He then saw it for a second time the following night with his mother.  All of us enjoyed this movie.  Every year we catch part of it on television and we all laugh like we've never seen it before.  It's right up there with all of the other Christmas classics!  A must see.\n",
      "Every Christmas \"A Christmas Carol\" is shown as tradition, but another film may join it, \"A Christmas Story.\"  This delightful film about a boy (Billingsley) who tries his best to get his parents to buy him a BB gun for Christmas.  As told from a child's point of view, we see his family life and his adventures in school, up until the point where he wakes up Christmas morning to see if his wish came true.  Melinda Dillon plays a great mother and Darren McGavin does a wonderful job as the dad. I would recommed this fil to anyone who likes to sit down during the Christmas season and watch Christmas movies.  Watching this has become a tradition for my family.\n",
      "It's not Christmas without watching Ralphie Parker dreaming of the Red Rider BB gun! In the 2nd one, the boys are all teenagers, planning on getting their drivers' licenses & with their eyes on 'cars' (aka junk mobiles that need a lot of work, but they're cheap to buy). Ralphie (yes, he is still called that at times!) also has a major crush on the star quarterback's girlfiend (watch out, here come the dream sequences). In order to earn money (not going to say why; don't want to give it all away), Ralph & Co. get jobs at--where else--HIGBY'S DEPARTMENT STORE! Yes, the same place where Santa pushed Ralphie down the slide with his boot & yes, at some point, the guys become Santa's elves. Fun movie to watch (the Old Man is still dealing with the blasted furnace) & has a great surprise ending, but as usual, the original is better than the first. For those who want more of 'Ralphie,' there is a summer vacation version with Charles Grodin as 'The Old Man' & Mary Steenburgen as he mother. The movie is \"My Summer Story.\" It's set after the original 'A Christmas Story' & can be a fun diversion. I recommend this double edition set, plus \"My Summer Story.\" For all Peter Billingsley fans, he is also a producer & director as well as an actor now. He played the elf checking on how many Etch-A-Sketch toys that Buddy made in \"Elf.\" He is also the airline ticket agent at the who tells Vince Vaughn's & Reese Witherspoon's characters that their flight to Australia/New Zealand is grounded (& there are no other flights available) in \"Four Christmases.\" Very talented man!!\n",
      "This was a Christmas gift for mom and she couldn't be happier. The DVD & packaging is great and you cant go wrong with this classic movie. Nostalgic and awesome! Recommended\n",
      "Now I have this Christmas classic in my collection. It brings back happy memories of the first year I saw it when my son was 8 years old.\n",
      "Been hearing for years this was a must see movie.  Finally watched it and agree.  Good, wholesome entertainment for the entire family.\n",
      "Timeless movie that always garners chuckles during Christmas time. Ralphie's quest for a shotgun is hilarious and his father is a hoot. You'll enjoy this movie.\n",
      "Got this for the family--we enjoyed watching it.  It is a fun Christmastime favorite!  The film actually has a lot of satire--in an entertaining way.  The extra features are nice, but not the focus.\n",
      "For anyone looking for some classic holiday enjoyment, A Christmas Story is the epitomy of the traditional Christmas.  Told from the point of view of young boy Ralphie, the story covers his desperate longing for the mother of all Xmas gifts, the Red Rider carbine action single shot air rifle.As with any special edition DVD, there are a ton of extras.  Some enjoy them; I am only interested in the movie itself.Anytime one is in the mood for some good family entertainment A Christmas Story delivers the humor, realism, and trials of a classic Xmas tale.\n",
      "This DVD will be a Christmas classic for years to come. It depicts the 1940's to perfection, right down to the porridge served up by Mom. This is a timeless depiction of a kid's ultimately fulfilled wish for that special  gift at Christmas. His parents, brother and other characters are hilarious.  Several of the scenes such as the unplanned Christmas dinner at the Chinese  restaurant are belly aching, tear producing fun. The final scene with the  lighted tree and heavy snow falling with a period Christmas carol in the  background is how we fondly remember Christmas at home. Come on Jamie,  loosen up and enjoy!\n",
      "Christmas Classic!  I have always loved this movie and I just ordered one from Amazon to replaced a lost copy so I don't have to wait for it to come on TV.\n",
      "Ralphie... a man before his time. A victim of BB gun \"gun control.\" Harrassed by bullies, disillusioned by Little Orphan Annie products... Ralphie is maturing despite himself.The funniest scenes involve the stuffed stiff little brother, whose winter garb made him \"look like a tick about to pop.\"  I thought my mother was the only over-protective winter alarmist!!Even small, unimportant moments make me laugh... such as when a \"Wizard of Oz\" style witch garbed woman is working the crowd lined up to see Santa starts bothering poor Ralphie, and calls him a \"tasty little morsel.\" Ralphie, obsessed with soliciting the big red guy for his Holy Grail of Christmas Presents, responds...\"Uh... leave me alone... I'm, uh... THINKING.\"Ralphie articulates what all kids feel, he daydreams almost as much as I used to.Some forgivable weaknesses in this film is an over-used soundtrack, \"cluing us in\" as to when we're supposed to laugh... it's repetative music just gets in the way of the humor!Another forgivable flaw is how the movie is actually a series of events, loosely strung together by it's \"anecdote master\" writer. Still, that's how real life is... not every daily occurance is tied in to the next.The odd style profanity depictions of the father also takes some getting used to... \"glabber-puss, humbuckle dash-heimer!!\"  We're supposed to imagine the actual terms... which are more commonly heard on television these days than in the movies in the 80s.Ralphie represents the childhood experiences most of us have had... whenever they grew up. It's timeless nostalgia!The DVD extra features serve us well enough, considering the fact that this movie was considered a theatrical \"flop\" of the mid 80s. It's been a mega-force Holiday tradition in the years proceeding!Jeff Messenger, author of the novel \"the Shroud of Torrington.\"\n",
      "AAA+++, Love the movie, great blu ray quality and leg lamps are hung and look great.\n",
      "This is a CLASSIC, but today I am sure there are liberal mom & dads that frown on this plot, but all I remember is my youth and at the young age I received my first BB gun.  At first my parents did not want me to have it, but after begging and promising the sun they let me have it and WOW did I have fun.  I was always safe and responsible and NEVER abused the BB gun.  What a great teaching tool for the typical american boy.  Thank you mom and dad!\n",
      "I have watched this movie in excess of 20 times.  It never gets old.  Even though I grew up in the 80's, this movie hearkens back to a sweeter, simpler time.  A must see for the holiday season.\n",
      "The wonderful Jean Shepherd perfectly captures the kind of irrational working-class American adult world in which many my age (60) grew up.  Of course, the movie also provides wonderful insights into how kids dealt with that world and its assumptions.  How did we ever survive to rational adulthood?  (I'm afraid many didn't.)\n",
      "Shooting your eye out was never so much fun. Amazon made this a memorable Christmas for our family.  Great quality for a great price\n",
      "Great product. Just what I expected. Delivered as expected.I would recommend this to my friends.  I liked it. Thanks,\n",
      "Well acted and accurately captured many themes for those of us who are \"baby boomers.\" Predictable at times. Thoroughly enjoyed the Christmas themes.\n",
      "I love this movie. Ralphie is so funny. This video is a classic family film to watch at Christmas time. I have the movie on VHS, but I hope to get the DVD before the Christmas season. This movie is the type that should become a Christmas tradition, it is unforgetable. So if you haven't seen \"A Christmas Story\" then go and rent it from your local video store. Your local Blockbuster should have this movie.\n",
      "\"No, I promise you, Daddy is not going to kill Ralphie.\"One of the many exchanges in this film that makes me laugh every time. \"Christmas Story\" is a movie that always gives me the warm fuzzies. What could have been just another story of childhood is enhanced by Ralphie's vivid imagination (the dream sequences are hilarious) and Jean Shepherd's amusing narration. A classic to be treasured.\n",
      "I was pleased with my purchase of the video, A Christmas Story (Full-Screen Edition), that I purchased from Amazon. It arrived in plenty of time for christmas. My grandchildren loved it. I have purchased other items from Amazon. I have been satisfied with the way Amazon conducts business, they are prompt to respond to any questions you may have and resolve any problems should they arise.\n",
      "Everyone needs this movie.  It's so good and always puts me in the Christmas spirit.  It never gets out-dated, a perfect film.\n",
      "Movie came quickly and it's a great movie to watch during the holiday season! Will try and buy more movies from Amazon!\n",
      "Is there a babyboomer out there that doesn't have a personal memory (or several) of the hilarious events of this film?  I first saw this movie on TV about ten years ago and the story seemed so familiar it became an instant favorite.  I was delighted with the DVD version I'd purchased as a gift to my immediate family.  Ralphie and his family will win your heart time after time.  Take a trip down this nostalgic memory lane again and again.\n",
      "Seriously, can you really rate this bad?  This is a classic and I'm sure if you're buying it, you know what you're buying.\n",
      "This is by far a new Christmas classic! A definite favorite.\n",
      "\"Fragile...must be Italian!\"  So many classic lines from this movie and I love to repeat them all! This is a great version of the movie (assuming you don't have a BluRay) which some fun bonus features.\n",
      "This movie is one of my favorites. I laugh a lot as I remember my own childhood Christmases. I enjoy the slower pace of the film; not like the super fast-paced modern stuff that makes me not want to go to the movies anymore. Just a good, fun movie.\n",
      "There are very few movies which I can honestly say qualify as my \"favorites.\" Even fewer among Christmas-themed movies. But \"A Christmas Story\" is certainly one of them.Why? Because I laughed as much watching it the 23rd time as I did the first. Because I can watch it every year and never get sick of it. Because I enjoy it as much now as I did as a kid (although for different reasons).The genius of this movie is its simple, heartfelt story and loveable characters. Every character seems to remind you of people you really know. You can relate to them and the story they're living. Who doesn't remember wishing and begging for that one must-have present?! And how exciting it was to open it up and see that you *actually* got it?!Who doesn't have parents who do things that are more-than-slightly embarrassing? Or whom you admired and feared at the same time as a kid? Or have a pesky brother, sister, cousin, or would-be friend who just wouldn't leave you alone? Or ever get pushed around by the school bully? (Unless you were the school bully, that is.)This movie is superb in that it appeals to all audiences. There is no violence, no blood-and-guts, no tragedy or trauma. There isn't even foul language -- although you'd think so with all the huffing-and-puffing the Old Man does. If you listen carefully, you'll notice that not one swear word is used in this movie -- only words that *sound* like swear words. Example: When the Old Man gets mad at Mother for \"accidentally\" breaking his Major Award and then \"using up all the glue\" -- he shouts \"Nottafingga!!\" Not really a word, is it?! But it sure sounded pretty bad!Over the years I have grown fond of the movie's characters, and I look forward to watching it every year and \"visiting\" with Ralphie, Randy, Mother, the Old Man -- even nasty Scut Farcus!! I think it would be difficult for you not the feel the same way about this movie.\n",
      "Every moment of A Christmas Story is Packed with great comedy.  It is also sweet and heartwarming at times. No matter how many times you see it you love it; not just at Christmas but any time of year.  This speacial edition DVD has lots of fun extras that any fan of the movie would treasure.Jennifer K. LaffertyAuthor of Offbeat Love Stories and More\n",
      "I can't believe this movie has been around almost as long as I have! It's a Christmas classic that we watch every year. And yes I watch it on TBS at least once during the 24-hour marathon.The DVD and the features are pretty ho-hum, but whether you guy the special edition or the regular DVD, just buy the movie! I just convinced my fiance to watch it and he even he liked it!\n",
      "bought because my husband loves this movie. every year he watches it during the 24 hour of a christmas story & watches as many times as he can.\n",
      "The first time I watched this movie was at the age of ten and I love it ever since. Ralphie and his obsession with a Red Ryder BB gun is an annual classic. I think that everyone can relate to Ralphie's Old Man and his mother. Randy the little brother is adorable too. I watch this movie every year during the holidays. I laugh ever time I watch it. I think that everybody should have this movie it makes a very good Christmas present.Set in the 40s, for those who grow up in the 60s could easily identify with the themes of \"A Christmas Story\". Contains great lessons for any rambunctious youngsters contemplating sticking their tongues to flagpoles in the dead of winter or playing around with BB guns.  Absolutely PRICELESS and a must-have for holiday video collectors. You will laugh yourself senseless.\n",
      "I can't imagine there's someone out there who hasn't seen this movie, but if you haven't, you've been missing out. It's a classic and we're glad we own it so now we can watch it every year. (We don't have tv, so no 24-hour marathon for us.)\n",
      "Oh, come on, who doesn’t like this movie?  Yes, it’s on various cable channels a zillion times in December, but there’s something very satisfying about watching it in its entirety and without the annoying commercial interruptions.\n",
      "This is a classic movie and I love it. Also the HD version is very crisp. I was pleasantly surprised.\n",
      "Its really funny and the disk was bwtter then i expected over all i give this a solid 4 stars\n",
      "A holiday must-have in my house.  Wouldn't be Christmas without it.  Now we can watch this without all the commercials.\n",
      "What can I say about the best Christmas movie ever? You can't go wrong with this one. If you have an 8-10 year old boy in the house, get it. If you have a neighbor with smelly old dogs, get it. If you are a bully, get it! This movie is great for the whole family and it has been a part of mine for many years now on tired old VHS tape and now the DVD will last forever!\n",
      "It is a little silly. It was recommended. My family liked it. They are immigrants. Well worth the low cost.\n",
      "This is by far the best family Christmas movie ever made.  There are plenty of fine holiday movies, and I like most of them, but this one has a special place in my heart.  It is fun, and really quite humorous.  The late  Jean Shepherd wrote a masterpiece in this movie, and he was excellent as  the narrator -- reminiscent of The Waltons, only funny.  It's a holiday  classic that should be in the video library of every family.  To listen to  sound clips from this movie, go to wilstar.com/xmas.\n",
      "Had to show this movie to the new generation of children in my family. Kids these days need to realize how life was in those times.\n",
      "The title says it all.  Anyone who doesn't already know the story of Ralphie and his quest for the Red Ryder Christmas gift should watch this movie at least once in their lifetime.\n",
      "My husband loves this movie and will watch at Christmas when it is on for 24 hours - now he can watch anytime\n",
      "\"A Christmas Story\" is colorful, theatrical, musical, family-centric and meaningful and incredibly funny. This has always been my very favorite Christmas movie. As you may know there are about a zillion different \"A Christmas Story\" movie releases so although this review is about the movie, I will also be detailing the 2-disc DVD set that came out in 2003.I have fond memories of seeing \"A Christmas Story\" when it was still in the movies as a very young child. But this is the type of movie that everyone will love, it's not a movie just for children. The entire family will appreciate it.The story centers around Ralph Parker (Peter Billingsley) who longs for nothing more than a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas. Ralph will stop at noting to get his Christmas-fix. Although the children in the movie were all very talented and funny, I think I liked the parents the most.The father is played by the late and much-loved Darren McGavin and the mom is portrayed by Melinda Dillon. I love the parents because everyone has parents like them. Mr. Parker always came home angry at the world, but just as angry and caustic as he was, that's how kind and loving Mrs. Parker was. I also loved the character of Randy (Ian Petrella) because he had to be at least 8 or 9, yet he was still being treated like a 2-year-old. That's classic and so hysterical.The coup de grce has gotta be when Ralph goes buck-wild on Scut Farkus (Zack Ward). He just snapped and manages to get on top of the resident bully and just starts pummeling him with b-slaps, causing Farkus to start crying. I also love the part when Ralphie is forced to wear that hideous pink rabbit costume that his aunt sent him for Christmas. Because what child cannot relate to something similar happening; although I am sure nothing is as ludicruis as Ralph's bunny suit.Although the movie is shown during a 24-hour marathon every year I cannot think of a single reason why everyone should not own it. But, there are so many different releases, so it may be a little confusing to know which to choose. I prefer the 2-disc 2003 special edition set. Because it didn't cost much (that's most important and yes these are used but I couldn't care less) and because the packaging is great, it's looks like a Christmas gift (see the scans that I took the time to label and post) and it includes lots of bonuses and interviews. The 2003 2-disc set includes \"A Christmas Story\" in both pan and scan and letterbox, and the movie is remastered; making it appear just as fantastic as it sounds.If you're like me you will watch \"A Christmas Story\" over and over again during Christmastime because it's the perfect movie to welcome in the most joyous time of the year. Repeat the sounding joy.\n",
      "If you have a blu-ray player and you love this movie... this should be on your collection... it also have a tree lights shaped as the infamous leg lamp... i highly recommend it\n",
      "My boyfriend loves this movie so I decided to get it for him for Xmas, he was stoked to see it in his stocking on Xmas morning! only crazy part is we watched it about 3x that day but he's happy so I'm happy! Thank you!\n",
      "A must see every year, if nothing more than to see Ralphie in his bunny suit and profanity ridden fight with the bully.\n",
      "You've seen it more times than you can count, you love it, and now it's time to get A Christmas Story on HD DVD.  A great movie just got even better by going HD.  Picture and sound quality are great and this is a must have for your holiday movie collection.\n",
      "i GOT IT THATS ALL I CAN REMEMBER IN 4 YEARS BACK I AM COSING OUT THIS AMAZON ACCOUNT DUE TO MY MOM IS NO LONGER WITH US SO THEY WEE SUPPOSE TO CLOSE IT BUT AS YOU SEE DID NOT AND I AM JUST TRYING TO BE NICE AND GIVE OUT WHAT PEOPLE DESERVE.

NICE OF THEM RIGHT NOW WHAT DO YOU TELL A CHILD HAT HE DINT GET A KINDLE....THEY DON'T ANSWER THERE IN THE PHILIPENSE SO THEY HAVE TO MAIL TO THE STATES THE PROBLEMS.....\n",
      "My husband & I have watched this movie dozens of times over the years & it's definately our favorite Christmas movie.  It's hard to believe it was made in 1984 because the costumes, settings, automobiles,  everything, is so well done that your sure you're in 1940's mid-west  America.  It's simply a classic---not to be missed!\n",
      "This movie is good for all generations, kids to adults. It doesn't even appear that dated since it's such a well-done movie. Love it every year.\n",
      "I had and old VHS tape and upgraded to Blu-Ray on this order. Quality is good. We always have the Christmas Story marathons to watch and it is shown countless other times around the holildays but the DVD makes it nice to watch any time you like it.\n",
      "Just a great movie. I look forward to watching this over and over again.This is a must for any \"Christmas collection\" !!!\n",
      "Great picture. Watch this movie every Christmas, Brings back that Christmas feelings. The best on high def. only 11 months to watch again\n",
      "From the leg lamp to the tounge stuck on the poll this is the movie all other christmas movies are judged. It's just that good and classic. I can't wait for TBS to run the 24 hours of the christmas story anymore i had to have this movie to watch over and over again.\n",
      "This is a classic type movie that is just great for Christmas. One of the reasons I labeled it classis is that is a 50s genre so some folks can be reminded of their childhood..\n",
      "A Christmas story is one of the best Christmas season, movies ever. There is actually nothing not to like about this movie. It is just great\n",
      "What an All-Time great Classic!  Lots of fun and good Holiday Humor!  A very original score!  Don't shoot your Eye out!  Hahaha\n",
      "There's only one rating to give it and too many great, classic moments to discuss them all. When the subject of this movie comes up you'll find yourself retelling favorite parts only to find out that they're all favorite parts.\n",
      "I find it strange to even rate this video.  It is the Christmas story and you either love it or hate it.  The quality of the DVD is good and played well on my Blue ray DVD player.  I love it and looking forward to my kids buying me a mannequin leg lamp for Christmas!  Come on guys you know you would love to have one!\n",
      "Until you've seen this, you ain't had Christmas. You'll shoot your eye out!  Enought said\n",
      "this movie is awesome. i watch it every year and it's always a hysterical movie. my whole family likes it.\n",
      "Every year, we watch this classic!  And every time, we pick up something new while laughing so hard we can hardly breathe...  Love this movie :)\n",
      "I give this movie a 5 star rating, simply because I love hearing Ralphie imagining his dreams of what he wants for Christmas, as well as a boy just growing up, doing things I feel little boys anticipated during this time period. One of my favorite parts is where he finally receives his Ovaltine de-coder in the mail... things like this actually did happen back then! Ralphie's father is somewhat self-centered, but when Ralphie gets his BB gun, you really understand how he did care about others, rather than just himself. There's a few language issues, which I wish substitutes could have been used to get the message across - so, I recommend parents viewing the movie first to make sure it's appropriate for your child. I feel many people enjoy this movie, and it just gets better over the years I've watched it... noticing things I missed before. To me, it's a bit exaggerated on some things that make for a good laugh, and the family seems a little \"different\" - but, all in all- it's probably more like the old days than not! Check it out - hopefully, you can write a better review than me!\n",
      "How could you NOT love this movie about Ralphie and his insatiable quest to get his Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas? I've owned this family cult classic for years on VHS and finally got my DVD copy.\n",
      "You can't go wrong with owning this story. It's one of the best christmas stories ever. So I bought it.\n",
      "It never dissappoints. Even my 4 yr old liked it and wanted to watch it again.Glad to see it's free on Prime!\n",
      "I have been watching this movie for years, every Christmas and i finally bought it ,it is a must own movie to go with your holiday classics\n",
      "What do the following have in common?A boy named Ralphie and the phrase 'You'll poke your eye out'!A Red Ryder BB Gun and a sexy, black-mesh leg that's a lamp!A Christmas Story Movie Official Table Leg LampA bar soap wielding mother and an expletive shouting father.A pepto-bismol pink Easter bunny suit and a boy who eats like a piggy.You're right! They all add up to A Christmas Story!It is about Ralphie, wonderfully played by Peter Billingsley, who longs for a Red Ryder BB Gun!He repeatedly hears 'You'll poke your eye out' every time he mentions the gun.Darrin McGavin is terrific as the contest entering father who is ecstatic when he finally wins.His prize, a leg-shaped animated lamp complete with a black mesh stocking!In his eyes the leg of lamp (I coudn't resist) is absolutely beautiful and,much to the dismay of his wife, he proudly displays it for all to see in their front window.The lamp is a major source of contention between them as each one attempts to move it.His language when anything goes wrong - from the exploding furnace to the sparking wiringto the neighbors free roaming dogs has reprecussions when, in frustration, Ralphie repeats them.Enter Mom with the soap! Don't worry you won't hear the actual words being said but you will getthe gist of it - or should that be drift, as this is a winter story.Little brother, Randy, is a picky eater and is only successfully coaxed to eat by his mother, played perfectlyby Melinda Dillon, when she has him pretend to eat like his favorite storybook animal, a pig.With his face firmly in the plate he eats like one much to the disgust of his father!Although based on the Red Ryder BB gun, there are many other storylines highlighted in this wonderful movie.There are bullies, school friends, Christmas tree lots, Santa coming to town and the hilarious Christmas giftof a  pink Easter Bunny outfit poor Ralphie has to try on. You will enjoy this movie!It takes place at a time when I was growing up and many of the scenes recall my childhood.To those of us who grew up in the forties and early fifties it brings back fond memories of our past Christmases.We had real trees adorned with tinsel and glowing with big colorful bulbs, no themed trees with just whitelights, our trees glowed with a rainbow of colors. We had favorite radio shows, wore galoshes and hadbackyards with snow covered sheds just like the ones in Ralphie's backyard.All of those are in this film, and as such, A Christmas Story has a wonderful familiarity about it.You can almost smell the heavy scent of pine mixed with the delicious aroma of a roasting turkey.This movie is a classic and will, once again, be eagerly watched by our family.Ah! Memories are made of this!~ Mrs. B. (The Boss agrees!)\n",
      "A feel good movie when Christmas tends to become overwhelming.  I can sit down and laugh and enjoy.  Brings up special and fun memories.\n",

      "This is a family favorite this time of year. We watched it with our children many years ago and now we watch it with our children and grandchildren.\n",
      "This movie has become a classic and it is not that old of a movie.  It is a very funny movie that has some spin off sales such as the lamp shaped as a leg.  I watch this movie at least one time every holiday season.\n",
      "Always a favorite during the holiday but this on I can only watch once and I'm done till the next season.\n",

      "The title pretty much sums it up.  This story goes back to the good ole days when you could have a B.B. gun and not get chastised for it.  Back to a time where it was acceptable to play cowboys and indians.  Wholesome family fun.\n",
      "Just helps me keep my childhood alive.I have heard all of the quips at least once in my life. Makes my Christmas special\n",
      "This is a very entertaining \"made to look old\" Christmas comedy of a young kid that only wants a BB gun for Christmas.\n",
      "What more do you want. This is a Christmas classic. Must watch every Christmas. great great great great christmas movie\n",
      "Based on a Jean Shepherd short story, Bob Clark's irresistible, often hilarious 40's-era holiday tale benefits from an immense heart, rich period detail, and quirky comic characters. In certain scenes--such as Ralphie's nightmarish encounter with a department-store Santa and his parents' squabbling over an indecent lamp--Bob Clark moves beyond nostalgia to lampoon the absurdity of the adult world. With note-perfect performances from the whole cast, Clark's \"Christmas Story\" is a latter-day holiday gem brightly wrapped with big laughs.\n",
      "Oh, does this film even need a review? Absolute CLASSIC! First saw it when I was 6 years old. Played it for my 7 year old this weekend and we were laughing hysterically together. Brilliant every time.\n",
      "This movie is fantastic, and is certainly one of the funniest that I have ever seen! The scene where Ralphie climbs over his little brother as they race upstairs to wash-up for dinner reminds me of when I used to do the  same thing to my younger brother. This movie is a riot, and the department  store scene with Santa is absolutely hysterical!\n",
      "Corney, yet beautiful.  Have always loved it.  Speaks to the heart of dysfunctional, yet beautiful and realistic.Glad to now own it.\n",
      "Lots of reviews (386) so I'll just add to the clutter. I never have to seek out this movie. It finds me. Last year I believe a cable station had A Christmas Story Marathon. They just ran the movie over & over & over. The dvd version with commentary might be interesting. Indeed you can have this on in the background while you wrap presents, cook, address cards etc. pausing everytime the wicked witch or Santa Claus  says to Ralphie, \"You'll shoot your eye out.\" Lots of touchstones of the time: a ditsy stay at home mom, radio shows, getting your mouth washed out with soap, hunting for the perfect Christmas tree. Darren McGavin is not exactly Ward Cleaver as the gruff, profane, childish but lovable old man. If this movie wasn't already a Christmas classic it could be a cult film.\n",
      "One of the best Christmas movies ever.  I saw this when it originally came out at the theaters, and watch it at least once a year.\n",
      "Brings all the feelings of what a family Christmas is all about. Love the story. We watch this movie on Christmas Eve every year. A true classic.\n",

      "No Christmas would be complete without a Christmas Story. I can watch this movie on repeat every winter. A classic that has stood the test of time.\n",
      "Along with Christmas Vacation, this movie is in our list of movies to watch at Christmas time.  This movie captures the spirit of what it's like to be a child at Christmas time and wanting more than anything a particular present.  A highly recommended family Christmas movie.\n",
      "This movie is our 'favorite' family movie.  It is a classic.  We must have lent it to someone last year and it wasn't returned.  So we bought another one.  Just saw the 'play' on Broadway .... fabulous !\n",
      "This is by far my Families favorite Christmas movie.  I have a leg lamp that if I don't it get out and on display right after Thanksgiving the Neighbors remind me.  This year my two sons got Red Rider BB Guns.  It was the hit present of the year.  They went out with all the grandkids  shooting paper targets for hours in the cold.\n",
      "A few years after I had grown up but the Christmas Spirit was still going strong.Darrin McGavin ,along with the rest of the cast does an Excellent job of living in that Special Time.Where Everyone said to You,\"Merry Christmas & a Happy New Year\" ...\n",
      "This is a wonderful movie that makes me laugh so hard in some spots I start crying. Who can forget being 9 and wanting one present with all your heart. To quote a pervious re-viewer get the family make some popcorn and  enjoy.  And to the one reviwer that gave it ONE star get a life.\n",
      "The classic classic Christmas story. From generation to generation -- this tale will endure. Fragile is priceless. Of course, you know this already.\n",
      "The first time I saw this movie I didn't realize the author lived in Hessville, Indiana, the same town I did in Northern Indiana, the movie referenced Harding school where I went to grade school and the department store there was Goldblatts which is probably where he first encountered Santa. BB guns were big in Hessvillle and I had one until my mother found it and bent it in half over our porch railing, lots of memories in this movie for me and I enjoyed another look at it and many more any time I feel like it now that I own it.\n",
      "This is a Christmas classic.  A large number of families watch this movie every Christmas holiday.  Blu ray brings the quality of the picture to number one but the movie substance is truly a holiday classic.\n",
      "I first watched this when I was a kid growing up in the early 1980s, and I thought it was hilarious then. Now as a parent of three young boys my wife and I laugh even more because the parenting moments in this movie are priceless!One of the best movies ever and a must-watch for this family ever Christmas. Truly a great film!-- John Nemo, author of The King's Game,Miller's MiracleandJumper\n",
      "this is a classic christmas movie it a much buy for those who collecterBUYER BEWARD THIS MOVIES IS SO GOOD THAT I BUSTED A COUCH BECAUSE I WAS SO INTO THE MOVIEbut any where enjoyed the movie don't break a couch\n",
      "A charming but still thought-provoking look at a traditional Christmas through the eyes of a now grown-up 11-year old and how he sees his parents, and the holiday.\n",
      "Awesome!!! Its A Christmas Story in Blue Ray DVD do I really need to say any more I mean really.\n",
      "Purchased through Amazon Instant Video. Overall excellent quality of both picture and sound. It was a pleasure to watch, and we'll likely purchase other movies this way.\n",
      "Its a family tradition to watch this on Christmas Eve. I was without a television but had my laptop / Amazon so the tradition was able to continue! The movie is an absolute classic.\n",
      "I was introduced to this movie in my early 20's and it quickly became a seasonal tradition! I ordered a copy for each of my adult children for their holidays so that they can start their own traditions.\n",
      "The movie speaks for itself.  It's a new classic.  We watch it every year starting after thanksgiving through Christmas.  The DVD we ordered arrived on time in great condition.  Love it.\n",

      "This is must have dvd for the Holiday season. Great movie to watch with family and/or friends.Love every single character in the movie.\n",
      "Doesn't feel like Christmas without it. A true classic with lots of fun memorable memories, can't wait to pass it down to my kids\n",
      "This is A CHRISTMAS CLASSIC!!!!! I have the DVD but the Blu-ray version ISN'T really any better. It could be if the sound was in DTS MASTER AUDIO SURROUND. If it was re-released with an improved soundtrack, I'd buy it!!!!!\n",
      "Nine-year-old Ralphie wants nothing in life more than a Red Rider BB gun.  He plots and schemes but no matter where he turns, he is thwarted by the mantra that all adults seem destined to utter, \"You'll shoot your eye out.\"  This is a simple story of one family at Christmas time and follows Ralphie as he goes to school, deals with his parents, and keeps fighting to get his BB gun.This movie was virtually invisible when it was originally released, but has since become a holiday classic.  All of us can relate to Ralphie's quest on some level, and many can probably empathize with the parents as well.  The cast was virtually perfect from top to bottom and Peter Billingsley's wide eyed innocence is particularly effective.  The other standout is Darren McGavin with a wonderful performance as the dad that is understated at some times and wildly exaggerated at others... but always striking the right note at just the right time.  The only sour note is kid brother Randy who simply whines and cries throughout the entire movie and adds nothing funny or interesting.A Christmas Story deserves to be enjoyed each year during the Christmas season.  It's a timeless story and captures a little slice of Americana in a unique and charming way.  It is shown regularly on TV, but is much more enjoyable when watched uninterrupted and unedited from the DVD.\n",
      "Best Christmas story ever as far as we are concerned, haft to see it every year, It' even better than 'Bad Santa'.\n",
      "GREAT STORY LINE AND HUMOR UNEXPECTEDLY FROM DAREN MCGAVIN ... REMEMBER KID ... YOU'LL PUT YOUR EYE OUT IF YOU DONT BUY THIS ... NOTICE HOW THE OLD CHRISTMAS CLASSICS ARE REMAKES AND TERRIBLY DONE. IF THOSE COMMIES MESS WITH \"IT A WONDERFUL LIFE\" THEY WILL REGREAT IT ... IN THE BOX OFFICE.IM SUR THEY WILL DO IT AND USE JIM CAREY SO HE CAN WIGGLE HIS BUTT AT EVERYONE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.\n",
      "I remember the first time I saw A Christmas Story. It was the holiday season of 1985 and I saw it on cable. Little did I know then how much of a lasting effect this film would have on me. From that point on I have watched A Christmas Story every holiday season. It has become a holiday tradition in my household and we watch it every year at least once. I have seen it countless times and still never tire of watching it. In fact I find myself saying many of the lines along with the film. A Christmas Story has become a christmas classic and it is a well deserved title. This movie makes me laugh and in a few scenes makes me cry but I never grow tired of watching this great film. And in the future I look forward to showing this film to my own kids so they too can experience this classic holiday film. ANd I was ecstatic when they finally released a 2 disc version of this film packed with extras. I used to own the orignal one disc release and it was bare bones with nothing on the disc but the film itself and it was in fullscreen. So finally this film has gotten the proper presentation it so deserves. I hope that this film becomes a part of your holiday tradition as it has been a part of mine for all these years.\"You'll shoot your eye out!\"\n",
      "This movie is classic.  I can't go without seeing it every Christmas season.  You'll shoot you're eye out.  Daddy's gonna kill Ralphie.  I can't put my arms down.  Frag-i-l-e, it must be italian.  Yellow eyes he had yellow eyes.  and finally... Fuuuuuudge.\n",
      "This movie is a Christmas classic.  This movie brings to mind all the childhood wonder and excitement of the holidays\n",
      "A christmas storyit is a great purchase!  i was very happy with this purchase and would recommend to any one interested in buying it.\n",
      "Great price for someone that just wants the movie and not all the special edition extras..Its a classic everyone should have!\n",
      "I got this a little cheaper than what I would have in the stores.  This is a treasured family classic.\n",
      "The best Christmas movie ever. Makes me wonder how they got my mom and dad to do a movie! So reminiscent of my childhood--always wanted a Daisy air rifle and actually borrowed one to show my mom that my arms were too short for me to shoot my eye out. Didn't work, sadly, so I just wait with bated breath to see what's under the tree for Ralphie! Love love love this movie and you will too so if you haven't seen it get it now and immerse yourself in an innocent world that is gone forever--but we get to visit through the magic of movies.\n",
      "This movie is a Christmas watch for our house and has been so for decades. It is exactly like the time ans area we grew up in many years ago. If you haven't seen it, watch it!\n",
      "I didn't realize this edition came with a strand of LEG LAMP XMAS LIGHTS in a collector tin! I was extremely pleased with this purchase. Only $17! I would of paid that price for just the Blu-Ray Disc.\n",
      "For years I have watched this movie and loved the book. Finally, I have my own copy to wear out! This is my absolute favorite Christmas movie, I love the truth of how kids perceive and deal with adults and situations.I remember the days of hearing...\"you'll shoot your eye out!\" I say it to my own kids today! Don't pass up a classic, you will cherish it!\n",
      "Complete fun for everyone. Make it a Christmas tradition for your family!  Gene Shepard was a master story teller, his narration really makes the difference.\n",
      "I heard about this collector's edition from a friend and had to get it.  I Love it. If you like the movie, enjoy watching it every year,and can't wait until Christmas to see it again, than this is one of those things that is nice to have.\n",
      "Ralphie brings back all of the sweet memories of being a child at Christmas. His family is shown in a whimsical light with endearing charm and they have all the foibles of a real family. The joy in Ralphie's eyes when he gets his prized Red Ryder BB gun reminds us all of that special Christmas gift we will never forget. Jean Shepherd is a master at illustrating what childhood innocense feels like.\n",
      "This is my favorite Christmas movie of all time! My family watches this movie together every Christmas Eve. You can't go wrong!\n",
      "One of those movies where the universe stepped in and aligned all the elements to tell a timeless tale of life; and remind you of what it felt like to be a child. Simply told, well acted, written to express the life moments that are relevant in every child's life; we have all had an \"Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle!\" that we, as a child, obsessed over. While that is the main thread of the movie, it's in the side stories of the relationships with parents, teachers, siblings, bullies and friends that makes this such a memorable and universal tale.\n",
      "This movie is a great way to spend a couple hours on a cold, snowy weekend before Christmas. It is funny, charming and the whole family can watch and enjoy.\n",
      "The movie was received when promised.  Purchased as a Christmas gift so it has not been watched yet.  From feedback I have gotten it should be a nice addition to holiday must see movies\n",
      "THIS IS THE BEST CHRISTMAS MOVIE EVER MADE!!  WE WATCH THISMOVIE EVERY CHRISTMAS!!  REAL \"FEEL GOOD\" MOVIE.WE CAN RELATE TO THIS TIME PERIOD.  GREAT MOVIE!!!\n",
      "Wanted to get this to watch with my grandson.  Shipped to me quickly in great condition.  Definately one of my favorite movies!\n",
      "Another one to watch with your family during the holidays.  My family has watched it for years and love it.  The product was in great condition and the shipping was fast.\n",
      "Our family has come to love this \"wonder years-esque\" tale of Christmas through the eyes of a 9 year old child.  Never gets old and delivers a rich feeling that reminds me of my own childhood Christmas times.\n",
      "That's it. It's a great Christmas movie that spawned a launch of drugstore Fragile's. Congratulations on the wonderful marketing! Very cute movie.\n",
      "A Christmas Story (Full-Screen Edition)My family and I Absolutely love this movie.  We watch it every christmas when it would come on TV.  I decided to purchase the DVD to watch it on Christmas or whenever we would like.  Thanks Amazon.\n",
      "One of the best Christmas movies EVER. There is literally nothing wrong with this movie. Two discs worth of content is just not enough.\n",
      "A really great family christmas movie, hilarious narration, great acting and direction and the whole entire story is about Christmas (duh). This will be enjoyed by kids and parents forever.\n",
      "I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out, and I knew immediately that I wanted to own it on video.  It has so many things that make it a great movie. There is the main character, Ralphie, with his  boyhood dreams of getting the \"bad guys\" with a Red Ryder BB gun;  the mom who has the right mix of zaniness and motherly compassion; and  Darren McGaven is great as the dad with all kinds of eccentricities, but in  the end comes through for Ralphie.  The family is great, and the little  vignettes are hilarious.  I especially liked how they went to a Chinese  restaurant for Christmas dinner, and the rules of how to dare a friend to  stick his tongue to a frozen flag pole. This movie has so much charm,  humor, and innocent sweetness that it has become one of our family  traditions, along with Charlie Brown, the Grinch, and George Bailey.\n",
      "I love this movie! The movie is funny. Whoever thought it was low budget. You'll shoot your eye out laughing at this movie! You should definetely buy this movie, by the way I'm big in Japan!\n",
      "Have watched this movie every Christmas. It reminds me of my youth and the things that went on when I was a kid.\n",
      "It's a classic and so fun! Especially if you grew up during the 50's like we did but that's not necessary. Our kids loved it.\n",
      "Instant video was a bit choppy a few times, but good overall. You just cannot beat this classic movie! boom.\n",
      "It's as much a tradition as ham or turkey or presents or family! Others may play it but a 48 hour rental is a little better!\n",
      "Classic. Hillarious. It's just not Christmas till I see \"A Christmas Story.\" I love this movie. Everyone should have it.\n",
      "I would give this movie ten stars if I could.  Pure unadulterated fun!  Such a great Christmas movie....can I still say \"Christmas\"?  Btw....Merry Christmas to everyone who believes!\n",
      "The whole cast of this show made it one of my all time favorites. Movie with a love interest and lots of music. You can't help but want to march right up there aside of this incredible multi talented man and join in.\n",
      "Who hasn't seen it a dozen times.  I hope I get a Red Ryder BB Gun for Christmas before I die!\n",
      "Here's a film that should be in everyone's \"Christmas classic\" movie collection.  It's warm, witty, irreverent and \"just right\" in its evocation of childhood.  In one way or another, everyone will recognize themselves in one scene or another - and be howling with laughter all the way through!\n",
      "I was so happy to finally be able to have the widescreen version of this favorite Christmas movie. Year after year, I could only find the full-screen version (with the sides of every scene chopped off that made me want to shoot my eye out.) So wonderful to see this wonderful story in it's full, theatrical glory. Order this today. I triple-dog dare you!\n",
      "My favorite movie to watch during the holiday season. A classic that my family and I have adopted to watch every Christmas.\n",
      "This previously-viewed CD arrived in a very timely manner and was in perfect condition and the price was more than fair!  This was my first online order of any type and I was very impressed.  I would strongly recommend this site to all of my friends, neighbors and acquaintences.  Thumbs Up!!!\n",
      "This is definitely one of my top favorite holiday movies ever!  You'll shoot your eye out!  I'll never forget that line....and the pink bunny pajamas!\n",
      "I specifically purchased this movie from Amazon because of the great price and availability.  Everything was in great shape.  I am very pleased with this purchase\n",
      "This movie is a Christmas classic. No matter how many times I watch it, it never gets old. I laugh out loud every single time I watch it. Brilliant all around!\n",
      "One of my favorite movies.  Takes me back to my childhood with family traditions around the holidays.  Great lines.  Hysterical.  Billingsly mastered the \"Ralphie\" character!!!!\n",
      "One of my favorite movies ever. I show it to my high school students every year and they too enjoy watching it.\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie!!! Wouldn't seem like Christmas without it. Great to do gift wrapping while watching this. YAY\n",
      "This has got to be one of our all time favorite Christmas movies. My family has watched the TV marathon on Christmas Eve for years so we decided to order our own copy and have our own Christmas Story marathons. A must see for families!!!!\n",

      "LOVE this classic!  This is one movie everyone in the family is able to watch.  I've never heard anyone say they didn't like it.\n",
      "This is our second favorite Christmas movie!  It appears to be set in the 50's.  This movie brings back the simpler times of Christmas and life.  The little boy wants a Red Rider BB Gun and is told, at every turn, that \"You'll shoot your eye out\", including from Santa!  Cute, cute movie..I have a Christmas ornament of the \"leg lamp\"..this is a must see for Christmas!\n",
      "Grat holiday movie and I bought this for my husband for Christmas because he loves it so.Artistically, greater then any other holiday movie!\n",
      "any one who can't overlook the mild profanity....which, in reality is never verbalized (it's all implied!  ! ! !)probably doesn't know how to laugh anymore...too much holiday stress maybe?  a christmas story is an  INNOCENT tale of  hope...one i gladly, happily share with my children and  look forward to sharing with their children.\n",
      "C'mon! Who doesn't love this movie! An icon of the holiday season, this one is not to be missed!! We watch it 24/7 on Christmas Day but of course I have to watch it during the summer just to remind me that Christmas isn't that far away!!!\n",
      "We enjoy watching this movie ever Christmas' it has become a tradition foreverone to sit around the TV and enjoy the movie as a family\n",
      "Okay - I don't know how much sociology I really taught with this movie, but it's one of my favorite Christmas movies.  What was really amazing was the quality of the rental. I showed it on a smart board to my class at school, and even on the whiteboard it was clear and colorful and looked like new!\n",
      "This is a fantastic Christmas movie. I think anyone of any age would enjoy this film. It's based on a story by Jean Shepard, who was a fantastic humorist in numerous forms. Everything I've ever seen or heard that was based on his writings has been thoroughly enjoyable. His writings, and this film in particular, give insight into a time when many of us weren't yet born. And a sweet time it was. :)\n",
      "Uh, it's the Christmas Story... Of course it gets 5 stars!! It's a Christmas staple in my family to watch it while we open gifts Christmas morning.\n",
      "i fell in love with a christmas story the first time i watched it when it first came out, and it only gets better age..\n",
      "This is the best depiction of the Holidays in the Fifties. If you had any affiliation with the Fifteis or early Sixties, this movie has many of the best memories. If interested, read Jean Shepard. He wrote the story and is the narrator; a very funny story teller. My adult children and I watch this every Christmas Eve. I bought this for a friend because one of her kids 'borrowed' her copy.\n",
      "While babysitting for 7 year old grandson , I asked him what film he would like to see via Amazon prime video.  Without even looking at the list, he said:  Christmas Story...that's my favorite!!! I loved it as well!\n",
      "This is a movie that is always part of our family's holiday line up every year! It just wouldn't be Christmas without it!\n",
      "This is another one of my favorite holiday movies.  The quality of the DVD is pretty good, no special features.  There is a two-disc version out there with features if you want more than the movie.\n",
      "Yes, its a classic and I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good laugh at Christmas time.  I like how they \"infere\" bad language by the father but we never hear it.  More movies could learn from this one.  Good job.\n",
      "Best movie ever! Giving as a gift for grandkids. Will watch it together.  Traditional holiday time spent together. Love it.\n",
      "A Christmas Story (Ultimate Collector's Edition)This was a better buy than anticipated it will be in the family for generationsto come. We have watched it every Christmas eve with first our children and now our grandchildren Excellent 5 stars\n",

      "I bought this movie because my daughter wanted it.  The price was even cheaper than Wal-mart.  I'm sure we will all have fun watching it.\n",
      "My all time favorite Christmas movie!  I was so excited to receive it in time for this last Christmas.  Even though I've seen it more times than I can count, it's always good again :)\n",
      "My whole family loves \"A Christmas Story.\"  My sister and I were born and raised in Hammond, Indiana (Shepherd's hometown which he calls \"Hohman\" in the story), and though it wasn't filmed there, Shepherd captures the essence of the scruffy old steel town.  But more than that, it's a great piece of nostalgia.  My dad loves it because it reminds him of his own childhood in the 1930's--grumpy father, sooty furnace and all.  Everyone will love it because it is a funny take on the American Christmas hullaballoo.  Yet under the cynical veneer, there is real magic, and therein lies the genius of Jean Shepherd.\n",
      "A Christmas story is a classic how can you not love it??? My mother watched it, I watch it and now my children love to watch it!\n",
      "A Christmas Story is one of my favorite Christmas Movie I watch it every December never gets old so funny classic\n",
      "Always a family tradition to watch this movie at Christmas!!  Everyone can relate to this movie! A Family favorite every year!!!\n",
      "Multiple times. Sometimes even before TBS starts the 24 hr round of it on Christmas day. There's no need to feel shame about that.\n",
      "Every year my kids and grandkids get sick of me making them watch this with me over and over again at Christmas. It sure takes me back to the old days and reminds me of my childhood.\n",
      "the best memories watching this movie with my siblings and the laughs you remember from a child. so glad I  bought it\n",
      "In our house it isn't Christmas until you've put on this classic movie to watch with the whole family. Love it!\n",
      "Would like to view complete movie. It stopped midway through and I couldn't view the end. Please, credit my account or allow me to view complete movie.\n",
      "watch it every christmas several times. i got the lamp,red ryder, & lava soap in my living room on display,.\n",
      "BEST CHRISTMAS MOVIE OF ALL TIME! The DVD case was flimsy and felt cheap, I wasn't too crazy about that but as long as the DVD, it worked just fine.\n",
      "This is the one for young and old alike!  It sums up all the bad and good about Christmas, but at the end of the movie, you are rooting for him to get the Red Rider bb gun!  It's a feel good movie that my eldest son watches all day without fail every single CHristmas since he was a boy!  (which of course means we watch it too).\n",
      "This is my all time favorite movie ever!! I love this movie. Christmas would definitly not be the same with out it. I think I speak for everyone when I speak about this movie\n",
      "very good and that is no joke, mom really likes the movie, it is her favorite and she will watch each xmas\n",
      "Loved it! My favorite Christmas movie.Hilarious from beginning to end.Happy,upbeat feeling throughout.A lot of vintage things.If you're a baby boomer you might relate to the Christmas tree that's a real cedar tree,the long strands of silver tinsel that used to come in rectangular boxes,and the big Christmas lights.That and the father's ongoing war with his coal furnace.I strongly recommend \"A Christmas Story\" for anyone of any faith,or none,and anyone of any age.It's rated PG.When Ralphie says \"The mother of all dirty words\" you don't technically hear him say it.It's great fun about a real family. The whole movie is syrup-free.There's no pushing any religion,no trying to sell the idea that everyone else has a Hallmark Christmas, no rubbing peoples' noses in it if they don't have a perfect family and house,OR if they aren't getting engaged to a prince or princess on Christmas.It does,however have snow,Christmas lights,vintage toys,and much about what it's like being a child at Christmas.If you were lucky enough to have had some good winter holidays,as a child,this movie takes you right back and puts you in the situation again.It all comes back to you.If your childhood holidays left you with not-good memories then,as the saying goes,\"It's never too late to have a happy childhood.\"This movie will finally put you in the situation of having a happy childhood at Christmastime.I think you'll like it.\n",
      "My husband's favorite movie.  Price was good.  Couldn't go wrong ordering it to make this a part of our dvd library.\n",
      "Actually this purchase is for a Christmas gift and I have no qualms regarding the quality of this product.  As usual, it arrived when it was promised and in very good condition.  Always appreciate working with Amazon and I already have my next list of movies started.  Thanks, sincerely Karen Whitmer\n",
      "I watch this movie every year forgetting how hilarious it is and that every minute something is happening.  I love this movie\n",
      "This is quite possibly the funniest movie I've ever seen.  My holiday season officially begins the first time I watch \"A Christmas Story\".  The movie features wondefully comedic writing, especially in  the very effective narrative framework as Peter Billingsley's character  \"Ralphie\", now grown, describes the events and characters leading  up to the Christmas he receives his first Red Ryder BB Gun, the highlight  of his young life.  Darren McGavin is hilarious as Ralphie's dad, and  everytime I see \"Kenny\" on \"South Park\" I think of the  little brother all bundled up in his snowsuit and parka trying to keep up  with the big boys.  It's a wonderful family movie.  Anyone who watches it  can see a piece of their own childhood in the film--the Bumpas' dogs, the  bully Scott Farkas, the admonition that a toy will \"shoot your eye  out.\"  It's beautiful.  Watch, rent, buy this movie.  You won't regret  it.  And don't take any triple dog dares involving flag poles!\n",
      "This movie is a Classic.It's not the greatest movie ever made ,but it's a wonderful family movie. My kids just love watching it around the holidays.Can't go wrong.\n",
      "Having recently visited The Christmas Story House in Cleveland, Ohio, the tour gave me a behind the scenes story of this production.  I even met the man who pushed the cart to deliver The lamp.  He lived a few doors down and was cast as an extra!\n",
      "It looks like a great Collector's Editionon blu-ray disc. I have seen the movie 2 times and Iwill see it again this Christmas. Everybody shouldown it because it's just that it's a GREAT FILM!!!\n",
      "This movie is a classic. There are so many funny sub-plots and the cast and the dream sequences were amazing, 5 Stars without a doubt.\n",
      "This movie has been a favorite of mine for years, and to now finally see it in the clarity of blu-ray puts the star on top of the Christmas tree.\n",
      "The package arived on time, wraped in great condition, plays well, awesome movie. Would definately recomend this to anyone for any season.\n",
      "This movie captures the spirit of  the environment we grew up in during a simpler time.  \"Don't shoot your eye out.\"\n",
      "The is a wonderful Christmas Story of the 1940's.It brought back memories of when I was a child.Many funny moments. Should be owned by everyone.A real \"Classic\".\n",
      "We watch this movie every year on Christmas eve and Christmas day. It's on all day and my girls want to watch it over and over. I'm glad I bought it so we can enjoy it all year.\n",
      "Hands down, the best of em all.  Though the film, according to director Bob Clark, is set in 1940, it might as well be \"any year\" since this film captures the magic, anticipation, elation, and madness that Xmas creates in the heart of a child to a tee regardless of the decade.  Everyone can remember the quest for that one special toy...the plotting, the planning, the wishing, the whining, the begging,...did I mention the WHINING?  Its all here but wrapped in a film with just the perfect blend of heart and hilarity.If you haven't seen it, where have you been?!  TNT has the run the film continuously for 24 hours on Xmas eve for the last two Christmas seasons!I loved this DVD set, it was great seeing Peter Billingsly all grown up (though he is not near as animated as he was 20 years ago :) and it was fun listening to the commentary.  My only critisism would be that there were not enough \"inside\" shot by shot anecdotes.  But Bob Clark didn't seem to recall enough and Peter Billingsly was a kid when he shot the film.  But no matter, this DVD is a must have next Xmas season.\n",
      "Did you know that its a proven fact that if you don't like this movie and watch it at least once every year between Thanksgiving and Christmas you're a communist?\n",
      "I need to return it as I bought the wrong zone. I'm in Australia. I have not opened it.\n",
      "I love this movie. One of my all time favorites. Every scene and sound reminds me of watching it in my childhood.\n",
      "A must see every Christmass,one of three must see's, the other two Scrooged and National Lampoon'sChristmass Vacation.  Merry Christmass!\n",
      "This is a classic Christmas movie for me, watch it every year! Everyone should see at least once in their life!\n",
      "Christmas classic! Darrin McGavin is slendid in this movie, playing the bumbling father who doesn't seem to have a clue! He does come through with his son's wishes for a Red Ryder BB gun, though!\n",
      "There was an issue with this product, but it was immediately resolved by seller.Thank you, would order from them again.\n",
      "This is one of the best movies as well as a great Christmas movie.  It will remind all of us some point in our childhood.  We purchased more as gifts and heard from our friends as soon as they watched the movie.  They loved it.  Recommend to all.\n",
      "One of my fondest memories of Christmas as a child is watching this wonderful classic with my family every year. And unlike most movies you see over and over as a kid, I found myself loving this movie the older I got. It's a testament to all involved with this movie that I, and everyone I've talked to, feel this way. My holidays aren't complete without revisiting Ralphie and his slightly eccentric family. I still die laughing when Ralphie's oblivious mother asks where he learned to curse, and calls up his friends house instigating a beating. And when the \"leg lamp\" arrives marked fraa-gee-lay(it's french), and Ralphie's mother does everything to avoid putting it up. But I always love \"Oh Fudge\".\n",
      "I recently had the inauspicious pleasure of viewing \"The Polar Express\" for the first time, and it made me think about some of my favorite holiday films.  \"Express\" has been championed from its inception as an INSTANT CHRISTMAS CLASSIC.  Well, I'm sorry, I just don't get it.  The film, for all its technical merit, goes through the motions rather routinely serving up obvious heapings of message after heartwarming message.  It lacks a subtlety and restraint that I, for one, would have appreciated.  (And I apologize if you loved \"Express\" as most do, it's just not for me.)  But the bigger question for me was--\"Can a film be an instant classic?\"  To my mind, the answer is no--a classic evolves.The phenomena of a regular film evolving into a classic is rather indefinable, but very exciting in hindsight.  A premiere example is \"A Christmas Story.\"  Released in 1983, \"Story\" dropped into theaters with little fanfare and even smaller box office success.  A wistful and nostalgic look at the childhood of humorist Jean Shepherd, the film recounts, in hilarious detail, one child's quest for the ultimate Christmas gift.  As a metaphor for happiness itself, a Red Ryder BB Gun is all Ralphie desires for the upcoming holiday.  Using fantasy sequences and over-the-top comic portrayals, this film still manages to be grounded in reality.  For the film understands how kids think, how parents react, and has such warmth and joy at its foundation.  The small town Americana of a bygone era is lovingly recreated, and the film hearkens back to an innocent time where the worst that could happen was a run-in with a town bully or perhaps \"shooting your eye out\" with a new BB gun.The screenplay is so rich and funny, I know people who can quote whole passages from this film.  And there's lots of great material to work with!  The performances are spot on.  Peter Billingsly is fantastic as Ralphie--and even today, he is identified with this iconic role.  Melinda Dillon is perfect as the sweet, put-upon mother.  But who can forget Darrin McGavin, in an uncharacteristic comedic performance, as Ralphie's dad?  It is a perfectly nuanced performance--gruff and hard on the exterior, but succumbing to a childlike wonderment of his own at winning a \"major prize.\"\"A Christmas Story\" is sweet without being cloying, carries a message without being obvious, and is suitable for the whole family without \"dumbing itself down\" for children.  And for these reasons, people started discovering \"Story\" through the years--on cable, on VHS, and now on DVD.  One Cable TV station has even broadcast it for 24 hours straight on Christmas Eve for the last several years.  If this isn't a testament to \"A Christmas Story\"'s enduring appeal, I don't know what is.  Now a bona fide Christmas Classic--no one had to proclaim it or convince people of its merit.  People have decided for themselves.  And for anyone who thought I lacked Christmas spirit for daring to question \"The Polar Express\"--here it is.  I reserved it for a movie that has earned my love and respect, not one that demanded it.  KGHarris, 12/06.\n",
      "Brings back old memories.  I watch it every year and figured it would be nice to have my own copy.\n",
      "I LOVE this Christmas movie and in my opinon it's probably one of the best movies ever made in the United States. Based upon the life and real-true story of Jean Shepard the movie takes place when a young boy Ralphie wants a coveted Red Ryder B.B. gun but his mother tells him \"no you'll shoot your eye out.\" So, all his Christmas hopes are dashed... but, not giving up Ralphie deals with some hillarous incidents in dealings with bullies, teachers, and even a store Santa to get the toy of his dreams.This will remain to be a classic in American homes for generations to come. Kids will love the movie for they can relate to that \"gotta have toy\" feeling and adults will remember what it was like- to be a child around Christmas or what their FAVORITE Christmas was like.Written very well this smart witted comedy gets laughs no matter how many times you watch it. Jean Sheppard's voiceovers as the Older Ralphie fit in perfectly with the younger Ralphie's antics.This movie will bring a smile to any kid or adults face and is the perfect Christmas present or DVD to watch around Christmas. Hit the buy now button and don't miss out!\n",
      "My favorite of my holiday video collection.  Every time I watch it I come away with having learned something new.  Great fun for the entire family, a video you'll treasure well into the next millenium.  If you haven't yet  started a Christmas video collection; start one with this!\n",
      "would recommend it to all  it is heartwarming and wholesome - mostlygave it to my  child for an xmas present\n",
      "This film is a really cute \"boy\" film. With three grandsons I can tell you that it is rare to find such a movie. We even went see it in play form in New York City. It was fabulous. We will watch this movie every year.\n",
      "My whole family gets together Christmas Eve and watches a movie.  This year I brought the Christmas Story, and it's the first movie EVERYONE has liked.  It's imaginative, and silly with plenty of adult humor tossed in for the grown ups.  This movie will be our new tradition, one everyone actually sat all the way through.\n",
      "I watch this every year at Christmas. I find it hilarious. It is a definite mood elevator.  A great movie the family can watch together.\n",
      "Love this movie. Son Marathon watches it Christmas eve and day for the past 10 years at least. yes. yes.\n",
      "I love this Christmas movie.  I love the old-timey feel of it.  Of course, being from Cleveland myself, I do enjoy seeing the old downtown Higbees department store (which is now a casino).  Brings back memories.  Great family movie\n",
      "For those who were born from 1946 to 1964 (aka: baby boomers), this SHOULD BE in your DVD collection. The locations, architecture, interiors, and even the appliances are familiar to us who grew up in this time period. Even the department stores look like the old Sears Roebucks and JC Penney's! If there was a way to go back to those cozy times, the smell of popcorn, Christmas food and treats, this movie is the first step. You'll laugh, and yet inside you'll shed a tear for the good old days.\n",
      "Every year me and my daughter watch this movie around the Holidays and it is just as funny as the year before...The things Ralphie goes through to get the Rifle of his dreams for Christmas is hilarious..He goes to see Santa,  writes the Great Essay and the sticking the pictures in between his parents favorite magazine..Im sure we all have done some of these things..Ralphie and his freinds and family give up a lot of laughs in this movie...\n",
      "Fun to share with a whole new generation. We enjoy this movie year 'round it has turned into a family classic.\n",
      "This is a TV classic for anyone!  I look forward to watching it every year at Christmas time!  Great for the entire family!\n",
      "I would have given 5 star but for a few pixelized pictures, Other than that the movie was great and would watch it every year.\n",
      "This is my favorite Christmas movie of all time. I make sure to watch it every holiday season. I did not have this on DVD, and it was at a great price. If you have not seen this movie, it is a must watch!\n",
      "This is the best christmas movie ever.  I watch this movie every year on christmas. Its a great movie for the whole family to watch.\n",
      "This classic has become a Christmas tradition in our house.  Not to be viewed until the day after Thanksgiving, we look forward to our last bites of turkey ans stuffing.  The 24-hour marathon last Christmas Eve kept us  company while we wrapped gifts well into the night.  Except for a few swear  words (the movie would NOT be the same without them), I recommend this  movie for the entire family. It should be a part of your permanent video  collection.\n",
      "Always a classic and will continue to enjoy it every Christmas for as many years as my friends and family will let me.\n",
      "An instant holiday classic when it came out, it still holds up as one of the best Christmas movies of all time. An iconic tale of a boy and his dreams - it captures the essence of being a child and longing for that one gift that will make this Christmas the best Christmas ever! How many times did I feel the same way...\n",
      "We watch this every Christmas Eve when it plays on TV for 24 hours straight!  It has been a tradition with my dad ever since he and my mother divorced when I was 14 and we had to do Christmas Eve at his house and Christmas with my mom.  I'm now 31, married with two kids of my own and we still watch it every Christmas Eve with my dad.  :)  Love it!\n",
      "A classic that you can't NOT watch at Christmastime.  My favorite scene is when the Bumpuses (sp?) dogs steal the turkey and Ralphie's dad explodes.\n",
      "I remember seeing this movie at the theater the year it came out.  I think that this movie is hilarious!  There are soo many funny parts to the movie that they are too numerous to name here.For those of you who are not familiar with the movie.  It is set in the 1940s at Christmastime in Indiana.  Ralphie wants a Red Rider BB gun.  Every time he mentions it to an adult, the adult tells him that he will shoot his eye out with it.  You will need to watch the movie to see if Ralphie gets the BB gun or not. :)\n",
      "So if you haven't see this movie, it is a MUST see.  It is a story of a vintage family during Christmas.  There are too many funnies to mention like getting your tongue stuck to a pole, wild dogs eating their Christmas turkey, a little boy forced to wear a hidious pink costume made by his Aunt Clara.  Oh- one more....\"Soap poisoning!\"Mommy's High Heel Shoes\n",
      "One of the classics! We love this movie! It is so funny! We had great family time watching it! We adore Christmas movies and have now purchased this to add to our collection. Thanks Amazon!\n",
      "My all time favorite Christmas movie! I love to watch the marathons every year. I had it on VHS and now am upgrading to DVD.\n",
      "This is the best Christmas of all time I've been watching this movie every Christmas for the past 20 years !!!!!\n",
      "This movie is a \"must watch\" every year. Great video and very pleased with the transaction made! Thank you, thank you...\n",
      "As always, this is a great movie! I use a playstation 3 to watch my Blu Ray's! The picture quality is just slightly better than what it was shot in, and the audio is still in a mono format, but it is still a great movie! I think the picture keeps it true to it's roots and give it that oldies feel, so they were good in not doing much to it! However, I do feel the audio could have been cleaned up and enhanced more. I will enjoy my blu ray Christmas Story!\n",
      "Ralphie's story is one of childhood want. All he wants is a trusty Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas, but is constantly told \"You'll shoot your eye out!\" His young mind schemes to get the gun and the cut-in scenes of his daydreams are hilarious. The movie's setting (the 1940s) is a simple time, but there is so much texture to the story with the neighbors dogs, the school bully, the leg lamp and the famous 'oh f-f-f-fudge!' scene. This movie is a holiday classic, even more so to me than the Grinch.\n",
      "4.5 starsNever saw this as a kid, somehow. I liked it last week, though, and wished I had seen it as a boy so I could have used it to convince my folks to get me a bb gun!My mom said \"You'll shoot your eye out\" pretty often too. It's a good line, one of the few I had no decent comeback to. \"I've got two\" never seemed very impressive. Fortunately I still do have both eyes, and they enjoyed this movie. It's well-written and moves along nicely. McGavin is exceptionally funny at times...the Night Stalker as family man.Don't let your boy see this unless you're ready to have the \"bb-gun talk\"!\n",
      "Really loved watching this video with my 8 year old son. It shows 1950's family and community dynamic. Great themes to discuss with the middle aged child, i.e. the bully, peer pressure, bad words ect. It's has plenty of humor too.\n",
      "We love watching this movie all Christmas season long. I had to order it since it doesn't come on overseas like it does in the States. Our Christmas is now complete! HA!\n",
      "I always crack up when I see this film!I like when the kid sticks his toungh to the flag pole and when Ralphie finally has enough of the bully Scott Fargas and teaches him a lesson!I have a question however.Wouldn't it  have been neat when we were all kids and went to see Santa Clause if there  was a slide to slide down like the one in the movie?I just thought I would  mention it.This movie relates to the way things were in a lot of our  childhood memories with a humorous twist.I find it very entertaining.\n",
      "You cant go wrong buying this movie & adding it to your collection. Young & old, even the scrooge in your family can't help to smile while watching.\n",
      "This movie is one that everyone should have a copy of to watch around the holidays, no matter how old you are.\n",
      "This iconic story is timeless.  The over-loaded plug outlets, the too-tall trees, SOAP.  If you don't already have this in your Christmas collection, it is great!!\n",
      "I missed this when it came out in the eighties.  My friends turned me on to this a couple of years ago.  It is a hoot.\n",
      "This fun christmas comedy classic that just been a new member of the National Film Registry in the Library of Congress as a real classic that the movie that been entertaining many of us folks for about thirty years now and be a Christmas eve and Christmas day 24 hour marathon tradtion on TBS for years and TNT before that and thankful we will pretend that it's completely unnecessary Christmas Story follow up doesn't excise at all even that we have the first sequel My Summer Story that its way better even its not as good as A Christmas Story 1 and more better off watching than A Christmas Story 2 anyday at anytime! As the words of everyone said to Ralphie, about getting his red ryder bb gun, You'll shoot your eye out! and we're keep laughing for many more years to come!\n",
      "...I know that WTBS runs this movie for a full 24-hours over Christmas Day.  Of course, you can record it off the air -- you can even Tivo it.But guess what: the full *uninterrupted* movie is 100% worth having, if for no other reason than to encourage similar movies to be made.Who says that Christmas Classics have not been made since the 1940s?My favorite scene: Two little bullies have been terrifying the boys of the neighborhood, and suddenly (with appropriate provocation) Ralphie absolutely *BEATS THE SNOT* out of *both* of them, and especially the bigger bully.  And then he cries when his mother stops the beatings.  Then there's the aftermath of the \"fight\": but watch it for yourself.Also, some catalog offers a \"lamp\" exactly like the *Grand Prize* lamp.  Oughta get one myself...\n",
      "The Christmas holidays would not be the same without viewing, A Christmas Story.  Nostalgic, funny, and heartwarming, it offers something for everyone.\n",
      "Good time for all. Makes me laugh more every time I watch. \"You'll shoot your eye out kid\" Ho Ho Ho.\n",
      "A classic. Great for all kids and everyone who used to be a kid and remembers what it was like.\n",
      "One of the best, if not the best, Christmas movies ever made! I triple dog dare you to find a better Christmas movie.\n",
      "We love our Christmas movies! You have to watch this and have it in your movie library if you like Christmas movies.\n",
      "I'm sure I want say anything that any other Christmas Story fan hasn't already said.  What a classic!  We don't usually buy DVD's, but this was a must!\n",
      "This is the best, down to earth Christmas movie I have ever seen.Excellent! We all loved it!  Even our 4 year old asks us \"please can we watch it again?\" I LOVE this movie and so does every one of our  six family members.\n",
      "What can I say...it is a classic and I watch it every year and once in awhile during the year!\n",
      "This is a timeless classic. The story is narrated by an adult, reflecting back on the anxiety and desire he experienced the year he longed for a Red Rider BB gun for Christmas.  The movie is relevant today with it's humorous reflection of life, seen through the eyes of a boy,  and especial those of us who grew up in late 50's.  Our family and friends have weaved some of the universally appropriate lines into the daily fabric of our social circle. The story is is brilliantly told with charming and heartwarming skill.\n",
      "i ordered this for my mom. she grew up in the 1940s and can surely relate to ralphie and randy's home life.she laughed like a jackel and that it what i had hoped for. thanks for the speedy service.\n",
      "Classic story!  My family makes watching this movie a Christmas tradition.  We all love it and quote certain lines all the time.  Just good all around family entertainment.\n",
      "Only two things make me laugh like some of the things in Christmas Story.The other is the WKRP episode where the turkeys are thrown from the helicopter, by Mr Carlson.\n",
      "I really love this movie because it shows how life was back around 1945 or so; anyway that's how it was when I was young.  I bought the movie so I can watch it whenever I want.  It is a real pick-me-up kind of a movie.  One you can laugh to yourself through the whole show.  Love it.\n",
      "One can't beat this delightful story for a trip back in time.  It is refreshing each time we watch it.\n",
      "This movie is brilliantly funny!  Anyone who ever celebrated Christmas with their family, walked to school in the snow, or got their mouth washed out with soap will relate to this movie.\n",
      "Athough the timeframe predates me (the forties?), I feel like it captures a kid's view of life in the 1960s and early 70s as well.  Anyone who ever convinced another kid to put his tongue on a metal pole in freezing weather (me, my brother), will appreciate this homage to childhood.  Don't let another year go by without purchasing this! A great film for an awesome price.\n",
      "If you haven't seen this movie by now, come out of your cave.  It's the classic American Christmas tale when Santa did bring dreams, and all was right with the world.\n",
      "This is a Classic Amercian movie/book and a happy story for all ages to watch together and make memories! We love it.\n",
      "A Christmas classic! I watch it every year. Would not be Christmas without it. Superb..Excellent! You don't want to miss it!\n",
      "we watch it every year and never tire of it. It takes us back to the simpler life we knew\n",
      "One of my favorite Christmas movies of all time.  Bought a few of these for gifts, and added some good cocoa and popcorn for a nice evening in this busy season.\n",
      "For those of us that remember christmas as a kid, it reminds us of the anticipation of wanting a specific toy knowing that it was far from our reach. For those that are the later generations the story shows that even a simple gift can be so rewarding.  It's a great christmas movie from a kids point of view.  Also deals with the bully situation lol.\n",
      "Bought as a gift for my husband.  He watches this movie every year.....Now he can watch it whenever he wants to, doesn't have to wait for it to come on tv....\n",
      "A must see every Christmas season. Funny, witty, great for the whole family. This movie will become a family tradition.\n",
      "Especially meaningful for those of us that grew up in the 50's. Wonderful movie with wonderful character portrayals of an American Christmas  in the 50's.\n",
      "Christmas just isn't Christmas without this as part of your Christmas Eve Film Festival. This is truly a holiday classic and favorite.\n",
      "WOW, is the first word that comes to mind after seeing this movie... WOW! A christmas story is about, surprise, surprise, a christmas for your all-american family. One of the members of the family, a golden-haired  little boy named Ralphie, wishes for a \"Red Ryder BB gun\" for  christmas, more than anything. But, to his dismay, he is told again and  again by all the adults in his life that he can't have one, 'cause he'll  \"shoot his eye out\".This movie is about what Ralphie does in  an attempt to get his coveted gun... and the results are hilarious! Thrown  into the mix for good measure is a crush on a school teacher, a  tounge-stuck-to-a-frozen-pole, and numerous attacks by the thuggish town  bully. I finished this movie feeling like a nine-year-old again.\n",
      "This movie is great. It's the kind that even if you don't like it you'll watch it at least once come Christmas time.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite movies.  We watch the movie at least twice during the holiday season. Enjoy the movie!LGP\n",
      "I would recommend this movie to anybody, young or old. This is so hilarious and a timeless classic to watch for the holidays. What a great bargain too!\n",

      "This has become a family favorite; and it's so nice to have one at home knowing we don't have to rent it online or wait to see when it's viewed during the holidays (& missing it).

      "It's a Christmas classic.  I watch it around Thanksgiving every year, to get me in the holiday spirit, and to make me laugh.  It reminds me of a kid's point of view, and that I can laugh when things don't go as planned.\n",

      "A tongue in cheek look at a family Christmas journey. EVERYONE can identify with something in this film.  Fun for all!\n",
      "This is a great movie! I can not find this movie in the stores and this movie is not shown on television. During the holidays I look on every channel on television to see if they are giving this movie and they don't. I don't know why because it is a Christmas movie. My daughter and I love this movie. It is a funny and a classic holiday movie.\n",
      "Just too funny! I make my family watch this all day long on Christmas Day(yes, they tolerate me well), 'tis the season to be merry!\n",
      "I LOVE THIS MOVIE. It is kid-friendly, while still appealing to adult humor. This is my second copy of this movie, since I gave my original to someone who had never seen it before (can you believe it?) and never received it back. I forgive them.  ;)\n",
      "I have found it important to make sure my kids don't forget some of the classic movies and this is one of them.  My little girl loved it and I got a kick out of watching it again myself.  Another one of the Christmas \"Must Own\" movies!\n",
      "I love this movie and it wouldn't be Christmas if I couldn't watch it at least A HUNDRED times! It's not a sappy \"what would life be like without Ralphie\" movie. It's real life! If you wander through life with rose colored glasses on, this movie is not for you, it's for the rest of us!I also had to buy My Summer Story, just because it's about Ralphie.\n",

      "Classic Christmas Movie! I have been watching this since I was a kid.  To anyone who has never seen it and needs a laugh on Christmas, give it a try!\n",
      "It is a beautifully done ole fashioned Christmas movie..Very enjoyable and took me back to yesterday.The locations and acting were supberb.\n",
      "My family and I watch this every year.  Can't get enough of Ralphie and his Red Ryder BB Gun story.  His father is a hoot, and his friends always good for a laugh.\n",
      "We had this on VHS but wanted it on DVD to keep it for years to come...  A classic that every family should watch at Christmas time...\n",
      "Think back to those Christmases from your childhood ... Isn't there one that stands out in your memory as the \"Christmas to end all Christmases\"?  You wanted a particular toy more than anything, more than life itself.  You did everything in your power to ensure its delivery, behaving in your most responsible mature way, making sure Santa knew about it (you had your doubts about Santa, but you wanted to hedge your bets).Such is the premise for \"A Christmas Story.\"  Peter Billingsley as Ralphie gives a sterling performance, a perfect combination of childhood naivete' and more mature observation.  Darrin McGavin is wonderful as Ralphie's dad, \"the old man,\" exuding boyish joy while at the same time trying to act like a \"father.\"  The only casting choice that I questioned was Melinda Dillon as Ralphie's mother -- she does a fine job, though, and in the end is a nice match for Darrin McGavin.The story is narrated by Jean Shepherd himself, in a sort of midwest-accented Tom Bodette or Garrison Keillor style.  It works beautifully, lending a sort of sepia-toned nostalgic tone to the story.If you're looking for a replacement (or addition) to \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" this is a good candidate.  It's funnier (the Bumpus's worthless pack of bloodhounds almost steal the show a couple of times), and (I feel) more realistic -- something the entire family can enjoy!\n",
      "I grew up 20 years later than Ralphie and Randy, yet still remember all those wonderful things at Christmastime: a big department store with Santaland and an expanded toy department, a downtown Christmas parade, going out to get the tree from a tree lot, Bing Crosby playing on the phonograph, plus Dad being gruff and a bit contentious, Mom a worrier but understanding just when you needed her. Oh, I had TV instead of radio, our furnace was oil instead of coal, and the toys and cars were a bit different, but A Christmas Story wrapped up all my memories in a hilarious package. The new DVD is terrific: a great picture in widescreen, Jean Shepherd reading the original stories that inspired situations in the film, seeing Peter Billingsly and the other kids twenty years later. Highly recommended.\n",
      "This is particularly meaningful for those of us who were actually kids during that time.  It's a family favorite ever since our boys went to the movie theater and saw it with their dad, who had a red rider bb gun.\n",
      "How do movies become classics?  I am clueless to answer.  I do not remember seeing \"A Christmas Story\" advertised in 1983.  This movie did very poorly in theaters.  Perhaps this low-budget film suffered from lack of support.  The movie does not compare with typical Christmas movie releases that emphasize mega-budgets and big-name stars.  Maybe we were all looking in the wrong place for entertainment.The movie is based on the late Jean Shepherd's book, \"In God We Trust, All Other's Pay Cash.\"  Jean Shepherd also narrates this marvelous movie, as well as appearing in the film.  Jean's narration is wonderful and really helps to make this movie successful.  The story is inspired by real life events (even if they did not happen to Jean, they happened to others - trust me on this).  Jean managed to capture the feel of Christmas in the Midwest in the post-World War II era.  Actually, the Midwest had this feel into the 1950's and 1960's.  I recall myself asking for a BB gun in the 1960's and the answer was - yep, you guessed it - you'll shoot your eye out!The Midwest has always been a peculiar place when compared with the coasts.  While the Midwest is just as advanced as either coast, it somehow feels more nostalgic and archaic.  In some small towns, like the fictional Hohman, Indiana, entering town feels like stepping back several decades.  The display windows of stores were a big deal in past decades, from coast to coast.  Toy trains were often a feature of window displays.  The display in Higbee's (which was a real chain of stores in Ohio) was a classic store display.  I admit that I fail to recall the kind of store Santa that Higbee's had.  The Santa's that I visited in the past had fancy chairs, but they were on the ground.The bully was nicely played in this movie.  As Jean Shepherd noted after the incident between Ralphie and Farkus, once you stood up to the bullies they often stopped bothering you.  I guess it was only fun being a bully when the smaller kids ran away.Ralphie and the broken glasses is also classic.  Glasses were expensive and parent continually advised their children to take care of them.  Ralphie had to think fast after accidentally crunching his glasses.  If Ralphie had revealed that he stepped on his glasses after they fell off because of a ricocheting BB, his parents would like have confiscated his BB gun until he turned 50, or maybe older.The list of events in this movie that defines an era is lengthy.  As I noted before, while the specific incidents may not have been true, they were inspired by actual events.  Jean Shepherd did a phenomenal job of capturing the essence of a region and an era.  Jean clearly loved his childhood in the Midwest, his parents and had a strong nostalgia for an era that is rapidly fading into the distant past.Does the movie have a \"message,\" which one reviewer suggested the movie does not?  This movie has lots of messages.  Note Ralphies' reaction to his Little Orphan Annie decoder; Message:  It's a crummy commercial.  Ralphies' first experience with his Red Ryder BB gun; Message:  Your parent's may actually know what they are talking about and you should take greater care in following their advice.  Ralphie and the bullies; Message:  Sometimes you need to stop letting bullies push you around.  Okay, enough messages.  This movie is filled with messages.  If you failed to find one, you were looking somewhere else - like your navel, or a picture book.Though there is minimal significance to awards for a movie like this, this movie obtained nominations for thirteen awards of various types, and it won two.  Good job!\"A Christmas Story\" may only be a great family Christmas movie for a while.  That \"while\" may only be as long as there are enough of us that remember the 1940's, the 1950's and the early 1960's.  Until then, I plan to watch this movie again and again.Enjoy!\n",
      "I have watched this movie since I was a kid, as I am sure many have. It's funny, sweet, surprising and just down-right an all American classic. If you haven't seen it, where in the world have you been?!\n",
      "Always a great movie! My Grandchildren love to watch this very year. It is better that expected on BluRay too!\n",
      "It made me remember those days and I laughed a lot. I would reccomend this movie for the family it is very funny.\n",
      "A story for all ages. Somehow I had never seen or heard of this film. I must have been living under a rock.\n",
      "I ordered this on lline when I could not find it in Walmart or Target.  I probably paid more but watched it early afternoon with my grandaughters and such belly laughs.  For a low dollar production it was well worth it and the extra disc about the characters 20 years later was great.\n",
      "...and clichés.Some folks walk around during the Christmas season with quotes from this picture on their lips not even being aware of the origin!  Let alone ANY time the subject of a BB gun comes up.\n",
      "We decorate the tree with A Christmas story playing on the TV.My VHS video needed replacement, so purchased the DVD.\n",
      "One of our favorite Christmas movies is better than ever in HD!  We enjoyed watching this every year, but this year it was as if we were watching a new and better version!  The quality of the HD re-do is fabulous (unlike the HD re-do of \"Christmas Vacation\").  We could see objects never before fully visible on the non HD versions.  Thanks MGM/WB!!\n",
      "we watch this movie every christmas my family loves it  it wouldn't be christmas if we didn't watch this great movie.\n",
      "As product described . Thank you . Love both movies. Ill watch them goe years to come.thank u again ..\n",
      "This story of Ralphie and his longing for a specific Christmas present is one of the best movies ever in my book. I've watched it so many times by now that several lines from the movie have become a part of the fabric of every day events. For instance, I think of Ralphie if I'm waiting in a long line that is backed up to Terre Haute, and of course any time I see Santa at a shopping center I'm reminded of Ho-Ho-Ho. Please....be.....sure...to......watch A Christmas Story at least once a year.\n",
      "I loved the story when i first viewed it in 1986 and I STILL do.It is one of the best holiday comedies ever written.Anyone who lived in the 40's will absolteuly be transported back there.Those that didn't , will still find this moe full of many laughs.\n",
      "My grand children wanted this film & they rated it . They say it's funny, very,very funny, & they plan 2 watch again today\n",
      "We loved the movie.  It was great especially for the over 40 group that could identify with both the parents and the kids (when we were younger living in the snow).  I would not spend the extra money on the blu-ray version.  The regular DVD would have been just the same. We couldn't notice any difference.\n",
      "It was so nice to get out from under TNT's monopoly on this film! The quality is great, and now we can watch it anytime we want!\n",
      "I bought this movie as a gift.  It was well received.  The movie is a classic and we enjoyed adding it to our collection\n",
      "It wouldn't be Christmas without A Christmas Story!  My children grew up watching this movie at Christmas and it has become a part of our family's holiday traditions!  Love it!\n",
      "and it has become a family tradition.  Even though we can say the lines it still makes you crack up laughing!\n",
      "If you enjoy Christmas then you must have this in your Christmas move collection. This is a timeless family movie that is just a must have.\n",
      "The people that have rated this movie less than 5 stars apparently take themselves too seriously and/or live in an idealistic fantasy world.  Face it people, Ralphie IS an everyday kid who swears and wants a gun and fantasizes about misadventures with bad guys and fights with his little brother.  And THAT'S what makes this movie so doggone special!!!I love the whole thing.  I think it's genious.  I think that Peter Billingsley plays the part of Ralphie to perfection.  He is believeable as the slightly nerdy, slightly average boy who enrolls in the Little Orphan Annie Secret Society decades before that would have been considered majorly \"uncool\".  And when the family fights over who's gonna be Santa, rips into the Christmas presents in their jammies and then share wine while looking at the tattered wrapping paper...well, it takes me back to my OWN childhood, which I feel blessed was very special and endearing (yet far from perfect).  However, I'm a student nurse and fairly well-adjusted, so I'd like to think that my parents did a dandy job.  And when Ralphie's dad surprises him with the gun....that scene is priceless because COUNTLESS other children have been suprised by their fun-loving dads and the magic of Santa, too.  And it takes THEM back.A Christmas Story is a wonderful film for the WHOLE family.  People, life is NOT perfect.  Get over yourselves.  Have fun and grab yourselves a heavily spiked egg nog before laughing yourself silly...especially if this is the first time you've seen this Christmas gem that will forever be my favorite holiday film.\n",
      "Always a fantastic classic! Love this family movie. I still can't read fragile without saying it the \"french way\" !\n",
      "So funny and it brings back memories of my own childhood, although I'm only 45. Some things transcend time. I've watched this movie over and over and over again...every year at Christmas and it never gets old. As a matter of fact, when watching it again this year at Christmas (2009), I spotted something that I've never noticed before. Seems to be that way ever year, which helps to keep it fresh and entertaining. Movie is not a small child movie, but definitely made for teens and adults. Highly recommend purchasing it. Enjoy!\n",
      "A good product, very good image quality, good audio, recommended.the product was tightly closed with a good presentation. perfect!!\n",
      "my dad wanted a copy of this classic and i found the best price right here.  well done and i will look here again when shopping for movies.\n",
      "A great trip down memory lane. First for me because I was young in those years and secondly, when I took my 5 year old son to see it he thought I was a knee-slapper. Fond memories for all.\n",
      "The best!!! My family and I enjoy watching this movie a lot, eve when is not Christmas.. I want to visit the house!!\n",
      "I bought this for my six year old twin grandsons.  The first day, we watched it three times.  After they went to sleep, I watched the discussion and interview with the now grownup 'Ralphie'.  A must have in your Christmas movie collection.\n",
      "Unsentimental Christmas story is quite unusual and enjoyable.  Funny in a non-Lampoonish way.  Also, have a dog named Ralphie who is the BEST.\n",
      "I have to at lease watch this movie every December..late at night with a mug of Hot chocolate to get me the holiday spirit.\n",
      "Tis is one you can show year after year--a part of the Christmas tradition in ur family.  A chuckle a minute!\n",
      "My family has enjoyed this movie for years.  We even have Christmas ornaments that go with this movie.  It was time to replace the VHS with a Blu-ray edition.  Thanks!\n",
      "It has become a family tradition to watch \"A Christmas Story\" on Thanksgiving day.  We enjoy it and never grow tired of watching it.\n",
      "It's one of the best Christmas movies for bringing back childhood memories.  The clarity and sound quality on my Kindle Fire HD8.9\" is fantastic!!\n",
      "Turned on while opening presents, etc.; got  bunch of laughs from the kids; parents enjoyed the \"nostaligia\" feeling from Christmas' past and the clean viewing.\n",
      "My family of four children and husband use to watch this every Christmas.  Now they're all gone and my husband have continued watching it and enjoy it every year.  A few cuss words but not any that we thought were too bad for our family to watch.\n",
      "It came fast and on time like they had promised. The only thing was when I opened it the outside packaging on the dvd case had a hole in it, however I checked the disc and it was ok no scratches or anything so I kept it. Great film, a classic.\n",
      "A Christmas Story is fun to watch.  I always enjoy watching it every year on tv.  Now I can watch it anytime.\n",
      "Gotta love this movie.  I loved it as a kid and my kids love it now.  This movie is a classic!\n",
      "The first time I watched in TV and was able to see at small part.... I thought someone wrote my life story...and could not stop laughing.  Was happy to see the whole STORY from beginning to end\n",
      "One of the best classics out there!!!  I highly recommend this one if you want a movie to watch around the holiday season!\n",
      "The BD came up great on this classic Xmas film, a film that I have pretty much memorized at this point.If you've only seen this movie as part of the \"24 Hours of...\" broadcast on TBS every Christmas Eve/Day, you owe it to yourself to see it in this GREAT print, uninterrupted by commercial breaks and blaring through your stereo speakers like you were in a movie theater.The BD includes both the widescreen and full screen versions of the movie. I prefer the widescreen myself (though you can watch the full screen version just to see the trampoline that Black Bart uses to jump the fence and mount his horse as he flees the imagined wrath of Ralphie's blue-steel beauty - the trampoline isn't visible in the WS version).This CE also contains a set of Leg Lamp lights to hang on your Xmas tree.Highly recommended.\n",
      "Great family movie. My grandkids love it. Hard to find a movie these days that you can let the little kids watch and not have to worry about inappropriate content.\n",
      "Great family movie.  Brought back memories of growing up.  the cookie cutters and apron are a great edition as well as the story book that comes with.\n",
      "This movie has it all and is fulling of surprises, no matter how many times u watch it! Truly gets better as the years pass.\n",
      "We love this movie it takes me back to when I was a kid.  Good quality recording and was packaged perfectly.\n",
      "It's the Christmas experience every Boomer has had and which every Boomer's kid has had to listen being recounted. This warm and charming movie saves our increasingly short breath by telling everybody how it was with remarkable clarity and emotional authenticity. Wonderful!\n",
      "Very pleased with the prompt shipment and the quality of the video.  Would not hesitate to order again from this vender.\n",
      "A perfect Christmas story about an imperfect Christmas. Stays a fresh story year after year. Fun movie to watch every Christmas. Great tradition.\n",
      "I love watching this movie as it is good for several hardy laughs. Several scenes remind me of my own childhood.  Especially decoder rings!\n",
      "Got great service and shipping time from this vendor.  What a great time of the year to buy Christmas video stuff the price was very reasonable.\n",
      "I have had this movie on DVD for years.  We watch it as a family every year at Christmas.  I have been looking for this disc at a low price to replace the DVD version.  I found this movie in a bluray format that was at a great price.  The movie arrived early and the disc and contents were in like new conditon.  A excellent vendor who will get my business again!\n",
      "The wish of every boy, a red rider special.Family oriented classic for the holidays, I wasn't going to write a review being most everyone has seen this classic; however, no one backs down from a triple dog dare.\n",
      "Haven't watched it yet but I know the story and love it.  Anxious to see it on the blu ray player I ordered !!!!\n",
      "This movie has a cult following that is well deserved. Hilariously funny that supplies endless quotes. Grab some popcorn and settle in.\n",
      "I don't know how I missed seeing this movie sooner, it is now one of my Christmas favorites! It really tickles my funny one. Laughed all the way through.\n",
      "It doesn't get any better than this comedy from a kids point of view that takes those of us that were raised in the 40s and 50s back to our childhood including bullies and favorite radio shows whether we grew up in upstate Indiana or not.  Truly a Christmas classic.\n",
      "LOVE THIS MOVIE....A HOLIDAY CLASSIC!Recommend it for every family.You definitely should have in in your permanent Christmas movie collection.\n",
      "It was great to finally purchase this DVD for both of my children. It's our favorite Christmas movie by far.\n",
      "One of the new Christmas classics!!  It's a must twenty-four hour marathon right along side It's a Wonderful Life!  Fra-gi-le!\n",
      "I love this little movie...so cute and so much fun to watch. A totally different time in America...Love all the actors!\n",
      "I actually bought this Christmas present for myself and I just loved it.  I always heard about it from other people but never saw it.  I love Christmas CD's and have quite a collection for me  to watch during a free time I have during the day.  I watch these throughout the year as I will do this CD.\n",
      "My family and I have watched this movie every Christmas. The film and story is beautiful. The story of young Ralphie during 1940's Christmas. To be played in a 24 hour marathon on TBS is a little excessive but it gives us a chance to watch the movie as a backdrop to Christmas parties. The dvd has some nice editions to it. The special features are fun.My 83 year old father remembers a lot of this movies references; i.e. the Red Ryder BB gun (his mother wouldn't let him have one for the same reasons as Ralphie), the Lone Ranger, Little Orphan Annie radio show, and Ovaltine.I like this movie because it's a family theme story. Ralphie and his family's ups and downs during Christmas kind of reminds of my family. Ralphie's friends are familiar to the kids I knew at that age. The triple-dog dares were big at my mom's age, grandparents and myself. The \"profanity\" is both funny and reminder to all the names my sister and I said (\"ass-tronaut,\" \"h e double hockey sticks\" and of course \"fudge\").This is a true classic Christmas movie that will always be a tradition to be watched in my family.\n",
      "I received the DVD promptly and it was in great shape.Thank you so much!\n",
      "This is a Christmas movie we watch every year, I grew up in this generation and can so relate to everything Ralphy goes through. Love seeing the small parts that were edited out of the TV version. A great traditional movie\n",
      "Very good movie. From the 40's./we watched it an laughed. you will too. So get the movie. Counting words now?\n",
      "It is the best Xmas movie ever made, appeals to all ages.  It's a Christmas morningtradition at our home,\n",
      "I've watched many Christmas \"specials\" over the years and this has to be one of the very best! What a typically dysfunctional American family working out the kinks of its Christmas confusion is ironically a delightful story! Gotta love it!\n",
      "Bought several for family memories and they loved it overall.  It was delivered quickly and with no problems.  Very funny movie for my entire family to watch together.\n",
      "I love this movie because it is not all sticky sweet. To me, it is entertaining because it is more real than most Christmas Movies.\n",
      "Great story and a must to add to your collection of Christmas movies unless you feel like watching it on repeat Christmas morning on your local TV channel.\n",
      "This is such a great addition to any Christmas movie collection. It's such a classic and I love this movie!\n",
      "The original,  still the best Christmas movie of all time. So many classic scenes if you haven't watched this movie yet you missing out.\n",
      "I wanted this movie to watch before they show it 24 straight stating christmas eve. What can I say, it's a dvd.\n",
      "I watch this once a year.  Somehow I'm always surprised by the number of hysterical lines in the movie.  My favorite this year... \"Why are you crying?\" \"Cause Daddy's going to kill Ralphy!\"\n",
      "I went to see this movie because CROSS CREEK, which was supposed to be the big holiday movie of 1983, was sold out.  I finally ran into CROSS CREEK on television a few years ago.  The photography was very nice.Actually, the  photography in this film is quite nice as well.  But the reason I remember  the film is the way that it takes the basic stuff of childhood (the  viciousness of your best friends, the intrinsic annoying-ness of you  siblings, the trench warfare that parents and chilren and husbands and  wives wage on a daily basis) and tweaks it just enough to make it funny.  There isn't a plot as such--little Ralphie Parker dreams of getting a Red  Ryder BB-gun for Christmas, and this is the thread on which Bob Clark (who  also directed) and Jean Shepherd (on whose novel IN GOD WE TRUST--ALL  OTHERS PAY CASH the film is based) string a series of vignettes about  Ralphie's friends and family, from poor Flick getting his tongue stuck to a  frozen pole to Mom \"accidentally\" breaking the woman's-leg lamp  that Dad won in a contents and insists on displaying in the front window.  The film is also helped by the pitch-perfect casting; Darren McGavin as The  Old Man, all raging, frustrated id, Melinda Dillon as Mother, a sweet,  rational woman in general, but given to moments of eccentric outrage, and  Peter Billingsly as Ralphie--a marvelous combination of unaffected  youthfulness and shrewd comic timing (you can believe that this kid would  grow up to be somebody smart like Jean Shepherd).And best of all,  despite the wonderful period details in the sets and costumes, this isn't a  nostalgic film; the script and the performances always cut the sugar with  plenty of vinegar--which makes the whole thing that much tastier . . .\n",
      "This movie remains so fresh with each viewing, it is easy to forget that it is almost twenty years old.  Told from Ralphie's viewpoint, these are the Christmas reminiscences of an adult whose pre-teen Christmas wish is a BB-gun that adults discouraged with the phrase \"You'll shoot your eye out.\"In his quest to convince his parents that he is old enough to have a BB-gun, young Ralphie hatches several plots, including writing the best \"What I Want for Christmas\" essay in his class, being leaving BB-gun ads in conspicuous places, and, as a last resort, asking Santa Claus. (Parents with young sons, beware: you may want to delay purchasing this film until you are ready to deal with a similar request.)Told in episodic fashion, there are many vignettes which stand out: Ralphie wearing Aunt Martha's Christmas present, visiting Santa Claus and helping his father change a flat-tire come to mind immediately.  Exaggerated acting, distorted camera angles, and day-dream sequences all enhance the child's viewpoint, but do not detract from the film's excellent portrayal of 1950's small-town Christmas ritual.Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin have a tongue-in-cheek style as Ralphie's parents.  Peter Billingsley has just the right pre-teen balance between adorable and obnoxious, and Ian Petrella is downright irritating as baby brother Randy.  Among the smaller roles, Zack Ward is perfect as the clay-footed bully and Tedde Moore excellent as Ralphie's kind, but practical teacher.  (Jean Shepherd, the author and narrator of the film makes a cameo appearance standing in line, waiting for Santa.)This is one to enjoy each Christmas.\n",
      "I saw this as a teenager in the theaters on a whim and was very pleasantly surprised; it has become a family tradition ever since we got it on video many years later.  Based on the works of Jean Shepard, it is very faithful to the source material (he even narrates) - even if some of the stories are not originally related to Christmas (the Bumpkiss hounds actually eat the Easter ham in Shepard's book) but as a whole the collected stories are believable, poignant, and funny.Of course, EVERYONE has seen this by now, so you know what I'm talking about.  If you're one of the 15 or so people in America who haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and correct that as soon as you can.  Also, look into getting your hands on Jean Shepard's books as well - also highly enjoyable and recommended.\n",
      "this movie is truly an american classic.  this movie is, in my opinion, the best Christmas movie there is out there today, and probably ever will be.\n",
      "One of my favorite Christmas (or any other time) movies.  Glad I will be able to watch it anytime I want and not just when the 24 hour marathons run.\n",
      "I won't even bother reviewing the film itself: it's a modern classic & everyone who is reading this has probably seen it a few dozen times.  What I will review are the extras to this 20th anniversary 2-disc special edition.You'd think after twenty years the producers would have a boat-load of extras to offer.  If not that then a large assortment of cast & crew members onhand to create an interesting retrospective documentary.What we get instead is a 20 minute reflection by a few of the cast members (the now grown up actors who portrayed Ralphie, Schwartz, Flick, & Scott Farkus, as well as director Bob \"Porky's\" Clark) called Another Christmas Story that seemed to have been thrown together in one afternoon.  Where's Melinda Dillon?  Where's Darren McGavin?  And where's the kid who played Randy (who, might I add, looks NOTHING like he did in 1983.  I saw a photo of him somewhere & he looks disheveled & totally washed up).  This \"reflection\" just features the five guys rattling off a few ordinary memories of their experience (They didn't think it was going to be a huge success [who ever does?]; The kids played pranks while they stayed in a hotel; etc.  Wow.  The insights are killing me).  It's not really informative.  Nor is it fun to watch.Although I want to point out that Scottie Schwartz- porn star extraordinaire- looks creepily the same as he did in 1983.  He's just pudgier & has a goatee.  And Zack \"Scott Farkus\" Ward (who you'll recognize from TV's recent Titus) is incredibly obnoxious.  He's constantly hamming it up, which seems to be encouraged by the not-at-all-funny Pop-Up Video style production features.  Yeech.The PG-commentary (by actor Peter Billingsley & director/writer Bob Clark) fares a little better.  Not the best commentary ever recorded, but it gives the film a fresh viewing (I must have seen the film like, 700 times).The rest of this special edition's features go way downhill:  There's the Triple Dog Dare trivia game (which features the above mentioned interview participants reading the questions... clearly taped right after giving the interview); Radio readings by author Jean Sheppard, which are interesting, but a tad on the long [read: tedious] side; a stupid decoder game (does anyone really needs this?); etc.  It's your typical DVD special edition filler [...].The most annoying extra (besides Zack Ward's testimonials) is the featurette on the company that makes the leg lamps.  The \"correspondent\" (I forget his name) gives his worst Daily Show knock-off in what is perhaps the most embarrassing and unfunny segment my eyeballs have witnessed.  This has to be seen to be believed.  Though you'll want your 3 minutes back immediately after viewing it.I still recommend getting this DVD over the other standard version.  The packaging is nice.  The film is naturally classic.  The commentary is vaguely interesting.  But the extras are weak... really weak... and had so much potential.\n",
      "Christmas would not be complete without Ralphie and his pursuit of a BB gun.  I thoroughly enjoy the ride every year.\n",
      "Very well done.  Brings back the spirit of Christmas and is heart warming and funny.  This film makes me forget about the commercialism there is today that seems to start at the end of September and takes me back in time where on December 1st it was time to start thinking about Santa, Christmas Carols, visits from family and finding our special tree.  It's in my 'must see every year' category just like the Sound Of Music.\n",
      "I just compared the letterboxed laserdisc version of this film to the dvd full screen version of this film. The laserdisc version does nothing more than add black bars to the top and bottom of what you see on the dvd version. In other words...the top and bottom parts of the film are cut out on the laserdisc version. I noticed this with the dvd letterbox and full screen laserdisc version of \"When Harry Met Sally.\" It appears you are actually not missing any part of the picture on this dvd version of this movie. I just completed a side-by-side comparison ofboth versions and this is what I ended up with. So...go ahead and buy this version and you'll be just fine. You needn't worry about missing any part of the film as far as the original theatrical aspect of this film is concerned.  A handful of film directors do this (James Cameron has done this with \"The Abyss\") because they are aware the film will eventually end up on television, so they will shoot the film as if shooting for a television release.  When the film is first released in theaters they simply add black bars to the top and bottom of the film to make it appear widescreen.  When it plays on tv the black bars are simply removed and you get the full screen version with none of the picture removed thus eliminating the necessity for pan-and-scanning; you actually get more picture information then the theatrical release.\n",

Mind you, the 50's was a time where people didn't have to be as worried about guns, and these times are bygone. No Internet, no TV, chalkboards with real chalk instead of dry-erase boards, and so on and so forth...This movie is entertaining because of its well-written story, but it's also awesome for nostalgia.\n",

My children in their late 30's still remember seeing this as kids and can still quote the main lines.  I don't need or want to see a sad, sentimental movie to get the idea of the season.  This is a great movie to remind of us all the things in our lives and to look at them with a great sense of humor.  It is the best.\n",

      "*** Edited 2003-12-18: ***I love this movie.  My initial (1-star) review was in the year 2000, for the lousy old 1-disc release, which had horrible picture quality.  Don't get that one!  But the new \"Two-Disc Special Edition\" DVD set of this movie is very good, get that one!!\n",
      "Personally I think this is the antithesis of how a child feels about Christmas!  And being from a child's point of view, why it is precious!  It never failed, whatever I wanted my parents, teachers, etc, etc, etc thought  it was unnecessary or just plain out dangerous.The first time I saw this  movie, I was skeptical.  My mother told me I'd love it and anytime she  tells me that, I usually squirm away in horror.  But she was right!  This  movie makes me belly laugh about so many things!  And Flick... What a  dunderhead!  Who'd put his tongue on a frozen flagpole!I love the  whole movie down to the Bumpass's dogs and the stolen Turkey episode to the  \"Butterfinger\" to the gruesome Santa!  And that teacher makes  Cruella DeVille look like a saint!\n",
      "The 1983 film, \"A Christmas Story\", quickly became a holiday classic as viewers fell in love with its witty prose as narrated by Jean Shepherd (1921-1999), who wrote the novel upon which the film is based: \"In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash\".The film begins weeks before Christmas in the city of Terre Haute, Indiana circa 1934.  A young Ralph 'Ralphie' Parker (Peter Billingsley) stares through the glass of a storefront window at the local department store to see what he wants most for Christmas, a Red Rider Be-Be Gun, and ponders the quandary of how to convince his parents to buy him one.  He leaves various clues in the house for his parents to find about how wonderful and necessary the be-be gun is, but when his mother (Melinda Dillon, who received Oscas nominations for her roles in the 1977 film \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" and the 1981 film \"Absence of Malice\") asks him what he wants for Christmas during breakfast one morning, Ralphie excitedly blurts out, \"I want an official, Red Ryder, Carbine-action, 200-Shot, Range Model, Air Rifle\".  His mother responds, \"No, that's too dangerous. You'll shoot your eye out.\"  Ralphie is crushed at hearing the common adult \"prejudice\" against the be-be gun, but decides upon finding another tactical means of persuasion.At school, Ralphie's teacher, Miss Shields, (Tedde Moore) assigns his class to write a Christmas theme. Most of the students are not happy with the assignment, but Ralphie sees this as another golden opportunity to bolster the superiority of the Red Rider be-be gun as the ideal Christmas gift.  He writes what he believes will be regarded a masterpiece, but when Miss Shields returns his theme, Ralphie is shocked to see a grade of \"C+\". To add insult to injury, Miss Shields writes in red ink, \"You'll shoot your eye out!\"  For Ralphie, the universe is coming apart at the seams and it leads to one of the film's many subplots: a fight with the bully Scut Farcus (Zach Ward).  Throughout the first half of the film, Ralphie, his younger brother Randy (Ian Petrella) and his two friends Flick (Scott Schwartz) and Schwartz (R.D. Robb) are terrorized by Scut Farcus and his toady Grover Dill (Yano Anaya).  Upon receiving a C+ for his prized theme, Ralphie's rage empowers him to mercilessly beat upon the unexpecting Scut Farcus and to express his Red Rider frustration in a torrent of obscenities (don't worry, they're unintelligible).  Fearing a severe punishment from his father (Darren McGavin, well-known for his characterization of Carl Kolchak in the 1972 TV-series \"The Night Stalker\"), Ralphie & Randy tearfully wait for their father to return home from work; but their mother plays down the fight in a conversation with him to Ralphie's relief.Ralphie's father is a fascinating character in the film with several great subplots: his unintelligible expressions of frustration with the neighbor's uncontrolled pack of dogs and struggles with their failing furnace, and his winning of a \"major prize\".  Ralphie's mother isn't too thrilled with her husband's \"major prize\" since it is a tall plastic lamp in the shape of a woman's leg wearing a black-lace stocking that he proudly displays in front of their livingroom window; but a mysterious and unexplained accident changes the sitation.Other subplots in the film include Ralphie's \"Little Orphan Annie Secret Society Decoder Ring\", Ralphie assiting his father change a flat tire with unforeseen consequences, Schwartz challenging Flick to stick his tongue to a frozen flagpole to see whether it will get stuck, the discovery of Chinese turkey and the frequent overheating of inadequate electrical fuses and outlets in the Parker's home.Jean Shepherd's narration throughout the film binds all of the many subplots into a coherent whole that continues to delight viewers of all ages to its timeless humor and realism.  Though the film itself gets 5 stars, DVD quality is far less than it what it could have been, as other reveiwers have remarked.  The DVD is full-screen instead of widescreen and there is little bonus material offered.  I highly recommend to Warner Studios that this film be digitally remastered in widescreen format and include additional bonus material, such as a biography of Jean Shepherd.Though the DVD quality is low for \"A Christmas Story\", the film itself is well worth the purchase of the full-screen DVD.  This is a film that can be enjoyed at any time of the year, but especially during the holidays.  Watch and see whether Ralphie will ever get his beloved, official, Red Ryder, Carbine-action, 200-Shot, Range Model, Air Rifle!\n",
      "A Great Movie for Christmas for the Family. My 22 year old daughter has been obsessed with the movie for as long as I can remember. She is in Florida and her DVD was taken so I sent her a new one. One Happy Girl\n",
      "One of the best movie's ever made. If you have never seen this one it is a hoot, it's just good clean fun for the entire family. I watch this every Christmas and even sometimes in between the holiday's too. So pop some popcorn and sit back with the entire family to bring back memory's of your youth or to make new one's with your family.\n",
      "A classic!  I am a cordcutter, and at the holidays the only thing I miss TBS running this movie for 24 hours straight.  We'll I rented it from Amazon, problem solved!  Easily my favorite Christmas movie.\n",
      "Twenty years after its initial release, \"A Christmas Story\" remains one of the most heartwarming, human and enjoyable Yuletide tales ever.  The casting of Peter Billingsley, Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin was truly inspired and are at the heart of this classic.  Billingsley's unabashed imagination, his wide-eyed awe of all that goes on around him, his desire to get that beebee gun, and his joyous love of life is one of the best children's performances on celluloid.  Melinda Dillon's Mom is a joy to behold---witness how she gets little Randy to eat his mashed potatoes and meatloaf--what a marvelous performance she gives--her love and admiration for her husband and children is evidenced in so many sublte ways and Dillon captures and embodies the wonder of motherhood.  McGavin, needless to say, is awesome.  Childlike, foul-mouthed, but the biggest kid in the movie.  This movie alone shows what an underappreciated and fine actor Mr. McGavin is.Christmas' true meaning and its simplicity and joy have not been captured any more effectively in this Christmas gem.Have yourself a merry little Christmas and watch this one every year!\n",
      "I don't know how long it took this film to become a Christmas classic, but it has certainly earned the title.  If I were to pick only 3 movies to own with a Christmas theme, it would be \"A Christmas Story\", \"Rudolph and the Island of Misfit Toys\" and \"Frosty the Snowman\".  It brings something to the table for all ages.  This is one of the great films, and cannot be missed.\n",
      "A wonderful companion to the new Broadway musical.Too bad it can't be seen by everyone.Hopefully, it will tour\n",
      "A Great Movie to watch each Christmas or anytime you need to Laugh. Those of us over 60 can certainly identify with life as depicted in the movie.\n",
      "This is my favorite Christmas movie...of them all.... and in this newly released HD DVD, it is even better!!!  It didn't look this good in the theatre.  It fills the screen of my 16 by 9 Sony LCD.  Warners is doing a magnificent job with these HD DVDs!!!!Soft, almost 40's or 50's image (but much shaper than privious releases).Outstanding image quality.  It appears to have been restored. Glorious images!!!!  HD is a giant leap forward.If you love this film and have an HD DVD Player, it's a must!\n",
      "I Love this Movie, it is one of my Very favs. 4 the Holidays, Thank you for your great service BTW!!! Happy Holidays.Michael Moore\n",
      "My all time favorite movie.  It is both funny and warm and takes me back to a kinder simpler time.  Of course we get to watch it for 24 consecutive hours at Christmas time and it has become a wonderful Holiday tradition but every now and then it would be so nice have it available to experience during the year.  Well now I can and recently did with my Grandson who seemed also to be touched by the magic of this movie.  I think he is now a fan.\n",
      "By far the funniest Christmas movie ever.  Totally captures the childhood joys of Christmas along with all the inner workings of a childs mind.  AWESOME!!!!\n",
      "Easily one of the best movies ever made....especially that the entire family can watch.  A snapshot into a time when the world was a much simpler, and probably happier place.\n",
      "I'm no movie critic, so my review won't be profound nor long. This movie is truly wonderful in its truth and simplicity.  I am a fifty-one year old man who grew up geographically, culturally, and time-period wise, parallel  with Ralphie, the central character and 1st person narrator of the movie.  And, I remember well what it was like to be nine years old then and there.  The pain, the fears, the frustrations, the unknowingness, the dreams and  hopes are all so real yet so incredibly funny.  Anyone who has livied  within a large family will recognize the Xmas scenes where the neighborhood  dogs enter the house and carry away the Xmas turkey and how the family is  forced to have Xmas dinner in a Chinese restaurant with the restaurant  staff attempting to sing Xmas carols with their delightfully funny Chinese  accent.  Culturally, in the midwest in the late forties and early fifties,  only a Chinese restaurant could be found open in a small midwest town on  Xmas Day.I recommend this movie to anyone who ever was a young boy or  who knows a young boy.  It is delightful!\n",
      "We watch it every year.  We love the characters and the story and the setting.  It's got some great bits, and classic stuff like the lamp and the bunny suit and the Red Ryder BB gun.  Never gets tired...\n",
      "A few days before Christmas I watched \"A Christmas Story\" for about the 15th time as my wife and I have made this a yearly ritual.  The funny scenes are numerous and still tickled my ribs, particularly:1.  Ralphie dressed as a deranged Easter bunny or a pink nightmare as defined by his father.2.  Flick getting his tongue stuck to a frozen flag pole.3.  The duck getting its head chopped off at the Chinese restuarant.4.  The Bumpus' dogs destroying the much coveted Christmas turkey dinner which led to the Chinese restuarant scene.5.  Ralphie's mother getting the younger brother to eat his mashed potatoes by getting him to pretend he was a pig at an eating trough.6.  Ralphie beating the living daylights out of the bully Scott Farcus (sic?).7.  The impatient Santa Claus and elves at the department store who terrorized the kids.8.  Ralphie's dad's winning the tacky leg lamp.The movie is a great story about Christmas time in the Midwest in a simpler era (I guess the 1950s or so) and the small town values that many today yearn for.  The movie still entertains and teaches good values without demeaning the true meaning of Christmas without being politically correct (i.e. - singing Christmas carols about Jesus Christ during an opening scene, closing the movie with Ralphie's parents snuggling up on a couch on Christmas night to the tune of Silent Night).The only reason I did not give the movie 5 stars was the cussing (of which there was too much for my taste).  I believe the cursing could have either been totally deleted or muffled so the audience could not discern what was being said (as in the father battling the broken furnace scene - wish there could have been more of that).  I understand it is now possible to have your dvd or video doctored to where the cussing can be deleted and we may indeed do that.  I realize this sounds prudish to some, but we do have children.Complaint aside, I do recommend the movie as a Christmas classic.  Enjoy and cover up your ears when the cussing scenes come up!\n",
      "I love this movie!  A favorite of mine for the holidays!  I find that it is awesome it is now on blu-ray.  However, the special features are not subtitled.  :(  At least the movie is!!\n",
      "This has become a holiday tradition througout my extended family.  This is one of those movies that gets better every time you watch it.  Love this movie!\n",
      "I have loved this movie ever since I first saw it.  It's one of the first videos I ever bought.  This movie has captured how it feels to be a kid--dealing with bullies, friends' dares, little brothers, Christmas anticipation, teachers, broken glasses, disappointments, and fear of your dad when you're in trouble.  Some things never change, I guess.  I love Ralph's daydreams, his whiny little brother Randy who won't eat unless he can be a pig, and the pink bunny pajamas from Ralph's aunt Clara who \"had for years not only perpetually labored under the delusion that [Ralph is] 4 years old, but also a girl.\"Oh Fudge, wash my mouth out with soap (but please don't use LifeBouy)!  There are a few bad words in the movie, but not many.  It's limited to a couple of S.O.B.'s and a couple of smart-a**es.  Most of the bad language in the movie is simulated.  Because Ralphie's father swears all the time, Ralphie learns to swear.  I think that is a good lesson for everyone.  And who has not at least wanted to beat up a bully?As a mother, I can understand the \"irrational prejudice against Red Ryder and his Peacemaker\".  What I can't understand is the few people with irrational prejudice against this movie.  It's just as cute as can be.  See it with your family.  I think just about everyone will enjoy it.\n",
      "I love, love, love this movie. I watch it year round & non stop on Christmas Eve & Christmas Day. My 4 & 5 year old autistic grandchildren are enthralled with this movie.I can identify with the time period, so it's nostalgia seeing how my Christmases were back in the day. My grandmother had the same type of kitchen sink & washing machine. We would go downtown to see all the stores decorated & visit with Santa.Ralph is a junior Walter Mitty with all his daydreams/fantasies.Love the Old Man [who later will be Karl Kolcheck, The Night Stalker]. The mom is overworked & overtired in her \"traditional\" role as homemaker.There are just too many favorite scenes to mention. Ralphie's big blue eyes filling with tears & then - he attacks the bully. Yeah, we cheer him on. The bar of soap in Ralph's mouth for swearing. I used all those soaps mentioned & had a couple put into my mouth as well. Grandma didn't mess around.The kicker scene is Santa saying, \"you'll shoot your eye out kid\", & pushing an open mouthed, shocked & shattered Ralph down the slide with his foot. Ralph thought that only Santa would understand & could help him get his Red Ryder BB gun.Watching this movie, it's like I'm being hugged by my grandmother & what I wouldn't give to have that happen right now.I don't know how popular this movie is with the younger generations, but this movie resonates to my core.\n",
      "I love using amazon to buy movies i never have a problem with streaming etc. This movie is classic, we watch it every year, it's hilarious and clean\n",
      "This is a wonderful, funny and in my opinion very warm family film. As a parent I know what it feels like to get my child the one gift that makes that Christmas magical. The look of joy and delight on the fathers face when Ralphie opens his much hoped for gift often brings tears to my eyes. I have read several reviews which mention foul language, I have to set the record straight...there is no foul language in this film. What these people are refering to is the mumbling of nonsense words used in place of cussing &#^%$*#$!!! (oops hope I didn't offend anyone!!). I respect a parents right to restrict their children's viewing if they feel the material is unfit, but I can't imagine how sheltered a child must be if their parents will not allow this movie.\n",
      "My family and I have watched this movie every Christmas.  The film and story is beautiful.  The story of young Ralphie during 1940's Christmas.  To be played in a 24 hour marathon on TBS is a little excessive but it gives us a chance to watch the movie as a backdrop to Christmas parties.  The dvd has some nice editions to it.  The special features are fun.My 83 year old grandfather remembers a lot of this movies references; i.e. the Red Ryder BB gun (his mother wouldn't let him have one for the same reasons as Ralphie), the Lone Ranger, Little Orphan Annie radio show, and Ovaltine.I like this movie because it's a family theme story.  Ralphie and his family's ups and downs during Christmas kind of reminds of my family.  Ralphie's friends are familiar to the kids I knew at that age.  The triple-dog dares were big at my mom's age, grandparents and myself.  The \"profanity\" is both funny and reminder to all the names my sister and I said (\"ass-tronaut,\" \"h e double hockey sticks\" and of course \"fudge\").This is a true classic Christmas movie that will always be a tradition to be watched in my family.\n",
      "Christmas family classic.  Awesome narrative .. happy happy happy happy happy happy happy holiday holiday holiday holiday Christmas time classic\n",
      "\"You'll shoot your eye out, kid.\"With those six simple words not only were dreams of an Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle altered forever, so were the normal holiday movie traditions of Americans across the country. As popular as this feature is today, this did not take hold until quite recently. When A Christmas Story opened in theaters back in 1983, the studio that produced the film had no confidence in it, thus launching the film in only 886 theaters. By the end of its run, the film pulled in a disappointing $19 million and its television rights had been sold off quickly without a second thought. It wasn't until the TNT television network began to offer numerous viewings of the classic holiday comedy over the festive season did the film begin to finally be accepted by the masses. Now A Christmas Story has joined the ranks of such other yuletide treasures as It's a Wonderful Life and A Charlie Brown Christmas as a true staple of this special time of year.The story fellows the adventures of a young boy set against the Christmas holiday in the 1940's as he dreams of the perfect holiday gift. Ralphie Parker is like any other typical young boy in the 1940's but there is something that does set him apart from the rest of the pack. His aspirations for an Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle, the one item that he believes to be the perfect Christmas present. Unfortunately for young Ralphie, he faces stern opposition from his mother who believes the toy will \"shoot his eye out\". He receives no help from his father who is too busy holding off the Bumbus hounds or shouting at the furnace, so Ralphie seeks to find higher help for his cause, the big man himself: Santa Claus. But even this last splint of hope is dashed to pieces with those devastating words coming from the \"jolly\" fat man himself, \"You'll shoot your eye out, kid.\" All hope seems lost for poor Ralphie but if only he knew what Christmas Day would bring! The plot for A Christmas Story is one of the most wonderful concepts ever attempted in a holiday feature film and what makes it so memorable is the fact that many elements, no matter how elaborated, can be related by one family or another in some point in their lives.The biggest highlight of the comedy has to be how each character is cast perfectly. Peter Billingsley, who takes on the role of Ralph Parker, showcases a delightful performance despite his relatively young age. Many of the funniest moments of the feature come from his reactions alone to certain situations. Melinda Dillion gives a wonderful if not eerily familiar performance of Ralphie's typical 1940's mother. She works perfectly opposite Darren McGavin especially over the battle of the broken leg lamp. McGavin more then likely outshines them all with his over-the-top performance as Ralphie's Old Man. His shoutings of \"Don't anybody move!\" and \"Notafinga!\" will likely stand the test of theatrical comedic time but it is his overall good fatherly nature that makes every audience member feel as if they are witness a part of their own familiar past. Though he is not remembered by his name, Jeff Gillen does a hilarious take on the mall-Santa, stingy elfs and all. And Jean Shepard, who wrote the book on which this film is based on, gives a perfect off-beat narration of the film with perfect tones and comments for each situation as it happens in the feature. The narration works almost as well alone as the actions performed in A Christmas Story.Overall, Can the Christmas season be fully complete without at least one viewing of A Christmas Story? You can try but all bets are that even the \"Grinchiest\" person can't escape the irresistible personality of this yuletide comedy. There are so many wonderful things going for this film that it is hard to pick out the flaws. If anything, the last portion of A Christmas Story tends to drag a little bit near the end unlike earlier parts where actions were performed in a much quicker pace. In a way like Christmas Vacation, many of the elements within A Christmas Story connect with someone at one point or another based on their own Christmas experiences with their family. Though some would not like to admit some of the more embarrassing memories (aka looking like a pink nightmare on Christmas morning), we can all relate to young Ralphie's blight of getting the perfect Christmas gift when we were his age. But in the end, we realize that family, no matter how embarrassing or bumbling they may be, is what is the most important during the holidays. That is one memory that we should always keep close to our hearts no matter what time of the year.\n",
      "Charming, funny, and entertaining film about a boys memory of his favorite Christmas.  Daren McGavin gives a great performance as the contest entry obsessed father.\n",
      "This is a true American Christmas classic. I watched it every Christmas season for years and now own my own copy so I can enjoy it at other times too! It is soooo funny!\n",
      "For every season, there is a classic movie.  In our house, \"A Christmas Story\" tops the list when Christmas rolls around.  Without a doubt this movie is a classic!  Ralphie and his quest for the Red Ryder BB gun -- I do love this movie.\n",

      "I had it on VHS back in the 90's and used to watch it as a kid all the time. Fans of this movie know that TNT plays it 24hrs straight every xmas day. I saw this movie and yes I wanted a red rider BB gun. Great movie and a must own!\n",
      "It had been a while since I saw this movie, now I remember why it is a Christmas classic.  A Christmas Story brings back the memories of being home for Christmas as a kid. This was one of the regular movies that would play on cable during the week leading up to Christmas.  With Amazon, I was able to share it with my family as well.  Add it to the holiday line up of Charlie Brown's Christmas, Frosty the Snowman, Miracle on 34 Street, Rudolph the Red Nosed Raindeer, and Home Alone and you have hours of entertainment from Amazon.\n",
      "Loved this movie as a kid nowMy kids do as well. Got here onTime well package. Must buy for kidsof all ages.\n",

      "This by far is one of the best family fun filled movies ive seen for a holiday c-mas film~Its one the entire family can watch & i watch it each year on tv till i decided to purchase it~As all the good & older movies are fading awayPeter Billingsly has by now has grown up into a handsome young man & was the cutest child along w/his adorable lil brother, cantakerous father & timid mother portrayed in the storyline.The high jinx never stops all the way up to a hilarious ending~A MUST SEE!!!\n",
      "This movie never gets old when its xmas time....I love all the characters especially Ralphie and Mr. Parker.  This movie should be a part of everyones xmas movie library....its a great family friendly movie.  I have bought this for gifts many times in the past...everyone loves it\n",
      "A great movie that my family adores! We watch it multiple times every Christmas season. We like this better than Rudolph.\n",
      "I love this movie it makes you laugh and cry. By the way have you ladies seen Peter Billingsley (Ralphie) lately? He is SOOOOOOOOO HOT.\n",
      "While most Christmas movies you only watch one month out of the year, this one you can watch anytime.  Definitely worth buying this seasonal classic!\n",
      "I know many people might not agree with me on this but I can't help it, I love this movie.  Yes, I know it's not A Wonderful Life but I think that is the reason why I can relate to this movie.  The family in this movie is so typical of a family in the 1940's and the moral of this story is....Mom is alway's right.  Ralphie's mom won't let him get a BB gun because she says \"you'll put your eye out\".  The whole movie is based on Ralphie trying to convince his parents, his teacher and even Santa that he does deserve a BB gun.  There are many memorable scenes to this movie but my favorite is when Ralphie says the \"F\" word.  It is hilarious because his parents, just like parents today do not realize how much of what they say is absorbed and repeated by their children.  I thought that this scene along with others just made this the funniest Christmas movie.\n",
      "Despite this shortcoming, if one can call a lack of special effects a shortcoming, this classic (adult) story from Jean Shepherd rings bells long gone rusted in the nostalgic heart. If you have a heart for the old days of the forties and fifties, this film will entrance you from the moment you hear Shepherd's voice-over narration. It's a timeless tale of simple lives at Christmas time and a family that could live on any block on Main Street, USA, only funnier.Don't be fooled by the \"kiddie\" appearance of the cover. This is definitely a story for grown ups. Today's children would not be able to relate to it, which is a shame.Bringing you back to the innocence of BB-guns and practical jokes and schoolyard bullies, this warm tale of Christmas past will make you long for the days when everyone wasn't so politically-sensitive and folks took responsibility for their own actions. The bully gets beaten up, he doesn't get \"grief counselling\".\n",
      "A CHRISTMAS STORY is a timeless holiday movie classic, right next to THE GRINCH WHO STOLE CHRISTMAS (cartoon version, movie version still good). This splendid holiday tale is about nine-year-old Ralphie's wish to get a Red Ryder BB Gun for Christmas. The little subplots: one involving the tongue stuck to the frozen pole scene; the bullies Scott Farkus and his sniveling assitant; and Ralphie's dreams of the teacher loving all his work...it's all crucial to how great this movie really is. Jean Shepherd's commentary during parts of the movie also adds to the comic splendor you'll laugh with. All the actors in this movie are terrific, especially Darren McGavin, Peter Billingsley, Melinda Dillon, and the teacher and Ralphie's brother. They show 24-hour marathons of this movie on TNT every Christmas Eve/Christmas Day...and it's easy to love this timeless classic again and again.You and your family will love this splendid tale, and may it bring warmest wishes for your holiday seasons to come! This is one Christmas classic you'll want to own.\n",
      "Yeah this is one of my favorite Christmas movies and I already pre order The HD DVD version.But I'm not sure how good it's going to look in High Def? As the DVD versions that are out right now are not the greatest in picture quality,but I'm going to get it,and I'm also planing on getting Rocky on High Def that day as well,heres hopeing these classic movies will outshine there DVD counter parts? Well anyway A Christmas Story will be masterd in High Def in 1080p,and it will include Dolby Digital plus.A Blu-Ray release will also be coming out.The Special features from the 20th Anniversary DVD will be ported over to The HD DVD and Blu-Ray version I think?\n",
      "We look forward to this film every year in our house.  Some of us have watched it since it first showed up thirty years ago and now the grandchildren are enjoying it too.\n",
      "If you're looking for a timeless and hysterical holiday flick, do yourself a favor, BUY THIS MOVIE!!  I remember growing up watching this movie during the holidays when it first reached TV in 1985.  I was five years old then and every year since have watched this movie at least once or twice during the season.  Not until two years ago, when Jean Shephed, the writer of this movie and voice of grown up Ralphie, died suddenly did I really appreciate the satyrical and amusing dialogue of the script.  Some of the most memorable quotes and funniest scenes of any holiday movie came from this flick (and I don't mean Scotty Schwartz).  \"You'll shoot your eye out\", is the most well known line, but many are much funnier.  \"They looked at me as if I had lobsters crawling out of my ears\", \"My father worked in profanity as other artists might work in oils or clay, a true master\", and \"Football?  What's a football??  My mind had gone blank!!\" are just a few of the hilarious quotes and scenes in this great Christmas masterpiece.  Since Christmas is that day in which the entire kid year revolves, this would make a great present under the tree, or an even better early Christmas Eve surprise to watch with your family.  My fiance and I watch this movie every year and laugh out loud every time.  This is the best Christmas movie or program that exists.  A Charlie Brown Christmas, Rudolph, and Garfield come close, but nothing beats Ralphie's Christmas adventure in his quest for a Red Ryder 200-shot Range Model Air Rifle!  Don't shoot your eye out!  Quick, throw this movie in your shopping cart, it's just in time for the Christmas season! (check out my other reviews of great Christmas videos and music)\n",
      "A timeless classic! From the leg lamp to the soap in the mouth, it is hilarious. I'd probably recommend it for 10+ year olds though. The language has a touch of color.\n",
      "If you're 4 to 104, it is totally enjoyable! It's a must watch each Christmas and shown on TV numerous times but this year I decided to buy my own copy.\n",
      "Every year for the past 17 years, I have sat down with my family to enjoy this film. Every year, this movie gets better and better. How can you not like it?  Told from the point of view of Ralphie, this film looks at  Christmas from a child's perspective. It shows just how strange the world  can be sometimes, and just how difficult it can be to grow up.  Parents,  bullies, and various other situations pop up during Ralphie's quest for a  BB gun for Christmas. It really makes you remember how Christmas was when  you were a kid,and despite all the quirks and discrepancies, how wonderful  it is to have a family around during that time of year. A great film that  has become a great family tradition.\n",
      "Great movie.  You'll shoot your eye out! And the Leg Lamp prize. FRAGILE. It's better than I remember. Don't forget about the tongue stuck to the flag pole!\n",
      "I finally wanted to own this movie so we have it to watch every Christmas! It was also shipped out very fast!\n",
      "We watched A Christmas Story on TV every year when it is on for 24 hours Christmas Eve through Christmas Day.  So glad we finally purchased the DVD so we can watch it before and after the Holidays whenever we want to.  LOVE IT!\n",
      "I can watch this movie with my family 100's of times. It ever gets old nor stops being hilariously funny.\n",
      "warm fuzzy funny disFUNctional family in the 40's.  the front cover does not convey that message and so I was turned off by it for years, until someone recommended it.  GREAT except for the unnecessary language by the dad person.\n",
      "if you have seen this movie before you know that you can watch it 100 * over again for Christmas Story is a classic story about Ralphie a young boy who likes adventures.\n",
      "This is hands down the best children's movie I've seen. I laughed my hind parts off. Great family movie!\n",
      "One of the all time best Christmas movies. If you grew up between the 50's and the 70's it will raise many funny memories.\n",
      "I ain't a fan of Warner Bros. remasters...so you've probably heard this is a questionable upgrade. Some hate it, some compromise.I feel that if you look at the detail in the picture, you will see its not available in the dvd versions. Not extractly a great remaster but for my prefrence, I like it. A hit and mis remaster in hi-def.Up to you if you want to upgrade to hi-def or not. It comes down to prefrence.\n",
      "Based on the highly nostalgic \"Ralphie\" stories of master humorist Jean Shepherd, \"A Christmas Story\" takes us to Holman, Indiana in the year 1940 to tell the tale of one little boy's seemingly hopeless quest to get a Red Ryder B.B. gun for Christmas. Young Ralph Parker plots tirelessly against the persistent warnings from mother, teacher, and even a nasty store Santa Claus that he'll surely just shoot his eye out! It's not a complicated plot and is full of episodic little incidents, but every moment is thoroughly enjoyable. The combination of nostalgic, relatable situations and characters and a perfectly selected cast of talents (including Kolchak the Nightstaker himself, Darren McGavin, as the Old Man), not to mention Jean Shepherd's pure brilliance (including his genius as a narrator, which he does for all the Ralphie films), make this film a true cinematic treasure. If the fact that it is one of MY favorite movies of all time isn't enough to convince you to check this one out, how about this: It is so beloved that, for years, it has been run in a 24 hour loop on cable on Christmas Eve/Day to consistently be viewed by millions of joyful fans. This low-budget (you could hardly tell), 1983 masterpiece has become a true classic and genuine phenomenon resulting in a flood of merchandise in recent years (yes, I have the action figures) as well as making the Parker family home a legitimate tourist attraction.Here, it is made available on Blu-Ray for the second time with a small assortment of extras ported over from its initial Blu-Ray release, as well as the same transfer which many were not pleased with. Personally, as someone who only owned the original DVD release before this, I'm just thrilled to have it in widescreen finally. Though, I'm disappointed to find that not all the bonus features from the previous, 20th Anniversary Blu-Ray are included on this one, especially the Jean Shepherd audio material. What we do have here is a \"documentary\" that is quite enjoyable, though it is no \"making-of\" by any means. It is really just a collection of \"looking back\" interviews with the child stars and late director Bob Clark. Also, we get an excellent audio commentary with Bob Clark and star Peter Billingsley (Ralphie). Funnily enough, just like many of the film's fans, they are not sure what year the film is set in themselves, even though you can find the year \"1940\" very clearly visible if you look in the right place (on Ralphie's decoder pin that he receives in the mail). Other bonus features include the theatrical trailer, a brief featurette on Red Ryder B.B. guns, some script pages of two deleted fantasy sequences, and a commercial for leg lamp replicas you can actually purchase. There's also a cheesy featurette called \"Get a Leg Up\", which is essentially an infomercial for the leg lamps being sold by the aforementioned commercial. I wouldn't mind getting one of these leg lamp replicas myself, but I could do without TWO commercials for them on this disc. Overall, some of the bonus features are very good, but there is a lot of missed opportunity, and why drop bonuses from the previous edition? That's a practice I'll never understand! I say get this if you don't own the movie yet, or if you only own fullscreen versions. This Blu-Ray is okay, but the movie itself is a must own. I do wish I'd gotten the previous Blu-Ray release though (with the red cover). I bought this one (white cover) somewhat blindly, because I found it at a great price and had promised myself I would finally upgrade this year from the fullscreen DVD.Now, before I end this, I want to recommend all those who find they love this film to look into the other 5 Ralphie films. Yes, 5! In fact, 3 of them predate \"A Christmas Story\". First, there was \"The Phantom of the Open Hearth\", which told of teenage Ralphie's prom experience, not to mention giving us the first screen depiction of the leg lamp story. That was in 1976. Then, in 1978, \"The Great American 4th of July and Other Disasters\", which is a true favorite of mine and stars a young Matt Damon as Ralph, again a teenager in a real Ralphie-style 4th of July must-view celebration. The blind date bit is priceless! Then, in 1983, there was \"The Star-Crossed Romance of Josephine Cosnowski\" (okay, admittedly, not sure if this one came out before or after A Christmas Story). Again, we see Ralph as a teen in this one, when he finds his first love in the Polish girl who moves in next door after the hillbilly Bumpuses move out. Technically, this is Ralphie's Thanksgiving story, and it's very fun and funny . All three of those were television films made for PBS's American Playhouse, as was the next Ralphie film, showing a bit of influence from \"A Christmas Story\" this time, as here Ralph is a little younger. The film is 1988's \"Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss\", and it tells about Ralph's first job, the family's lost dog, and the big, annual, family road trip. Finally, we have the most direct sequel to \"A Christmas Story\", the big screen release from Christmas Story director Bob Clark, \"My Summer Story\", which is set the summer after Ralphie received his Red Ryder blue-steel beauty. This little noticed 1994 film, like all the others, stars a mostly different cast (Charles Grodin is the Old Man here, and Mary Steenburgen is Mom, with Kieran Culkin as Ralph), and tells the tales of Ralph's summer quest for the ultimate fighting top, mom's gravy boat incident, fishing with the Old Man, and a trip to the World's Fair. \"My Summer Story\" is also sometimes called \"It Runs in the Family\", but it's not the only film that has used that title. Bottom line, if you love \"A Christmas Story\" for all of it's great qualities beyond the Christmas stuff, then you will likely enjoy all the other Ralphie films too. All are fine films with great, nostalgic stories and casts, and all are narrated by the late, great Jean Shepherd. I recommend them all! Though, you'll have to be net savvy to get the PBS films. My Summer Story, happily, IS available on DVD, and Ollie Hopnoodle's did get a VHS release. Incidentally, I first saw all these films on the Disney Channel back when that channel was seriously good. Some of you may remember that as well. Happy hunting!Update: You may or may not have heard about the soon to be release \"A Christmas Story 2\", coming direct to DVD. It's toting itself as the \"Official\" sequel to \"A Christmas Story\", as if this one was not. Well, you can watch the trailer online already, and it is really... something. Amazingly, they have done a great job capturing the look of the first (better than My Summer Story did, sadly). Tragically, the acting and lines do not impress (and why does Ralph look like a dummy this time around?). Of course, it looks like they are just trying to do a lot of copying and referencing to the first, too. Okay, sure, this was a bad idea from the start. Shepherd and Clark are deceased (who in the world is narrating this, I wonder?), and the cast is all new, and the writing is clearly contrived, direct to video sequel kinda stuff. Still, when I see the production values and the way they managed to capture the look of \"A Christmas Story\" in the trailer, I do wish they had somehow found a great writer and great actors for it. Oh well. We shall see how it goes. I mean, how can I NOT see it?\n",
      "Just so awesome.  I am not a repeat viewer of many movies but this one definitely qualifies as a must watch again and again...  Happy with the quality and play back and it is available to me season after season,\n",
      "A Christmas Story is a great holiday film. I always love this moive. One of the few movies that i would watch back to back.\n",
      "We've watched Christmas Story for the past 20 years or so and found it to be a great Christmas tradition for the family.  Kids are now gone but visited for New Years eve so we watched it after a hiatus and in HD it was refreshing but probably have seen it enough for a year....  maybe next Christmas?\n",
      "Granted, it is overplayed on TBS, it definitely is a Christmas staple and surely not a movie to miss during the holidays.\n",
      "Buyers BEWARE.....there is misleading information in the reviews below. The Blu-ray version does NOT include all the extras that come with the DVD version. It ONLY includes the Blu-ray movie and the string of leg lights. No cookie cutters, etc. I bought this version.....so I am certain of what's included. Dont be fooled by the misleading info!\n",
      "This movie is filled with nostalgic moments that will remind you of your childhood if you were born in the 50's!\n",
      "Good price and fast delivery.  This has become a Christmas classic righ from the first year it was made.  I don't think that a  Holiday season passes that we don;\\'t watch it at least once.  I thought it was time to get my own copy.\n",
      "Few films can stand to be seen as many times as 'A Christmas Story'. If you grew up in the 50's or 60's this film will really bring back memories of being a kid at Christmas time, but anyone should be able to relate to this film. I avoided this film for a few years because TNT played this film continually for 24 hours every Christmas. I finally was ready for a viewing and what better day to do it?The film is a timeless classic brimming with the excitement of the holiday. The narrative only enhances the dialogue going on in our own minds. This was Christmas in a simpler time, when the emphasis wasn't on over spending, but the thought of family and that one special item for Christmas morning could make all the difference.The two disc set is very nice with full and widescreen versions of the film included, There is also a fair amount of extras including commentary, trivia game, \"making of\" feature-ette with on screen comments by the director, Billingsley and three other child actors from the film. There are spots on Daisy rifles and the famous leg lamp and a few other interesting tidbits to toggle through. While most of the extras are fun, none of them are essential or give any real insight on this excellent low budget film. I would have loved more depth in the making of feature-ette and not just the actors remarking on how much they liked making the film. The DVD transfer looks really good and if you don't have this in your collection, you should.Merry Christmas everyone, from yours truly Dr Shock!\n",
      "What a fun, LOL Christmas movie.  I have never seen this movie until recently, and I wonder why I have never watched it before.  I highly recommend it.  Clean fun; very refreshing.\n",
      "Christmas Story was hilarious back when I saw it in the theatre years ago, and also each of the many Christmas' since.  My father loved it, I love it and my students on high school love it.  Good clean humor that everyone can relate to.\n",
      "I never get tired of this movie! The humor is so insane and yet so funny because it's true.  How many of us can laugh knowingly at Randy not being able to put his arms down? Or at the kids screaming in terror when they're placed on Santa's lap, though they waited ages just to see him? And who hasn't pulled out all the stops in order to get that one amazing Christmas gift?This film combines so many fun little anecdotes with a heaping splash of nostalgia.  Who isn't warmed every time they see it?I bought this DVD and I watch it even in the summer! It's a great little investment.\n",
      "Christmas isn't \"right\" until I have seen the leg-lamp and heard \"You'll put your eye out!\" GREAT movie !!! Love it!\n",
      "This movie is guaranteed to put you in the Christmas spirit, even if you do shoot your eye out with that brand-new Red Ryder bb gun with a compass in the stock and this thingy that tells time (if you haven't seen the movie, that made little sense to you).  The story and filmography will make you think that this was a classic you grew up with as a kid.  However, unless you were a kid in 1990 - you're wrong.  It was released in 1983.As far as the DVD is concerned - there is nothing to get excited about.  Aside from the theatrical trailer, there are no special features on this disk.  In fact, it's only available full-screen format and the audio isn't even stereo.If you're looking for a high-quality holiday movie that the entire family can enjoy - you just found it.\n",
      "When the film was released in 1983 it did not do well at the box office.  I remember thatIt is a good film, funny.  Stands the test of time thirty years after it's releaseGrown into a big deal at Christmas time to watch it.  How the status of the film has grownGood to have the film wide screen hereMy complaint is the extras are old.  Thirty year anniversary as I input this and it featured an extra from the twenty  year edition of the filmI see no difference from the DVD versions & this blu rayIf you are a fan of the film get this just remember if you have previous editions of the film on DVD you already have the extras\n",
      "For 14 years my husband and I have watched this movie with our family every Christmas morning. It's a tradition we are passing down to our grandchildren.Makes wonderful memories :)\n",
      "The absolute best of any of the Christmas movies.  A heartwarming story of a family in the midwest several decades ago, covering much material that is not Christmas material.  Terrific script and acting and camera work.  A real delight that deserves to overtake \"It's a Wonderful Life\".\n",
      "One of the best Holiday movie and it's fun to watch and I double dog dare ya to watch this movie.. lol\n",
      "Great movie!  One of the best Christmas movies ever made.  We visited the real house where this was filmed in Cleveland and it was neat.\n",
      "\"A Christmas Story\" is my all-time favorite movie so there is absolutely nothing bad I can say about it!Set in the 1940's, the story revolves around Ralphie, a nine-year-old growing up in the midwest, who only wants one thing for Christmas: a bb gun. The movie follows Ralphie, his friends, and family through hilarious adventures, most of them revolving around the bb gun.Laughs abound in this movie and you can't help but cheer for Ralphie when he finally receives his coveted Christmas gift.Every Christmas I watch this movie and still cannot get enough of it. Although I own it both on VHS and DVD, I can't help but watch the 24-hour marathon on TNT on Christmas Eve.This is one movie that is a classic and will be loved for many generations to come! I STRONGLY recommend watching this movie! I know there will not be one thing you dislike about it!\n",
      "Entertaining and fun to watch.  Easy to purchase on Amazon.  I like that you can watch it on-line after purchasing.\n",
      "can't say nothing bad about this movie, wife loves it so that is all I have to say about that.\n",
      "This movie is my favorite christmas movie...cause it has everything...comedy, wit, tears and a lot of holiday magic...\n",
      "Such a classic, funny movie!  We watch it every Christmas and laugh every time.  A great family tradition for sure!\n",
      "I first watched this movie on television in the early 80's. At the time I was wondering how there could have been a Christmas film that I had never seen before, not realising that it had been out for a short while at that time.I laughed throughout the movie as nostalgia shook my memory. I remember being told that if I had a bb gun I would shoot my eye out. I remember my mother washing my mouth out with soap, and when Ralphie's mother asked where he had heard \"that\" word his answer is Schwartz but he knew that it was his dad which has actually taught him the word. It reminded me of my youth as these things actually happened to me and others that I knew so to me the movie portrays a normal family for that generation. Oh to be able to go back to that time for just a few minutes.If you're looking to buy A Christmas Story then by all means go ahead. It's a timeless classic that will be entertaining both young and old a like for years to come.\n",
      "I love this!  I don't know what I like best; everything in the tin is wonderful.  I'm so glad that I bought it.\n",
      "I have seen A Christmas Story once before and I enjoyed it so much I decided to buy it so I can watch it anytime I want.  It's a wonderful Christmas story that makes me feel warm and toasty about Christmas.\n",
      "This movie captures the entire Christmas spirit in a comedic slice-of-life, almost Seinfeld-esque fashion.  The dynamics of Ralph's family are universally understood, and the genuine nature of the story shone through the Christmas themes.  The performances were dead-on perfect, including Darrin McGavin as the cantankerous Old Man and Peter Billingsley as the fearless hero Ralphie.  The misadventures of this clan (changing the flat tire, the Bumpus hounds, the parental struggle over the lamp, the \"summit\" with Santa, Christmas dinner) are a scream.  And best of all, it captures the highs and lows of the best holiday around.  This is one of the best comedies ever and a holiday staple.  Add this to your collection.\n",
      "This is my family's favorite Christmas movie every year. We start watching it early and often! Love, love, love it!!!!!\n",
      "I gave this to my son as a gift.  He loved it and watched it on Christmas Day with our family.\n",
      "I first saw this movie in 1988 and have watched it every Christmas since then. I love it.Having it on DVD instead of VHS makes it so much easier to watch, (and it takes up much less room as I put all my discs in albums).\n",
      "I had never seen the movie before. My grandsons and enjoyed watching it.We'll watch it each year at Christmas time.\n",
      "A Christmas Story is one of the funniest if not the funniest stories I've ever heard. I first discovered it many years ago when Jean Shepherd was doing a weekly hour on the radio. He is my all-time favorite comedian and I have missed ever since he no longer has the radio show (or at least if he's not doing a radio show, he's not on the air anywhere I've been in the past 30 or so years.  I am SO happy to oqn rhia two-disc Special Addition of A Christmas Story.\n",
      "Of course, I'm of a certain age when this brings back childhood memories...How many of us tried to lick a frozen pole as a child???  The movie captured perfectly all of the nuances of a midwestern, middle class childhood!\n",
      "Best Christmas movie ever, bar none!  You must see this incredibly funny movie of the American Christmas tradition!  See it now!\n",
      "As my daughter became old enough to start to take in some of the \"classic\" Christmas movies mixed for children and adults, I wondered, \"would A Christmas Story\" hold up to a modern child?  Yes, of course.  I remember seeing this when I was a child, and although the world is a different place now, it is still quite easy to relate to the base themes.  It was brilliant to set this movie in a time other than 1983--the result is it \"feels\" fresher and without fad, just good old Christmas traditions intermixed with childhood angst, wonder, and surprise.  Still highly recommended!\n",
      "My family makes sure to watch this movie every year at Christmas time. It makes us laugh and never gets old.\n",
      "A truly hilarious and heart-warming movie.  I had never seen it the whole way through, and thought no better way to experience it than on the big hidef screen.  Very good remastering, nice and clean; makes it look better than some re-released (ie: upscaled, not remastered) movies I've purchased recently.Mind you, these were ones filmed in 2002-2005, they just didn't bother to clean them up and just upscaled them, meaning they look all blocky and didn't take advantage of the full resolution of BluRayI give it 5 stars for content, and remastering to BluRay.\n",
      "Our DVD player finally gave up the ghost, so it was great to find we could stream this. It's not quite Christmas without a visit from Ralphie and company.(My favorite Christmas movie is Die Hard...probably always will be....)\n",
      "Interesting movie.  I saw this on TV when I was younger.  I saw things in this movie I had not noticed when I was younger.  When I saw one of the boys stick his tongue onto a pole during winter I had to laugh (I also wondered how they achieved that stunt for the movie); however, it is a good family movie to watch during the holidays.\n",
      "Classic movie now on bluray.  Can't get any better, put the leg-lamp in the window and break out the bb gun!\n",
      "i was very pleased with this purchase. this is our all time favorite classic christmas movie. also to get the apron and cookie cutters in the collectors tin was great as well. we collect christmas story items and this was a wonderful addition.\n",
      "This movie is hysterical and really caputures tue Holiday season and makes you think that your family might not be as crazy as you think they are!  Definately a classic Christmas movie.\n",
      "This is the most favorite Christmas movie of all times because you usually end up watching it over and over and over! Great movie!\n",
      "A classic for boomers that lusted after BB guns when they were youngsters.  The acting was superb and story line works for any era.\n",
      "This movie was made a year after I was born and I dont remember a year when I didn't watch it! I am in love with this movie and am so excited about this collectors edition! I have the book that is advertised it is awesome! A true must for A christmas story fans! Merry Christmas!\n",
      "Love the movie. One of the Best Christmas Movie ever. I watch it every year. I'd watch it all year round, not just at Christmas time.\n",
      "This is a great Christmas movie.  It has become a tradition in our house to watch this film every Christmas Eve and Christmas day.\n",
      "I LIKE HOW THE MOVIE CAME EXACTLY IN A WEEK AND CAME JUST THE WAY HE SAID THE MOVIE WAS GOING TO BE NEW (:\n",
      "I had never seen this movie, despite the yearly TV showings, but had heard that it was a classic so it was worth spending a few dollars to watch it at Christmastime. Quite enjoyable, and surprisingly funny.\n",
      "A Christmas Story is a little off beat, but....It good clean humor, which maybe a bad thing to say today, but it is strange enough for an older crowd to enjoy just how off beat it is.\n",
      "We watch this movie on TV every Christmas so decided to get our own copy this year. However, after I had ordered this one, our daughter brought one home from the store, so I returned this one without opening it. The service was good and it came quickly -- just waiting for my refund.\n",
      "Our family saw this \"at the movies\" when it came out. We loved it then, and we love it now !We purchased it and watch it every year with our grandson's and tell them their father was only 10 years old when it first came out. They think their father is ancient.It is one of our Christmas traditions. It is fun movie.\n",
      "Good ole Christmas classic. Not full of political correct garbage or filthy. Just a good old Christmas comedy! You'll shoot your eye out!\n",
      "Good movie. Fun. A classic. Love the time period. Not as good as a Christmas Carol or Its a wonderful life.\n",
      "We love this movie!!! It's been a tradition for nearly 20 years. First on VHS, then DVD, and now we had to get it on Blu-ray. So many good quotes. A super cult classic!\n",
      "What can you say.  It is a clean movie that you don't have to worry about with the children watching with you.\n",
      "this is a classic, and one of the best, christmas classics.  It is about a happy childhood, not a perfect family, so it is true to life;)  thanks for allowing me to see it at such a low price, for soooooooo much enjoyment for the season:) denise evans\n",
      "Watching this movie is like curly up in a pile of wrapping paper, surrounded by new gifts, with the xmas tree lights blinking and snow falling outside.  Warm, fuzzy, fun.  Hard not to love this movie no matter the age.\n",
      "Once we switched from cable to just Apple TV this was one of the first dvd's I bought. There was no way I was going without my 24 hours of a Christmas Story this year :)\n",
      "This is the funniest movie ever made period. I dont see how anyone could not laugh at the hilarious exploits of nine-year-old Ralphie and his quest for a BB Gun. While his old man shouts gibberish at the furnace and his old lady tries to get his kid brother to eat, Ralphie comes up with plan after plan, every one failing spectacularly. If you wanna see the funniest movie ever made, you gotta get this one, because you will truly laugh your pants off.\n",
      "I'll never forget the first time I saw A Christmas Story.  It was in Columbus, Ohio, see?  I'm out there with my buddy to celebrate Thanksgiving with his mother.  This had become something of an annual tradition over the  preceeding years, and consisted of he and I chowing down on her wonderful cooking ( done in the biggest microwave cooker I've ever seen) and then taking her to see the movie of her choice.As might be imagined neither of us were too thrilled at the prospect of watching a cute bright eyed kid in a Christmas adventure, but, well, It was Momma's choice so we had to go without complaint, and, anyway, Darren McGavin was in it, so it couldn't be ALL bad.The opening credits rolled and the action started.  We heard the narrator describe the bacchanilia of greed, a voice that had come to us from over the airwaves of Fun City to the wilderness of northwestern New Jersey.  A voice that had spoken to us of Concrete Mexicans and other glories of slob culture.  It was SHEPHERD!  I had read the book!  Seldom have I enjoyed a movie so much.\n",
      "This is a great dvd. Glad I got it. Now I can watch this movie anytime I want. thank you\n",
      "So many aspects of this movie remind me of what Christmas dreams were like for a child.  A warm and funny family classic that is sure to get you into the holiday mood!\n",
      "Ralphie..... \"ohhh fuuuddgggeee!\"Who can forget the GREAT lines in this movie! I look forward to seeing this movie every Christmas. The \"collection\" with the stringing christmas lights are cute as well. They're of the leg lamp shade.PROS: Price, great blu-ray CD, cute christmas lightsCONS: none noted\n",
      "I absolutely Love this movie, esp during Holiday Seasons!! To me it's the Ultimate family Christmas movie.  And even though it takes place in the 30's or 40's, it sure brings back wonderful memories of my own childhood Christmases!!\n",
      "Probably as timeless of an American Christmas story for little boys as there could ever be. It may be set in a different time from today, but you can bet that there are little boys who dream about a particular Christmas gift in just the same way as this boy does.Excellent.\n",
      "I considered this movie a must see modern Christmas season tradition since early and frequent childhood exposure. This past season it was revealed to me that my wife had never seen it and I was incredulous. I instantly opened Amazon Instant Video on my PlayStation 3. Given the option to rent or buy this classic, I didn't hesitate to purchase the rights to view this video from then on for years to come. It turns out that it might be more of a man's idea of traditional Christmas fare, as my wife was less than enthusiastic after experiencing the narrators recalling of a crude and boyish Christmas. My kids loved it and my wife offers no objections to bar A Christmas Story from becoming a family tradition.\n",
      "What a classic. How can you not like this movie. Takes you back to that time. I watch it every year.\n",
      "This is a holiday must have.  Who doesn't love A Christmas Story?  It is always a favorite in our house!\n",
      "I absolutely love this movie and they only play it on Christmas eve. Now I can watch it in July!\n",
      "This was a replacement for a lost DVD and the blu ray version met all our expectations. Husband's favorite Christmas movie!\n",
      "Don't need to say too much about this movie almost sure everyone has seen it at one time or another.  An it does bring back memories for me.  Hope it does the same for you\n",
      "Christmas just wouldn't be the same without a marathon of A Christmas Story. I love this movie and I'm glad to have it in my 'library'.\n",
      "I absolutely loved this movie when it first came out and I still do! I was born in the early sixties but it still manages to bring back memories of my own holidays as a child and it is one of the best Christmas movies to watch ,especially if you need to laugh! I don't have a(gasp!) wide screen TV or (heaven forbid!) a Blu-ray so this full screen DVD is perfect for me! Thanks Ralphie,you always come through!\n",
      "This movie is a classic so I decided to buy it.  We used it in our Christmas gift exchange and everyone loved it.  No problems at all.\n",
      "Don't get me wrong, I did but I'm realizing I'm turning into my father because I mostly walked around the apartment doing other things and knowing exactly when to laugh and at what.\n",
      "Loved it when i was a kid and my kids are now watching it.A modern American Classic, must see around the holidays.\n",
      "One of our all-time favorite Christmas movies. It has some some really fun parts. It will make you laugh at the way things were then. For those of us old enough; we 've heard these phrases from our parents.\n",
      "It wouldn't be Christmas without watching this movie at our house.  An old time favorite that our grandchildren are now enjoying too.\n",
      "No matter how many time I've seen this movie it still makes me laugh.  It's a classic>\n",
      "This was bought as a gift for my son.  One of his all time favorite Christmas movies!  It has become a tradition that after our Christmas dinner we watch this movie as a family.  I don't know how it will look as a bluray movie but I hope that it will be a much better picture and sound.  I know that he will be thrilled to get this as one of his gifts.\n",
      "This movie is a modern classic - Our kids told us about it and we haveenjoyed it every Christmas since - We were the same age as Ralphieat the time this movie is set in - the time is captured perfectly.  The characters arewell written and the everyone in the movie does a great job! Fun\n",
      "had to show the kids a great movie for the holidays and this is one of the best!!! will watch it again!!\n",
      "I love love love this movie. My whole family watches this on a consistent basis. I am shocked when people tell me they have never seen it. This movie takes you back to a time when the holiday season was about family, faith and presents not like today where you don't want to offend anyone by saying Merry Christmas. This movie is a classic of all time! I love Ralphie!! I don't know how some of the actors got through some of the scenes without laughing. The father is hilarious and I love the mother who hasn't had a hot meal in years. I totally understand as a mom myself.\n",
      "Movie was very good.  Really enjoyed watching it anytime I wish, not just when it is Christmas time.Good remake of the movie\n",
      "You'll shoot your eye out... but it's safe to buy this film... digitally mine forever.  What's to say - perfect in every way.\n",
      "Hard to believe that this year marks 25 years we were introduced to young Ralphie and the quest for his air power rifle. It is still a fun filled movie for the entire family. Of course we don't recommned that you stick your tongue on a frozen pole and savoring the taste of a bar of soap (you could if you want to!). A Christmas Story is delightful all the way. Fast forward 25 years later to 2008, Peter Billingsley is the man behind another successful Christmas movie...Four Christmases. We will never get enough of this movie for many years to come. I liked this one...enjoy!!!\n",
      "I watch this every christmas. It is hilarious. More of an adult christmas movie, kids will not get some of the humor. Especially between the parents.\n",
      "This movie is awesome!  It's a rare instance where the movie is better than the book.  I've read In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash, which the movie is taken from, and it was good, but the movie is one you'll watch every year.\n",
      "This is a classic.  It is hilarious with a few heart-warming moments.  A lot of nostalgia too.  Each time I watch it it just seems to get funnier and I pick up on things that I may have missed before.  Two thumbs way way up!\n",
      "I don't have the HD version yet, but I will be owning it day 1 it comes out! This was the all time BEST Xmas movie ever. I don't care what anyone says! On Xmas eve, through Xmas night. the Tv stays on 24/7 on TBS I think it is or TNT, to watch 24 hours of A Christmas story! This movie is a True classic and a timeless piece of absolute perfection that EVERYONE should own. If you have not seen this movie, Shame on you!Paul\n",
      "I've loved watching this movie around Christmas since I was a kid.  We have made it a renewed tradition with our kids, and they love it too!\n",
      "A classic, feel-good movie. Brings back fond memories including the classic Red Ryder B-B gun. Cities and towns no longer decorate like in the movie. Too many families no longer cherish Christmas morning  together. The getting has gotten more important than the giving.\n",
      "This is my favorite movie of all time!  It has become an annual tradition, in my family,  to watch this movie at Christmas.  In fact, one TV network runs it, nonstop, for 24 hours, on Christmas.  That's how good it is!  My older brother, who is 79, even sets up a \"Christmas Story\" display of the movie set with houses and everything during the holiday season.  I particularly like it because It let's everyone my age  remember a \"simpler time\" before all of these electronic toys when kids went to Higbee's (or, in my case John Wanamakers, in Philly) to tell Santa what you wanted for Christmas.  Incidently, I own the 25th anniversary addition of the movie already, but I just had to get it on Bluray!  It is as much a part of the holidays as A Christmas Carol by Dickens...in my opinion!\n",
      "I was disappointed that our local station didn't play the usual 24-hour \"Christmas Story\" marathon, so I rented it. Next year I'll be buying it so I'll always have it. It is, however, one of those \"you either love it or hate it\" movies. Myself and my daughters love it, while my wife hates it. Oh well... she's missing out.\n",
      "This movies is the best!  I watch it over and over!  I really don't think you can ever get tired of watching it!\n",
      "It doesn't have to be Christmas to watch Ralphie & the gang. If it is Christmas, this movie makes it all the better. It is a family classic & will forever be in your heart when you watch it for the first time or the hundredth time!\n",
      "got this for grandchildren and sat and watched it with them it brought back so many memories of my youth.  Should be a required view for children\n",
      "One of the few holiday classics that just seems to get better every time I watch it.  Look forward to it every year.\n",
      "A true Christmas classic, offbeat as it is, gets better with every viewing.  A definite must for your holiday viewing library.\n",
      "my son and his 3 kids love driving mom nuts watching this movie over and over again...  they just love it!!!\n",
      "The all time most favorite movie ever! It's iconic in the Christmas season and the catch phrase \"you'll shoot your eye out\" is one of the best known phrases ever! i love this movie and watch it as often as I can!\n",
      "its the annual tradition. to bring in the holiday season with this movie. always was 5 stars, always will be. never get tired of it.\n",
      "This is great family entertainment.  Kids and grown-ups alike will want to make this movie a Christmas tradition.  It's a gem!!\n",
      "This is the absolute best Xmas movie, especially if you can watch it uncut with no commercial breaks. For me, it just wouldn't be the holidays without watching this classic at least once. If you've never seen this (hard to believe) do yourself a favor and watch it this year and it'll become an annual tradition.\n",
      "In the nostalgic days of yesteryear, there existed a child named Ralphie in all of us. Narrated brilliantly by Jean Shepherd and based on his childhood memoirs, In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash, A Christmas Story (1983) has truly become a splendid holiday favorite classic rivaling in its popularity Frank Capra's masterwork \"It's a Wonderful Life\".Set in the 1940's, director Bob Clark managed to capture the essence of childhood Christmas through the eyes of Ralphie, an unwittingly comical child whose imaginative character is both endearing and enduring. The plot revolves around Ralphie's aching desire for a Daisy Brand Red-Ryder BB rifle for Christmas, and his mom's opposition to it because she's afraid he'll shoot his eye out. We're amused by dad's on-going fight with the basement's smoke-belching furnace, and the old man's almost incessant child-like awe and obsession of a tacky woman's leg lamp he had won in a contest. Amid all of this, we meet Ralphie's whiny little brother, Randy, his silly school friends, the street bullies, and the surreal department store Santa.Aside from \"you'll shoot your eye out\", the film is filled with memorable lines including Ralphie's major swear words \"Oh, fudge - only I didn't say fudge\", and \"Ovaltine? A crummy commercial? Son of a b...\" and his disappointment when he got his school paper back after he was expecting an A+, \"a C+? Oh no, it can't be!\"The film appeals to all ages, but adults may find it especially amusing since it lets us look back and laugh at our own childhood.\n",
      "This movie is a Christmas tradition for my family, we watch every year! Appropriate for kids and has humor for all ages.\n",
      "This movie story by Jean Shepherd is a must-see for anyone over the age of 40.  He speaks of life as it was in the 1940's and 50's.  A much simpler time for most, but not for a young boy of 10.  I recommend \"A Christmas Story\" as the one to see every Christmastime.\n",
      "Darren McGavin is just like everyone's \"Old Man\"....\"The most feared furnace fighter in northern Indiana...\"I love the house also...\n",
      "Growing up I used to love this movie so much, they used to put it on a 24 hour marathon on the TNT Channel, and I'd keep it going all day. It really is one of the best holiday films ever, if you have yet to see it I'd definitely give it a go.\n",
      "It's become a tradition in my home that I watch this movie every Christmas Season. And with good reason. A Christmas Story is one of the greatest 'seasonal' movies ever made. A belief proven by cable channels such as TNT showcasing the movie non-stop over 24 hour periods. In the movie Ralphy, a mid-western kid with cowboy dreams and real life ho-hums, dreams of having a BB Gun of his very own. Much to the shagrin of the adults around him who constantly remind him he'll \"shoot his eye out\". Peter Billingsley performs his heart out as we see him lay the child-like ground work to get his dream gun while having to put up with school yard bullies, a crotchity old father and the shame of all shames: having to wear a pink bunny suit on Christmas! More than just children will love this movie as I myself 'feel like a kid again' every year watching this great classic.\n",
      "I'm so glad this movie was available in Blu-Ray! Our family watched this movie on tv every Christmas. The best part about this movie is no commercials!\n",
      "This is a great movie! Classic and timeless. Funny, witty, coming of age and just pure fun to watch and laugh.\n",
      "This movie will take you back to those happy Christmas memories of your childhood.  If you have never seen this movie you need to watch it.  If you purchase this movie you won't be sorry.  We watch this movie every year at Christmas and it puts us in the Christmas spirit.\n",
      "we can all relate to someone in this witty flick, and the \"kid\" with an inner voice sharing his every thought\n",
      "Defintely five star..Author Jean Sheperd was a genesis.I knew jean he was a ham radio operator an i talked to him offten,he will be missed....Tnx fer bringing back good memories....A very satisfied customer...\n",
      "great family fun. you'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll hug those around you as you watch the crazy christmas comedy.\n",

      "For our family this movie has become a tradition to watch during the holidays.  There are so many great and funny scenes in it that we love to see over and over.\n",
      "This movie is a classic.  I have wanted to buy it for years and finally got around to doing it.\n",
      "I have read one review that was rather scathing of some of the actors.... I don't give a darn about what some of them have done in the past... Here is my review of this Christmas Classic...Little Ralphie Parker wants a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas and his Mother to the Teacher tell him that he would shoot his eye out... It was funny to hear the kid talk about Grizzley bears and shooting the bad guys in his daydreams...I thought that it was good to see Peter Billingsly as he is now... Even his fellow actor that dared Flick to stick his tongue to the pole still looked the same too... The one who played Farkus was just having a ball in the interview! I could see that he and his fellow co stars had a great time doing the film...I even thought that it was great to see how that outrageous \"leg lamp was made... and even watching the film about how the BB gun was made.... As to the others that were not there, maybe \"Randy\" wasn't interested and The old man and the mom could not be added to the DVD to to space... DVDs are always improving... There is always a next time...I thought that the film looked sharp and crisp.. The commentary was really cool, and I thought that the 20th Anniversery release of this film was better then expected... I hope that some of you will give this new release a chance and Just injoy it... I know I will...\"You'll Shoot your Eye out Kid!\"\n",
      "I love this movie and bought the CD so I could watch it on my schedule. The CD is well done, no problems\n",
      "When Peter Billingsley turned sarcastic Jean Shepherd's story into a movie, the results were bound to be funny.  A Christmas Story is more than funny, however, it is also touching, a true slice of post-WWII America, and a touchstone for the season.Ralphie, a lad in late 40's Cleveland, goes through all the kid rituals of the season, fantasizing about getting a Red Ryder BB gun.  His mom (Melinda Dillon) and dad (brilliantly played by Darren McGavin) may have other ideas.  Can Santa or his grade school teacher intervene?  Will the local bully meddle?  Will he die of Lifeboy poisoning before the holiday?The film has great timing more than anything else, and the fade-outs to kid fantasies are hysterical.If you haven't seen Story yet, order and watch- it will be a seasonal regular.  If you know the film, it is time to upgrade to DVD and get a copy in your library.\n",
      "This holiday flick definitely ranks in the Top Ten Christmas films of all time, but it caters to a unique audience.  The sense of humor is succinct (not subtle) and the acting definitely outlines the minds and thoughts of many during the Christmas season.  Any film that portrays the thoughts of youngsters when Santa Claus was real...when white Christmas's meant s-o-o-o much...and the excitement of opening presents early on Christmas morn, will love this film.  I believe the best acting performance is turned in by Melinda Dillion (Mom).  She is the most believable.  Child star Peter Billingsley is cute as a blonde, blue-eyed youngster, but he has very few lines and has ample cameo shots (without dialogue).  Veteran actor Darren McGavin is silly and boisterous...but Melinda wins the show.  A must during the Christmas season, this film is funny and will warm your heart.  I'm surprised I waited so long to watch this gem. However, I wouldn't show this film to children.  The angry father (profanity) and the bullish thugs at school may frighten the very young.  All 5 stars!\n",
      "The most perfect imperfect Christmas movie.  We watch it every year.  This year, we introduced a new generation to it.  So glad we got a DVD copy instead of watching on TV with commercials.\n",
      "A Christmas tradition at our house! My daughter discovered this movie this year and wants to watch it and talk about it over and over. What a fun family film.\n",
      "I love this movie, especia;;y whe I recognized downtown Cleveland. The whole winter wonderland makes me long for my home in Conneaut, Ohio. Thanks for making this video available.\n",
      "I was worried about the blue ray quality but it turns out excellent. The movie does not need any review from me. It is a classic and I love it.\n",
      "For me, this is a childhood favorite! We watch it every Christmas, and when they show it on tv for 24 hours. I love how it has the classic look of the 40's! I have a lot of favorite parts that there are too many to list. In case you are new, I'll give you a brief synopsis; Ralphie Parker wants an official Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot range model air rifle (BB Gun) for Christmas, but his mother, teacher, and Santa Claus keep telling him \"You'll shoot your eye out\" Will Ralphie get his BB gun? If you love Christmas, comedies, and classics, you'll love A CHRISTMAS STORY!!!\n",
      "This was a good movie. It bought out that young boy just whanted on thing more then anything in the world. He did not give up on it.\n",
      "This is a great movie and it was delivered really fast.  I definitely would recommend it to anyone and all.\n",
      "This movie was well worth the purchase price. It is now a family tradition to watch A Christmas Story every year.\n",
      "A timeless classic that I had to have.  Hilarious every year since I first saw it almost 30 years ago.\n",
      "Best Christmas story on film, well written, well acted. Makes you feel good. And it is very realistic - for me, anyway\n",
      "great movie to watch year round! good for standard dvd players! kids will love it and watch it all day!\n",
      "its a christmas classicnothingeverybody should watch a christmas story and yes i did tell people about how great this movie is\n",
      "This is a movie must see for our family each Christmas season, a cute movie about a kid and his family in the 50's and how they spend their Christmas.\n",
      "It's only natural for young people to let fly anything out of their mouths. And although these kids don't actually use the foul language that is so usual from Hollywood these days, the language is still not suitable for playback at the church daycare center.Nevertheless, it is a charming story about average people, having average exeriences, in an often hilarious way. There are even several good life-lessons to learn from it.Watch it with your kids, and make sure your moral teaching isn't undermined. It will be much more enjoyable together, anyway.\n",
      "This was a gift to myself. I have loved this movie for years. It is for all ages. The cookbook inside is wonderful. Is has great pictures and also sayings from the movie and great pictures. The extra DVD has interviews with the stars. I love the apron that came with the set also. The price was even cheaper than any of the stores I shopped in.\n",
      "My whole family loves this movie - it has become for us a classic right up with A Wonderful Life, and one we enjoy watching together every year at Christmas time.\n",
      "What's not to love.  This is movie that can be watched and enjoyed for years.  Nice remaster, and we enjoy watching it every year.\n",
      "This is a lovely entertaining movie that happened during the years of my parent's childhood. Ralphie's dad is definitely my father and I believe that is why I love this movie. I have worn out three VHS tapes, so I have now become a DVD owner. This movie is seen by me every Thanksgiving night to begin my happy Christmas season every year.\n",
      "This one is a Christmas favorite at our house.  Now we won't have to wait for it to come on the TV channels, we can watch it all through the Christmas season!\n",
      "My all time favorite movie, had on DVD wanted on Blu ray but it was $29 in retail stores so when I saw it for a great price, I got it right away love it!\n",
      "A family classic full of humor and fun about the realities of Christmas.  Still true today and never outdates itself.\n",
      "Very funny movie. Great movie for kids. Takes me back to when I was young.  Would recommend to everyone !\n",
      "I have seen this movie so many times and I still laugh at certain parts every single time I see it. I just love that it's now one of my kids favorites, too!!\n",
      "Bought it for a Christmas present...along with an electric throw for the couch..decorator pillows to match the throw. Great way to snuggle up and watch this Christmas classic! The whole ensemble was a big hit !!\n",
      "There's nothing I can say about this movie that you don't probably already know. I'm 56 and had never seen it until about 10 yrs ago when a co-worker couldn't believe that I'd never seen it & badgered me to watch it. Glad she did because now it's one of my favorite Xmas movies.\n",
      "A fun movie about about Christmas and life before battery powered toys and mass merchandising.  The story is based on a very memorable family.  If you ever wondered where  the idea for the \"leg lamps\" for sale at Christmas time came from, this movie will give you the answer.\n",
      "One memorable Christmas in the life of a nine-year-old in 1940's Indiana makes for a memorable movie and reflections on the innocence of youth in \"A Christmas Story,\" directed by Bob Clark and starring young Peter Billingsley, Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon.  What is happiness?  To young Ralphie Parker (Billingsley), it's simple; it's getting the best Christmas present a boy could ask for, namely a genuine Red Ryder 200-shot carbine action air rifle BB gun.  But it's getting close to the big day, and his hopes are fading fast; there's an obstacle between him and the coveted weaponry:  Mom (Dillon).  And the answer is \"No.\"  But why!?  \"You'll shoot your eye out.\"  Reasoning and wisdom to which there is simply no argument.  But, as Yogi once said, \"It ain't over till it's over,\" and a determined Ralphie refuses to give in or give up on his quest for the ultimate gift.  And as the story unfolds we get a glimpse, through Ralphie's eyes, of the way life was in another time and another place; an era long since gone, but never forgotten.  Based on a portion of the Novel \"In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash,\" by Jean Shepherd, with a screenplay by Shepherd, Leigh Brown and Bob Clark, Shepherd narrates (as the adult Ralphie), with reminiscences that are poignant and delightful; about Dad (McGavin), an Oldsmobile man, turkey lover and fabled \"furnace fighter,\" who in the heat of battle could weave a tapestry of profanity that as far as anyone knows is still hanging in the air somewhere over Lake Michigan; Mom, a woman who hadn't had a hot meal in years, thanks to tending to the needs of her family first; younger brother Randy (Ian Petrella); friends Flick (Scott Schwartz) and Schwartz (R.D. Robb) who share Ralphie's myriad adventures and set the protocol of the \"dare,\" from the singular all the way up to the coup de grace, the \"triple dog dare,\" employed during a contest to determine, once and for all, if one's tongue will in fact stick to a frozen metal flag pole; the endearing Miss Shields (Tedde Moore), the teacher who makes them write a THEME; and last, but not least, the yellow-eyed neighborhood bully, Scott Farcus (Zack Ward) and his toadie, Grover Dill (Yano Anaya), who give new meaning to the phrase, \"Say Uncle!\"  There are humorous anecdotes about flights of fancy and lessons in life, like how to change a tire in record time and how to barter for the right Christmas tree (from Dad), and tricks used to get your younger brother to eat his food instead of just playing with it, as well as alternative uses for soap (from Mom).  We also discover how Ralphie learned a valuable lesson about how the journey is often the best part of the goal finally realized (courtesy of a \"Little Orphan Annie\" secret decoder ring), and the real meaning of a \"Major Award.\"  McGavin is perfectly cast as Ralphie's dad, \"The Old Man,\" as he is referred to affectionately, and he gives just the right touch to all of the small ironies of life that seem to surround him, while Dillon gives a winning performance as his mom, whose TLC nurtured the warm memories from which this story was born.  But the most exemplary performance given here is by Peter Billingsley, who forever after will remain Ralphie Parker in the memories of anyone who sees this film.  There is an engaging naturalness about him that makes an instant connection with the audience, for he personifies the child in all of us, and it's a character you'll remember for as long as you retain any memories of your own childhood.  And therein lies the real charm of this movie; because everyone was once a child, and for better or worse, will carry memories akin to Ralphie Parker's (or Jean Shepherd's) forever.  A heartwarming, funny film, \"A Christmas Story\" is a true classic that can be enjoyed again and again and will most likely become an annual event once you've experienced it.  In the tradition of \"It's A Wonderful Life,\" and \"A Christmas Carol,\" this is a movie that can add so much to the festivities, no matter how you celebrate your holidays.\n",
      "I couldn't even count how many times I have seen this picture.  I am glad it finally got the special edition treatment.  This is an American film classic.  It certainly is not a perfect film, but it is endearing.  The settings are great, and it truly feels like you are transported back in time.  The acting is first rate all the way around.  The whole story revolves around little Ralphie's quest for a Red Rider BB Gun on Christmas.  Along the way we experience the Bully, the Leg, the tongue frozen to the poll, a scary Santa, the furnace, and the ultimate bad word among many warm humorous moments.  You can go wrong with this one.\n",
      "This is a \"new\" classic. Not many movies in the past 30 years can compete with this wonderful Christmas movie. If you were born before 1965 you will probably be able to relate. Very funny and well done.\n",
      "We needed to get our 'A Christmas Story' fix for the Christmas season and getting this DVD was the best solution (the show does not come up much on cable and is not available through NetFlix).  The technical quality of the DVD is good and the story is just as much fun as we remembered it.The first DVD we got had been physically damaged but Amazon quickly arranged for a replacement.  Two thumbs up!\n",
      "No, this is not an AWARD winning movie, but it is definitely a tradition in my family.  We cannot go a Christmas without watching A Christmas Story.\n",
      "So many funny scenes to be watched year after year. It is truly a movie that males and females of every age can enjoy. Especially those of us who are 40+.\n",
      "This is a yearly must watch.  Having 48 hours in which to view the movie is also a great feature.\n",
      "This is a classic Christmas story, and because it is told from a young boys point of view it will always be one.\n",
      "This is a classic must have Christmas movie in your Christmas collection.  This movie is filled with laughs.  Get the popcorn ready and turn down the lights.  I just know that you too will love this movie.\n",
      "This is a classic and we watch it every year. We don't have cable anymore so we bought it on instant watch. It's great. Would recommend this for every family.\n",
      "As I've grown in maturity, my tastes have changed in many respects.  For most of my adult life my favorite Christmas story has been Charles Dickens classic scenario \"A Christmas Carol\" written in 1843 and which still remains as one of my favorite Christmas classics.  In fact the movie rendition by Alastair Sim is indeed a Christmas ritual to be seen by all.  With the last 20 years I've changed my mind as to the ultimate \"Christmas Story\".Up front, I must confess that this classic movie was indeed shot and is deeply ensconced into the very fabric of Cleveland culture.  The very house in the movie scenes is now a museum on the near west side of Cleveland.  The very mention of \"The Higbee Company\" issues the very essence of \"A Christmas Story\".  When these scenes were shot in January of 1983, I remember the cold sweeping winds coming off Lake Erie putting Northeast Ohio in a deep freeze.The story itself remains a classic in American culture.  Set in the fictional city of Hohman, Indiana all the dreams and culture of pre-World War II America presents itself.  In fact from a historical point of view the Depression was in fact over and America, not at war, was in the beginnings of unprecedented prosperity.  The actual beginning of life in America as it should be.  In fact Ralphie experienced life on the upswing.The fact of this pre-adolescent receiving a treasured Christmas present shows the rise of the middle class which has gone unabated since.  The Christmas morning scene in which the \"Old Man\" stated that he got a BB gun at Ralphie's age shows the end of the depression and the start of the \"good times\".  However as we watch this movie we can see that discipline 7 decades ago was very real.  Life was indeed more structured and disciplined.  The family not only ate their evening meals together, they also ate their breakfasts as a family unit.  Expectations were tempered and hoped for.  Life was easier but held more accountable.  Life was simple and fraught with troubles but in the end, life had meaning and purpose.This story shows us a piece of Americana never to be seen again.  Family life as shown in this movie no longer exists which to me represents the sad passing of an institution which is in desperate need in our 21st century way of life.  It's really no wonder why this story runs a 24 hour Christmas marathon each year.  This is the big screen equivalent of a Norman Rockwell painting representing what American life was.\n",
      "This is a favorite at our house every holiday season. My wife LOVES this movie. It is the story as seen and narrated through the eyes of a young boy who deperately wants a BB gun for Christmas. He has a very traditonal, if not stereotypical, middle class family. He faces bullies and his family dynamics in a comical, yet sensitive way. Not really necessary to get the Blu-Ray when upconversion to 1080 would be just fine. No significant improvements were made in producing the Blu-Ray. Not even the added features were very good, useful, or entertaining. You do get to see the actors twenty years later, and a bit of commentary on the making of the movie is mildly interesting.\n",
      "It is a great story especially for an old guy that grew up in the forties.  Two things I always wanted for Christmas was a Red Rider BB Gun and a Lionel train but never got.  We were just too poor.  The smoke belching furnace, getting into fights with neighborhood bullies, brought back memories long forgotten.  But the best part of the story was the leg lamp, and the Chineese Christmas dinner.  This is sure to be a much watched classic for the Christmas season\n",
      "There is not much that hasn't already been said about this beloved Christmas tale!  It is a blend of humor and pathos, taking us back to those wonder years when all we wanted was to be a part of EVERYTHING!  How many of you have ever sent box-tops from cereal packages to Battle Creek, Michigan??  And what did you get?  A cardboard cut-out, a plastic ring, or some kind of \"Authentic Certificate\"?!As I've already said, therre isn't much left -- except, there can't be an original \"Leg Lamp\" left at ANY garage sale in the contiguous 49 States!But you can still get a Red Ryder BB Rifle @ your local Big Box Store...  Not to mention Amazon!  It's all about reliving those golden years of childhood, with the highs and lows that often followed one another quite closely.  This film captures the essence of family and friends, the magic of Christmas and our association with the gifts it brings, and the things that we remember (both good and bad) about our early days...  What's not to enjoy?  A true classic!Made to enjoy while sitting in your favorite recliner with the safety belt fastened -- or you'll roll on the floor laughing!\n",
      "My Favorite because It comes on Every Year in December. They Say it's The Number 1 Movie on The block.\n",
      "This is a classic for any fan of Holiday films. I can see why it is shown so often around the Holidays. The story quality and acting are all first rate. A must have.\n",
      "\"You'll shoot your eye out.\" How manytimes did Ralphie hear that? Well worththe time to see, any season of the year.Poor Schwartz got blamed for everything!\"Ho, ho, ho...\"\n",
      "I already have this on DVD, but thought I would upgrade to BluRay, as this is one of my favorite holiday movies.  I watch it at least twice every Christmas.  I was surprised to see that the quality was noticeable better than the upconverted DVD.  I'm glad I made the purchase.  The audio could be better, it only has a single channel mono recording.  My receiver does a pretty good job of post mixing this to 7.2, but I'm sure the studio could have done a better job with the track.\n",
      "This classic is wonderful,and now complete on dvd.It is a family tradition at our house. Own it for your own!\n",
      "Few other Christmas movies have so little to do with Christmas, but so much to do with the joys and pains of childhood.  Most people will find instant connections, and hours of laughter with the bizarrely unique characters of \"A Christmas Story.\"\n",
      "What an amazingly funny family story.  Revisiting the movie annually at Christmas time with my children  will help reinforce some of my family values.\n",
      "Each year, during the holiday season, I so look forward to once again settling down to enjoy this wonderful Christmas classic!\n",
      "It's funny how this little made-for-TV movie has become a Christmas standard in our household. We've all pretty much memorized but still laugh at it every year when it comes time to see it again.\n",
      "A classic Christmas must-watch film.  It brings back memories of Christmas for anyone that grew up in the 1940's or the 1950's.\n",
      "This is easily my favorite christmas movie ever.  It is about a little boy named Ralphie who wants a BB Gun for christmas.  But his parents keep telling him that he'll shoot his eye out. A few of my favorite parts in the movie were when Ralphie got his mouth washed out with soap after saying the F word, then of course there was the part when the mother broke the lamp,  but I'd have to say my very favorite part was when they were in the japanese restaurant and the choir sang, Deck the Harrs with Boughs of Horry Fa Ra Ra Ra Ra Ra Ra Ra Ra!  This is a must for anybody who likes funny movies.Enjoy!\n",
      "It's a tradition in my home to watch this movie every Christmas Eve. When I got rid of cable tv, I was wondering how I was going to keep this tradition going. Thanks to Amazon Prime Video, I now own it and can watch it whenever I want.\n",
      "A Christmas Story is another must watch movie at Christmas time.  Such a classic, and it's wonderful that it comes from a child's perspective.\n",
      "but I got so burnt out on it being repeated all day long when we had a dish that I figured I could do without it. But nooooo, the wife, the kids, and the grandkids have to see this one a few times every Christmas season.Just between you and I, though, I just don't feel the love from the leg lamp anymore.\n",
      "Love the movie.  My children grew up watching this.  They are now 30 and 28 years old.  I still enjoy watching this movie.  It is a Christmas tradition.\n",
      "How can one enjoy the Christmas season without viewing this outstanding movie.  Growing up in this era and getting a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas makes this movie even better.\n",
      "Nostalgic, good clean family fun. This movie is so well done it will go down in history as one of the top ten Christmas movies. If you have not seen this movie yet, I feel sorry for you.  If you watch it and you don't like it, then I really feel sorry for you.  I'm not a \"Lifetime Channel\" kind of guy and this is not that type of movie, but it is heartwarming, funny, nostalgic, clean, and entertaining for young and old alike.\n",
      "This is my all time favorite Christmas movie.  I watched it Christmas Eve with my grandson and he loved it.  He asked me if he had to wait until Christmas time to watch it.  I sent him his own copy.  The joy of Christmas should be experienced all year.\n",
      "A true classic, in the best sense of the word.  It's not a \"stuffy\" classic that everyone admires but no one actually enjoys.  It's not a classic in that it's a movie your grandparents really admire...but you have no use for.  Another word for CHRISTMAS STORY would be \"timeless.\"  I have seen this movie nearly every year since it first came out on the big screen 20 years ago.  I enjoy it EVERY TIME.  All the classic comic moments remain hilarious even now.Tongue stuck to flagpole.  The bully with the yellow eyes...and his comeuppance.  The sexy lamp.  The frightening Santa.  It's all there.  Saying \"oh fudge!\" The movie had a beautiful feel of nostalgia when it came out, and it has the same feel today.  I think for many viewers, this movie has come to define what small town, depression era America was like.  Innocent in all the best ways.Oh, did I mention the dog and turkey scene?  Or the \"how to the piggies eat\" scene?Anyway, this is the one movie about Christmas that everyone has seen.  I can mention it to people who think high-art is THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS and they recall CHRISTMAS STORY with fondness.  I can mention it to people who normally only see films with sub-titles, and they \"ooooh\" with misty eyes at their favorite memories.Truly, there isn't a single scene in the movie that's stinker.  It's one of the leanest, meanest movies you'll ever see.  The fat was trimmed very well indeed.Peter Billingsley as Ralphie is perfect in the role.  This kid is almost as big an icon of Christmas entertainment as the Grinch!  Darren McGavin, a favorite of mine, is just terrific as the crusty father with the flair for expletives.  The list could go on.  Not a single role is miscast or forgettable.If by some chance you haven't seen it and can't decide whether you should or not...just go ahead and buy it.  Once you've seen the movie...it'll become a part of YOUR Christmas tradition too!(One very tiny note of warning: the movie doesn't deal with the religious aspects of Christmas one little bit.  It is a totally secular holiday, if this film is to be believed.  If you want a show that remembers the Christ in Christmas...then the Charlie Brown Christmas special needs to be under your tree this year.)\n",
      "Phenominal! A must buy!!!!!! I would purchase again and again and again! You have to buy this great movie!!! Make it a part of your yearly tradition to sit down and watch this movie with your family!\n",
      "Great movie.  Bought one for each ofthe kids (and their family).  .  .  .  .  ..  .  .\n",
      "Try to watch this every Christmas season. Great family entertainment. It might be somewhat advanced for children under the age of 6.\n",
      "This movie is now on our Must watch list at Christmas.Excellant. The Family watches it over and over. Great Fun, and well done.\n",
      "Acknowledging that reviewing anything is a very subjective business, I must say that this movie takes me back to my own childhood so accurately that I get lost in it almost immediately. Further, it is a delightful journey. I would recommend it to anyone - those who lived it: late 1930s to 1950s - and those who can relate: includes just about anyone. This movie is truly timeless. I would recommend it for a night of warm feelings and lots of laughter; like anything else, best shared, but if you are alone, you will feel less so. Sweet, funny memories on a disk.\n",
      "We watch it every year at christmas time with the grand kids and they get a kick out of it as much as we do\n",
      "What I like most about this film is the way it brings me back to the childhood days of Christmas. If you still remember the awe and magic of getting that special gift, you'll enjoy watching this movie bring it to life.Billingsley is wonderful and will have you rolling - no matter how many times you've seen it. And to me, that's what makes this movie a classic - you can watch it over and over again and it doesn't get old. A modern Christmas classic!\n",
      "It's a classic Christmas story from a kids point of view. You can't stop laughing. The kids and the adults are totally natural.\n",
      "This movie really doesn't need a review.  This dvd is one of the best Christmas movies of all time.  It puts you in a good mood, makes  you laugh out loud.  It captures real life situations and memories of days gone by.  Recommend this movie to all, very enjoyable for all ages.  Thanks, Robert.\n",
      "\"A Christmas Story\" is one of the true classics of American Cinema. I am admittedly not very big on most Christmas themed movies (too commercial), but I make a big exception here. Adapted from Jean Shepherd's wry book \"In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash\" and set in the American midwest of the 1940s, the movie follows young Ralphie, perfectly portrayed by Peter Billingsley, his family and friends during a youthful Christmas season.During the course of the film we get to see typical childhood problems through the eyes of Ralphie. The problems include dealing with a neighborhood bully, enduring hideous Christmas presents (most notably the pink bunny suit, which is not to be missed), and the dreaded 'triple dog dare.' A brilliant cast is directed by veteran director Bob Clark. The parents in this film embody the no-nonsense, yet loving, parents of period America, in this case played to perfection by Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin. The highlight of the movie for me is EASILY the delivery of the dad's 'major award,' and his wife's acute embarrassment when it is placed in the living room window. (That's all I am going to say about the matter: if you haven't seen the movie, this scene alone is worth the asking price.)The recurring theme through the movie is the angst induced by being repeatedly told that the one gift that Ralphie truly wants, a Daisy Red Ryder BB Gun ('with a compass in the stock and a thing that tells time') is off limits with the sentence \"You'll shoot your eye out.\" (Even the deranged department store Santa gives this same warning in another masterstroke.) In the end Dad turns out to be way more of a softy than we would have ever taken him for, and Ralphie has the best Christmas ever, despite the 'Bumpus hounds' devouring their Christmas dinner.For the 2 CD set, you get the movie (of course) and some truly wonderful extras, most notably a documentary \"Another Christmas Story\" which interviews Clark, Billingsley (who looks exactly the same as an adult), and many other cast members about the making of the film. Also included is a fun trivia game (I got one question wrong), and the mini documentaries \"A History of the Daisy Red Ryder,\" and \"Get a Leg Up,\" which irrevocably demonstrates that humor is alive and well in America.This is a classic! Get in the Christmas spirit and buy this film!\n",
      "When I was asked by a freind to get her this video for Christmas, the first place I thought about getting it was Amazon.. Went on line and there it was.  Service was quick and I received the video faster than I expected..\n",
      "We love this movie.  It reminds us of our childhood Christmas!  It was a simpler time then!  We watch if every year.\n",
      "And so it happens that the media moguls have conspired once again to recreate yet another of our national traditions:  the annual reprise of a motion picture that has been blessed and certified by the entertainment  industry as a \"classic.\"  Only rather than let the test of time  determine what films are worthy of this especial classification, it is  instead forced down our throats with unrelenting promotional hype and  non-stop broadcasting, as is frequently done with \"A Christmas  Story\" on any of several Ted Turner-infected stations.  But this time,  the moguls got it right.\"A Christmas Story\" is fast becoming a  Christmas tradition, where families gather around the television to enjoy  the warm sentiments and precise humor that decorate this film much as they  would gather around the Christmas tree to open presents.  And the reason is  simple.  \"A Christmas Story\" brings us back in touch with our  youth and the time of our life when we could daydream, feel carefree and  unbridled.  I have never seen another film that so perfectly captures the  unassuming, innocent imagination of a child and portray it on screen.  Who  cannot relate to little Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) and his desire for a  Red Rider BB gun?  We all felt the same way at one time or another for the  toy we had our own hearts set on, and the bitter disappointment when our  mother gave us her own rendition of \"You'll shot your eye  out.\"Jean Shepherd's heartwarming tale is filled with hysterical  anecdotes and memorable characters like the father (Darren McGavin) and his  \"tapestry of obscenities that, as far as we know, is still floating in  space over Lake Michigan.\"  Don't worry, his \"obscenities\"  are mumbled and indiscernible.  And the scene with Ralphie and Santa Claus  in the shopping mall is so side-splittingly funny that I would urge you  refrain from drinking beverages while watching it.  One slightly  disappointing observation was the lack of anything religious or suggestive  of Christmas' true meaning anywhere in the film.  But if we should ever  need a quick reminder, we can always look to Linus in \"A Charlie Brown  Christmas.\"\n",
      "This was the perfect gift for family fun this year and hopefully years to come. There is never a shortage of this movie on television over Christmas time, but I couldn't reisist the added bonus of the tin, cookie cutters etc. included in this package. I would recomend this to anyone wanting to add memories to their Christmas'.\n",
      "The timeless telling of Christmas time through the eyes of a child with a little Walter Mitty in him. A must see every year.\n",
      "I live in Cleveland and this is one of the sites we visited!!  You can go on a tour and even take your own pics! I have several that show me holding the Red Rider bb gun and also holding the leg up out of the box, pic of me under sink and sitting at the table reading paper!\n",
      "A Christmas Story is a lovely movie sure to boost up one's holiday spirit. It's an excellent movie for families to watch together in their living rooms on Christmas Day. Children are sure to enjoy it along with their parents.The movie takes place during the holiday season of the 1940s and is about a nine-year-old child named, \"Ralph Parker\" who longs for a Red Rider BB Gun to have for a Christmas present. However, there is one obstacle he would have to face in order to receive this gift: His mother doesn't approve of BB guns! But Ralph is determined to get past that obstacle by persuading Santa to give him the BB Gun for Christmas.A Christmas Story is the movie I would definitely recommend for people to watch whenever the holiday season comes.\n",
      "i did'nt think the movie industry could produce a movie with such simple charm.  and the script captured so much from that era.  for me it was so special.  rob\n",
      "Love this movie - old classic that I had to show my kids.  They loved it and my wife and I enjoy it like it's the first time we are seeing it every time.  I would recommend this movie to anyone and I think it should be considered as a must-see in modern holiday movie libraries.\n",
      "This is by far my favorite holiday movie.  Ralphie is an All American kid in search of \"an official Red Ryder, carbine action, two-hundred shot range model air rifle\".  Hilarious!\n",
      "One of the best all time Christmas movies.  Good family fun.  Good gut busting adventures of a young boy and quest for the ultimate Christmas prize.\n",
      "My son who is now 48 still watches this movie every Christmas...what better as a gift in Blue Ray to be shown to his Grandchildren\n",
      "Watching is a Christmas tradition at our house, however I was disappointed that this wasn't covered under my Prime membership. Great movie, but come on Amazon really, $2.99 for a movie this old?\n",
      "My family's and I have been obsessed with this movie for years... A classic! Some dry/sarcastic humor... But excellent. Appropriate for the whole family.\n",
      "This has to be one of the best christmas movie I've ever seen. PERIOD.\n",
      "it's nice to see this classic in semi-HD. From what I've read, the original film was a lower budget movie, and therefore the original picture picture quality was never going to allow a great transfer to BlueRay. I wasn't expecting a super great version and can't compare the PQ to the non-HD DVD version, but was pleasantly surpriced it was very good. The extras are nothing to write home about, but if you're a big fan of the movie and don't currently own it on DVD, it's a great disc to have for the holidays. Beats the heck out of the broadcast TV version!\n",
      "This is my absolute #1 all time favorite Christmas Movie and I never see this Classic flick ever being overtaken by a remarkably memorable Christmas movie. Must Buy\n",
      "Enjoyed watching the movie with our grandchildren. We live in Cleveland, Ohio so the connection with Cleveland added to our interest.\n",
      "DVD was brand new.  This is probably the 30th time I've watched this movie.  TMC often have it as a marathon on Christmas.\n",
      "I love A Christmas Story. I watch it every year for Christmas. Almost drive my family crazy with it :)\n",
      "I'll rate the product, but I won't provide a \"testimony\" for it. You will have to make do with my star rating.\n",
      "The family enjoys it every year and it never gets old. A glimpse into the Christmas of our parents and grandparents.\n",
      "Watched this with our kids and now watching it with the grandchildren.  Lots of fun to enjoy as a family tradition!!\n",
      "Great movie that we watch every Christmas along with \"A Child's Christmas in Wales\" and \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" A buy!\n",
      "I agree with a prior poster who said \"A Christmas Story\" may be the funniest movie they've ever seen.Our fam watches this each year at Christmas and we laugh until we turn colors and roll off the couch. Few  movies have the capacity to make me laugh hysterically, but this is one of  them.The father's mumbled obscenities as he descends into the basement  to make non-stop adjustments to the coal furnace damper is a classic. That  alone is worth the price of the movie. McGavin (the Dad) must have  practiced that bit for months. That man has a gift.And when Ralphie says  \"the *f* word\" - his mother demands to know where he learned such  vile language. The answer he wants to say is - \"from Dad,\" but  instead, he gives up a friend as the culprit and the scene that follows is  so very funny.Anyone who ever grew up with parents will love this  movie. It is satire at its best but on the cutting edge of truth.This  Christmas, I gave \"The Christmas STory\" away as a gift to several  friends and family. It is a classic unlike any other.\n",
      "This is a Christmas must-see! Any age group would enjoy it...a family classic. I was pleased I could find it on Amazon.com...and for a great price. Well-worth the purchase!\n",
      "What can be said, an instant xmas classic, my 5 year old loves it, it's a must see every year! You'll shoot your eye out kid!!!!\n",
      "Watch it every Christmas, never gets old. My favorite part is when they have Christmas dinner at the Chinese restaurant.\n",
      "Seen it too many times for a five-star rating, but it's still enjoyable.  For the few who haven't come across it yet, it's worth your time, but perhaps not your money as it always on some cable channel or another throughout December.\n",
      "No holiday season is perfect without at least one viewing of A Christmas Story.  This was actually to replace my VHS version.\n",
      "This is my very favorite movie and a must see during the Holidays!  Fun to see the olden days!  Innocent clean fun!\n",
      "If you haven't seen this movie, your missing a great one.  Our family makes it a point to watch this movie every Christmas.\n",
      "This is a classic. There is a reason they play this movie for 24 hours straight on Christmas Day on AMC. A family tradition in our house to watch.\n",
      "I gave it as a present so I don`t know how it looked. Basing my review on a love for the movie as a whole.\n",
      "This is one of the best Christmas movies ever.  I have enjoyed this movie for years. It makes a great gift as we'll.\n",
      "A good story that guys can relate to. If you enjoyed this, try[...] it ismore on the romantic side.\n",
      "This is one of our all-time favorite videos, and we watch it at least once each Christmas season.  It's a great, funny, nostalgic movie.  Every year we laugh at the precious leg lamp in the window.  We purchased several of them for some of our friends about our age (60's) who had never seen this movie, and all of them liked it as well.  Even though we older ones can relate better to the movie, I think people of all ages, including children, can enjoy the humor in it.\n",
      "Comparable to \"The sound of music\".Not available in Europe (The United kingdom does not consider itself part of Europe)\n",
      "My kids ask to watch it year round (age 4 and 6)  I remember this movie when I was a child and I still love it!\n",
      "We watched the movie again this year, probably for the 15th time and laughed out loud as usual; so I guess it's worth it.\n",
      "This movie is right up there with A Christmas Carol.  It is on TV Guide's 10 best Christmas Movies also. And It is always on television every year a million times for one reason....people love it! So add a true christmas  classic into your household, and watch it a million times!!!\n",
      "If you don't like A Christmas Story you should be stranded on a deserted island like Tom Hanks in Castaway.\n",
      "This is a must have in my Christmas DVD archives!  Everyone should purchased this one! It's for the entire family to watch. Thanks Amazon!\n",
      "One of the many must see movies for me during the holidays. It's not my favorite, but it is definitely a tradition!\n",
      "Love this movie. We always watch this movie as a family on the Friday evening after Thanksgiving. A tradition that began when our children were little.  They are now grown and we're still watching this movie together to start off our holiday season. We love the old time memories that the film brings back. And who would not love the leg lamp or its demise!!  The \"Chinese Turkey\" is priceless!! A great family movie!!  Enjoy!!\n",
      "I have to watch this movie every year.  So many gems -- the dog and the turkey, the Chinese restaurant and the lamp.\n",
      "This is my son's favorite movie for the Christmas season. I love to watch it with him and now my Grand kids love it too!\n",
      "Great story about growing up in America with real life experiences.  My daughters got me the full size \"Major Award\" Leg lamp for Christmas this tear. It is displayed in our front window.  This is my favorite Christmas movie\n",
      "Yes, indeed - this film brings back many memories, and many have indeed grown up with this nostalgic flick. All little Ralphie wants for Christmas is a Red Ryder BB-gun; he obsesses over it, frequently falling into daydreams over it, even. But, his mother insists that he'll only hurt himself (the infamous line \"You'll shoot your eye out\" runs rampant throughout the film.) Indeed, spend a nostalgic, laugh-out-loud hilarious Christmas with Ralphie, his school pals, and his ever-eccentric family. A Christmas classic for the ages.\n",
      "How many movies can you really enjoy with the young people in your life?  This is one of the few.  I watched this with great reluctance, and found myself absolutely loving it!  Believe me, you really won't be nauseated! You will laugh!\n",
      "\"A Christmas Story\" is a 1983 movie that has become a Christmas classic. This wonderful movie that takes place in the 1940's is about 9 year Ralphie, played by Peter Billingsley, and his dream of receiving a genuine Red Ryder 200-shot Carbine Action Air Riffle for Christmas.  Of course his mother, played by Melinda Dillon, is against Ralphie getting a bb gun for fear that 'he'll shoot his eye out'.  Ralphie's father otherwise known as The Old Man, played by Darren McGavin, is a gruff, childlike man who you'll find very entertaining.This movie is funny and very entertaining.  It reminds you of your past Christmas' and those special memories that you'll cherish forever. The acting and directing of this film is superb.\n",
      "greatest xmas movie ever, brought me back to the 1940s when I was a kid and made me think of happy times\n",
      "This is the BEST holiday movie to date...It has everything...laughs, drama, and it's heartwarming just the same...brings back alot of memories....LOVED IT!!\n",
      "I've heard so much about this movie, yet had never seen it.  We enjoyed it.  I can see why it has become a classic.\n",
      "I just love this movie!  It has become a Christmas classic in my home.  But I love to watch it even if it isn't Christmastime!  Delightfully written and the young man who wants the BB gun is soo cute and expressive!\n",
      "I just had to get my own DVD, I watch this movie every year, the 24 hour marathon.\n",
      "Anyone who looks forward to the annual \"A Christmas Story Marathon\" - 24 hours straight of this incredibly realistic and comic view of a boys' life at the age of 9 during (what I'm guessing is) the early 50s.  A hallarious movie for everyone!\n",
      "Having an older TV, I was glad, to find the full screen version!!  Although, I have seen this classic every year, i never owned one!!  NOW!!!  I rock!!\n",
      "Cute kid's film that I can't imagine how my husband and I missed.  He only likes very, very creative kid's films.  I understand that \"formulaic\" is important for kids (and sometimes for me too)!  Goodness though, I am disappointed in AMAZON!  There are way too many films that IMHO should be in AMAZON PRIME and they are not.\n",
      "It's a family favorite and this company sent it so speedy. I'm very impressed. I wanted our son moved to Seattle to get by Christmas & I think it will arrive by then. THANK YOU!!!!\n",
      "This movie is a Christmas tradition.  Mom, Dad and all the kids in it are great but Ralphie is top-notch.  One year at work we started quoting our favorite lines from it and it was amazing what different people came up with.\n",
      "Was a gift for my daughter & family. They LOVE it too! They had watched on TV, now they can have a marathon if they wish!\n",
      "Amazon has combined the reviews for the Blu-ray and standard DVD versions of this set, which aren't exactly the same in their features.  This review is for the Blu-ray version.  My review of the standard DVD version is here too, so be sure you're reading the one you're interested in.The movie is excellent, a Christmas classic (see below).  Should you upgrade to the new Ultimate edition if you already have the 2006 Blu-ray edition?  That depends on how much you like memorabilia.  The new edition is a repackaging of the 2006 edition, with a couple new non-DVD extras:-- a collectible retro Christmas cookie tin (the container for the set)-- a strand of leg-lamp Christmas lights (Blu-ray exclusive)Those look like fun, if you're into that kind of stuff.  Amazon has a photo of the tin and a second photo that shows the tin and the leg-lamp lights.  (The announcement for this set said that the items from the standard DVD set (here) would be included in this one, but that isn't correct.)The Blu-ray DVD won't be remastered from the previous one.  The video quality of the 2006 release was only fair for hi-def, soft with fairly good color, with fair mono sound.The 2006 Blu-ray didn't include everything that was on the HD or the 2-disc SD set.  Here's what's actually included:-- audio commentary by director/co-writer Bob Clark and star Peter Billingsley (Ralphie)-- Another Christmas Story featurette, includes interviews with Clark and a few members of the cast-- Get a Leg Up featurette, about the making and ongoing sale of the (in)famous leg lamp-- A History of the Daisy Red Ryder featurette, on the object of great desire's actual history-- original theatrical trailerThe features from earlier editions that aren't included are trivia and decoder games, readings (audio only) from Jean Shepherd, and an ad for the real leg lamp.Now, about the really good stuff, the movie.  A Christmas Story is that odd film that appeals to a cross-section of viewers who often can't agree on what to watch.  Fans of sweet Christmas cheer are happily joined by people with a more jaundiced eye to the holiday.  To be sure, the movie leans more to the sweet than the sour, but it has enough edge and good-natured twistedness to please some of our darker Christmas angels too.  It conveys a genuinely warm nostalgia and some sharp, sometimes pretense-deflating observations about human nature.The story is set at some indefinite time around 1940 in an Indiana town approaching the holidays.  Young Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wants only one thing for Christmas, the Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action 200-Shot Lightning Loader Range Model Air Rifle with a compass in the stock.  (That is, a BB gun, a very particular one.)  He plans carefully well in advance how to lay the groundwork for this while avoiding the dreaded rebuff, but almost everyone says it anyway: \"You'll put your eye out!\"  The relentless struggle for the one true gift develops alongside several other small stories and amusing details, a tongue-on-frozen-pole triple-dog dare, facing the local bully, the notorious leg lamp, the Santa slide, Peking Duck for Christmas, and several others, each memorable in itself.The actors aren't very well known, but they're all just right.  There is narration throughout, representing an older Ralphie, done by the originator of the story, Jean Shepard, also just right.This movie, made in 1983, has gradually become a favorite Christmas classic, now shown in an annual 24-hour Christmas marathon on cable, which attracts a huge number of viewers.  If you've never seen it, give it a try, even if you have a little Scrooge in you, and you'll probably enjoy it.\n",
      "I have loved watching this movie every year since I first saw it.  I finally got around to seeing ACS2 and actually felt they did a good job.\n",
      "Best Christmas movie ever. Love to see it every year for the holidays go it this year.. Good family movie\n",
      "\"A Christmas Story\" has been a part of my holiday tradition for the last ten years. This movie puts me in the Christmas spirit year-round! All Ralphie Parker wants for Christmas is a Red Ryder BB Gun. Ah, if life were that simple. His 1940's Midwest family is humorously dysfunctional: his father stumbles around yelling garbled curses at the malfunctioning furnace and worshipping \"The Leg Lamp,\" his little brother Randy is an annoying nuisance whose sole ability seems to be whining, and all the grownups in his life don't take him seriously. Throw in some school bullies, a wild imagination, and plenty of Christmas spirit, and you end up with the wonderful mix that is \"A Christmas Story.\" Every year my family will gather around the TV, with a fire in the fireplace and glasses of eggnog. We usually watch this at least three times a year: after Thanksgiving, on Christmas Eve and on Christmas Day. There is something magical about returning to the trials and tribulations of childhood, of the yearning and pleading and begging after that one Christmas gift that you HAVE to have, the sacred ritual of visiting Santa Claus at the mall, choosing that perfect Christmas tree (even if it ends up looking like Charlie Brown's), that first magical snowfall, the whole family decorating the tree, waiting for Santa and finally running down the stairs about as quietly as an elephant on Christmas morning in the quest to be the first to unwrap the presents in a frenzy of knotted ribbons and flying wrapping paper (hopefully NOT finding a pink bunny costume like poor Ralphie). This is a gentle, heartwarming, humorous tale of Christmas. It is rated PG due to minor swear words (and a narrowly averted major swear word)... and an imaginary shootout with BB guns. But it is a movie for kids and parents alike that celebrates family and the wondrous holiday known as Christmas. Happy Holidays!\n",
      "Lighten up the holiday season with this hilarious and heartwarming holiday classic. An almost magical story based on narrator Jean Sheapard's childhood adventures, this one is a classic in my family and should definately be one in yours. If you don't know the fear of a triple dog dare or the embarrassment of a young boy in a bunny suit you are MISSING OUT! It just isn't the holiday season without this movie. This film features great performances from Peter Billingsly as young cynic Ralphie, who only wants one thing for Christmas: A Red Rider BB Gun and Melinda Dillon as the American mom not to mention the father and Ralphie's hysterical little brother (\"Show Mommy how the piggies eat!\"). It also makes great use of the 'Peter and the Wolf' symphony. The film just stands out as a holiday classic because it's nostalgic air is so realisticly dreamy. There are charming and understanding moments (when the Mom sticks the soap in her mouth comes to mind) and all of Ralphie's daydreams are whimsical childhood fantasies. So this holiday season get in the spirit and habit of watching this flick.\n",
      "This is a family favorite.  Fun to watch each year. This classic will make you laugh & remember your own childhood holidays.\n",
      "Best movie to have ever existed.  A classic christmas tradition in my house.  Sometimes the TBS marathon just isn't enough.\n",
      "You almost don't really need to buy this movie since every Christmas they show a 24-hour marathon of it on TNT--but I digress. This is a cute movie. It pretty much defines every kid's Christmas wishes and how disappointing it can be when you don't get what you want. My favorite scenes are Ralphie and \"the old man\" changing a tire--\"Oh, fuuuddgge\"--but we all know what he REALLY said, and the Christmas dinner at the Chinese restaurant--\"Fa ra ra ra...\" Good nostalgic fun. A trip down Memory Lane for older generations, but the story is one kids, young and old, can relate too. Now hurry up kid, the store is closing!\n",
      "This movie is wonderful. It is based on a book of memoirs by Jean Shepard. I had the great honor of being Mr. Shepard's neighbor. His memoirs take place in my home town. Seeing this movie is wonderful because I know these people and these places. They have been modified, of course, to make this wonderful film, but I still go to Flick's Tap on Hohman Avenue! It was a great film that brought my town into light....even in my mind.\n",
      "This was a present.  The movies as always was great and we loved the DVD with the extras! This is a must see timeless tradition!\n",
      "It is a family tradition to watch this silly Christmas movie every year. So I am passing this tradition on to the next generation.\n",
      "This movie makes me laugh.  I love the narration and the humor and the lengths the little boy would go to to get his bb gun.Don't shoot your eye out!\n",
      "This is a MUST SEE family movie! It was top of my grandson's list & wewatched it several times!!\n",
      "I watched this film growing up, and to this day I LOVE it! Funny enough, I wasn't a huge fan of it as a young child, but since then, and after having established Holiday traditions of my own, I love this movie so much. It brings back memories, makes me feel at home, and brings a smile to my face. What a fantastic, all American, classic Christmas movie. There will never be a Christmas in my home when you won't find this on the TV.\n",
      "I purchased this disc because I had seen the movie many years ago and wanted to have a permanent copy. My family and I originally viewed the film because we were from Cleveland, Ohio, where part of the picture was filmed. We were customers of Higbee's Department Store,which is also featured in this movie.  Darren McGavin is one of my favorite actors, and he does a wonderful job as the father of the young lad who wants a Red Ryder rifle. This production is a heart-warming, funny and accurate look back at a time when life was simple and fun. It is delightful to watch and I highly recommend it for a look back at Christmas in a time past.\n",
      "If you haven't seen this yet, I recommend catching it on TV (I think on TBS). They run it 24 hours during Christmas day.\n",
      "This is a good family movie.  It is great to watch when the weather outside keeps you in the house.\n",
      "Being born in 1948,this movie brings back many fond memories of that time and how we lived back in the 40's and 50's and how special Christmas was for us during this time period.When I watch my Christmas movies,during the seaon,it's not unusual for me to watch this movie twice for the nostalgic effect of when I was a kid in a small Pennsylvania town of about 800 people who all decorated their house's and put up tree's for the season.Even the cars in this movie were still around and the house's looked the same.This movie is a great escape from the sick world we now have to live in.But I seem to have the capability to escape it all when I watch this and my other Christmas movies.Hope other's can do that,too.\n",
      "Great classic!\n",
      "Excellent movie.  I especially enjoyed the part when Ralph's father won the \"Leg Lamp\".  The movie gave me a chanbe to see what life was like when my parents grew up.\n",
      "This is a fun great story! It also reminds us of simpler times when kids used their imagination and were content finding things to do instead of staying in the house in front of the TV. Brings back wonderful childhood memories of playing outside and enjoying the Christmas season.\n",
      "There are two kinds of people in this world... those who love a \"A Christmas Story\" and those that don't.  This is one of our family's Christmas favorites.  This purchase in BluRay was to upgrade our vido collection.\n",
      "How believable and true can a movie get - all the way from the Daisy air rifle (which a friend of mine still has to this day) to the red wagons and immobilizing snowsuits.  One can see this movie all year long and feel good.  Anyone growing up in that period deserves to relive his childhood and share in the wonderful experiences.  There's even a happy ending!\n",
      "This is a great movie for the whole family.  It wouldn't be Christmas withoutthis movie.  It's funny, nostalgic, a trip down memory lane for some of us, and a view of the \"olden days\" for the rest.\n",
      "Do I need to write a review?  This movie is well known and been out since the 80's if I have to write a review for this you must have been under a rock since the 80's.  Merry Christmas!\n",
      "How can you go wrong with \"A Christmas Store.\"  Classic movie that I grew up on!\n",
      "If you have not seen this movie, then you are missing out. This movie has been a holiday tradition since i was a kid and now i get to share it with my child. You don't even have to watch it at christmas time, it's always a classic.\n",
      "In 1983, the greatest Christmas movie of all-time was released: \"A Christmas Story\". This movie is my personal all-time favorite Christmas movie. When the Christmas season is coming, I can't stop watching the movie from November 30 - December 31. It's the only Christmas movie I can't get sick of. The cast, the story and the comedy is OUTSTANDING!!The movie starts out in a small Indiana town in the 1930's. Here we meet Ralphie Parker (Billingsley), a nine-year-old who is desperate to get his hands on the perfect Christmas gift: An official Red Rider Carbon-Action 200-shot loader range model air rifle. As badly as he wants this gift more than anything, his mom, teacher, and a mall Santa Claus say \"You'll shoot your eye out!\" That doesn't stop Ralphie from making his dream come true.As Christmas comes closer and closer, a bunch of mishaps happen between his friends, and his family. His friend Schwartz talked his other friend Flick into sticking his tounge to a flag pole, and his tounge got stuck. Then Ralphie beats up a school buly named Scut. His father (McGavin) wins a lamp that is in the form of a leg that he loves and nobody else does, including his warmhearted mother (Dillon). The really goofy side to his family is his cry-baby little brother Randy. He won't eat! He's always complaining and crying and his laugh is SO FUNNY! He's a typical six-year-old rugrat.Will Raplhie let a teacher, a mall Santa and even his own mother stop him from making his Christmas dream come true? You'll see. The movie really gets you into the holiday season. It's an EXCELLENT family movie. Everyone I know loves this movie. It's addicting! Your Christmas collection is not complete if you don't have this movie on your shelf. Even the T.V. station TNT does a 24-Hour marathon of \"A Christmas Story\" EVERY YEAR! Watch \"A Christmas Story\" and you will NOT be disappointed. Merry Christmas! Ho, Ho, Ho!\n",
      "No matter how many times you watch this you just have to laugh. A great movie to eliminate those holiday blues. I showed this in my office waiting room the other day and the laughter was never ending. The only problem was getting them out of the waiting room.\n",
      "From the All-American streets of Terre Haute, Indiana, come the story a boy and his one Christmas wish, A Red Rider BB Gun! This story definitely personalizes the  true American Christmas experience. The holiday movie for the family each year!\n",
      "Mom, the Old Man, Ralphie, Randy, Scut Farkas, the Major Award (which could be from Italy because it's marked \"Fragile\"--pronounced Fra-jee-lee), the furnace, the teacher. I'd triple dog dare you not to love this move, but that's a breach of etiquette. Let's just start with the double dog and go from there.  Oh, and try no to get your tongue stuck on the pole.It's perfection.  And I'll bet you a Chinese turkey on that.\n",
      "The season wouldn't be the same without this funny adaptation of childhood. I watch it every year and every year I find it funny.\n",
      "A really nice set, complete with cookie cutters, a recipe book, apron & a DVD.  I love it.  The price on amazon.com was much better than anywhere else,  half the price as e-bay sellers.LOVE IT!\n",
      "I LoVe ThIs MoViE!!!!!! I wAkE uP aT 4:00 a.M. oN cHrIsTmAs MoRnInG aNd WaTcH it! It's like that little weird kid that comes up to Ralphie in the mall, right when the Wizard of Oz characters have just left him alone, and the kid says, \"I like Wizard of Oz.\" ha ha that part cracks me up every time.\n",
      "A Christmas Story is a great christmas comedy that will trust me keep you laughing the whole entire time!!!!!!! Just in time  for the holidays!!!!!!! All i can really say is go out and pick yourself a copy of this hilarious holiday classic and put it in your movie collection its totally worth it!!!!!\n",
      "This is my all-time favorite Christmas movie.  I try to watch it every year at Christmas time.  It is good, clean, humorous and delightful.  Highly recommended.\n",
      "In a 1940's suburban household 11 year old Ralphie is dying to get a Red Ryder BB-GUN. \"You'll shoot yer eye out!\" his father tells him. He runs to his mother with her saying the same. Then Ralphie goes through his desperate last ditch effort to get his prize. Going to santa, and begging still just getting the \"You'll shoot yer eye out!\" Line. On christmas morning his father hands him a special package Could it be? You'll have to wait a see.Filled with comedy and Hijinks that will make you cherish this movie forever.  And always make sure you don't \"SHOOT YER EYE OUT!\"-SHAIKJA\n",
      "I have decided that Brian Wilson has creative control over the audio on all releases of this classic.  I was not so surprised that it was mono on VHS, but thought that the Anniversary VHS would be in stereo...nope.  1st DVD...saw a 1.0 DD track from a mile.  When I bought the 2-disc edition I thought finally a 5.1...nope.  Same with the Blu-Ray...but there is some improvement in picture quality; about like \"upconversion\".  Theoretically a THX neuralizer could put it in 7.1 as long as a pair of interconnect RCA's are running from your player to your receiver...\n",
      "There was more swearing in the original than the TV version I have always seen but still a fun movie!\n",
      "Wouldn't be Christmas with out this movie  It got here when promised.A family favorite.  Thank you amazon.yu are the best.\n",
      "I cannot rave enough about this movie. It is a family tradition to watch this show around Christmas, especially the 24-hour marathon. Ralphie and his quest to get a red ryder BB gun is the entire premise for this movie. Everyone is telling him he'll shoot his eye out if he had one. So he decides to ask Santa for it. His crazy father offers alot of humor as well. Plus, Ralphie and his friends have to deal with the neighborhood bully, Scudfarcus. It would be impossible to watch this and not want to watch it over and over. It brings such a smile on my face whenever I see it or think about it.\n",
      "I had sent this to my sister as she just loves the whole thing with \"The Christmas Story\" and she absolutely loved it.  She baked cookies with the cookie cutters and was a total hit with everyone that was lucky enough to receive the leg lamp & bunny cookies.She raved so much about how nice this set was --  that I ordered a set for our family - so glad I did.  If you are a Christmas Story fan then this has to be a MUST!!!  Shari in Cape Coral, Fl.\n",
      "We watch from 7:00 p.m. on Christmas Eve until 7:00 p.m. on Christmas Day every year.  It stays on all night long. It wouldn't be the same without it!\n",
      "Great Christmas time movie for all ages...  Good cast, great writing and lots of comedy  . a bit of nostalgia for the good old days...\n",
      "Brings me back to when I was a kid.  So much In the movie reminds me of my childhood.  From the bully with the yellow eyes and being chased down the alley, the Palmolive soap to wash your mouth out (which we got frequently), the snow suit where the little brother couldn't put his arms down (my sister had that red snow suit and the same problem, she walked to school with her arms in the air. Ha! She did look like she was going to pop), the dad who cussed at the furnace (how well I remember that), laying in all that Christmas wrap at the end of the frenzied unwrapping and hearing Dad say to Mama: \"My, gosh, would you look at all that mess!\"  I remember the meatloaf, mashed potatoes, the aroma of Mama's cooking drifting outside from time to time, and hearing the dogs barking away.  It kind of saddens me to watch it, not because it isn't a wonderful movie, but because I miss some of my growing up years, and this movie takes me back in time to the good and not so good parts of it.  Oh, and last but not least, the 'Red Ryder BB Gun', my brother had to have one, and the words of my Mama: \"You'll shoot your eye out!\"  Thanks for the memories Christmas Story, when I miss the days back when, I turn this on and for a brief moment am transported back to when things weren't so bad, or perhaps didn't seem to be..  Great movie, if and when it wears out, I will get another!\n",
      "I love this movie!  It's funny and suitable for the whole family.  A memory maker, for sure.  Everyone remembers where they were when Ralphie donned his pink bunny suit.  Wait til you see it!!\n",
      "this movie is timeless we watch it every year and get a laugh last year my father joined us and he says it was a highlight of the season\n",
      "Do people not understand what matted means yet? I mean come on!!! Its not hard...This movie was shot in 1 37 1 which equals to (fullscreen). The theatre version was matted, meaning they cut off the top and bottom which is intended...The tv (fullscreen) version is the original 1 37 1..So when you buy the widescreen version its the matted version, exactly the one saw in theatres...So for all you ppl who think this was a widescreen movie cut into fullscreen then cut again to widescreen are wrong wrong wrong!!! come on ppl!!!...Read the technical stuff about the movie before you make a bad review....Home Alone, Christmas Vacation and this movie all were shot in 1 37 1 then matted for theatres, so if you buy a widescreen matted version its the theatre version!!! Which is the correct version....\n",
      "This is a great classic Christmas movie! It's perfect for family movie night to get everyone in the Christmas spirit! I was very please to find this on blu-ray to add to our collection! :)\n",
      "i've never stopped laughing at this film. the picture quality is a little rough on the titles, but it cleans up shortly after.\n",
      "For some reason, every year I watch this movie.  It think it's very cute.  I enjoy watching it all the time.  I think the kids did great in the movie.\n",
      "This is a replacement. Somehow my other copy went missing so I had to get another one. It worked out great.\n",
      "fast shipping perfect condition…just didn't like the movie that's all ha ha it didn't live up to its hypethank you\n",
      "A friend of mine forced me to watch this film... the premise sounded stupid and I HATE sappy, stupid movies.  I was totally floored.  This is one of the funniest family films I have ever seen. This is not a modern-day  slapstick no-brainer comedy, but a reminiscent look into the simpler 1940s  when kids sat in front of the radio all night and dreamed of being  cowboys.Ralphie's (Peter Billingsley)  fantasy is to hold the Daisy  Brand Red-Ryder BB rifle in his hot little hands Christmas morning and his  life begins revolving around this fantasy as the holiday approaches. He  practices using the rifle with his hands, writes a school essay about it  and pesters everyone from his parents to Santa Claus to make sure it's  delivered under the chimney no later than December 24.Don't be misled by  the director (famous for \"Porky's\"), this is a family film. There  is one expletive used, which quite frankly could have been snipped in my  opinion, but the overall feel of this film is one of innocence, adventure  and fond Christmas memories.  I watch this film every year and laugh myself  sick everytime I do.  Remembering the way we used to think and perceive  things as a child is what this movie is about, and how in many ways, much  of what we thought makes a lot more sense than how we think now.Darren  McGavin's performance provides some of the most hilarious laughs... he's  constantly shifting from being a grumpy old man to a little kid in his  emotional rollercoaster ride of mid-life crisis and fatherhood in the  1940s.I can't recommend this film enough. My only regret is the lack of  extras on the DVD. How about an interview w/ the cast, especially now that  the kids have grown? How about out-takes? It's a sad shame that so often  film makers put their movies on DVD while paying no attention to what the  medium demands in relationship to content.\n",
      "Did not hear about this movie or see this until early nineties... Has been part of our Family Christmas movie collection ever since... love it!\n",
      "There's not much to add to all the fine reviews extolling the sheer perfection of this Jean Shepherd fantasy.  Someday the distributors will release a WIDESCREEN version with some extras that we've come to expect from DVD releases: background on the creators, outtakes & deleted scenes, etc., but for now we have to be satisfied with the bare bones version here.  I have no complaints about the film itself --- it is flawless.  Those grumps who want to stand out by seeing this movie as the exact opposite of its intention (not for kids? COME ON, GROW UP!) will not enjoy anything remotely clever on the level of CHRISTMAS STORY but, so what, the world is full of people who only think ADULTHOOD=MATURITY.  This movie will be enjoyed by all ages for years to come...let's hope Warner Bros. is listening and they put together a definitive edition---I'd buy it in a second!\n",
      "I received the item within 1 week of purchase. The item is even more beautiful than anticipated. It was a Christmas gift to my husband who had been looking for a storage container for honey.  He absolutely loves it.\n",
      "I bought this DVD to replace a Video Tape that came up missing after I moved.  The movie is a sweet look at a Christmas in the past. It reminded me of how life was like for a 9 year old boy, dreaming of owning a bb rifle. The movie is funny and has a great ending!  I would recommend it to my family and friends.\n",
      "This is the BEST Christnas movie ever made. It a A tradition in our house to watch it as many times as possible between Thanksgiving and C-mas; rule # 1- no watching of The Christmas Story at any other time of the year!!\n",
      "Holiday classic in our home!  Great time to re-live  and share so many childhood memories.  Wool snowsuits, getting tongues stuck on cold metal and of course \"you'll shoot your eye out\"!\n",
      "It's a classic.  It goes hand-in-hand with It's A Wonderful Life, the other 'chestnut' that everyone has seen at least a million times.  Except not everyone HAS seen this one...it's hard to believe, but there are still people out there who don't know what will happen if they get a BB gun for Christmas.  If you have someone who loves Christmas and who HASN'T seen this, give them them A Christmas Story...the gift that keeps on giving. Jimmy Stewart was never this funny.\n",
      "I haven't popped the disc in to watch the movie yet, but being a huge fan of the movie I've seen it a hundred times, so I'm going to review the products received, not the movie, deleted scenes, etc.Amazon clearly advertises the Blu-Ray comes with leg lamp lights and the DVD comes with cookie cutters, a cookbook, and apron.  For those of you who can't read, Amazon has even included pretty pictures and a video showing this.I pre-ordered mine back in August, and it was delivered the day of release.  The green tin can was in perfect condition, as well were the lights.  I was honestly expecting a rip-off strand of lights, something only 3-4' long, but this strand is appx 6'.  All lights work and the leg lamps look great, they'll go nicely on my desktop Christmas tree at work this year.\n",
      "This is a great family movie for young and old and with me, my children, and now grandchildren it will most likely always be a part of our Christmas tradition.\n",
      "Now before I even begin to review this movie, I would just like to clarify my title.  I call \"A Christmas Story\" the 2nd greatest Christmas movie of all time because in my opinion \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\" is the greatest Christmas movie of all time.Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's start the review!  This is a movie that unlike others, actually captures the true spirit of Christmas in every way possible.  Peter Billingsley stars as Ralphie, a young boy that cannot get his mind off of an official Red Ryder bb gun.  Right from the beginning of the film Ralphie is trying to hint to his parents what he wants for Christmas.  What makes this film really stand out is how it is told through the eyes and mind of a child.  You'll notice right off the bat, that the film does have a narrator, an older Ralphie.  But unlike other films, the narrator fits perfectly into the Christmas formula.Darren McGavin stars as Raplhie's strict and serious father.  This strictness however passes off as some of the best humor in the film.  You even feel like you're watching \"Married with Children\" at times because like Al Bundy, you just want great things to happen to McGavin.  But I will not give away plot details (even though everyone reading this has probably seen this movie over 20 times).As the story progresses the film continues and Ralphie is realizing how hard it is to try to convince his parents, teacher, and even Santa Clause, what a perfect gift the Red Ryder bb gun would make.  Each of these figures continues to haunt Ralphie with the classic saying, \"You'll shoot you're eye out kid!\".I honestly can't review this movie to make it sound even half as great as it truly is, so go watch this movie or even buy it because it can be wacthed hundreds of times without getting the least bit dull.  But don't watch it during summer becuase it will depress you and make you think of Christmas.  So grab some egg nog, sit by the tree and watch \"A Christmas Story\"!!!!!\n",
      "There are extremely popular films that I have resisted watching for one reason or another.  I see them on the video store shelves and I just resolve not to participate in whatever phenomenon made them into hits.  I don't apologize for that, since there must be people who do the same thing with just about every movie in America -- nothing gets 100% acceptance, right?  Right.Now I'm going to tell you  -- Go, and get A CHRISTMAS STORY, and see it.  It doesn't matter who or where you are, or how picky you may be, or what your preferences of films may be, or what you think about it, or how antisocial or contrary you may normally consider yourself to be.I don't care if your intellectual taste is high or low, smart or dumb, tasteful or kitschy, mainstream, radical or eclectic.  I don't care how you were brought up, or where, when, or in what race or creed.Go and get A CHRISTMAS STORY and see it.  See this movie.  Trust me, or don't trust me.  Just do it anyway.  You're welcome.A CHRISTMAS STORY is not only a universal delight, in terms of story, perfect casting, inspired directing and undeniable humanity.  It is the quintessential American movie about the Christmas experience and family life, like it or lump it, shop or don't shop, frown or smile, rich or poor, traditional or oddball.If you don't see this movie about a kid named Ralphie and his brother and his perfectly rendered mom and dad, you will eventually pass away and be the poorer for not ever having warmed your heart over the hearthfires of this very moving, perfect little American masterpiece.I'm not sure but what you don't have to have sampled this movie treat at least once in order to get into heaven.\n",
      "CLASSIC, brings my childhood Christmases right back into my heart! We've been watching this movie since it first came out and won't miss it every year.\n",
      "The Christmas Story is THE best Christmas film EVER made.Right next to Christmas Vacation is my opinion.This is great to watch around Christmas time,or any ol time of the year.Buy it and enjoy it :)\n",
      "This indy flick from the 80's quickly made it as one of the Christmas classics. I double dog dare you to buy it!\n",
      "This is a Christmas classic at our house. My oldest daughter watches the marathon on TV every year even though we have the dvd. She says \"it's different\". I ordered the blu ray for the blu ray player she is getting for Christmas. I know she'll love it.\n",
      "Watch this every year at Christmas it is just not Christmas without watching this each year. Makes me laugh each time!!\n",
      "these arrived as expected.  not much to say but the boy was pleased with them. what else can be said\n",
      "Great gift for Christmas. I would highly recommend this movie as a gift for friends who have young ones or are young at heart themselves. This is a wonderful story, so touching and cute, fun and silly. Great characters too. I recommend this so very very much as a gift. I won't go into too much of the story, because I think it will be better to just watch it yourselves. Every year I work to watch it at least once during the holidays, perhaps you will too once you get it, or your recipients will. Take care.\n",
      "Total Classic! My family has watched this every Christmas Holiday for years. We all love the Chinese restaurant scene... Deck the haws with boughs of hawrry fa ra ra ra ra - ra ra ra ra! We used to wait for it to come on during the holiday. This year we couldn't wait and just bought it. Miracle on 34th Street, Frosty, Rudolph, the Grinch and A Christmas Story are already out in our house.\n",
      "One of the very best Christmas stories.  Give yourself a treat and enjoy this lovely, humorous story every year.  You will not be disappointed.  Ralphie and his family are just wonderful. My granddaughter had this on her Christmas \"wish list\" and she loved it.  I know that it was a much better gift than the \"adorable\" pink bunny pajamas.SL\n",
      "The movie was funny and Christmasey.  A holiday treat that we will add to our list of must see Christmas movies.\n",
      "This is my absolute favorite movie of all time! I love watching it every year at Christmastime. It's great for a ton of laughs and the special edition has added laughs that I still enjoy watching again and again. This is an absolute MUST for any video collection.\n",
      "If this movie isn't currently on your \"must see\" for the holidays, you need to remedy that mistake now. It is without a doubt a Chirstmas classic for the whole family to enjoy.\n",
      "Good whosesome story filled with nostalgia and real life- like situations. A family friendly flick. Highly recommend it for Christmas viewing.\n",
      "Best Christmas classic, hands down.  Could watch it 10 times during the holiday season, so many great scenes keep me laughing\n",
      "In my opinion, if you haven't seen this movie you have been missing out because it's a classic.  Everyone that I know has seen it and LOVES IT!This year I plan to save up and purchase the leg lamp to put in my living room window!!\n",
      "A Christmas Story is a classic. We have a tradition in our house of watching this movie during Christmas, along with A Charlie Brown Christmas. There are many memorable lines and scenes in this movie (fragile - \"fra-jee-lay, it must be Italian). The acting is excellent and you can emphathize with many aspects of this family's Christmas experience.The 2-disc edition has some great behind the scenes stories and is worth owning.\n",
      "This is a Christmas must for me. And every Christmas I watch TNT's 24 hour presentation of this hilarious comedy classic. It cracks me up. The leg lamp, the \"you're going to shoot your eye out\" scenes, the  toungue getting stuck to the pole. Oh, there is so many scenes that crack  me up. Well, anyways. Everyone has seen this wonderful, touching, hilarious  Christmas film. And if you haven't...you must!\n",
      "This is THE BEST Christmas movie I have ever seen.  It definitely is a classic.  You will laugh, you will cry - laughing that is!  Truly a heart warming story!!\n",
      "Love this move it reminds me of the days I spent as a youngster. I watch this movie during the year not just at Christmas time.\n",
      "A Christmas Story is for my son - he believes it is a Classic and watches it every Christmas for 24 hours straight - he will LOVE the lamp.  Amazon is amazing - always on time and has exactly what I want - always.  Thanks.\n",
      "The product was purchased for my brother who is serving with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan.  He loves this movie and always made us watch it every Christmas Season!  He loved it and it was in perfect condition.\n",
      "Product was as described and It arrived in time for Christmas! My father loved this movie so I bought for him to enjoy anytime he wanted to watch it!\n",
      "With the christmas season coming up, what not a better movie to watch then A Christmas Story. With it's classic one liner's and moments of comical relief, all mixed in with a christmas wish for a red ryder bb gun, What better a movie to watch every holiday season. When you have TBS playing it all day on their 24 hour marathon on Christmas Eve and Christmas day, It is really hard to miss when you're flipping the channels. When the film came out, it did not do very well at the box office. Over the years it would gain more acclaim as one of the most beloved Christmas movies of all time. Now that they released a crappy sequel with Home Alone's Marv as the old man, I feel sad that Hollywood had to take the glory of the original and nibble some of it away as they do with a lot of classic Christmas film's these days. Example: Home Alone 3+4. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch the original because really there is no other Christmas film That holds the bar higher than this one. Except maybe It's a Wonderful life directed by Frank Capra. I have not seen it but have heard great reviews. Well, hope you guys are doing just fine and great. Happy Holidays.P.S.: Buy this movie, You'll thank me later.\n",
      "I will enjoy this for a long time anytime. The product was good and it arrived on time with the due date\n",
      "This is the best Christmas movie ever and it is great to have to play when I and my family want!\n",
      "Ah, A Christmas Story. A holiday classic that me and my parents watch every Christmas day, sort of a tradition for us. Even if you don't celebrate Christmas, you could love this film because it's hilarious and is a good example of how every kid/young teen is around the holidays: Anxious about whether or not they'll get everything they want, constantly pushing their parents to get that one gift they really want, finding ways to push them by putting little clues in their magazines, books, etc. And other than that, it's just a humorously crafted movie.The movie is about a boy named Ralphie who has longed for a Red Rider Air Rifle, but his parents won't give it to him and instead screw him over with the \"you'll shoot your eye out.\" Along with finally beating up the neighborhood bully and finding out little Orphan Annie's \"secret message\" is, his dad buys it for him in the end and hides it under the tree. Of course, it doesn't stop there. We see the Bumpus dogs wreck their kitchen and eat the Christmas dinner turkey (which Ralphie's dad has a great fetish for), so they go to a Chinese restaurant where the waiters all mispronounce that words of Deck The Halls with \"Fa, ra, ra, ra, ra!\"So if you're looking for a great Christmas movie that represents a kid's life around the holidays, yet you also want it to make you laugh so hard you pop a blood vessel, watch a Christmas movie.P.S. Merry Christmas, or, to be politically correct according to the rules of our uptight government, Happy Holidays.\n",
      "If you haven't seen it there's something wrong with you. This movie is so mind blowingly awesome that we find ourselves quoting it year round.\n",
      "You just haven't lived til you've seen the pink bunny pajamas in blu ray! As many times as I've watched this movie, I still laughed aloud!\n",
      "This is a classic movie for Christmas the whole family can share and love. Even the animals (furry children in your family). I just love it and so do my children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and all other little ones that come my way.\n",
      "A fun and entertaining family movie that is sure to please all.  Something that you must watch every Christmas season.\n",
      "I was excited to find you had the merchandise and then to get it by Christmas Eve, was great!  We had it to give as a gift on Christmas morning, just as we had planned.\n",
      "This is by far our favorite Christmas movie ever. Realized we didn't have a copy and Amazon came to the rescue! Thanks, and Happy Holidays!\n",
      "My husband LOVES this movie and watches it nearly non-stop throughout the holidays.Now he can watch it whenever he wants throughout the whole year.\n",
      "Classic.  This is a Christmas tradition at our house.  I have seen it 15 times and still laugh.  I triple dog dare you to watch it\n",
      "I loved watching this as a kid and still love it. My kids loved it too. This movie uses great imagination, it's funny and whitty.\n",
      "WE love this movie, my 5 year old boy and the rest us adults too - each time Xmas season comes around!\n",
      "I usually watch this movie on TV on Christmas day, but that option wasn't available to me this year, so I rented it and it was as good as ever. By far, my favorite Christmas movie.\n",
      "I grew up in Cleveland and was working downtown when this was filming.  Very nostalgic, and my family loves it.\n",
      "A Christmas Story- It's one of the funniest Christmas movies I've seen! Time does not diminish this great story and watching it has become a holiday tradition.\n",
      "This movie is so hilarious and it arrived in perfect condition on time for the holidays so the family could watch it together.\n",
      "It's a family favorite!  I am sharing it as a gift with another family that has never seen this wonderful holiday movie!!\n",
      "IT WOULD'T BE CHRISTMAS WITHOUT THIS MOVIE.HAVING BEEN THAT AGE AND LIVED AT THE SAME TIME IT ALWAYS BRINGS BACK MEMORIES.\n",
      "What's to say, this movie has become a tradition at our house.  I once owned it on VHS but since I no longer have a VCR had to buy it again on streaming.  I should have it memorized by now.\n",
      "The Christmas holidays is not complete without the entertainment of \"A Christmas Story\" ... A simpler time in life! A fun little movie!\n",
      "You have to understand that I am an \"oldie\". Althought the Movie is set in the late 30's or 40's (by the cars in use), it rings true for a kid that grew up in the 40's and 50's. So, for me it is a nostalgic experience. I attended a school just like the one 9 year old Ralphie attends, walking through snow to get there. There is a strong thread of truth that goes through all aspects of the movie and the characterization of Ralphie's parents, both tough and very loving, is especially enchanting. For laughs, love and a particular Christmas spirit this movie cannot be beat.\n",
      "This is a classic Christmas story movie. Fun for us to watch over and over again. Bought this to keep in our classic movie sections on our shelves.\n",
      "I bought this for my wife, who loves this movie. She loved the cookie cutters and apron. The movie was just icing on the cake.\n",
      "The kids loved it! Blah blah blah blah and blah I have nothing else to say other then it was good\n",
      "A vivid portrayal of the thoughts & dreams of a young boy at Christmas growing up in the backdrop of classic Americana.  I could SO relate...\n",
      "For me this is right up there with Its a Wonderful Life for Christmas viewing.  I watched it for years before I learned about the writer/narrator Jean Shepherd, who was a remarkable talk radio host in the 50's-70's and spun stories about his youth and daily observations on life and distilled a lot of that into this masterpiece.  This movie is just as rich and charming, great family viewing and like a great cartoon, plenty of subtlety for the grown ups to laugh over.\n",
      "I have read Roger Ebert's film reviews for decades and have found that my preferences follow his closely.  If Roger gives it a high rating I usually do too.  This is true for most films on his Great Movies list.  I watched \"A Christmas Story\" for the first time this week and really enjoyed it.  Being a child of the early 50's I can relate to Ralphie, in fact, he could easily have been one of my pals . . . I take it from his review that Roger felt the same way.  I will be watching it again--it's nostalgic and funny.  I don't know if the current generation of young people will \"get it\" when watching the movie but as a window on the 50's it speaks volumes.  In this regard it is like the movie Sandlot.\n",
      "In my house, I'm the \"Christmas movie nut.\" Because this is usually part of a \"marathon\" at some time, I'd never ordered it. Finally broke down and did so I could watch it on a varying schedule. Item came quickly, good quality picture, totally pleased with the purchase.\n",
      "First time I watched this film, years ago, I didn't like it.  I thought it appeared trite and too simple.  Over the years I have seen it a number of times and the film has clearly grown on me.  It shows the personal reflections of a young boy dealing with the mundane things young boys face.  Some of the scenes show just how ridiculous events and people (both young and old) can be.  The film has sparked a cult following that has grown to proportions that the famous leg lamp is now manufactured and available for anyone who has the desire (?) for such a thing.  This film is now rightly one of the Christmas classics.\n",
      "I remember when I was a kid how much I loved this movie. I remember laughing till my stomach hurt. Watching this movie brought back some very happy memories from my childhood!!!\n",
      "This movie is a must have for your Christmas collection. Talk about classic. Brew up a cup of hot cocoa and enjoy the show!\n",
      "We own this on Blu-Ray! Great holiday classic! My parents haven't seen it before. I bought the VHS for them to enjoy this holiday season!\n",
      "My wife and I love this movie.We already own it and bought it for a friend that has never seen it. The dad remindes me of my own father.Infact we have the same last name.I even bought my wife the leg lamp.\n",
      "This movie probably appeals to the baby boomers more than anything, but it's a great movie for the holiday time of the year.  It's kind of \"campy\" and a bit slow-moving but the actors really make the characters in the film.  It definitely was a simpler time, things weren't as complicated and it's nice to have that gentle reminder.  See this with your family, it's a delight!\n",
      "I love Rudolph, I love the Grinch, but nothing makes me feel more like a kid than A Christmas Story.  From the big snow suit on the little brother, to the kid sticking his tongue on the pole, this is it.  I saw it for the  first time in the theatre when it first came out and from then I was  hooked.  Watch it with a bunch of people and remember.  But careful, you  might \"put your eye out\"!\n",
      "We watch this movie several times each season and we love it.  I got my son a BB gun for Christmas and the first time I shot it, the BB bounced straight back and hit the post about 3 inches from my eye.  True story.  We proudly display our leg lamp in the front window every Christmas. The movie, the lamp and a few uttered \"stinklefifers\" are a Christmas tradition with my family. If you haven't seen this classic comedy, do yourself a favor: buy the DVD, make some popcorn and gather the family for a treat.\n",
      "A Christmas Story [Blu-ray]Anyone who waited anxiously behind their davenport for just a glance; for anyone who believed in the magic of this mystery man;for anyone who had that special one of a kind gift that no one and I mean no one would get for you - this leads us into the magical world of MGM's A Christmas Story.Ralphie in his lust for a Red Ryder BB Gun - \"You'll shot your eye out\" parent/adult response and the length our Ralphie goes to achieve his conquest is worth the nearly 2 hours of video viewing.A very strong cast keeps this fast paced action comedy adventure true to the written word.Admit it, we all recognize and know our own Ralphie and gang. Parents who are loving; Teachers who are so focused that they miss the BIG PICTURE here. And last how could any review fail to mention Raplhie's imaginary world which springs to life with just the right amount a suggestion.A all time holiday classic worth the watch. So good a feature one station plays the film non-stop for 24 hours over the Christmas holiday and in my house, we have it on every set until the marathon is over. Watch for glimpses of such 1939 stories as The Wizard of Oz and Mickey Mouse.if anything - just watch it once - you will ENJOY the story then buy the book of Shephards works and radio broadcast. Thank you!\n",
      "[[ASIN:0767916220 A Christmas Story: The Book That Inspired the Hilarious Classic FilmThis is a MUST HAVE CHRISTMAS CLASSIC!  A boy and his wish for a Daisy Brand Red-Ryder BB rifle. And every thing he must endure to achieve his ultimate Christmas gift along with all of his females Christmas traditions. You can't but laugh your head off as you fallow along as Little Ralphie counts down until that big morning to see if his beloved  Red-Ryder BB rifle is under the Christmas tree. This is one move I can highly recommend for a good laugh and a good time. So break out the popcorn popper make a hot toddy sit back, Turn off the cell phone and enjoy.\n",
      "Love to watch this movie always.  They just don't make 'em like that anymore.  Wonderful movie for the entire family.\n",
      "This is a Christmas tradition at my house, my kids & I watch this Movie on Tv every year but I'm so Happy to finally own the DVD. It's definitely a Must see & a Must have for All Ages.\n",
      "Always a fun movie! Must see every year during the Christmas holiday season. So many memories come to mind. FA RA RA RA RA ...\n",
      "So many people have written about A Christmas Story that it's difficult to come up with anything novel to say. I remember seeing it for the first time when I was in junior high school and the other kids were saying \"You'll shoot your eye out.\" Over the years, I've watched it as my life has changed. But A Christmas Story has always retained its charm.I think that A Christmas Story is not so much about Christmas as it usually works out for most of us. Like most \"holiday classics,\" it's about the Christmas that we always hope that we will have. For those who first watched the film in the 1980s, it evoked nostalgia for a seemingly-simpler time. A Christmas Story celebrates family, friendship, decency, triumph over adversity, and not taking oneself too seriously. It probably goes without saying that this is a \"sweet\" movie.The only things that I dislike about this film are the sequences in which Ralphie fantasizes. Those segments just don't do much for me.This film has become a holiday classic. I recommend it to anyone who has not seen it.\n",
      "This classic Christmas story will bring out the little kid in you.  The childhood memories will flood back and you will not be able to control your giddy anticipation of what Christmas might bring this year.  Relive the wonder and naivete of being a child.  I double- no, I triple-dog dare you!\n",
      "We have been watching this movie on Thanksgiving night every year since I can remember. It is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen. Very funny, sweet and great for the entire family. We even watch it all night and day Christmas Eve and Day on TNT, Totally worth the money!!!!!\n",
      "This is the best Christmas movie ever (imho).  If you're a man, you've almost surely experienced the \"You'll shoot your eye out.\"ordeal over a BB gun.  If so, you need to see this.\n",
      "You can have It's A Wonderful Life.  Even the 1938 Reginald Owen A Christmas Carol doesn't beat it (and that's the best one).  I have a full size leg lamp that is in my window the day after Halloween and through New Years, every year.  If you don't like this movie, you're clearly a godless communist, or minimally one of those freedom hating French.\n",
      "We have four Christmas movies we watch by tradition every year--\"A Christmas Story,\" \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" \"A Christmas Carol\" (George C. Scott version), and \"The Nativity Story.\"  They're all favorites but this one is the most fun.  Ralphie's story never gets old.\n",
      "It is a classic!! It is a great movie for anyone from 4 to 104  or more to enjoy every season.\n",
      "I really enjoy this movie and sometimes during our Thanksgiving and Christmas rush I somehow miss the showing of the \"CHRISTMAS STORY\" on TV.  So while I was ordering DVD's for my grandchildren to watch on Thanksgiving day.  I always send DVD's as a surprise, so Mom can do some cooking and Dad can watch his football games.  This makes less stress on everyone.\n",
      "Great family movie.  Our children watched it and loved every minute of it. This is one of the gifts we give to our friends for Christmas!\n",
      "We decided to give the axe to cable this year.  But, what would Christmas be without watching \"A Christmas Story\" at least once sometime over the holiday week?  So I bought this blu ray for my husband, he was extremely excited to still have this classic movie to watch around Christmas time.  I know that we will watch it at least once a year :)\n",
      "This movie is a classic, but we just watched it. The boy who plays the main character is delightful, as is the rest of the cast.\n",
      "I've owned this on VHS, DVD, and now on Blu-ray because of the low price. Its one of those movies that we watch every year, even though TBS does a marathon of it near Christmas. Honestly, I can't tell much difference from the Blu-Ray to the DVD. Both are a lot better than the VHS version. For under $10, its a no brainer to get this though.\n",
      "Glad to finally replace the DVD version I had that never looked better then my original VHS! I have yet to watch it, its not close enough to Christmas yet!\n",
      "We were tired of waiting to see \"A Christmas Story\" on T.V. so we ordered it from amazon.com. we were very pleased with the price. However we were even more impressed with delivery time. We watched it over and over as our family tradition suggests. It was the perfect gift for a Christmas Story fan!\n",
      "I cannot believe that people actually said that this movie was terrible. But then again, I read those reviews and they said that the main character, Ralphie, was a whiney little brat and that the father was evil and blah blah. These people are reading way too much into this wonderful movie. I pity the people who have a joyous Christmas where everything goes perfectly and they all sing carols and drink eggnog. I mean, wheres the fun in that? This movie embodies almost every family in one way or so and I always look forward to the 24 hours marathon of it on Christmas day. I will show this movie to my future children and hope they show it to their children and so on and so forth. Heck, I don't even wait 'till Christmas to watch it! It's a year 'round favorite. For all of you who think this movies horrible, please do the world a favor and step off your high horse of your panties being all in a bunch and lighten up!\n",
      "Even though it runs 24 hours straight every Christmas, I felt the need to own this. For me, A Christmas Story, Scrooged, National Lampoons Christmas, and a Christmas Carol are my top go-to Christmas movies.\n",
      "i love this move. the boys imagination is just wonderful. also the lamp is so ugly I am glad the wife broke it.\n",
      "Whether you are young or old, this story will make you laugh out loud. The characters are exceptionally well played. Guaranteed to infuse you with the joy of the season.\n",
      "till moms drops it while dusting was that on purpose was she really jelous and how did they unstick that boys tounge from the flag pole? every year and then some wouldnt be christmas withcout watching it at least once lol\n",
      "I purchased this as a Christmas gift for a friend several years ago.  As far as I know, he liked it.\n",
      "I didn't like it at all when my kids were little because of the lying to parents, profanity and the way the parents talk to their kids, but now that my kids are older, we LOVE this movie because it is sweet, touching, and hilarious!\n",
      "This movie is one of the all time great ones. Thanks so much for offering it for sale. I have already watched it several times.\n",
      "My favorite Christmas movie!!!!  All young at heart will appreciate and relate.  But...be careful...\"You'll shoot your eye out.\" Merry Christmas!\n",
      "My family and I always enjoy watching this movie. It brings back a lot of childhood memories.Good movie!Would recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it!\n",
      "I grew up in the 40's.  this is just flat out  funny and warm and lovely.  Should be required Christmas viewing..\n",
      "Myself and my family rate this 5 stars because it is hilarious, family oriented holiday film with a lovely message delivered before you even know it!\n",
      "A Classic Gene Shepherd Story done beautifully!  Great for kids and adults.  The small fry's eye view of the threatening world of a jolly Christmas, topped by wonderful performances by Darren McGavin and Mia Dillon and of course the kid himself.  And no one can narrate like Gene Shepherd.\n",
      "A Christmas Story continues to be the highlight of Christmas Season viewing.  Even though it is set sometime ago, it continues to deliver a timeless message about childhood and parenting.\n",
      "WE Love this movie. Our Family watches it every year at least once.  Every boy can remember wanting a BB gun.\n",
      "Tough to beat this film for Christmas enjoyment.  Narration by one of the best.  Now I can enjoy it in greater detail than ever before.  Quality is very good and it does beat a dvd player that upscales but like most older movies, not made in blu-ray format it lacks a little of what you get when filmed in high def to begin with.  Still one of the most enjoyable seasonal movies of all time and it just got better.\n",
      "This is his favorite Christmas movie and I wanted him to have it for always.  We will watch it tonite and enjoy it together.\n",
      "One of our favorite  Christmas movies to watch during the Christmas season! Now I have it on my Kindle to watch when ever I want.\n",
      "This is another movie they did a good job on in regards to quality.  The price was good, and I received the product within the time specified.  Would highly recommend this one.\n",
      "Well pleased with speed of sending and receiving this item.  Was in condition described.  Am very pleased.\n",
      "This is the quintessential Christmas movie. Even though it is set in the 40s (I believe), it reminds me of my childhood Christmases almost exactly. THere are some traditions that stand the test of time, and watching this movie every single Christmas season is one of them. Even ELF, one of my other favorite Christmas films, did not get played this year, but A CHRISTMAS STORY got played all day long in the background while doing our holiday, family stuff. A MUST HAVE.\n",
      "What can I say?  I just love this movie.  It is far and away my favorite holiday film.  Of course, I was a fan of Ralphie, Flick, Schwartz and the gang long before the film was released; as a teenager, I happened upon the writings of Jean Shepherd and have been hooked ever since.I've owned this movie in VHS format, the older DVD, now this wide-screen adaptation.  I'm certain if/when it comes out in HD-DVD or Blu-Ray, I'll probably get that too.  It's simply a slice of nostalgic Americana that I can watch over and over.Too much has been made over the latter-year antics of some of the child actors as they became adults.  Tragically, many make poor decisions in life and have to live with the repercussions.  This shouldn't detract from this movie's charm.  The kids are, in a sense, locked in time and forever young in this movie, and that's how I prefer to view them.The commentary reel had some great behind the scenes tidbits, and it was great hearing this group of talented people reminisce on scene after scene as it played out.  I would have loved to have seen some actual outtakes and deleted scenes, and perhaps in a future incarnation of this movie, they'll dig into the archives and include these.  I'd also like to see them do a true re-master of the film and restore the quality and vibrancy to the scenes. This is something of a national treasure, and it deserves to be preserved for generations to come.Bottom line: if you enjoy Christmas nostalgia, the humor of the late Jean Shepherd, or just want to be a kid again for a couple of hours, you just can't beat this film.  Whether it's December or July, it's a cool bit of entertainment for the whole family.  Now where's my Ovaltine and trusty Red Ryder carbine action BB gun...\n",
      "This one is a winner and you \"won't shoot your eye out!\" Love it. A Christmas classic that we watch with the Grinch and A Christmas Carol,(B&W and color versions).\n",
      "I love this movie.  It's a staple in our Christmas traditions.  Wouldn't \"feel like\" Christmas without it.\"You'll shoot your eye out!\"\n",
      "Great movie for the whole family!! I wish things could go back to the time of A Christmas Story!!  Loved it!\n",
      "Always brings a smile and laugh to our family. The memories of Christmases past come flooding back with each viewing. If not already, it's sure to be a favorite of yours too!\n",
      "By far our family's favorite holiday movie!  Ralphie has always been the lead, but in recent year's we've come to love little Randy too...keeps us in stitches.\n",
      "Marathon runs all day long on Christmas.Now we can watch it anytime!Great classic, love itwas the perfect gift\n",
      "I had not seen this movie, and I was told I just had o see it.  Yup!  Worth the time and money.  Another Christmas must have.\n",
      "As old a movie the Christmas Story may be, it will continue to have its twenty-four hour special every Christmas Eve because it's such a great movie. Not only is it hilarious, but it's also a great movie for the whole family to relax, lay around a warm fire, make some popcorn and all watch together. If you're looking for a funny, real-life, all together classic movie, The Christmas Story is the way to go.A Christmas Story was a hit when it first came out in 1983. Melinda Dillion, Darren McGavin, Peter Billingsley, and Ian Petrella are the four main characters in the movie. Peter, being Ralphie Parker, was the main one that the movie was basically all about. Ian was his little brother, Randy Parker, who followed him around all the time, and the other two were his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Parker. All the characters in the movie, evenif they weren't one of the four that I mentioned all added a little something to the flick.\"You'll shoot your eye out!\" That's all anyone ever said to poor Ralphie when he told them he wanted a Red Rider BB gun for Christmas. He didn't want a football. He didn't want a G.I. Joe. He didn't want that stupid, pink bunny suit he got from his aunt. All Ralphie wanted was his BB gun. The mother, being the cautious, old fashioned woman she is, wouldn't think twice about the BB gun, but the father on the other hand had a different point of view. Finally the big Christmas day arrives and the family opens up all the presents. No gun. The father asks Ralphie if he see's the hidden present that Ralphie must have missed. Could it be a football? Could it be a G.I. Joe? Could it be the gun? the Christmas dinner is a disaster, but Christmas as a whole was the best Christmas ever.The Christmas Story is a great movie to watch, even if it's not around Christmas time. It's so funny and fun to watch that there's no way anyone could possibly NOT like it. It's got great characters, an awesome theme, and a lot of humor.All in all, The Christmas Story is a must see. It's a Christmas tradition, and if you haven't seen it by now, make sure you tune your tv's to the Christmas Story on Christmas Eve all day and night long. The Christmas Story has beenone of my all time favorite movies since I was little, and it will continue to be, because no matter how long it's been around, this is a movie that will never grow old.\n",
      "The holidays are just better with a dose of \"Ralphie\" and the bunny suit!our family sits around and remembers to think before  you buy or make a gift!\n",
      "It's cute--but great, nah. It's one of those cult films that people like because it's quirky, nostalgic throwback to an earlier time. However, it's got some good laughs, and no one is running around naked in it or twerking, so it's a movie the whole family can watch.\n",
      "An engrossing and nostalgic feel-gooder which touches young and old. My 30+ year olds have been watching this for over 20 years and it is as mandatory at Christmas time as Bing Crosby's Christmas songs, Scrooged, a real Christmas tree and the family present-sharings. The story is so well crafted with the interior monologue blending seamlessly with the action in the movie. Great acting, direction, cinematography and the capturing of a time of innocence and family caring and love.\n",
      "What a great movie for the holidays! Definitely a classic! I can't imagine not watching this movie during Christmas time.\n",
      "I love this movie, it makes me remember being a kid again.It is a warm, loving Christmas movie that is enjoyed every year.I can't get bored with this movie.It is Christmas classic every home should have a copy of to enjoy for the Holiday's.\n",
      "Great gift - a classic! Shipped quickly and was just as described. Recommend to anyone who loved this christmas classic!\n",
      "A great family movie. Reaffirming family, traditions and the importance of helping others!! Once again, showing we can have a different opinion, yet as family we can unite to do something for someone else!\n",
      "\"A Christmas Story\" was originally released to theatres during the Holidays of 1983, and the film was met with only modest success. Not a critical hit either upon its release, the movie has now become the most touching and heartfelt Christmas motion picture of all-time thanks to numerous showings on cable stations such as TBS, TNT, and pay channels like HBO. At one time the movie was so popular the film was actually shown in a continuous 24 hour marathon. Given a modest budget, \"A Christmas Story\" tells the simple story of a young boy named Ralphie who wants only one thing for Christmas: a bee bee gun. The film is set around the 1930's or 1940's and features an excellent cast of adult actors, but it's the young child stars that steals the film, most notably Peter Billingsley who plays Ralphie. What person wouldn't love Ralphie, what with his cute smile and big round glasses. The DVD has many bonus features, but it is the informative commentary that features Billingsley and director Bob Clark that is the crowning jewel. They both offer insight into the making of the film. One neat tidbit from the commentary is when Clark states that Jack Nicholson was his original choice to play the dad. Upon viewing this treasure \"A Christmas Story\" will become a part of your Holiday viewing pleasure for years to come.\n",
      "It's a old movie I grew up watching around every Christmas. Great funny  movie to watch with your family and friends.\n",
      "This is a classic everyone should see. It is part of our Christmas traditions at our house and we are pleased to have it on DVD. Remember, be careful or you'll shoot your eye out!!\n",
      "This is perhaps the best movie Christmas movie of all! It is a wonderful way for the whole family to enjoy some time together and have a good laugh! It is just one great feel good movie and it has been my Christmas Tradition for many years. I bought this DVD so my daughter can start her own tradition too!!!\n",
      "This movie is a total classic.  It never grows old or becomes obsolete...great for all ages, kids and grown-ups alike!  A MUST see at Christmas for my family or I just wouldn't feel complete!  Yesterday at work, a woman came to our party dressed in Ralphie's pink bunny pajamas!  We all laughed until we cried.  Long Live Ralphie!!!\n",
      "I love this movies. It's a classic. Good clean family fun. Brings back lots of memories to share with your kids.\n",
      "it was a awesome copy my husband loved it i got it for him for christmas and its his favorite movie\n",
      "I watch it every year..classic in every sense. I loved the father's character. He was in a sci-fi series in the seventies....\n",
      "A very good (not excellent, unfortunately) adaptation of Shep's story, he makes an appearance, starring Darin McGavin & Melinda Dillon. What's not to like! I watch it in July because I can't wait until Christrmas to see it agaIN.\n",
      "Can't go through Christmas without watching this at least 4 - 8 times.  It's the best of the holiday for a late boomer like me!\n",
      "This is hands down the best Christmas movie made! Share it with your friends, your kids, your friends kids, and anyone else you know!\n",
      "LOVE this movie. It is a yearly family tradition. This year I even purchased A Christmas Story 2. We will see how we all enjoy that one.\n",
      "Not just my favorite Christmas movie, but one of my top five favorite films. Jean Shepard is a genius story teller. I believe that Woody Allen and Garrison Keillor may have taken a few pages from his book to learn their craft. Superlative.\n",
      "This film takes me back to my own childhood. I smile through the whole thing. It has become part of our Christmas culture here in America.\n",
      "It has become a tradition for the past 30 years now.  It's just not Christmas without \"A Christmas Story\" marathon.\n",
      "This made our Christmas thank you for sending so quickly it was a last minute idea that turned out awesome!\n",
      "One of the great Christmas movies. It's focus on the Christmas experience through the eyes of a kid who covets a particular toy is timeless. Just a wonderful, quotable, family classic. If you've not seen it...buy it...you will love it.\n",
      "A Christmas Story is one of my favorite movies to watch on Christmas, I really can't see getting through Christmas without watching the Marathan that TNT shows every year, which is a good thing. It's hard to believe it's been 20 years since it's release, how fast time goes by. It's a film with with a very special meaning to it, it made me feel when I was a child excited and thrilled to wake up Christmas Morning and find my favorite Christmas present. Even though the DVD looks great, I wouldn't buy this movie, simply because of the fact that the only time I watch is during Christmas, it's one of the films I think that's better left that way, watch only one time a year, but that's not to say it's not worth your money, because it is, I'm sure of it. If you've watched this film as much as I have, you begin to appreciate it's plot and happy ending, you feel happy & emotional for Ralpy and you begin to think of yourself & your own family, and when you've watched it as many times as I have, you understand why it's a classic and why you cannot go through one Christmas without seeing it. Ya know Christmas can be the most dreadful time of the year for many people, because of the shopping, travel, and money you have to spend, but the one thing keeps it positive for me is watching \"A Christmas Story\" on Christmas Eve with the tree light blinking, the presents under the tree, just lying in the recliner all night long, eating lasagna & meatball sandwiches (that's what's cooked up every XMAS at my house), and enjoying a 24 hour marathon of my favorite christmas movie. It really don't get any better than that for me. :-)MMF\n",
      "Christmas would not be Christmas without watching this movie at least once. The cult classic for Christmas. Pink bunnies rule\n",
      "Product came in great shape and the video was crisp as expected on Blu-Ray.  The movie is one of the Great Christmas Classics from when I was kid.  I was happy to share it with my wife who somehow grew up isolated and was unable to watch it.  Even though it was probably on every major TV network growing up.  But I'm happy to Report she enjoyed it too.  I look forward to the day when my kids are old enough to enjoy it with us.\n",
      "What else can I say? We've been watching it for years! I wonder if that's really what it was like living in the 40's, though. \"You'll shoot your eye out!\"\n",
      "I remember seeing the poster for A CHRISTMAS STORY at a theatre in Phoenix in the summer of 1983 and I wondered why in the world would anybody release a Christmas movie then.  So I didn't see it.  I've heard of bad marketing moves, but I still couldn't understand that one.Years later, I kept hearing what a wonderfully funny holiday movie this was and checked it out.  Now it's a holiday tradition to see it every Christmas.  It's that good.  I admire it for capturing the 1940's look while at the same time tapping into the universal thoughts and feelings of \"Kid-dom.\"It's Christmas Eve, I've just watched it, and I laughed out loud all over again.(My only problem with the Special Edition is that I would've loved to have heard from Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon.  I adored them both in their roles.)\n",
      "This movie is a classic.  It is from the 80s with all the classic sayings.  It is also on TnT 24 - hours prior to Christmas.  I actually wrote a paper on this movie for Pscychology.\n",
      "I have to watch this movie every year it is so funny. We have made it a Family Christmas Tradition.\n",
      "Absolutely wonderful!  This film does not pale with age.  I've seen it many times and still want to see it again every Christmas.  It's as much a part of the holiday spirit as eggnog, the tree and special cookies.\n",
      "Pop in the Tape.  Pres play, and let Ralphy and Company remind you whats its like to be a kid again.\n",
      "It's a great Christmas classic that theWhole family loves. We watched it allDay Christmas Day , can't wait to watchIn again next year.\n",
      "Humor much like Better Off Dead, we like that kind of humor. Great family funny movie. Enjoyed watching it this year.\n",
      "This is a true \"period\" movie.  Everything from the settings to characters is perfect.  There is a touch of sentimentality at the end, and it is tastefully done.  The family is stereotypical in many ways, and this makes them much more \"normal.\"  A true ensemble cast, they all contribute significantly.  The movie is sheer fun, and it is tradition in our hosuehold to watch it before Christmas and on Christmas Eve.  As for this movie:  \"Long may it wave.\"\n",
      "This classic movie is timeless and was well done. Yes you can wait for it to run on TV or netflix. This is still a great movie and just a classic for the holidays.\n",
      "MY WIFE'S FAVORITE CHRISTMAS MOVIE. REMINDS US OF OUR YOUTH. FUNNY AND TRUE TO LIFE. WE WATCH IT EVERY CHRISTMAS SO WE BOUGHT IT.\n",
      "For years we've enjoyed this contemporary Christmas classic. It's great nostalgia for people of all ages. Until now we've been unable to find the widescreen version. This really brings you inside Ralphie's world. Highly recommended!\n",
      "No frills, just a classic movie in the new format.  Don't get your hopes up on bonus material, just go to Tremont, Ohio.\n",
      "Was very entertaining.  Probably better for those who can remember 50's and 60's era.  Not good for youngsters under 13 in my opinion.\n",
      "One of the best Christmas movies of all time. Makes you wish you were young and back there in that time\n",
      "Great little annual viewing to \"shoot my eye out.\" haha. Ralphie depicts the hopes, dreams and fantasies of most little heroes wanting to rescue their world.\n",
      "My family has watched this movie on VHS for years. For those of us who grew up in the 1940s this movie takes us back to our childhood. It's a simple story and a simple plot with outstanding characters and acting. The Blu-ray brings it further into your living room. Simply put, I love it!\n",
      "Great family movie for the holidays or anytime at all. Good clean fun that brought back childhood memories for me. I watch it every holiday season.  I must confess, I own a leg lamp!\n",
      "my whole family wanted to watch this movie during the holiday season in 2013 but we couldn't find it on Netflix but I am happy I was able to find it on Amazon's website now we can watch it year after year.\n",
      "There is a reason they play this movie all day long on Christmas! I watch it at least five times every season.\n",
      "My family has loved this one since it came out.My son who is in college took his DVD back with him so we had to rent it,Reminds me ( as I'm sure it does everyone ) of when I was a kid. Thanks for the Entertainment\n",
      "Movie never disappoints. I've watched it over and over every year, still makes me laugh. Best Christmas classic for years to come\n",
      "A Christmas story is a very entertaining classic movie.  Ralphie's escapades, along with his father's obsession with a leg lamp make this dvd most enjoyable.  I highly recommend it to all!\n",
      "I remember when this movie came out in the early eighties. Even though I did not see it in theaters, I finally saw it on cable 25 years ago. Love it, love it!!! It is one of those movies thats takes you back. There is a REASON why they play this movie EVERY CHRISTMAS. It makes you laugh out loud and leaves you with a good feeling.\n",
      "This is a Christmas classic, and my family and I watch it every year. I bought this for my Mom as one of her Christmas gifts, and she absolutely loved it - the extras that are thrown into the tin made it even better.\n",
      "Nice to sit in the comfort of home and enjoy this movie during the Holidays.  Crisp color and sound from Blu Ray makes it even more lifelike.\n",
      "A Christmas Story is a MUST see for every family during Christmas time. Whether you are a young child or an adult, I guarantee you will love this movie!The main character, Ralphie dreams of getting a Red Rider 200-shot Carbine Action Air Rifle for Christmas. His mom thinks it's an absolutley horrible idea always claiming \"he shoot his eye out.\" But his dad thinks a boy his age should own a BB gun. The main focus of the movie is what I just explained to you above, but their is much more to this charming movie. Ralphie fighting with the 2 bullies, Dad and his \"leg\" lamp, Ralphie and his hilarious pink bunny outfit he gets for Christmas made my his aunt, and many more.A Christmas Story is a MUST see for every family household there is. It is a great family movie! Highly Recommended!\n",
      "If you grew up in the 50's, you will relate to this movie.  Life was definitely different back then.\n",
      "Even 24-hours every year on tbs, it's a MUST OWN movie on blu ray. Wonderfully shot and depicts a great time era, post World War II Christmas. Other movies i'd recommend on blu ray: Love Actually, The Family Stone, Serendipity, The Holday. Christmas is coming, get in the spirit.\n",
      "My whole family loves this movie! It appeals to all ages and it was such fun to view it together. A great movie at a great price.\n",
      "We watch this every year during the holidays.  It is now so convenient to pick when we want to watch it rather than searching the chanel guides to find when and where it will aire.  It is in a great format and the color is superb. Not just a story of a boy and a bb gun, rather a unique look at where we come from and how life was \"wway back then\" with a comedic take on life from a young boys view.\n",
      "What else is there to say about this movie? Its an instant classic. We watch this movie all day every christmas!!\n",
      "This is one of my favorite Christmas movies! This is a must see film for any fan of the Christmas season!\n",
      "How many times do you watch it on Christmas? This movie certainly is a classic. I'm a sucker for flashback films told by a narrator and this is perhaps a primary example of these films. For those of you living under a rock and unfamiliar with this film, it's about a little boy named Ralphie and what he wants for Christmas. The cast is fantastic and it's hilarious without being raunchy. This is how comedies used to be and some would argue should be. No doubt this film is great, but what most people don't know is that there is actually a sequel, with the same narrator, made 11 years later. My Summer Story follows Ralphie and his family the following summer and while the cast is different, the story is equally as good. I'd suggest you check out both films and be careful not to shoot your eye out kid!\n",
      "Yeeeahhh!  fantastikerisisha!!!!  The XMas Movie that does deliciousgreetings as to what  Bowling For Columbine does for docs.  Just In --R you sooooo delicious NOT!  BOZO.  too much time on yer hands?Hey -- good thing we don't have to watch Harry Potter.  Here's an instant classic for people with taste.\n",
      "Occasionally, Hollywood makes a movie that will remain popular as long as people watch movies. A Christmas Story, along with The Wizard of Oz and several others, is one of those. I love it. My kids love it. My grand kids love it. The cast, the script and the smooth flow of the movie are as near perfect as you can get. A true 5 star, diamond studded, gold plated classic.\n",
      "This is by far one of the best videos I've ever seen.  The content is suitable for all ages and will make even a grinch smile.  I rarely laugh out loud, but this story made me laugh repeatedly.  I loved the main  character, Ralphie, but even more I loved the way the story was told  through Ralphie's thoughts.  It was pure fun.  I've watched it many times  already, and plan to watch it every Christmas.\n",
      "Great movie to relax with during the Christmas family. Loving all of the laughs that I forgot about since i watched it many years ago.\n",
      "A must have for the collection.  The blu-ray is a good transfer and the bonus features are amusing.I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves this movie!\n",
      "Maybe it's the fact that it is set in what? The late 40's?...that make it timeless...so many movies from the 80's and early 90's that we set in that current time, feel a little stale now...but this movie is just as enjoyable each time, and continues to find new audiences...timeless funny classic\n",
      "This movie in my opinion is the best family Christmas story ever made, it is a story that shows a lot of family love told in a manner that is heart warming. I highly recommend it!\n",
      "Love this movie.  An innocent little film that truly understood what it meant to be a kid during the holidays. oh, and as for the leg lamp?  I've had one ever since the movie came out and display it in the living room window every year, way better than any old Christmas tree!  as Ralphie would say...  Woooow....\n",
      "Funny story thats somehow very real although overblown melodramatic.  13 yo liked it too.  Don't know how I missed it all these years\n",
      "Truly a holiday classic. Anyone who grew up during the 1940s will resonate with the experiences of the young protagonist.\n",
      "This is another good movie for kids. It is always funny and never gets old and everyone should watch it and enjoy it.\n",
      "I waited 31 years for this one, and I'm so mad I didn't watch it sooner! I loved the cute story and the dysfunctional but lovig family. I'm adding A Christmas Story to my list of favorites for the holidays!\n",
      "A Christmas Story is the greatest movie for kids and adults alike! We watch it every year ..several times, and laugh and enjoy it every time. I'd tell anyone to watch it.\n",
      "This is a great movie that kids love. I show this as a teacher and it keeps my high school students in stitches. Timeless classic. Teaches kids things about how things were back in the day. Especially the radio program.\n",
      "I enjoyed the movie.  I'll be watching this movie for years to come.  Christmas just wouldn't be Christmas without it.  I would recommend this movie to everyone.\n",
      "I am an absolute fan of A Christmas Story and was so excited to see this set together. There was only one thing that I was disappointed about was not getting the leg lamp lights with it. I wanted all of it (the apron, cookbook, cookie cutters, dvd) including the lights. The only way to get that with this anniversary set is to buy the blu-ray version but all you get in it are the lights. I ended up buying the lights on a different web site.\n",
      "I always enjoy watching this movie.  I just introduced my wife to it on our honeymoon last week!  I can't believe she never saw it before!\n",
      "This movie is the story of a little kid who sets his eyes on one special Christmas gift: a Red Rider BB Gun. It details the days leading up to Christmas day as he tries to convince everyone else that he won't 'shoot his eye out'.It is a funny, wonderful movie. This is one of those movies you can watch over and over and over again - you'll laugh as hard the 100th time you see it as you did the 1st time. It is timeless - I remember watching it as a kid, thinking it was made in the 60s. It is good for the entire family from kids to adults. Even though it comes on TV multiple times a season, it's worth buying the DVD to watch it whenever you want. An amusing fact is that the director, Bob Clark, also is responsible for movies like 'Rhinestone' and 'Porkys'.Like another reviewer, I was disappointed a bit in the lack of special features on the DVD (I think the studios do this with all DVDs on purpose so they repackage movies as special editions every few years).\n",
      "The heading says it all.  This is easily the best Christmas movie ever made, and it is great to have it on blue ray.\n",
      "My family and I love this movie and let it play all day over and over every year on christmas day.\n",
      "Excellent DVD. Good story.  What can you say about a DVD?  Somebody please have some common sense and change the filter to allow 10 words.\n",
      "Great, clean, family fun movie. You'll laugh, you'll cry you'll have a ball watching Ralphie and his brother muddle through childhood in post-was USA. Great fun.\n",
      "Must watch this movie every xmas no matter if you've seen it a thousand times. Like the bonus cd but wish they would have done more interviews. Still a great DVD set.\n",
      "I still recall seeing Peter Billingsly on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.  His all American face and calm demeanor is hard to forget on a 10 year old.Wasn't until years later I accidentally tuned in to this movie on tv.  I recognized his face and the whole atmosphere of the movie drew me in.Two of the BEST scenes is when he finally reaches Santa and gets tongue tied. Before sliding down the exit, he crawls back up the ramp to express to Santa that he wants the Red Rider BB gun...followed by a big grin to boot!  His expression of \"Santa screwed me!\" when he replies, \"You'll shoot your eye out, kid.\" is hysterical!Then the Chinese restaurant scene of the help slowly singing, \"T'is the season to be \"ja-ree\". fa-ra-ra, ra-ra, ra-ra ra-ra\".  It had me and my mother in stitches!  And I don't laugh out loud that often.I don't care if you are Jewish... BUY THIS MOVIE.\n",
      "great old time movie...great price, best price in town, have lent this movie out to many friends and everyone is enjoying it\n",
      "A  Christmas  Story is  an entertaining,  well done,  timeless classic Christmas film.  The story telling is first rate. A must see!\n",
      "We watch this yearly...it is a classic and always entertaining.  Very funny.  Although set at a different age, it is ageless.  Recommend for every age.\n",
      "I know it is on TV every year in the states. But I have never heard of it in Japan ever. I would like to recommend  this movie to people all over the world. It contains important essence that every child must go through.\n",
      "The video does the book proud... every film library needs it!\n",
      "The DVD was delivered in a very timely manner. It arrived in good condition and plays great. no complaints here. Thanks\n",
      "When A CHRISTMAS STORY originally arrived in theatres, it was only around for about three weeks because the studios didn't feel it would make any money and felt the story didn't lend itself to a longer theatrical run. It wasn't until the movie started airing on televsion and cable that people found out how great a movie A CHRISTMAS STORY is. Since then, the movie has become a piece of our American heritage, a part of the pop culture paradigm, and (like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE) a Christmas classic.The film revolves around nine-year-old Ralphie whose only wish for Christmas is to own a genuine Red Ryder 200-shot Carbine Action BB gun. However, everyone from his mother to his teacher to Santa Claus himself tells him it's too dangerous and that \"You'll shoot your eye out, kid.\" Along the way, Ralphie and his friends and family get involved in all sorts of comic mishaps. However, in the end everything turns out alright and everyone has a merry Christmas.The movie is full of hilarious heartfelt nostalgia. Anyone who has ever been part of a family or from a rural (in mindset) town will enjoy watching this film again and again. Recommended for viewing at least once a year. And, oh, yeah; don't shoot your eye out.The DVD includes the original theatrical trailer.\n",
      "This is my and my husbands favorite Christmas movie and it's frustrating to have to wait so long for it to air on TV and commercials.  Now we can enjoy starting Thanksgiving night all through Christmas!\n",
      "Holiday classic for the entire family!  If you do not have this in your collection...Well, you just should!  Without this movie; we might all have shot our eye out...\n",
      "Regardless of how it gets played on endless repeat on Christmas day, I still can't comprehend when people tell me they hate this movie. HOW CAN ANYONE DISLIKE THIS FILM? In my opinion, A Christmas Story perfectly captures the perspective of Christmas from the average child with hilarious results. And the \"true stories\" from the screenwriter's childhood have become classic gags. The leg lamp, the evil mall Santa, getting caught saying the F word by parents, the Bumpus' dogs, and sticking your toungue to a frozen pole are such classic material that I still laugh each time I see them to this day.On the video quality front, the BluRay is just okay. It's certainly the best this film has ever looked on home video, but you won't find anything crazy-go-nuts in terms of visual quality. Luckily, the disc is cheap enough to be worth the money if you dont already have it on DVD.\n",
      "I have seen this movie over a hundred times and it never gets old. Every Christmas i watch this movie about 10 times. Everything about this movie is excellent. And whoever says its not a great movie for a hole family is, well i wont say. But i would buy this movie right away if i didnt already have my own copy.\n",
      "My spouse loves this film and so do I. The film is set during the World War II. It is about a little boy named Ralphie and is quest for the \"greatest Christmas gift of all time: the Red Ryder BB gun\" and how he goes about trying to get it for Christmas. It is funny, heartwarming and just plain Christmas. The only part I dodn't care for are Ralphi's daydreams. Hence, the four stars. Other that that, this is a great film to watch any time of year, with or without your family, especially if you need a pick me up. This is an excellent film at Christmas time and I have no hesitation recommending it. Darren McGavin is great as pop. enjoy Ralphie and his family as they celebrate Christmas with a meal of Chinese turkey.\n",
      "If not for the BB to the eye, then for the leg lamp; if not for that, then the furnace and fuse battles. Along with Its a Wonderful Life, your favorite version of A Christmas Carol, and whatever music you prefer, you need this movie.\n",
      "If you want to be part of the in-crowd at Christmastime, you have to view this movie!  It has many artifacts that connects people such as fragile, \"you'll shoot your eye out\", and the infamous leg lamp.\n",
      "How could this be wrong for anyone. I like the ease in purchasing it. Good old Christmas classic. Eveyone should have it.\n",
      "We watch this every year! A must see for old fashion fun with the family...Don't poke your eye out Kid!\n",
      "Great movie!  Reminds me of the time I got by first Red Ryder BB gun, because I went through the same things that Ralph did.  Would recommend this to any man who likes nostalgia, about his boyhood.\n",
      "I never get tired of watching this.  I wish the grandkids would like it as much as I do, but they just don't get all the scenes of growing up in the 50's and 60's.\n",
      "It's sentimental for us baby boomers but, even with repeated viewings, it is side-splitting, laugh-out-loud funny.  It manages to gently lampoon our expectations for the season while celebrating it. Best Santa scene ever.\n",
      "I first went to see this movie with my parents when I was a little guy.  Now after years and many viewings the movie still hasn't outlived its original catch phrases (\"You'll shoot your eye out, kid.\") or classic school kid situations (facing school bullies, sticking your tongue on a cold flagpole outside).I loved this version, especially since it included the commentary which added an extra layer of nostalgia which will give my father and I hours of meaningless yet fun trivia to talk about.If you are a nostalgic person or just like this movie, you need this edition of A Christmas Story!\n",
      "this is the all time best christmas movie ever made it is a christmas classic my whole family watchs this christmas movie every year now i can watch it any time i bought it on blueray.\n",
      "I have watched this movie several times, and always enjoy it.  It probably helps to have been a kid in the 50s/60s in the midwest.\n",
      "This movie is downright hilarious the whole way through. In this story, Ralphie, who is 9 years old, must convince his parents and teacher what the perfect gift for christmas is. At first, he hesitates, and when he asks, its always the same answer: \"Oh, no. you'll shoot you're eye out!\" Raphie stops at nothing to get what he wants. He would not even listen to the teacher when she gave him a C on his \"what i want for christmas\" paper and told him it's a bad idea. He didnt even listen to who he thought was the real santa.The funniest scenes in this movie are :1. when ralphie and his friends get chased by 2 bullies2. when his father gets a lamp shaped like a leg and ralphie's mother \"accidentally\" breaks it,3. when the dogs next door take the dinner turkey4. when raphie find out what the little orphan annie code was only a commercial for ovaltine5. when ralphie gets soap put in his mouth when he says the F-dash-dash-dash word(it is censored by fudge)6. when santa pushes him down the slide of doom.My whole family always said, \"it isnt Christmas without watching this movie\". If you're dying for christmas to come, why not spend time watching this on tv? You'll never miss it, it comes on all day both on christmas and christmas eve.\n",
      "To get into the holiday spirit this year, I wanted to find a VHS copy of this movie (VHS would've suited me fine), but I was a bit miffed when I couldn't find a copy at Wal-Mart.  But then my mom went shopping (at Wal-Mart) last Saturday (Nov. 29) and, to my slight surprise, came home with--\"consider this your final Christmas present\"--a copy of this Special Edition DVD.  (For a long time, as sort of a Christmas tradition, my family and I relied on our television-broadcast-VHS-taped version of the movie, with dated commercials, poor picture and all.)  Though I initially wasn't intrigued by the re-release of this movie, since \"Santa\" gave \"A Christmas Story\" to me early, I thought, Cool, with a shrug.I have a 27-inch TV (fairly cheap, no-frills Sylvania model, with its picture settings unchanged, conveying overall-acceptable visuals), which uses composite video (unfortunately, that's all the set has).  Since the DVD offers both full-frame and widescreen, I chose full-frame.  Video-wise, the new digital transfer of the movie to DVD is very good.  Audio-wise, I was disappointed that the transfer offers only Dolby Digital mono (1-channel), which played mainly through my center speaker (Yamaha NSA-C143).  There is a running audio commentary from director Bob Clark and Peter Billingsley (\"Ralphie\"), which I didn't listen to.  Also, there are multi-lingual subtitles and a French soundtrack, for viewers who like those sort of things.Overall-quality-wise, I feel that \"A Christmas Story\" recieved a decent restoration treatment for DVD.  (The next time I watch the movie, I'll switch to widescreen, the aspect ratio of 1.85:1--and I may listen to the audio commentary, though I'll probably leave the subtitles off.)After I watched the movie disc, I switched to the other DVD.  I then realized why this \"Special Edition\" wasn't priced much higher than the earlier single-DVD release (about $19 compared to $15 or so)--the \"20th Anniversary Extras\" disc isn't overly-loaded with material and what's available is somewhat silly and non-essential.  I was assuming there would be a \"making-of\" featurette with behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with all of the cast members, not just a few (including the director).  But what is included in the second disc, while it technically is bonus material, could've been better.  The longest piece \"Another Christmas Story\" is only about eighteen minutes long; and I wasn't too thrilled about the trivia games; and the \"Get A Leg Up\" making of the infamous leg lamp was pretty dumb; and although its historical documentary was interesting, I never desired to have a Red Ryder BB gun when I was a child; and there are a couple other things that may intrigue some people but didn't me.Yet, I'm glad to finally have this movie, despite the fact that I didn't plan to add \"A Christmas Story\" to my DVD collection.  But since I didn't buy this \"Special Edition\" re-release, I won't complain about it--because you shouldn't overly criticise a gift DVD for its negative attributes.  From a \"Special Edition\" dual-disc set I guess I expected more--but at least the re-release is a good-looking version of a classic holiday motion picture.All in all, for the movie itself, the new version of \"A Christmas Story\" is pretty much worth the price.  I do recommend it.\n",
      "I watch this movie and I am somewhere between 7 and 9 years old. The charm, warmth and humor of this movie is the key. I can here my parents arguing over the tree. Who cooked the best turkey. Who let the dog in the  house. Who messed with the furnace. (We had a nasty one you continually had  to go push the reset button and as a kid it was scary. As an adult I still  fear that furnace.) I wanted Hop a Long Cassidy Holster and a BB gun. I got  the holster, my cousin got the BB gun, afterall he was a boy. What can I  say I love it and rewatch it every year over and over again. \"don't  shoot your eye out\" Merry Christmas\n",
      "I could watch this every day. Just brings out the kid in me and always, repeatably funny. Too many scenes that still make me laugh out loud to mention.\n",
      "My favorite Christmas story of all time!  Highly recommended for both children and adults.  It may not be as famous as some of the other Christmas classics, but it deserves to be.\n",
      "I haven't seen this movie in a long time. It's as good as I remember.  Glad I rented it again.\n",
      "Can't say enough about this delightful Christmas story.  It brings back my childhood I spent growing up and spending Christmas in the 1950s.\n",
      "A Christmas Story is a Christmas tradition in my household.  Year after year, it never gets old.  There is something very genuine about this movie - it's about Christmas, and it's not.  Every time I am enamored with Olvatine, the triple-dog dare, you'll shoot your eye out trap, oh fudge slip of the tongue, the golden leg, and the revenge on Scott Fargus.  Thank you Ralphie for entertaining me all these years.\n",
      "I was so glad to be able to create my own A Christmas Story marathon.It allowed us to continue a family Christmas tradition.\n",
      "Are you stumped on what to take for a Christmas gift to your significant other's house?  Take this.  It's one of the best Christmas movies in existance and it's fairly G rated.  I took this to my prospective in-laws house and they watched it with my Mom.  Fun was had by all.  It's a total classic.\n",
      "This is a family tradition for Christmas time viewing.  Therefore, it was a must have in blu ray.  There is a definite upgrade in picture quality from standard to blu ray.\n",
      "My family loves this movie, and want to watch it every year. \"You'll put your eye out\" is the classic line for all times.\n",
      "\"A Christmas Story\"  neeed I say more?! Its the best Christmas movie ever! I love this movie and watch it all the time all year long! A great gift for anyone of any age!\n",
      "Funny, we laughed and it took us back in time.  Good acting.  The product was in good shape.Enjoy the good old days.\n",
      "This is probably the greatest Christmas movie ever made. I have never owned this movie myself because they play it on TV every season at least nine gagillion times. If you don't belive me then watch TNT on Christmas eve, you will see it continuosly for twenty four hours, and up until then you will see it on some station or another at least once a night. However, if you do not have cable and want some CLASSIC CHRISTMAS SH*T then this is the DVD to get. Great for everyone. The story of Ralphie, the boy who only wants an official Red Ryder BB gun, but everyone in the world is trying to cut down his dreams. Every charecter in this movie is hillarious, right down to Santa and his elves. \"You'll shoot your eye out kid. Ok, lets get him out of here..oh HOH! HOH! HO-O-O-OH!\"\n",
      "Just great acting. Brings back memories of what this country was once like. Hopefully the word Christmas won't be outlawed.\n",
      "Wonderful family film. The first time my daughter and I laugh so hard we could not stop. It reminds me of my younger days, because I was a child around that period of time. So it brought back fond memories.\n",
      "You are wrong about the profanity.  The only real single swear word comes after Ralphie decyphers the secret message from the radio.  All the \"cursing\" done by the dad is gibberish meant to represent  profanity, but it's not real.  That's why it's funny.  And then there's the  tire-changing incident, which is a humorous send-up of profanity in the  home.  Lighten up, folks.  This movie rocks.\n",
      "My favorite Christmas movie of all time. You'll shoot your eye out with that 200 shot red rider bob gun. Lol\n",
      "very few.... 'forever' favorites have i......watch this movie......fall in love.....scott farkus.......'daddy's gonna kill ralphy'....'a crummy commercial...son of a b#*@#!'  :  )\n",
      "I absolutely love this movie!!! It is one of my favorite Christmas movies! A true Christmas classic for the entire family.\n",
      "Was a  grate xmas move every kid should watch it's how Xmas use to be the part we all lost In our bussey lives we seem to live\n",
      "This movie is a blast from the past for those of us who grew up during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Great story, super casting, and a true heartwarmer.\n",
      "This movie is a true classic.  The characters are eternally memorable from the dazed lead character Ralphie to the bully Farkus, from smart a$$ed friend Flick to the witchy school marm (can you imagine giving an a homework assignment during Christmas season?), and of course anyone who has raised kids can appreciate the bedraggled parents of Ralphie and his kid brother Randy who desperately attempt to survive the holiday season.There are classic memorable scenes as well, including dinner in a Chinese restaurant with waiters attempting to sing Christmas carols in broken English.  I can no longer hear \"ho ho ho!\" without hearing in my head the way that the Santa in A Christmas Story says it.This movie is a must-see in my house every year.  Christmas is not official until it's been on the TV.\n",
      "This movie is a Classic. It reminnds me of the good ol days whe. my brothers and I wished for The Redyder BB gun. I love this movie.\n",
      "too many references here to be made amongst friends and relations for this not to be watched, repeatedly.  Get it already, so you can watch it other than on Christmas eve/day on TNT with commercial interruptions\n",
      "A timeless classic that can be enjoyed each and every christmas. I'm glad to see that this film has finally made it to Blu-ray.\n",
      "So cool to see my childhood on video every Christmas.  the BB gun, the Bully, the home appliance problems, the little brother.  My cousin tried his tongue on the freezing cold mteal  pole. You know the end of that.\n",
      "We have watched this dozens of times - and we'll watch it a dozen times more.  So for it has ended the same each time, but you never know !  ;)\n",
      "This video is a classic. It should be in everyone's library. \"You'll shoot your eye out\" and getting tongue stuck to pole are great.\n",
      "Now on blu-ray in its original 16x9 aspect ratio which was never released originally (sides had to be cropped off for obvious reasons). It still retains the film grain which is a plus and to be expected. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Funny, brings back old memories that I suspect we all have to a degree.  Here's my six words that the review requires\n",
      "I have this movie on DVD and love it,so i bought it on blu-ray which only makes it more of an all time classic!\n",
      "There are so many christmas movies out there but this one tops them all. This is a great movie to watch on christmas eve with you friends and family. In this movie and young boy named Ralphe trys to convince his parents, teacher and even Santa that he needs a Red Rider BB Gun for Christmas. This movie is hillarious but still has that heart warming Christmas Spirit.\n",
      "This is one of my must own Christmas films. Your taken back in time to small town Americana and simple times at Christmas.\n",
      "This movie is right up there with  such classics as 'It's a Wonderful life'.  It is very relatable and can be safely enjpyed by the entire family.\n",
      "It's a Christmas story and a good one at that.  If you can relate to wanting something for Christmas then you can relate to this movie.  A humorous insight to how kids feel about Christmas.  Recommended.\n",
      "I had to have this in my collection. The Dvd was in good shape no scratches , shows well and I'm pleased with my purchase. Thank You\n",
      "Only had on VHS before. Now I can really enjoy it on DVD! This was a good purchase on Amazon.com.\n",
      "The film looked great on our Blu-ray player, & I was glad to see that special features are included.  Wal-Mart was selling the pan-&-scan DVD for $10, the same price I paid for this.\n",
      "Jean Shepherd's classic A Christmas Story was not a big hit when it was released to theatres in 1983 (in fact, I don't remember any advertisement of it that Christmas).  However, thanks to Jean Shepherd's narration and story telling and Peter Billingsley's performance of the shy and scheming Ralphie, who wants a Red Ryder BB gun more than anything else in the world, it's become a cult classic (shown ad nauseum on a certain Cable TV station).  When my father 1st saw it on video, he was amazed at how much the father (sometimes grumpy, sometimes flamboyant, but always respected- or else) reminded him of himself (what real life father couldn't relate to a man whose obscenities flew over Lake Erie for years?).  The mother is a lot like my own, except for the \"Pretend you're a piggie and this is your trough!\" scene which my mother certainly wouldn't have tolerated!  Ralphie, of course, reminds me of myself.  Although I never asked for a Red Ryder, there were plenty of other presents Santa had to bring or it just wasn't Christmas!  Scut Farkus is pretty real, too, as the menacing bully, as well as the no-nonsense teacher (\"Those of you who put Flick up to this know who you are and I'm sure you feel terrible!\") and the Bumpus neighbors' annoying dogs (one gets their tail caught in the door but they get their revenge!).  Ralphie's kid brother is realistically whiney: \"I can't move!\"  Then there's Ralphie's buddies, the conniving Schwartz and the hapless Flick, whose double dog dare acceptance gets him in big trouble!  The fantasy sequences are quite amusing!  Which brings me back to the BB gun- Ralphie makes his request known to his mother and his teacher (\"You'll shoot your eye out!\") and finally hopes Santa can bail him out, despite an attitude bigger than his belly and 2 ornery elves helping not so jolly Santa at Higbee's department store!As for the extras, there's a commentary on the movie with the producer and Peter Billingsley (5 stars, you learn that Jean Shepherd has a cameo in the movie).  There's an advertisement for the Red Ryder BB Gun (3 stars).  There's a corny advertisement for the leg lamp (1 star, see it only once if you must).  There's a Where Are They Now? sequence featuring Schwartz, Scut Farkus, Flick and Ralphie (5 stars, the childhood actors still look like they did as kids; since Jean Shepherd and Ralphie's father passed away, they're not featured).  Also, there are 2 short stories as read by Jean Shepherd (4 stars, if you can sit through them, but don't hit the buttons on your remote control while the story is being read or you'll go right back to the beginning of the story).\n",
      "I'm not a slave to the cable companies so I don't get the 24 hours on Christmas day so its a no brainer purchase! You'll shoot your eye out!\n",
      "I've been a fan of this movie for years.  It reminds me of my childhood back in the forties and early fifties.  The HD version is sharp and clear.  This is a fun movie for the whole family.\n",
      "For those of us who grew up in the forties and fifties Christmas Story is a wonderful opportunity to travel back to the tinsel-ridden, overloaded-electrical-socket, turkey-roasting Christmases of our youth. Nor will anyone who ever owned a Red Rider BB gun ever forget what a wonderful, liberating tool they were, capable of protecting backyard campers throughout the deepest, darkest nights, and whiling away whatever idle hour might unexpectedly turn up. People who grew up with televisions in the corner of their living room (or worse! in their own bedroom!) will never be able to truly appreciate what the miracle of radio drama meant to us kids in the days before glowing phosphors dominated the world of entertainment. But if they're the slightest bit interested in what it was like to grow up in that ancient time, they could have no better guide to that experience in this film: the costumes, the cars, the family seated around the radio, the teetering Christmas tree, the trip downtown to the big department store, it's all here for you, the good and bad of growing up back then. An indispensable shot of Christmas memories for us oldsters, a massive dose of charm for those too young to remember, \"A Christmas Story\" has become an iconic part of the Christmas season for all ages.\n",
      "FRAGILE!!What a movie, what a family, what a story.  Since I was a kid we watched this movie every Christmas, now they have it on TV for 24 hours on Christmas. It's tradition for us to continue watching this each Christmas with my family now, we still laugh at the same scenes, we still cringe when the tongue is stuck to the frozen pole lol. If you're like me, you can relate to Ralphie and always wanting that bb gun when you were little. I don't think I will ever get tired of this movie, it's an ultimate classic that I am glad to add to my blu-ray collection.\n",
      "why do I have to pay to rent a movie at all?  my yearly membership should cover the cost of most of the movies except maybe brand new ones.\n",
      "This is a Christmas classic that I remember from when I was a kid!  The humor was hilarious then and it is still hilarious now!  Funny for ALL ages!\n",
      "Loved everything about the movie except the Santa and elves at the department store. One of the kids should have barfed all over them.\n",
      "What do I need to say? Best all-time story.  My husband and I  share this as one of our favorite movies.  We wore out the original copy we had, and ended up having to buy another one.  I watch this in the summer when the temperature is 109 degrees.  The sight of snow makes me feel cooler, and the hilarious story makes me forget how miserable hot it is.  I swear my dad was the inspiration for Ralphie's father.\n",
      "this is one of my husbands favorite movies at Christmas time ... so glad I was able to order it and have it arrive so quickly !!thank you !!!\n",
      "My daughter-in-law had never seen this so it was a perfect Christmas gift that arrived in the nick of time! Thank you!\n",
      "I have purchased this movie several times over the years and for some reason it keeps disappearing.  I will try my best to hang on to this one\n",
      "Long after my interest fell off for well-worn Holiday fare like 'How The  Grinch Stole Christmas', 'It's A Wonderful Life' and 'Miracle on 34th  Street', 'A Christmas Story' has remained my all-time genre favorite. I  love it's more down-to-earth look at the yuletide season, showing the  shortcomings as well as the virtues. And what better viewpoint to see it  from than that of a ten-year-old with high hopes?Sure it's set in the  late 40's, but it does have many elements of timelessness. Things like  taking stupid dares at recess. Facing down the overbearing schoolyard  bully. Those endless hints about what you want for XMas- just to be  somewhat discouraged by your parent's less-than-enthusiastic reaction.  Formulating a foolproof plan to get exactly what you want on that magical  day. That god-awful get-up that your distant (But apparently not distant  enough) aunt sent you that your folks make you put on so they can take  Holiday pictures. Learning the art of cussin' from your dad's mad tirades  of indignation. It's those little moments in the film and in life that most  of us recall from our childhood days in mid-December.Christmas time has  never been this brutal.. or this funny. It's the best cinematic celebration  of the yuletide season yet!'Late\n",
      "You'll Shoot Your Eye out!  This is the best Christmas movie ever made.  It comes from Jean Shepard's book, In God We Trust, All Other's Pay Cash.  Shepard is also the narrator in the book.  The story follow's Ralphy's Christmas misadventures in the attempts of getting a Red Ryder B-B gun.  This great Christmas movie must be in your collection.\n",
      "Best Christmas movie EVER!!  Sweet, nostalgic and funny, great for all ages - although today's techno-dependent kids may need some explanation about the radio.\n",
      "Great story.  Funny and heartwarming at the same time.  There are fewer and fewer Christmas movies that both kinds and adults can watch end enjoy.  This is one.\n",
      "This is a great movie...a classic. We watch it every year, between Thanksgiving and Christmas. A must-have for our DVD collection.\n",
      "We have owned the VHS version of A Christmas Story for years.  After wearing it out it was time to replace it with DVD.  Haven't had the opportunity to watch all the extras but the movie itself is a modern day classic.\"You'll shoot your eye out!\"\n",
      "There is little I can add to what everyone else has already stated. To make this review to the point this movie is a breath of fresh air. Not having seen the movie prior to a few years ago I now see what I've been missing out on. An entertaining and well produced older movie with a moral slant to it. Sure it's whimsical in places and Santa Claus is not your typical grandiose version you find in modern films. However, there is an innocence that this film has that has long been destroyed in modern christmas movies. I highly recommend every family to sit down and watch this oldie every year. You won't regret it.\n",
      "WE RECEIVED THE DVD IN GOOD TIME. WE ENJOYED THIS CLASSIC MOVIE AND IT IS BLACK & WHITE AND THE COLOR VERSION.\n",
      "I gave this product 5 stars because it is a good movie! When I inserted the colorized version into the DVD player, it aid that the disc is not formatted for this region. In the description above it says that is is formatted for this region. I don't understand. I can still watch the B/W version so all is not lost ... Just wish that I could watch the colorized version also.UPDATE: I was playing the DVD in a computer (so that I could watch it with a family members house) and it said that \"it could not play in this region\" but, I came home and put it in my TV and both the colorized version (that I was having trouble with) and the B/W version played !I'm happy!!\n",
      "Christmas is not Christmas to me without this film. Edmund Gwenn must come close to everybody's ideal of Santa Claus/Father Christmas, the kindly, good humored grandfather. The adult rules and casual opportunism  are no match for  childlike innocent warmth of the story.Kringle subsitutes at the Macy's Christmas Parade for the Company's drunken Santa and ends up being hired by Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) to play Santa in the store. All goes well for a while, even when he sents shoppers to rival stores for better bargains. Mr.Macy is quick use this as a gimmick when shoppers are so moved by a \"big company putting the spirit ahead of the commercial\" they promise to become loyal  Macy's customers.The trouble starts when Kringle begins to insist that he really IS Santa. He winds up in court before Judge Henry X. Harper (Gene Lockhart) for a hearing on his sanity. Political organiser Charlie Halloran (William Frawley:\"I Love Lucy.\") urges Harper to excuse himself from the case because he's coming up for election and the last thing he needs is a \"no-win\" controversy.The unfortunate Harper has already committed himself, but he is facile enough to put Kringle's lawyer, Fred Gailey (John Payne)in the hot seat. Gailey feels lost, but seizes on coincidence for a surprising and obvious solution!However Gailey's self-confidence, so boosted by triumph, is soon undermined by astonishing evidence of the Christmas spirit.The film was made in 1947 so some creative reading between the lines of such dialogue as, Maybe [Kringle's] only a little crazy, like some of those men in Washington,\" have some allusions to the concurrent HUAC hearings. But then I may have been influenced by a lot or reading I've done about the period.\n",
      "Received this product exactly when they said I would. The price was great for a Blu-Ray and the quality is what is expected from an older movie converted to Blu-Ray.\n",
      "I first saw this film when I was 13 years old and it instantly became one of my favorite films and is still so 20 years later.  On the surface the film seems somewhat unbelievable.  The story of a man who thinks he is Kris Kringle (aka Santa Claus)somehow convinces major department stores that they should put the interest of the consumer above their own interests and then attempts to prove in court he is the one and only Santa Claus is somewhat unbelievable.  However, the great cast, the well written story and the time this film was released, just after WWII, makes the story seem almost plausible.I really enjoy the final scene in the film in which Fred Gailey, the attorney who defended Kris Kringle, is commenting to Doris Walker on the believability of Santa Claus when he notices something in the corner that makes him reconsider the statement he is making.  This scene is so important because it shows the hypocrisy that man can have.  Here we have  man who has encouraged others to believe in Santa Claus and even defended a man who claims to be Santa Clause even though he may not believe in Santa Claus himself and now he is forced to reconsider his beliefs.I have seen the 73 and 94 remake of this film and while I did enjoy the 73 version & hated the 94 version neither are better than the original.  There is a 1956 version of the film called MEET KRIS KRINGLE that is never aired and not available for purchase that I would like to see.  I saw a clip of that film and the actor that portrays Kris Kringle seems far less believable than Edmund Gwenn.  The actress the portrays Susan seems a little older and no where near as charming as Natalie Wood.  However I would still like to see the version if for no other reason I can then say I've seen all 3 remakes of this film.I purchased the didgitally remastered VHS version of this film and found it be an excellent product.  Great picture and sound.  I really enjoyed the orginal trailer.  I wanted to purchase the DVD but found that it offered nothing different than the VHS version.  This film deserves special features. Behind the scene footage and a documentary would be nice.  Several of the actors and actresses are still alive including Maureen O'Hara that could provide commentary for this film.  So until the DVD producers add some more material to this DVD I will just use my VHS version.\n"

      "Absolutely LOVED and identified with this movie!I was \"there\" -- on many a Thanksgiving Day, on 6th Avenue watching the Macy*s parade, just a few years after this eternally delightful movie was filmed. And when I was little, everything, especially Santa, was breathtakingly real. No matter that I froze my little tail off standing on 34th Street and 6th Avenue for hours (starting at 7 am, so we could get a good view of the parade!) -- on each and every Thanksgiving Day, my heart was warmed by the floats, the merriment, and....especially, Santa.So naturally, while watching this movie, I almost felt like I could look into the crowd and see....me!!! I can really relate to this movie!!The casting was perfection! From the unbelieving shop owner and his reindeer props, to the innocent little boy on the witness stand, from the bustling crowds in the street, to the interior of the typical (for that era) NY apartment building, the cast of characters and the sets were totally realistic.And I loved the little girl played by cute little Natalie Wood -- hey back then, when I was 5 years old, I even WORE outfits just like hers!!!What's NOT to love in this movie!!???Although I never chanced on this movie until the 1970's (which left me and my \"little\" sister awestruck), I have watched it faithfully every year since then. Each time I see it, I feel like I'm watching it for the first time over and over again -- this movie still speaks volumes to me.The funniest part of the movie (to me and Sis, anyway!) is when the Macy*s executive's wife (who is totally snockered) answers the (old, heavy, cast iron, just like my grandma's) phone.And the most breathtaking part of the movie-- well...is that really Kris Kringle's cane there, over in the corner?This movie should be \"required viewing\" in every grade school.\n",
      "This classic tells the story of Santa Clause coming to NYC working at MACY's and is put in a mental hospital due to lack of belief and superstition.  It has everything from laughter to romance to supense to  leaving you with a happy feeling.  It is a great film to put you in the  holiday spirit.  This film looks better and sounds better than ever on  DVD!  This film was made before 1955 so no WIDESCREEN version will ever  show up.  This is the best way to own this old classic and any other  classic for that matter!\n",
      "The film begins with the supervisor of the parade assigning people to their posts. Isn't it always difficult with people hired for a one-day job? Then we see her daughter, raised as a  sensible, rational little adult. As compensation for her failed marriage, or a symptom of the failure? Some say you should never lie to a child, like telling them about Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, or other legends. But doing so prepares them for life: they will be lied to by rulers, advertisers, employers, friends, and relatives. Get used to it, kid!The story is that the real Kris Kringle shows up to play Santa Claus - which he does to perfection. He is \"too good to be true\". This film contrasts the legends to the realities of adult life. What would happen if everyone spoke the truth as they knew it? Is this film a warning against forcing children to grow up too soon?Susan Walker tells Santa Claus what she really wants: a home with a backyard where she can play. Isn't that what every child should have? After happily married parents? One scene shows Mr. Macy shaking hands with Mr. Gimbel; is this a comment on world conflicts? Another scene discusses the \"guilt complex\" of givingaway gifts. Does this explain the charities of Carnegie, Rockefeller, and the others?The story continues with Kris Kringle brought into court for a sanity hearing. Anybody who doesn't believe in Santa Claus, or lawyers, should see this. Yes, the scenario is rigged, just like a lot of life. Or maybe some court cases? Does public opinion affect trials like in this film? Do political bosses advisejudges in real life? How do you think judges get appointed? Kris Kringle's lawyer persists in his defense, even at the cost of his job. He will defend ordinary people against their oppressors. The political boss explains the economics of the Santa Claus legend, a fact that cannot be denied.Since the Post Office has a ton of dead letters, they decide to send them to the courtroom. His identity is thus authenticated by the US Government! The ending is drawn out, but little Susan finally gets her Christmas present. \"You have to have faith\" says her mother. And another happy ending to a Hollywood movie.The saddest fact is that Natalie Wood never lived long enough to play the mother in the remake. Real life doesn't always have a happy ending.\n",
      "Many of us have seen Miracle on 34th Street many times (once a year), and for me it never wears out.  Just seeing Edmund Gwenn convince the sceptical, but adorable Natalie Wood that he's Santa is always both moving and hilarious.  The theme is that sometimes good (Gwenn) triumphs over evil (Sawyer) with a little luck and magic (unfortunately not this year though.)The way the plot is put into place is masterful and George Seaton's direction flawless.  Maureen O'Hara and John Payne (Gailey) do a great job and if you listen carefully you can hear O'Hara's Irish accent creep in.  Also great is the judge played by Gene Lockhart who gives his role just the right dash of comedy, as well as William Frawley (better known as Fred on I Love Lucy).The swipe it takes at psychiatry is too mild though.  It depicts Sawyer as a fake psychiatrist...not challenging the legitimacy of psychiatry itself.  However the message gets subtly through...there are those in the profession \"with no humanity\" as Kris Kringle puts it.Even though you know the outcome it's still great to watch the triumphant result of Gailey's efforts, as well as Kringle's winning over of everyone at the end.To me THIS is the quintessential Christmas film, not Wonderful Life or Christmas Carol which are too sentimental and dated.  Miracle is intelligent, human, and timeless.\n",
      "This is my all time favorite movie I have watch this movie as long as I can remember.I love that it is in black and white #CLASSIC\n",
      "A wonderful Christmas story, well-written, and fun to watch. Natalie Wood plays a precocious little girl whose mother, (played by Maureen O'Hara) obviously hurt and disillusioned by life, is determined that her daughter is grounded in reality and truth - never using her imagination or pretending, and of course believing that Santa Claus is a myth. From there we have the story of Santa Claus, Macy's Department Store, a handsome lawyer neighbor, a crazy \"psychologist\", a lawsuit, and the blossoming of \"faith\". I enjoy the new version of this classic, but the old has great charm, & should be included in the list of great movies to be watched during the holidays.Addendum: Just watched the newer version with Elizabeth Perkins, & although we like this one, we are all agreed as a family: The old version is much better! Great courtroom scene, the whole mailroom scene - more clever & less \"dumbed down\", so to speak.\n",
      "I have always loved this movie, and I recommend the movie for any household.  Especially around the Xmas season. Great for Kid watching.\n",
      "a classic for all time, for all ages, this original version of Miracle on 34th Street will make even the most skeptical \"a believer!\"  Good, old-fashioned entertainment.\n",
      "This is in my opinion the best version of this story, how can you not love Santa and any Christmas story, especially when you have kids.  Just another classic I highly recommend.  It provides a wonderful visit back to a simpler, innocent time, a time when you did not have to worry about saying Merry Christmas, why can't children and adults believe in the big guy Ho Ho Ho.\n",
      "I watch this every Thanksgiving. All the actors make you believe their characters. Simple story with a simple message, Have Faith\n",
      "My sister and I grew up in New York City, and both of us remember when our mother always took us to see Santa Claus at all the different department stores in NYC, especially Macy's at Herald Square.  Miracle on 34th Street brings back happy memories of the good old days, and showed wonderful scenes of Macy's in the 40's, as well as the annual Thanksgiving Parade.  My sister and I both purchased this DVD from Amazon as a keepsake.\n",
      "This is one of my dad's all-time favorite movies, and I'm really glad you guys had it for a decent price. Thank you so much.\n",
      "I picked up the MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET 2 DVD set at a store because it was really cheap. I've only seen the remakeMiracle on 34th Streeton cable, which I liked, and so I decided to check out the original.Needless to say that I enjoyed it immensely!The story is about an old man (Edmund Gwenn won Oscar for this role) who believes he is Kris Kringle (Santa) and tries to convince a young girl (Natalie Wood) to believe in Santa Claus, too. He not only has to convince the little girl, but he also has to convince the state of New York when he's put on trial to be declared insane.At its heart, the story is really about believing and never giving up on dreams and miracles. Perhaps this is why MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET has become such an enduring holiday classic.There are two DVDs in this set:===== DVD 1 =====Colorized Movie with optional commentary by Maureen O'Hara.== The colorized version didn't bother me and wasn't strange looking at all, but for purists, the black and white version is on DVD 2.===== DVD 2 =====Black & White Original Movie and Special Features*** AMC (AMERICAN MOVIE CLASSICS) BACKSTORY-22:04-minutes== Behind the scenes special on the making of \"Miracle On 34th Street\" with actors Maureen O'Hara (\"Doris Walker\"), Robert Hyatt (\"Thomas Mara, Jr.\"), Alvin Greenman (\"Alfred\"), Lana Wood (Natalie Wood's sister) and others. Wonderful tidbits of information... did you know that the movie was released in June? And it still became a holiday favorite!*** FOX MOVIETONE NEWS--01:45-minutes== Short clip of the Academy Awards when Edmund Gwenn (who plays \"Kris Kringle\") won for best supporting actor for MO34S.*** PROMO SHORT TRAILER--05:05-minutes== Because 20th Century Fox didn't want to push this as a \"Christmas movie,\" since it was going to be released in June, the trailer shows nothing of the actual film. Very clever!*** MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET TV VERSION \"MEET KRIS KRINGLE\"--46:00-minutes== This is the television version with different actors but the plot is the same and still fun to watch.*** MACY'S THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE: FLOATING IN HISTORY FEATURETTE--15:27-minutes== This is a wonderful special that shows color home movies of the actual Macy's Thanksgiving Parade that was used in the movie and other fun stuff that adds to the movie.*** POSTER GALLERY== Posters for the movie.This DVD set is such a great deal and if you like to watch classic movies or, like me, enjoy seeing real footage of real places back in the day in movies, you should definitely buy MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET. You'll watch it year after year!\n",
      "Classic Christmas movie! I've watched this every year around Christmas since I was a child and the holiday season just wouldn't be the same without it. Love it.\n",
      "There are so many versions of this movie, but this one is without a doubt my favorite. Wouldn't own another version.\n",
      "Excellent movie for the Christmas holiday. Stars Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Natalie Wood and Edmund Gwenn. This is the role for which Edmund Gwenn won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.  Notable appearances from Gene Lockhart and William Frawley (you may remember him from the TV show \"My Three Sons\".\n",
      "We've been watching this movie since we were kids!  Love it!  Timeless!!  Edmund is great with Natalie wood and the bubblegum scene.\n",
      "One of the classic must see Christmas movies. There are several remakes but none compare to the original 1947 movie.\n",
      "Another holiday classic movie. My wife's favorite.\n",
      "I love this story and always have, so I'm biased.  I've watched this movie year round.  I believe ... I believe\n",
      "I have always loved this Christmas classic!!!  Natalie Wood is adorable and actor who plays Kris Kingle is totally believe-able.\n",
      "Acting, directing, cinematography, editing, story. All peerless.  Definitely somewhere on my top 100 list. Natalie Wood's performance is so natural it’s incredible.\n",
      "A good classic.  Love to watch every Christmas\n",
      "I watch this every year on TV and this year I bought the video. Love the story.and will continue to watch it.\n",
      "Old time classic.  As a little girl and into my adulthood, I have enjoyed watching this movie.  My children and my grandchildren have enjoyed watching it also.  It is a must see.\n",
      "This blue-ray version was wonderful, it brought me back to my childhood and the wonderful Christmas' I had.  I would recommend buying this version for sure.\n",
      "This is a classic Christmas movie that we watch every year.  It is timeless and I recommend every family have a copy of this classic.\n",
      "A very witty and timeless story about Santa Claus with a little romance thrown in.  I've watched this movie every Christmas with my kids and still love it as a grandmother!\n",
      "Family favorite, just had to get it. Not the original black and white but the colors are great.I would recommend this for a family movie.\n",
      "The story is a classic and this original is one of the best.  However, as a Blu-ray we expected a bit more.  First, the cover shows the colorized version of the movie.  We expected to get both, you only get the black and white version.  In fact, that is all you get.  Hardly worth the blu-ray disk storage.\n",
      "You can't go wrong with the original 1947 black & white and the colorized version all in one set.  Along with many special features.\n",
      "One of my favorite movies as a child, I had to get this. The up-convert quality is great and I couldn't be happier.\n",
      "Who doesn't like an original!  This movie is the best one made and much better than the later versions that were made!\n",
      "When looking for another movie to add to our Christmas Collection, this one stood out for several reasons. First, it was something from and earlier age, which I've come to appreciate more and more. Secondly, the plot was interesting enough to investigate further. So, without much ado, the movie was ordered with great anticipation. However, when it arrived and we gave it a first viewing, we were MORE THAN OVER-JOYED at the wonderful storyline and acting! This great movie classic far surpassed any of our expectations, and we watched it two nights in a row, with even more satisfaction the second viewing! This was a great purchase, a great addition to our Christmas Collection, and a very moving and touching story indeed. This movie possesses all the elements of the Christmas spirit and season, including some early scoffers as to the reality (or not) of Santa Claus, and everything viewed through the eyes of a small child (young girl). Wonderful!I promise you -- if you're thinking about purchasing this movie for your own video collection, you cannot go wrong! You will not be disappointed but rather, surprised by the ending and filled with joy as result of the outcome! Wonderful! Thank you Hollywood, for making another great Christmas classic for each generation to enjoy and experience! Treat yourself with a great holiday gift that will continue to give and give and give every Christmas season! You'll be glad you did! I promise you.\n",
      "I have to watch these two movies around Christmas time.  Otherwise, it wouldn't feel like Christmas.  Merry Christmas to Me.\n",
      "This version is the classic one.  The setting is in New York City in the late 1940s, so it might seem a bit out of date for some viewers, but that should not be the case.  The acting is excellent, and the story is very moving.  The little girl is played by a young Natalie Wood, and her mother is played by Maureen O'Hara.  The male lead (not Santa) is John Payne.  These are all excellent actors, and they give wonderful performances.  I put this film in the same category as \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" which is the Christmas classic starring Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed.  I bought it because I like to see it over and over and to share the film with family (on loan only, of course).  It is a must see for children.  As for me, I like to see the film any time of the year when I need a mood adjustment.  It never fails.\n",
      "Family time is back again when watching this movie.I really liked this version.  The other version is good also,but there is nothing like a classic version.\n",
      "she needed a VHS of the movie, i bought her one.  Paid one great price!\n",
      "They don't make them like this anymore - they should - They would be shocked at the responses. Good job.\n",
      "I purchased the remake but felt I needed the original for my library. Natalie Wood was perfect in this role.\n",
      "So many parts are so GOOD, that it's a 'classic'.  If you have other favorite 'Christmas movies', check this one out - it will joint the list in all probabiity.\n",
      "I own both the B&W; blu ray and the 2006 colorised/b&w; dvd.  I haven't yet watched the dvd versions so, won't comment on those yet..  However, I watched the blu ray last night and have to say the studio has done a wonderful job transferring this spectacular and heartwarming film to blu ray.  I didn't notice one instance of the picture feeling too 'dark', nor does this blu ray contain a single nick, scratch or 'line' on the image.  It has been cleaned and touched up beautifully for the blu ray release.  My TV has been professionally calibrated, which also helps!Sound on the blu ray is great too.  Of course for a movie of 1947 the sound is going to be very 'mono'-like but, there wasn't a hint of treble 'harshness' that you hear from so many of these old movies transferred to dvd & blu ray.  It was smooth, and vocals were clear and crisp.  Full marks on this front.I actually bought both the colorised (2006) dvd, as well as the blu ray(the blu being b&w; only) - this was because independent web reviews indicate the colorisation of this movie was actually very good!  I'm yet to watch the color version but will post a review on that as well when I see it.  Both are on amazon and both are very cheap so, I'd recommend buying both!  You can't beat this wonderful movie in colorised version (so I've been told!)  B&W; on the blu ray is beautiful for the purists but, having a color copy is great as well - I'm sure it will enhance the experience and I'll be sure to post a review of the color version when I get a chance to watch.As for the blu ray though - just beautiful!  Highly recommended.\n",
      "Charming, moving and very funny. A wonderful family movie for everyone. I have enjoyed every minute of it and so did my family. Must see during any holiday season.\n",
      "I bought this and 3 others for myself for Christmas and they will be a great tradition for our family for years to come!\n",
      "a wonderful holiday movie it can be a tradition in your family like mine  thanks so much i now have both movies\n",
      "I can't think of a better Christmas movie, this is a total classic and has never failed to get me in the Christmas spirit.I've never found out why it makes me cry, but its never failed to do that either. For me its the ending when Susan runs down the stairs and tells her mother she was right \"mommy said even when things don't turn out just right you still have to believe, and oh mommy I do believe, I do\" and at that point I know I can feel the tears starting to come in my eyes and by the end I'm done for, but this is a beauitful movie, that can make anyone believe in Santa Claus :)\n",
      "this is a great family Christmas show.  We've watched it from the time our kids were little - now they are both grown!\n",
      "There are few Christmas movies that have a wonderful story like this one!  The only one I like better is \"A Wonderful Life.\"\n",
      "Miracle on 34th. street is a lighthearted, whimsical, fun, simple movie with a happy ending!  Sheer pleasure for any kid age 5 to 95.\n",
      "Have both of them in VCR's much prefer this one so i bought the DVD....delightful\n",
      "It does a fantastic job of joining the mystical and the real in the true Spirit of Christmas. I highly recommend it!  The actors and actresses are perfect in their roles, adding humor, depth without being too sentimental.  Great for adults and children.\n",
      "We've been watching this movie as part of our holiday experience since my daughters, now adults, were small.  Great family entertainment.\n",
      "I ordered this because I'm a HUGE Christmas nut and am in the process of obtaining all of my old school favorite Christmas hits. My stepkids and I watched it just before Christmas and they loved it. A classic for all ages.\n",
      "There's no way a Blu-ray version is going to dramatically improve a 60 yr. old B&W movie.\n",
      "It is the first and best of nay made after it. I've always watched this black and white original enjoying every minute of it.\n",
      "AWESOME DIGITAL COLOR TRANSFER! A MUST BUY FOR TRADITIONAL FAMILY VIEWING!\n",
      "I liked the sense of hope and optimism, and even magic, conveyed by Edmund Gwenn that overcame the weary cynicism of the widow played by Maureen O'Hara.  The movie, made in 1947,  is a real \"upper\" for a nation tired by the stresses and sacrifices of war.\n",
      "One of my favorite movies of all time, the awesome \"Miracle on 34th Street\". I love the cast of this version also. I've seen all the other versions, but this one, to me, is the best. In my family, this movie is a tradition for us now. I look forward to watching it each year. I recommend this film to all.\n",
      "Although I enjoy the modern remake of this movie, the original (this copy) has the best ending.  No spoilers, but it's a bit different from the more modern version.  Other than that, they both follow the same simple progression through the screenplay, but all in all, this is my favorite version.\n",
      "One of our family's all-time favorites!  It's always on the short list of holiday movies we have to watch.  Fantastic!\n",
      "I am easily confused. This year I got another DVD and a Blu-Ray version. I forget which one this is. But it doesn't matter because this is my absolute favorite movie of all time. And I might buy another one. Or two. Okay, I'm obsessed. Now, leave me alone. I need to go watch this again.\n",
      "Thank's , For thegood job in sending it to me . It came in good shape and quicky . ART\n",
      "My wife and I have been married for 48 years and spend time each Christmas season watching the Christmas movies that have been a part of many years. We find that this activity keeps memories fresh and the Season meaningful.  Our children (now in their 40's) are finding the same excitement.  Thank the Lord that the films, etc., are still available.\n",
      "Wonderful, joyful tale for believers and nonbelievers both.  Skeptics, at times, do well to suspend their disbelief and enjoy the spirit of the season.\n",
      "Still a movie classic. Christmas wouldn't be the same without this magical film to warm the holidays. Re-make is really just as good, depending upon your personal taste.\n",
      "A classic for Christmas movie buffs, and movies in general. This is the original version before Ted Turner got his grubby hands on and colorized it.  Colorized version has nothing on the b&w.\n",
      "What a set of movies! I have searched for years to find the colorized version of the Original \"Miracle on 34th Street\". I couldn't find it anywhere. I love the black-and-white version, too. This great set has BOTH. I've enjoyed it throughout the season and lent it out to friends for their viewing pleasure and will do that again for years to come. Best buy I have ever made online and Amazon makes the purchase so easy anymore. The remake is a good try - but - you cannot beat this original version of this great movie.\n",
      "Although I've seen other versions of this film, this is the one I enjoy the most, probably because I enjoy the nostalgia of the classic black and white cinematography and the \"Hollywood Era\" stars. There are colorized versions of it, but because I grew up with the black and white version, I prefer the latter.A very young Natalie Wood stars as the little girl Susan who doesn't believe in Santa Claus, because her mother has decided she should grow up practical and realistic about the world.  She's so dear and so precocious you can relate to her instantly.  Her attempt to learn about the Imagi-nation by imitating a monkey is classic.Edmund Gwenn is the ultimate Khris Kringle--although I did enjoy Sebastian Cabot's version also.  He's charming and loveable in the role, and whether you believe he is who he says he is or not, you definitely like him.Maureen O'Hara is at her most beautiful in the post war fashions of the 40s and is the thoroughly modern woman of her era.  A divorced, working Mom with no illusions about the world and the people in it, she gives Santa a greater task than her daughter does, since it's not just Santa in which she has lost faith.  This film was made in 1947 only a few years after the end of World War II, and women had only just achieved a degree of \"can do\" status because of their war time participation, so the film has some pretty interesting things to say about society.  Generally speaking, divorce for any reason had been considered a bad thing and divorced women had often been socially ostracized, so this is a great departure from earlier social norms.  The fact, however, that she is being encouraged to \"believe\" in Santa and abandon her pragmatism and independance may well be part of the move to return women to the \"good old days\" where their only role was the household.  Certainly the 1950s would see a far less light handed attempt to force women back into the home and subservience and convince them that they were a little too stupid to actually deal with life outside of it--at least in film.  This was more due to a radical about face of the film industry under the very real political threats posed by conservative elements during the McCarthy era than it was to the realities of life during the period.  Like it or not, real life would never be that simplistic and certainly by the 1960s both society and the cinema saw all \"hell break loose\" from the top to the bottom of society.  For a little while at least, there was a little warmth and charm at Christmas.A wonderful Christmas classic.\n",
      "finally I found a copy of this movie in Black and White! So much better than the colorized version...\n",
      "This is one of the best Christmas movies Ever. Do not buy the remake its horrible movie. This movie is about faith in people and belief in the impossible.\n",
      "Love this movie!!!!!!  Definitely a classic.  Original is much better than remake.  It's just not Christmas without watching this movie.\n",
      "My favorite movie to watch every Christmas season.  A family tradition for both children and adults. Ages 6 and up will be enchanted.\n",
      "Great Movie!! Have loved this movie for a long time. If you are looking for a great family Christmas movie,then I would recommend this one!!\n",
      "Another Christmas movie I watch every year is Miracle on 34th Street - the one with Maureen O'Hara and little Natalie Wood.  Goodness that little girl was a great actress, even before she met and married Robert  Wagner.Miracle on 34th Street is the story of Santa Claus, the REAL  Santa Claus.  And you better believe he is real, or you might not get any  presents at Christmas.He was so convincing that his lawyer got him  declared as the real Santa Claus.Everybody from newborn to dead should  see this movie.  I know there are other versions, but this one is always at  the top of my list at Christmas.  Christmas just wouldn't be Christmas with  Miracle on 34th Street.\n",
      "Everyone needs to believe in miracles.  Dreams do come true and Santa lives in all of us.  This movie shows just how much family and love is needed in everyones life.\n",
      "This is the original an only version of Miracle on 34th Street worth watching, and in fact the only one worth watching.\n",
      "A true Christmas classic which should  be watched every year - it is very heart warming with a great message.\n",
      "THIS IS A WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS MOVIE EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY CAN ENJOY AND LOVE FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO COME\n",
      "My family and I have always watched this movie at Christmas time on tv but decided this year we wanted to see it on our own schedule.  We enjoyed this true classic with such a great message.  I recommend you too buy this movie and share it with your family and friends!\n",
      "This film came a day early. Still factory sealed. The movie itself was even better than I expected. Great quality, great price, I would recommend this seller to all.\n",
      "I've watched this movie many times and just wanted my own copy so I could enjoy it without commercials and also watch it whenever I wanted.\n",
      "i recommend this movie because when i first saw this movie i didn't believe in santa claus. i know how santa claus comes from the heart. this movie is a delight to see how the change of a mother and a daughter can come to love something that they did not believe in before. this movie gives the person watching the chance to figure out for themselves if they believe in santa claus too.\n",
      "I watch this movie every year and last Christmas I realized that I only had it on VHS and couldnt play it so I had to find it on regular tv to get my fix.  Well from now on I wont have that problem.  You just cant beat a classic.\n",
      "This movie is a family movie to be watched over and over.  Each time I see it, I see new things that I missed.\n",
      "An all time favorite that's been around for some time.  Great movie for everyone to have, for sure.  A must have!\n",
      "This Christmas movie makes one laugh and cry.  There are so many wonderful scenes, especially the one when Natalie Wood (the doubting seven year old) sees Santa (Edmund Gwenn) speaking in Dutch to the little, immigrant girl sitting on his knee in Macy's.  John Payne delivers an unforgettable performance as an up and coming lawyer who wants to get Natalie Wood's mom (Maureen O'Hara, who he likes alot) to believe their is indeed a Santa Claus.  He even defends in court Kris Kringle as the one and only Santa Claus by bringing in the US Postal Service to prove his identity!  Get the kids and grandkids together to enjoy this heart warming story of the miracle of Christmas happening not only on 34th Street, but in believers of Santa everywhere.\n",
      "When Maureen O'Hara, the top-billed star of 1947's \"Miracle on 34th Street\", proudly proclaims all three 'remakes' of the story were flops, it may sound a bit conceited...but she is absolutely right, the original IS the best...and THIS is the edition that is a MUST for your collection!Based on a story by Valentine Davies (who wondered how the real Santa Claus would react to the commercialization of Christmas), with an Oscar-winning screenplay by director George Seaton, the film is a triumph of perfect casting, perfect timing, and a sentimentality and humor that post-War America desperately needed. Contrary to general opinion, 20th Century Fox did not treat it as a 'minor' film (studio head Darryl F. Zanuck loved the story), but location shooting (at the first Macy's parade since the war began, as well as inside the store, during the Christmas 'rush') would push the budget to the limit.O'Hara (unhappily yanked from a long-awaited return to her Ireland home), and popular Fox leading man John Payne were cast in the leads, but the real 'stars' of the film are Oscar-winning 71-year-old Edmund Gwenn (who is absolutely perfect as 'Kris Kringle', and convinced everyone on the project that he really WAS Santa Claus), and 8-year-old Natalie Wood (the most gifted of the post-War child stars), who brings young Susan brilliantly to life. Their scenes together are so sweet and irresistable that the film positively glows!While elements of the story are 'dated' (the competition between Macy's and Gimbel's, the Postal information, etc.), it simply gives the 1947 version a 'timeless' quality that the 1994 version lacked...and in not attempting to incorporate 'magic' into the story (as the Attenborough production uncomfortably does), it actually seems MORE magical!Several supporting players should be singled out; Thelma Ritter (in her screen debut), is wonderful as a frazzled mom; Gene Lockhart (the judge) and William (\"I Love Lucy\") Frawley (as the judge's campaign manager) are hilarious together; and Porter Hall, as the hiss able 'psychologist', Sawyer, is a perfect foil for Gwenn. The entire cast is superb!This edition offers both a B&W; AND 'colorized' version of the film, each featuring a warm commentary by O'Hara (taped at the 86-year-old actress' home, in Ireland), two documentaries (including scenes from the Thomas Mitchell, Sebastian Cabot, and Richard Attenborough versions), the bizarre trailer for the film, the complete 1955 TV production starring Mitchell, and a sentimental history of the parade.While the film was, indeed, originally released in the summer of 1947 (to maximize profits), it is a bona fide Christmas 'Classic', and should be an essential part of your holiday collection!\n",
      "I think this is the best version of this movie. Would recommend it to anyone and everyone who loves Christmas movies.\n",
      "I will not bore you with a recap of the whole movie or state, which is obvious to all that this 1947 black and white movie is one of the major Christmas Classics.Kris Kringle (Edmond Gwenn) is appalled to find a Santa preparing to be in the Thanks Giving Day parade is intoxicated.  Kris is hired to play the part of him self.  He befriends a child Susan (Natalie Wood) who does not believe in Santa or the tooth fairy or giants.  His employer Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) is dubious of her decision to hire him after learning that he believes he is Santa.  In the spirit of Christmas he brings two rival stores together and is in the process of bringing the girl around to believing.  Naturally I left out many other controversial questions and fun scenes.  Among them is one where a Dutch girl recognizes him as Santa and he speaks Dutch to her.Through a few misunderstandings he is put on trial and must prove he is Santa.  Can his friend, who happens to be a lawyer, prove this?  If not what will happen to him?  What effect will this have on Susan?  Or you?Them! (Snap Case)~ Edmond Gwenn\n",
      "I ordered a DVD, Miracle on 34th Street, for a holiday gift. It was miraculous how fast it came! As if Santa himself popped it in my mailbox. Although there was no cane leaning against my gate...\n",
      "It is a wonderful movie for the whole family.  This is the original ... NOT the remakes ... They don't measure up.\n",
      "Living in CT growing up, I had many opportunities to see the Thanksgiving parade in NY.  Macy's was one of our favorite stores to shop and visit and of course, see Santa Clause.  My mother would make a whole day of it, take the train into Grand Central Station, eat at the auto-mat, across the street, then on to Macy's.  With me came the family, brothers and sisters.  We always had fun and this movie reminds me of when I was young and everything seem like a Miracle in NY at Christmas time.\n",
      "Had no problem streaming this and it was the perfect way to spend Christmas. This is the best one by far.\n",
      "Have watched it for YEARS on T.V.  A Christmas tradition!  Not shown as much now days, so when I had opportunity to buy it  I  jumped at chance because it is so-o-o very good!\n",
      "This is one of the BEST Christmas movies ever made and should be a MUST SEE for all families to watch together every year!  Kids today will enjoy the colorized version better than the black and white, but either version is wonderful.  The 1994 remake is one of the truest remakes ever that did not lose the true spirit and intent of the original, however, I love with watch BOTH versions every Christmas.  You cannot go wrong with this version, and Amazon.com always delivers as promised! I also really enjoying having Amazon Prime this year!  It is so worth it!\n",
      "a timeless classic ... no remake could ever be as good (including colorizing!). A winner for Christmas movie junkies of all ages!\n",
      "A fabulous movie that will warm your heart and fill you with the Christmas spirit!  Make this one a family tradition every year.\n",
      "Love to watch this movie with the family on a regular basis.  You won't be dissappointed.  It's good for all ages.\n",
      "classic they dont make chtristmas shows or movies good anymore no tradionals all commerical, grabs your heart to warm it\n",
      "A good classic movie.  Way better then any of the remakes.By the way, why is there a minimum word count?\n",
      "when you watch this it makes you believe even if you know better.....well done and a must for every Christmas...keeps the season right.\n",
      "I like this movie and watch it every Christmas. This package gives both B&W and Color options as well as additional and historical information about the movie and making of the move.\n",
      "Excellent quality film.  The DVD contains both the original black and white version as well as a colorized version.  Highly recommended for every family, we love it.\n",
      "This is one of the greaties all time movie ever made I can watch it over year after year . . . . . . . . . . .\n",
      "We all know the story but it's great to revisit it every now and then. It is worth your time.\n",
      "This is a wonderful classic story that will warm your heart and warm your soul. It is a heart warming Christmas story you will watch again, and again!\n",
      "It wouldn't be Christmas with our Miracle on 34th Street.  I watch it on Thanksgiving Day each year.  Maureen O'Hara is just delightful as Susan.  Maureen O'Hara is also so good in this.  You must get it and watch it each year.\n",
      "I enjoyed this movie, in part for the nostalgic trip down memory lane of seeing an original 1947 movie.  Heartwarming story, well acted, and just the right length.\n",
      "Always a holiday favorite....now subtitled in French and Spanish too.Very nice quality and everything I had hoped for. I would recommend this DVD.\n",
      "One of my favorite Christmas movies. I remember watching it as a kid on our black/white TV. The color version is nice, too.\n",
      "I bought it because it isn't on TV as much anymore. It's one of the best Christmas stories of all time.\n",
      "Every time I watch this film, I think I need to start believing in Santa Claus again. As a man who claims to be the real Santa Claus gradually wins the love and respect of those around him, you are meant to wonder if he's crazy, or if he IS the real Santa Claus. The movie more or less leaves you to make your own conclusion, but I don't have to tell you the way the smart money leans on the question! LOLNatalie Wood gave a very mature performance for a child star of the day. Her own progression from a matter of fact little girl with no fantasies to actually wondering about Kris Kringle is one of the many delights of the movie. Another entertaining sub-plot involves a public relations campaign launched by Macy's Department Store after an inadvertent action by Kris winds up generating unexpected customer goodwill. Then Gimbel's gets in on the act, and the famous rivalry between the two retail giants is quite amusing.Maureen O'Hara is as beautiful and vivacious as in all her roles, and Edmund Gwenn is perfect as Kris Kringle. John Payne's friendly attorney neighbor provides just the right hopeful counterbalance to the practical nature of Maureen's character.The DVD video transfer is crisp, and the soundtrack sounds great. The package comes with both the classic B&W; version of the film, and the later colorized version. The colorized DVD has never left the case. ;-)This is a must see film for all fans of Christmas holiday films. Its on our must see list each year along with A Christmas Carol (any of a few versions), It's a Wonderful Life, The Shop Around the Corner, White Christmas, Holiday Inn, and A Christmas Story. We start after Thanksgiving and try to get in a couple a week until Christmas Day.\n",
      "A Classic... Edmund Gwenn IS Santa!  While the remake has its interesting moments, it pales in comparison to this 1947 movie (now gently colorized).  The color adds to the festive nature of the film, while still keeping its vintage charm.  The acting is well done and not cloyingly sentimental.\n",
      "If you were a child growing up in the fifties like I was you will certainly remember that there were three classic Christmas films that you had to see every holiday season. They were; 'A Christmas Carol' ('51), 'It's A Wonderful Life' ('47) and 'Miracle On 34th Street' ('47).'Miracle On 34th Street' is a charming, magical tale about modern day loss of innocence and joy and how one rotund old man with a white beard revives the \"Spirit of Christmas\" in an increasingly cyncial world. He sees little Susan Walker (Natalie Wood) as his test case. If he can't convince her that he is the real Santa Claus, all is lost.Will he succeed? Can he convince not only Susan, but the entire state of New York? Even more impossible, can he teach Susans' Mother (Maureen O'Hara) to open her heart and trust once again. Anything is possible at Christmast time!Edmund Gwenn is wonderful in the role of Kris Kringle and John Payne serves as the perfect foil and romantic interest for Ms. O'Hara. Director Geroge Seaton and an absolutely wonderful cast give the performances of a lifetime in this Christmas classic that belongs in everyones DVD collection.P.S.: I have to also mention the performance of Marlene Lyden as the Dutch girl who doesn't speak a word of English but wanted to see Santa anyway. This is without a doubt one of the sweetest moments ever put on film.\n",
      "it always brings out the spirit in me.it's heart-warming and the message is clear.it's one of the best movies for the holidays next to \"It's a Wonderful Life\"\n",
      "great to add this movie to my collection and at such a reasonable price.  price was so good, purchased two and gave one to a friend to add to their collection\n",
      "This original movie by far outshines any imitators!  It's a delightful, nostalgic look back into Christmas's past where innocence prevailed and prior to the commercialism that takes place nowadays - although it is just starting to get there in this movie!If you like to take a trip down memory lane and also enjoy the acting of a clever little Natalie Wood you will love this movie!\n",
      "I got this to replace my VCR tape that I have had for years.  I only watched the black and white version this year.  I does come with a color version as well but being a purist I watched it the way it was made.  Who knows next year I may go wild and watch the colorized copy!  I find it interesting that when the movie first came out it was released during the summer.  It back then still did well being opened during the summer.  What would be the chances of a Christmas move coming out in summer be today :)\n",
      "A great classic Christmas movie and now we don't have to wait for it to be available on TV (and NO commercials).\n",
      "Also lived in Clifton and Bloomfield, New Jersey 20 minutes by bus, to NYC. So brings back memories every time I watch it.\n",
      "This is the original and far better than the current remake. The quality of the image is wonderful considering how long ago the movie was made, but the story and acting is superb. Don't waste your money on the new version.\n",
      "Many are wonderful (Prancer, The Santa Clause) but nothing matches Natalie Wood and Edmund Gwenn for the real spirit of Christmas!\n",
      "A timeless classic.  It is part of every one of my holiday seasons. And I don't think it was aired very much in 2013.\n",
      "This is my favorite version of this movie. Another feel-good classic that keeps the faith in good will and humanity alive.\n",
      "Best Christmas movie ever. Be sure to see it in B&W, the original. Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night.\n",
      "...found a black and white version for my wife.  We watched it Christmas night.  There was quite a bit I'd forgotten.\n",
      "This is the black and white original version the movie my mom has been wanting this for years and i found it at a great price its a great Christmas movie. so yes i would tell someone to buy it if they are looking to add to their Christmas movie collection\n",
      "Great classic for the whole family! One of my Christmas favorites. I like this one better than the new one.\n",
      "I love this movie it's a perenial fav.... the movie quality itself on the authentic black and white version was a bit \"iffy\". But all in all a fine movie.\n",
      "I always enjoy this movie around Christmas. We do not have cable and that is the only stations that are showing this movie. Enjoyed the movie!\n",
      "Wonderful movie, reminds you of the good ole days! Wish we could go back to those days and people interacted more!!\n",
      "Buy one for each of your family.This is a great movie with family values and virtues worth emulating.Hard to believe people were like this, unless you were there.Heart warming, funny,\n",
      "Always a Classic. It was even better to this on Blu ray. I'm glad that a purchased this rather than a DVD.\n",
      "This movie is a must see for every generation.  The acting is superb and if you ever doubted that Santa Claus existed it will make you believe.\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie. Special as you get both color AND b/w dvds.  If you've never seen this (GASP!!) you need to. It's a Christmas Tradition all over the world\n",
      "I rated this movie 5 stars as it is an old classic which I have seen before, and we were planning on giving it as a gift and watching it with old friends on Christmas Eve.  It was guaranteed for delivery by Amazon on 12/24 by 8PM, and it is now 12/26, 10:30AM and the DVD is still not here.  Is Amazon going to be making good in some fashion on non-deliveries for their prime customers this season?  I look forward to hearing from you relating to this matter.  Thanks in advance for your attention.\n",
      "Can't beat the original Miracle on 34th Street.  The re-make is good, but the original is the best.  A classic Christmas movie that has to be watched every year.  I bought it to avoid trying to find it on TV every year.\n",
      "I have always loved this movie. The remakes are often ok, but none measures up to this version. Maureen O'Hare is classic and Santa speaking Dutch to the little girl still brings a tear. Don't leave it in the closet till Christmas. Watch it any time.\n",
      "This movie is a classic and is still one of the best Christmas shows we watch every year. We all love the Classics!\n",
      "My daughters and I just love this movie and we're so happy to have our own copy now. It's so well done and so heartwarming. We watch it throughout the year, not just on Christmas.\n",
      "I love this movie and this year it was not on TV. So I decided to buy it. I am so thankful I did.\n",
      "We received Miracle on 34th Street before we were expecting it.  It arrived before Christmas so our entire family was able to watch it with us.  The colored version was fantastic in Blu-ray.  It came in black and white as well as in color.  I would purchase movies again using Amazon.\n",
      "I gave this rating because this is one of my favorite Christmas movies and i was so in the mood to watch it on tuesday of this week while i was out and lucky for me you had it available for streaming. The quality was excellent\n",
      "This is a classic. It never gets old! I love this movie. Watch it every year. The story is timeless.\n",
      "This movie classic is one of those movies you must see every year at Christmas.  Edmund Gwenn is brilliant as Santa.\n",
      "I loved this movie long before there were VCRs, DVDs, and DVRs.  They used to show it on the Dialing for Dollars afternoon movie at Christmastime.  Great story, actors are wonderfully cast and Natalie Wood - has there ever been a cuter kid?\n",
      "I grew up watching Miracle on 34th Street every Christmas.  To me it is not Christmas without watching this classic. It is a great movie to watch with the entirefamily.\n",
      "Miracle on 34th street is in color with this special edition which I am used to watching tv. This edition also comes with both blu ray an DVD. Great deal for the price.\n",
      "What's not to like? This movie is a classic and should be shown to future generations to come. You have to \"believe.\"\n",
      "This is a great movie classic!  Amazon had a terrific price on this and Prime sealed the deal.  As others have noted, it is a 2 DVD set (one with the original BW, another with color).  I like the BW version as the colorized version seems a little unreal.\n",
      "Love this movie. It's a must see every year at our house. This is a classic movie. Packaging was great.\n",
      "The best christmas movie made.Its timeless.\n",
      "A wonderful movie about a child, her mom and Santa Claus, yes I still believe.\n",
      "Excellent!  A favorite for years!\n",
      "I like it because it make you feel like your dreams can come true and you feel like a child again\n",
      "This DVD has not only the original version, but the updated colorized version as well as the cut for TV version.  We are real pleased with this special edition and our grandson has watched it several times.\n",
      "Unless you live under a rock, you have seen this annual favorite every Christmas. A wonderful heartwarming story to rekindle the tiniest doubter about faith and goodwill. Kris Kringle (Santa Claus) goes on trial to prove his sanity after a run in with a Macy's store psychiatrist and has to prove to the world who he is. Events will make you laugh and even cry as you feel the government come to his rescue and little Suzy's (Natalie Wood) coming of age. See the movie!!!\n",
      "Miracle on 34th St is a childhood classic and watching it on blu-ray makes it as good as ever. I'll be watching it with my grandchildren someday soon.\n",
      "It doesn't have all the scenes, it's been edited.  It seems to be the consensus by many people giving ratings.  It's still good, but I wish it was complete\n",
      "A must have classic! This is one of my favorite Christmas movies even after watching it over and over for many years! Believe!\n",
      "This is the spirit of Christmas!! Old fashioned but still just as special as ever.  I think he is Santa Claus!\n",
      "This movie is very touching. Definitely an old classic. Has a fantastic message--not about Santa its about Christmas spirit and how if makes people act. Good and nice! Maybe more people ought to watch to be reminded what Christmas really means. This was the first time I have seen it and will be watching it again.\n",
      "Is Santa Claus real? And what does exactly does he look like? This movie answers those questions with definitive proof.\n",
      "This movie is so good and I love to watch it year after year.  I missed it this year, so decided to order my own.  The price was so good, too.\n",
      "I saw the remake of this in the theater before I saw this one but that was good so I picked up this one. The remake is better but this one is good too. Actually theyre both just as good at least in my opinion. This is one of the few movies that I watch which  is in black and white. like I said theyre both good . I especially like the way-in both of them but nevermind-that they proove Kris is Santa Claus. You should get this. Merry Christmas.\n",
      "classic!\n",
      "A classic!  A must see for kids of all ages at the holidays.  It's nice to be reminded that it's ok to be swept up in the sentiment of the season.  Enjoyable no matter how many years in a row you watch Miracle on 34th street!\n",
      "I have always enjoyed this movie! It gets better every year that I watch it. And I watch it at least once a year.\n",
      "Very good quality and of course it's one of the best Christmas movies! Blu-ray is so much better than your standard disc.\n",
      "This is my daughter's favorite Christmas movie. Maureen O'Hara always delivers a 'class-act' performance!My one critique is that on the Instant Video option of the movie it is NOT clearly marked that the film is delivered in black and white. It would be more appropriate for customer selection purposes, to label the film Clearly- - under the title- - instead of in the movie description. This is a film many viewers watch every year as part of their Christmas tradition, so many people will not be reading the movie description (which is where the black-white description is hidden).\n",
      "How could you not like this classic. I was going to buy the colorized version, but my 12 year old granddaughter preferred the black and white. A hit for Christmas.\n",
      "I used the same company for this item and the David Cassidy CD. They shipped together in one package. Movie is just like brand new! I couldn't ask for better service and quality of merchandise! Love this company and will probably use them again!\n",
      "I love this version of White Christmas. The santa is so believable and Natalie Wood is adorable. This is a must have for a holiday collection.\n",
      "This movie is timeless! One of those Christmas stories that live on through the generations. I enjoy watching it every year.\n",
      "This is a very feel good Christmas show.  A great one to watch and feel the spirit of Christmas time.\n",
      "Great family movie that is exactly as you remember it.  A welcome addition to your family DVD library.  Wish they made these nowadays.\n",
      "This movie is one of my Christmas favorites. This DVD is great because it's two disc with lots of bonuses: comes with the classic black-and-white movie and a colorized version too. I'm a huge fan of the original movie with Maureen O'Hara and Edmund Gwenn - the writing is so good and very witty, I just love it! (I didn't care for the remake of this movie with Mara Wilson)I ordered direct from Amazon and you really can't beat the prices + shipping. When I ordered, they were offering free overnight shipping for Amazon Prime members, but they offered an alternative 2 day shipping plus bonus Amazon Instant Video credit. I chose the 2 day plus credit and still got my movies the next day! If you shop Amazon more than 3 times a year and you're not a Prime member you're missing out.\n",
      "The original 1937 version of Miracle on 34th Street is one of the best Christmas movies ever made. It's played every December multiple times, but normally in the added color version, which ruins the film for me. It had been a few years since I seen the movie as my VHS version died years ago, but I ended up buying it on DVD, which includes the b&w and the colorized version, along with the 1955 TV-remake. Yes, the movie does gives the message that Santa is real, which may bother some people, but it is a harmless film that has great actors and dialogue.\n",
      "This is a wonderful Christmas story that never grows old.  Love looking at  the period clothes and the color is a great addition\n",
      "This is an interesting and cleverly worked out addition to the Christmas spirit via the movies.  It reflects the general delights of old movies and the quieter, more trusting spirit of the time.  Totally fanciful in theme, like most popular Christmas films, yet conveying its heart message with good effect.  Like any old movie, of any period really, there is always something to pick at if one wishes.  Old movie fans see those things as well, but generally have decided their preference over obvious flaws and detriments of modern films.  They have opted for the way things were more graciously presented, and Christmas movies are no exception.  This was made post-war when there was a need for regaining faith and hope, along with grace and beauty in everyday life.  People were receptive then and still appreciate it now.  It's always a treat to see different times gone by, men standing up when a lady comes into the room, people wearing dress clothes as a standard in businesses and courtrooms.  It also presents powerful heads of business as well as those leading the legal arena cherishing the same family connections as the rest of us.  The plot and other features are already noted here. Just hurrah for old Hollywood, despite its flaws, especially at Christmastime.\n",
      "Good casting! You can watch it over and over again.Will recommend to friends and family.  Natalie is a born actress.\n",
      "The transfer to Blu-Ray is outstanding for a movie this old. This is a must have, in your Christmas movie collection. Enjoy a classic movie with the entire family.\n",
      "This is one of the traditional christmas movies that we always watch and enjoy.  It is really fosters good will and shows the power of caring and kindness and faith.  Thanks Amazon.\n",
      "This is my favorite version of Miracle on 34th Street.  I watch it from Thanks Giving on through the new year.\n",
      "I love this movie, it was definitely worth the $2 or whatever it cost to rent it from Amazon for a couple days!\n",
      "I had forgotten what a great movie this is.  Christmas classic and my kids love it too.  Enjoy it.\n",
      "I bought this movie as a family gift. My wife and I have seen separate parts of the movie, but never all the way through. Last night we watched it together, and it is now a family favorite for the holidays.We particularly liked the fact that there are two CD's, a black and white and a colored version. What we really like about the colored version is that it does not have the digital remastered HD quality that all of the movies are going these days - we feel that this process ruins great films.We highly recommend this movie!\n",
      "This DVD does include both the b/w and colorized versions of Miracle on 34th Street, both of which have been restored and look fantastic.  I know there are a number of \"movie purists\" out there who would scold me for this, but I actually enjoyed the colorized version of this, as I remember seeing this version in the late 1980's on TV;  the process really brings the film to life and, at least to me, does not look artificial in any way.  Includes a wonderful commentary by Maureen O'Hara who fondly remembers the film & fellow actors (most of whom have passed away) with great detail.  This 1947 classic is the definitive version of the story (check out the 70's and 90's versions later, if you must) and is too good to be enjoyed only at Christmas.  A great DVD release!\n",
      "One of my all time favorite Christmas movies....no remake can do it justice. A keeper for your Christmas movie collection.\n",
      "I've always loved this movie, but in color it's amazing. It was such a joy to watch this Christmas season.\n",
      "HEY FOLKS!  CHECK OUT THIS MOVIE!  IT IS SO WORTH WATCHING!  IT WILL KEEP YOUR INTEREST AS YOU WILL NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.  THE VERY YOUNG NATALIE WOOD IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL HERE AND QUITE A WONDERFUL LITTLE ACTRESS TOO!  THIS MOVIE WILL NOT DISAPPOINT YOU AND IS GREAT FOR GETTING US INTO THE HOLIDAY SPIRIT AS WELL. ENJOY EVERYONE AND MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!\n",
      "great movie and a for the whole family. every american should have a copy of this movie in their collection!\n",
      "I believe. This movie is my very favorite and I Truely Believe !!! The 1947 version is much a part of every Christmas AT my home.\n",
      "Even in black and white, this movie outshines all the updated attempts of this amazing Christmas classic!  It's simply timeless!\n",
      "This is my favorite version of Miracle on 34th Street.  I even prefer the original black & white version to the colorized version.\n",
      "I was nervous about it being sold. in black and white, it was and I am happy about that. Thank you.\n",
      "This classic movie is timeless!!  I especially like it in the old black and white as it takes me back to a simpler time.  But I certainly enjoy the color version, too.\n",
      "This is one of the best Christmas movies out there.  It just isn't Christmas until I have seen it.  I must for families with children.\n",
      "Unlike a lot of critics who are totally against colorization of classic movies, my wife and I love them.  This is one of our favorites.  There;'s nothing more to say.  If anyone else know of any other colorized classic films we'd sure apprciate it.\n",
      "This is indeed the absolute BEST Christmas movie of all time!  The 1994 version I've never seen and don't plan to, because how can you compare it to this one, when the updated version has all Jews playing the Christian-based roles??  The 1947 CLASSIC deserves far more than only 5 stars!\n",
      "This is a classic..one of my all time favorite christmas movies!! Although the new versions are more modern, in the end I still prefer the original.\n",
      "Various folks have tried to remake this tale with decidedly MIXED results.  Why bother?  Watch this one over and over.  Gwenn is incomparable as Kris Kringle.  And who can compare with Maureen O'Hara as the self-made woman who is really a little girl who grew up too fast.  What a treasure to have Natalie Wood's performance captured for posterity.  Gene Lockhart and William Frawley give classic performances as well.  And don't miss a cameo by Thelma Ritter as the greatful mother.  Sure it's cheesy in spots, over-the-top even, but IT WORKS!!!  This one is an annual tradition in my house, and will be for years to come!This DVD version has an interesting look behind the scenes and a star-studded trailer as well.\n",
      "Why I choses this rating is basically once a year the tv industry would play this movie.  I would curl up with a bowl of popcorn when living in Wisconsin and watch this show.  Each time it seemed like it was a new movie and never seen before because of the month of the year it was televised once a year.  The holiday Spirit and emotion was attached to this movie.  I truly believed in what the movie was conveying.  It is how I treated my life up to now.  Whenever I did sales in retail I did exactly what Santa had done in this movie and that's how I became a top performer.\n",
      "It's not until you are well and truly wading through the wealth of special features on the 2-disc special edition DVD of the 1947 Christmas favorite \"The Miracle on 34th Street\" that one realizes that the release features not just two versions of the movie, but three.For not only does the release feature the original black & white version shown in theaters and the circa 1980s colorized version of the same feature film, but also hidden away on the second disc is the curiously titled \"20th Century Fox Hour of the Stars: The Miracle on 34th Street,\" which turns out to be a 46 minute 1950s remake for television that is surprisingly in incredibly good quality.The inclusion of this feature is indicative of Fox's loving tribute to this family movie gem that is this 2-disc release. Prior to its release the studio had no idea how to market what it considered to be an \"unimportant program picture\" and stuck it in the middle of its summer schedule with a trailer (shown here as a 5-minute promotional short) that did not feature one single clip from the movie and went at lengths to conceal it's Yuletide theme.The story is so well known that it hardly bears relating in this review. Suffice to say that it charts the efforts of a man (played in an Academy Award winning performance by British actor Edmund Gwenn) to be legally recognized as Santa Claus, which in fact he is and to persuade a doubting young girl (played by Natalie Wood in a star-turning performance) and a practical realist (played by Maureen O'Hara) that he is indeed Father Christmas. Picked to replace a liquor induced Santa as the Macy's Parade Santa he is a smashing success and indeed Gwenn's performance is so incredible that Natalie Wood really did believe that she was acting opposite Santa Claus.Perhaps the best special feature in this release (in what is a tough choice given its incredible company) is the feature length audio commentary by Maureen O'Hara. Recorded at her home in Ireland this past August the DVD warns us that this is merely excerpts of that interview with frequent silent sections. But I must say that this is happily not entirely accurate. O'Hara is clearly watching the movie (discussing elements on the screen as they occur), but also is more talkative than other commentaries that I have listened to that do not have a similar warning.In the commentary O'Hara recounts being forced to remain in the United States following the outbreak of hostilities in World War II and subsequently furious when (after being allowed to return to her native Ireland) on being ordered back to the U.S. to make this film. She tells us that other considered titles were \"The Big Heart\" and \"It's Only Human\" and how once she read the script she was determined to be involved in what she saw as a warm and affectionate movie. O'Hara also talks about the parade itself and reveals that it was the actual parade with people in the crowd not being aware that Fox was shooting a movie that day.Also included in this release is the 22-minute \"AMC Backstory\" that takes us behind the scenes of the production. Including are on-camera interviews with film historian Rudy Behlmer, actress Maureen O'Hara, actor Robert Hyatt (who played Thomas Mara Jr.), actor Alvin Greenman (who played Alfred), Natalie Wood biographer Suzanne Finstad and Natalie's sister Lana Wood. The documentary traces the genesis to the movie back to a fateful trip to a Los Angeles department store by screenwriter Valentine Davies. Fighting through holiday shoppers on 1944's Christmas Eve in an effort to buy a gift for his wife, Davies wondered what Santa Claus would make of the commercialism of Christmas. After working on the screenplay for over a year the project was optioned by Fox, who evidently had no idea what they had.In what was a huge risk the filmmakers agreed when Macy's and rival store Gimble Bros. said they would withold permission for their names to be used in the film until they had seen the finished film. Thankfully they loved it for if either store had objected Fox would have had to drastically re-cut and re-shoot major portions of the movie.So it was that at the height of the 1946 shopping season over 100 cast and crew descended on the Macy's store in New York City to shoot interiors of the movie and when it wrapped used the likes of Rex Harrison and Anne Baxter (who were on the Fox lot shooting other pictures) to rave about the production. Fox need not have worried though because it was a critical and commercial success staying in theaters for over six months and taking home three of its nominated four Oscars. In fact its popularity is such that it has not only been remade in the included 1950s TV production, but again in a 1970s TV movie and then in a 1994 big budget production (and clips from all three are featured in the AMC Backstory).An archival MovieTone News reel (running 1:42) covers those awards presentations and includes the famous quote from a clean shaven Gwenn when receiving his statue, \"Phew. Now I know there is a Santa Claus.\"But that's not all this bumper release contains. Also included is a 15:30 featurette on the history of the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade and in particular its pivotal role in the movie. This new documentary features on-camera interviews with Robert M. Grippo (author of a book on the parade) and John W. Straus who worked on the parade for 22 years and coordinated with the studio that the filming of the parade (with their 14 camera's positioned along the route) went off without a hitch.The special features are rounded out with nine posters for the movie.Audio includes English 5.1 Dolby Surround, English mono, French mono and Spanish mono. There are English and Spanish subtitles.NOTE: Amazon in its wisdom has attached this review to a different DVD version of the movie. They have a habit of doing this unfortunately. Please consider the date of this review and the fact it was for a 2-disc release.\n",
      "A classic.  Great cast.  Great for New York City history fans that want to remember the Big Apple in the mid/late 1940s.\n",
      "Top 5 movies. Can watch this all year.  Over and over again, week to week to week, month to month,year to year\n",
      "The message of this film is just timeless almost sixty years on.  I don't think I would allow less than a mature child to view this film not because the issue of Santa Claus' existence is called to question here.  Rather, the sight of adults behaving badly during what should be the most joyous and festive of holidays may be traumatic.  Whether Santa Claus exists is not the real focus here but the cynicism and commercialism of Christmas by those who should know better is.  The message is delivered subtlely by director-scriptwriter George Seaton.  Despite a happy ending this is strong stuff particularly for 1947 when Hollywood served up feel-good entertainment.  Edmund Gwenn, in one of those rare happenstances, was born to play Kris Kringle.  His mirth and good humor just envelope the screen.  Young Natalie Wood is a joy as young Susan, a child discouraged from believing in the fanciful.  Wood is just so natural and unaffected on the screen.  Amusing bit part here by Jack Albertson as a postal employee.\n",
      "This is defiantly a Christmas classic. this movie is awesome. I do however like the remake better. and you can't say that to much about movies anymore. but this one will always be a classic. this is a great Christmas movie. if you have not seen this movie I recommend you do\n",
      "This is easily the best Christmas movie ever. An amazing story, amazing actors, and just a lot of fun. This movie will make you believe in miracles.\n",
      "Best Christmas  Movie Ever made. Prefer the 2nd  Disc in Black and White as when child I saw it first in Black and White. However colorized version works great also. If you are collecting Chrsistmas DVDS this one is one you want to collect.\n",
      "I bought Miracle on 34th Street as a Christmas gift and it was a sensational hit! The recipient was very pleased.\n",
      "1947's \"Miracle On 34th Street\", starring the great Maureen O'Hara and Edmund Gwenn, is a motion picture that can be watched over and over again without losing one bit of its original flavor.  And its flavor is quite tasty, in my opinion!A very spunky 8-year-old Natalie Wood helps to make this movie an even bigger treat.  Natalie shows an acting talent in this film that belies her tender age. She gives one of the best performances by a child actor in a film I've ever come across.  \"34th Street\" was Natalie's 4th screen appearance, in a successful career that would eventually span 52 films before her sudden and tragic death at the age of only 43.Miss Wood seems well-suited for her good-sized role as \"Susan Walker\" in this movie. She blends perfectly with the other actors, and her scenes with Gwenn (who, of course, plays the part of \"Kris Kringle\" to utter perfection) are highly memorable.Could the studio have possibly found a better choice for the part of \"Kris\" (Santa) in this motion picture?  Well, perhaps.  But ONLY if the REAL Santa Claus were to have taken a break from his duties at the North Poll and played the part himself.  Oh...wait...Gwenn turns out to BE the REAL Santa, doesn't he? LOL! :)Yes, Edmund Gwenn actually DOES become \"Santa Claus\" for the 97-minute running time of this movie. He's *that* believable in the role. Gwenn was so good here that he won an Oscar for his memorable performance (Best Supporting Actor).This is a perfect movie to show your children. It must be a lot of fun watching a child's reaction to seeing Mr. Gwenn's very realistic portrayal of the portly fur-clad Christmas-time gift-giver. To a child that still does believe that Mr. Claus visits his or her house every December 24, this movie must be quite an eye-opener.This 20th-Century Fox DVD version of \"Miracle On 34th Street\" brings us the film in its intended (original) screen ratio of 1.33:1 (Full Frame); and the picture looks just dandy!  The film, which was shot in \"glorious black-and-white\", exhibits outstanding clarity on this DVD. I can't spot a bit of grain or \"noise\". An absolutely beautiful digital transfer. Especially considering the age of this flick.The audio comes via an English Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono soundtrack. The audio comes across nice and clean, with just a small amount of background \"hiss\" present. There's also a foreign-language track here, too (French). This French track (which is also 2.0 DD Mono) sounds a bit on the \"muffled\" side. Not nearly as clear-sounding as the English track.  There are subtitles in English and Spanish.There's not a whole lot to talk about in the way of \"Special Features\" for this DVD release. But there is the Original Theatrical Trailer and a short \"TV Spot\" advertising the movie (which is a bonus *not* shown on the DVD's packaging).  Plus: there's also a small text-only area on the disc, featuring \"Cast Credits\".I *must* say, however, even though we don't get many bonus extras with this title, I'm very pleased that the Trailer is included.  This Theatrical Trailer is one of the very best, and most innovative, I think I've ever witnessed. It's a relatively-lengthy trailer, which features a studio executive bumping into multiple actors while on the FOX movie lot. He asks several of these actors what they thought of the just-released picture, \"Miracle On 34th Street\". And what he receives in return (naturally) are glowing reviews for the film.It's a very well-done trailer, and doesn't seem overly \"hokey\" or staged. And it's very fun to see stars the likes of Rex Harrison and Anne Baxter pop up here, promoting \"34th Street\".  Harrison even speaks briefly in this trailer of his then-current work on \"The Ghost And Mrs. Muir\", which, ironically, also featured young Miss Natalie Wood as one of Rex's co-stars.  This trailer is a real treat. And it's in remarkably good shape too. Very good video quality. The audio for the trailer is in DD 2.0 Mono, and sounds just fine.Menus .... I like a good (and simple) Menu design.  And this disc has just that. The Main Menu is a \"static\" one, with separate links to other Sub-Menus (such as Language Selection, Chapter Listing, and Supplements). When you select any of these three items, you'll be treated to a very short (but fun and well-designed) animated transition, which then dissolves into the chosen sub-menu screen.  These short \"transitions\" are all slightly different, with each one featuring a Christmas tune playing as \"background\" music as the screen fades from the Main Menu to your desired selection.  This themed music seems as though it's being played over a Department Store's P.A. system (which is appropriate for this DVD, since we often hear the soft playing of Christmas tunes during the \"Macy's\" scenes in the film). One menu transition also features a \"snowflakes falling\" visual effect, along with the music. Very cleverly done, IMO.Additional Disc Information for this title ..............................>> Enclosures? .... Yes. There is one here. A one-page Chapter List insert is included (21 chapters), with an excellent promo picture of actors Maureen O'Hara, Natalie Wood, and John Payne on one side; and on the \"Chapter\" side, an image of \"Kris\" (Mr. Gwenn).  I particularly like the fact that FOX Home Entertainment used a different picture for the insert than what we see on the front cover (normally on DVDs, the two pictures are identical).  I might also add, in case one or two picky people might be interested in such trivial matters, that this insert is made out of better-quality (thicker) paper than what we usually see for such paper enclosures.>> Region? .... This is a \"Region 1\" (NTSC) disc. Single-sided.----------\"Miracle On 34th Street\" is one of those films that deserves to be seen more than once, and not only in the month of December either (IMO).  It holds up very well even in the summer months.  And this clear-as-a-bell DVD from FOX Home Entertainment makes viewing this 1947 classic an even more enjoyable experience -- no matter if it's in December, March, or August.\n",
      "The movie was given as a gift. The person who received it was very happy that it in color and black and white.\n",
      "This is an all time favorite that we watched on TV for years. We are very happy to have it in our collection.\n",
      "We must watch this movie every holiday season.I mean why not it is a true Christmas classic and with more than one version available this is my favorite one !\n",
      "This is a movie you can watch over and over again with your kids and grandkids!  This can become one of your Christmas traditions.\n",
      "We added this video to our collection it is one of the old video that we like and watch very often\n",
      "A classic!!!  Great that this DVD offers the movie in both black and white....and color!!  Great for anyone's collection.  Merry Christmas!!\n",
      "This film is exceptional -- exceptionally casted, acted and brings such joy to one's heart.  Maureen O'Hara and Natalie Wood steal the show, but the supporting actors are wonderfully casted. Edmund Gwenn is the only person who could have played the role of Kris Kringle.  A lovely movie for all ages, it reminds us to believe in the magic of Christmas!\n",
      "I think the remake is better but this will always be the classic.  Still love it though and the colorization adds a lot to it.\n",
      "Clasic Christmas movie that is a required watch every yearA Single Mother who is HR for Macys finds hope and ability to believe in Love again with Santas guidance\n",
      "This was something I looked forward to seeing every year. I watched it with my grandma when I was young.\n",
      "This is a wonderful family-type movie. Natalie Wood is so cute in it. Maureen O'Hara is as good as ever.\n",
      "I prefer the black & white version but alas not to be had. Color will do. Natalie Wood so cute in this\n",
      "this is one of the top ten xmas movies of all time. with out a doubt john payne and maureen o;hara, and young natilie wood bring the true meaning of xmas to the for front\n",
      "It hardly seems necessary to write a review on \"Miracle on 34th Street\" because it's hard to believe that anyone hasn't already seen the movie. I'm 57 and I'll bet I've seen \"Miracle\" 50 times. Every year somewhere between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve I watch it again and every year I laugh in the same places, somehow surprised over and over even though I know most of the dialogue by heart. I also develop a few little tears here and there, also at the same scenes year after year. And every year I find some new little detail that I've missed.Well, perhaps I'm a little too sympathetic having been born on Christmas, but I can't imagine what Christmas was like before \"Miracle on 34th Street\". It is a thoroughly delightful movie that could not be improved on by the two remakes since its production in 1947.Add it to your Christmas collection.\n",
      "This was a great movie. I have watched it numerous times over the years.However, it has the worst screen kiss. This kiss takes place in the final scene, just as the picture ends.It is between Maureen O'Hara and John Payne.The first time I saw the movie, when I saw this kiss, I was startled at the way the kiss was acted out. It was to harsh and without finesse, and lacked any romantic appeal for this type of movie. He pressed her mouth so hard, it made lines on the side of her face. It certainly was not the type of kiss that matched this type of movie.\n",
      "quality-one-collectors, the company that sold me the movie (DVD) was fabulous to work with. They were caring, helpful, thorough and above all did what they said they would do. Quality-one-collectors just do it right! I would recommend highly and I look forward to doing more business with them soon.\n",
      "For those confused by the range of views expressed about this Blu-ray release of Miracle on 34th Street, here's a URL to get you to the High-def Digest review. I found this review to be quite helpful. After reading it, I ordered the Blu-ray. [...]\n",
      "We have always enjoyed this classic Christmas story.  The order came in on time and in good condition, and now we can share it with our Grandchildren whenever we want.\n",
      "One of my favorites since I was a child, plus like the black and white.  Good remake with the new one also\n",
      "What can you say about this classic. Everything from the writing to the santa chause, the kid and all top nouch\n",
      "I have been a staunch supporter of the United States Postal Service my entire life because of their role in saving Santa Claus.\n",
      "wouldnt have a Christmas without seeing it.  it's always a pleasure to see Natalie wood especially.its a classic!  Everyone should own it.\n",
      "I have always loved the depth of this movie especially the commentary on psychology as a profession and how damaging it can be young people!\n",
      "A classic Christmas favorite. Still as entertaining and beautifully produced as the day it was released. Without flaw,brilliant performances and an incredible and sweet story. The young Natalie Wood is remarkable. Hollywood at its best.\n",
      "We liked the tale and the fact that this movie made in 1947. This movie was a god ending for our Christmas Day. The only drawback was it was to quiet, depite the volume was to max.\n",
      "Everyone should know this movie by now, I just wanted it available during the season and watch when we are ready without commercial interruption.\n",
      "I am extremely satisfied with this product.  My family and I enjoyed watching the DVD over the Christmas holidays.  I would recommend this Vendor to ALL of my friends.  TB Lloyd II, USN (ret)\n",
      "Reminds me of home. Always watched on thanksgiving day after the Macy's Parade. Very disapointed that the \"Powers that be\" have not put it on TV. Now, I get to watch when ever I want.\n",
      "Amazon still has the wrong information about this Blu-ray, which they claim to be in color.  I received it yesterday and am happy to report that it is only in black and white.  I deleted my previous \"review\", in which I was concerned that this Blu-ray might be color only.I rate the movie as a 5/5 but the Blu-ray picture is not as sharp as I had wished.  I still gave the product a 5/5 because I think this is the best presentation this movie will ever be because of the age of the movie.  It beats the DVD, which is enough to prompt me to buy the Blu-ray. It is also possible that the original film was shot with soft focus.\n",
      "Great classic Christmas Movie. A must see every Christmas, usually more than once. Maureen O'hara, and Natalie Wood have Oscar worthy performances.\n",
      "Miracle on 34th Street is a classic Christmas film.  To be able to view this story at your own descretion is great and to see again Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Edmund Gwenn adn Natalie Wood as a little girl is priceless.  There is a Santa Claus\n",
      "I love Christmas and I love to watch Christmas shows. This a good classic, clean family movie. everyone has to believe in something.\n",
      "This is my favorite Christmas movie of all time. My husband and I look forward to watching it together every year.  It is truly a classic.\n",
      "This is the best movie; so much better than all the remakes that have been done. I always watch it when it is on tv.\n",
      "I love this movie.  The acting is so very good,...and the emotions brought out are many.  The story line is, of course, simple.... a man who claims to be Kris Kringle... Santa.  This movie was made a long time ago, before 'political correctness' of the ignorant and character-less world of today evolved to what it is.  Had the movie been made today, Kris would have had to take the verbal abuse of the idiot 'psychiatrist' working at the major departments store, and Kris would have been relegated back to the 'home' from which he came.  And the judge would never have allowed the issue involving 'Santa' come to court.\n",
      "Miracle on 34th Street is a classic not only because of the attractive characters, the fantasy ending, the humor, but also because of certain structural subtleties which are not noticed by the casual viewer.The movie consists of a series of threats to Kris Kringle and a series of events which neutralize those threats.In the first place, once hired as Macy's Santa, Kris starts sending customers to other stores. When Thelma Ritter (perfectly cast) tells him he shouldn't have promised her son a fire engine (\"Macy's hasn't got 'em, nobody's got 'em\") Kris replies, \"You don't think I would have promised the boy unless I was sure, do you? You can get those fire engines at Schoenfeld's, an excellent bargain.\"Mr. Schellhammer, the manager of the toy department, overhears this and is horrified. He is on the point of firing Kris when Thelma Ritter walks up to him and congratulates Macy's on \"this wonderful new stunt you're pullin'.\" So Schellhammer has to think twice about firing Kris.Meanwhile Mr. Gailey (who will eventually be Kris's attorney) takes Maureen O'Hara's daughter Susie to see Kris. When Susie overhears Kris speaking Dutch to a little Dutch girl, her skepticism (inculcated in her by her cynical mother) is challenged. Doris responds to this by firing Kris.No sooner has this happened than Schellhammer tells Doris about Kris sending customers to other stores. Mr. Macy is excited about the idea, so they both have to un-fire Kris.So much for the first threat to Kris.The second threat comes when Mr. Sawyer, Macy's psychologist, takes a dislike to Kris and tells Doris he has to be fired. But this threat is neutralized by the doctor from the old people's home on Long Island who comes into Doris's office and says Sawyer is exaggerating, Kris \"only wants to be friendly and helpful.\" Despite Sawyer's snide denial of this, Kris remains as Santa and even engineers a handshake between Macy and Gimble.At this point we might think that Kris is free and clear, there are no more conflicts. But the movie would be boring without the third and most dramatic conflict.When Kris finds out that Sawyer is psychoanalyzing Alfred, the innocent boy who pushes a broom at Macy's and likes to play Santa Claus, Kris hits Sawyer on the head with his cane. Sawyer pretends the injury is serious and gets Kris committed to Belleview.This sets up the climax of the movie. Gailey tells the judge (Gene Lockhart) that he intends to prove that Kris IS Santa Claus.The judge would throw the case out, but William Frawley (perfectly cast as his political adviser) says, \"You go ahead and rule there's no Santy Claus. Wait til the candy companies, the Christmas tree companies, the toy companies hear about this. You're gonna be an awful popular fellow.\"The judge sees the problem, and rules that the belief in Santa Claus is open to debate, a matter of opinion. \"I will hear arguments on both sides.\"The District Attorney rests his case after asking Kris, \"Do you really believe you're Santa Claus?\" and Kris answers \"Of course.\"Now it is up to Gailey to prove that Kris is the one and only Santa Claus. This he cannot do. The Mayor, the Governor, refuse to put in writing that Kris is Santa Claus.In a touching moment Gailey puts Mr. Macy on the stand. \"Do you believe this man is Santa Claus?\" Macy ponders. He sees newspaper headlines saying \"MACY ADMITS HIS SANTA IS A FRAUD.\" Then he see the happy faces of the children whose lives Kris has touched, and humbly says \"I do.\" Applause in the courtroom.Now for the tour de force of the movie. Gailey is stuck. No person in authority will publicly say Kris is Santa.We cut to Susie writing a letter to Kris addressed to the courthouse. \"I hope you are not sad. I believe you really are Santa Claus.\" Doris appends to the letter, \"I believe in you too.\"The letter arrives at the post office, where Jack Albertson suddenly gets the idea of sending all the letters written by Santa to the courthouse. Gailey introduces the letters as proof that a government agency certifies that Kris is Santa Claus. The judge, relieved to be off the hot seat (and the multiple shots of Bill Frawley pointing his cigar at the judge, now warningly, now approvingly, are hilarious), rules, \"If the U.S. Post Office says Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus, this court will not dispute it.\"The letter from Susie is overdetermined in two ways: first, its content goes to the cynicism she has learned from her mother, which Kris has now overcome. Secondly, the letter sets up the happy ending.So MIRACLE is one of the most intricately structured movies ever made, along with perhaps THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. Every scene is overdetermined, with meanings reaching down to the thematic depths of the story while driving the action forward.A great example of film structure at its best.\n",
      "A true classic!  Enjoy it year after year and passing on this copy to our daughter for her two little ones.\n",
      "I love the nostalgia related to when I actually believed in Santa Claus and the world seemed so magical....This evokes all those memories!\n",
      "I have loved this movie forever. It is a true classic. I would recommend it for any age. It is a wonderful movie.\n",
      "I ordered this a few days before Christmas and it got here in plenty of time to send it to another state as a Christmas gift.I was very happy that I did not have to get out in the crowded stores at Christmas time to find it\n",
      "This movie is one of the best for the holidays.  It makes the Christmas season seem more wonderful.  Seeing this is as heartwarming and magical as a movie can get.  The acting is superb as well as the directing and writing.  Anyone who doesn't like this is a grump.  Life is full of magic , just look for it.\n",
      "This is one of my wife's favorites and is one of the best classics of all time.\n",
      "An Explanation of the \"Everyman\" reference by way of introduction:The morality play Everyman (c.1495-1518), is a Medieval telling of a simple tale casted by actors representing various human attributes, and failings.  The cast includes such characters as \"Everyman\" as well as various human characteristics with whom this representative human must interact. They include, for examples.  \"Death,\" \"Knowledge,\" \"Lusty Wenches,\" and \"Goods.\"  It is NOT a comedy!  The characters are not carefully drawn individual humans, as we have come to expect in `good' films and plays, but rather they are human personifications - representing in each character, a singular aspect of the human condition.  Almost like casting a show with the various pieces of a single person to watch them interact - an idea which has probably already been accomplished - likely, off Broadway.  If not, someone ought to give it a thought.On To The Review and Commentary:In any event, \"Miracle on 34th Street\" is such a story.  Yes, there are characters played by real actors.  Some of them, quite good, including the well known and accomplished character actor who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for this piece of performance work in 1947, Edmund Gwenn as \"Kris Kringle\", the old fellow who really believes himself to be `the one-and-only Santa Claus\"; John Payne as the attorney who proves that to be true in a New York City/State court; Natalie Wood as the little girl who has learned cold, hard skepticism and concreteness from her wounded and frightened mother - portrayed nicely by Maureen O'Hara.  But while there are many other characters in the film, they are, in this context, less important than the human qualities and flaws and potentials that they represent.  Seen in this way, \"Miracle on 34th Street\" is a Morality Tale for All Times - especially for our own.For those of you who may remain, nearly 60 years after its production and release, unfamiliar with the basic story, I shall briefly summarize it for you:  The famous Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade - the official opening (in 1946-47) of the Christmas season of selling and celebration in New York, is the responsibility of Susan's (Natalie Wood) mother Doris (Maureen O'Hara.) Susan is a single parent having suffered a failed romance and marriage with who she had thought was \"Prince Charming\" but who turned out to be someone far less desirable. She is concrete, skeptical, businesslike and appropriate, yet curt and painfully devoid of any fantasies or dreams.  These deficiencies are deliberately taught to her daughter, who shares her complete lack of faith, hope and trust - also, they are equally devoid of imagination.On this one special Thanksgiving morning, the parade's Santa shows up intoxicated and needs to be replaced. PRESTO!  Kris Kringle appears, dons the costume and performs miraculously well! Everyone is happy.  The problems begin to develop when \"Big Greed #1\" (in the character of store owner Wm. H. Macy) hires him to be the store Santa - thinking it likely that his jovial and lovable presence will increase the Toy Department's sales. Before too long, everyone realizes that old Kris really believes himself to be Santa Claus, and all heck breaks loose.  Of course, as a `romantic comedy' made in 1947, everything resolves beautifully - the good get regarded and the bad get their just deserts. In between, however, an important metaphoric staging of the human condition and many of its (our) basic dilemmas are played out by actors representing, as in Everyman, basic human characteristics.For example: Kris Kringle (Santa):  Goodness, unqualified love, hope and trust. Susan (The little girl): The reality of youth's struggle with reality vs. imagination and faith. Doris (Susan's Mom):  Hurt and disappointment. Mr. Gayly (The attorney): The converted hero who proves faith to be warranted. Mr. Sawyer (The store psychologist): Envy, pettiness and cruelty. Arnold (Assistant Janitor): Youth's better inclinations, vulnerable though they are. Mr. Macy:  Big Greed #1. Mr. Gimble: Big Greed #2. Mr. Shelhammer (Toy department Manager): Little Greed #1. There are many other characters portraying many other aspects of who and what we are - have been - or might yet become.I could go on and on - but I think the essence of my point is clear.In the interaction of these people/characters/aspects of humanity - a wonderful story is played out for us. A story filled with inspiration and thought-provoking light moments.The plot is slight, the sentiments unarguable sappy and the black and white photography is lovely.  I urge you to 1) Rent or buy this film and watch it (without the televisions nuisance commercial interruptions) sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas together with your entire family.  It is a far better, less violently and anguishing film to watch than the much touted \"It's A Wonderful Life; and 2) Avoid wasting you time on any of the several remakes (two on film and one for TV) of this film.  They got it right the first time - also it is worth avoiding the `colorized' version as the addition of a color pallet actually detracts from the magnificent simplicity of the tale itself.I actually watch this movie every year - it helps to get me into the `spirit' of the holidays as they might have once been and, given the good efforts of good people, might once again become. It's 97 minutes you won't regret spending in front of your TV.This particular special \"50th Anniversary Edition\" has been Digitally Remastered yielding a MUCH better resolution that even the original 35mm film, and it also includes some wonderful extras including a string of original `Trailers' shown in theatres prior to its release in 1947.  Some of the unexpected cameos in these trailers - as well as the theme of them - are best left unrevealed by me.  The surprises in them actually add to the wonder of the film itself.Don't miss this one! It gets better with each and every viewing.\n",
      "Miracle on 34th street is a genuine classic. Although there have been several remakes of this delightful story, this -- the original -- version is by far the best. Edmund Gwenn's superb performance as Kris Kringle won him a well-deserved Academy Award, and the rest of the cast are also quite good -- including the young Natalie Wood as the little girl who learns to believe in wondrous things, such as Santa Claus. This movie is well established as a holiday treat, but it is also a great movie without regard to genre.\n",
      "At least once each Christmas season, our family sits down with the old fashioned black and white version of this classic, and it really brings the Christmas spirit to all, even those of us who have seen it dozens of times since we were children. The final scene can bring doubt to even the most hard-hearted of Santa deniers.\n",
      "I can't heap anymore praise on this film.  We all know that it's a classic!  Five (hundred) stars!!\n",
      "I don't think I have to review the actual film here. It's not as if most people haven't seen it. But I will say that this film does have it all: lighthearted moments, dramatic scenes, poignant times and lots of hope for the future of Christmas and the characters involved in the story. When asked \"What's your favorite movie\" I always answer \"Miracle on 34th St\" without skipping a beat. I love that it's a slice of life from 1947 but is a relevant story for today.This current DVD addition is nice because of the extras, although I really wish that there was a film historian on the commentary along with Maureen O'Hara. I think another person would've prompted her a little more to tell more antidotes, like on the Black Swan DVD commentary. I like the AMC Backstory documentary because it gives an insight to the film's history and some wonderful interviews with people who were in the film.Please don't re-make it again - there's no improving on perfection.\n",
      "This is one of the most liked holiday films of all time! And I can see why. The Santa Claus is hilarious in this film, and he gets saved by a wonderful acting lawyer. Throughout the film, you'll see that everyday people are thinking of Santa as a crazed maniac. But it all turns out great at the end. And it gets better in 1997!\n",
      "DVD was in good shape and played well.  We enjoy it each Christmas and hope you can enjoy it also.\n",
      "I watched the original black and white version. It looks and sounds great.  I didn't buy the video for the special features, so I didn't pay much attention to them.I would recommend Miracle on 34th Street to everyone, young, old, or in between.\n",
      "This is a great Christmas movie.  There are no computer generated special affects; there are just lots of interesting characters who together make a very entertaining and uplifting movie.  It's great for family viewing -- no foul language, suggestives undertones and no nudity.\n",
      "bought this dvd for my girl its one of her favorite holiday movies so the price was great for this classic and the quality is just as expected\n",
      "A GREAT OLD BLACK AND WHITE CLASSIC THAT IS OF GOOD QUALITY !!!  THIS WOULD BE A WONDERFUL ADDITION FOR ANY BLURAY CHRISTMAS COLLECTOR'S LIBRARY !!!  EDOFTENNESSEE\n",
      "My wife and I enjoy watching this movie every year.  It's a classic story that never grows old.  I highly recommend this movie!\n",
      "One of the Christmas classics that you can watch in the original black and white or colorized (both included in the \"special edition)\n",
      "The remakes have been good, but this is still the best \"Miracle on 34th Street\"! You don't need to wait for Christmas to see this!\n",
      "Love it, have watched it twice so far, replacing all VCR tapes with new DVD's.  Should bring years of enjoyment to our home.\n",
      "Delightful story and great acting.  We watched the black and white version and the picture and dialog were very clear.\n",
      "My wife just loves this movie, and I just had to get it for Her, This is a classic at Christmas time and a good all around Familymovie that everyone can watch\n",
      "I know there have been several remakes of this movie - all of which of good. However, to me you cannot beat the original. Tells a great story of someone who does not believe in Christmas finding there is magic in Christmas.\n",
      "My husband and  I save this movie for Christmas Eve every year. Boy was it nice to be hooked up to Amazon and not deal with a dvd. It is so charming and good for all ages.\n",
      "This movie brings back wonderful childhood memories along with being TOTALY delightful! Brings you back to the way department stores used to be!\n",
      "My family as not watched the color version yet, but we will. My wife and I watched this movie every year a couple of time from the early 50's and we always enjoy it. This DVD replaces a VHS that has seen it's day. I recommend it for all ages.\n",
      "Movies like this make Christmas very special.  Another classic Christmas tale no house can do without.\n",
      "I received The Item The Other Day and have not had the chance to watch it with my husband I had purchased it for my husband for Christmas he loved the gift he has been asking me for this movie for awhile now thank you for being so quick about the shipping time\n",
      "The \"dreams come true at Christmas\" (especially at Macy's...) premise of this film could have become syrupy sweet had it not had the brilliantly skillful handling that makes this a fun classic. Much of the dialogue (handled, of course, by top actors) is wryly hilarious. Scenes I particularly enjoy are the conversations between Kris and Alfred (\"make a buck, make a buck!\"), anyone's chats with the young but wise Susie, and the wonderful Bill Frawley's reminding a judge that, especially with elections forthcoming, declaring there is no Santa Claus could have devastating consequences. The scene of Kris's trial (where the \"allegedly mentally ill\" old man so clearly has far more good sense than those around him) is brilliant.The acting is marvellous - no one, including Kris, is a caricature, other than the self-proclaimed \"psychiatrist\" who takes a swipe at Santa. The balance between \"playing the characters straight\" and actually quite sophisticated humour is extraordinary.The key for the viewer, of course, is to remember that Kris indeed is Santa Claus. The setting, where two major department stores unwittingly end up fighting for a greater image of detached good will, is social commentary, albeit of a very different sort, which Dickens would envy.\n",
      "It is  a classic movie from a different time.And a message of faith for everyone. Susan Hayworth just adorable.\n",
      "This is the only Miracle on 34th Street worth watching.  The re-makes are terrible.I watch this movie even during the summer.  It is a feel good movie.\n",
      "I have always loved this movie and although I had an old VHS dubbing of it I was pleased to find this one so cheap on Amazon.  I only watch the black and white version as it does include a colorized version too.  I don't understand why the industry...Ted Turner started it....feels a need to colorize a very successful black and white movie.  It was intended to be viewed in B & W and it should stay that way.\n",
      "I have always loved this film. Simple as it seems, I enjoy it all the time, no matter how many times I see it. I even prefer it to its latter versions. Both the black and white and the color editions are in perfect shape, although I always prefer the black and white version. I can't think of any disappointment if any buyer purchases this edition.\n",
      "Love this DVD.  The service through Amazon and the dealer was perfect, as usual.  How could you not want this older version of Miracle on 34th Street for your family!  The perfect gift.\n",
      "A delightful holiday tale of people's lack of faith and the road back to it.  This is the original and is a must have for holiday lovers of all ages.  Younger children will not enjoy it as much as the older ones.\n",
      "just got this brand new at f.y.e. for 5 bucks. It was an impulse buy at the registor for christmas time.\n",
      "Love this movie! Very happy with the reasonable price and how fast it was ordered and received :)Unless it was free-could not be better.\n",
      "When you think Christmas Movie their are a select few that have lasted the test of time.  This is defantly one of them.  But do see the color version. It does add a little something more.\n",
      "Want to get into the mood for the upcoming holiday? Well, it's always helpful when you watch these classic Christmas films. A majority of them are always fun to watch, like It's a Wonderful Life and Home Alone. The original 1947 version of Miracle on 34th Street may not be perfect, but it still manages to bring that warm holiday spirit by asking the question: Is the Santa Claus for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day real or not? It's such a heartwarming film, and anyone can enjoy it, whether you celebrate Christmas or not.\n",
      "Order was recieved promptly and in great condition. When I ordered this movie, I was under the assumption that it was the \"in-color\" version. However, when I got the DVD, I was so happy to realize that it was a two-disk series with all the special features as well as the original black and white and the new color generated versions. Nice touch and for a wonderful price! Thanks!!!Movie~BuffErin L.Monroe, GA\n",
      "It's a classic! This movie has grown up with me and every time I watch it I learn something new about the human spirit.\n",
      "I first saw this on tv as a teen and have loved it ever since. I need not tell you how great it is, and that it's by far the best version. Other versions fall flat compared to this one.*There are some memorable lines in this tale that are timeless.NOTE: A reviewer herein says there's BOTH B/W and COLOR versions in this package.So that ought to satisfy everyone.Family or not, 'buy this', make some hot chocolate, get comfy and ENJOY! :-D\n",
      "There isn't anything about this movie that isn't perfect.If you've never seen it, you've never had Christmas at your house.Ed Gwynne turns in a stellar job as Kris Kringle.  Natalie Wood is charming and perfect in the role.  Maureen O'Hara -- well, what do you say?  Most beautiful woman in film history, and one of the best actresses besides.What will impress viewers is the quality of the supporting cast.  I agree with another reviewer -- my favorite, choke-me-up-and-I-don't-care-who-sees-me-sniffle scenes is the one with the little Dutch girl.But the scene in the post office sorting room...and the scene with William Crawly (Fred Murtz) and the courtroom cop over his cigar...well, I could go on and describe the entire film, but could never do it justice.There are no special effects.  You will not believe Santa can fly.  But you will believe he's Santa.Get this and watch it whenever you need a little Christmas.  Highest recommendations for the whole family.\n",
      "This movie is one that I must watch each year. The acting and storyline are top rate. This gets me into the spirit of Christmas\n",
      "Naturally, Amazon has asked for a review of this purchase before I have even received it.  I have seen this movie more times than I can remember.  I can quote lines from it.  I will no doubt continue wating it as long as I have breath in my body.  The cast is perfect.  The writing surperb.  There is nothing about this picture that is a negative.  There have been imitations, but none have come close to this production.  I would have to place it easily in the top ten Christmas movies of all time, and near the top of the list at that.  In spite of the fact that it was not originally intended to be a Christmas movie, it will always be a must see every Christmas.\n",
      "I had this movie before on DVD but it got lost. So when I saw the special edition out I had to have it. It arrived in great condition and I love the fact I was able to get it in black and white plus a color version too. Another must watch for the holidays.\n",
      "I never saw this one as a child but every time I have seen this one over the years it brings out the child in me. For me it ranks up there for the holidays along with\" Its a wonderful life\".\n",
      "I loved this movie when it first came out.  I still love it now that I am 71. This last Christmas it was one of the first Christmas moview that I watched.  I am glad that the movie is still around after all these years.\n",
      "By now most people have seen this movie so I won't waste time reviewing the movie content.  But, if you are thinking of purchasing this DVD, you should do it.  Even though this is a movie from the 1940's, the quality of this DVD was excellent.\n",
      "truly a classic, much better than the newer remake version.  good any time of year, not just at Christmas time.\n",
      "This old time favorite shares that children need a time to really have a balanced view of living. All is not science and facts there is a lot of mystery and joy to life.\n",
      "\"Miracle on 34th Street\" opens with a wonderful holiday feel to it, as the camera follows an elderly gentleman down the sidewalk of a busy Christmas holiday New York street. The scene develops into the Macy's Department Store Thanksgiving Day parade, with the elderly man discovering that the man that Macy's has hired to portray Santa is disgracefully drunk!  Doris Walker, (Maureen O'Hara) who is Macy's special events director, persuades the elderly man to take his place, telling him how much that he looks like the \"real' Santa! The elderly man proves to be a sensation and is quickly recruited to be the store Santa at the Macy's department store!  While he is successful, Ms. Walker learns that he calls himself Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn) and he claims to be the actual Santa Claus! Despite reassurances by Kringle's doctor that he is harmless, Doris still has misgivings, especially when she has cynically trained herself, and also her young daughter, Susan, (Natalie Wood) to reject all notions of belief and fantasy. And yet, people, especially Susan, begin to notice there is something special about Kris and his determination to advance the true spirit of Christmas amidst the rampant commercialism around him and succeeding in improbable ways. Kris even brings together department store rivals Macy and Gimbal! When a raucous conflict with the store's cruelly incompetent psychologist erupts; Kris finds himself held at Bellevue where, in despair, he deliberately fails a mental examination to ensure his commitment. All seems lost until Doris' lawyer friend, Fred Gaily, (John Payne) reassure Kris of his worth and agrees to represent him in the fight to secure his release. To achieve that, Fred arranges a formal hearing in which he argues that Kris is sane because he is in fact the real and genuine Santa Claus!  What ensues is an incredibly entertaining hearing in which people's beliefs are reexamined and put to the test, but even so, it's going to take a miracle for Kris to win!\"Miracle on 34th Street\" (1947) has got to be one of the best and original Christmas stories ever made! You'll delight at the scene of Susan watching skeptically as Santa is talking to the children in the department store, and he talks to both the French children and a special little Dutch girl, who he also sings a song to! Susan is amazed that this man knows so much about children and even speaks different languages! The movie's finale is what makes this movie such a wonderful Christmas experience! To see an ordinary lawyer like Fred Gaily represent a seemingly ordinary man like Kris Kringle and in a brilliant moment Fred uses a government service to prove that, not only is this pleasant little man Kris Kringle, but the one and only Santa Claus! And it's all played out on Christmas Eve! You would think that after this scene that the movie would end- not so! Another wonderful scene awaits, and will have you saying, along with Susan, Doris, and Fred- \"He REALLY is Santa Claus!!\"\n",

      "----Miracle on 34th Street is a beautifully written gem of a picture, with a pitch-perfect balance between cynicism and human kindness. Edmund Gwenn IS Santa Claus in his Academy Award-winning performance, and Natalie Wood belies the oft-repeated criticism of the overly-acted, under-performing \"child actor,\" by delivering a performance that is at once as believable as it is tender.-----One performance to especially watch for: Gene Lockhart as Judge Harper; he is absolutely hilarious as a jurist of the Supreme Court of New York, worried about his reelection chances if he rules that Santa doesn't exist. William Frawley, as Harper's political guru is also especially effective.---- The depiction of the baser side of humanity takes the form of corporate greed, cynicism (on the part of Doris) and disbelief (Susan), and the mean-spirited smallness of a nasty little man (Macy's store \"psychologist\"). In addition, greed is frequently depicted among characters (Doris and the Toy Department Manager worry about losing their bonuses if they fire an apparently insane Santa---says the manager to Doris: \"Maybe he's just a LITTLE bit crazy---like painters, composers, and some of those guys in Washington...\").--- One of my favorite scenes is when a young Dutch orphan meets Kris (Santa) with her adopted mother. The mother explains to Kris that the girl was just adopted from Rotterdam, and that she doesn't speak any English. What follows is a darling scence where Kris speaks to the child in Dutch, and sings \"Santa Claus\" with her in the same language-----What modern audiences wouldn't know---but audiences in 1947 would--- is that Rotterdam was the site of one of the Nazis most infamous and horrendous blitzkriegs, which focused particularly brutally on civilian housing. The number of children and women killed in that city was appalling, and represented the highest fatality rate of children of any Nazi bombing raid during the entire war----the number of orphans left in Holland afterwards was very large, thus, this scene provides an additional emotional punch as audiences would realize the child was a survivor of a blitzkrieg.--- The very fact that this movie remains not only relevant, but only seems to increase in popularity, some 65 years after it was first premiered, speaks to its timeless element. I do believe that if Macy's Thanksgiving Day parades, and visits to Santa at the Mall were passe, modern audiences would probably have a more difficult time relating to the film, despite the timelessness of its subject. But the fact that our traditions have remained largely unchanged---most particularly in regards to how we, as a society, try to protect the imaginations of our children---the film still resonates. Even 65 years later, audiences still feel an unease when confronted with a small child's disbelief in anything magical and her very adult cynicism towards life in general....--- Miracle on 34th Street does not represent \"great art\" or a larger-than-life subject matter, but it does represent something far more precious: the enduring human need of faith, and the bounty one reaps from small acts of kindness.\n",
      "Beside the fact that this is a total classic must-watch movie, this story is an original with great actors and great subtle humor. Natalie Wood is so cute, and does such a great job! Also, I love seeing how life was back in the day... ie; we laugh about how huge the newspapers used to be, how much the times have changed the way everyone used to dress up for everyday living... just realizing how much we've changed (for the better, and the worse).The other thing that makes this movie my favorite is that the lawyer's son is my brother, Bobby Hyatt. He is so cute. He has since passed, in 2007.Here is a clip from his teen years. He is the brother of Natalie Wood in a TV series from the 50's. Love it![...]\n",
      "20th Century Fox's 1947 Miracle on 34th Street has become a staple for the holiday season.  It has a warm charm to its mystical allure.As everyone knows, it's a story of belief.  A single mother, Doris Walker, is raising her 8-year old daughter, Susan, without the assistance of make-believe or her former husband.Along comes an old man with a glint in his eyes for the miracle of Christmas.  He audaciously declares that he is Kris Kringle, the original who just happens to work in Macy's Department Store as Santa Claus.Mr. Kringle has come to New York City to confront the commercialization of Christmas. As he states to Doris Walker:\"For the past 50 years or so I've been getting more and more worried about Christmas. Seems we're all so busy trying to beat the other fellow in making things go faster and look shinier and cost less that Christmas and I are sort of getting lost in the shuffle.\"Of course, she finds him amusing until her daughter begins to believe that he is the real thing. Toss in the store psychologist with a Scrooge demeanor and you have a story which plays out in a courtroom. The judge wishes he had never gotten this case on his docket, with an ambitious district attorney who wants to make a name for himself.It has a great cast. A historical note: it was released to the public on May 2, 1947 because Darryl F. Zanuck, studio head, believed the ticket sales would be better in Summer than late Fall and Winter. He had grave reservations about the film. The original trailer in the winter of 1947 was vague about what the film actually was.It was nominated for best picture.  It won Oscars for best supporting actor, screenplay and original story.\"Faith is believing when common sense tells you not to. Don't you see? It's not just Kris that's on trial, it's everything he stands for. It's kindness and joy and love and all the other intangibles.\"\n",
      "This is my favorite Christmas movie of all time, seen the newer versions but only once, no one near as good as the original.  While most people pick \"It's A Wonderful Life\" as their favorite and while it's a great movie, Miracle is my favorite.  It's more a Christmas movie than Wonderful is.  It's around Christmas, has Santa Clause, the believers and non believers, perfect!\n",
      "Beloved Edmund Gwenn, a secondary but deluxe actor. In Spain he acted in a film of the years 50's titled 'Calabuch' whose work in it was very appreciated.\n",
      "Christmas classic with the best possible message. A family favorite for years. We had an old VHS tape of it, but the Amazon stream was a much cleaner viewing.\n",
      "I've seen it before at my son's home, & it does rate 4-Stars. I bought this as a gift, since his VHS tape of the movie is worn out.\n",
      "There have been several versions made of this story; however, this is the very best!!!  Absolutely love to watch this every year.\n",
      "Love this version of Miracle on 34th Street, watched it a couple of times because once is just not enough and I just love old movies brings back great memories.\n",
      "Christmastime is not complete without Macy's Santa Claus.  This still is a wonderful way to help celebrate the holiday season.  Get cozy and make plenty of popcorn.  Oh, get out the hanky, too.\n",
      "Excellent movie and had wanted it on blu- ray. The only thing is that I didn't realise that it is in black & white. Thought it was in color because of the packaging\n",
      "Who could not like this very family minded classic Christmas movie that is geared for the whole family. Modern Hollywood could learn so much from movies like this and a story like this. If you really like the holiday season you will forever think you just watched the real Santa when you watch this wonderful movie. I loved how great it looked on my roku box from Amazon videos, it looked just like the dvd. I hope everyone will watch this great Christmas story every Holiday season.\n",
      "It's simply a classic. Great characters and acting. Makes you feel good at Christmas time.(Although I do prefer the original B&W; version)\n",
      "This was a gift for my wife. It is her most favorite Xmas video and I'll use it as a stocking gift. Order time and delivery were very timely and much appreciated!\n",
      "I love this move really shows the Christmas spirit from the eyes of children. it's a special Christmas movie and should be on every Christmas shelf. The blue-Ray transfer is spectacular and looks great for such a old movie.\n",
      "Great movie but in buying the Blu-Ray version I would have guessed it was to be the colorized version, but it was not. Even says on the back description that its in the new colorized Blu-Ray. They do have the movie in a two disc format B&W and colorized version DVD which was $2.00 cheaper, but I wanted the movie in Blu-Ray. Don't understand why they would even make a movie that's B&W in a Blu-Ray version. Out come of all this is that I wrote Amazon and they refunded my money and was able to keep the movie. Very nice of them. Amazon is the first place I look if I want to buy something.\n",
      "Bought this film because it's a great holiday film. I've been watching this film since I was a kid in the 1950s. Had to add this to my DVD collection. It's a really great film. Everyone is wonderful and little Natalie Wood is just delightful! She sure did grow up to be a very beautiful woman. Too bad she died so young. Anyway the film is a delight.\n",
      "I got this in Blue Ray for the longevity and the quality.  I love Blue Ray, it's very durable and the high definition works good when it's from an old film movie, they seem to be able to make it so crisp and new.  A must have Christmas Classic Movie.\n",
      "This is such a great movie. The acting is superb,  the costumes  are so period,  and there us no re-make that can do it justice!!!\n",
      "The family snuggles under warm blankets, enjoying the classic story of the Miracle of Christmas.  I was only two when the story was first told, but enjoy it over 60 years later with my granddaughters in the early dark nights of December.\n",
      "Great Christmas classic.  Showed this to my children for the first time this past Christmas and they loved it.  At or near the top of our Christmas movie list.\n",
      "This is a treasured classic in our family and I love that I was able to get it so easily - purchased as a gift for a family member.\n",
      "One of my favorite Christmas movies from growing up.  Just a great, heart-warming tale with excellent acting and excellent story line!  Yes, there have been remakes, but none of them can compare to the original.  Skip the horrible remakes and buy the original.  You won't be sorry.\n",
      "I am a huge fan of this movie and am pleased to have my own copy to watch whenever I want.  Sometimes I watch the colorized version and sometimes I watch it in black-and-white.  I don't own very many DVD's but I would not be without this one.\n",
      "I have always loved this movie and I want to see it every Christmas season. It's my favorite version - with Natalie Wood. It's timeless.\n",
      "Having grown up watching this movie in the 1950's, I exposed our children to it during their childhood. It became a \"must see\" during the holiday season. Now our third generation is sharing this family tradition. It is enjoyed by all.This year,our oldest grandchild, 14, put in a personal request to have her own copy. Her future Christmases will be filled now with many family memories.\n",
      "This a wonderful movie about love and faith and belief in good things.  We watched it with my almost 10 year old who has \"almost\" concluded that Santa Clause is really someone other than the guy from the North Pole.  This movie helps one \"believe\" in Santa a little longer, even though one may already be convinced otherwise.  I a friend of mine told me when his (now adult) daughter asked if Santa was real, his answer was, \"If you 'believe' in Santa, he will continue to bring you stuff.  If you don't believe in Santa, he won't.\"  She continued to believe in Santa for a long time afterwards.  I will NEVER admit to my daugther that Santa does not exist, only that if she believes in him, he will be there for her.  This movie touches on that belief.  Is he or isn't he?  This was the right year for my daughter to see this movie for the first time.  For now, she still \"believes\" in Santa and by that I mean, I think she likely knows that Santa Claus is a game we ALL love playing and she still wants to play.  Showing this movie to kids earlier than 4th grade, will introduce the idea of whether Santa Claus is real and I NEVER wanted to go there until I had to.  Enjoy the movie with your older child.\n",
      ".............I am a New Yorker(73rd St E.) and a bartender to boot, so I have kind of given up Christmas as a time to deal with amatuer drunks who have priced us out of the Upper Westside(aka.CHIPS, you know, loafers with no socks, upturned collars and cheating wives) so, I haven't watched this film for years. I rented it this year(2004) on a whim and was surprised what an impact it had. Great movie to overcome the cynical times we live in. It actually does remind us what it is all about. Great for New Yorkers to see Manhattan when it was great. We already knew, New York at Chistmas is magic, don't let the CHIPS and lame people get you down-Greg-NYC\n",
      "As for Santa, well...the New York Supreme Court ruled, along with the Federal Post Office that Santa Claus is real, or so the ending of this film boasted.  Watching it from beginning to end will warm your heart and give you encouragement.  We're not all as horrible as we may seem.  Edmund Gwen's performance is classic, as well as Maureen O'Hara's and John Payne's, not to mention little Natalie Wood.  Who would've figured where her star would've led to.  A GREAT film!!\n",
      "This is a wonderful and heartwarming movie that all should watch each year.  It is ideal to watch right after the Thanksgiving Day parade. Love it!!!\n",
      "This is an excellent DVD!  However, I especially enjoy the special features included in other DVD's.  This only includes a commentary with Maureen O' Hara.\n",
      "I actually watched the black and white version of the movie.  The color version is included in this two disc set however.  The \"special features\" included really blew me away.\n",
      "I have Loved this movie from childhood. Everyone should see this young and old. It's what Christmas is all about. Great classic movie of all time. I watch it every year on t v. I can now watch it year round.\n",
      "One of the classics. I have been watching this since I was little and I still love it and now my kids do too!\n",
      "This is one of the best films made. Since the age of 8 I have watched Miracle on 34 street and the Christmas Carol 1938 version.I have never miss ether of these shows in the pass 50 years.\n",
      "An old fashion family classic that we watch every Christmas.  A timeless treasure!  EVERYONE WILL ENJOY IT!Share with friends & relatives,\n",
      "Always a perrenial favorite, watching the Blu-ray edition makes you feel so much more a part of the story.  The clarity is amazing... you won't be disappointed in acquiring this release!\n",
      "Guess my wife figured we needed it in the cabinet to watch all year is why she bought it.  I am sure we will enjoy it many times.\n",
      "this movie is an all time great.  I bought it because even though we don't really believe in Santa the person, the true meaning of Christmas is held in each and every heart.  This movie always brings a tear to my eye\n",
      "Is this movie sappy? Well, yes. Yes it is. Is it still a great movie? Again, yes. Yes it is. I'm not even a Christian, and therefore don't celebrate Christmas, but I still watch this movie every year on December 25th. Why? Because it's fun! It's fun, and it has a great message behind it. So, I suggest you introduce your kids to this movie, if you have any, they'll love it!\n",
      "This is my favorite Christmas Movie.  I watch it several times each year.  The only movie I like better is It's A Wonderful Like, Starring James Steward (Black and white version is preferred)\n",
      "How could one not love some of these original Christmas specials.....I remember seeing some of these as a child and still love.\n",
      "Quality stands the test of time and this one is definitely quality.  Well acted and never slips in sloppy sentimentality.  It is also a welcome relief to see the child star (Natalie Wood) do a professional job and not weep her way or cute her way through her part.  The balance of the cast is outstanding (in my eyes) for their professionalism in handling what could have been a sloppy sweet telling.Bought this to keep and share with family and friends over the coming holidays.\n",
      "One of my favorite traditional Christmas movies from an era when I was a child.  I like it much better than more recent remakes.\n",
      "Kris Kringle is working in Macy' s and suddenly will encounter a beloved child (Natalie Wood) . Eventually they will go to trial to prove he' s Santa.This is a stunning and resounding film that gradually has become a status reference, due its imaginative flight and human meaning. The delicate frontier between reality and fantasy in order to preserve the first years of our existence remains backstage.A cult movie all the way.\n",
      "One of the best old classics, I've seen it many, many times. Made in an era when acting was really required in movies.\n",
      "The Blu-Ray version is excellent and a pleasure to watch!  Well worth adding to one's collection to watch over the Holidays.\n",
      "Plus there are bonus features and the original promotional trailers from 1947.  The video quality is great and sound is good too.  Plays well on HD TVs.  This movie is classic for good reasons and can be watched over and over.  The competitive capitalists are swayed to do good.  The super ego psychiatrist is brought down..  The lawyer wins the case that his firm wouldn't take.  The child gains imagination and faith.  Mom loosens up.  Santa wins the day.\n",
      "I love this movie and had to buy it! This dvd is jam packed with both the color and black/white version with some extras. 5 stars!\n",
      "There is nothing better than watching the holiday classics to remind you of how things used to be. This movie is a must during the holiday season and is a staple with my family on a yearly basis.\n",
      "This was delivered very fast. The movie picture is clear. Wonder classic Christmas movie of all time.  Love this movie.\n",
      "A must for the holiday season.  It can't be Christmas without watching this movie!!  Our whole family loves this, its the true spirit of Christmas.\n",
      "The transfer is clean. It showed really well on my home theater system. Not to boast, it showed well on 120\". You'll want to watch the opening with great street level views of older NYC.\n",
      "A Holiday Classic, nicely packaged, under $10.  Would recommend to anyone for gift giving or adding to your own collection.\n",
      "We love this movie so much we actually watch it first of all of our Christmas movies.  In fact we usually start watching it in September to get us in the spirit.Movie has some great one liners and we can pretty much recite most of it by heart.The colorized version is okay, but we prefer the black and white because that's what we grew up with.  A must see every year.\n",
      "This was always my favorite movie and now I was able to share it with my grandkids. They now love it as much as I do.\n",
      "Christmas is my favorite holiday.  While I know there is no Santa, this doesn't keep me from really enjoying the great Christmas films that we have available.  This is one of the best.  I have the newer version also, but still prefer this one.  It is a classic and each year I try to watch it at least twice.  It arrived from Amazon in a very timely manner and in very secure packages.  Thanks again, Amazon for helping me add a classic to my collection.\n",
      "They can try, but there is no better version of this story than this one!  Every station should play this movie on Thanksgiving, especially right after the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.  Who the *blank* thought to put a dog show on after the thanksgiving parade?  SO.....buy yourself a copy of this movie so you can follow the better tradition!\n",
      "This is a wonderful story.  Natalie Wood was a very good child actress.  She was so cute in the movie and played her part well.  I gave this to my daughter who has seen it many times.  It is her favorite Christmas movie.\n",
      "Come on now!  We all know this is a classic at Christmas or any time of the year that you need to believe again!\n",
      "One of the best Christmas stories out there! And watching it on Blu-Ray makes it even better! I highly recommended it for the holidays!\n",
      "Seriously, this is a classic in my household. Love this version (not the new one). Watch it every year at Christmas and it still touches my heart.\n",
      "Perfection was struck when they made this movie. Why they even bothered with the awful remakes is beyond the comprehension of even the wisest of people. I'm not going to go into a plot detail. One reviewer described Thomas Mara Jr. getting his oversized football helmut Christmas morning. I tried going to every site possible and can find no mention of that scene. Besides that scene doesn't sound all that monumental. Now if that beautiful, throat lumping, eyes welling up, I hope everyone in the room is watching the movie and not me scene with the little Dutch girl was cut, THAT would be a far better reason to boycott this dvd. But they haven't. It's all there. With all the bonus features this 2 disc version is a must have. If you have the previously released DVD the cute 5 minute trailer is known as (promotional spot) on this set. Disc 2. There's a nicety to having both the colorized and original Black & White versions. I'm comfortable watching either one. I am amazed and disgusted as I find a growing number of morons oops! (I mean people) who flat out refuse to watch anything that's in Black & White. No matter how good it is. I suffered through the 1997 remake with my then wife who totally refused to watch this version simply because it was in B&W. The color version looks a little drab. A little adjustment of the tint and color settings from your TV may be necessary for the best possible picture. I know alot of people are upset because a classic B&W movie has been tampered with. Chances are, maybe the filmakers wanted to film this in color, but Fox studio exec Darryl F Zanuck did not grant a large enough budget. After all this is a Christmas movie. Who wouldn't want to display all the wonderous colors of Christmas. If this dvd was offered as a colorized version only, I would still buy it. Why? Because I could always turn the color completely off on my TV and instantly have the classic B&W version. I dread the thought of movies being colorized just to draw in knuckleheads who didn't have the respect for the classic films in the first place. Yet I'm curious as to what would something like Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein look like in color. Wow! Sorry about the tangent. This is a great movie colorized or not.\n",
      "Some movies never get old and this is one of them. Had reservations about the colorized very of this classic but it is very well done.\n",
      "I finally found the original film in BLACK and WHITE the way it was meant to be seen. Don't mess with a classic.\n",
      "This is another Christmas movie classic! I grew up with this as a traditional movie we watched each Christmas season. This never gets old with us! The moral of the story....hope is always there! And miracles do happen!\n",
      "I always looked for it around the holidays so i decided to get it for myself to watch anytime i wanted to. i think it is very warm and heart felt\n",
      "I love this move!  Spouse and I watched it last night and love it.  Have wanted for a long time.\n",
      "I have to say I have seen the remake more times then this one but I like this one just as much. i like the acting,story and the directing. The problem is Susie I found her to be a spoiled brat. the story is cute as a girl dosnet believe in Santa Clause and a man says he's the real thing. the good thing about this movie is we dont know if he's the real thing becouse all the stuff he dose can be done. The movie is a fun original classic holiday film.\n",
      "Excellent movie and in High Definition.  Better than the 10 year old DVD I have.  Highly recommended for all ages.\n",
      "Although black and white is great the color adds a new twist.  You will enjoy this seasonal classic. The past is great.\n",
      "one of the best!!great sound and picture on blu ray,natalie wood was the best child actor of her time.an unforgetable performance.it is worth watching and rewatching\n",
      "Was a last minute addition to cart and was hoping it included colorized and black and white. But its only the classic B&W.\n",
      "This movie is an excellent example of the meaning of \"Christmas Spirit!\"  Wonderful story, excellent cast, and it is shown in black and white and not colorized.  I thank the seller for being so nice, and I would recommend them to everyone!!\n",
      "For years our family, having grown up and become self-sufficient, decided to donate to a few charities rather than buying presents (except for the children).  Besides making for a much more relaxed holiday season, it let us get past the frenzy and allowed our minds to better appreciate the meaning of Christmas.There are some things that generate sights and smells and memories in our hearts.  This movie is one of them.  For what Christmas could be complete than lounging together as a family and watching some of the Christmas classics.  Certainly \"Miracle on 34th Street\" is one of them.\n",
      "Oddly enough, I never saw this film as a child and was an adult for the first viewing.  Cynically, I didn't expect to enjoy it much.  So much for cynicism - the magic of the film and its message got to me.  And it still does every time I watch it.  Edmund Gwenn is excellent as Kris Kringle, the man who is a dead ringer for Santa Claus because he IS Santa Claus.  Natalie Wood is the young girl (a cynic herself) who doesn't believe in him, having been taught by her mother, Maureen O'Hara, to be very realistic and practical.  Not only was Wood a great adult actress, but she was also a gifted child star, delivering lines and emotions like a pro.  Thelma Ritter has a small bit as a frustrated shopper, but she's a standout, as is the rest of the supporting cast.  This film reminds you of the joy and magic that every Christmas should bring, whether you're an adult or a child.\n",
      "If you have never watched this, you really must. It helps you recall the magic of Christmas and it appeals to all ages. I watch it one time each year.\n",
      "The proverbial Christmas Classic. You will find yourself believing in Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Kris Kringle, Jolly Ol' Saint Nick all over again. It's a feeling that one should never allow to leave ... if that spirit should ever lag, watch the movie again!\n",
      "Been one remake of this story, but don't bother with it...Get this one!  The first and the classic!  It always amazes me that the USPO comes through in the end to prove Kris Kringle is the REAL Santa Claus!  HA HA\n",
      "It has been our tradition to watch this.  It was and still remains an awesome movie that touches ones spirit.This is for my kindle fire HD and it was a very clear movie and sounded great.  You have to buy it to believe the quality you will get.  I am so glad I got this and with my christmas present early, the kindle fire HD it was amazing.  Now time to wrap it up and act surprised.\n",
      "Watch this movie with children. The will along with adults believe in Santa. What a great Christmas movie. Great Blu-Ray edition.\n",
      "What can yo say about an old classic?  This is one of those you must see.  Something about how they made movies back then was really neat.\n",
      "This is a classic family christmas movie with great actors and a great story.  You will always feel better after watching this movie.  This purchase has the original b&w and a 2nd colorized DVD (keep one give one to family).\n",
      "I like to have all the different movies of Miracle On 34th Street, it's a wonderful show. Great to have a fire going while you are drinking eggnog and enjoying the story.\n",
      "Watched this traditional favorite while preparing the Thanksgiving feast.  This is a movie that can be watched numerous times.  Even more fun knowing my daughter was in New York watching the parade!\n",
      "I bought this as I wanted to see the colorized version. I'm sure the puristswould not go for that, but as its a Christmas film its wonderful in color.\n",
      "The best movie to start off the holiday season and a must view on Thanksgiving day for the family.  Love this version much more than the updated one because the characters focus on the message of the season rather than slap-stick, obvious humor.\n",
      "This is one I must see every Holiday Season!  The quality is great. I highly recommend this version of the film.\n",
      "Always a Christmas favorite with my family.  My family has loved this movie for it seems a lifetime. Watch every year.\n",
      "One of my childhood all star favorite movies. The transformation of a mother and child from unbelieving to believing in Santa Clause. great cast of actors and a chance to see Natalie Wood as a child. We love it.\n",
      "Every Christmas our familty used to put our Christmas tree up and watch this movie at the same time. It was a family tradition. This Christmas this movie wasn't on any of the channels so I downloaded it from Amazon and we put the tree up. The screen is really little so we had to do a lot of stopping to watch the most important parts but at least we got to see it as a family. I feel really bad that the traditional Christmas shows have been completely disregarded this year for crap or that you have to pay to watch them. Christmas is about giving-it seems these new fancy channels want you to pay for everything. That's to bad, this movie is really special and a lot of the kids growing up will never get to see it and feel that warmth of family while they're watching.\n",
      "One of most wonderful Christmas movies. Never get tired of watching it every year. It brings back many memories of times gone by.\n",
      "I love Maureen O'Hara and Natalie Wood.  Somehow the remakes just don't do it for me.  It makes the magic of Christmas stand out.\n",
      "this is a good movie, may be a little serious for my nine year -granddaughter but her Mom wil watch it with her and she will enjoy it\n",
      "We enjoy this classic film each year.  It is interesting to choose between the two CD's: one in color and one in black and white.\n",
      "This is one of my very favorite holiday movies.  I watch it several times during the Christmas Season and after.\n",
      "It's AMAZING and a SHAME that they don't play this on TV anymore.  I have all the comcast channels and have not once seen it airing on TV.  Maybe I missed it somewhere.  I know every year they come out with the new releases and they keep playing them over and over and over again.  All they need to do is play each new release ONE time LESS and they could get this movie on the air quite a bit.\n",
      "Years ago we bought a 50th anniversary VCR tape of this movie, the B&W version. We are in the process of replacing all our tapes with DVDs. We had looked for this one, but found only the colorized versions. We were excited to find this one. I was a little disappointed that it didn't start with the movie trailer like the tape did, but when I checked out the extras there was the trailer. Love it!\n",
      "This heartwarming story reminds us that \"common sense\" is not always \"reality\".Common sense tells us that a store Santa at Macy's should push only Macy's products to customers. Otherwise, Macy will be throwing away business. Instead, the new store Santa (Kris Kringle) sometimes refers the customers to a competitor (Gimbels) when the latter has the product that the customer actually wants. The counterintuitive result? Customers appreciate this and Macy's sales go way up.Common sense tells us that a man who is convinced that he is Santa Claus is delusional, and may become violent. The psychologist at Macy's recommends that Kris Kringle be committed into a mental institution. Will common sense prevail?The mother of little Susie, evidently embittered by her divorce, wants to disabuse her daughter of anything like Prince Charming or Santa Claus. Only real things should matter. Little Susie does not even know how to play imaginative games with other children her age. Kris Kringle must teach her how to pretend to be a monkey. Finally, both mother and daughter are forced to reconsider their \"common sense\" attitudes towards Santa Claus.Common sense tells us that there is no Santa Claus, and no court should ever waste its time on this matter. The judge doesn't know what to do. If he rules according to common sense, that there is no Santa Claus, he will commit political suicide. There is no way of canceling the court proceedings, and it is impossible to prove the existence of Santa Claus, much less that old man Kris Kringle is actually Santa Claus. Right? I won't spoil the ending. Watch the movie and find out!\n",
      "Gwenn won an Oscar as THE man who spreads the true meaning of Christmas and embodies the spirit of Yuletide. Fox mogul Daryl F. Zanuck predicted a lukewarm public response when he viewed the film: he distributed it in the  summer of 1947; it was still playing 6 months later when millions of  children were posting letters to Santa! One of the great fantasy classics  of all time, it contains particularly appealing performances from little  Natalie Wood and, of course, the magical Edmund Gwenn.\n",
      "Awkward, formulaic, even leaden at times: there's just something about the sentiment in this movie I can't resist.This isn't a great movie, but it's a good one. The very premise -- standing up to common sense at a time of the year when we want so much to believe in the inherent goodness of people -- can get you right where you live if you're willing to give yourself over to it. Edmund Gwenn and (a very young) Natalie Wood help us to do just that.The rest of the cast is a bit stilted, but it just doesn't matter. Besides, the 90-second screen debut of Thelma Ritter would make any movie a gem. (Naturally, she manages to do in those 90 seconds what most of the cast struggles to do in 90 minutes: make us believe that what we're watching could be real.) A great story, some great performances and a truly great sentiment.\n",
      "This movie has always been a favorite and this configuration is wonderful.  Can't wait to see all the extras.  Merry Christmas to all.\n",
      "One of my fav's! They did a nice job of remastering the old movie which makes it very enjoyable to watch.\n",
      "It really is a great classic and one the whole family can enjoy. My 4-year-old even sat through it and that is saying a lot. She is not easily amused when it comes to old films or anything that is not animated for that matter. A must have if you are looking for a good Christmas film.\n",
      "I absolutely love this movie.  It is not Christmas until I see this movie.  The colorized version is gorgeous.  It makes everything very real.\n",
      "Beautifully restored version - watch it in black and white for best original.  Always loved this story.  Kris Kringle is truly Santa Claus!\n",
      "watch this movie at least twice a year. dear Amazon, I watch this movie at least twice a year. I am reminded of Christmas's passed with my family. My parents are gone now, but the memories are always there for me.\\thank you for being there for us sentimental people.  Joanne  Hall\n",
      "This is my all time favorite Christmas movie, which I watch every now and then through the year. I comes with two dvd's the original movie in black and white and in color. Makes a wonderful gift to enjoy for years to come.\n",
      "I ordered this as a gift for my husband.  it came early and in great shape.  he was very happy as well as i\n",
      "I know, its old and it's in black and white but it's still my favorite Christmas movie. I saw it when it came to my little town at four years  old and try to watch it every year. The re makes are okay but they don't have the magic this one has and they try so hard to make it more modern or pc. Stupid Hollywood, leave perfection alone. Watch it, buy it and enjoy it.\n",
      "After my daughter said she and her daughter was watching it Christmas Eve I decided I needed to watch it too. I started the tradition and my granddaughter may follow thru when she has a family.\n",
      "I originally had this movie on VHS and decided to upgrade to Blu-ray.  What a difference!  Excellent picture quality and sound, plus I appreciated the extra bonus features, which includes an interview with Maureen O'Hara.  Extremely happy with this item!\n",
      "This is a terrific film. I prefer the black and white version. Just like \"To Kill A Mockingbird\", it's a mistake to colorize it in my opinion. I love the characters, especially Natalie Wood and Edmund Gwenn, the best Santa ever.\n",
      "This is my favorite Christmas movie of all time.  I highly recommend it to everyone!  In Blu-Ray, it is even more amazing\n",
      "\"Miracle On 34th Street\", written by Valentine Davies and George Seaton; directed by George Seaton. (Spoilers abound, because I can't imagine that anyone who can read this hasn't seen this film yet).It's the classic story of kindly Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn), a Macy's store Santa who firmly believes that he really is Santa Claus. Hard-bitten Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) and her level-headed daughter Susan (Natalie Wood) don't buy it for a second. But is he telling the truth?As long as there's been Christmas (and Christmas movies), filmmakers have struggled to capture that feeling many of us associate with the season. Like many other subject matter, Christmas is a high-wire act, and audiences are more often than not subjected to a dunking in treacle. What is it, then, that makes this film so effective? Why has this story thrived for almost sixty years, surpassing the inevitable remake and imitations with nary a blemish?The obvious answers are true: it's extremely well written, directed and performed. Everyone in the film is tremendous, and naturally Gwenn and Wood are the standouts. It's impossible to imagine anyone being a more convincing Santa than Mr. Gwenn, and young miss Wood's acting is expressive and touching. It's a real challenge to make literal-mindedness and pragmatism appealing, and her success seems effortless.Like many great movies, every choice feels as if there were no other option. Imagine setting this at a store in the midwest. The writer easily could have done so, but by setting it in New York City, the iconic heart of tough-minded me-first cynicism, the sentimentality has fertile ground in which to bloom.That's reflected in the script again and again with a salty, grounded edge to amost every character decision. Parade manager Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) doesn't simply choose Kris because he's kind-hearted and a dead ringer for Santa - she grabs him off the street in desperation because the Santa that she hired is passed-out drunk. It's also echoed in the skepticism of almost everyone that Kris comes across. Everyone likes him, but they're pretty sure he's a bit of a nut. Kris is so good in the parade, though, that he's quickly hired as the flagship Claus for the store.Things are allowed to continue as they are - Kris 'plays' Santa at Macy's - with no one needing to seriously question his identity. Business is booming, and as long as Kris isn't seen to be a danger to anyone, his 'eccentricity' gets a pass. Even a huge potential misstep - Kris begins to recommend products from competing stores to customers - transforms into a goodwill epidemic among the retail chains. Naturally, this balance doesn't last long.Kris make a friend with Alfred, a young janitor who loves playing Santa for the kids, too - but both he and Kris fall victim to the Macy's employee screener, Granville Sawyer (Porter Hall). Literal-minded to a fault, Mr. Sawyer believes that Kris is deranged, and will cause harm if his delusion is threatened. But the straw that breaks the reindeer's back is when Sawyer begins to psychoanalyze Alfred, convincing him that his love of being Santa is the result of a guilt complex in his childhood. This infuriates Kris to such a degree that he clonks the would-be Freud on the head with his cane - and that's all the ammunition that Sawyer needs.He sets in motion commitment proceedings, an action even the hard-boiled Macy doesn't want to take. But it's too late. Fortunately, Santa has a lawyer - Fred Gailey (John Payne), who lives near Doris. While both Fred and Kris have ulterior motives concerning Doris and Susan - Fred wants to get to know Doris better, Kris wants to introduce Susan to imagination and faith - the script does the tricky job of keeping our sympathy.Another great choice is to make Kris' first (literal) defender an adult - another stong contrast to the watery-eyed moppet who believes, believes, believes from the first frame to the last. Additionally, Doris and Susan are the last to make that emotional shift.The stakes are high, too - Kris isn't simply going to be fired and sent packing out into the snow. If this case is lost, he'll be committed to Bellview asylum for good. We get a little taste of how broken and unhappy he'd be when Kris weakens and deliberately fails the psychiatric exam, effectively committing himself. His faith in his fellow man is shattered, but fortunately lawyer Fred Gailey (John Payne) convinces him to keep fighting - deftly setting up the courtroom sequence.Fred take the best path a lawyer could use - he pressures the prosecutor to prove that Kris isn't Santa. No one wants to say there's no Santa on the stand, for a variety of savvy, unsentimental reasons. The prosecutor doesn't want to crush his son's dreams of Christmas. Mr. Macy won't, because he doesn't want to make headlines as the man who planted a fake Santa in his flagship store in the heart of the shopping season. The judge doesn't want to drop the hammer on Kris, either - he wants to run for public office soon, and there's lots of voter alienation hanging in the balance. Eventually, though, the hearing reaches the inevitable - the judge is duty-bound to require concrete proof from the defense. Where could that possibly come from?That proof - delivered when a couple of postal workers send fifty thousand letters to the courthouse, helping Fred prove his case that Kris is the \"one and only\" Santa Claus - is a choice made simply to help clear out the dead letter office. It's a choice that could have been terribly maudlin if both mail workers had melted in light of Kris' plight - but with that opportunistic shade, it's so entertaining that we buy it whole-heartedly. Of course, it's also beautfully set up by having little Susan (Natalie Wood) first write her letter of support when things look darkest.The theme of faith is endlessly reflected in the script. Doris needs to have faith in love (Fred), Susan needs to have faith that Kris will bring her special gift, Kris has faith that Fred will prevail, and everyone, as we know, needs to have faith in Santa Claus.\n",
      "This is a great movie,as many have posted before me. However, after hearing the classic radio show (heard it on Sirius)  originally aired around the same time as the orginal movie release, I learned something entirely new about this old classic I enjoyed for many years. In the classic radio show at the end when the lawyer talks with Santa about the house, he learns that Santa set the entire sanity trial up, Santa knew the lawyer could not afford the house unless he bacame a famous lawyer, and by going to trial it made the lawyer famous. I never realized that Santa set it all up by making them think he was crazy, but it makes sense that Santa could be that smart.\n",
      "One of the best!!!  An absolute christmas classic!!!  This offers a color version as well as the black and white version which is my favorite!!!\n",
      "I am sure we will love it.....as we seem to have lost, misplaced, lent out.......our previous copy. It arrived after Christmas so will not watch it until next year.\n",
      "This movie is a classical to watch. I got this as a gift for my Mom. For those who haven't seen it, I suggest that you do. You will like it.\n",
      "Everyone must watch this movie every year at Christmas time.  I enjoy it and this year I actually got family to watch it with me.  There are several versions of this classic but this one is the best.\n",
      "I was so excited when I discovered not only did the DVD have color version but it also had the black and white. Love the special features that are included as well.\n",
      "Miracle on 34th street is a treasure and a must have for every household as a Christmas Classic, I prefer the black and white version although there is a color version, I saw the first televised color version and it was not that good all the colors where hideous, But they have done some work on the video release and it is not that bad. So this make me feel young at heart and yes even shed a tear or too. This is definitely worthy of the description \"Christmas Classic.\" The storyline and wonderful performances by the tremendous cast create an enchanting tale. Although made in 1947, this film is in no way dated. It shows the commercial aspect that surrounds the holiday season while still managing to demonstrate the magical feeling that Christmas brings.I love its theme and its message: No matter what age you are, you must always be willing to have faith in others and yourself. This is the best way to own this old classic and any other classic for that matter!\n",
      "Purchased as a gift. A wonderful movie to watch in the Christmas season with hot cup of cocoa and fireplace going. The movie is very \"old school\" does not have flashy special effects or sex scenes that flood today's movies. This movie has substance and has survived history as a classic.\n",
      "Watch it every year. Weet watch it even when it's not Christmas. Sweet and funny. Always qioting lines from this movie .  How can you really go wrong with Christmas movie?\n",
      "Doesn't look as old as it is but still has all integrity of the original that this classic has to offer. Perfection. There's nothing better to have on while wrapping Christmas gifts. A seasonal must :)\n",
      "this is one of my all time favories. i loved the price. i could watch this movie over and over.\n",
      "I have loved this movie forever. It is just one that has to be watched every holiday season. Believing is what puts that magical feeling into your holidays.\n",
      "Love this classic Christmas movie.  I wasn't impressed with the remake and wanted my friend to see the original.  Nothing can beat this classic.\n",
      "One of the best Christmas movies ever made!  So glad to finally have it on DVD.  It came quickly.  This is a must have for any Christmas movie collection!\n",
      "This movie is a favorite tradition for Thanksgiving day after all the football and turkey.  Black and white or colored it is a great movie.\n",
      "Love this classic film, still amazes me how they \"colorize\" these old films. Natalie wood is  a peach of a young actress in this! Recommend this to anyone!!\n",
      "Always a great film to watch during the holidays.  Makes believers out of non-believers.  And these days, we need all the good news and perhaps miracles we can get.  Even if they're just on film!\n",
      "I have always loved this show. This is a really great Christmas movie, the new version is just as cool.\n",
      "Great movie, even after all these years.  Black and white or colorized, you can't go wrong.Edmund Gwenn as Santa is the heart and soul of this movie.  He is as we all imagine (and hope) Santa to be.  It almost hurts when we see the other characters not actually believing he is the one and only Saint Nick.But the other actors and actresses are also top notch...except for Maureen O'Hara.  She may be the nicest lady in the world ... I don't know ... but she almost single-handedly torpedoes this movie.  It achieves classic status despite her.John Payne plays the lawyer (Fred Gaily) and he is excellent ... a nice understated and believable performance.  And Natalie Wood is cute and believable as the little girl who doesn't believe in Santa Claus.  The rest of the cast is, as I said, superb (not counting Ms. O'Hara) ... giving us a collection of unique characters who fill out the movie nicely.One last thing ... the one scene I like (love) best is the one where the little Dutch girl, who can't speak English, comes to sit on Santa's lap.  A priceless, priceless moment.\n",
      "You just can't get any better than this version!  Every Christmas season this one has to be watched!!  Highly recommend this for your family tradition.\n",
      "Of all the Christmas movies, Miracle is still my favorite.  It looks terrific in Blue Ray.  Edmund Gwenn is terrific.\n",
      "a classic! I loved this as a little girl and still love it as a Mommy. I rented it here on Amazon to be able to show my kids (3 and 6) and even though it's not a fast-paced story and is in the original black and white, they both enjoyed it and asked to watch it again.\n",
      "This product contains both an original black and white and a colorized copy of the original Miracle on 34th Street.  Personally I feel that colorization is a major travistry but..  The black and white original is the cleanest, clearest copy of this classic that I have seen in years.  The original cast is so good that there have been several remakes all of which were a waste of time.  This is the definitive copy of a timeless story.\n",
      "This is the movie that will put the Christmas spirit in your heart.  We will watch it as conditioning prior toChristmas.\n",
      "I HAD to add this Movie to my Library. I enjoy this movie every time I see it.  I loved that this \"First\" Miracle on 34th Street is colorized. It was hard to make out some of the details in just Black & White. I love to see Natalie Wood as a Child and all the Actors are so believable. Watching this movie is a real tradition at Christmas Time for me. I think this Original Miracle on 34th Street is better than the \"re-make\" of the same story.\n",
      "I never tire of watching this movie every Christmas Season. Natalie Wood is sweet and smart. The other actors are believable.  A wonderful story which is not trying to be anything but good, wholesome entertainment.\n",
      "I love this movie and you need to watch the original in black and white!  The colorized version is not fit for human consumption.\n",
      "A Christmas classic .Have watched it since I was a child. Love all the actors and the wonderful message.Love it.\n",
      "I have watched this movie for years at Christmas time.  I think this brings out the child in all of us.\n",
      "What an enjoyable Christmas movie. By far the best of the all the versions of this movie.\n",
      "I have watching this movie every holiday time for over 20 years their have been remakes,butto me this one is the best and only one I would own\n",
      "There aren't many movies that can mix up a cute codger with a long white beard, an adorable little girl, a striving single mother, an evil embittered soul-shriveled ideologue, and a New York Christmas parade without causing most people over 6 to get a sugar high but this film does it and even manages to come across in spots as a serious drama.  Go figure.  If you haven't ever watched it - do.\n",
      "I had always heard that \"Miracle on 34th Street\" was a wonderful movie. Now, finally, after seeing it for the first time. I would agree.But beware: This is not timeless in the same way that \"It's a Wonderful Life\" is. The \"trial\" of Kris Kringle was bit outside of my ability to temporarily \"suspend disbelief\" to enjoy a good movie. Nevertheless, the movie is charming and a good way to spend an enjoyable evening during the holidays.\n",
      "Another Christmas movie I love to see every year! I'll never become tired of seeing these old time favorites! Its great to watch them, even in my old age!\n",
      "Of what possible interest could a review by some nobody (me, in this case) be for a movie that is one of the greatest classics in the history of moviemaking?I hardly think customer reviews are relevant in the case of movies in this category.\n",
      "Was there ever a better big-screen Santa than Oscar winner Edmund Gwenn? This timeless Christmas fable about an elderly retiree who sets New York a-twitter with his claim to be the sleigh-riding patron saint of the North Pole captures the spirit of the season like few other holiday films. Young Natalie Wood is delightful as the disbelieving girl who, hewing to her mother's urban sophisticate views, thinks the notion of elves and Saint Nick is preposterous. Repeat viewings won't diminish the charming allure or the endearing message of \"Miracle.\"\n",
      "What would Christmas be without this classic movie. It is a must see every year. Watch it with the family and enjoy Christmas!\n",
      "This classic movie is even better in color. I am very satisfied with this purchase, which was delivered as promised.\n",
      "Even though the cover is in color, this is the glorious B&W version that everyone should see. Natalie Wood is adorable, the supporting cast is great; and Edmund Gwynn is so perfect, the credits should say \"Kris Kringle as Himself\".\n",
      "Look forward to seeing this program every year. Could not find it on TV this year. A great story and Christmas tale and tradition.\n",
      "During the holiday seasons in New York, a old bearded man who claims to be Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn) is hired to be Macy's Santa Claus by worker Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) after proving to be impressive at the Macy's Thanksgiven Parade after the original guy to play Santa got drunk. Doris is just a skeptical woman who raising his daughter Susan (Natalie Wood) to believe in the truth even on Santa rather then fantasies until one day when Doris finds out that he claims to be the one and only Santa, she thinks he's nuts. But after he is determinated insane after a conflict with the store's psychologist, he is put on trial as everyone old and young alike must put their faith that he is the true Santa Claus for it would be a miracle.An amazing movie that has became a timeless and cherished christmas classic! Ever since it debuted in May of 1947, this movie has became one of the most beloved fantasy-comedy-drama movies ever thanks to it's original idea and strong message. Edmung Gwenn has earned an oscar for his role as Santa Claus as he's the true star of the movie besides O'Hara, the other performances including the young girl are all superb. This is a memorable movie about the meaning of christmas and what you should believe with your own heart as this is a feel good movie that will touch your every heart string.This 2-Disc DVD is superb! contains great picture and sound with both the original B&W; and new Colored versions. The extras are very good like audio commentary by Maureen O'Hara, Documentary \"AMC Backstory: Miracle on 34th Street\", A featurette on the history of the Macy's Thanksgiven Parade, Promotional Short that was made for theaters to promote the film, \"Fox Movietone News Footage: Hollywood Spotlight\", TV Version of the film and poster gallery.\n",
      "This Movie is great, always loved it and when raising my kids I used to play it on Thanksgiving morning for them keeping with the Parade by Macy's Department Store going on in the beginning of it. They came to love it as a Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Tradition and I just found out by way of the very same DVD purchased that a day is set aside for viewing the film in Ireland, very similar to the family tradition I had with my kids when growing up..I highly recommend this DVD set, one Original Black and White and one Colorized for anyone that dislikes black and white, not to mention the different added attractions and information added by interviews, inside information etc.I might add myself that the house used at the end of the film really exists on Long Island's North Shore on what I recall to be \"24 Derby Road\" Port Washington New York. That is in Nassau County North of Northern Boulevard not far from the Queens County/Nassau County border line.It is a nice neighborhood still to this day remains very much as it was then during the movie shoot and note in the DVD extras a lot of detail is added on neighbors and their interactions with the actors, actresses and crew making the movie.It arrived on time, in good condition was everything represented by the vendor and will forever remain a cherished part of my movie collection.\n",
      "Mom loved because it is the classic version and the true mircale on 34. Better than all the remakes that have been made.\n",
      "Now in Full Color ! . Miracle on 34th Street is an irrestible fable that has , for many years , become synnomymous with celebrating Christmas . And now this three-time Oscar winning tale is as colorful and respledent as the holiday itself in an all-new colorized version that's sure to delight fans old and new ! . The holiday seasons is in a full swing when a cultured gentleman with twinkling eyes, an ample belly , and a snowy beard (Edmund Gwenn 1877-1959) is hired as Macy's department store Santa . He Claims his name is Kris Kringle , and soon fills everyone with Chrismas spirit ... exept for his boss , Doris Walker ( Maureen O'Hara 1920- )  who's raising her daughter (Natalie Wood 1938-1981) to not belive in Santa . But when Kringle is declared insane , and put a trial , everyone's faith is put to the test as a young and old alike face the age-old question: Do you believe in Santa Claus . Super all-nes colorized version . High Quality transfer . Many funny feature a recommendation .\n",
      "Perfect Christmas classic.  I would watch it every year. Simple but it gets its point across.  Love the old classics!  Good for young kids too.\n",
      "Did not get the movie yet, but bad it on VCR and it wore out. Good decent family entertainment. Fun to watch this time of year!\n",
      "The original is so much better than the remake. Watch in b&w. The colorized version shown on TV doesn't look natural. If that is the only version available, use the TV settings to turn off the color. Sit back and enjoy. Sure the dialogue is a bit corny at times but the story will warm your heart on a cold winter's evening.\n",
      "Macy's Department Store hires a Santa Claus (Edmund Gwenn) for the toy department and he becomes quite a sensation with customers.  Unfortunately, they soon learn that the man, who goes by the name Kris Kringle, believes he is the actual Santa Claus.  This ends up leading to a commitment hearing where his lawyer, Fred Gailey (John Payne) must prove that Kris is exactly what he claims to be.Miracle on 34th Street is a lighthearted Christmas classic with a message that never goes out of style.  The movie is meant to remind all of us that Christmas is a time of giving and that the real meaning is too easily swamped by commercialism.  Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) and her daughter Susan (Natalie Wood) provide another aspect in that they are hardheaded pragmatists who don't believe in anything tangible.  Kris takes it as a personal challenge to bring a little magic and imagination into their lives.This is an interesting and entertaining movie for many reasons.  First, Santa Claus is often cited as an example of the commercialization of Christmas, but here he acts as its conscience.  Kris represents the best of humanity with his generosity, warmth, and kindness.  The movie may have gone a bit far in demonizing common sense but its heart is in the right place.  The performances are uniformly excellent and in a small role William Frawley (better known as Fred Mertz to Lucy fans) steals the show in all of his scenes.Miracle on 34th Street offers a bit of everything.  It's a comedy that's laugh out loud funny when it tries to be.  It's part schmaltzy Christmas movie and revels in that role, but just manages to avoid drowning in sappiness.  And it remains a very relevant fable about the excesses of modern society including being overly obsessed with materialism at the expense of intangibles that make live really worth living.  If you've never seen it, then give it a try and you just might find your new favorite holiday movie.\n",
      "This is the original Miracle on 34th St. It is in color. We just enjoyed it. I will pass this move down to our children.\n",
      "This movie is hands down an American classic. It must be the black and white version, and it must be this movie not any knock off that arrived later. All performances are excellent and what a holiday message the film bears!God bless Natalie Wood, Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, and especially Edmund Gwenn for leaving us this holiday treasure!\n",
      "The original \"Miracle on 34th Street\" is a splendid holiday classic that has audiences stunned. Lawyer John Payne works on a case to prove to everyone that Macy's Department Store Santa (Edmund Gwynn) is the one and only Santa Claus. This case reshapes the lives of Macy's employee Maureen O'Hara and daughter Natalie Wood. It is a truly magical and inspiring Christmas film that never ages which is perfect for future generations. MERRY CHRISTMAS!\n",
      "It is a fantastic movie & suitable for all ages... How many movies can u say that about now a days!\n",
      "I have loved it since I was a kid and watch it every year.  Movie is perfectly casted and wonderful for the family.\n",
      "mirachle on 34th .. great purchase!  i was very happy with this purchase and would recommend to any one interested in buying it.\n",
      "The classic version, as perfect as it could be. Lovely young Natalie Wood, stunning Maureen O'Hara and Edmond Gwenn is the perfect everyday Santa.\n",
      "What can I say, I love old movies.. As always it arrived in a timely man. We will enjoy for years to come, make the holidays just that much more special.\n",
      "I especially loved the commentary by Maureen O Hara.  I learned so much about this classic movie.  It was great!\n",
      "thanks for the tape.  i have loved this movie for along time.  it ani't christmas unless i get to what this movie.\n",
      "What a sweet, heartwarming story of faith & love - not just in Santa Claus but in each other as well.\n",
      "this is a joyful movie and one to watch every year with your best freind, then your children, then your grandchildren and hopefully your great grandchrildren\n",
      "Miracle on 34th StreetI watch this version every Christmas. I think its the best of all the versions made.\n",
      "Better than the newer versions. Loved that it was black and white or colorized. Great classic movie! The way movies should be today as well!!!\n",
      "It was so enjoyable seeing the original Miracle on 34th Street on such a high quality DVD.  Every Christmas I look forward to seeing this film, and it is difficult to find this version shown on TV.  The more recent versions of this film do not come close to the charm and cast that is found in the original film.  Did you know that this was Thelma Ritter's first movie?  She was middle aged when she acted in this movie.  She went on to act in a number of movies after this.  It just goes to show you that it is never too late to do something you really want to do.  Now that I have purchased the DVD, I can watch it any time I want to, even when it isn't during Christmas season.  I recommend buying this DVD from Amazon.com.  The price was great, the quality of the DVD is terrific and the shipping was speedy.  This is a timeless story that has lasted for years and will continue to last for many generations, and the original version is the best!\n",
      "Bought it for my sister who requested this one version, she did not like the newer versions, somehow, the whole story is not told the same way.\n",
      "The story line is so much better then the remake! It is warm, cheerful, and delightful, as befits the season. It is not cynical and fault find as is the later version\n",
      "This is a classic just like It's a Wonderful Life and should be watched by everyone every year-----great, great movie.\n",
      "I loved this movie! It became one of my favorite! The first important role for the little Natalie Wood. The second time I saw her in movie. Odd to think the first was in The Searchers, with John Wayne; this is a film with Maureen O'Hara. Curious, isn't it? Edmund Gwenn won an Academy Award for his performance in this movie. And I'm glad because he made you really believe that he's Santa Claus! A must see in Christmas time.\n",
      "I was so glad that this selection has the original black & white version on it. It allows you to see the original black & white or has it in color. I got the updated DVD a few years ago & was disappointed that it was not the same as I remembered it.\n",
      "This is one of the top shows to watch every year near Christmas time along with White Christmas, It's a Wonderful Life, A Christmas Story, Christmas Vacation, and Home Alone.  There are many others, but I think that these are at the top of the list.\n",
      "Miracle on 34th Street is a festive, hart warming story. It truly shows the true meaning of Christmas! \"Believing in something when common sense tells you not to.\"\n",
      "How well this movie holds up! and what a story for our times. Edmund Gwenn's Oscar-winning performance as Kris Kringle is sharp and funny without ever becoming sentimental. Natalie Wood's natural and charming Susan gets to show the all-too-modern skepticism about something as \"corny\" as the spirit of Christmas. Maureen O'Hara, Susan's mom, gets to deliver a Scrooge-like speech about the foolishness of her lawyer boyfriend's decision to defend Kringle's right to be Santa. His heart-felt desire to defend Kringle's message and delivery of charity, love, and joy seem to Susan's mom to be career suicide for the young lawyer. Guess who wins that battle? I hadn't see this movie in thirty years and was delighted with the snappy direction, clear characterizations, and modern message. Wonderful film.\n",
      "I definitely needed to own my own copy.  I like to watch it whenever I need a Christmas pick-me-up. Enjoy!\n",
      "Great classic movie to view every Christmas. They don't make them like this anymore! A great addition to your holiday collection.\n",
      "This is a Christmas tradition in our house, no matter when it was made or who stars in it.  I believe!\n",
      "This is my favorite movie to watch at Christmas time. It has been a tradition to watch this movie with my family at the holidays. I just love it. I can't wait to be a grandma, so I can start the tradition with my grandkids.\n",
      "I love this movie and hope all have an opportunity to see it !!!  Miracle on 34th Street (1947) conveys the true spirit of Christmas !!  This movie touches my heart every time I see it !!\n",
      "it's simply one of the most charming and funny christmas movies of all time. she's a weak actor and he's just okay, but little natalie wood is perfect, and edmund glenn could make me believe in santa!\n",
      "This edition is a lovely colorized verion of the original 1947 movie with heartwarming performances by Natalie Wood, Edmund Gwenn (as Santa Claus), Maureen O'Hara, and John Payne. There are fine character performances by the supporting cast, which includes William Frawley from \"I Love Lucy.\" The trial of Santa Claus has touches of humor and \"flawless\" legal logic which brings the movie to a fun and uplifting ending. No other version of this film has quite the same charm as the original. A great film for children and adults alike to get everyone into the Christmas spirit!\n",
      "My very favorite seen is when they find the cane in the corner of the room in the house she asked for from Santa.\\Innocense is something that is missing inall the new Christmas movies and or many others.\n",

      "I bought this for my Mom.  I'm sure it's still a great movie.  I haven't watched it in years.  My Mom loves this movie.\n",
      "It is a classic for me and I enjoyed the extras that came with the movie such as the commentary\n",

      "I prefer this original movie over the remake.  I would watch it every Christmas season with my Mother and Father when it was shown on TV.  Now I can watch it whenever I want.  Edmund Gwenn, Maureen O'Hara and Natalie Wood are excellent.\n",
      "This is one of the all time great Christmas movies. We make a point to watch it every year. This version is awesome because it has the original black & white as well as the colorized version (which I have never seen).  It is a wonderful movie for all ages & one you can watch every year.\n",
      "Color or black & white, this is a amazing movie. Any other remakes are pale in comparison, not even worth the time to watch. I'll stick with the original, thank you.\n",
      "I have another version of this movie in LD.  I like the story very much and its idea of using the Post Office to prove officially the existence of the Santa is so much better than the 1994 remake.  This edition provides the best of both world (Colour and B/W)for me as well.  All in all, it is a great value package for a young at heart.\n",
      "My boyfriend's been looking for a B&W copy of this in DVD format - and this has both! A nice surprise!\n",
      "Ordered this last minute because it was not available on Netflix.Prime shipped super fast and we were able to watch before Christmas.....made the wife very happy.Good flic.\n",

      "This movie has always been a Christmas favorite! The colorized version is fantastic!  The price was right and was delived very quickly!\n",
      "Although I didn't read closely enough to realize that this was the black & white version, I've been enjoying the original format.  Received delivery very quickly.\n",
      "What more can I say?  It's \"Miracle on 34th Street\" and, if you've seen it, you know.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  There are other versions, but I think this is the best.\n",
      "I could not fault this movie A++++++++++++++++++++++++Edmond Gwen was and is the real Santa\n",
      "Having a mother that's in love with movies from the 30s, 40s and 50s, also living in a home where we enjoy Christmas movies all year round, I grew up with this film.If you haven't seen this film, in short it deals with the commercialization of Christmas and with that what we tend to lose; which is even more true today. This movie is cute, charming and has an young adorable Natalie Wood(Maria from \"West Side Story\") in it.Great film for all ages!\n",
      "Very pleased with the quality of the video.  Preferred this B/W version.  It also arrived quickly.\n",
      "The innocence of these movies have true meanings to be shared. Love this movie year after year as does my 20 year old granddaughter\n",
      "This is a timeless classic with superb performances and a terrific storyline. Natalie Wood is priceless!!  This should be in every Christmas movie lover's collection.\n",
      "Of all the versions of this movie that have come out, this is the very best.  I could watch this movie every Christmas season.\n",
      "I've loved this movie for years and it's a must-see every Christmas.  I had it on VHS (I know that dates me lol) and finally decided to upgrade to DVD.\n",
      "I have never really been a huge fan of black and white movies- but Miracle on 34th Street is one of those few excepetions. Remarkably written and casted this a true Christmas classic that will stay long in your heart after you watch it.The children will enjoy seeing the story and parents will enjoy a well-written story. The actors in the movie give out of this world performances that made them go on to be greats in hollywood history.Staying true to the classic story the movie does not stray from the well-written book. It is one of those movies that make you get into the holiday spirit. It makes you feel a little bit cheerier. It makes adults into believers and kids into true believers. This is definately a movie to own... and be enjoyed around the holidays!\n",
      "I'll admit it, I'm a complete and total Christmas fanatic and so find very little to complain about, when it comes to classic Christmas films.  Miracle On 34th Street (1947) is an absolute favorite of mine.  I don't think any film captures the innocence of the Christmas season, like this film does.What a cast....Edmund Gwenn, Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Natalie Wood, Gene Lockhart, Thelma Ritter and William Frawley, just to name a few.  Gwenn won an Academy Award for his role as, Kris Kringle and he deserved it!If I was going to show one film to someone not fond of Christmas films, this would probably be the one I'd choose, betting I could make a fan of them with one viewing of this classic.I've bought the VHS, the DVD and the Blu-Ray of this film and have never been disappointed.  I even appreciate the colorized version of the film and that's rare for me.Gather the family and introduce a whole new generation to this classic....I bet it won't be the only time you watch this!\n",
      "This film was always part of my family's holiday preparation. Being New Yorkers made it even better. The arrival of Santa at the end of the Macy's parade always brought tears to my eyes. It still does. I am trying to make it a tradition for my grandsons. I love this film, black and white or colorized. My youngest grandson, 8 years old, asked why we were going to watch a gray movie. I explained that color film was not invented when this film was made. The movie started and not one of the three boys got up to even get a drink of water. They love it just like I do.\n",
      "Still one of Christmas's best movies.  A feel good movie that every family should watch over the holidays. This one will never go out of style.\n",
      "This is a classic and one of our family favorites, Now we are ready for our christmas family movie nights for many years to come.\n",
      "This movie is one of the classics, an all time Christmas favorite. We watch it every year at Christmas time.\n",
      "A lovely heartwarming Christmas movie.  How can you not love this movie?  I have this put away and a week before Christmas I pull it out and watch it to get into the spirit of Christmas.\n",
      "Was a gift,they were thrilled to receive it. They appreciate the classic Christmas movies and will pass it to their son.\n",
      "My Blu-ray DVD of Miracle on 34th St. arrived quickly and in NEW condition just as I had ordered it!\n",
      "Great movie, fast shipping from Amazon, we are very pleased with our purchase.This movie is a classic. If you haven't seen it, buy it. If you have, buy it.This is one of those \"Watch every season\" kinda movies.You'll like it. I promise!\n",
      "This movie was very fun and great to watch for the holidays.  Our family will be watching it as a traditon each christmas eve\n",
      "Love this movie! So glad that it was available for purchase!!!! Thanks for providing these great old movies for the generations to come!!!!\n",
      "tHIS IS A KEEPER.  i LOVE THE CLASSIC`S DURING THE HOLIDAYS AND THIS ONE WILL BE IN MY COLLECTION FOR YEARS TO COME.  GREAT SERVICE BY AMAZON IN GETTING IT TO ME.  THANK YOU AMAZON\n",
      "I just love this movie! It is such a memory for me. I made my kids watch it every year with me while they were growing up!\n",
      "this old classic is sure to bring back many memories.  Even the grandchildren who thought we were a bit \"square\" found delight is this timeless story.  Thanks for a package that arrived in a timely fashion, was well packed, and in great condition\n",
      "This is one our my favorite movies, had a black & white VCR version of it so we got this colorized DVD for our daughter for Xmas. It is wonderful!  I did not think I would like the colorized version of this classic, some things are better left the way they were, but I was wrong!  The color is great, especially the parade scenes, and what a nice treat to see how things really looked when they were making the movie instead of just in black and white!  Highly recommend this to all fans of this movie, you won't be disappointed!!\n",
      "We buy few DVD's these days as we can stream just about everything but I wanted to give this to my adult daughter for Christmas. Totally worth it. I remember watching it as a child in the 70s and she, a child of the 90s, loved it as much as I did.\n",
      "A true holiday classic along with \"It's a Wonderful Life\".  Watch the original black and white version.  The colorized version is odd looking.\n",
      "Excellent picture and sound quality.  Speedy shipping.  Highly recommend seller.\n",
      "Yes, little Susan, there is a Santa Claus . . . and in this movie he's pretending to be the actor Edmund Gwenn just so he can bring a little Christmas joy to the world.Made in the rosy flush of victory after World War II, MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET is a wonderfully optimistic film. Santa's kindliness to a little Dutch refugee girl tugs at the heartstrings. And that is only one of many scenes.Maureen O'Hara (Doris) a divorced single Mom, is coordinator of the venerable Macy*s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Forced to find a last-minute replacement for a snockered St. Nick she hires the real Santa Claus. Of course, nobody really believes that he's the one and only Kris Kringle, but he does, and what's more important, by the end of the movie, so do we.Mr. Kringle has to suffer through the indignity of a committment hearing (which he wins in an \"it-could-only-happen-in-New York City\" manner), but his greatest victory is convincing the cynical Doris and her disbelieving six year old (played by Natalie Wood) that imagination is just another form of reality.This Special Edition has three versions of the film. The original b&w; 1947 version and the colorized 1980 version are packaged with a 1950's edited-for-TV version (which somehow I remember seeing in the early 1960s). Thank heavens it DOES NOT have the more recent remake.No matter what version you decide to watch (I recommend the 1947 original), nothing outshines this happy film.\n",
      "This is a wonderful Christmas movie. If you love old movies this is a perfect one to get.\n",
      "This movie is a true American tale. Although the Department Store originated in Europe, American cities, in their heyday, took it to a whole new level. In an era long before Malls, shoppers whether they lived in city, suburb, or country, would travel to their nearest downtown to do their shopping at one of these grand emporiums. It did not matter whether it was Detroit (JL Hudson), Philadelphia (John Wanamaker), Boston (Jordan Marsh), Chicago (Marshal Feild), every city had it's signature store and it was as much an issue of civic pride as the baseball team was. When this movie was released (1947), Manhattan was to home to over one dozen grand department stores.Even small cities had the \"it\" store such as; Hess's in Allentown, Bergner's in Peoria, Pourteous in Portland, and so on.Needless to say these icons really shined at Christmas, and this movie took it's inspiration from two of the most competitive of NYC's grand stores, Gimbels (closed since 1986), and still thriving Macy's. Macy's holds it's famous Thanksgiving Day Parade in NYC (Gimbels was in Philly), and after the original Macy's Santa was found to be celebrating a wee bit too much, Edmund Gwenn steps onto the scene as THE Kris Kringle.Maureen O'Hara plays the haried Macy's Personel Manager (it was not called \"HR\" yet), and she is found to be a bitter divorcee, and single parent (yes, even then people got divorced, and were single parents).  John Payne courts her, and I guess you could say wants to rescue her, and Natalie Wood from their very insular world.However in the middle of all this Macy's Santa winds up sending parents to,  horrors, of horrors,  Gimbels for better skates (and other toys), and for that matter any other store if Macy's does not have it better, or cheaper.  Needless to say Macy's Toy Buyer freaks out big time, and Santa winds up in a court battle over his sanity.It all works out in the end, and if ever there is a time for a good old fashioned Hollywood ending it's Christmas time.A true American tale that can't make you feel anything, but good!\n",
      "This is a classic, wonderful Christmas movie!  A must have for your Christmas movie collection.  And I got it for a great deal!\n",
      "You can't go wrong with this one. Such a cute tale and instantly makes the whole house feel extra Christmas-ee!\n",
      "I grew up watching this movie and now I get to share it with my daughter.  It's s great classic flick. Love it!\n",
      "I love this movie.  So sweet and touching, a movie that makes me feel good any time of the year.\n",
      "I was pleasantly surprised at the improved quality of the Blu Ray edition of Miracle on 34th Street.  Glad I bought this one.\n",
      "This is one of the best Christmas movies out of the past, and I enjoy watching it with my family every year.  Happy with purchase.\n",
      "Great Christmas Classic themes including love, family, belief in one another, commercialism, and Santa.  A feel good movie without the slap stick or crassness of modern Christmas movies.\n",
      "I chose this DVD because of the timelessness of the story during the advent season.  Even though it was made in 1947 its message is still valid today.\n",
      "I keep it in a box w/Christmas music and decorations.  It used to be broadcast every year on TV Thanksgiving weekend but it tends to be the colorized version which I don't care for.\n",
      "This is a Classic movie, the very best of all the Miracle on 34th St movies. Love all the actors, perfect casting.\n",
      "One of the many joys of the season. Do you believe in santa? A tiny Natalie Wood Natalie Wood learns to believe in Santa and so does her Mom, Maurene O'Hara. a wonderful movie for the entire family.\n",
      "Miracle on 34th Street is an excellent movie for the family. It certainly put you into the Holiday Spirit! It is also a good example for belief in other people and standing up for right principles.  I recommend it highly!!\n",
      "Since \"Miracle on 34th Street\" begins with the Macy's parade on Thanksgiving Day, it is the obvious movie to watch on Turkey Day to begin the Christmas season (when you watch \"White Christmas,\" \"A Christmas Carol,\" and \"It's a Wonderful Life\" is up to you). I know am not alone in my belief that Edmund Gwenn IS Kris Kringle, which means he IS Santa Claus. Of course they gave Gwenn the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in 1948, but the film also won Oscars for Best Writing, Original Story (Valentine Davies) and Best Writing, Screenplay (George Seaton). Maureen O'Hara plays Doris Walker, a single mom who insists on bringing her daughter Susan, played by adorable Natalie Wood in one of the great childhood performances of all time, in a no-nonsense manner, which means no fantasy, no fairy tales and certainly no Santa Claus. Boy, is she ever wrong.This version of this classic holiday film offers up the long trailer in which the publicity department tries to figure out how to market the film to the masses.  A nice added bonus.  However, the point of owning \"Miracle on 34th Street\" is to be able to watch it when it fits our holiday schedule and cry over our favorites scenes.  The best times to cry during this movie are as follows: (1) When Susan overhears Kris talking Dutch to the little refugee girl; (2) When Mr. Macy admits under oath on the witness stand that he believes Kris to be Santa Claus; (3) When Susan writes \"I believe in you too\" on Susan's letter to Kris; (4) When Susan yells, \"Stop, Uncle Fred! Stop!\" and (5) when Fred sees the cane in the corner. Please feel free to add others to this list as you see fit. Now, excuse me, as I have to go dry my eyes and remember that some films have become holiday classics for good reasons and that remaking something in color does not mean just because it is new it is improved. Happy Turkey Day, everyone!\n",
      "This is a perfect Christmas movie to watch with the family. My kids will set and watch the whole movie, even the black and white version. I love it and highly recommend it to anyone who hasnt seen it before! It will become an instant family favorite.\n",
      "This is a great investment! Although I would have enjoyed seeing the color version in HD just as well as the B&W it was well worth my money and the video quality is outstanding, along with the 5.1 DTS-HD MA.\n",
      "I bought this one for the fact that it has both black & white and colorized. I expect it this week. The excellence of the movie was not in question. This is a classic for the ages. The casting is superb, the story is heart-warming, the acting is engaging. See it if you haven't. Not the remake, though (doesn't hold a candle).\n",
      "It is a miracle that this is in COLOR again!  What a heart warming story.  A must see every Christmas time.\n",
      "Love this movie. There is nothing better that a classic Christmas movie anytime of the year. Will watch over and over.\n",
      "After seeing many remakes of this wonderful classic, I can honestly say \"the first is always the best!\" Can never watch this one enough. I believe, I believe, I know it's silly, but I believe.\n",
      "This is one of the greatest Christmas stories.  Entertaining and heart warming !  I watch it every year and when I found it was no longer shown on a station I get, I had to have my own copy !\n",
      "Wonderful Christmas Classic for those young at heart!  What's there not to love about Natalie Wood!  One of her early favorites.  You and your little one's will enjoy this family classic.\n",
      "Lovely story line and message. For those of us who cherish the warmth and happiness of the spirit and still Believe...\n",
      "This is one of the all-time favorite holiday classics and I'm delighted I could purchase it on Amazon Instant Video.\n",
      "I do not like the more recent version of this film.  This version with Edmund Gwenn is the only one worth watching.  So many award-winning actors!  Such a delightful  timeless, story!\n",
      "Great movie got it fast!  Got it as an addition to the orginal one.Just like this movie alot.  Colored version just not as good.\n",
      "I have every video of this movie made--VHS & CD!--and love them all! This is, by far, the BEST made EVER! Even though I own (too) many copies, I STILL watch the TV version whenever it's on! I've seen the \"re-makes\", but they just don't measure up to the original! (I'll never watch a re-make again! Edmund Gwenn is the ONLY Santa there can ever be!) Forget \"colorized\" versions! When a movie is made in B & W, the director makes CHOICES about the filming--you cannot \"improve\" upon perfection! This movie IS perfection! Don't hesitate in buying a copy--you will NEVER regret it and your children will ALWAYS remember the one, true Santa! The REAL Santa is totally approachable, as is (was!) Mr. Gwenn! Get every copy in the original B & W that you can find! No \"colorized\", no re-makes. Those waste your money. Stick with the original--ALWAYS!!!\n",
      "This movie is a great Christmas family movie. It is a classic that I can watch over and over again.\n",
      "A Christmas tradition - it should be manditory viewing every year for every person.  Perfect performances - this could never be remade as well as the original!  Natalie Wood is perfect as is Maureen O'Hara.\n",
      "For all Christmas lover's this Movie is a must-have for your collection.  This movie is enjoyable and will be loved by your whole family!\n",
      "There is nothing like watching this movie while decorating the tree, then Christmas Eve and again Christmas DayThe original is the only one to see!\n",
      "What can I say. The movie speaks for itself!  It will become part of our holiday traditions from now on.\n",
      "Truly a classic. One of the only black and white movies I have watched over and over. If you have never seen this movie, you must see it right away.\n",
      "I have loved this movie since I was a child.  Now I have it on DVD and never get tired of seeing it.  I have put it in with my students Christmas movies.  Wonderful movie!  In fact, I have bought both versions on this movie!\n",
      "This is a classic you MUST own! About an hour or so after the current year's Macy's Thanksgiving parade is over, you pop this in, and the Christmas season is officially underway! I love this movie.\n",
      "Because it's a movie the whole family can watch that shows the true meaning of Christmas. Merry Christmas and happy New Years\n",
      "You can't go wrong with this great Christmas Classic.  I wouldn't even want to watch any remakes; no one can top Natalie Wood, Edmund Gwen, John Payne, and Maureen O'Hara.  I think Natalie Wood was one of the great child actors, and I always cry at the end of the movie.  Seeing New York in the 40s with Macy's and Gimble's in competition just makes me wish I lived back then.\n",
      "Really enjoyed the movie when I was a kid and wanted to watch it for the holidays while I sew.\n",
      "The original version is the best.  The remake is cute....but a lot of the bests parts come from it taking place in the 50's.  I have watched the original and then the remake and keep going back to the remake time and time again.  Maureen O'Hara is magnificent in this movie!!\n",
      "EXCELLENT MOVIE, 3 DIFFERT VERSIONS. DEFINETLY WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION. A MUST HAVE\n",
      "I saw both versions of this film and igot to say this is the best one.its in black and white but the acting and the story is just as good forour times as it was back in1949  its about faith.beleiving in something,that things will get better how can i make it better,good will to your fellow man,joy at their happyness.it may sound corny to somebut if there were more of this there would be less of the violence we have had lately.this movie is a feel good movie no one gets killed but all get lifted up in spirit it also has a colerized version that comes with free of charge.\n",
      "Was?  Should be?You can't make so many \"knock-offs\" without the original being wonderful.  Not to mention \"herself\" and...the adorable young Natalie!\n",
      "Watched the color version by mistake.  Will watch the classic black and white next Christmas;  Great movie to add to my collection.\n",
      "Love the cast.  How can you go wrong with O'Hara, Wood, Payne and Gwenn as Santa. This has always been a favorite of mine as a child and now I am bringing my kids up with it.  It is our Thanksgiving Day Holiday Movie.  After the parade and before the football my family has to give up control of the remote for this classic.\n",
      "I've loved this movie for years and years as most people do.  I purchased this copy for a friend whose video has finally given out.  They will love all the versions on this set.\n",
      "this colection has lots ofstuff, ter is the movie in black and white and color, the original teaser,and a tv vesion which stunk,therewa a cometary,thy say there ar 2 commentarys, but its only one\n",
      "I Gifted this item in a creative \"movie night\" theater basket for Christmas, as a family gift.  They loved it, as the father, my nephew watched this years ago every holiday with his own, now passed, mother.  He enjoyed sharing it with his own children.\n",
      "The newer colorization process applied to this superb story will add emensely to your collection of Holiday stories. Edmund Gween, should be reintroduced to whole generations who have never seen the work of this superb actor, ditto for actress  Maureen O'Hara\n",
      "Everybody has to love this adorable movie about the little girl who leans to believe in Santa Claus.  It's one of my Christmas favorites and even better in color!\n",
      "A must see every Christmas season. I especially like watching it in the original version. Recommend for people of all ages.\n",
      "I look for this version of Miracle on 34th Street (along with White Christmas) every season & didn't find it this year so decided not to miss it again by buying the blu-ray version so I don't have to miss it every again. Really a wonderful memory of Christmas when I was young!\n",
      "Had this movie in black & white on VHS ever since it came out and enyoyed it every year. This year, i figured I give the colorized version on DVD a try and I was very surprised how great it showed up on my wide screen TV. As I do have a vision problem due to macula degeneration and can not see everything as clearly as I used to, I was worried that the colors would look more blurry since it's been remade and colorized but this was not the case. I could see the picture as well as any other original color movie or TV in general. I own many Christmas movies, from the old black & white Christmas in Connecticut to the Rankin/Bass animated stories and Tim Allen's Santa Clause 1 - 3. I enjoy them all once a year comes December but Miracle on 34th Street is still my all-time favorite. Edmund Gwenn made the perfect Santa and the rest of the cast played their  parts beautifully. I have been a Maureen O'Hara fan since way back so it's always wonderful to see her again in this charming story. I don't think I have to go into detail about the story itself - many reviews have been left already. Just want to say that this old movie always adds to my spirit for the holdidays!\n",
      "This is One of the biggest christmas classics of all time.. It's a christmas tradtion in my house to sit and watch this movie with the family.. Who can forget Mr. Shellhammertell Mrs. Walker \"He's a born Salesman...I can Feel it!!!!\" I know it's a little goofy but Nothing better then Christmas time a couple of drinks and making fun of some of the lines in the movie... Buy this movie and have a Merry Christmas...P.S. Don't buy the cheap remakes of this Christmas Classic..America makes to many remakes as it is..\n",
      "As far as I am concerned, Edmund Gwen is the only one that pulled this off so successfully.  We as a family used to watch this movie every Christmas day for years on telly.  Now I have my own copy and once again we as a family watched it on Christmas night\n",
      "Christmas movies don't get any better than this.  Great plot with a twist.  The ending is so satisfying.  It's the perfect blend of reality and fantasy.\n",
      "I am very happy I bought this movie. It is a classic. The color makes it even better.I love old movie make overs.\n",

      "This has to be the most heartwarming movie. Much better than the remake. I'd recommend it anytime to any age persons.\n",
      "This movie is definitely up there at the top of my 'Christmas movies to watch every year or every other year' list!  It is a wonderful movie for everyone in the entire family - even the men!  It is heartwarming too, but not overly cheesy for a movie with Santa Claus in it! :)\n",
      "Love, love, love this movie. Always a great movie to watch at Christmas time. We just saw the play in a local theater and I just had to have the movie.\n",
      "I especially like the fact that you receive one disk in black and white as the director made it, and one in color, which brightens it up a bit! It is my favorite holiday film!!\n",
      "It's always been my second favorite movie, first being It's a Wonderful Life. I would recommend it to anyone who needs to get into the Christmas spirit.\n",
      "My wife and I met in NYC and lived there for many years. While we never joined the Herald Square crowds at 34th & B'way to watch the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, we always went down to Columbus Ave and West 77th to watch them inflate the balloons the evening before, right outside the Natural History Museum. The next day, we'd watch the parade from Central Park West, right near The Dakota (72nd Street) where much of this particular film is set.Because of that, \"Miracle On 34th Street\" holds pride of place with our family as the first Xmas movie we watch every year from our now-always-temperate digs in SoCal - we watch the Macy's Parade on TV (well, at least until the insipid TV hosts send us screaming) and then segue neatly to the film, whose opening scenes are set at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.Personally, I still like the film a lot, even though its theme of \"all you have to do is believe and things come true\" is a bit juvenile...and even after realizing that the whole premise that gets the case against \"Santa\" dismissed is based on the fact that the USPS apparently breaks the law - the very law that had just been read in open court by defense lawyer Fred Gaily only moments before - when they \"illegally\" deliver all of those \"Dear Santa\" letters to the court in which Kris sits as the defendant. I guess one isn't supposed to notice such things when a feel-good story is reaching its climax.The BD comes up very well in its new transfer. Be advised that the BD does NOT contain the colorized version of this film that seems to be so popular. For that, you need to purchase the 2-disc DVD set that was released in 2006. That set gives you a number of extra features that aren't on this single BD as well, including the TV version of the story that was aired on December 14, 1955, and that features Thomas Mitchell (aka Uncle Billy in \"It's A Wonderful Life\") as Kris Kringle, with Teresa Wright as Doris and Macdonald Carey as Fred. This 46-minute version was produced for the \"20th-Century Fox Hour.\"Considering the fact that the 1947 Miracle has been an evergreen pretty much since its original theatrical release, one wonders why in the world it has been subjected to numerous updated versions, none of them particularly successful, despite featuring casts that at the time were considered to be quite capable. In addition to the 1955 version that appears on the DVD set mentioned above, these include a 1959 60-minute color TV version starring Ed Wynn as Kris (with Orson Bean as Dr Sawyer and Mary Healy as Doris), a perfectly awful 100 minute TV version from 1973 featuring Sebastian Cabot as Kris, Jane Alexander as Karen (aka Doris) and David Hartman as Fred, and - most recently - an overblown and irritating full-length film \"remake\" from 1994, featuring Richard Attenborough as Kris with the insufferable Mara Wilson as Doris' daughter, Susan.None of them comes close to the freshness and vitality of the 1947 original, so why did they bother?Stick with the original, and in the original B&W; on BD, if you please.Recommended.\n",
      "This show is great for the whole family, warm story, and has lots of laughs. The Actors for the movie seem to just make the show!\n",
      "Much needed, a belief in something magical. A must see for all ages and generations. Perhaps seeing this movie together with your whole family.\n",
      "What a great classic Christmas movie. I was born during the era when this movie was released and I have enjoyed it every year throughout my lifetime. Christmas is not Christmas without the original version of \"Miracle on 34th Street.\"\n",
      "A GREAT STORY TO BE SEEN AT CHRISTMAS TIME THAT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL NICE ALL OVER AT ANY AGE.\n",
      "I give this classical movie 5 stars because I hear it's excellent.  I haven't seen it yet as my copy is promised to arrive this Friday.  My son couldn't believe I haven't ever seen it.  He watches it every year at this time of year and rates it highly so that's why I decided to purchase my own copy.\n",
      "Because it is a touching feeling and want to make u feel amazing and exciting! Make you feel alive! Awesome!\n",
      "Miracle on 34th Street is a true classic and a must see each Christmas/Holiday Season.With that said my review will concentrate on the technical issues related to this release rather than the film itself so you can help decide if it is is worth your hard earned cash to upgrade from your current copy, be it VHS or DVD.Miracle on 34th Street comes to you on a BD25 disc with DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 sound (the original Mono is an option for you purists out there) and a small but pleasing amount of extra features. Mine came in an eco case with no slipcover but has nice color printing on both the cover itself and the disc.How does the picture quality on this Blu ray disc compare to the most recent DVD release?  Simply put, it is a noticeable improvement but won't win any transfer of the year awards.  There are NO 'issues' with the transfer other than it being from less than an ideal source. I can not bring myself to believe this was taken from a camera negative, but rather from a previous scan done at a less than ideal resolution.  Don't get me wrong, it looks GREAT and at time shows much fine detail and even depth from time to time.  It just isn't reaching the heights of 'Casablanca' or 'The Maltese Falcon' to name few older B&W; Blu ray titles I own.  I have learned over the last few years that the sharpness of the image has very little to do with the age of the film, but rather the condition of the source used for the scan and whether or not that source was the original negative or 2nd or 3rd generation COPY of that negative.  I have films from the 30's that are razor sharp but they came from a full restored original negative and it shows.The picture is clear and free of almost any print damage. A detected a small amount of telecine wobble but only a few short times and most people probably won't notice it. Both edge enhancement and perceptible DNR has been avoided.  I actually achieved the best visual rendering with a VERY small amount of DNR applied from my Qdeo processor that is built into my Oppo BDP-93 Blu Ra player. Most HDTV's have \"Digital Noise Reduction\" available in their menus and I respectfully suggest a  very small application of it will improve this particular rendering. I am of course splitting hairs here and being way too picky for my own good! Overall, the picture is quite good and a shock to anyone who has only seen this movie on SD TV channels or VHS over the years. It is still a marked improvement over the best DVD as well.The uptick in sound quality is where this Blu Ray truly shines!  There is a nice spacious atmospheric effect created by making use of all 5 channels in this very nice DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 surround mix.  This is NOT an effects movie and as such you may not even notice how all 5 channels are used, but it does add a lovely open sound, crowds are all around you in Macy's and even the elevator sound is more realistic.  People coming in and going out doorways now do so in beautiful stereo. When someone walks across screen their voices pan left or right nicely. Most dialogue is firmly seated in the center channel where it belongs but it is nice to have stereo sound effects, voices and at times music with the added ambiance and depth created by the usage of the rear channels. Not much low frequency info on this title so your sub won't be getting much use, although from time to time the lower notes in the score will be reproduced very nicely through it.The Special features are short and sweet but varied and really compliment the movie. I watched all of them after the feature and never got bored or wanted to FF to the next feature.  It is hard to imagine back in 1947 that this movie would have been described as \"Groovy\" but it WAS and in the films actual trailer too!  (I didn't even know teenagers USED the word \"Groovy\" in the 40's but the proof is right there in the short promo film made by 20th Century Fox back then)  You get two documentaries, a studio promo film , some snippets from the Oscars where Edmund Gwenn wins Best Supporting actor and more. It is a nicely rounded set of extras. You also get a VERY cool movie commentary from Maureen O' Hara , one of the films stars.  As of this writing she is still alive at 91 and has been involved with promotional fan gatherings at Macy's over the years, most recently in the early 2000's.All in all, this is a great Blu Ray presentation that won't disappoint and will continue to provide great entertainment value year after year!  HIGHLY recommended!\n",
      "I first saw Miracle on 34th Street with Sabastian Cabot as Santa in the early 70's. But after seeing the original version, well it can't be beat. The facial expressions from Natalie Wood are 'priceless'!!!\n",
      "This is a classic film with a great cast, the likes ofwhich we will never see again. This version is far betterin every way than any of the cheesy, poorly cast remakes.If you want to see a great film like this one, stick tothe original and skip the poorly done, politically correctremakes.\n",
      "I love this movie. I did not like the remake done in the 1980's.  Love the original especially in color.\n",
      "Now, really! Christmas isn't all Christmas should be without watching one's favorite Christmas movies. Bonus! Maureen O'Hara in lead role!\n",
      "I was looking for this video and could not find it locally and while surfing the web, I found it online. I will recommend your company to others without hesitation. Thanks.\n",
      "My friend wanted the miracle on 34th st. with Natalie Wood!  I hope she likes it, it's her favorite Christmas movie\n",
      "Every time I watch this classic, it renews my faith in humanity and reminds me how important it is to believe.Great \"feel good\" movie.\n",
      "This is my favorite version of the classic Christmas story, Natalie Wood is great, cute as a little girl and very believable!\n",
      "A Christmas classic - Natalie Wood and Maureen O'Hara are great as the mother/daughter in this with a great supporting cast.\n",
      "This came promptly.  The cover shows color.  It is black and white which is fine and reflects the period of time.\n",
      "This was a gift for my daughter who is a very big fan of any Christmas movie especially one with memories\n",
      "I like this movie because it is a cute story. I remember it from when I was a child and I always looked forward to seeing it.\n",
      "This movie has been around for years. You can watch this movie anytime of the year. Brings back memories of believing in Santa. What Christmas is suppose to represent. I highly recommend this movie to all ages. I had this in vhs so I decided to get it in a dvd. It's one of my favorites\n",
      "I love the last line of this great movie.  If you've never seen it, I won't give it away...but somehow it reminds me of the last line of Some Like It Hot (I won't give away that line either.)It's hard to believe that the beautiful little girl is Natalie Wood.  And Ed Gynn make the perfect Santa Claus.I like the original better than the re-make.This is a charming movie that is great for the whole fmaily.Also recommended:Christmas in Connecticut--a great Christmas movie in the screwball comedy tradition.Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices--a touching look at the miracle of giving.\n",
      "Movie is one of my favorites and was disappointing when the VHS player tried to eat it. So next year I have it on DVD both colored in and the original B/W\n",
      "Miracle on 34th Street this is the only one i ever seen --or perhaps fully seen--- a new modern version i never seen so  i cant compare... between the two--- know  that there isnt any magic  its all simple  but  a good story-- and the only movie that has ever shown me the macy's thanksgiving  parade i think it was thanksgiving-- i havnt re looked at the movie in awile.\n",
      "This original version is wonderful!! True to the time period and the story.  Love the Santa in this movie.  He keeps you believing!\n",
      "Always one of those must see movies during the Christmas season. Superb acting from an all star cast and the DVD offers the purity of classic Black and White filming. The updated version pales in comparison.\n",
      "My wife and I had never seen this movie and bought it not thinking it would be any good.  It was much better entertainment than we expected and is going to be a new holiday tradition for us.It's not your typical old black and white movie.  The story is excellent.\n",
      "A Christmas classic on Blue Ray disc,This is a story that should be on everyone's movie shelf.Keep it handy for the holidays.\n",
      "The movie Miracle on 34th Street is one of my favorite Christmas movies.  I was able to get it for a small amount of money.\n",
      "Don't let cute little Natalie Wood and the heartwarming plot fool you... this is a wickedly funny comedy that is easily the best Christmas movie ever made.Maureen O'Hara is wonderful as the scorned woman (isn't it funny how a female character in a romantic comedy from the 1940's is so strong and independant, while nowadays the romatic leads are usually scatterbrained flaky blondes?), and Natalie Wood steals the show as the perfectly well brought up little girl who confuses imagination with schitzophrenia (\"it's when you think you see something that isn't there\" she tells Kris Kringle).I remember loving this movie as a child, but it is actually a grown-up movie.  Politics, pop psychology, and commercialism all take a wicked beating... if you are looking for treakly magical endings, you might be surprised at the motives behind what finally 'saves the day.'If you've never seen it, or if you've only seen the 1994 sacharine-sticky-sweet remake, then you must see this movie.  It is great for all ages: the kids will see the heartwarming plot, and the teenagers and adults will understand the delightful cynisism that crops up in the most surprising places.\n",
      "This is a wonderfully campy story that always entrances children of all ages.  A story that always entrances children, and brings out the children in all of us.......\n",
      "This is as most of us know a really great Holiday Movie. The only mistake I made was buying a Black and White movie in Blu-ray. It didn't change a thing. It was still in BLACK & WHITE. I paid extra for this lesson. Never again will I BUY a Black and White movie in Blu-ray what a ripoff.\n",
      "This is a feel good movie and a Christmas favorite every year.  Even the anti-sapmaster, my old man, loves this movie.  Nat is terrific and \"cute\" and O'Hara is beautiful.  It just plain makes you feel like Christmas.\n",
      "Always loved this one, when i was a child, it was because the Santa really did look real and I believed.  When I grew up, I still loved it because of the HOPE and REAL emotion going on as we all want to believe in Santa, even when we know he is just a good feeling in all of us.  Sort of a guardian angel out there at Christmas time.  This movie makes me happy.\n",
      "One of my favorite holiday films of all time.  Especially, since I worked in Macy's the first time I saw it and was very familiar with a lot of the interior scenes including the employee locker area.The scene where the judge is buried by the Santa mail is priceless!  Hard to believe that the girl was a young Natalie Wood.\n",
      "There's a reason that almost 60 years later, this durable classic still touches the hearts of filmgoers:  it's beautiful heartwarming story of believing and having faith in others.  Edmund Gwenn deservedly won a supporting actor Oscar for his role as Kris Kringle, a department store Santa who says he really is the jolly old fellow.  Once the nasty corporate psychologist (a delightful Porter Hall) gets hold of Kris, though, we find our Santa facing commitment in a mental home unless lawyer John Payne (a great performance here) can provide legitimate proof that Kris is who he says he is.  The movie is lovingly performed and produced and stands the test of time, and most of  today's Christmas movies pale in comparison.  Maureen O'Hara is a lovely mama; the late Natalie Wood shows her star was shining brightly even at the age of nine; and veteran character actors Gene Lockhart, William Frawley, Thelma Ritter and Jack Albertson all add to the festivities.  Truly one of our finest Christmas movies.\n",
      "It's a good movie with a good message.  And it lacks the gratuitous sex and violence so prevalent in movies today.\n",
      "I feel like there was never a time that I didn't know MIRACLE ON 34th STREET, so intimately is this wonderful movie connected with the Christmas season. MIRACLE is a richer and more complex film than many take it to be, and it can be enjoyed on more that one level. It is a heart-warming parable of child-like faith overcoming cynicism. It is also a satire on big business, commercialism, psychoanalysis (which was becoming popular in the 1940's), and political machines. For me, the most interesting element of the movie is the subplot involving the psychiatrist, Mr. Sawyer (Porter Hall), who has ambitions of being a psychoanalyst but is stuck in an unfulfilling job giving intelligence tests. He dabbles in Freudian studies on the side and, filled with delusions of grandeur, thinks that he is qualified to psychoanalyze Alfred, an impressionable young boy who works at Macy's. This encroachment on the innocence of children raises the ire of Kris Kringle, the Macy's Santa Claus with delusions of his own; by acting out his anger on Sawyer, he gets himself committed to a sanitarium. That Sawyer is ultimately defeated (when Mr. Macy fires him) is fitting and just, but also - like many villains in classic drama - gives him a hope of redeeming himself. Porter Hall, Gene Lockhart (as the judge), Philip Tonge, William Frawley, Jerome Cowan, Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, and young Natalie Wood all make this movie sparkle; and as for Edmund Gwenn - what can I say? - he IS Santa Claus!\n",
      "One of the best Christmas movies! Its up there with Its A Woderful Life. A must have in your collection.\n",
      "Great movie!!  Classic christmas movie.  The remake is good too, but everyone should have the original.\n",
      "I've seen all the versions of Miracle on 34th Street and the 1947 version is the best.  Since I'm in my 60s I may have a bias towards the stars that were around in my youth, e.g. John Payne, Maureen O'hara, Natalie Wood, William Frawley, etc.\n",
      "This modern version is very well done. I love and own the 1947 version, but also added this to our Christmas favorites too. I recommend to all, it's a good film.\n",
      "Got this for my Dad for Christmas and he loved it.  The original is such a great movie.  Glad it's in Blu-ray\n",
      "I remember watching the original b/w version of \"Miracle on 34th Street\" with Maureen O'Hara and Natalie Wood and was pleasantly surprised to find that this Special Edition came with the original AND a colorized version.  COOL!  Thanks!  As always, it arrived quickly and safely from Amazon.com.\n",
      "You just can't go wrong with this wonderful Christmas classic of wonder and hope.  I BELIEVE! I prefer the black and white version, but having the color version is a great addition to our collection.\n",
      "Good movie and is in black and white or color.  One of my favorite holiday movies that you can watch during Thanksgiving weekend since it starts with the Macy's parade.\n",
      "A Great Christmas Favorite that never gets out of date even though it's over 60 years old. Some great moral lessons that anyone can learn & re-learn no matter how old we are. The acting is superb and brings back many memories of days gone by that needs repeating every year. Most of these actors have passed on and left us but has left us with loving memories. I suggest that every one young & Old needs to see this one especially before Christmas. I watch it every year at this time. A 5 Star performance.\n",
      "This is one of my Christmas classic favorites!  I had it on VHS, but wanted it on DVD.  This is still my favorite version of this movie.  Natalie Wood was a wonderful child actress.\n",
      "This is such a traditional movie to watch each Xmas.  I watch it every year and will pass it down to my grandchildren!\n",
      "Great classic movie for the holidays! I would recommend this movie highly. By far one of the best Christmas story of all time.\n",
      "I am reminded of a Natalie Wood interview. She was not sure that the actor playing Santa was not the real thing. She was so young when she made the film & I heard she made 2 other films at the same time. A true Christmas classic and much better in black and white. The early colorized ones were awful. Didn't see one with extras so I can't tell you about that.\n",
      "Miracle on 34th Street was a good choice for colorizing. I love B&W; films and would never want to see them colorized such as Casablanca and It's a Wonderful Life. There always are exceptions --- 'Miracle' is a classic Christmas film but not a classic example of B&W; photography. Seeing Santa in color seems right. The colors are actually very muted and the DVD cover picture is not representative of the look unless they have enhanced it since my copy was made.Another old colorized film that I recommend is Laurel and Hardy's March of the Wooden Soldiers/Babes in Toyland. The setting  in Toyland demands color and helps elevates the film. It is one of my favorites.\n",
      "The original Miracle on 34th street is a must watch for me every year.  It takes me back to the days of my youth watching it with my family on the old black and white.  The new one is good but this has my heart.\n",
      "Miracle on 34th Street is not only a classical Christmas movie, but simply a hollywood classic that can never be forgotten.With an all-star cast of Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Edmund Gwenn, and Natalie Wood, this movie shows what good acting and plot are all about.  Oh sure, there's been a remake of this classic like many others, which I haven't seen, but I hear it's not even worth watching because the story is so convoluted.For starters, the acting is great and each actor/actress portrays his/her character extremely well.  The writing is great also in that the lines are never corny and every situation in the movie is meaningful.  But what makes this movie a classic is its acting.  All of the actors/actresses got along very well while filming this movie and it is evident in their performance.  The chemistry between the characters is genuine and really makes the movie come to life.I truly pitty all those who dare say that the remake of this film is just as good or better than the original.  NO REMAKE ever beats classic movies.  I still scratch my head in confusion when directors try to do so.If you're contemplating whether you should buy this movie, don't.  BUY it as soon as you can.  It's a classic and you can preserve it in DVD format.\n",
      "What's not to love?  The original with a full star cast!  Better than any of the numerous (2 tv, 1 hollywood) remakes!  Watched it with my 7 year old, and brought tears to my eyes again (as it does every time).  Now I don't have to wait for one of the broadcast stations to decide it's Christmas time to see one of the best movies ever.  What a great story.And even better...if you are purist and don't like to see the pastel-colored-colorization version of old black and white masterpieces...no worries!  You can watch either version.  Add to that the added special features and featurettes...and this is the best purchase I've made this year!\n",
      "This is the second movie that I watch during the holiday season.  The movie starts out with the Macys Thanksgiving day parade and ends at Christmas.  It covers the entire season and is inspirational. I just love this movie.  It has to be this version, though.\n",
      "You can never go wrong with this movie.  Even my kids love this as a classic Christmas movie. Merry Christmas.\n",
      "Wonderfully done story of Santa Claus in New York.  Edmund Gwenn plays Santa, who replaces a drunk fake-Santa in Macy's Christmas parade, and becomes everyone's favorite.  Even the little girl who doesn't believe in Santa...a very young Natalie Wood...starts to believe.  With Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, and William Frawley, this one is truly a must see, and a classic for every Christmas.\n",
      "this is one of my favorite christmas movies of all time. i really love this movie and was very pleased with my purchase\n",
      "The best \"Miracle On 34th Street\" movie ever made!  Natalie Wood was great, as well as the rest of cast!\n",
      "This is a classic to the entire Christmas movie collection that no one should be without!  It brings back memories when my husband and I were children as well as now establishing traditions with our grandchildren!  If Kris Kringle can change the hardened Macy's executive Doris Walker to believe in Christmas, he will make you into a believe in Christmas too!  Merry Christmas everyone!  GMomma D\n",
      "Miracle on 34th Street is one of the best holiday films and made a star of little Natalie Wood.Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) is a widow with a young daughter Susan (Natalie Wood).  Doris believes that the best way to raise her daughter is to always tell her the truth and not foster any of the childhood fantasies.Doris works at Macy's and it's Thanksgiving Day.  She is in charge of the talent.  And she has a big problem, Santa is drunk.  Luckily the perfect replacement has been found.  A man named Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn), and even better he has his own suit!He is hired to be the store Santa.  There's one problem, he thinks that he is Santa Claus.  Also, he lives out of town.  So Doris' neighbor Fred Gailey (John Payne) decides to let him stay with him.At the store, Kris is a hit.  And a little too good at his job.  A refugee from Europe wants to talk to Santa but she does not speak English, but he speaks her language fluently.  He also sends customers to other stores if the item requested is less expensive.Of course, you need a bad guy.  Kris befriends Alfred, a young boy at Macy's.  When Alfred is told that he is delusional for wanting to be a store Santa, Kris comes to his defense but he looses his temper and raps the psychiatrist.  The psychiatrist has him committed.Susan is upset by this and asks Fred for help.  Fred decides to take go to court.  This leads to a great court battle that is decided by the US Postal Service on Christmas Eve.The ending is truly inspirational.This film is Black and White and should be seen that way.  I know you want see Maureen O'Hara's beautiful red hair but then get The Quiet Man or The Parent Trap.The performances are perfect all around.  Maureen O'Hara is probably the most underrated actress of her time.  This is another wonderful picture perfect performance.  This is Natalie Wood's first major role and she showed why she was a major star until her untimely death.  Edmund Gwenn was a great character actor and this was his crowning role and Oscar winning role.This is a perfect film for the holidays.  It will get the whole family in the holiday spirit.DVD EXTRAS: None\n",
      "I already own this, but one of my sisters didn't have it and it wasn't on television this Christmas.  So I got it for her.  It contains both the colorized and the original black and white version. Thoroughly  enjoyable!  A must have!\n",
      "Miracle On 34th Street(1947) is without a doubt one of the best holiday films ever to be brought to the big screen, and has since become a family classic to many people all over.  As its theatrical trailer will atest, Miracle On 34th Street has everything: Comedy, Drama, Surprises, Suspense, Magic, Heart & so much more!The DVD transfer is beautiful!  Nice and sharp and crisp.  Now I'm not someone who has a problem watching Black & White films, but the original Miracle On 34th Street also had a colorized version, derived from a very impressive color transfer using computer technology.  I own this version on VHS (which sadly is out of print) and wondered why 20th Century Fox didn't just include both versions on the DVD?  Trust me, there's plenty of room on the disc for the black & white and the colorized version.  I'll admit, many color versions of black & white films are terrible (It's A Wonderful Life is the perfect example), but I was really impressed with the color version of 'Miracle.  The colors are rich and bright and the detail of the picture is still quite sharp and pristine.  I employ you, 20th Century Fox, to consider giving the public both the color and b&w versions on DVD, just like the original A Christmas Carol(1951) was released (with both versions on one disc).  If both versions are put together, then people can decide for themselves if they want to watch it in black & white or color, and you'll only broaden the films appeal by doing so.  Happy Holidays!Miracle On 34th Street - A True Classic!\"I believe...I believe...it's silly, but I believe\" - Natalie Wood as Susie WalkerPS - The scene with the little Dutch girl is my favorite!  :-)\n",
      "A fantastic film and if you happen not to have seen it (!!) a treat for christmas. Despite the deceiving cover, it's just the Black & White version. Still brilliant though and a must for everyone's christmas collection.\n",
      "Well, it's Christmas Eve and I've started my annual Christmas movie marathon. This year, I watched an old favorite 'The Miracle On 34th Street'. The film is as fresh now as it was in it's original release. The film's message about commercialism taking control of the holiday rings truer each passing year!For those who aren't familiar with this wonderful holiday film, it's at the top of the list of great Christmas films. The cast, script and pacing are perfect. The 2 disc DVD release has commentary by star Maureen O'Hara, AMC Hollywood Back-story, A 45 minute made for TV remake of the film, which is very good and an excellent DVD transfer in both Black & White and Color!Merry Christmas Everyone!\n",
      "A timely classic that you should have with your Christmas DVD's.  The original movie much better than all the other remakes\n",
      "The 2007 brand new beautifully color enhanced version of \"Miracle on 34th St.\" is not the same color version as the one made in the '90's.  It is also certainly not the same as the first color version made in the '80's.  It's a brand new 2007 color technology produced color version.  Whoever thinks this is the same color version, be it the AFT color version of the '90's or the bad '80's color version is wrong, this is an excellently color enhanced 2007 version.  I know this for a fact because I watched the '90's A.F.T. version and the new Legend color version side by side as I watched this movie Christmas time 2007.  The new version is sharp, clear, colors are nice and bright (no more brownish or dark reds, the reds are now bright and red red) and the movie now looks like it was originally shot in color.  That's the best complement you can give a colorized movie.  It's beautiful.  Even some colors of things like ties, dresses, scenery background on the wall are different colors now than they were in the '90's color version.  Watching these side by side on a split screen I could see first hand the vast improvements this 2007 version is over the past color versions.  This ain't your Daddy's colorization anymore.  So get over the snob/elitist comments.  Welcome to a big beautiful colorful world.  B/W you're thru.  Now please color ALL the rest of the drab b/w movies and TV shows then I'll be in heaven.\n",
      "This is an all time classic and won't ever lose it's standings as an all time favorite.  I don't watch any of the remakes of the good ole classics....nothing better than a couch with your favorite blanket and a great old movie that you don't have to worry about the content being unexceptable for any child to see.  LOVE THE CLASSICS!!!  :)\n",
      "Natalie Wood steals the show as precocious Susan Walker who doesn't believe in Santa Claus. So, who shows up but old Kris Kringle himself, delightfully portrayed by Edmund Gwenn. The sweet and endearing Kringle touches everyone he encounters and proclaims that he is, indeed, Santa Claus. Those who don't believe seek to have him committed and a hearing ensues. Is Kringle successful in proving his identity? Does Susan have a change of heart? Sit back for 90 minutes and see how it all unfolds. You won't be disappointed.\n",
      "OK Let me start off by saying this is a Great Classic Christmas Movie. Now the BR is misleading as some People claim it contains both the B&W as well as the Colorized versions of this film. This BR disc does not it only contains the B&W version. The colorized version is not on BR.\n",
      "One can never go wrong with Miracle on 34th Street~!  This movie is a classic.  I highly recommend putting it in your yearly watched holiday movies!!!\n",
      "It is a wonderful movie and I wanted it on dvd with the original actors. Item was just as described.\n",
      "THIS is the best, most heartwarming version of this classic Christmas movie. To have it colorized is the icing on the cake! Don't hesitate to purchase it!!!\n",
      "Arrived quickly and although I haven't viewed it, I know my mom will love the original and colored version. This is a great deal for the price, 2 movies plus all the extras.\n",
      "When I first received this movie there was some problems with the DVD, but Amazon made good with it and replaced it. But when I was able to finally watch this I was so pleasantly surprised. I love this so much more than the remake!! Boy have I been missing out!! I love Natalie Wood and Maureen O'Hara. Great acting by the entire cast. I was so surprised to see William Frawley (the actor who played Fred Mertz from I Love Lucy) in this. When I have a family of my own, I can't wait to share this with them. This will definitely be a must watch for Christmas time when I have kids. It's important for adults and children to still believe and have faith in things.\n",
      "I was four when this movie came out and it is a classic.  Always magical and always heartwarming.  Love it! Looks like Christmas when I was a child.\n",
      "I suppose I have a stronger memory of this film from childhood than of any other holiday-themed movie, save perhaps A CHRISTMAS CAROL - but there I'm probably remembering at least 2 or 3 versions all sort of mushed together.  The '47 MIRACLE stands alone though, and Edmund Gwenn will forever be Santa Claus to me.The film opens documentary-style, with the camera following an old conventionally-dressed man (Gwenn) down the street in New York, snow falling lightly.  He taps on a window pane - the startled shop employee, fixing up a holiday display of Santa and his reindeer opens the door to see what he wants, only to be remonstrated pleasantly on the proper placement of the toy animals.  You see, this old man knows what he's talking about.  Soon he spots a drunken Santa at the Macy's parade and after upbrading him is replaced - and then hired as the department store's ambassador for the holiday season.  But he's no ordinary pretending elf, as the store's staff psychologist Mr. Sawyer (Porter Hall) finds out - nor is he willing to pretend to the public that Macys is the be-all and end-all of their shopping needs, recommending that customers go elsewhere if they can't find it in Herald Square.If you don't know the rest, well, you should, and I won't spoil it for you.  Suffice it to say that Santa/Kris manages to charm lawyer Fred Gailey (the underrated John Payne) smitten with his neighbor Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara), who happens to be the woman who hired him, and takes on as his special project the re-introduction of the woman's far-too-serious young daughter Susan (Natalie Wood) to worlds of myth, fantasy, and belief.  When Kris's sanity is questioned, and Mr. Sawyer contrives to get him sent to Bellevue, it's up to these three to prove that he is, in fact, the magical spirit he claims to be.Despite the whole story being essentially about belief - about whether one ought to have \"proof\" for everything, about whether things are always as they seem to be - one of the most interesting elements of MIRACLE is the complete lack of religious elements.  Perhaps the word \"God\" is mentioned in passing once or twice; I'm fairly sure \"Jesus\" never is.  Santa Claus here represents human goodness and kindness and generosity - which aren't, after all, specific to Christianity or Christmas.  They're human values belonging to all peoples and all faiths, and the film doesn't reduce it's message to reflect the holiday itself even if the setting reflects it.  One could, I suppose, posit that Doris and Susan's lack of belief in Santa or anything demanding \"faith\" is indicative of a spiritual lack, but the film wisely doesn't push hard on this notion, leaving it up to us to decide just what (besides Santa and childhood games) they might be missing in their lives.The casting is just wonderful - Gwenn won a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar, though I think he's closer to being the lead, and Payne and O'Hara and Wood are all quite fine as well.  Gene Lockhart as the sort-of-principled judge and Philip Tonge as Doris' coworker Mr. Shellhammer nearly steals every scene he's in.  The location work in New York is a pleasant surprise in a film made in this era and certainly lends an air of authenticity; like the opening scene, the Macys parade has a documentary feel to it that isn't typical for the studio-bound productions that were nearly all of Hollywood's output at this time.  The only real problem I have with it is the rather too speedy wrap-up; it's always hard to pull real drama out of a courtroom scene when you know how it's got to end, and the 'evidence' supplied (by both sides) must have seemed rather silly even in 1947.  But no matter - the fantasy elements are always stirring underneath this ostensibly realistic look at the myth, and I still get a kick out of the last shot.  Ho-ho-ho.\n",
      "I know there were other \"Miracle on 34th Street\" presentations but this is the one and only. No other can compare with the way this story is presented. I loved it as a child and still love it as an adult. It is a true classic.\n",
      "I watched the movie every Christmas Eve as a child and I have seen it probably 100 times, but I still love it!  I was thrilled that you still had it.  I haven't recieved it as yet, but I expect it will be anyday.\n",
      "A perpetual Christmas favorite, this was part of a CD movie pack that I gave my hubby for Christmas. We both love it. Thanks for the speedy shipping.\n",
      "I love the movie it's a family classic and we watch it every year. It sucks that we used to watch it on tv and now we have to pay to see it\n",
      "This is a wonderful, holiday movie with such a clever storyline. I watch it every year and enjoy it like it was my first viewing. Proving someone is the real Santa is a great storyline and I highly recommend it.\n",
      "It was wonderful to be able to view one of our favorite movies when we wanted to.I'm go glad this movie was available.  Thanks, again.\n",
      "This version of miracle of 34th street is the best!  I love the part where the Dutch girl visits Santa Claus!  She doesn't speak English, so he talks and sings to her in Dutch!  Makes me cry every time.\n",
      "Very happy to get this version in color. Plus a 2 disc set for a great price.\n",
      "Nice to have this in my DVD Christmas collection.  We enjoy watching movies without commercial interruptions.  And, the grandkids like to see what Nana and li'l Opa have to watch.\n",
      "Of course I love it. Who doesn't? This movie IS Christmas. The movie was in fine condition when I received it and I'm still enjoying it. A Christmas time \"must have!\"\n",
      "Beautiful classic Christmas story from a time when Hollywood was still Christian. The quality of the actors is outstanding, including the young Nathalie Wood in her screen debut.\n",
      "This is a great movie...it's not just a x-mas movie, it's a classic family-friendly movie reminding us not to take ourselves too seriously and to put common sense aside sometimes and simply have faith.  The dvd was quality.  I also enjoyed watching the special features & learning about the making of the movie.\n",
      "This is a great movie and to get it in a Special Edition was a bonus.  I love this classic movie and am glad to retire my VHS for this DVD.\n",
      "I have to say, I am so impressed with how quickly this DVD was delivered to me! In less than 3 days of ordering I received it in the mail. I am still waiting on another order I placed on December 9th to deliver but I am amazed at how quickly this arrived. Excellent seller!\n",
      "Having both the black & white and color versions as well as the Maureen OHara commentary is so well worth the price. A great bargain and I'm looking forward to watching every year!!\n",
      "Miracle on 34th Street (Special Edition)This movie is the best one to watch with children that are questioning the reality of Santa, since it gives a foundation to the fact that we can believe in what we want. As they get older, children seem to lean toward the belief that there is no Santa, thus removing the \"fun\" of the holiday. The idea that a big man with a white beard and a jolly laugh will bring you gifts if you are good is a long-time belief that keeps kids wondering, as they try to \"be good\" so they'll get their just rewards. When that belief is gone, the holiday joy is also gone. This movie shows just this.The little girl in the movie is not a believer to begin with, but the arrival of Kris Kringle and events that transpire during the movie have her changing her belief by the end of the movie. The movie plot is enjoyable every year, no matter how many times it's shown on TV. Owning the movie means you won't have to wait until one of the stations decide to show it - you can make that decision yourself!We hope you can have the same enjoyment from this movie that our family has had.\n",
      "Love this movie for Christmas.  Remake can't beat the original.  Great with color pictures too becaue you can see all details.\n",
      "The Original!  The Very Best version!  I watch it every year!  Now I'll have it on DVD instead of VCR.\n",
      "I think this on the greatest christmas movies of all time a must have. If you haven't seen this movie then you should check it out you'll enjoy it and for those of you who has seen this movie go ahead and treat your self to it.\n",
      "This is the \"Miracle on 34th Street\" I remember from childhood.  It is one of my favorite movies of all time and none of the remakes compare.The set includes both the black and white and colorized versions.  The colorized version is the one shown on television, not something new and improved.  The opening scene was grainy and the color was distorted, as if to remind us this is an old movie.  The black and white version is crisp, as it was meant to be shown.  Both versions offer the option to view the movie with the Maureen O'Hara commentary, which she does throughout the movie.I found O'Hara's commentary interesting.  Sometimes, she just described what was happening in the scene, which we could see for ourselves.  Other times, she would describe what it was like to work with an actor or what was happening behind that scene or on the set.  That was a special treat and I sat glued to the set to watch the movie a second time just to hear her talk.\"AMC Backstory\" gave a history of the movie and some of the problems behind the set.  I found it fascinating, but I did not like that it was cut into clips and run like on television with all the pauses put in for commercials, except we didn't see any commercials.  Certainly those pauses could have been edited out.Also included are the Thanksgiving day parade footage, promotional shorts and the poster gallery.I was looking forward to the little booklets often inserted into DVD sets, but this set lacks one.  Still, it is a wonderful set.\n",
      "I really appreciate the innocence and simplicity of the little girl, and the evolution of her mother's belief in the good points of life.  In addition, I like the movie putting the ideals of the real Christmas out there, even though it is a story of Santa Claus.  For me, the remake doesn't come close to the emotion of this one.\n",
      "Yes it is an older movie that has been redone more than once. This version is also so very touching and so appropriate to remind us all what Christmas is for and to move our soul and mind to the meaning of this season we celebrate! Great to have for personal library of seasonal movies.\n",
      "This movie is one of the all time classic movies ever made,great stars,wonderfull story,just a classic.We had this movie on vhs,years ago,and wanted to get it on dvd,to add to my collection,glad I found it on Amazon and for the right price.This is a movie classic that every family should watch or at least try to have in there movie collection at home,just pure holesome entertainment,something that you just don't see anymore in todays films as far as I'm concerned,a must watch for all.\n",
      "This is well worth the money.  The restoration on it is great and the large amount of content is amazing.  We watch this every year.... It is a classic that often never makes it to the TV screen anymore.\n",
      "I have always loved this movie.  I just wish it had been the black and white version.  Great Classic !\n",
      "I enjoyed the movie.It brought tears to my eyes.It gives you a warm and cheerful feelingat the same time.Thank you\n",
      "All time classic. I have watched this movie sinceI was a small child. It was a tradition on Christmas Eve. Wonderful movie.Would recommend.\n",
      "I live this new version just about as much as the older version.\n",
      "This is my favorite Christmas Movie of all time. This version includes 2 discs -one with the black & white version and one with the colorized version. It is the story of a skeptical young girl Susan and her mother Doris who runs the Macy's Parade and hires the new store Santa by the name of Kris Kringle. Doris no longer believes in the magic of Christmas but Susan begins to believe that the new Santa is real. The writing and acting are excellent and the characters feel real.This is the perfect movie for a family movie night or for watching while wrapping presents or for a snowy afternoon by the fire.\n",
      "It is nice that the movie comes in both the colorized and original black and white versions so people can make the choice of which one they would rather watch.I still prefer it in black and white over color any day, this is one of my favorites!\n",
      "I still think this one is the best version made - so genuine. Makes me smile just thinking about it.\n",
      "The package was well wrapped with plastic and showed no sign of damage!!This has been on a wish list for a long time....so I know the recipient will love it!!\n",
      "This was my first time watching this movie, both I and my children ages 6 & 4 loved it. I plan on buying the DVD so that it can become a holiday tradition for us to watch it every year!\n",
      "This version is the original black and white one. It brings back the good ole days when life was less complicated.\n",
      "The movie itself is a matter of taste...my wife loves it.  The movie was delivered promptly and in brand new condition.\n",
      "Cannot stand the remakes of this movie, this is the only one to watch.  Maureen O'Hara, Edmund Gwenn, Natalie Wood are perfect together and the story still makes me cry every time.\n",
      "HAD THIS MOVIE ON VHS AND GLAD TO FIND IT ON DVD!!!  THIS IS A WONDERFUL FILM ABOUT KEEPING THE CHILD INSIDE!!!  I LOVED IT WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, AND I STILL LOVE IT NOW AND LOOK FORWARD TO WATCHING IT EVERY YEAR.  WE WATCH IT ON THANKSGIVING, IN PREPARATION FOR XMAS.  GREAT MOVIE!!  GREAT ACTORS!!!\n",
      "Love this movie!  Gives the good feeling all is right with the world!  Recommended for all \"children!\"  Great Christmas movie!\n",
      "loved watching this as a kid, never gets old!  like it much better than the updated version.  ! ! !\n",
      "Greatest Santa Claus! He really \"makes you believe\"! He is also the best looking Santa! I love Maureen's story, when she was on the Johnny Carson Show.  Around Christmas time when she was talking with some friends, outside of church, she felt a tug on her coat>. She turned around and had to look down. There was this small child who said, \"Are you the lady who knows Santa Claus?\" She responded to the child. \"Yes I am and I know him very well!\" I can just imagine the expression on the child's face! Maureen says this happens quite frequently.\n",
      "If you haven't seen this movie, you have really been missing something special. It is the original and the best. It should be everyone's way to kick off the holiday season. It's a classic. Natalie Wood is so adorable and believable. A must have for any movie library.\n",
      "One of the two movies we play for family visiting at Christmas every year (Laurel and Hardy's March of the Wooden Soldiers is the other).  This movies shows the magic of Santa Claus, whether real or just due to the belief in him.  A little girl who was taught by her mother that 'fairy tales' are just that, and there is no Santa or Easter Bunny or Tooth Fairy, learns to believe in Santa after meeting him.  With the help of a neighbor, played by John Payne, the mother learns to believe too.Lots of drama, humor, and tender scenes.  Will make you believe, too.\n",
      "\"Miracle On 34th Street\" is 20th Century-Fox's 1947 Christmas carol.  Much to the surprise of virtually everybody who was involved in that picture, however, it endures today as a parable of faith, of \"believing when 'common-sense' tells you you shouldn't.\"The question of \"Is there a Santa Claus?\" is dispensed with in the opening footage of this film (Edmund Gwenn, in a totally-deserved Oscar performance, handles that issue very nicely); \"Miracle\" concerns itself, rather, with the question of Santa's 'nature,' who he truly is as well as how he operates.\"Miracle's\" plot is more than slightly complex: it addresses issues beyond the simple question of faith vs. rationale (which it handles, by the way, more than adequately); it likewise turns upon a postwar issue of psychology -- both in Doris Walker's (Maureen O'Hara) Spock-inspired approach to child-rearing, as well as Granville Sawyer's (Porter Hall) 'pop-psyche' analysis of various individuals, which leads to the film's ultimate crisis point -- while also grounding itself in the reality-based world of New York City politics (catch William Frawley's pre-\"I Love Lucy\" turn as a political fixer as he guides Gene Lockhart's Judge Harper through the court hearings).  There are also some snide, laughing-up-one's-sleeve, references to certain \"only slightly-crazy persons . . .  such as artists, composers, and some persons in Washington,\" which help to give this film a sense of verisimilitude.Such is the balance which this film achieves -- augmented by the location footage inside Macy's Manhattan store, the 1946 Thanksgiving parade, and various scenes around Manhattan courthouses -- that makes it work.  Much against your will, possibly, you may find yourself beginning to believe in all sorts of wondrous things.And if that's not a bona fide miracle . . .  then it's up to you to tell me what is!\n",
      "I love this movie.  A must have movie.  A must see for those who have not seen it. Wonderful movie.\n",
      "Miracle on 34th streetgreat classic family movie that inspires without an agenda. Remakes can't compare and don't do it justice.  love maureen o'hara and little natalie wood.\n",
      "Miracle on 34th Street 91 (1947) is a great movie and well acted and that is why I gave this a 5 star rating. Recommended for all ages.\n",
      "Wonderful edition! The television program was nice to see, but it is merely a chopped down redo of the movie, using most of the same script. The acting pales compared to the actual film, but is all right. The colorized version still does not sit well with me, I prefer the original black and white versions of films. All in all, however, this is a great buy!\n",
      "I mean the black and white version!  Don't get me started on coloration of classics!But this movie has a lot of charm.  Natalie Wood is sweet and cute without being sickening.  Edmund Gwenn gives a wonderful and believable performance as Santa.  Nothing beats the courtroom scene as John Payne brings on witnesses for \"Santa\" -- like the DA's son -- and the final \"proof\" brings a smile to your face.  All very good performances and a classic that gets better every year!\n",
      "A true classic that can't be replaced.  The actors in this are so great, and the video is wonderfully made!\n",
      "Such a classic whether via movie or play we love to watch this every year!  Such a sweet story filled with joy\n",
      "This movie is a wonderful classic and really brings forth the spirit of Christmas as no other movie can do.  I had this movie on video tape, but wanted to have it on DVD as tapes are being fazed out. I am so happy to have this movie and enjoyed it several times already and will for many many years to come.\n",
      "It's not really Christmas unless you watch Miracle on 34th Street on Thanksgiving day (which isn't happening any more).It's for children of every age but especially for those younger ones who still \"believe.\"  It recalls a time when life was simpler and people really cared about one another.  And you didn't have be a Christian to enjoy the fun of Christmas.\n",
      "One of my favorites.  I watch it every year and never get tired of it.  A classic for all times.\n",
      "Colorized version of Miracle on 34th Street. A wonderful tradition to watch every year. Will be watching this along with \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" \"A Christmas Carol,\" \"Elf,\" \"White Christmas,\"  \"The Santa Claus,\" & \"The Santa Claus II\"\n",
      "I have always enjoyed this, I had it on the vhs and wanted it to where I could watch it now.  Wish all would watch and get the spirit of Christmas but also know that the reason for the season if Jesus Christ.\n",
      "Classic movie.  A must have for everyone's collection. Can't wait to get the shipment and view the movie with a young family member that hasn't seen it yet.\n",
      "The 1947 version is the best of them in this Christmas classic.  It is a Christmas tradition. Good for the whole family\n",
      "One of the SINGLE GREATEST CHRISTMAS MOVIES EVER MADE!!DON'T get ANY OTHER VERSION of THIS MOVIE!!THIS is the Original and ONLY version to get!!If I could give this film 100 Stars, I WOULD!!GET IT--It will become part of your Christmas Traditions ALWAYS!!\n",
      "Love this movie, teaches us to believe in things we don't think are possible, a very good job of showing how to trust ohers\n",
      "This is a classic Christmas movie, one of the season's favorites for years, and years to come, I am sure.\n",
      "The year 1947 produced two Christmas tales for the ages, The Bishop's Wife and this one. Though they differ in tone, both reach deeply into human emotions and create experiences that really do border on the miraculous. The story concerns the sudden appearance at Macy's department store in New York City of a man who goes by the name Kris Kringle and claims to be the real Santa Claus. There is conflicting evidence, but Kris (Edmund Gwenn) does seem to have special knowledge about Christmas. And whether he's real or delusional, Mr. Macy (Harry Antrim) wants him on the job because he's getting everyone into the holiday spirit. So it falls upon Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) the store's employee responsible for its annual Thanksgiving Day Parade - whose belief in miracles has been sorely tested by a bad marriage - to host Mr. Kringle for the holiday season. That arrangement brings him into contact with Doris's young daughter Susan (an amazingly good Natalie Wood at 9 years old) and her sympathetic neighbor Fred Gailey (John Payne). Things seem to be going fine when ... well, that's far enough. Just know that the story proceeds to the most delightful courtroom scene ever, and that by the time the movie is over, you just might recover your belief in both Santa and miracles.

      "I cannot understand why anyone even tried to do a remake! This film is both a family tradition and a classic. The performances were superb. It would not be Xmas without watching this and  \"It's a Wonderful Life\"\n",
      "Good clean movie that makes you have fun watching it and also seeing how a girl changes her mind about Santa and her mother changes her mind about Santa.\n",
      "While the remake with Attenborough is quite wonderful, this original version with Edmund Gwen, Natalie Wood, Maureen O'Hara and John Payne is still the best there is of this story.\n",
      "Its a classic.  Had a special visitor for Christmas one year who had lost all of her family in death.  For her this movie was part of Christmas.  So we had to have it.\n",
      "Much needed insight for the times!Watch the picture carefully; closely examine the character of Chris Cringle and emulate him!\n",
      "j'aime se film en noire et blanc de miracle sur la 34ème rue pour la premiere fois en  blu-ray disc je ne suis pas s'il il a une version colorisée du film\n",
      "It is just a wonderful movie. Has a nice story line and can be watched by all ages. It lets you believe again.\n",
      "Certain movies have kind of become a tradition in our family.  We always watch \"Christmas Vacation\" on Thanksgiving night, then between Thanksgiving and Christmas we always fit in \"Christmas Carol\" (1939 Version), \"It's a Wonderful Life\", \"Miracle on 34th Street\" and \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\".  It wouldn't be the Christmas season without them.\n",
      "What can be said that hasn't already been eloquently expressed by our fellow Amazon reviewers here?  Not much-but it's \"that time of the year\", I've just ordered the DVD of this classic film, and I can't help adding my two cents to set the goodwill overflowing.One of the very, very few films of this period to actually shoot on location in New York rather than on a studio backlot(fascinating scenes), this original \"Miracle\" is about as far from corny as it's possible to get(it's really the two later versions, one for TV, and one of several years ago, that veer increasingly into phoniness and corn).  There are loads of lessons here for any writer or director who might take on a holiday or \"fantasy\" film: just play it *straight*, don't cuten it up-period.  Every actor plays this wonderfully written screenplay brilliantly-down to the smallest part-a huge reason why, like \"Casablanca\", it's so watchable-over and over again.  John Payne and Maureen O'Hara play two real, live adults who-rare in films-both seem to have \"real\" lives; Maureen works at Macy's, and clearly takes her job seriously, a true professional.  The scenes which begin the story where she's desperately trying to wrangle the annual Macy's parade are almost documentarian-totally believable-and that's what helps make the moonshine of \"the REAL Santa Claus\" showing up work so well.  Quite differently from our current, special-effects-extravanga-fantasies that present to us an art director's idea of exactly how The North Pole, Santa's reindeer, etc.etc. look, this one leaves all that to our imaginations, and the incomparable Edmund Gwenn plays that jolly old soul with a perfect air of mystery and sagacity.  Others have written about Natalie Wood, and she is really unbelievably great.  Smart, natural, somehow turning scenes that could have been a little cringe-making(chewing gum with Kris at bedtime)into honestly charming and un-icky highlights.  That's a result of HER amazing talent.  If she were off by a hair, the film wouldn't be the perfect thing it is.  I should mention the score, by Alfred Newman, which is really masterfully scored-what that man did with \"Jingle Bells\"!  You've got to admit along with Susan(Wood)\"I believe, I believe, it's silly, but I believe\".  Silly and wonderful.\n",
      "There have been other versions made of this movie, but I will always love this first version as it's the one I grew up with.  This is a classic Christmas movie that I will watch year after year.\n",
      "Can't go wrong with this classic.  Helped me get into the mood of Christmas while wrapping presents and prepping cards.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite Christmas movies. It is a feel-good movie. I watch it every year with my family.\n",

      "I love this movie and wouldn't have Christmas pass by without watching it. The casting of ALL the characters is perfect, and the acting is first rate. I can't see how any part of this movie could be improved upon.  The best Santa movie ever made.\n",
      "This is a film we watch every year, one of the best ever.  This DVD bundle with two DVDs is also great in that it contains the original authentic B&W version as well as a separate DVD with the color version.  We tried the color this year; it was pretty well done.  Next year we'll do the B&W.  There's an audio interview with Maureen O'Hara you can switch on that's available as interjection while the film plays - a creative effort, but as it blocks so much of the dialogue yet is not continuous (i.e. half of the time during the film you hear her interview and half the regular dialogue).  It's kind of strange.  Interesting insights though.\n",
      "One of my all time favorites!  A must see every Christmas season!  So happy to have this to watch with just a click of my remote!\n",

      "A Christmas Classic!one of the most wonderful Christmas stories ever made. It is timelessand can be enjoyed by kid from 1 to 93.The Condon Family\n",
      "One of the best Christmas movies of all-time. I highly recommend the black and white version. I like to watch it every year.\n",
      "I enjoyed the service and the movie. I plan to show it in my high school classes next week  a great movie\n",
      "A great movie I've watched many times thru the years but decided it was time to have it in my home so we could watch it whenever we want.\n",
      "Great movie at a great price and speedy delivery.  Very happy with my Christmas Holiday Movie that I will get to enjoy for years to come\n",
      "Buy the Blu-ray at once. I have nothing to say about this film that you don't already know, but the Blu-ray transfer is crisp and perfect, and it's wonderful to be able to see the Macy's parade in full detail and enjoy immersing yourself in this timeless cinematic legacy. Put it on the shelf next to The Wizard of Oz.\n",
      "It was a fun movie to watch and left you with a smile on your face and in your heart.\n",
      "One of my favorite black and white Christmas tales and so glad I bought it. Good condition, no problem playing. I would purchase from this vendor again.\n",
      "the b&W look great in blue ray and still a timeless classic my whole family love it. My wife had not scene it.\n",
      "A hundred years from now it'll still be the classic that it is today. It reminds us all that Santa Claus exists in one form or another.\n",
      "This is a christmas classic and all should get a copy of it the true movie due to it the best one to watch and its great for the family this dvd has both black and white and the color one its a good buy\n",
      "Just watched this classic after years.  (In fact I realized that I had never seen the entire movie).  Absolutely wonderful and touching movie for the family.  Plays with the idea that Santa is real and is perfect for kids in the 5 - 7 age group who may be beginning to doubt Santa.  The colorized version is nicely done and you also  get the original  B& W version if you prefer to be authentic.  Can't go wrong.\n",
      "I was only 4 years old when this film came out, and so if my folks took me to see it, I do not remember!  However, in the following years it became a popular film to show at Christmas time, and it richly deserves all the adulation it gets.  I can just see the parents at the beginning of the film thinking: \"Uh oh. This is going to be a problem.\"  You don't want to lie to your children, but you have to give them something to look forward to, and what better person than a jovial Grandfather figure who hands out gifts of encouragement.  I remember a black period in my younger days when being naughty was NOT a good thing at all!  You don't get rewarded for naughtiness!  As with so many other things, it is the parents responsibility to instuct children in the ways of proper behavior, especially right from wrong.  I do not think that Santa Claus is kept a secret for very long, and it is not too traumatic a thing to let the truth be known — eventually.The film is so well cast and produced your worries over what the kids will think soon disappear.  John Payne always seemed to be overlooked as a versatile actor, but this was one of his shining moments.  Maureen O'Hara could always light up a film with her beauty and diction.  As for child actors, Natalie Wood shows a remarkable grasp of what is demanded of her, and delivers a very convincing performance.  Of course, none of this matters without Edmund Gwen — IMHO the best Santa ever!  Throughout all difficulties of having to simply say, \"I am who I am\", he convinces us that a straightforward approach is always best.  His simple belief in himself carries over to those he contacts and enriches all their lives — save for the professed psychiatrist!  And as he says, Christmas is not just a time of the year, but a year-round attitude!  If everyone thought that way, we wouldn't get ourselves in some of the predictaments that we do!\"Does Macy tell Gimbel's?\" is something you always heard growing up in New York.  So it must have come as quite a shock to theater-goers to see them shaking hands and exchanging customers!  (I confess to having done the very same thing every where I worked in my life.  Wonder where I got the idea from...?)  So many films today try to be clever and fail because they do not have the simple characteristics of films like this.  First of all, a great storyline/screenplay; terrific actors, wonderful direction and a production that sets it apart from films NOT shot like this one — lots of live stuff and letting people react naturally.  Could this be done today?  Maybe not.  I think it would require some very special, dedicated people and circumstances to carry it off!As for the film that came after this, the re-make starring Mr. Attenborough is certainly very good, but it does not quite have the appeal of the original — at least not to me.  Re-making a film decades later puts the producers and director in a quandry.  It is ever so hard to re-create the mood/atmosphere/appearance — whatever you wish to call it — that it is best to just go for a complete updating of the story.  For this reason so many classics remain just that — Classic film-making of a story in a certain time.  Consider \"The Bishop's Wife\", for comparison.  The remake does not try to be anything more than a facsimile, and in that it succeeds!Getting back to the DVD Special Edition of \"Miracle on  34th Street\", the package is just right.  We get a competant colorized version (done in the hues that I feel best reflect the 1940's era) and the original Black & White... We can choose which we wish to see.  I found the colorized version very compelling because of its lack of brilliance or color saturation.  I also own what I consider the best \"colorized film\" I have yet to see — \"The Mark of Zorro\" . (also purchased through Amazon!)  The drama of black & white seems best for some films of that day.  (Once again: \"The Bishop's Wife\", \"Casablanca\"...)As for extras, what more could be asked for than the wonderful Maureen O'Hara giving us a look behind the scenes!  The price being offered by Amazon is a small Christmas Miracle in itself.  And if you order things frequently enough (like I do) then \"Prime\" makes it even better.  It's hard to convey the 1940's into todays lifestyles and attitudes, but this film should make it easier for Gran dpa and Grandma to explain to the Grandchildren!  Do yourself a favor and get this edition for Christmas this year!  It's lost none of appeal to me over the last 65 years, and I think you might like it as well, given the way the story delivers its message.Hope you and yours enjoy the Happiest of Christmases and a Great New Year!\n",
      "See my review of John Wayne's True Grit. The remakes of this beautiful Holiday classic are further proof that classics should be left alone. The second, third, fourth, etc. versions never come close to the original. This great film proves that yet again. Edmund Gwenn is Santa Claus aka Kris Kringle. The others who played this role are only elves.\n",
      "I love this movie. It, along with A Christmas Carol, makes my holiday. I like this colorized version too. Maureen O'Hara is so beautiful in color, and Santa looks better in red!\n",
      "When I was little and watched this movie no one could tell me that Santa  was not true when he sang to that little girl in Dutch it made me so excited it took my breath away that's the magic that all children rich or poor should grow up with, even poor my parents always kept the magic alive for as long as they where with us.\n",
      "You can choose b/w or the color version.  The story is timeless.The clothes are great and the character actors are perfect.\n",
      "All the purist noise about \"the abomination of colorization\" notwithstanding, I bought this one FOR that version--I already have the b&w-only; version, so since this repackaging also includes that one as well, I guess I now have a duplicate. In the colorized version, it looks like they overcompensated with the software to avoid making colors too garish, so Edmund Gwenn's Santa suit isn't very red. Plus, the taxicabs you see in the beginning as an out-of-uniform Kringle walks down Fifth Avenue aren't the bright school-bus-yellow you expect on a cab. But we do get to see a green Christmas tree with colored ornaments in the scene towards the end at the Senior home. And when Kringle tries to blow bubbles with the bubblegum he \"mooches\" off Susan, we get to see the resulting pink shreds in his beard. I guess bubblegum was pink as far back as right after World War II. One scene that was only in the book until I watched the \"third version\"--the 20th Century Fox 46-minute TV special tucked away in the extras on disc 2--and saw it there. That's the humorous scene where mean-spirited intellectual snob psychologist Sawyer gives a \"debunking-Santa\" lecture, all the while Kringle is peeking around corners and making ironic faces as the audience breaks up laughing and Sawyer doesn't even know he's there. I know that the above evidence as \"pro\" arguments seem flimsy up against the CSX freight train load of \"con\" arguments from anti-colorization purists/ naysayers, but reality check, time out--the colorized version is AVAILABLE, I BOUGHT it and in our society, that's all the justification I need. I'm a CUSTOMER, a VIEWER--part of the AUDIENCE, capisce? In entertainment, non-fans, \"boo birds\", haters and other naysayers don't matter--the REAL AUDIENCE does.Other reviewers have dealt with the principal actors Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Edmund Gwenn and child actress Natalie Wood as well or better than I could, so it's pointless for me to duplicate their efforts. But one supporting player--William Frawley as Judge Harper's political advisor whose cigar is a multi-purpose prop--is a familiar face to me. Part of my childhood TV viewing included \"I Love Lucy\", with Frawley co-starring as Lucy and Ricky's downstairs landlord Fred Mertz. I'm sure when Frawley played the Judge's advisor in this film, he never envisioned tenants \"entertaining\" him with live band versions coming from upstairs of \"The Mexican Hat Dance\", re-badged \"El Breako the Leaso\" a handful of years later.\n",
      "It's that guy that plays the Santa Claus that does...Oh, the young Natalie Woods is certainly a strong impact also...I've seen a play, I've seen the copies...this is the one to get...THIS Santa Claus has a sense of magic about him...a Godly presence in his acting....I loved it this Christmas as much as I did when I was a kid....maybe more.\n",
      "This movie is a classic and great one to add to my collection.  Arrived before the holiday so I could enjoy the evening to myself watching all the classic Christmas movies.\n",
      "I don't know anyone who doesn't love this movie.  The (Blu-ray) version is a marvel of clarity and crispness.  The depth is remarkable.  We watch it every year and always enjoy it.\n",
      "Wonderfully nostalgic...I remember Macy's AND Gimbel's from my youth.A perfect Holiday \"Pick-me-up\"...My children and I look forward to our annual viewing!\n",
      "The wife and I love the colorized version, my Mom is in love withthe original B/W, now I can make em both happy, a great classic!\n",
      "My brother and I watched this movie as kids. It became the perfect gift for Christmas. We remember it in black & white...but the colorized version doesn't change the message.\n",
      "For the Woody Allen Fans. As Woody prefer everything in B/W. It great in colorized color. Give it a freshness and this is a special pack with other feature. It work the money.\n",
      "I bought this for a friend who could watch this movie non-stop forever. She was very pleased with it. yippee\n",
      "Delightful Christmas fantasy of a charming old man who believes he is Santa Claus, and the wonderful change he brings to the people around him.  This perennial holiday classic is on many short-lists of the all time great Christmas movies.  The film just oozes with warm-hearted humor.  Very young Natalie Wood sparkles as Susan, who learns to stop being so grown up, and enjoy childhood, with all its wide-eyed wonder.  Edmund Gwenn plays Kris Kringle, and lives the role.  He totally connects with the kiddies who visit \"Santa\" at Macy's department store.  The brief scene with the little Dutch refugee girl is a definite emotional high point in this movie.  The combined reaction of relief and wonder in the child's face as she visits Santa and finds he speaks her language is memorable.  Gene Lockhart as the harried judge, and William Frawley as his street-wise political advisor provide the needed comic relief to keep the court-room segments from becoming too overwhelmed by lawyers and their tactics.  Even Jack Albertson shows up as an ingenious postal clerk who helps Kringle solve his legal problem.  The on-location scenes filmed on the streets of New York assist the viewer in suspending disbelief.  An enthusiastic cast, crisp direction by George Seaton, a sentimental holiday message, and great humor make this movie a solid holiday treat for the entire family.  Multiple viewing only enriches the rewards.  Beware remakes!  ;-)\n",
      "I prefer the original black and white version of this film but the colored version makes for a nice change on occasion. This particular package has both versions, as well as a number of extra features that the Blu-Ray doesn't offer, which is why I purchased this package. This film is on the same level as It's A Wonderful Life in that no matter how many times you've seen it, you look forward to seeing it again because it is a classic. I highly recommend Miracle on 34th Street regardless of what version you prefer.\n",
      "If you are reading this review you likely already know and love this classic movie. Since I grew up with this version, I do prefer it to the newest remake although that one is well done, too. In any case, if you have never seen this one just save yourself some time, stop reading this, and buy it!What you are probably interested in is the quality of the blu-ray. I have seen this movie many times on TV and on prior DVD release and this blu-ray is certainly the best presentation I have seen. That said, it did not \"blow me away\" the way the remaster ofIt's a Wonderful Life [Blu-ray] did. The picture just looks a little bit muted with whites not quite white and the whole picture just tending toward being a bit dark. The level of detail also does not match what I have seen on other blu-rays.I did some searching on the internet and on blu-ray.com did confirm that this is a new scan in HD since I was not even certain of that by watching it - and that site also noted limitations might well be related to the source material - and that is likely the case. I did not have a chance to compare it to a prior DVD - I'll be honest, I couldn't find it! As my wife would/will say, time to tidy up and organize DVDs! if I locate the DVD I'll compare directly and post an update.It is important to note this film is presented in the correct aspect ratio - this means that if you watch it on a wide screen TV then black bars at the sides are present which are normal and proper. It is also notable that the colorized version is NOT included if that was of interest to you. Prior reviewers were very upset about that but as of this writing the currently shipping case does not claim that a colorized version is included and the Amazon listing appears to have been updated as well.All in all though I am not awestruck by this disc it still gets 5 stars as a wonderful classic movie and likely the best transfer possible from limited source material. I am looking forward to sharing it with my 5 and 7 year old kids!\n",
      "For years I started watching this before Thanksgiving with Our 2 kids.This year I bought copies for Our kids for Christmas,they arrived today 12-17-13,They are married and in their 30's.Perfect movie to watch and get in the spirit,it kicks off the holiday season.\n",
      "\"MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET\" is the closest thing to a christmas classic you will ever see on this planet. I loved it when I saw it. Edmund Gwenn is PERFECT as Santa. In fact, I think this film is a great classic. If you're ever stuck with absolutely NOTHING to do one wintery-like, and a very low temperatured day, and you are inside with no fire goin' in a fireplace, watch this. And to remember something useful for a review like this, read the title of this review a second time. I don't have experience, but I'm sure it works if you love christmas.\n",
      "This has always been one of my favorite Christmas movies.  I am trying to replace all of my VHS wiih DVD's.\n",
      "Excellent movie in both it's colored and black and white versions. A very traditional movie to watch every year. It shows how a young girl is led to believe by her mother that there is no such thing as Santa Clause. The girl and the mother eventually find out the true meaning of Christmas with the help of a old gentleman claiming to be Santa Clause and the laywer next door.The movie shows how us that even then and now how much Christmas is commercialized and takes away from the true meaning of Christmas. In the gift of love to family,friends and loved ones,and the exchanging of gifts. A feel good movie though in excellent respects for the young and old to watch. The remake is good too in it's own.\n",
      "Love this movie. Purchased it for my Christmas collection!\n",
      "This movie is a tradition for those who have viewed it and can enjoy theinnocence of it's message. Embracing the joy of being a child with animagination and the anticipation of that imagination coming tolife at Christmas.  Whether you believe in Santa or not the truth of letting a childbe a child is important.\n",
      "How to play an exemplary Santa (Edmund Gwenn, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar). Natalie Wood before she grew up.\n",
      "Having many holiday seasons watched or tried to find it on the seasonal plays on the tele, chose to purchase our own copy.The storyline is solid and acting is good for the times.  The integrity of Kringle and Doris and Susan (can you say Natalie Wood! how neat!)et al is very good.  It makes for great viewing.  Neat really to go back and understand the cultural climate at its making.  Very much more wholesome attitude going on here.The psychogist (William Frawley) is excellent as well.  The miracle of the story is fantassy alright, but this is its charm and the charm of the times --- not our nowadays stuckness on blood and guts and supercreatures, etc.  Kids as they get older certainly can be exposed to the truth about Nick, but when younger, this can be a fun time for their rising imagination.Thoroughly enjoyable.\n",
      "a wonderfull timeless classic for the whole family to watch and enjoy together;so sit back break out the popcorn and enjoy\n",
      "A Christmas tradition for us.  We like to run the gamut, so it is 'Miracle', 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation', and 'A Christmas Story'  (\"You'll shoot your eye out kid.\").\n",
      "It was always a tradition between my brother and I to watch \"Miracle on 34th Street\" on Thanksgiving Day, in order to officially kick off the holiday season.  I was on my own this Thanksgiving (out of town on work) and was not able to purchase or rent a copy of this classic movie before Thanksgiving Day itself.  Fortunately for me, Amazon had this wonderful \"on demand\" service available, and I was able to rent and watch it immediately for just $2.99.  Thanks, Amazon, for allowing me to observe a long-time tradition, and making me feel a little closer to home on Thanksgiving!\n",
      "A classic holiday movie like this is a nice addition for those who celebrate Christmas. We watch is every year and always look forward to it.\n",
      "This is really an excellent movie...It really underscores the meaning of Christmas...I have given excerpts to many family members...It will be in my group of all-time Christmas favorites...Great that it's in DVD format...\n",
      "Very good movie to watch at any time.  My family and I enjoyed it again this year and we will have it to watch whenever we want.\n",
      "Great movie and always a classic and the old VCR copy broke so needed a new DVD set to see\n",
      "It's a classic that cannot be beat!!! Not a huge fan of the newer version... always make my way back to this classic.\n",
      "The Mircle on 34th Street.This is the only version to watch.  Yes, Santa does exist.This is a true classic to watch every Christmas.\n",
      "For anyone who ever experienced the joys of Christmas anywhere, specifically in the wonderment and magic of Santa Claus, and all that he represents, this movie delivers the goods in a major way.  I love the way  this movie has aged -- its black and white New York, with a Macy's that you  can practically smell, paint a quaint, innocent time, and populate that  time with characters that still have a contemporary freshness to them --  Maureen O'Hara, who is deliciously self-aware, tells her little girl there  are no such things as fairy tales -- having a bitter heart from a man who  has obviously abandoned her.  It is her heart, and little Natalie Wood's  (who is amazingly precocious and adorable) that Edmund Gwynn must melt by  the time Christmas Eve rolls around.  The simplest of plots, with a lovely  cornball quality, tumbles forth with warmth and amusement.  And it is again  the things we do not see but imagine -- as when Kris tells Maureen outside  of Macy's, the 34th Street sign hovering above them -- that he must be on  his way; it is Christmas Eve after all -- that give it a special layer of  Christmas fantasy.  I dearly love this movie, and virtually every remake  pales in comparison.  Gwynn will make you believe -- he justifiably won the  Oscar playing Kris Kringle.\n",
      "This movie is a Christmas classic and no matter how many times I see it I never tire of it.  You don't find movies like this anymore.\n",
      "Not sure, but believe this was the young Natalie Wood's first acting job. She's adorable and Maureen O'Hara (normally of the John Wayne counterpart roles), is wonderful as the disbelieving mother whose heart and mind slowly opens to love, possibility, miracles and goodness. There's a modern version too (think it was made in the 1990s) but this is simpler and well done. Nothing you wouldn't want your child to see. If anything, it will help them believe in Santa as a possibility a bit longer. Good for all- heart warming.\n",
      "Love this movie recommend this as a Christmas gift to share with friends or your nieces ,matthew or even u kids they well love it\n",
      "The one I bought had both color and black and white versions, and it is so beautiful.  Clarity.This is THE CLASSIC. Years ago I had the opportunity to hear the radio show they broadcast just before the movie came out.Just a deep appreciation.\n",
      "A CHRISTMAS SPECIAL THAT EVERYONE ENJOYS. THE ORIGINAL MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET WAS ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL. MY NEICES AND NEPHEWS LOVED IT.\n",
      "OK - Let's face it ! Natalie Wood and Maureen O'Hara are two of my favorite actresses. This portrayal of Santa is the absolute best and lets face it. Only the Post Office has the clout to prove he is for real and not imaginary. How long have we had the Macys Thanksgiving Day parade. This one is my favorite of all the different versions out there and this Blu-ray version is so much better than my VHS copy.\n",
      "Cannot help but love this movie...great memories...sent to my niece's family for their family Christmas celebration and tradition...great  never fails to deliver\n",
      "Truly a classic I watch every year!! It brings out the little girl in me! A must see for all ages!\n",
      "Many years ago I was working at Macy's over the Christmas holidays.  I was stationed near the gift wrapping area where this film was on continuous loop.  I must have seen certain scenes from it 70 times.  I can still hear the young janitor advising Chris to \"Throw it on the floor - I get awfully tired of sweeping up dust.\"  At the end of the holiday season, I had to aquire the film in order to watch it all the way through.  And we still watch it every year.\n",
      "Can't let a Christmas go by without watching it. The unexplained nature of the miracle is what makes it timeless.\n",
      "great movie ! love the black/white version .  takes me back to my childhood in the 50's. a christmas classic.\n",
      "classic movie.  like actors.  maureen o'hara still alive.  knew john payne and his first daughter, julie.  went to school with julie from 7th grade to graduation from high school.\n",
      "This was exactly what I expected. Brand new and excellent quality. It also arrived much faster than expected. I would definitely buy from this seller again.\n",
      "Fun to introduce the kid to a wholesome film I enjoyed in my youth - can't go wrong with this one.\n",
      "Probably the best-loved Christmas film classic for children ever made.  As Santa himself, Edmund Gwenn gives his  beautiful Oscar - winning portrayal while John Payne and Maureen O'Hara are fine in their roles......... The actual Kris Kringle is hired as Santa for the Macy's Thanksgiving parade but finds difficulty in proving himself to the cynical parade sponsor. When the boss's daughter also refuses to acknowledge Kringle, he goes to extraordinary lengths to convince her. A holiday classic equal in classic status to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE with Gwenn and Wood especially engaging.  On his deathbed, actor Gwenn was asked \"is dying hard?\" His reply? \"No. dying is easy.  Comedy is hard\".\n",
      "This is a timeless Christmas classic. It may appear \"old\" to some, but should be viewed by each generation of kids and adults alike.\n",
      "This is the best ending of all of the versions of this movies.  The post office department has restored faith in us all that the Santa does exist.\n",
      "This movie is a must every year. I never get tired of it a must watch! This DVD was worth the price\n",
      "Superb acting by the entire cast, this 1947 movie is the definitive version of this heart-warming but never saccharine story.\n",
      "This DVD has both the colored version and the original black and white. Great bonus features. If you enjoy fun movies this is for you.\n",
      "The movie itself is one of the all time classic family Christmas movies and should not be missed.I am, however, very disappointed that Amazon has not seen fit to tell the buyer whether or not this film is restored or remastered. They continue to list these movies with minimal information, even after repeated complaints to their \"help\" center. Come on Amazon....provide the proper information so we can decide if this really is a \"new\" version or simply one that has been \"repackaged\".........we DESERVE more info if you expect us to spend our money.....!!!\n",
      "This is one of the best holiday movies ever. The original is an absolute must watch for anyone with kids and even without. My family  watches this movie every Christmas without fail. The acting was super and the storyline is great. I highly recommend this movie.\n",
      "Always loved this movie and glad to have it on a  more permanant medium.  One movie you want to keep for viewing.\n",
      "Great classic movie\n",
      "This is an awesome movie shown in black and white. Brought back so many great childhood memories. Definitely a must buy!\n",
      "This movie deserves the Oscar for best original screen play.  It is warm and funny with just enough villainy to make believers out of all of us.  You never know when Santa (or an angel) has been sent to help you muddle through some of your most oppressive problems.  The storyline was spot on.  The acting was first rate and I love the Macy's parade scenes (just to remind us that some things never really change).  We watch this movie every Thanksgiving when the turkey coma sets in.  It is a warm and wonderful tradition that ushers in the Christmas season.\n",
      "This movie is one of my favorite and I look through the TV programs each Christmas Holiday Season so I can see this movie.  I decided to purchase the movie and I am so glad that I did.  I highly recommend this movie to be added to your movie collection to be watched over and over.\n",
      "Watching this movie brings back memories of Christmas Eve at grandma's house. I haven't seen the movie in years. My grandma went to Heaven this year and I felt this was a perfect time to get back in the tradition.\n",
      "Wonderful movie! Came in excellent condition! My favorite movie ! Best version ever made! My husband and I laugh every time we watch it.\n",
      "As I stated, another good one. I am not for remakes but this was actually a good one although the classic is still much better\n",
      "This dvd was purchased to replace my vhs version.  It is a good Christmas classic that I enjoy watching every December.\n",
      "One of my favorite holiday movies.  If you love Chistmas movies, this is one you will love and watch many times.\n",
      "This movie classic is always enjoyable! It is a wonderful story that was way ahead of its time. Fun for all!\n",
      "To me, having seen all the remakes , this is by far the best, the most believable, and the one. I wanted to own.\n",
      "This is one of the all-time favorites that I watch every Christmas season. For me, this black & white version is the best one. It is a story about goodness and faith with a little love story thrown in. Very schmaltzy but so easy to watch. We enjoy watching it every year and have been known to watch it more than once a season.\n",
      "How can you go wrong with this classic movie?  A must watch for me every holiday season. A great family movie.\n",
      "This has long been a favorite of many at Christmas time.  It is a great production.This timeless classic features Edmund Gwenn as Kris Kringle.  This kindly old man is employed to play Santa Claus at the Macy's department store in New York.  He creates quite a stir in the job and it is apparent that he really believes that he is Santa Claus.  Some who do not accept this identity seek to have him committed to a mental facility.There are some classic courtroom scenes with the presiding judge put in the untenable position of possibly ruling that Kringle is not really St. Nick.  He faces great unpopularity even with his own family members, let alone the voters.This is really a fun flick.  It is well done and has some great subplots.  Two well known actresses who play in it are Maureen O'Hara and a very young Natalie Wood.  If you have not seen it already, you will likely enjoy it.  If you have watched it before, this is one that can be pleasantly viewed again.\n",
      "This Colorized Version is Just Great. I had misplaced it before I had watched it. Just watched it a day or so ago.  Anyone who likes the black and white and the colorized. This is a great set.\n",
      "A Classic that never gets old or loses it's magic!Every sceen still applies and works in 2012 as it did in 1947.\n",
      "I have loved this movie since I was a child and I still have to watch it every year.  Still gives me shivers.  Natalie Wood is such an adorable child in this.  The whole cast is great.  You'll believe!!\n",
      "This is more of the \"Good Old Fashion\" story I like.  It has a good moral to it and the acting was supurb.\n",
      "The only drawback of this DVD is the colorized version.  Technicolor was available when this movie was made, but the director and producers chose not to use it.  Maybe there was a reason for that.Fortunately, the black and white version is here too- the better one.Here's a thought though.  Why is it that every time a person is presented in something other than a fantasy- as someone who believes himself to be Santa Claus- he's always shown as a mental patient?\n",
      "this edition came with 2 dvd's the black and white and also the color was a great price for both dvd's was a yuletide gift for my husband but a great movie night for the 2 of us.\n",
      "I love this movie, watch it every year. these are classic movie's that I enjoy watching. Real Christmas movie's that are great to watch.\n",
      "Packaged good and arrived early. I like the black and white version better, but is cool you can see how they looked in color as well\n",
      "After It's A Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street is probably the most popular of all the films shown around the Christmas season, and for good reason.  The story begins with the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City.  An exasperated Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) is the young Macy's executive in charge of the details of organizing the parade.  When the man hired to play Santa Claus on one of the parade floats turns up stone drunk, a kindly bearded gentleman (Edmund Gwenn) fills in as Santa, saving the day.  Gwenn's performance in the parade is so authentic, that Macy's offers him a job as their department store Santa, to the delight of both children and adults.  There's only one problem, Gwenn thinks he really is Kris Kringle, i.e., Santa Claus!  This \"dilemma\" presents serious problems for Mrs. Walker and her associate, Mr. Shellhammer (Philip Tonge), who realize what an asset and public relations ambassador Kris is for Macy's, but fear he may act out his \"latent maniacal tendencies\" as predicted by  quack store psychologist Mr. Sawyer (Porter Hall).  The plot thickens when apartment neighbor Fred Gailey (John Payne) takes notice of Mrs. Walker and her young daughter Susan (Natalie Wood).  A promising young attorney, Payne tries to win over first daughter Wood, before charming his way into O'Hara's life.  Due to a seemingly bitter divorce when Wood was a baby, O'Hara has shut down emotionally.  She refuses to let her daughter believe in any fantasies of any kind, including the childhood belief in Santa Claus.  It is her belief that parents must always be truthful with their children so they won't grow up to believe in fairy tale happy endings only to be disappointed by reality, which is revealed to be her own life experience.  Payne on the other hand thinks that it's a good thing for children to fantasize while they are young and to believe in fairy tales and the like...even to believe in Santa Claus.  This major difference of opinion when it comes to raising children becomes a real conflict for the two.  One thing leads to another and before you know it, Kris Kringle is on trial for lunacy with Payne defending him as the one and only Santa Claus.  Even though this film was released in 1947, its theme of believing in something larger than ourselves still holds true.  O'Hara's role as a working single mom is even more in tune with today's reality than in 1947.  She comes off as a competent, intelligent woman who is doing the best she can to raise her young daughter.  A wonderfully enchanting movie with great performances from all the players, but the real star is Edmund Gwenn in his Academy Award winning role as Kris Kringle.  His kind and gentle performance could convince anyone that he really is Santa Claus.  A young Natalie Wood also shines as O'Hara's daughter and her scenes with Gwenn are natural and real.  Filled with many memorable scenes (including  the first glimpse of the great character actress Thelma Ritter) including my favorite:  Kris speaking Dutch to a young war orphan who doesn't speak English while her adoptive mother looks on in amazement.  In addition to the Oscar won by Gwenn, Miracle won two additional statues for Best Original Story (Valentine Davies) and Best Screenplay (George Seaton).  Miracle on 34th Street deserves its well-earned reputation as a Christmas classic.\n",
      "I have about 10 must see movies between Thanksgiving and Christmas. This is top 2. Mr. Gwynn treats and talks with skeptics, believers and young Albert just the way I believe Santa should. I also play Santa to young children and this is a great story.\n",
      "This is a favorite for the entire family!!  The faith of a child overcomes the doubts of the adults in her life.\n",
      "Just a great feel-good Christmas movie of a bygone era.  To repeat an old phrase, \"They don't make 'em like  this anymore!\"\n",
      "It's Christmas Day as I am writing this review, so what better thing to do than to review one of the classic Christmas movies!  This is an emotional movie, pulling all the right strings to get the audience's predictable response.  And it works well!  This is, for what it's worth, in my judgment, the preferred Christmas movie.It has many different components that make the overall production work.  First, the cast.  The lead players are well portrayed, with John Payne as the idealistic attorney, Maureen O'Hara as the flinty, pragmatic non-nonsense mother of the \"too grown up for her age\" Natalie Wood, acting early in her career.  Other actors fill out the cast nicely, with William Frawley as a hard-boiled political operative to the judge, Gene Lockhart, who will preside over the court case that serves as the climax of the movie.Second, the plot line is crisply laid out and moves along nicely.  A drunk Santa Claus at Macy's is replaced by Edmund Gwenn, who calls himself Kris Kringle.  His behavior is at first thought harmful to the store--but redounds to Macy's benefit.  Then, he is accused of being mentally incompetent because of his belief that he is, in fact, Santa Claus. John Payne, who has become close to O'Hara's character, takes Kris Kringle's case to court.  There, the befuddled judge has to make some politically charged decisions.  Such as: Is there a real Santa Claus?  If so, is Kris him?  The US Post Office plays a key role in the outcome, and there is a happy ending--with a special nice touch, with the last lines being film classics.So, yes, there is a contrived element to this movie; yes, it pulls strings on the audience; yes, the ending is a bit schmaltzy.  But, yes, this is a wonderful movie and deserves to be telecast each holiday season.  A genuine classic!\n",
      "John Payne and Maureen O'Hara manage to prove that an old and bearded codger, Edmund Gwenn, who has been hired by Macy's Department Store in New York to play Santa Claus during the Christmas season, is actually Santa Claus, aka Kris Kringle. Natalie Wood is the skeptical little daughter of divorced O'Hara. Payne is a lawyer who works at a white shoe firm.This will warm the cockles of your heart. It ends happily, with Payne and O'Hara finding each other and Wood won over to a belief in Santa Claus, or at least the power of will.There are a few minor problems. I found out there was no Santa Claus early in life, around the age of thirty-five, when I took a look at my first paycheck. And later, when I tried to plead not guilty by reason of mental defect. And, as if that weren't enough, a few weeks into my marriage was enough to convince me. We might as well face head on the fact that life is full of pain. Every realist knows this. The doctor even slaps the newborn baby, except in the case of more than usually ugly babies when he slaps the mother.No. I'm afraid O'Hara and her daughter may have had the right take on life as materialists. Our lives are determined by our circumstances or, as the famous philosopher Brillat-Savarin put it, \"Dis-moi ce que tu manges, je te dirai ce que tu es.\" I don't know what it means but it sounds as if it had to do with some kind of material.Now, John Payne is a hoax of a different color. Unable to recognize an epiphenomenon when he sees one, he insists that fantasies are essential to our lives. He doesn't explain why. He just assumes it, with a snap of his mental fingers.He quits his job at a prestigious New York law firm in order to defend Santa Claus in court. Right. And where is John Payne now, you ask? I recently saw him wrapped in a couple of filthy blankets on a bench in Sheridan Square. Don't try to kid a kidder.Edmund Gwenn does a fine job in the role but he isn't Santa. Edmund Gwenn, as a matter of fact, is a psychopath who tried to push the innocent reporter Joel McCrea off the tower of a London church in \"Foreign Correspondent.\" Now he shows up as Santa Claus and we're asked to believe him? In this enshrinement of idealism, he sucks poor little Natalie Wood into his fantasy world of reindeer and North Poles and ritual reciprocity and all that. I won't deny that, fifteen years after this release, Natalie Wood began to play a part in my fantasy life too -- but what does that have to do with the venomous message this movie propounds? Nothing at all -- and let's get our minds out of the gutter, shall we?The lissotrichous Maureen O'Hara is attractive, polite but tough as carbon steel underneath all that winsome pulchritude. Well, maybe not so hard in the end. Maureen O'Hara might be spirited if the role called for it but never tough.\n",
      "we have quite a few Christmas movies that we rotate and watch each season, this is an old favorite I added to our collection.\n",
      "Almost everyone has seen this movie before but our church had used this show as a basis for a new sermon series about the movies of Christmas and faith. I really enjoyed watching it again and thinking about \"the lovely intangibles\" of life. Very deep movie when you look beneath the surface.\n",
      "Love the movie !! One of my Christmas favorites!! Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it has been colorized. I feel it loses something in the translation. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.\n",
      "One of the greatest Christmas classics of all time.The true spirit of Christmas and of what Santa Claus really means.Yes, Virginia, THERE IS A SANTA CLAUS.And you can see him here.\n",

      "I won't even entertain the idea of watching a remake of this classic.  My husband and I watch it throughout the holidays one of our family traditions.  Our holidays wouldn't be complete without watching this wonderful story.\n",

      "This is a Timeless film.  My family will be watching it 100 years from now.There are some things to go in a time capsule for future generations.This is what I have put in mine.\n",
      "This is another classic movie of which I have more than one version. I do enjoy this version's \"Kris Kringle\" very much and Natalie Wood was fantastic as Susan. Maureen O'Hara made a great mother and the story speaks for itself, if you believe. . . .\n",
      "One of my absolute Christmas movies of all time.  Of all the versions of this story available, the original (1947) is the best, starring Natalie Wood, Maureen O'Hara, and Edmund Gwynne.\n",
      "I love this movie!  And I was surprised this package included both color version and black and white version.  Good job.\n",
      "This is a true classic.  I prefer it over the newer one.  The cast is awesome!  I love truly love it!\n",
      "This is my favorite version of Miracle on 34th Street. It brings back a lot of memories form my childhood. I would highly recommend it.\n",

Whether in black and white or colorized, this is an enjoyable movie to watch with the whole family. The storyline, acting and setting of the movie can never be duplicated. It is a smart well crafted movie that will \"tug at the heart strings\". It is a must to see and if there is anyone out there that hasn't seen this movie (???), do yourself a favor and rent, Netflix and, better yet, purchase the movie to have for your own video library.\n",
      "If you haven't seen Miracle of 34th Street, you're missing lots of happiness to be had during Christmas time. Such a great story that carries through so many different generations. I've watched this with my parents and grandparents since I was a kid, and will definitely watch it with my children someday!\n",
      "I am a \"baby-boomer.\"  This classic movie takes me back to fond memories of my family's tradition of watching it on TV at Christmastime when I was a child.  But this is a wonderful heart-warming family movie for any generation.  I was very happy to be able to purchase this movie inexpensively online and watch it immediately.

      "We watch this movie every year at Christmas. We only had it on VHS, so it was nice being able to rent it on Christmas Day. Recommend it to everyone.\n",
      "This is a great Christmas movie for Santa Clause.  Always remember though that Jesus Christ's birthday is the reason for Christmas\n",
      "Always a favorite!!!! Perfect for the family....no worries for the kids in the room.  Its a long standing favorite for a good reason.\n",
      "the movie is an all time classic i am most happy with it and found it to be in good condition when i received it\n",

      "Having grown up in the era of the movie, I love reminiscing.  I recommend this movie to all who love nostalgia and feeling like a kid again.\n",
      "Good old fashion black & white movie with a good story line. My family and I watched this movie and we all had a grand time answering questions from our preteen grandkids about Santa Claus. What I liked most about this movie is that it brought three generations of my family closer together.\n",
      "This is timeless.  Great quality.  Appropriate for all in the family.  We watch every holiday season and it never seems to get old.\n",

      "I purchased this DVD set for my daughter for x-mas. This classic is one of our family favorites! It has everything in it; romance, drama, comedy, and adventure. I personally prefer this 1947 version over the newer one. Good, clean entertainment for the entire family.\n",
      "This is one of the christmas classics that I have always loved. When my daughter said that her kids had never seen this movie I decided to get the movie for them as a gift.It was perfect and when they had seen the movie the kids wanted to see it again. I'm 71 and I still love Christmas and if there were no Santa Clause then I'd find a way to invent him.\n",
      "Valentine Davies' story comes to life in one of the best Christmas films Hollywood ever produced.  Edmund Gwenn  earned his Best Supporting Oscar (he should have been nominated for a \"Leading\" role) as the quintessential Kris Kringle.  Natalie Wood showed her immense talent in this classic and Maureen O'Hara shone, as usual, as the no-nonsense manager and mom who hired Kris to instill the true spirit of Christmas in the cold heart of retail.\n",
      "Very few motion pictures of days long past can command the attentionof current viewers. We have phenomenal acting, great special effects, wonderful directing, breathtaking color and so much more. Here is one. The acting is great for it's time, the directing is good and the story is timeless. It is one of the few movies I want for my permanent collection\n",
      "What can you say about a classic.  It is a classic that can be seen every holiday season and enjoyed.\n",
      "My mother's favorite Christmas movie was It's A Wonderful Life. Mine was the original Miracle on 34th Street; and it still is. Maybe because it takes me back to that time when I was that age of 7, 8, & 9 and had all my dreams in front of me. . . when I so wanted to believe in things like Santa Claus. Unlike the remake, the original has a superb cast of actors demonstrating outstanding craftsmanship. So if you haven't seen the original, treat yourself and pick up this gem for your holiday or classics collection.\n",
      "Instead of renting I decided to purchase this classic movie. I had never seen it but knew it had to be good to be around for so long. I started a new tradition by watching this with family on the night before Christmas Eve. Such a touching movie. LOVE that it came in black and white and a color version.\n",
      "Had this movie on tape have loved it for years a true classic everyone is great in it is a true classic\n",
      "I love this movie and wanted to get the 65th anniversary edition and I am so glad I did. It has both the B/W and color versions. I have not watched it however, there is more on these two discs than just the movie so I'm anxious to see what else is there to view.\n",
      "Love this movie. Ordered it using my prime free trial account and had it in less than 2 days, not to mention it was also offered as an instant movie. Holiday classic, buy it!\n",
      "this is a wonderful original take on the movie version of the novel. It is a great movie, well done with fantastic sets & cinematography. The cast & crew are fantastic & the movie is very very entertaining.  they did a great job with the colorizing, but the B&W is just as much fun to watch & more nostalgic.  I got both =)\n",
      "A wonderful DVD set! The three versions (yes, three!) each have their own merits. The colorized version is reasonably vivid without being harsh on the eyes. The B&W version is a near-perfect restoration. The TV version is a nice bit of retro-media history. The interviews with Miss O'Hara are fascinating....boy, talk about someone who has aged so gracefully. The rest of the special features are a great insight into Hollywood history and studio marketing just before the beginning of the TV era. Well worth the tiny price.\n",
      "Young Natalie is a gas. Invokes memories of a simpler time.  Thankfully it was not colorized.Yes, I believe in Santa!\n",
      "Miracle on 34th Street is an all time favorite movie and glad I was able to purchase it...It's a keepsake!\n",
      "Quality and price were both exceptional! A lovable, timeless classic my family and I always enjoy year after year.  A perfect way to kick off the holiday season!\n",
      "You will be very pleased with this classic movie...especially with no commercials!  It has two discs included one in the original black and white and a version in color. It was well packaged and shipped promptly.  I would highly recommend ordering this for the next holiday season or give as a gift during the year.  Enjoy!\n",
      "This version has both the original black and white version and the colorized version. Watching the black and white is an annual event(s). Love it!\n",
      "I first saw this film when I was aged 12, 38 years ago, and loved the story.  I finally decided to get this, but am perplexed as to why the extra colourised version was ever considered.  Of course I won't watch that disc because it is a crime to do that to films of that era, or for that matter to edit any work of film or animation from its original presented form.  This is why I won't buy any of the animated Christmas shows from the 60's, Rudolph, Grinch, etc.  I've heard too many things about how/what has been removed.  It is nice that \"Miracle on 34th Street\" is as complete as I remember, and as far as I know.  The extras on this DVD are quite nice as well.  The rest speaks for itself.  Wonderful.\n",
      "I love this movie and always have...it kind of gets you into the 'Spirit of Christmas'. I remember watching it as a girl and dreaming of Christmas morning.\n",
      "I wanted this in the original B & W and only the colorized versions were available in stores I looked at this season.  Glad to have gotten it without any delay or issues.  Good service, good film!\n",
      "This was a double treat because it has two versions, one color and one B&W.  What more is there to say about this classic.\n",
      "Excellent!  One of my all-time favorites.  I recommend it to every one.  It was also delivered right on the date specified.\n",
      "I have loved this movie since I was a little girl. I still enjoy seeing it every year. There is a lot of joy in this movie.\n",
      "A wonderful Christmas classic at an phenomenal price! We bought up about a dozen of these and gifted them to everyone for Christmas one year with some gourmet hot chocolate, monogrammed mugs and a comfy warm blanket!\n",
      "Miracle on 34th Street has been remade several times, but this remake is the best.  Chris Cringle, Santa, makes one believe again.  His scene with the bubble gum makes me chuckle. Natile Wood's performance is outstanding.  The scene where she pretends to be a monkey is cute. And who could not love' Maurine O'Hara's performance as the mother.  At my house if you don't wait this movie it just isn't Christmas.\n",
      "Great for the whole family.  It's a movie that can be watched every Christmas with it's message of hope and faith.\n",
      "The Most Beloved Holiday Film of all Time is now on a Two Disc Special Edition for this Holiday season. The Film that begged the question: Do you believe in Santa Claus?

      "The story is, of course a \"feel good\" Christmas classic. I had an old B&W; copy that was damaged. I chose the colorized version for a change. To my delight the package included the original B&W; and several other features. A real surprise Christmas gift for me and my family. The colorization is very well done.DrBill\n",

      "We have always loved the story.  This blue ray edition adds great detail and clarity to one of our favorite holiday movies.\n",
      "With its clever, moving script and wonderful performances this remains the classic version of the tale of the department store Santa who maybe really is Santa--depending on your point of view. Edmund Gwenn is terrific as the old guy and the young Natalie Wood (who apparently really believed he was Santa during the filming) is the perfect little skeptic-turned believer. As well as the original black and white film this set includes the colorized version(forget that)and interesting background features, including an interview with Irish actress Maureen O'Hara, who played Natalie Wood's mother.\n",
      "I really liked the colorized version. It was very well done.Since it also has the B&W; version, you cah have your cake and eat it too!!\n",
      "i love the this movie it is a great family classic! it is a great all around christmas movie and family movie\n",
      "This movie is and old family favorite. I just purchased a new copy on BD for the grand kids.\n",
      "There are three Christmas movies That I consider \"essential\" (1947) at The Christmas holidays.  \"Miracle on 34th Street\" Is the first of these along with \"It's a wonderful life and almost any version of \"A Christmas carol\"  There are many others I like and watch.  However, these three always make me feel the gift of giving, love and peace in my heart.Miracle on 34th Street also reminds me that at one time when I was young people still cared about their fellow man if only at Christmas time.  It is my all time feel good movie.\n",
      "This is just a great movie\n",
      "This is just a Christmas tradition with me. I can't make it through the season without watching it (along with \"It's a Wonderful Life\"). Obviously how you will feel about it depends on you. For me this movie is tied to many fond memories. One thing for sure -- This version is much, much, much better than the remake!.\n",
      "A Christmas classic that will be replayed for years to come.  We bought this to replace the VHS version.  Fast shipper.\n",
      "This is a treasure of a movie to own. It's quality is exceptional a great find. I'm very pleased to own this DVD.\n",
      "I've always enjoyed this movie.  I'd rather hoped I was buying a DVD.  It was fun to watch on computer, but I don't own a Kindle or other such device.  Does Amazon sell the DVD?  Is there a way I can convert/download this \"owned\" movie to my own DVD disc?  Happy to learn how.\n",
      "I've watched this movie forever it seems and now have it in a colorized version that couldn't be better, unless the whole thing were to materialize in flesh and blood, bricks and mortar. In the colorized version, they've done it in a sepia tone/color effect that closely approximates the tones used in graduation photos during the 50s when I graduated and, therefore, seems appropriate for the period.But for those purists who believe the original must be maintained, there's the black-and-white version to satisfy their preferences. My approach to that argument is black-and-white may have been chosen to suit a budget but we see in color, so why not have it that way if possible. Granted, some movies are shot in black-and-white to instill a mood; Citizen Kane and Psycho come to mind. But Kafka was shot in both in different places to achieve the desired effect.Whichever, I wholeheartedly endorse this combination presentation. Well done.\n",
      "I'm not an artsy crafty type person, and I own several old black and white movies that have been colorized. But please, if you (the studio) are not going to bother doing a decent job of colorizing, then DON'T!Luckily of course, this special edition has the original B&W; version, which is what we all remember and love.\n",
      "The characters and story fidelity are superb in the 1947 movie!  The 1994 version pales in comparison.\n",
      "My family and I have made a tradition of watching this movie every Christmas Eve on cable, now I can add it to my collection of favorite movies.\n",
      "i have seen this movie so many times. it one of those you never get tired of. even though the flim was made in the 40s it does not feel dated any.\n",
      "This is a classic. What can I say. The movie is charming,, and says all the right things about Christmas. My family loves it, and so do I. Of course as for Amazon The mechandise is top notch!\n",
      "Like many households, for me Christmas movies are as much a part of the tradition as trees and presents.  \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" \"White Christmas,\" \"A Christmas Carol\" the Rankin/Bass Animagics and \"Miracle on 34th Street.\"  This Holiday classic is a nice DVD, with good quality and restored black and white.  The bonus features are slim to none, containing only a movie trailer and a talent file.With Ed Gwen and Natalie Woods playing both sides of the coin, \"Miracle on 34th Street\" is a film of charming, wide-eyed cynicism.  What place does Santa Claus have in the modern world?  What place does belief and trust have in a world where Santa shows up to work drunk and Christmas is a headache to every retail and postal worker in America?Gimbels may be long gone, but I am glad that \"Miracle on 34th Street\" has persisted.  Perhaps the message of the film has more staying power than the corporations that would commandeer Christmas.Like Mr. Macy says, \"You cannot argue with success.\"\n",
      "Cannot wait until Christmas for my Mom to watch this movie. Her absolute FAVORITE Christmas Movie. We had the VHS but it eventually tore up from us constantly playing it. (:\n",
      "Uncle Eddy and Clark W. Griswald are back in National Lampoom's Christmas Vacation. I personally think this one is the best of all the Lampoom's movies. Clark and his family are preparing for a great Christmas together with their parents when Uncle Eddy and his family unexpectantly arrive. From their everything goes downhill for Clark. (again) Hilarious movie, but does unfortunately have some language to it. (I won't write any examples) But overall this movie is one of the funniest I have ever seen. I highly recommend it for any National Lampoom fan!\n",
      "This is a great movie.  It arrived new and undamaged.  I would recommend this show to anyone who like to laugh.\n",
      "Classic, that's all I got to say.  Uhmm, if you havn't seen this movie, you need to watch it.\" I don't KNOW, Margo!\"\n",
      "Absolutely love this movie - very funny and entertaining. Great cast and plot. Arrived fast and well packaged. Classic christmas movie.\n",
      "we rented this the quality was great they have improved the streaming since last year,the movie still makes us laugh every year a must watch for Christmas.\n",
      "Our family's favorite Christmas movie for over 20 years.  This movie is just great fun and a perfect reward after tree trimming, popcorn and true quality family time for much laughter.\n",
      "I've loved this movie since it's release in 1989 and recently decided to replace my DVD version with Blu-Ray. It is a yearly family tradition to watch it. There is side splitting laughter accompanied by lots of holiday traditions with a twist. Chevy Chase as well as all the other actors turn in all star performances.\n",
      "I never get tired of watching this movie every Christmas! Easily Chevy Chase's finest (all of the Vacation movies). Decided to grab this Blu Ray to add to my collection.\n",
      "Love this movie! Everyone should own this movie. It is a classic and we watch it every Christmas. You should watch it.\n",
      "This is a classic. You have to watch it at least once a year! I don't watch any of the other National Lampoon movies as much as this one. So happy to finally have my own copy so I don't have to wait or see commercials.\n",
      "While not the same type of classic as Miracle on 34th Street or It's a Life, Christmas Vacation is a good, silly holiday comedy. It's good for a once a year viewing.\n",
      "Look for ward to seeing this movie every year, its not Christmas unless I get to see this movie, so funny!\n",
      "This movie is a regular at our house come the holiday season. I have always enjoyed the Vacation series and this is one of my favorites. I am glad it has staying power and is aired regularly and available for streaming even today. The film is not a side splitter but offers some light hearted laughs and is very relatable for adults with in-laws, children and annoying neighbors.\n",
      "Like myself, I know many people in their 30's and this is the movie we must watch every Christmas. Funny, memorable....classic. So many funny lines, several we quote all year round! Go see it now if you haven't.\n",
      "I love this movie I think it will go down as a classic holiday movie. Lots of laughs and family fun.\n",
      "Item was just what I wanted. Great price for the used dvd and was fun to watch over the Christmas holiday.\n",
      "This movie was so hard to get my hands on here in Australia, and i love this movie, just perfect for the family to sit ans watch any time of the year, and the postage was great ..\n",
      "Now I doubt many of you who read this review have not seen this movie.  I also would think many of you who have watched it probably have it on DVD.  So let me save some people from having to read on.  If you have this movie on DVD should you buy it? Probably not for $20 but if you have yet to get this movie the Blu-ray option is an excellent choice.The story features all the favorite actors like Chevy Chase, Beverly DiAngelo and Randy Quaid.  Clark Griswald played by Chevy Chase just wants to have a normal traditional Christmas.  Of course when it's a National Lampoons Christmas everything is far from ordinary.  The comedy in this movie is non-stop.  From the crazy antics of Clark to Randy Quaids outstanding outlandish performance as the red neck with his crazy family.Now as many have rated the Blu-ray version I am here to say it really looks decent.  Not excellent.  The picture is clear and much improved from the DVD version.  The sound is decent and played thru all my five speakers.  Like I said earlier if you already have this on DVD your best bet is to stick with it.  Otherwise this is a great addition to anyones Christmas collection.\n",
      "It would not be Christmas without watching this with the whole family.  Great for all ages and appropriate for the decor\n",
      "This is a must see every year, so I'm glad that I was able to get it right before the holidays.\n",
      "I have seen this movie many times and also seen it in the theater when It was first released.  This will always be a classic and almost everyone can relate to it because we have all been there.  We build things up in our heads and somehow we are disappointed.  From the opening scenes of picking out the Christmas tree to the flying Santa at the end, this movie is just simply funny.\n",
      "Best Christmas Movie ever! It truly is \"the gift that keeps on giving the whole year!\" I watch it all year long!\n",
      "I gave this five stars because this movie is amazing. Shipped quickly and exactly as described. Would highly reccommend to anyone looking for a laugh.\n",
      "Classic love watching this movie at Christmas!!! Thank you amazon for access almost anywhere! Funny movie and brings the family together.\n",
      "Funny, quirky movie about a goofy family.  Watched it all growing up and it's still funny as heck.  The best of the National Lampoon's Vacation movies, by far.\n",
      "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is one of my favorite holiday films. Clark, Ellen, Rusty, Audrey, and Cousin Eddie are back but this is nothing like the disapointing sequel, European Vacation (that movie was awful), this time the Griswold's decide to stay home and celebrate Christmas the good old fashioned-way. Both of their parents arrive and unexpected guest causes mayhem for The Griswold's, yikes! Cousin Eddie, played geniusly by Randy Quaid. The last hour of the film is non-stop laughs. The perfect holiday movie, I highly recommend the yultide gathering of mishaps and complete fun.\n",
      "This movie is just plain SILLY. I had to buy it because at Christmas time, I love watching it, but sometimes miss when it's on TV. Simple solution, just own the DVD and watch it whenever.\n",
      "Hands down, this is the best Christmas movie ever. I upgraded to Blu-ray just to keep current.  If you haven't seen this movie you are missing out because it is hilarious.\n",
      "Greatest Xmas movie ever. Very funny and reminds me of Xmas with family while growing up. Something for everyone in this movie.\n",
      "I watch this movie all year long all though its probably most watched at Christmas time. Its just one of those movies that gets funnier each time I watch it.\n",
      "Our family loves this movie.  We watch it each holiday season and have for years.  We love the entire cast .... even Snot's!  We are in between pets but always joke that the next one will have that name:).\n",
      "This is a very funny movie one of the best in the series one of my personal favorites the bluray DVD looks better than the regular DVD this movie you watch all year round buy it on amazon you won't be sorry\n",
      "This is one of my all time favorite movies. Chevy Chase was at his best in here along with the rest of the cast. I laughed through the whole movie\n",
      "this is by far the best movie of all and it is my wifes favorite movie to watch she loves it\n",
      "It a great classic to see every holiday season.  The movies which makes everyone laugh and enjoy it greatly from young to the elders.\n",
      "If you have yet to see this movie, my advise would be to go out and rent it or better yet, buy it.  This instant classic will be one you'll watch every year for years to come.  Fun for the whole family!\n",
      "I appreciate all the National lampoon films; however, Christmas Vacation is in a class by itself.  I think it's Chevy Chase's best film (and I like Chevy Chase).  Like other veryu effective comedies, this one has hidden or subtle jokes that make it easy to watch over and over.  Apart from the big laughs that come at the expense of Clarke's brother in law, the tree falling into the neighbor's house and the black-out that results from Clarke's ambitious tree lighting set-up, I find the best moments when Clakrke loses his temper after discovering that his bonus has been revoked from the chain saw home improvements scene - would make Bob Vila proud - to the danny kaye exclamation.  The funniest, however, is when he re-arranges rudolph the reindeer after he can't get the lights on.  It's funny because it's very real.  how many of us - even as children - have gotten angry at inanimate objects for our mistakes?  remeber being frustrated at a mecano set or the lego piece that just would not fit?Unfortunately, nothing has surpassed this christmas comedy, and I can only think of one funnier movie: Dumb and Dumber.\n",
      "Quite simply put this is one of the MUST WATCH Christmas movies. If you have any sort of DVD/blu-ray collection, this is one of those MUST HAVES for your collection.Its a movie you can watch all year round! Kids to Adults will love this movie. They honestly just don't make comedies like this anymore. Its wholesome yet has plenty of \"adult\" humor in it to appeal to the masses.Christmas Vacation runs the gammet of emotions. Laughter to crying. There are even a few tense.. **Scary** moments. Like when the door bell rings and the family is at the door. Most of us can attest to the horrors of having family over for Christmas. And that first nock at the door or doorbell ring send a horrific chill through your spine. And though many of us dread certain family members, we forge ahead in the spirit of the season and tolerate the often UN-tolerable in our family.This movie is A+ in my book.\n",
      "Going to this movie was my parents first date, so for Christmas i tried to recreate their date and this movie was just what they needed\n",
      "This is a Christmas Classic! This will have the whole family laughing!!!! From the moment it starts till the movie ends you will be laughing your butt off!\n",
      "This movie is so funny I watch it any time of the year even if it isnt christmas! The family members that come over to there house are so funny. This movie is a classic and a must have!\n",
      "Christmas Vacation is a classic holiday movie.  Though a little raunchy at times, I could watch this movie over and over again.  This movie makes the viewer laugh non-stop, and is thoroughly enjoyable throughout.  Though I do not particularly like Randy Quaid's character, I do enjoy the acting of Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo.  I recommend this movie to anyone, anytime.\n",
      "If this isn't your favorite Christmas movie, there may be something wrong with you. Unless it's Home Alone.. then you're still cool.\n",
      "At any time will watch genius Chevy Chase movies. Thank you Mr Chase for all your work. How about one more National Lampoon's with you in it.\n",
      "come on it has Chevy Chase in it is good.  Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo have the family to come over to there house for Christmas.  but every thing goes wrong.  one of the best parts of the whole movie is the sled riding part of the movie.\n",
      "My favorite Chritmas show ever. Chevy and Randy are great in this movie. They keep you laughing with all the crazy happenings going on!\n",
      "We jujst love this and if you need to laugh thru the stress of the holiday's this film will take you there!\n",
      "This is definately one of the best Christmas movies ever made. All ages and genders can enjoy! Chevy Chase and Beverly DeAngelo made another great Vacation movie!!\n",
      "Always hilarious, each and every year! A little ronchy, maybe inappropriate for those under 10-13. Best national lampoons movie ever\n",
      "This is my families favorite movie It has become a tradition in our household to watch every year we find ourselves quoting the whole movie from  Clarks rant when he learns his bonus is a \"gift that keeps on giving the whole year\" or when when cousin Eddie keeps lamenting on about his \"recreational vehicle \" we are always looking for a way insert a quote from this awesome flick into every day life\n",
      "This is my most favorite movie every year for Christmas!  No matter how many times I have watch it over the years, I still laugh.\n",
      "This is truly a classic movie for the holidays one that van be watched year affer a year, a must for your holiday movie collection.\n",
      "My family and I Love this show. We have to watch it every year at Christmas. It is a tradition.\n",
      "As the title of my review suggests, I think that this is one of the funniest movies ever made.  I watch this every Christmas and it never gets old.  The writing and acting are just hilarious.  Chevy Chase is great and his meltdown has got to be one of the funniest moments in movie history.\n",
      "Classic. One of the best Christmas movies since Bing Crosby tap danced with Danny Kaye. I don't let a Christmas go by without watching this movie.\n",
      "I grew up watching this as did my whole family and now extended family, we used to quote and laugh every Christmas, i bought this for my favorite nephew and his new family so they could have one loll, his wife said he loved it and took it home after family Christmas and watched it immediately.  funny classic movie, and the little things in the tin were fun souvenirs  to have.\n",
      "One word,  \"CLASSIC\". And, since I have to add more words to review to get it published, add \"Trains, Planes and Automobiles\" to your HOLIDAY-MUST-SEE-LIST\n",
      "its a movie about the griswalds that have all of his wifes famil over form christmas. Elane from seinfeld has a part in the movie as there neighbors. if you like the other National lampoons movies the seris you will like this one.\n",
      "I always forget how great this movie is until I sit and watch it again.  It is back to back non stop great.\n",
      "I bought this movie because it's one of my favorite Christmas Movies and it comes in great on blu-ray. I bought it at a great price as well.\n",
      "Had this on VHS, the tape was getting very old and I was very happy to find it on DVD.\n",
      "This is typical Griswold fun that makes you see the elements of their life in your life (and your family)!  From a 100,000 tiny twinkle lights adorning the house, reflecting on great Christmas moments, being with family, and seeking the perfect holiday present.  Very funny and the more you watch it the funnier it gets!\n",
      "Haven't seen this movie in years--since I was a young teenager.  I think its even better the older you get.\n",

      "Love this movie, we watch it multiple times a year and its one of our default Christmas movies. Cousin Eddie is especially hilarious in this movie.\n",

      "This movie is a must see every Christmas.  My daughter loves to watch this movie and she laughs like crazy every time she watches it.\n",
      "We have spent many a Christmas with the Griswolds and never tire of their hilarious antics!  Our  favotite parts are \"The Icicle Scene\" and \"The Squirrel Scene\".  And that poor kitty cat!  This movie is fun for the whole family but be aware there is some adult humor that may not be too appropriate for younger kids. It's just not Christmas without the Griswolds!\n",
      "A Christmas classic, love it anytime of the year.  This has become a favorite Christmas Eve tradition at our house.\n",
      "A Christmas Classic. This is a must have for any Christmas movie collection.  Everyrime I watch this movie it's like the first time all over again.\n",
      "Checy Chase is a funny man. This is a VERY funny 80s-tastic movie that will make you feel much better about any holiday troubles that you may be having. I imagine that the writers wrote the initial story line and then sat around and said, \"Well, what else could go wrong? Let's add that in. Now let's one-up that.\" *writers laugh*Good for a holiday laugh, although it does have some swearing so I would not recommend it for young children.\n",
      "If i could give 5 more stars,it still wouldn't be enough.It 's our tradition to watch it every Christmas.A true classic!\n",
      "I have to watch this movie every single Christmas! although somewhat inappropriate It is one of the funniest Christmas movies around!\n",

      "I love this movie- and Christmas or not (and in any format) it's my all time favorite movie.  It hits home with everyone in one way or another, and it's soooo funny!  Chevy Chase is a genius- I wish he was in more movies.  Enjoy it- it's a great movie!!\n",
      "What better way to keep all those family members busy than watching this movie as a tradition?\n",
      "One of my favorite Christmas movies and my favorite of the Vacation Series. Chevy chase is great in this and the supporting cast is perfect.\n",
      "One of the funniest Christmas Movies I have ever seen!My main beef is that it is not available in Widescreen format. When is everyone going to get it that Widescreen will be the ONLY format one day, all DVD's should automatically have widescreen. End of Discussion!\n",
      "Classic comedy to start off the holiday season. Perfect way to kick off the busy holiday season with side splitting humor.\n",
      "I looked everywhere for this DVD over the Christmas season and finally purchased it on Amazon. What can I say? It's a classic. Shipping was fast and the price was reasonable.\n",
      "This movie is full of great quotes and just perfect to put you in the Christmas spirit.  I want the moose mugs!\n",

      "A staple of Holiday Tradition. A must see! Chevy Chase is fantastic - the sled scene is the greatest. A joyous romp for the whole family!\n",
      "The best of the \"Vacation\" series. It is Great Fun to watch it every year with our family and friends.\n",
      "Can't go worng with this movie. My family watches it throughout the month of December. It never gets old! Love it\n",
      "One of my favorite Christmas movies of all time!! My family and I watch this movie every year, it just wouldn't be Christmas time with out it!!!\n",
      "Christmas doesn't go by that my family doesn't watch this movie at least 3 times. Getting it in Blu-ray makes the experience even better. The picture is wonderfully clear.\n",
      "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is one of the best Christmas movies of all time!  Gets me in the spirit of Christmas every year!\n",
      "This movie is a Christmas classic movie that our family enjoys every year, I always see something new and funny everytime I watch it!\n",
      "I have been pricing the regular dvd but have seen it for no cheaper than 15.99. With this only 4 dollars more it was an easy choice. Some inside scenes and blacks are grainy but that can be expected with the age of the film. But overall it is a good blu-ray and great if you love the movie as much as I do.\n",
      "I am geting it on DVD this time, we have already worn out two VHS copies!  Gets funnier everytime you watch it, Cousin Eddie is a riot!  Watching National Lampoons Christmas Vacation has become a christmas tradition in  our home.\n",
      "Great movie and a great classic.  Tons of laughs and truly quotable.  You cant go wrong with this one at all!\n",
      "I was not able to find this movie for a reasonable price in stores, so it was a nice surprise to find it online at a reasonable price.  Quality of the disc was excellent.\n",
      "No matter how many times I have seen it. If you like any of the other \"Vacation\" movies this one will have you roaring\n",
      "This is one movie I count on every year since I was kid and saw it at the walk-in theater! Ha Walk-In remember that?!!!\n",
      "forget the black and whites, this is what Middle American Christmas is actually like.  No flashbacks in time or convincing of the likelihood Santa will come, just straight forward hard working American common folks!\n",
      "Always a classic! Hilarious and really puts you in the Christmas spirt. If you like comedy's especially the vacation movies this is for you!\n",
      "Great streaming. No buffering. Looks good on my HD TV. And the fact that it was free with prime was even better\n",
      "Probably the second best National Lampoon's movie.  Chevy Chase makes this movie for me.  I really like his comeback career with the TV show Community.\n",
      "Well over a year ago, I posted a review on this particular DVD version of the movie.  In that review, I complained about the fact that it was only made available in the full screen format.  Well, only moments ago I just recieved a confirmation on a SPECIAL EDITION release of \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\" which will contain a nice new anamorphic widescreen transfer, as well as commentary by Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, et al.So, at long last a holiday tradition is getting the treatment it deserves.  I highly suggest you hold out until October when the funniest Christmas movie ever finally makes itself worthy of being added to a DVD collection.\n",
      "There is nothing in words i can say accept watch this movie. you wont be dissapointed.\n",
      "Love this movie. It's a Christmas classic, it makes me laugh out loud and my kids love to watch it as well!!\n",
      "This has been one of my favorite movies for so long. I love that it's available on prime for me. I will even watch this movie when its not Christmas.\n",
      "Christmas Vacation is a family tradition for us - we watch it at least once every year ... absolutely hilarious and a classic!\n",
      "The squirrel scene always cracks me up :) it's one of my favorite Christmas movies to watch year after year!\n",
      "A holiday classic...just get funnier every time I watch it!  Typical Griswold adventure....The best of the Griswold movies!  A must see!\n",
      "great movie to view for christmas holiday.  Funny and great entertainment movie.  really enjoyed viewing movie with family and friends\n",
      "Always a classic and must see during the holidays!  Video quality was great, Amazon Prime Rules our family loves it!\n",
      "A classic fave in my family's household. My mom's favorite scene is of course teh squirrel rampage. Especially when the grandmother faints. Mine is the dinner table when the pathetic turkey evaporates into dust and Snots hocks a loogie under the table. There's so much insanity going on all at once, it's hard to catch your breath. Oh! and Clark's meltdown is one of the best I've ever seen on film. I'm still trying to memorize every word LOL.\n",
      "This movie has been a favorite of our family for many years. We cannot imagine a Christmas without watching it as a family at least once, if not more. This copy is for a relative who has not seen it - if you can imagine there is anyone who has not seen it.\n",
      "Best Christmas movie ever!  A must watch if you like to laugh and enjoy good humor. I love it. :-)\n",
      "This has to be one of the best \"Vacation\" movies made yet. I cannot express this enough. It's definitly on my list of all time Christmas Classics, and you can still watch it throughout the year!The \"Vacation\" movies really dig into almost any typical American's search to make the perfect vacation, life, experience for their family. Chevy Chase and Beverly DiAngelo just highlight it and make it all funny. I have had many friends and neighbors we could dub \"the Grizwolds\" over the years because of the bumbling things they've tried to do and these movies hit home, especially Christmas Vacation.Buy it, love it!\n",
      "This is a classic that EVERYONE must have in their collection. It's a family tradition to watch it together during December. So many classic lines and scenes that you find yourself using to describe holiday decorations. Bought this for a couple who have NEVER seen it and I felt it was my duty to include them in the pop culture favorite!\n",
      "Grandkids laugh out loud when we watch this film each Christmas. We all enjoy it. Would recommend this to anyone needing a good laugh.\n",
      "This movie is so funny and I havent seen it in a long time so I bought this movie. I loved being able to watch it with my family!\n",
      "My family has always loved to play Christmas Vacation as we put our tree up.  Our tradition was always to go out in the woods and find our own tree.  We had many adventures over the years looking for just the right tree and getting it back home.  This year when we put our tree up we discovered our copy was missing so we had to have another.\n",
      "I knew this was a great movie so I got it for my fiance for Christmas. The quality was awesome, and it was just as I expected it to be.\n",
      "Classic Chevy brings his best in the prime of his career. We can all relate to several parts of this film.\n"

      "A true Christmas  with great humor not to be missed before every Christmas, the best of the Vacation Series !!\n",
      "so I purchased this streaming.. to me its one of the timeless classics of the modern times..The move streamed perfectly  clear.. no skips. sounds was terrific  . picture was clear no staticor breaks.. no blur.. the color was clean  no off colour .. so was it worth it  Absolutely\n",
      "I have watched this movie probably 50 times since it was released in 1989----it is clearly our thanksgiving/christmas go-to movie.  The jokes never get old, and the acting is spot-on.  A must see!\n",
      "Watching this movie has become a family tradition.  We are in our third generation of family that absolutely loves this movie...Even the younger kids, tweens, teens, young and young at heart will love this movie. Chevy Chase, Beverly D, and Randy Quaid perform at their finest.*****\n",
      "Great quality picture and sound! No issues just like being at the movies in the comfort of your own home! Movie super fun!!\n",
      "This is the best Christmas movie. I laugh so hard every time I watch it, which is at 20 times during the holidays.\n",
      "Family favorite and Christmas necessity on DVD...there is nothing like a Griswold family Christmas and now we have it on DVD to enjoy\n",
      "It has a little bit of everything - the beautiful, soon-to-be trashed house, crazy relatives, a rottweiler, and Elaine Benes as your next door neighbor.  Who could ask for anything more?\n",
      "Delightful holiday epic centering around the good-natured Clark Griswold, and his family.  Beverly D'Angelo looked especially good in this.  I have since had dreams of her in a Santa cap (and nothing else).  Rusty and Audrey were kinda lame in the movie.  Randy Quaid was a jerk, but that is his appeal.  I would give this 1/2 thumbs up (due to amputation).\n",
      "This is still one of my favorite Christmas movies! No matter how many times I watch it I still laugh uncontrollably! Definitely my favorite out of the National Lampoons vacations! Watching this every year with my brother(his name is Russ too!)and myself quoting it gets annoying for others but it doesn't bother us!-lol.The only problem I have with this box set is my own fault really because I should have looked closer at the picture when I bought it because I thought I was getting a full size moose mug like in the movie but it's this tiny little figurine instead, oh well. Like I said it was my own fault for not looking closely.Still an awesome gift set anyway! And the movie is well worth it!\n",
      "It's always mildly worrisome to purchase an older film in a newer, more detailed format but Christmas Vacation was restored very beautifully.  We were pleasantly surprised that the textures and the sound came through with such fidelity.  This is our favorite holiday film and Christmas wouldn't be possible without it.  So glad that we added this classic to our blu-ray collection!\n",
      "Great family Christmas movie. All the shinanigans were crazy funny and the underlying lesson of the movie at the end was still relevant to today.\n",
      "Everyone knows what it is about, has seen it, and has made it a tradition in their households to watch it every Christmas. Just adding to my collection.\n",
      "This is a holiday movie classic. Between Clark, the Christmas tree, bad Christmas bonus and the squirrel, you'll be laughing until you're crying.\n",
      "Fun for the whole family! This movie has quickly become a favorite of my two boys as well. They are 12 and 15.\n",
      "This is one my favorites, so I have nothing bad to say! Silly and fun like the other National Lampoons movies.\n",
      "We love this movie and watch it at least once during the Christmas season.  Now our grandchildren are laughing with us.  As many times as we've watched it we still find things that we have missed.\n",
      "Bought this DVD for a friend for Xmas. We make this a part of our Xmas celebration every year.\n",
      "Chevy Chase did it again.  Although this is the worst in the seris it's still phenomonale.  In this one Clark invites all of the faimily, except Eddie who shows up anyway.  He invites Ellen's aunt who's insane, i.e. wrapping up her cat and Jello mold as presents.  Plus, her husband who's like a souped up Aunt Edna.  All in all, very funny.\n",
      "Great fun...great flick.  This is a marvelous family film.  The comedy is based on the typical issues that arise in families...exaggerated, of course.  There's even the grotesque \"trailer-trash\" part of the family that you cannot help but love despite their trashiness.  Comedy does not work when the writers take themselves too seriously, and these writers do not make that mistake.  Parts are laugh-out-loud hilarious.  Yes, there is some \"toilet\" humor, but if don't take yourself too seriously, either, you will love this movie.\n",
      "Video came in good shape, and was on time. Good vendor. Hilarious movie for those who like Chevy Chase's sense of humor!!\n",
      "One of the best Christmas movies out there. Needs to be watched at least once a year. I love it!\n",
      "This is one of the few movies that I have laughed uncontrollably at.  The film immediately gives the viewer a taste of what is to come later when the family is first searching for the \"Griswold Family Christmas Tree\" out in a rural setting.  The family, in their beat up station wagon, gets harassed by a couple of rednecks who end up playing chicken on the road with Clark, the father (Chase).  As the movie progresses towards the final scenes on Christmas Eve and more family members arrive, the scenes become more outrageous, like the issues that rise when both sets of grandparents arrive or the measures Clark takes to decorate the house with Christmas lights. When he finally succeeds in lighting the house, the movie shifts into a different gear when Ellen, Clark's wife's (D'Angelo) cousin Eddie (Quaid) and his family arrives on the scene via a barely running RV with their rottweiler dog that is aptly named for a body condition.  The film is stuck in high gear after this, as scenes become more disastrous and hilarious.  The Christmas Eve dinner features the entire family along with Clark's Aunt Bethany and Uncle Lewis and their senile demeanors.  Random scenes like the dog \"yakkin' on a bone\" during dinner or Bethany's house cat mistakenly wrapped up as a Christmas present add to the hilarity. The movie ends when Clark finds out that he has been shafted by his boss and Cousin Eddie decides to do something about it.  A great holiday classic with many more random, funny scenes not mentioned in this review.\n",
      "Viewed: 11/03, 5/06, 6/11Rate: 85/06: Wildly unusual and perfect for the holiday taste, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a delightfully uproarious comedy picture. Chevy Chase may not have been a good comedian, but this film is where he strikes gold the best. I felt that Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is a more sophisticated work than National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, but the latter works so well enough that it is passed as a genuine Christmas movie in the likes of It's a Wonderful Life. Everything about National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is enriched with familial values. Usually, there would be slew of films being so offensively gross or rancor complemented with ribald humor, but not this one...this is as good as it gets. A lot of wacky, zany moments lurks all over this film. Even though the fact I have seen National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation a zillion times, it never gets old or outdated. It's still one of the best comedies around. There's a great character out of Eddie, played wonderfully by Randy Quaid, who is a gifted comedy actor. Any film that has National Lampoon's in its title is guaranteed to be very bad, but luckily, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is the only one that remains the best of the breed.6/11: When National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation came out in video, it quickly became a mandatory viewing every Christmas season just like how It's a Wonderful Life was. I couldn't forget how so funny the movie was; the wild moments, the zany antics, the sad-but-true incidents, and the hilarious lines. Of all National Lampoon movies, this Christmas one is the only one worth mentioning. Chevy Chase, while a very much an iconic comedy but sometimes funny actor of 80's, delivered the best performance of his career; he just nailed everything just perfect. I could never forget the insane moments: the crash landing into tree lot parking area, the dug out tree, the Jason hockey mask, the sap stickiness, the 25,000 lights plus the drum roll, the slippery surfaced toboggan, the unloading of RV toilet, the 9 lives spent, the burnt tree, the squirrel, the Jelly-of-the-Month club and the aftermath description of the boss, and Ellen's crotch protection. All in all, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a time honored Christmas classic and will always remain the second greatest Christmas picture made.\n",
      "This movie is THE Christmas movie.  If you've never seen it, make sure you do!!  Poor Clark tries to do absolutely everything to make Christmas the best.  But as soon as his entire family gets together, everything starts to go wrong.  This movie is full of laughs and fun for the entire family.\n",
      "If you enjoy the National Lampoon movies from the 80's, you should enjoy this one as well. My husband and I have always enjoyed how Chevy portrays Clark Griswald and in MY opinion this is the best one of the bunch. The supporting cast is phenomenal and the relationships SO believable. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a good laugh.\n",
      "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation will without a doubt become a Christmas classic on viewer's lists.  Viewing this film is a great way to relieve tension during the holiday season.  With his usual enthusiasm Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) sets out to have a fun old-fashioned family Christmas in this sequel to the Vacation movies.  Cousin Eddie once again played by Dennis Quaid does his part to help.  Beverly D'Angelo is back as Ellen, Clark's wife, who struggles to make everything work smoothly.  In true National Lampoon style this film is a funny look at family traditions and holiday events.  With a house full of relatives, decorations and animals the Griswolds once again turn the magic of the moment into a hilarious situation.\n",
      "- Christmas vacation is my favorite movie in the National Lampoons series with Chevy Chase.- Cousin Eddy, Clark and the family get themselves into some hilarious situations with a holiday twist.- Blu ray quality picture is a nice touch after watching it on the older tvs back in the 90s!- Qucik delivery and a great price from Amazon!\n",

      "This is a great movie to watch over and over.  Thereare a few parts unsuitable for under 10 but for the most part it is very funny and entertaining. It isa good light hearted look at the craziness that havingextended family for Christmas can bring. I wouldrecommend this movie for a family night!\n",
      "I watch it every year. I like comedy.i also like movies that are just fun, without any sentimental attempts to try and add  seriousness to the show.\n",
      "I've always loved this movie and had it on VHS and thought I'd rather have the DVD and I'm very happy with it.  thanks for a great deal.\n",

      "Our family watches this movie every year, but we only have it in vhs. So had to get it on a cd.\n",

      "One of the funniest Christmas movies, ever!  We watch this movie every year and laugh until our sides hurt! Love it! 🎄🎁🎅\n",
      "Timeless classic holiday film. Gives you a real family holiday film. Not the\"made up family\" stuff.\n",
      "I liked it when they send the lawn decoration in to orbit, and when they blinded the nieghbors with all those lights, and when they had to cut in another generator had the power station.\n",
      "If so then you got problems. Well, this is a classic. Every Christmas we light the fire, pass out gifts , and laugh our heads off with this movie. It's a laugh out loud Comdey. Take it from the girl who has a family like  this.......ME!I know you'll be thankful you don't have a family like this!\n",
      "We watch this movie every Christmas season.  Very funny, and we have memorized almost every line.  A real hoot!\n",
      "This is part of our family tradition.  Clark Griswold and his family are a great way to enjoy your holidays.  Clark sets the standard for the ultimate Christmas spirit.  This is Chevy Chase at his prime.  The humor and story can be understood and appreciated by a wide range of personalities.  Bottom line, sit back throw a log on the fire, and get ready to laugh at and with the Griswold family.\n",
      "I love this movie! Must admit some of it is a little off color but it is a must see comedy about just what a family can go through during the holiday season. Chevy Chase is the only one that could have pulled this comedy movie off with his style of humor. The entire cast was wonderful- so many icons from the past-great names in Hollywood. Uncle Eddie was halarious! I will watch this again and again!!!!\n",
      "A classic Christmas favorite! :)  some may find it stupid but I always enjoyed it growing up and still never get sick of it! Hence, i decided to buy it on bluray to replace my VHS!\n",
      "I bought this for my boyfriend as a stocking stuffer. It is by far one of the funniest and best Christmas movies!\n",

      "Funny movie i always like to watch durning the holidays. Alway feel like i can relate with some if the seans.\n",
      "This is so true, right? Everyone has those Christmas' where something goes  wrong. I mean and that shaft from his company is not too far from the  truth. My dad one year got 100 bucks to a grocery store. Can you believe  that? Randy Quaid plays a laugh out loud character. I mean who in their  family does not have a character like this? You are not an American citizen  if you do not have some weird relative. This movie is my favorite holiday  movie. Perfect for all year round. You will see every possible holiday  mishap. Get it today!\n",

      "Chevy and Crew make this a all time classic!  Our family have made this a yearly part of Christmas season.\n",
      "Really was surprised to be able to have this running the computer this year while doing my shopping on Amazon.  What a great way to spend my Christmas not in the stores.  This movie is one of our all time favorites, quoting phrases from it all year long.....\n",
      "We watch this movie every year and can't believe how funny it is. It's a bit slapstick and silly but that's the point of it. Hope you enjoy it as much as we do.\n",
      "I love this movie. I've had the regular DVD, Extended DVD, and now the Blu-Ray version. I want to say that the Blu-ray version is only a little bit better than the older copies but, . . . don't expect this older film to have a wonderful \"Blu-ray look\" like the film Batman and other new films coming out these days. In some cases, I find myself distracted and noticing the graininess, in their faces mostly. I'm glad I bought it anyway, of course. If you love this movie, I say buy it!Only one other thing that could have made it all better: Next time get Chevy Chase to do the DVD Commentary.\n",
      "my favorite Christmas movie ever. Was a little disappointed in the fact that I paid alot more than 2.99 for it which was posted later but I am very happy with the purchase thank you Billschwartz4@aol.com\n",
      "All time favorite movie.  We try not to watch it till mid November.  Even the kids have started to could down till we watch Clark out up lights.\n",
      "This just gets better and better.  We watch it every year so it has become a tradition. And we love it\n",

      "This is my favorite Christmas movie. Yes, there are others that are great, but....seriously this is my favorite. Cousin Eddie.\n",
      "This is exactly what a movie should be. It is an incredibly funny movie that has become a family tradition in our household\n",
      "What's the issue? You accidentally deleted it on DVR and you have a strange craving to see this movie again? Because you've obviously seen this movie, right? If not, please stop reading reviews, scroll up, and purchase this movie. It's an American Christmas classic, for Pete's sake. You're better than that.\n",
      "First comes \"A Wonderful Life\" to get the meaning of Christmas going then some fun with this movie. \" The s***ter\"s full\"  !\n",
      "\"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\" is one of those real gems -- you get one every five or ten years, a Christmas movie that defines that moment in time and becomes a holiday favorite like \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" \"Miracle on 34th Street\" and \"A Christms Story\" before it. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo reprise their roles from the previous two \"Vacation\" movies and decide this time to stay home and have an old-fashioned family Christmas. This would not be the Griswold family, of course, if everything didn't go wrong.The only thing disappointing about this DVD set is that Warner Brothers has the nerve to label it a \"Special Edition.\" While it's certainly a step up from the barebones fullscreen DVD released a couple of years ago, there's still not much here. The only special features are the trailer and a commentary track that doesn't even include Chevy Chase. (C'mon, what's he got to do these days that he's too busy to record a commentary?) This would be an okay DVD release, but it's certainly not \"special.\" Still, it's likely to be the best we'll get, and since I avoided the previous release, I picked this one up because I do love the movie.\n",
      "This is great! Great price! Great movie! I love every second of it. This is our second copy-one for our living room one for our bedroom. Year round enjoyment.\n",
      "One of funniest yet loving family-oriented movies made. Chevy Chase and all shot this one over the moon. A Christmas gem.\n",
      "Start your Christmas season with Christmas Vacation. This movie will put you in the mood. We laugh every time we watch it. It's a family tradition to watch on thanksgiving and christmas day.\n",
      "I could watch this more often than A Christmas Story but Home Alone is the only better one.  This is one of the classics.\n",
      "We have watch Christmas Vacation at Christmas time for years.I had to up grade from VHS to DVD since we no longer have theVHS player. This will make you laugh.\n",
      "This movie never fails to make me laugh.  The quintessential holiday movie.  It was made a while ago, but it's a class at this point.  I highly recommend!\n",
      "It is good due to the many confrontations of C Chase in this episode.  2 scenes could be eliminated but that is up to the discretion of the viewer.  All in all it was a fast pace movie with many funny stunts set up for Chevy.\n",
      "Best Christmas movie by far.  One of my favorite movies period, of all time.  I watch this thing over and over again during the season and even during the summer.  Just bought the Blu Ray collectors edition on Amazon.  comes with awesome, well made coasters, santa hat, mini moose glass and fake snow.\n",
      "Enjoy it so much that come the christmas season I have to watch.  Shows how families should act to over come problems and be happy to have a family to enjoy the holidays with.  What can I say I'm just a softy at heart.\n",
      "This is the most ridiculous movie, but it makes me lsugh all year 'round. It's my all time favorite movie!\n",
      "Another very funny Christmas movie. I have wanted it two or three times. Iwanted it in \"Blue Ray\", since I have a blue ray player.\n",
      "chevy chase is very funny, can watch movies with him over and over again. the vacation saga is just very funny:)\n",
      "Fun for the whole family.  Super movie-never gets old.  We actually have an annual Christmas Vacation viewing party with the family to kick off the Christmas season.  Dress in costume and all.\n",
      "Who doesn't have this, a holiday classic.  Watch it every year and still laugh like crazy. Never tire of it.\n",
      "To funny, classic Chevy Chase Xmas fun. I might if died at the box office but now it's a classic!\n",
      "This Movie has been watched by all my Children since they were old enough to sit in front of the television. Like many others who have enjoyed it for years my girls and I love to use quotes from it all year round. It is without a doubt the crown jewel of the National Lampoon Vacation series and I would highly recommend that you add it to your Video Library.\n",
      "this and Christmas Story should be mandatory viewing during the season. Don't miss it. A very funny movie for everyone\n",
      "A must-see Christmas classic that gets funnier every year. There are so many funny scenes in  this movie that there are too many to mention\n",
      "This is THE classic Christmas movie for my generation.....supporting characters that all of us can relate to.....and Chevy Chase at his best......\n",
      "This is one of those movies we used to watch every year when I was a kid and it holds up to the memories.  Chevy Chase is HILARIOUS and his ability to dead-pan is perfect; Julia Louis-Dreyfuss in an early role is a scene-stealer and shows some of the talent that would become evident in her TV career, which has netted her multiple Emmy's and countless accolades. I can't think of one scene that doesn't have me laughing hysterically. It is a true classic.\n",
      "This is absolutely, positively the best Christmas comedy of all time.  It takes a somewhat less than average family and shows you their issues, etc during the holiday season.  I've watched it every year for the last 15 years or more.  You will not be disappointed if you enjoy a good laugh.  Merry Christmas!\n",
      "no better classic checy chase movie ever, best christmas movie ever, can watch this over and over and do every year, the hell with christmas story tnt run this ona loop every christmas\n",
      "As I began to write this, mulling over my thoughts, I noticed a recent negative reviewer who has issues with this films vulgarity and (lack of)morality. We are all entitled to our opinions. Personally I find the series \"Doc Martin\" to be incredibly irritating and if I was a braver man I would write that heretical review and incur the ensuing tidal wave of fan wrath.I decided to go back to the beginning of December and look over what has been said since. In the last 10 days there have been 82 new reviews, 2 upset with video resolution and/or packaging, and 3 unhappy with the actual content of this movie, and 1 person who is on the fence. That is a 96.0 % approval rating. (3/76 = 0.039 X 100 = 3.94 % disapproval)For me a good story speaks to its generation. A great story speaks to many generations. Look at the 1946 Christmas classic \"It's a wonderful Life\" and how it has become such a yearly tradition. And for so many of us \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\" has become one of our traditions.I saw this movie back when it was first released in 1989 not realizing then that it would become such a cultural \"fix\" that I would need to revisit it each yuletide. On the surface it's a side-splittingly hilarious film. Underneath lays a creative, sarcastic and poignant poke at the (sometimes unwanted) chaos, commercialization and socialization that the holidays can demand.Next year will be this movies 25th anniversary. I will be back again (in tears of laughter) viewing it all the while wondering, why was the sequel so awful, and wishfully thinking that it's not too late to make another?\n",
      "Always entertaining.....an annual Christmas pleasure!  We look forward to viewing it every single holiday season....Clark Griswold and Family are the funniest!!!\n",
      "I used to have the vhs tape of this.  Our family played it every christmas till the tape failed.  Love the DVD and the comentary.\n",
      "In my opinion, this is the very best of the \"Vacation\" movies from National Lampoon.  Of course, Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as the Griswolds and Randy Quaid is the incorrigible and disgusting Eddie.  This film is a must have in any collection.  You don't see movies where you can laugh out loud throughout the entire thing.  This one is like that.  The Griswolds play host to both sets of inlaws and various other relatives, including a surprise appearance by white-trash paragons Eddie, Katherine, their kids (who are also different in every movie) and their lovely dog, Snots.  Who wouldn't expect everything to go wrong at the Griswold family Christmas?  The only things you don't expect in this mock-up of holiday cheer are the things that happen.  My family watches this movie every Christmas.  If you haven't seen it, you are really missing out.\n",
      "This is a Christmas time tradition for our family.  Good silly fun for all ages.  I have seen this dozens of times and still laugh.\n",
      "Too funny! Chevy Chase was the man! Makes you wonder if this type of holiday experience doesn't happen more often!\n",
      "Great present or movie to sit down with someone and enjoy.  Also for those awkward family's moments pop this in and everyone is sure to get a laugh during the holidays.\n",
      "This movie speaks for itself, a classic.  If you have not seen it, you must.  I was really surprised how good it looked on Bluray.  Bravo!\n",
      "Great movie. Glad I own it so I can watch it whenever even if its not Christmas time it a awesome comedy all year long.\n",
      "It is the greatest movie. It is a tradition at our house to watch starting usually thanksgiving night. Its starts off the holiday season.\n",
      "This is a Chevy Chase Christmas classic.  I loved it as a child and still love it today.  Highly Recommend!\n",
      "Cant beat the Grizwalds! Who doesn't aspire to be Clark with his awesome lights. Or cousin Eddie and his classic attire. Wouldnt be the Christmas shopping season if the stores were any less hooter than they hotter than they are...\n",
      "We watch this movie every Christmas eve and it is still as funny as the first time we watched it.\n",
      "Chevy Chase at his very best.  We watch this movie every Christmas and decided to buy it rather than rely on a TV station to air it when we wanted to see it.  Funny, funny Christmas movie.\n",
      "from the title you can see i'm alittle disappointed with thisdvd, the problem is that warners did not put enough effort intothis release. so the only thing special about this dvd is the nicely done widescreen transfer of this film, what it lacked was blooper reels, deleted scenes, that's why i rated it four stars & the fact that the sound mix was alittle weak on this dvd , the vhs tape of this film was better , i do wish in the future that warners would make an excellent 5.1. sound mix to update the old pro logic mix not saying it's bad, but it does need to be a little louder . i had to turn the volume to understand what the actors were saying. but besides those things i love this film it's a classic.Highly Recommended.\n",
      "This is good family fun that the whole family can enjoy together. Christmas in our house is not complete until we watch this movie and A Christmas Story.\n",
      "It's a classic that will always be a holiday favorite.  I still crack up at the grandparents and the cat.\n",
      "Like the \"Home Alone\" series this movie has a lot of funny physical comedy in it (though no doubt the scene of the electrocution of a pet cat is NOT one of those instances!)  It is though one of the new 'classics' of holiday viewing, and other than that one scene, is lots of fun.\n",
      "Classic holiday movie with a great conversion to High Definition. A definite must watch at my home during the holidays.\n",
      "\"Hiya Clark\" this movie is an absolute classic. Watching it on blu ray is that much better. Would recommend to anyone.\n",
      "A must watch every year!!!  A classic Christmas comedy that never gets old and has stood the test of time.\n",
      "A classic x-mas movie can watch over and over and still laugh. Watch every holiday with my family, would def. recommend.\n",
      "This is the kind of films they need to start making. Simply hilarious and stands the test of time. Loved the squirrel scene best.\n",
      "I'm sure there are many reviews already on this film- but suffice it to say- it has quickly become one of those \"must sees\" during the holidays.. it is sort of a Murphy's Law Christmas- everything that can go wrong does-  but in the end.. it has a great message- family is important - lest we forget!  Everyone must see it!! and most should own it!\n",
      "Simply the most awesome Christmas movie ever! That there Clark is an RV! Way better than any Hershey's milk chocolate boy sticking his tongue to a poll...\n",
      "I just want to clear up a misconception that another veiwer posted on this sight:The full Screen Version of Christmas Vacation is not Pan-and Scanned. The movie was shot in full frame dimensions, and then the top and bottom was cut off so it would fit a 1.85:1 Movie screen. The \"Matted Widescreen\" version is what was seen in the theater. With the full screen version, you're actuially not missing 20% of the image, you're actually getting 120% of the image. with the widescreen version, you're getting 100%.\n",
      "If you haven't seen this movie, and you enjoy farcical humor, physical comedy, and Christmas lights - stop reading and go watch the movie already. If you don't like that sort of broad humor this movie won't disappoint - you'll hate it.One of the better installments of the 'Vacation' franchise, Chevy Chase plays his usual character trying to do his best for his family but just about to snap, and hilarity ensues.\n",
      "One of my top holiday classics.  If you are looking for a Christmas movie but do not want to drag down by emotion and sentiment, this is your best choice!\n",
      "We watch this movie every year.Classic Chevy Chase.  Outstanding ensemble of players.Virtually every foible of my Christmases past is lovingly portrayed here.\n",
      "This movie is so funny, it's a classic. Chevy Chase is the best.\n",
      "This is a classic, I watch it multiple times every Christmas season plus sometimes in the summer when I feel like it :)\n",
      "My family & I watch this every year so I decided to buy it! The Blu-ray is GREAT and crisp!\n",
      "Hands down, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is the best Christmas comedy ever filmed. I make it habit to watch this movie about ten million times between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve. Even after seeing the film so many times that I can recite it word-for-word, Christmas Vacation remains as hilarious and entertaining as the previous holiday season. More than just a seasonal film, it's one of those rare comedies that it near perfect from beginning to end.Following the ongoing exploits of Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) and the Griswold family, this particular rendition of the classic Vacation movies is arguably the best. As in the previous films, Clark's goal is to create the perfect vacation for his family. Only this time, instead of hitting the road for Wally World, the Griswolds stay at home in suburban Chicago.Julia Louis-Dreyfus (mere months away from signing on to play Elaine on Seinfeld) makes several appearances as Clark's annoying, yuppie neighbor Margot - a character accompanied by her equally yuppie partner, Todd (Nicholas Guest). Randy Quaid makes a return appearance as Cousin Eddie (playing the same role from the original Vacation film). As Clark's less-cultured relative, Eddie is a man whose \"heart is bigger than his brain\". Beverly D'Angelo also returns in her previous role as Clark's wife, Ellen.When Clark vows to create \"the most fun-filled old-fashioned family Christmas ever,\" things naturally go awry. With the Griswold family and their in-laws living under one roof, the relatives constantly get on each other's nerves. Clark sets out to decorate the house for Christmas, and his quest culminates in a 25,000 light extravaganza that cover every square inch of the house. In the process, he nearly breaks his neck several times and knocks out Todd and Margot's window with a flying lance of roof gutter ice.The laughs multiply several times over when Cousin Eddie arrives uninvited and parks the family RV in the Griswold driveway. He brings his wife Catherine, their two kids Ruby Sue and Rocky, and their lovely dog \"Snots\". The crescendo of disaster steadily increases as Christmas Day approaches with the agony compounded by Clark's failure to receive his annual Christmas bonus. Clark's big Christmas surprise for the family is that he's putting in a pool, but in order to start work as soon as the ground thawed out, he had to put down a hefty deposit which his check won't cover without the Christmas bonus.After a Christmas Eve in which the turkey explodes, Aunt Bethany's cat electrocutes itself, Uncle Lewis burns down the tree, and a squirrel gets loose in the house, a late night knock on the door gives Clark hope. A deliveryman hands him an envelope which fell between the seats - the fabled Christmas bonus.But when the bonus turns out to be a membership in the Jelly-Of-The-Month Club instead of the cash he expected, Clark goes nuts. He extensively curses his boss, Frank Shirley, and tells the family that a nice Christmas gift would be Shirley wrapped in big red bow. Wanting to do something nice for Clark, Cousin Eddie takes the request literally. He kidnaps Mr. Shirley and delivers him to the Griswold house where Mr. Shirley reveals he cut out Christmas bonuses this year. Clark confronts him, and Mr. Shirley agrees that it was the wrong thing to do. He reinstates the bonuses, and tells Clark to add twenty percent. The whole family erupts in celebration, but their Christmas party is soon crashed by a SWAT team which takes the house by siege.Originally released in 1989, Christmas Vacation has surprisingly little content that makes it look \"dated\". As such, it's certain to be a holiday viewing tradition for generations to come...The DVD Report\n",
      "I watch this movie every Christmas!!! Love it!!!!  Got parts from this movie memorized- can quote it as it plays.\n",
      "Really enjoyed watching this movie of the furter adventures of the Griswold family. I think everyone can relate to trying to have the perfect holiday,\n",
      "Maybe the best Vacation ever. If you are a Chevy Chase fan, this is a must have for your collection.\n",
      "This movie has become a yearly tradition in our home.  Follow the Grizwold family as they prepare for the Christmas holiday and welcome family, expected and unexpected, into their home.  The complications prove hilarious from beginning to end.  You won't want to miss a side splitting minute!Kathy Althouse\n",
      "What would christmas be without NL? One of few reasons I can't wait for Christmas to roll around! Cheers Mr. Griswold!\n",
      "The original Vacation movie was amazing and we never thought it could be matched.  Well they did it again!  This classic has been in our family movies to watch on ever year!\n",
      "This is ''Clark Griswold'' at his merry best. The hopes and fears of a family celebration are certainly present in this rollicking, fun filled adventure. Clark and his jolly band of relatives along with two of the yuppy-est neighbors on the planet, give a new definition to the term; merrymaking.\n",
      "This is simply one of THE Best Christmas Movies ever made. We watch this movie at least five times every Christmas Season. And now we can finally watch it in full HD DVD! If you want it buy it from Amazon though because it is almost impossible to find anywhere else. And if you like Christmas Comedies good for the whole family try ELF too!\n",
      "Clark Griswold is the man with the Christmas spirit.  This movie, despite it's age is still hilarious, and is probably among only a handful of holiday flicks that deserve an annual repeat.  If you haven't see this movie, you must.  It works on so many levels, especially if you've ever had family crap all over your holiday joy.\n",
      "A must have for any National Lampoon's fan, especially for the holiday season. Couldn't stop laughing even watching it for the umteenth time!\n",
      "Far and away the best of the \"Vacation\" movies.  Had the tape and wore it out.  It's fun watching people who have never seen it spit their drink out of their nose\n",
      "What more can be said about this FUNNY movie..A classic for sure, one that we give every year to different people of course...Great seller, fast shipper..will buy another this yr..Thanks\n",

      "I love this movie.  I have owned it for years but with my new HDTV I wanted the Blue Ray 16X9 version.  It was just what I expected.  The content of the movie was just as great as ever.\n",
      "Eddy: \"It is the gift that keeps on giving the whole year.\"Clark: \"That it is Edward, that it is.\"\n",
      "All time favorite Christmas movie in our house!  Never get sick of watching Christmas vacation.  Non-stop laughter. Will and watch whenever we see it's on.\n",

      "Awesome movie. No matter how many times I watch this movie. I always find myself laughing at new stuff!! A must see\n",
      "I laugh everytime I watch this movie.  Anyone who has ever fought Christmas lights outside after you have spent hours hanging them can relate to this movie. I think that cousin Eddy is the hit of this film!\n",
      "LOVE - LOVE - LOVE this movie!  I watch it on occasion when I am feeling \"down in the dumps\" - much better than taking any anti-depressant drugs!!!\n",
      "Great holiday movie you can share with the family! \"Hey Griswald where do you think you're going to fit that tree?!\" Funniest line ever.\n",
      "My wife and I just received this in the mail on Friday. I have read a lot of reviews about the quality and sound of the movie and my two cents worth is, yes you really cant tell a big difference in the quality but there is a difference. There is a little more depth in the blu-ray than on the regular dvd. I loved all the little trinkets that came with the blu-ray!!!!!! Some people complained that they were crappy and cheap, well what do you expect for something that costs less than $40. If you wanted high dollar memorabilia then maybe you should try an auction instead of a mass produced blu-ray tin!! All in all I love the blu-ray and the trinkets that came with it.\n",
      "arrive in excellant shape and on time. quailty of disk perfect, movie was very funny and very good. makes it nice to watch at xmas\n",
      "It is a treasure of fun and comedy and some unusual characters that join the infamous group with fun, laughter and good cheer.  His dreams are large which may be a recommendation to us all.  Go for it, even if you fail........\n",
      "If you like dumb set ups and stupid jokes this is the movie for you. Chevy Chase is always entertaining. A great family film that will leave you laughing.\n",
      "Watching Christmas Vacation after the Thanksgiving meal is a holiday tradition in our family.  We never get tired of it.\n",
      "I love watching this moving, over and over again.  Even when it is not christmas, we can all relate to the clark griswold family...\n",
      "It was a good show but a little sillier than I expected.  It has a good message about the importance of family.\n",
      "A classic and excellent funny movie!  We watch it over and over every year.  It was just as we expected.\n",
      "Slap-stick comedy at it's very best.  A movie to be enjoyed by young and old alike.  It will always be one of my favorite Christmas movies.\n",
      "Watching this became a Christmas tradition that started when my son was 5. Great movie where the jokes never get old.\n",

      "After viewing this movie on television during the Holiday season, just had to haveit in our collection. It's good clean fun and brings a load of laughs throughoutthe entire movie, with a happy ending. What more could one want.\n",
      "It's a classic!  HD really makes this movie awesome!  Every family should have a copy of this movie in their home or on their electronic device!\n",
      "Wonderful Christmas movie.  The only problem is that I'm related to everyone in the movie! I need to see it every Christmas.  It's good the rest of the year too.\n",
      "My husband asked for this movie with only a couple weeks to go before the Holiday.  I shopped several different stores and couldn't find it anywhere.  Was very happy when I found it online.  With the expected receipt date after the Holiday I printed a picture of the DVD to put into a box but it showed up the day before Christmas.  He opened it Christmas morning and we immediately watched it.\n",
      "This is such a Funny movie! It is a holiday staple that my family watches each Christmas season. Must see movie.\n",

      "I love all the vacation movies. I collect them.  This video is funny and gets you into the christmas spirit.  I'd rather see a funny christmas story then a sappy sad one.\n",
      "Great cast playing over the top characters that make us all feel more normal as they work through life's problems.\n",
      "Holiday classic. I can't go a Christmas without watching this movie. Quality is fantastic an the instant streaming is a plus!\n",
      "The best Christmas movie ever!!! This movie incapsulates the real American family around the holidays. It seems like the older I get the more I realize every family has a Cousin Eddy!!\n",
      "I finally broke down and purchased this movie because I am tired of it never being on HBO or any of the other premiums. It's always on demand for $5 but why not own it for a few bucks more? The bonus features are surprisingly nice.\n",
      "An awesome movie, a Christmas classic. Everyone should see this at least once every Christmas season!\n",

      "We watch this movie every christmas. It has become a family tradition. I think everyone should watch this movie at least once.\n",
      "OMG this movie was so so so funny. My family and I wached this movie during the Christmas Holiday.We are looking forward to ordering second sequel.\n",
      "And always have!  It's a must see each Christmas in my family....of adults.  Not appropriate for young children, secondary to language and some scenes.\n",
      "If you haven't seen this movie- you should! It's very funny, and it's my favorite of the \"National Lampoons\". You'll really enjoy it.\n",
      "This hysterical movie puts you right into the holiday spirit. It definately inspired my husband to decorate our house and begin feeling the holiday magic early in the season. This is his favorite Christmas movie. My only complaint is the packaging with the soft, cardboard cover. It should be packaged in a standard, plastic case. Otherwise, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a great addition to any collection. Looking forward to enjoying it for many  holidays ahead or as long as the packaging holds up!\n",
      "It's a classic for what it is, if you are going for a good laugh and humor that is painfully close to reality it's a win\n",
      "Order and view on line,,, AWESOME. Bye bye Redbox & Blockbuster. No lost dvd and late fee from Blockbuster, no scratched junk from red box & easy to use PLAY & USE options on Amazon.\n",
      "This is a holiday classic we watch each year as a family.  It's still funny even after seeing it several times!\n",
      "Delivered in HD, so funnmany laughs and sterotypes mocked really enjoyed the movie at this sitting. If you want to laugh watch this\n",
      "Our whole family loves National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  We watch it every year.  Which is amazing, since I can't stand Chevy Chase.  He makes me sick.  He makes me gag.  But I love the movie.\n",
      "Great classic Chevy movie!  I never get tired of watching this every Christmas. Put it on your list and watch it with the family.\n",
      "Love this movie.One of the funniest,we watch it every christmas.You know whats coming but cant wait to see it.\n",
      "Best movie ever made.  Classic christmas movie.  Best national lampoon movie.  Chevy Chase is hilarious. Merry Christmas s***ters full! Uncle Eddie!\n",
      "It was received in the time. I received the product as described. The price was right. I would order again.\n",
      "Its funny, not great and not terrible but funny.  There are worse movies out there and certainly more funny ones.  It will warm your holiday heart.\n",
      "This is a classic movie that we watch every year during the holidays.  We can quote lots of the classic lines. The whole family loves it. It's a must watch!\n",
      "I have a VHS copy of this movie, which has been watched during the Christmas season for years.  Alas, this year it crashed, and has now been replaced with newer technology.  I won't open it till next Christmas, it should beat the underwear and socks I usually get for Christmas.\n",
      "In his own comic way Chevy Chase captures the joy, challenges and frustrations many father's feel at Christmas.  It is surprising he handles some of the situations as well as he does.  I would NOT have let Randy Quaid in my house!  But his father in the movie sums it up the best when he mentions a lot of Christmases talking to Jack: Jack Daniels.  Me too!\n",
      "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a family traditon for us.  We watch it as a family every year during the holiday season.  Now each of us will have a BLURAY copy.\n",
      "It has been a \"must watch\" every year a couple weeks before Christmas ever since it came out - either on TV or on CD.  It has the \"perfect\" cast.  Chevy Chase is at his best, Randy Quaid is hilarious, and if you like Johnny Galecki on \"Big Bang Theory\", which we are big fans - you will love the cute little guy he portrays.  You don't want to miss it for family entertainment.  We get a big bowl of popcorn, build a roaring fire in the fireplace, gather everyone around, and enjoy the BEST.\n",
      "Always a holiday classic. We watch it every year and it never loses any of its charm. I recommend it for everyone.\n",
      "Even after all these years, this movie still makes me laugh. It is a must-see each and every holiday season.\n",
      "The Christmas season is never complete without seeing this movie. This is a classic that will remain in my holiday rotation forever!\n",
      "While this movie could never surpass movies like \"A Christmas Carol\" or \"It's A Wonderful Life\", I can't help but coming back to this year after year. The movie is extremely funny and is heartwarming in it's own way.If you have not seen this yet, and you can get past a few crude jokes, then please check this one out.\n",
      "One of my favorite families.  If you want to have a good laugh this is the movie to buy.  My daughter who doesn't like older movies actually sat down and watched it twice with me.\n",
      "This movie is a holiday tradition for our family.  Chevy Chase at his \"finest\" !  LOL  I Love this movie!!\n",
      "Any one of the national lampoon vacation movies are awesome!! I would say Christmas and Vegas vacation are the best ones though!\n",
      "Watch it every Christmas love it!  Chevy chase is great in this movie and everyone should see this movie ASAP!\n",
      "Who hasn't seen this movie?It's a classic, I can watch it over and over.Definitely one of the greats.\n",
      "This movie is a Christmas classic. For me it ranks up there with The Christmas Story and classic cartoon movie The Grinch who Stole Christmas. What separates this title from the later is it is way more funnier.  You can't go wrong with this movie.\n",
      "I recommend this Blu-ray. An excellent movie. Great quality, sound it basic, not much could be done with what was available.\n",
      "Its good. Uncle Eddie is my hero and I have that same camper that he has. Its good. Its good.\n",
      "Greatest movie ever made. My family and I have loved watching this movie together during the holidays. I would recommend this movie to anyone!\n",
      "I've been watching this movie for YEARS and it's a good watch. Funny most of the time and good for family to watch together with slightly older children.\n",
      "We had the DVD version of this and jumped on picking the Blu Ray version up on here for super cheap.  Its a great transfer, looks and sounds awesome.\n",
      "Oh, the joys of family get togethers. Never a dull moment, especially when 'Sparky' continues to have 'delusions of grandeur'. His visions fall apart of course, but in hilarious ways. Though I think Chevy Chase was a bit upstaged by Randy Quaid (and his garbage eating mutt) in this one, the entire cast is delightful. You don't have to wait until Christmas to buy it!Chrissy K. McVay - Author\n",
      "Watch every year and never quits being funny. I laugh before the funny part gets there cause I know what's coming.\n",
      "Every time I see this movie I laugh!  it is exceptionlly funny and the kids love it!  the story never gets old.\n",
      "Great film for the whole family to watch to get everyone in the mood of Christmas; or even watch Christmas Eve.  The movie is extremely funny and will no doubt be a timeless classic for all generations to see.\n",
      "We watch it every year!It'snow a classic-kids andgrandkids laugh each timeand I've given it as Christmas gifts.\n",
      "Have to have this movie in your Christmas Collection. When you need agood laugh, this movie is it. Good condition and plays like a charm..\n",
      "Love this movie.  They just don't make them like this anymore.  Hilarious. I would give it 100 stars if I could! lol\n",
      "This and this alone, is the only Christmas movie anyone would ever need.  The comical events are unparalleled, and Chase is tremendous.  The story line will keep you interested as one thing happens after another.  Cousin Eddie is in this one, and is better than his first debut.  Additional relatives are introduced and are by far a great addition to the unluckiest family to ever exist.  No Christmas is complete without the viewing of this holiday classic.\n",
      "This movie has more classic lines than most any movie ever made. Non stop laughter!! Must see!! Chevy Chase at his funniest!\n",
      "This has been a classic in my family since I was a kid. It's still as funny and relatable today as it was when released.\n",
      "A great classic Christmas movie that a must see during the holidays season.  There are too many great one liners in this movie.\n",
      "This movie is always great, no matter how many years I have watched it.  It gets better each time.  They don't make movies like this anymore.\n",
      "The only movie that comes close to Christmas Vacation are the other Vacation movies. Chevy Chase is a master at being a funny man. If you want more make sure you watch all the Vacation Moves.Thanks to the cast for the best movie ever.\n",

      "THIS IS MY HUSBANDS FAVORATE MOVE.  I DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY TIME HE WATCHES IT BEFORE CHRISTMAS.  THIS YEAR I WILL WATCH IT AND THINK OF HIM. HE DIED SUDDENLY IN MAY AND THIS WILL BRING BACK GRAT MEMORIES.\n",
      "I have always enjoyed Chevy Chase in the National Lampoon movies.  We watched this with my two granddaughters, and I forgot that there is some questionable language in the movie, but it is still as funny as ever.  A great holiday tradition to relieve some stress.\n",
      "A Christmas classic for our family. Helps me get all pumped up for the holiday and makes me appreciate my crazy family cause not that crazy\n",
      "This is the definitive Christmas DVD all about Christmas and all the relatives and family coming once a year! LOL\n",
      "Classic Christmas movie! What more can you say?  Chevy at his best and the pinnacle of the National Lampoons franchise!\n",
      "Cousin Eddie, nothing more needs to be said!  Combine him with Snot and the Griswalds and this is one we watch every year!\n",
      "It never gets old!  It's become a Christmas tradition to watch this movie every Christmas.Love this movie! I'm sure everyone will enjoy it.\n",
      "Classic Chevy Chase comedy!  I watch it at least one time a year.  If you need a laugh watch this movie.\n",
      "This is one of the funniest Christmas movies ever made. It has become an anual event for everyone in our family to watch this movie every year. It is one of those that you never get tired of seeing. Actually becoming a Christmas classic.\n",
      "What you see is what you get.  A classic in Blu-ray.  We watch this movie every Christmas.  It wouldn't be the same without it.  The blu-ray quality is nice.\n",
      "One of the best movies for Christmas time. Always in the classic movie picks for the season.You must watch this every year!\n",

      "This is one of my favorite movies at Christmas time. I watch it multiples times during the Christmas season, and I enjoyed it even more with the Blu-Ray version. My previous version was in 4:3 format and the quality was rather low. This version fills my TV screen and provides a much better picture.\n",
      "I remember going with my parents and grandparents to see Christmas Vacation at the theater back in 1989 (Just writing this makes me feel old.). It is the third film out four of the National Lampoon Vacation series and it is the best out of the sequels. It later spawned a spin-off sequel with Cousin Eddie, but it was dreadful to watch. Christmas Vacation is played to death thanks to CMT and Comedy Central. I would rather watch the unedited version on DVD.\n",
      "The attic sequence, oh my god, so funny. The ladder in the face and feet in the air.In the attic three boards to the face, a window in the head and falling through the ceiling.And finally when his wife opens the attic and it is best to watch this in slow-mo.Then the sled sequence: Oh, Shiiiiiiiiiit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Overall the entire movie is excellent\n",
      "This is one of my favourite Christmas movies.It's all about a Father, who wants his family to have the perfect family Christmas - but like everybody, he's not perfect.. and he causes some major problems.It has all you need in a good Seasonal film. Humour, morals (come on, the ending had something) and the ability to make you really excited about Christmas, especially if it's close.I only saw it for the first time last year - but I watch it quite a lot. It's one of those films which are addictive. You watch it once and you watch it again and again and again.It's a real Christmas classic for me.Just a warning though: It's not your average Christmas film. There's some rude words and suggestions in it. Thing is though, I think it's been edited for the UK.. because something that has been described in the movie wasn't on my DVD.10/10 - Great Seasonal Comedy\n",
      "Do you need to look at a review for a movie that has been out this long? Just watch it.\n",
      "One of the funniest movies ever....used to be on tv every year but no more so i missed seeing it and ordered it.\n",

      "Lots of laughs and every person watching this movie can see a part of themselves in one of the various family members.\n",
      "Our whole family likes this movie, my son's family puts it on while they decorate the tree.  Will always be one our favorites\n",
      "Chevy Chase is hilarious! This is the second best Christmas movie behind Die Hard! I was laughing my ass off!\n",
      "I enjoyed it as much now as I did when it first came to the silver screen. Always good for a laugh around the holidays.\n",
      "I already love the movie(s), but wanted my own copy rather than trying to find it on tv. Used DVD arrived looking practically brand new and well packaged. No issues.\n",
      "Great product and a great price. I highly reccomend this product. Great cost and the item was in great shape.\n",
      "Chevy chase at his best, can't get much better than this as far as Christmas movies that you can watch year after year\n",
      "does anything else need to be said? this is for sure the best xmas movie and best of the lampoons vacations... 10 bucks for the blu ray new? done\n",

      "An absolute must watch for Christmas!  It is so funny and has so many things in it that make you realize that your chaotic Christmas could be a lot worse if your life were anything like this movie!\n",
      "If you have any sense of humor this will keep you laughing the whole christmas season and many years to follow!\n",
      "This month this movie was genuinely funny. There were some really stupid parts that leave you in stitches. The only complaint is that there could've been less profanity.\n",
      "I really liked this movie. I watch it every year and it still makes me laugh! It's a great classic!\n",

      "It's Christmas. It's a Christmas story. It's tradition, It's funny, It's been a long time since I saw it last so I was ready for a refresher.\n",
      "Falls right into today's Christmas viewing rotation.  Oscar, if not Golden Globe or Razzie worthy. Chase/ D'Angelo comments are fun.\n",
      "Classic Christmas movie - in the H-D Format movies never looked better,that along with a great price, and good extras. A must have to get through the holidays.\n",
      "One of our favorite Christmas movie specials.  We couldn't find ours, so ordered this one to replace it.  Arrived quickly and was in great condition.\n",
      "Yes, it's true. Your service is second to none. Thank you. I will keep you in mind for future orders.\n",
      "Like It's A Wonderful Life, A Christmas Story and A Christmas Carol (Alistair Sim 1951 version) this movie finds its way onto my parents' living room TV at some point just before Christmas.\n",
      "This is the basis of our annual Christmas movie watching, we watch this movie every year and it's one of our favorites.  It's a good family comedy movie that gets everyone in a good mood.  Chevy Chase does an awesome job as the lead character and Randy Quaid as the unwelcome family member is always a great twist.  The Griswalds just want a great all American family Christmas with the entire family present and enjoying each other.  Just one thing after another seems to sabotage that hope in a funny change of events.\n",
      "Great movie, we love to watch this as we put up our christmas tree and on Christmas Eve. Now Blu-ray makes it even better.\n",
      "great christmas movie or for that matter a great all around make you laugh movie when your down in the dumps chevy chase is crazy.\n",
      "Clark Griswold is planning the perfect \"family Christmas\" but just like previous \"Vacation\" films, things don't seem to go as planned. From an unexpected visit from his cousin-in-law Eddie (Randy Quaid in a show-stealing performance) to an overpacked (and over-lit) house, there seems to be problems at every corner for the Griswold clan. If you're looking for a hilarious Christmas movie, this is one of the very best that there is. This \"Special Edition\" is a bit light on bonus features. There is an audio commentary with the cast and crew (no Chevy Chase or Juliette Lewis though) and the original trailer. Even if the DVD isn't jam-packed, you can't go wrong in picking up this holiday classic.\n",
      "This movie is great! There are sooo many gut-busting laughs in it and I am serious! Its soooo funny!\n",
      "Christmas classic.  Makes you laugh and cry.  Clark Griswald is my hero...loves his family and wants to celebrate to the max!\n",

      "Love this movie! Cast to perfection, five for just plain ole FUNNY! Never get tired of this movie, one of my all time favorites!\n",
      "Can't go wrong with this Christmas classic starring Chevy Chase, Randy Quaide and a great cast of characters.  Since it's release it's been inspiring plenty of suburban families to deck out their houses with holiday lighting worthy of the Griswolds.  Provides that much needed chuckle prior to braving the holidays with extended family. \"Merry Christmas..Sh***trs Full\"!\n",
      "Cult Classic in our family, it is a movie we watch every Christmas Eve! Reminds us what's important YOUR CRAZY FAMILY! LOL :)\n",
      "I cannot start the Christmas season without this movie. It's hilarious. It reminds me that we all have crazy families, especially when you get together for the holidays.\n",

      "Chevy Chase seems to have a long string of funny movies and this is another winner , the entire cast very enjoyable movie even after all these years.\n",
      "Hilarious! We watch it every year at Christmas. I don't know how anyone could give this a bad review as if you're buying this, you've most likely already seen it...just buy it!\n",
      "DVD shipped with a broken case. Was disappointed but the disk was in good shape. This movie is a family tradition we watch it every Christmas! Glad to have in bluray!!\n",

      "Christmas classic. Along with Home Alone, Rudolf, Scrooge, Elf, and Miracle on 34th St., it is one we always watch during the \"season.\"Hysterical !\n",
      "I love to watch this every year while wrapping presents. :)x x x x x x x x x x\n",
      "This movie is very popular in my family, but we only had it in VHS until now! Im so glad that I was able to get this movie on DVD, so the family can start watching it again!\n",
      "I usually hate reruns but I love this movie so much I had to buy it!  I laugh until I cry even though I know what is going to happen next!\n",
      "What can I say it's National Lampoons Christmas Vacation - just your typical disfunctional family gathering.  One of those that makes you realize your family's not that bad . . . sometimes :)\n",
      "Funny-love all the lampoons-others are funnier-played fine.Yadah, Yadah, Yadah, Yadah, Yadah, Yadah, Yadah, Yadah, Yadah,This word count restriction is ridiculous\n",
      "This movie has something for everyone, a great classic that will entertain from 2 years old to 90 years old!\n",
      "super funny great holiday movie (with some quirks like real life) who doesn't like Chevy Chase ? if you don't then don't watch this!!!\n",
      "Christmas time always brings head aches and frustration because you are filled in a room with people you hate to see, but its that time a year where you have to be nice. Be a good sport and put this DVD on, All of you would die with laughter, swearing that cousin eddy is everyone but you. Enjoy!\n",
      "simple light hearted humor which can be enjoyed by the entire family, perhaps Chevy Chases best work and legacy.  Fun.\n",
      "This is my family's favorite Christmas movie of all time. GIVE IT A CHANCE, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. Classic American comedy, Cousin Eddie is my favorite character. Two thumbs up.\n",
      "It's a classic, what else is there to say?  So many quotable scenes.  We watch it at least once every year.\n",
      "So I was probably the last person in America who had never seen this movie before.  It was enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an amusing holiday film.\n",
      "One of the best Christmas movie.  I bought this a gift for my secret santa and she loved the quality of the video.\n",
      "Great movie, full of memorable quotes and scenes. Easy to watch over and over again. A true holiday comedy classic!\n",
      "National Lampoon's Christmas Vcation is ne of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  It's the third installment in the Vacation saga.  it is the funniest of the four.  It follows Clark Griswold, who wants to have a good old fashion family Christmas.  Well he doesn't exactly get just that.  It is areaolly funny movie...\n",
      "This movie has always been a favorite.  We all have a cousin Eddie.  And we all have a little cousin Eddie inside\n",
      "I love this movie! It is definitely a Christmas classic that should be in everyone's collection.Quality of product is great and the on time delivery made for a 5 star review.\n",
      "very funny and interesting movie for Christmas time. A whole family gather together and this is just the one to enjoy!\n",
      "All too often, I have found the words \"National Lampoon's\" to be synonymous with \"not funny,\" but National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is actually a pretty entertaining film.  Christmas at the Griswold's turns out just like you would expect it to, with Clark (Chevy Chase) trying to persevere in the face of one disaster after another.  With the whole family coming over, he wants everything to be perfect - from the Christmas tree he finds and cuts down (er, digs up) himself to the thousands of lights he staples all over the house.  He's not completely stupid, though - he knows his parents and his wife's parents are going to argue throughout the holidays, that his wife and kids aren't all that excited about sharing Christmas with the rest of the family, and that Aunt Bethany couldn't get back in the loop even if she knew where to find it, but he's determined to make this the best Christmas ever.Of course, there are a few things Clarke wasn't counting on: countless problems getting all the decorations up and working, the unexpected arrival of cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and his backwater brood in their junky RV, or the unwelcome visits of the aptly-named Snots the dog and a special Christmas squirrel.  Then, of course, there's the cat-related tragedy, the Christmas bonus bugaboo, and that whole police raid.The filmmakers brought together a really good cast for this film.  Beverly D'Angelo is Clarke's perfectly understanding wife, while Johnny Galecki and a young Juliette Lewis play the long-suffering Griswold kids.  The in-laws include Doris Roberts and E.G. Marshall, while Randy Quaid is perfectly cast as crude cousin Eddie.  You even have Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a neighborly victim of all the Griswold Christmas cheer and yet another SNL alum, Brian Doyle-Murray, as Clarke's boss at work.  With John Hughes, who could almost do no wrong back in the 1980s providing the script, it makes for a pretty simple recipe for comedic success.This movie never managed to make me laugh out loud, but it is consistently amusing and entertaining.  It's not like you could pack any secret laughter bombs the audience would never see coming because the audience knows exactly what kind of slapstick humor to expect.  Still, it's the simple things, such as Aunt Bethany's blessing of Christmas dinner, that prove to be the funniest.  I might also add that the gross-out humor is kept to something of a minimum, thank goodness.  I won't be making this film a part of my annual Christmas tradition by any means, but it's certainly worth one viewing.\n",
      "Obviously not filmed when blu-ray or hd was available, but the picture quality was higher than I expected. I'd buy \"old fims\" on blu-ray again\n",
      "This is the funniest Christmas movie ever.  Randy Quaid has the best lines and steals the movie.  A must see for the holidays.\n",
      "It has become tradition to watch Christmas Vacation every year during the holidays, and it is just as funny as ever.\n",
      "Came right on time and like new.  Haven't seen this movie any ages and we got it and watched it as a family and layghed so hard all togther.  Thanks!\n",
      "I watch this during the year. It doesn't have to be Christmas time to enjoy this classic. Chevy Chase is awesome!\n",
      "To the one person whou gave it one star because of a download problem:  for petes sake, don't rate the movie based on the completely separate download process!  Go rate the unbox service if you really feel you have to.As far as the movie goes, this is one of the movies I watch EVERY christmas.  Chevy Chase is very funny, and the rest of the members in his extended family are also very good.  Every family has their problems during christmas, but watching this family's hilarious experiences makes me really appreciate christmas that much more.\n",
      "This movie has become a standard for my family to watch anytime between after Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas morning, usually several times. If you don't like it, I hope you are enjoying life clinging to communism.\n",
      "Hilarious movie I watch every year on Christmas Eve. A good mix of physical comedy based in a family holiday atmosphere.\n",
      "Definately a great buy! I would recommend it to everyone.  The remastering is done very well and the picture is great.\n",
      "Great movie! A Classic! Good for all ages to watch around the holidays. My 7 year old loved it! the end\n",
      "The movie will be around forever.  It's funny and just a great movie to watch during the holidays or any time during the year for a good laugh.\n",
      "It's a classic and my Dad was happy with it. His VHS tape wore out. Needed a replacement. Thank you\n",
      "What can I say about this classic?  It is as funny now as it was when I first saw it in college in 1989.  I never get sick of this in any format!!!!\n",
      "My whole family enjoys watching this movie. You can watch just pieces of it and laugh. Once a year it is great.\n",
      "This is simply great! Every single thing Randy Quaid says & does is hysterical. Chevy Chase was near the end, but still in his \"power curve\". Bev DiAngelo is awesome & Juliet Lewis' teenage performance was a window into great things to come. You also get fire, explosions & the humiliation of the two most hellish yuppies ever put on screen. Though I rented it, we will end up buying the DVD!\n",
      "My absolute favorite Nat'l Lampoon Vacation movie...Chevy Chase at his finest...It is a movie I absolutely MUST watch at Christmas time every year!\n",
      "No cable, no problem. Rented this movie on Amazon.com and streamed it to my t.v. Couldn't find it to rent in the local stores and didn't have cable so I rented it online and watched it without ever leaving the comfort of my home.\n",
      "Everyone enjoys this (now) Christmas Classic.  It's a standard family movie sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  So much so, we pretty much have worn our original copy out.\n",
      "Love this movie, watch at least 10 times in December. My family quotes lines of from the movie word for word, we all have a great time watching this Christmas Classic.\n",
      "We all really like to watch National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation and a Christmas Story over the holidays, they are a family tradition.\n",
      "As number 2 of the 4 series of movies, it's definitely the second-most funny of them (let's not even discuss 3 and 4, agreed?).Just when you think you're going to get pulled into a sentimental sweet perspective on goofball Clark, he gets the floor pulled out from under him (literally).The scene of Beverly D'Angelo's hand-placement when the cops bust in the house is toooo much!Two thumbs up!\n",
      "Just a good, fun movie. There are a couple of lines that parents need to be aware of, but nothing that ruins this classic.\n",
      "It's the greatest Christmas movie ever, period. It's a shame it was made before the digital era, HD and BluRay.\n",
      "great movie for those who want a laugh! Chevy chase is so cool when it comes to dry humor.....expect to laugh\n",
      "I watch this movie every holiday season and never gets old. Good family movie for kids 8 years and older.\n",
      "This has got to be the finniest, over-the-top Christmas movie ever made. Its hard to believe it was made in 1989. It has a look and feel like it was made 2 or 3 years ago. The Christmas season wouldn't be complete without Clark Griswold and family.\n",
      "Best movie ever chevy chase is a classic and randy quaid and rest of cast nailed it with this addition.\n",
      "It's a good family movie, that can be watched any time of the year because it's a great family comedy for the whole family.\n",
      "Regardless of how many times you watch 'Christmas Vacation', it will leave you laughing in tears. The Griswald family at their best and at Christmas, nonetheless.\n",
      "We love watching this movie every year.It is a great tradition.Get the DVD to avoid the extra 40 minutes of commercials.Be aware that there is adult language in this movie that is muted in the TV version.Modern Classic!\n",
      "Watch this at least once every Christmas.  Cousin Eddie is a classic and this is vintage Chevy Chase.  Watch for the Walleyworld reference!\n",
      "One of the funniest classic Christmas movies ever made! Chevy Chase is at his best! Highly recommend this movie for your personal dvd collection at home!\n",
      "still just as funny when it was  New.  every family at one time or another has had holidays  get  together like this one\n",
      "Classic Chase.  Laughter all night long with this one.  Want to watch other Chase movies now.  Maybe Saturday Night from 1970's too.\n",
      "Watching this film, myself, as an adult, I was just hysterical with laughter; I loved it!!But, watching it, as a father, well, I'll just say...it's not a family film. I felt on a whole, it's no worse than the \"Home Alone\" films, with the laugh-out-loud physical humor; on the other hand, there was brief nudity, and strong language (they say the 'F' word once, but still...), I can't comfortably allow my children to enjoy this film, and share the humorous moments (and there were many) with me.In short, I loved it. I appreciate good comedy. But, if you are searching for a wholesome, family Holiday film the whole entire family can enjoy together...well, um keep searching. As an adult, I enjoyed it; as a dad, I have to say it's not entirely approriate for younger viewers.\n",
      "The movie itself deserves 5 stars because it's a Christmas classic, but the streaming was skittish at times. However, I'll try Amazon prime video again.\n",
      "Classic movie that is great for the whole family minus a bit of bad language. If you want to LOL I recommend you get this movie!!!\n",
      "I wash they had the righter today as they had back then The movie made me laugh from beginning to end. I rate it a 10.\n",
      "My all time dysfunctional family movie. Funny, even zany, but sweet and emotional (for a second). What do YOU think Margo?\n",
      "OK; so it's not \"It's a Wonderful Life\", but it's really funny and did not seem dated. Chevy and Randy really hold up!\n",
      "Love this movie! Watch it every year! Super funny and entertaining!! Love Chevy Chase, he's a great actor and very funny!\n",
      "This is the best christmas movie. We watch it every year. We just got a new big screen TV and had to have this movie on DVD.\n",
      "A Christmas tradition in my family since the eighties. Hilarious!  A young Chevy Chase at his Clark W Griswold best.\n",
      "A comedy and holiday classic. The combination of physical comedy paired with stereotypical family gathering nightmare scenarios make for a movie you can watch again and again and still laugh out loud. Our family watches it every Christmas as a kick off to the holidays.\n",
      "one of my all-time holiday favorites, this movie is a must-have.Now i will be able to watch this movie all december long\n",
      "Classic refreshing comedy  Chevy Chase was made for this movie and all who acted in it.  Laugh out loud type of film.\n",
      "Every Christmas we watch this movie. I especially like the  scene when Chevy Chase rides the saucer with the family watching. Fun for the whole family.\n",
      "Chevy Chase stars as Clark Griswold, a family man who's determined to have a wonderful Christmas for his family. From the 25,000 lights on the house, an embarrassing cousin, a Christmas tree going up in flames, a squirrel getting lose in the house, plus many more mishaps, it's not that simple.It's been somewhat of a tradition in my entire family to watch this movie every year at Christmas and we've been doing so for as long as I can remember. Everybody should own a copy of National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. As it says, \"yule crack up!\"\n",
      "I first saw this movie in the theatre with my Dad when it was released.  He laughed so hard, I thought he was going to have an asthma attack.  I bought the movie and we watch it every year as a tradition.  I have family members who act like Clark Griswald's relatives, so I can actually relate to the characters in this movie (Scary eh?).There are so many great moments of comedy in this movie, the huge Christmas tree, overcooking the turkey until it explodes, and the Yuppie neighbors that despise Clark with a passion.  Chevy Chase is great as the Dad with the high expectations for a great Christmas and of course, the actual event never quite measures up to his hopes.  And that is what makes it funny. I give this one 5 stars.\n",
      "Classic Christmas movie, watch it every year, wish they could make a few more new movies that hit the same chord...\n",
      "This is a true Christmas Classic right here. Must watch every year. Endless lines to quote throughout the holidays and more.\n",
      "It is a perennial favorite and every time I watch it I laugh so hard!  It is a classic enjoyed by all ages!\n",
      "National Lampoon's never fails to amuse us.  While dealing with the stress of the holiday season, it's nice to watch a movie that proves your not alone.  Non-stop laughter.\n",
      "One of my favorite Christmas movies. Makes me laugh every time I watch it. So many quotable lines. A classic!\n",
      "Great movie! I had to buy it again, because the original one got misplaced,(must of been the divorce thing)My Daughter loves that movie, its a holiday tradition to watch it every year, so I bought it for her for one of her Christmas gifts.\n",
      "A real Christmas classic the whole family enjoys. One of the best comedies ever!  Everyone in the family owns a copy. Would highly recommend this movie.\n",
      "So nice to be able to watch when we want.  Wouldn't be holidays without it to watch with turkey dinner.\n",
      "I hadn't watched this movie for years and I had forgotten how funny it is! A classic Christmas flick for all ages.\n",
      "great movie can watch over and over never get tired of it.  Chevy chase is great as always  all his moves are great.\n",
      "What is not to love about this classic.  Funny no matter how many times you see it.  Clark is like all of us, just wants to do the right thing and make great memories.  And like for the rest of us, things just never work out as planned, but they do work out.  LOVE this movie.\n",
      "Every year, we think of Christmas Vacation when we decorate our house for Christmas!  This movie has such a great cast of characters!  I call my husband \"Clark\" when he is hanging lights on the outside of our house!!!!  Buy this movie!  You won't be disappointed!!!!\n",
      "For years, this movie has been one of our holiday favorites.  It offers a silly comedic note to offset the other movies we like, such as \"Its a Wonderful Life\".  Wouldn't suggest it for very young children, but it works well for teens and above.\n",
      "AWESOME,AWESOME,AWESOME NOTHING MORE TO SAY BEST CHHRISTMAS MOVIE EVER A MUST HAVE FOR THE HOLIDAYS AWESOME,AWESOME,AWESOME BUY THIS MOVIE AWESOME\n",
      "Classic movie about the holidays.  Love it!  Even my folks who are very conservative, they could relate...\n",
      "This was sooo entertaining and fun!  This is a movie you can watch over and over and still be entertained.\n",
      "One of the best National Lampoon's movies.  Something about the stress during the holidays and watching this movie takes it away.\n",
      "Christmas Lampon Vacation.  Got it quickly and the nastalogia of it priceless it;s a modern Christmas classic one that is tiereless to watch and everyone has someone to be reminded of in the family.\n",
      "All all-time favorite!  I like watching this one even when it's not Christmas!  Everyone should have this in their holiday movie repertoire.\n",
      "Very funny humor filled movie, I watch this movie every Christmas.  A family friendly movie and I highly recommend it.\n",
      "One of my favorite Christmas movies.  The best of the Vacation series.  Cousin Eddie is a hoot.If you like over the top comedy, you will love this movie.\n",
      "i love this movie, I barely see it at Christmas & now I own it. it arrived in great condition.\n",
      "Love this Christmas comedy. Sure to make you laugh.  Bought this for both of my girls to start their own family memories.\n",
      "Not young kids. Classic Christmas movie tradition. Funny each year. Looking for perfection (as well all want) and getting reality instead.\n",
      "I have to watch this at least once every Christmas. Very funny and will remind you of your own favorite Christmas family memories.\n",
      "funny Christmas story and funny family. good family fun for the entire family everyone will enjoy it. a good story.\n",
      "All time Christmas classic.  The ONLY bad part is that Chevy Chase drops the \"f\" bomb in the movie once.  Unnecessary.\n",
      "Fun movie for the holidays. Funny and good actors. This is one of the classic funny movies to watch during the holidays.\n",
      "a nice relief from the holidyas.  bad situations made worse by Clark Griswold and his bad decisions.  funny, funny, funny.\n",
      "This is one of few that I have to watch every year it's just as funny each time I see it\n",
      "Movie is funny I still remember when I was little and watched it. Christmas time is the best time tv\n",
      "This movie is a family tradition in our household. I can't imagine a Christmas Holiday without sitting as a family and enjoying this movie.  It's not deep, it's not rocket-science, it just makes you laugh and relate to the stress of the season while reinforcing the Holidays are meant for family -time.....regardless of how functional they may or may not be.\n",
      "The stars are for the tear-spilling laughter it reliably induces; the loss of the fifth star is for the over-the-top ending with the S.W.A.T. team, but I've reached my laughing catharsis limit by then anyway, so no big deal.\n",
      "We loved the moved and was very pleased with ourpurchase. I order from amazon often am always pleasedwith the quality of my purchase.\n",
      "For many years my youngest son has watched this movie on Christmas Eve.  This past Thanksgiving he had a fire in his home and this movie was no more, and I just had to get it for him.\n",
      "Best movie ever!  Even if one is feeling down, just watching this makes you laugh and forget your problems for a little while.  Just so funny.\n",
      "Funny comedy.  Silly humor.  Chevy and his wife are a riot!  Watch if you want a good laugh.  Ha ha.\n",
      "This one is probably the best one out of all the National Lampoons series.The first one is a classic movie as well,but christmas vacation tops them all in my opinion.Every christmas season I watch this one ,it's funny from the beginning to the end.A surprise visit from Clark's cousin Eddy makes this movie even funnier.I think cousin Eddy made this one a classic,Imean with out cousin  Eddy it wouldn't be as funny.This is a must own for every National Lampoon's fan.\n",
      "A classic and a movie a lot of us can relate to at one time or another to varying degrees.\n",
      "Hey! If any of you are looking for any last-minute gift ideas for anyone, give them this.Tis the season to be merry.\n",
      "It is a classic.  Friends quote some of their favorite lines, and soon everyone is laughing and quoting more.  It wouldn't be Christmas without it.\n",
      "Few funnier movies than this; every viewing.  A little concerned, based on some of the reviews, that the video and/or sound quality of this DVD might be substandard, but overall, it's fine.  The video jittered a little on the intro., which is a cartoon, but that quickly resolved and from there on, the video quality is very good; maybe not the best HD Blu-ray, but obviously one.  The soundtrack isn't all that great; 2-channel and sound levels aren't totally consistent (might have to adjust the volume once in a while to hear the voice track), but it's okay overall.  Bottom line, great movie, really good video, acceptable audio.  We'll be watching this one every holiday season.\n",
      "This movie is as ridiculous and funny as the first time I saw it. Classic Chevy Chase, it just never gets old.\n",
      "This is a movie that our family watches every holiday.  We can identify a piece of Griswald in our personalities.\n",
      "Nice movie to watch every year!  It's one of those movies that's a classic and belong in every household.  Funny!\n",
      "What's not to love about this Christmas classic? I watch it every year at Christmas and also at least once or twice during the year. Way too funny.\n",
      "Clark Griswold is the quintessential \"boy who never grows up,\" an idealistic dreamer with sky-high expectations and wide-eyed innocence. Anticipating a hefty bonus from his employer, he places an order for a swimming pool, invites his parents and in-laws to his home, and eagerly looks forward to enjoying an old-fashioned \"family Christmas.\"Of course, everything goes horribly wrong--the tree, the lights, family squabbles, snooty neighbors, a coldhearted boss and an unexpected visit from Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid is priceless). All of the mayhem wears on poor Clark until he finally snaps...the result of his \"breakdown\" is complete comic bliss.This Griswold saga is second only to the original \"Vacation\" as the funniest movie in this series. Next time you feel overwhelmed by the \"stress\" of the Holiday Season, pop this movie into the VCR and relax; your subsequent laughter will be the perfect elixir to cure any holiday blues.\n",
      "I agree with reviewers who say this is the best of the vacation series, and I never get tired of watching this movie.  While it seems a little tame and not quite as outrageous by today's standards, it has lost nothing in the way of hilarity over the years since it was first released.  There are scenes that will stick with you for years, and bring some good chuckles long after you've seen it.  For me the best example of this is the squirrel in the tree fiasco, with the ensuing freakouts among the family, and Chevy Chase waging war on the little thing.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and watch it again at every opportunity I get.  Many of my friends who don't like slapstick so much also did not like this movie...so be warned, if you don't see the humor in stuff like the 3 Stooges, you may not enjoy this as much as I did.\n",
      "All time best movie for the Holidays - You will laugh, cry and everything in between with this movie. Makes a wonderful gift for the next generation to watch and enjoy\n",
      "A holiday classic at its rip roaringest best with Chevy Chase doing his best of the Lampoon Vacation movies with Randy Quaid making it even wilder.\n",
      "This is a must see every Christmas season. Contains the movie and the option of commentary from some of the cast members that you can listen to as you watch the movie. Otherwise, there are no other extras on the DVD menu, which I wasn't planning on anyway.\n",
      "Our family loves this movie, it's a tradition at Christmas.  Lots of stupid laughs, and Eddie is typical of anybody's relative.\n",
      "I have to watch this every Christmas actually several times. It is funny it is corny, but also has the meaning of Christmas.\n",
      "i use to watch it all ta time when i was younger great lv it lv lv lv funny lv\n",
      "What a must-have DVD! Love this movie and have for years. We purchased the DVD to take the place of our old VCR copy. This movie is a must, especially during the holiday season!\n",
      "All time Classic. An ORIGINAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Way too funny of a movie. That is why this move is a CLASSIC. GREAT.\n",
      "I won't be able to say anything new here so I won't try but this movie is a must see every Christmas.\n",
      "Very funny! Really captured the Christmas season in a funny way. It is on my list of must watch Christmas movies. My kids saw it for the first time and loved it. Truly a classic.\n",
      "Favorite movie of all time! Watch it every Christmas! It never gets old, and always find something new in it!\n",
      "An annual classic we don't miss.  We watch this movie during the Christmas Season and we get into the Christmas Spirit.\n",
      "Very, very funny holiday film.  Clark has a bit of all Dads everywhere in his character and there are so many relatable, yet thankfully exagerated, moments in this film that you would need to be the ultimate scrooge to not get a good laugh out of this. The perfect antidote to the more sentimental holiday offerings and a damn good time!\n",
      "We have seen several times and it is still Finney.  If you want Finney slap stick for Christmas enjoyment it is for you.  It does have more bad language in it then I remembered, maybe I have seen it before on TV where it was cleared up a bit.  But still I would watch again.\n",
      "Keeping the tradition of our own personal Griswold Christmas this was a gift to other family members. Enjoyed by all!\n",
      "All of our family members have loved this movie ever since it came out. It is definitely a Christmas classic.\n",
      "If you want to laugh, watch National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. It's one of the best christmas movies I have seen in a long time.  Funny, Funny, Funny!!!!!\n",
      "It does not matter how many times I see this movie I still LOL at the faces that Chevy makes as he gets himself in mishap after mishap. A great movie to share with your grandchildren.... LOL together for The Holidys\n",
      "This movie is one of my families' favorites year round. Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) tries his best to have a nice family Christmas get together. But, everything thing he attempts from cutting down the family Christmas  tree, putting up the lights, getting them to light, spending his bonus he  never receives, hosting family members that don't get along, fails!You  will watch this time and time again as we do.\n",
      "One of the Geatest Movies Ever,this is a Classic Comedy a must have! I would recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys Comedy!\n",
      "Love watching this even in the middle of summer. This is a classic and as far as I'm concerned it will never go out of style.\n",
      "Our family holiday tradition since the 1980's. Sure beats It's a Wonderful Life and all those other Christmas schlock movies that seem to run 24/7 on all channels every December. Cousin Eddie rules.\n",
      "The best Christmas movie ever, hands down, Clark W Griswald is the man!!! Cousin Eddie, well what can you say it's cousin Eddie at his best!!!\n",
      "Arguably one of the best Christmas movies ever made.  Chevy Chase has created a holiday tradition with this hysterical 90-minute holiday favorite.\n",
      "This movie is a timeless classic that makes me laugh every time I see it. No family is perfectly normal and this movie plays on the strangeness of the relatives as well as all the pressures we face during the holidays. It has a good message and a lot of humor along the way.\n",
      "I absolutely love this movie!  I can't imagne anyone who is a christmas lover not having this movie in their dvd options.  Very funny.  An oldie but a goodie :)\n",
      "I watched it years ago in the theater but I had to have a copy so that periodically I could revisit the comedy of Chevy Chase.  I laughed till tears rolled.  The 10 second monologue Chase recites about his boss are priceless.\n",
      "yeah so not only is every line quotable, but almost every line is laughable.  Truly a classic movie any day.\n",
      "The best of the NL seriesAn annual holiday must !Chevy Chase is much under ratedOne of my top ten comedies of all time\n",
      "One has to love this Blu Ray version of a great Christmas classic.  Great picture and sound - a must have for the Blu-ray player.\n",
      "hilarious and touching from start to endif you like Randy Quaid and Chevy Chase and Beverly D' Angelo.then see this movieit's worth the many laughs I get every time I play it on my dvd playerit will be a hilarious touching Christmas tale 90 years from nowit was made in the 80s or 90's and it's 2005 and people still love it. some movies never die with the famdom. I mean stardom. this is just one of many examples. I saw this once on tv. once in high school for English Class and 2 times already on dvd. glad I bought this. and glad I saw it\n",
      "Chevy Chase's best role as Clark Griswold. The bumbling well-intented Clark tries to give his family the ultimate Christmas experience but is met with one disaster after another.  Chevy is supported by an outstanding cast including the insane antic's of Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid).  Must watch at least once every Christmas.\n",
      "I enjoyed the movie before but it is so much better with Blue Rays. I didn't believe it could be any funnier.  I still feel bad for the Cat.\n",
      "Big fan of this movie, have been for years. Was happy to see it in a hard case. Well packaged, nice hard case, fast shipping.\n",
      "Get togethers with family and friends are a fun part of the holidays, but they certainly come with some yule-tide stress. Watching Clark Griswald navigate his family and a fairly rough series of events made the slight bumps in my holiday road a lot easier to handle. Previously, I'd only seen the scaled back \"for TV\" version and I have to say I've been missing out!\n",
      "Clark does everything wrong for the right reasons.What a supporting cast. Cousin Eddie is...just Cousin Eddie.Love Elaine Benes as Clark's next door neighbor.\n",
      "I have laughed at this film days after watching.  I think it\"s very good.It is a hoot. The best Christmas movie.\n",
      "This is a great Christmas classic. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh around the holidays.\n",
      "This is a perfect entry in the vacation series.  It is packed with howls of laughter.  This movie will have you rolling on your floor laughing like you've never laughed before.  But.....just because it's a christmas movie doesn't really mean it's a kids holiday movie.  I don't really know if it's ok for your kids to watch, I mean, i let my kdis watch it and they laughed really hard, but it did have crude humor and some pretty fowl language.  You better watch it first and make a choise.  Anyway, this special edition is quite nice.  With a very entertaining commentary with the griswalds and alot of other special features, it's well worth the price.  Go ahead and get it.  You won't be dissapointed\n",
      "Classic...that is enough said about this movie.  There really are not words - it never gets old!!!!! Classic - as I said!\n",
      "Replaced my old VHS tape with the DVD.  It's a must have for Xmas movies!\n",
      "Along with It's a Wonderful Life, this is my favorite movie of all time. I love Christmas time and love to laugh ...this movie is hilarious!!! I can watch it 10 times a season and laugh every time.\n",
      "This is a typical american movie, letting people understand the true mean of christmas, or broadly the holidays.Amid this movie, there are typical american humors which on the one hand increase the happy feeling of the holiday, on the other hand, which is more importantly, enhance the art effect of this movie that it really wants to convey to the audience.IT's a great movie, deserving watching in this very time of Christmas Holiday. Merry Christmas, everybody!\n",
      "I have bought this in VHS & DVD. This is the first one I bought on Blu-Ray and it is much better. I have bought this movie over 8 times already but this is the first Blu-Ray.\n",
      "This is a funny movie, me and my 14 year old son loved it. Full of laughs! I highly recommend it!!!\n",
      "Like others here, I really enjoyed Christmas Vacation, and I thought it was very funny.  My favorite scene was when Clark calls his boss every name he can think of when he doesn't get his bonus.  (Who wrote that?)  I agree that this is a pretty basic DVD with hardly any extras.  Instead of production notes, I would like to see deleted scenes and especially bloopers!  However, I do not believe this movie needs to be widescreen, and I am a big fan of widescreen formatted movies.  The fact is, there are two kinds of widescreen: anamorphic, which has an aspect ratio of 2.35:1, and Academy Flat, which is 1.85:1.  Christmas Vacation is of the latter type.  Academy Flat movies are actually filmed in an aspect ratio very close to television anyway, 1.33:1, and later cropped in the theater during projection.  So a full screen version of an Academy Flat movie is actually showing you more than what was in the theater.  Academy Flat is really not that wide, so you're not adding a lot to the experience when you get a widescreen version.  That's why many Academy Flat DVD's are released full screen.\n",
      "This was sent to me on time and in good condition. I was satisified with my purchase.\n",
      "If you've never seen it, you've missed out. I honestly can't remember a conversation I've had about Christmas and movies that there isn't some reference to or from this movie, even with strangers. You will laugh until you cry.\n",
      "I bought the gift/tin set here on Amazon with the DVD, coasters and the Santa cap, which I wore during my last viewing of the movie a few nights back... a most excellent purchase! This is a must see for fans of the National Lampoon's genre or anyone who enjoys seeing a father trying his best to give his family the perfect Christmas with things going wrong pretty much at ever turn. I don't want to go into much more detail than that but I do suggest checking it out or watch again... still funny and entertaining even after a second viewing, or third viewing, or maybe just watch around the holiday season? Enjoy.\n",
      "This is one of those movies you just have toPull out each year.  It is a Christmas staple, I never miss it!!!\n",
      "I own this movie on DVD as part of the Vacation 4-disc set.  I think it's awesome.  It's a roller coaster ride from beginning to end.I love the antics that Chevy Chase pulls off in this film.  Particularly the scene where he's hanging from the gutter, and the block of ice comes flying out the end, which crashes through his neighbor's window.As far as Randy Quaid and his faction of the family is concerned, again awesome antics.  The scene where Snots chases the squirrel around the dining room is pure hilarity.  I laugh just by thinking about it.One of my all time holiday songs appears on the soundtrack of this film.  I'm referring to Mele Kalikimaka, which was recorded by Bing Crosby.If you love holiday classics, love the Griswolds, or are a serious collector like myself, I recommend getting your hands on this movie.  Come join me on a Christmas Vacation :-)\n",
      "A good and hilarious movie seen every year. Only reason for a four is for the fact that I don't think the movie was as clear as it should be for Blu-ray. Had moments of fuzzyness. Still, with that being said, it was better then the regular DVD.\n",
      "I don't know what people are thinking giving this 1 and 2 stars. Chevy Chase is a comedic genius!! His delivery and Improv ability is spot on! He has a way of delivering an otherwise boring line that makes anything he says funny! This man can make a comedy out of reading the PHONE BOOK!Christmas Vacation reunites Chevy Chase and Beverley D'Angelo as they decide to hold Christmas Festivities at their house this year. When the two sides of the family come together, it's not Auld Lang Syne. It's not a \"Wonderful\" Life but it's a WONDERFULLY Hilarious Holiday Romp!! An undeniable part of my holiday tradition.\n",
      "The entire \"vacation\" series has been a good reason to laugh, maybe because there is a little reality and a lot of craziness in each movie.  The Christmas Vacation presents all of the kind of things we deal with during the holidays and a bunch we never thought of.  The cast does a great job lead by Chevy Chase.  I look forward to seeing this movie each year, just as I do for Miracle on 34th Street.  These two movies are about as different as you can get but both very enjoyable during th eholiday season.\n",
      "First of all, to all the nit-picky reviewers complaining about the lack of widescreen or more special features, the special edition of this movie just came out. So go get that, and spare us your tired diatribes.Now, onto the movie. To me and my family, nothing says \"christmas\" like Christmas Vacation. In my house, it is NOT the holiday season until we've watched it a couple of times. It's a holiday classic, not to mention a comedy classic. It reminds me a lot of christmas at my house. It's the best christmas movie ever made. Period. END OF SENTENCE!!We all remember the Griswolds, don't we? Well, it's christmastime, and Clark (Chevy Chase) wants nothing more for his family than the best christmas ever. Of course, if your IQ is higher than your shoe size, then you should know it's not exactly smooth sailing. Burnt-out bulbs, oversized trees, and Ellen's wacky Cousin Eddie are just a few of the many mishaps along the way to the 25th. So many memorable scenes, so many memorable lines. (Check out the scene where Clark encounters a VERY attractive saleslady in a department store while shopping for lingerie. Priceless.)All in all, this movie IS christmas in my household, and it should be in yours. Definitely buy this on DVD. Don't even think, just do it.\n",
      "Great movie for the holiday.  I haven't seen this in a while.  One of the classics if you want to enjoy comedy over the holidays.\n",
      "Arrived on time and is a must have for all holiday collections.  Bought the standard dvd so as it can be watched wherever i am visiting.\n",
      "My boyfriend and I watch this every year around Christmas, but this year it wasn't being played on Netflix. I knew this would be the perfect Christmas gift. I just had to give it to him early!\n",
      "As one of  the top three on our list to purchase right after we recently bought our BlueRay player, we highly recommend it for delightful comedy.  Some many great characters and gags and lines with impeccable timing - doesn't get much better.\n",
      "I had this movie for use with a VCR which isn't working properly in my home. It was delivered before Christmas and enhanced our holiday fun.\n",
      "Even the traditional National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation marathon which is on every holiday season isn't enough viewing for this movie.  I have a copy in Houston at my house, but am in California for a while.  I couldn't live without the movie.  I watch it all year long.  Chevy Chase has never been funnier, and the cast is soooo perfect.  If anyone has any holiday depression over anyone and anything, this movie makes life a lot more cheerful!\n",
      "Loved this movie when I was a kid, and now my kids love it too. We watch it every Christmas at our summer home, kind of a tradition now.\n",
      "Good music which was enjoyed by all.  Brought back some old family memories. This music is a classic. Good for family listening.\n",
      "Generations of my family have loved this movie. At Christmastime, my father used to sit down everyone who walked through our door to watch this movie. My brother would always get teary during the scene where Clark is  stuck in the attic watching old home movies. Now I have the DVD copy, my  little 4 year old son has just discovered it and thinks it very funny. The  quality of the DVD picture is spectacular. Although I have seen this movie  too many times to count, I have never seen the picture so clear and  sharp.The wonderful thing about the DVD is that I can never wear out  another copy of this movie!\n",
      "I send it as a gift to my son who could have Christmas without it. He enjoyed all the memories of home, ha ha ha\n",
      "Watched this movie several times and I still enjoy it.  Chevy Chase is a really funny guy -  Still makes me laugh!\n",
      "I really enjoyed this movie and we consider it a *relatively* new classic.  Unfortunately, though, there are a couple of scenes that have unnecessary sexual undertones (or overtones?), and one scene where profanity is used in an excessive manner. The great thing about DVD's is you can skip those unwanted scenes.  For the most part, though, we really enjoy the movie because it shows the joy in family Christmases together.  It also reminds us that we all have our own *challenges* with family.\n",
      "\"I'll try not to.\"Classic. Its a miracle I don't wet myself everytime I see this its so funny. I'm not a big Chevy Chase fan, but in this, he makes everything click.I love the yuppie neighbors who are constantly being sarcastic with each other. Makes you realize that as nuts as the Grizwalds are, the world is worse.\n",
      "This movie is a must watch every christmas, as the chaos that ensues brings you to laugh your behind off.\n",
      "This movie is a Christmas classic.  Everyone needs to see it. I guarantee you will laugh your jolly little butt off.\n",
      "This is an awesome classic holiday movie that is so much like every family just trying to have the best Christmas. Must watch for every holiday season.\n",
      "Considering there are many holiday movies out there, this one for me tops it off.  I guess since me and my dad have always been Chevy Chase fans, this one tops it off.\n",
      "My brother goes Christmas crazy when it comes to decorating and when I found out he hadn't seen the movie I had to get it for him because he is absolutely griswald!\n",
      "YOU MUST ADD THIS TO YOUR MOVIES FOR CHRISTMAS...IT IS FUNNY...IT IS WONDERFUL...GREAT MOVIE...FUNNY....MAKES YOU REMEMBER THAT YOUR FAMILY IS NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT HAVE A CRAZY CHRISTMAS GATHERING\n",
      "This one is a great installment to the series.  A what if the family vacations with you at Christmas time!  More hilarious fun and tons of familiar faces to go around.  Quaid is back in this installment.\n",
      "Classic watch each Christmas.  Almost have it memorized now but the family as to see it each Christmas season.  Have a hap - hap - happy Christmas.\n",
      "This is the original zany Christmas comedy. From the beginning road race to the outrageous climax,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (Special Edition)will have you laughing out loud. Many movies have copied the jokes in this movie (especially the ultra-bright Christmas lights, which was copied inDeck the Halls),National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (Special Edition)is the original and still the best.\n",
      "Enjoyed this very much. Great family movie would recommend to any one liking Christmas  movies. Would watch this movie again.\n",
      "My family is sure to include this in our count down to christmas celebration!!e mail me if you're interested about this celebration!!\n",
      "Family classic!! Love the movie always love watching it!! Have watched it as a tradition and will always watch it!\n",
      "This is the funniest Christmas movie ever made.  No matter how many times I have seen it, it's not enough.The scene with the squirrel still gets me laughing until it hurts.  I even put a fake squirrel in my Christmas tree every year because of this movie.\n",
      "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation . . . what can I say? It's a comedy classic! It's yet another film that you can enjoy during the holiday season. It's also the best National Lampoon motion picture that features the Griswolds. It has a cleverly written script, interesting characters, and the true definition of family gatherings (well, maybe not ENTIRELY true, but true nonetheless). But I think the best part of this film is the humor. There are so many sight gags and witty dialogue that anyone can remember off the top of their heads. The most memorable scenes include bringing the humongous Christmas tree into the house, the dry turkey, the squirrel, the awkward talk with a female salesperson, and of course, \"s****er was full!\". While it may not be one of my all-time favorite films, it's still one of the greatest Christmas films of all time. You can watch it along with It's A Wonderful Life, A Christmas Story, Miracle on 34th Street, Elf, Home Alone, A Charlie Brown Christmas, Scrooge, Scrooged, A Garfield Christmas, How The Grinch Stole Christmas, etc etc etc etc etc etc etc.Grade: A\n",
      "This is perhaps the best Vacation film--any time of the year! Although others were complaining about the special features, and no deleted scenes that they saw on tv, I got what I paid for. I would do it again, and if you haven't seen it, rent it. I don't care what time of the year it is; any time's a good time for Christmas Vacation. Thank you for taking the time to read my review and feel free to leave helpful/not helpful feedback.\n",
      "The best national lampoon vacation movie. Classic Chevy chase movie, lots of laughs, the best ever. Family friendly, kids loved it\n",
      "I could quote this movie all day long and so can my kids!  This is a great Christmas classic with a good story and really rich/funny characters.  It feels like Christmas as soon as the theme song comes on so we've been known to watch it all through the year just to brighten our moods.  The language gets a little dicey VERY occasionally but all in all this is safe for the kids and funny for all.  If you don't have this on your must watch Christmas list then you should get it there.  I wish I could give it 6 stars.\n",
      "This is hands down the best Christmas movie off all time. Pretty sure I could recite the entire thing. Everyone from kids to adults will be laughing the whole time! Definitely a holiday classic, buy it now!\n",
      "What more can i say than its a classic! Its funny and just about everyone has seen it and loves it. So old school....\n",
      "This is an annual \"must see\" ritual for the. family.  A classic that should be a part of your library.\n",
      "Chevy Chase is a stone nut case. I love most of his movies if not all. This one is the funniest I seen in a long time. I have this one for sure. Love to watch around Christmas time.\n",
      "Love it, Love it.  My family enjoys watching this movie every Christmas.  What can i say, we love the movie.\n",
      "It's a great, funny movie--watch it every year around Christmas!  If you want a good laugh, buy this movie.  You'll get your monies worth!\n",
      "A holiday tradition. Don't want to be without this! Everyone loves it! One of the funniest movies ever. Everyone needs this movie!\n",
      "We watch this every year around Christmas - it has become a family tradition and it was time to buy the DVD.  This movie is always good for a laugh during the holiday season\n",
      "Natinal Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is one of the BEST Christmas movies that I've seen in my LIFE!!! Chevy Chase, there is no other or comparsion. I watch this movie throughout the year. I moved late Oct. 2010 and could not find my dvd. So, I had to purchase another one. Although, I watch it throughout the year, I had to purchase it before Christmas, because my Christmas just would not be the same without it! It is hilarious!!! Go Get It!!!\n",
      "This movie is perfect to watch during Christmas! Chevy Chase ends up going crazy after trying to give his family the perfect Christmas. You will love this movie!\n",
      "This is one of my top five favorite movies, regardless of time of year.  And now that it is available on Blu-Ray, I am so happy to have such a high quality of this content to relive the years of watching this.  Brings back great memories and the cast performances and situations are timeless even though this movie is 25 years old.\n",
      "This movie is wonderful. It's a dysfunctional family Christmas movie. That's what's lovely about it. It doesn't set unattainable movie standards. And in the end everyone is happy, jolly, and it's evident that Christmas cheer is in the air.\n",
      "This movie is perfect for me: hilarious, inappropriate and Christmas-y. I don't go a season without watching it! Luckily, I now own it on DVD and will never miss it.\n",
      "Great humor in every scene.  It is a family tradition to watch this movie after our Thanksgiving meal.  Sound track is great as well.\n",
      "Funny as heck. This is a classic Christmas movie at the top of the list.  Puts A Christmas Story to shame.\n",
      "We watch this every year!  The grandchildren love it although we have to distract them from a few words and gestures!\n",
      "One of the best Christmas movies there is and I watch it multiple times during the holiday season. Will keep watching it every year!\n",
      "Love this movie!! Have been watching it for years. If you are a Chevy Chase fan& love Comedy, this is the movie for you. You will want to watch it over & over again & won't stop laughing till the end.\n",
      "A movie that enriches christmas experience . Very funny, my wife and kids love it. We love watching it over and over again\n",
      "La verdad es justo que saquen esta pelicula de dvd para todos los aficionados de las secuelas de  \"National Lampoons Vacation\" La primera vez que vi la pelicula fue en Diciembre de 1999 en HBO por satellite y tuve que volverla a ver en su funcion de la hora oeste (West) ya que me encanto pienso que Chevy Chase es uno de los mejores actores de comedia en su genero.ojala y pronto podamos ver en cine otra secuela de estas peliculas, ya que cada diciembre veo en mi casa varias veces esta pelicula y no me canso de disfrutarla.Espero filmen pronto National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation II  con Chevy Chase!!!Fernando Martinez\n",
      "This is my official Christmas film. My holidays are never without at least one viewing. Chevy Chase, the consummate family man, tries his darnedest to pull off a good old fashioned family Christmas. The film follows his hi jinks, misteps & hysterical one liners with strangers, co workers & family and with all the laughs, it stills manages to warm your heart.\n",
      "Clark W. Griswald finally has all his chips in order. He's got a christmas vacation all planned out and a nice juicy chirstmas bonus coming to him. But things go awry when his cousin comes down to visit, when their tree keeps on having to be replaced, and when the relatives start coming over. It's a classic holdiay bumble comedy that doesn't stop with the slapstick or the unforgetable screwy scenerio's. This is one comedy that's good for the whole family to enjoy. Rnady quiad plays the excelent free-loader who just can't get enough of taking advantage of Clark's hospitality.Deck the halls with laughter with this one as you watch this simple holiday rest spin into an uncontrolabe christmas that no one is going to forget.Enjoy!\n",
      "This is a classic in the national lampoon series.  If you liked \"wally world\" you are sure to love this.\n",
      "This is the one movie I watch every year to start my Christmas spirit.  Gives me the sense of what the holiday is about and just a good family laugh\n",
      "We forgot how funny this movie is!!!  Timeless!!! Will watch it again and again and again.  Chevy Chase is amazingly talented...and Randy Quaid....hilarious...\n",
      "It's Vacation, come on!  Well, ok.  Vegas Vacation was a bit of miss but this one is too funny and every family can see a little of their own family in this at some point\n",
      "We watch Christmas Vacation every Christmas, it's Tradition.  This DVD is great quality and packaged well.  Not much else to report!\n",
      "The third and best of the Chevy Chase-National Lampoon series kicks off with Clark Griswold hosting this year's Christmas celebration.  Of course, that means lots of family, welcome or otherwise, showing up at his door.  Randy Quaid, playing cousin Eddie, shows up at Clark's home with his R.V., a total heap.  Clark does his best to have a good time, but nothing goes right.  He's brought to the breaking point with annoying relatives, Chistmas lights that refuse to work, and a bonus that causes him to flip out.Christmas Vacation is a laugh a minute.  You know people liked the movie when they keep repeating some of the one-liners.  Here's some of my favorites:\"You couldn't hear a dump truck driving through a nitro-glycerin plant.\"\"We're going to have the hap, hap, happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap-danced with Danny F-n Kay.\"\"That there's a quality item.\"I watch this movie every year, usually right after Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  Not to be missed.\n",
      "One of the best Christmas comedies around.  There is some adult language so I wouldn't let the little kids watch it.A great movie to start the Christmas season off.\n",
      "Funny timeless classic, Chevy Chase at his best with the Hilarious Randy Quaid!Great cast!  Amazon seller fast shipping and professional!\n",
      "We already have this movie but bought it for our daughter who loves it just as much as we do.\n",
      "I haven't tried this video yet and probably won't for a while. Hopefully it will work, I just wanted to add it to my collection and only had it on a VHS.\n",
      "Love thismovie it's a great comic relief during the holidays. Everyone loves a family fun holiday movie where everything goes wrong.\n",
      "One of the funniest movies ever made. Has become out family tradition to watch it at least once a year.\n",
      "A must see every year, at least for older kids and adults.  Right up there with Miracle, Elf, and Wonderful Life.\n",
      "This is a great movie.  I never get tired of watching it - even all during the year.  I laugh every time I watch it.\n",
      "Nothing is more fun than watching the crazy Griswold Chistmas with the family anytime of the year!  Love this movie!\n",
      "I had the entire National Lampoon's Vacation series except for this one. So I finally broke down and ordered it. Now they're everywhere. But that doesn't matter as I love this movie. It has become required viewing as part of our Christmas movies, and the kids love it.\n",
      "Great Christmas comedy that has become a classic! A fun way to spend an evening during the holidays. I highly recommend this movie!\n",
      "This is a fantastic movie. It is a Christmas Classic! Can't wait to watch it again next season with the family.\n",
      "Always a good movie, especially when shown full length as this version is, but the best are the surprizes in the commentary where the director and cast members provide information on many different scenes and answer some questions that have always been nagging in my mind, like, where did they find a ski slope to go sledding in Chicagoland?  And who's picture is that on the People magazine that Clark carefully positions for the camera in the bedroom scene.  This is the version I've been waiting for!\n",
      "This is a must have movie. Very funny. I orderded 2.One for myself and one for a friend.\n",
      "Heartwarming in the way that only classic comedy can be! Wish they still wrote scripts like this- the jokes never get old-\n",
      "THIS IS A STUPID, FUNNY MOVIE WHICH OUR FAMILY ENJOYS EVERY CHRISTMAS.  EVERYONE CAN FIND SOMEONE IN THEIR FAMILY SOMEWHERE IN THIS MOVIE. FROM THE UNEXPECTED COMPANY, TO THE DINNER THAT DOESN'T TURN OUT JUST RIGHT TO THE LIGHTS THAT WORKED UNTIL THEY WERE PUT ON THE TREE, OR WORSE YET, ON THE ROOF.  WE PUT IT ON THE TV AND LET IT PLAY THROUGH ONCE OR TWICE ON CHRISTMAS.  WE STILL LAUGH EACH AND EVERY YEAR AT THE SAME PARTS.\n",
      "Even if you aren't a fan of the Griswolds, you can still enjoy this because who HASN'T had the Family Holiday Gathering From Hell at least once???? Proving that family can be so embarrassing, lowlife in-law Randy Quaid shows up with the not-so-near-and-dear to spend Christmas, the senile aunt..they're all there, including the rabid squirrel in the Christmas tree. This is entertainment for everyone, especially those of us who want to see the holidays depicted as they really are, not like in \"A Christmas Carol.\"\n",
      "best of the best this Is thedefinition of funny.Chevy Chase at his best.Very very funny stuff. The story is every alpha males dream.\n",
      "I watch this movie at least once a year - especially when it seems like Christmas is too far away.  I never cease to laugh at it because it reminds me of so much that I have done myself in Christmases past.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite movies so I was excited to get it for such a great price on Amazon!\n",
      "This move has been part of our family Christmas tradition for years.  We watch it several times during the season.  It is just hysterical !!!  Another great quirky Christmas move is \"The Ref\" with Denis Leary...also hysterical !!I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants some laughs !!\n",
      "This is a tradition.  Wanted to have one in the family so we did not have tr rely on watching one on TV.  Great entertainment!\n",
      "This movie is an all time favorite to watch if you love Christmas and enjoy a real good laugh. You won't be sorry if you rent or buy this one it never gets old and you'll look forward to the holiday season just to see it again.\n",
      "Funny light hearted hilarious Christmas movie. Shows the meaning of giving at Christmas.  Also shows the lesson of expectation of Christmas gifts.\n",
      "This movie is a Christmas favorite and contains many funny scenes and situations which many people actually face during their lifetime.  Really funny and great acting.\n",
      "I love this movie. It is played every year during Christmas at my house. I especially love it in HD.\n",
      "This is a Christmas classic and my son and I watch it together every year for the past 12 years and now he and his son are watching it.  It is a great change of pace during the very busy holiday times.\n",
      "This is one that always gets watched at least once before or around Christmas. A real Classic and always makes us laugh time and time again.\n",
      "this movie was one of yhe best ever and it should have gooten a better rating. my family really like it\n",
      "Superb classic. Especially around the holidays. Outlandish and silly but a perfect Christmas movie. A must watch for every family.\n",
      "Just my opinion, but the greatest Christmas comedy of all time. \"Clark Griswold\" made four movies, but this is the crown jewel of who Clark really is....a must for your Christmas season viewing!\n",
      "Just like our family! The picture and audio were great. Watch out for squirrels in your tree!! We recommend it!\n",
      "One of the BEST in the Vacation set of movies and one of the BEST Christmas movies as well!  The movie arrived on time, and as promised.  Great Transaction!\n",
      "Every year we say lets buy it.  We love the great lines like, it's called an RV, Clark!  Snot the Dog.\n",
      "A annual Christmas traditional to place the family in the spirit of the season. Have to have the blu-ray version. Classic.\n",
      "I just laugh and laugh every time I watch this movie.  Definitely the best Christmas movie ever mae, and by far the best of the Vacation series.\n",
      "This is undoubtedly the best Christmas movie of all time.  I was not completely impressed by the blu-ray version compared to the regular.\n",
      "I have had this movie on VHS and dvd for years. Blu Ray version is by far the best in picture and sound\n",
      "We never miss a Christmas season without watching this at least once.  Then we find ourselves making reference to it when our guest come for the holidays and share a smile across the table.  WE LOVE THIS MOVIE!\n",
      "what can i say about this movie. so funny love it. my whole family like it.so glad that i brought it.\n",
      "I can never get enough of this movie. I love it every time I watch it with my daughter. Great movie.\n",
      "This is a hilarious movie. Nonstop laughs and a hilarious cast combine to create the most hilarious Christmas comedy ever! I could not stop laughing each time I watched this! It's a very clever movie, a classic. I'm cracking up just thinking about it right now! The funniest person is the old lady that is very disoriented. I love this movie and the DVD is great too! I love the really long trailors for each \"Vacation\" movie. You can relate to this movie, with the snotty neighbors, and the forgotten, dusty gift in the attic. And I'm sure some of you out there can relate to the unexpected guest arriving, much to your displeasure. Chevy Chase's car scene in the beginning reminded me so much of my Dad's driving. You must buy this DVD, it's great. You'll laugh your little snow pants off! This is a must-have for any DVD collector. Also, check out the other DVD's in the \"Vacation\" series. ENJOY!\n",
      "The best Christmas vacation ever! Christmas just wouldn't be the same without Chevy Chase and all the gang for this laugh-out-loud slapstick riot. When the Griswolds (kids played by different people) decide to spend their Christmas vacation at home - they not only deck the halls, but themselves as well.Co-starring in this comic masterpiece are Beverly DeAngelo and Randy Quaid. The best Chase movie since Fletch.\n",
      "Best holiday movie ever, I strive to be more like Clark each year.  Caution, it has some language, not great for little kids.\n",
      "Great holiday movie, a Christmas tradition. Chevy Chase is at his best in this movie.  The gift that keeps giving.\n",
      "Bought this to have on hand for a good laugh. There are movies I only watch once but not this one.\n",
      "Perhaps one of the greatest comebacks in comedy history, this third Vacation is just as funny as the first, almost (ALMOST) erasing memory of Vacation 2, European. Anyway, the Griswolds are staying home for the holidays. Clark (Chevy Chase) has cut down a tree too big for the living room; the in-laws are all invited, except Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid)and his clan, but they show up anyway; and John Hughes has delivered another comic delight.As I said earlier, the Vacation series has an odd history. The first was great, an adult family comedy (yep, it's possible). Then the sequel, European Vacation, was released, with a bad joke for every good joke the first one had. Also, Audrey and Rusty were now played by different actors, neither very good (admittedly, the Rusty and Audrey are different in this, too, but they're effective), and poor Eric Idle (and other British actors) who make appearances.Oh yeah, this is a review of Christmas Vacation. Yeah, this movie is equally funny as the first, a bit less adult, but still throwing in plenty of bad taste, all of it side-splitting. There's a electrocuted kitty, a very special Christmas dinner, a flaming tree, and a sled ride with a trash can lid. There's kidnapping and a squirrel attack for good effect, as well. So if you didn't think it was possible to redeem the Vacation movies, here's proof. Merry Christmas, fans... and burn all copies of European Vacation.\n",
      "Christmas vacationOutstanding movie to watch at Christmas time. You see family interaction in troubles and way to resolve differences.It is a perfect movie.\n",
      "This has to be my favorite movie of all time. We love to watch it all year long. Gotta love Cousin Eddie.\n",
      "funniest Christmas movie ever! the whole crew of actors make this movie an all time funny, very funny favoritegreat for the whole family\n",
      "Chevy Chase always makes me laugh a lot! So silly, but so fun! How could so many bad things happen to a family, and still keep their sense of humor! Lessons to be learned!\n",
      "A classic that we've enjoyed for years. Every time I watch it I see another humorous subtlety that I missed in previous viewings. This movie is packed with such things.The DVD is top quality in visual and audio, and plays flawlessly in our player.\n",
      "This movie is a classic I laugh at it every time I watch it.  This movie was released in 1989 and stars Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Juliette Lewis and many others.  My family and I watch this movie very Christmas Eve party and get a kick out of it.  The DVD should be much better and should re-release it on a Widescreen format and with deleted scenes and many other extras.  This DVD is worth it for the movie alone, it is hilarious but I still wish they would re-release the film on Widescreen.\n",
      "This movie with Chevy Chase is the perfect définition of this acronym : lol . One of the most funny movie i ever saw.\n",
      "This is a classic Christmas flick that still provides lots of laughter after all these years.  Christmas wouldn't be complete without watching it, so I went ahead and bought my own DVD.  I'm sure glad I did.\n",
      "I cannot explain why we still laugh at this movie after having watched it every Christmas Eve for the past 17 years, but we do.Nothing beats Cousin Eddie drinking punch in his special outfit, Clark trying to get those lights to work, or the lovely gift Aunt Bethany brings to Christmas dinner.You'll have Bing Crosby's \"Mele Kalikimaka\" in your stuck in your head after watching \"Christmas Vacation,\" but that's okay because you'll still have a smile on your face.\n",
      "This is always my holiday favorite! It is not Xmas unless the family is gathered around watching this hilarious movie!\n",
      "Great movie. One must view around the Christmas Vacation time :-)  ( 9 more words for review, alsmost there.done) drat\n",
      "I love this move one of Chevy Chase best it's a special Christmas movie and should be on every Christmas shelf. The blue-Ray transfer is spectacular and looks great for such a old movie.\n",
      "From the start just the look on Chase's face made me smile. The rest of the movie was funny from beginning to end.\n",
      "I had not seen it in years and forgotten how funny it was.  It is truly a Christmas classic for the family.\n",
      "Classic movie.  Must watch on DVD for full effect! We watch this movie every year right after Thanksgiving to get us in the Christmas mood.\n",
      "This reminds me of some of our family Christmas events. It's hilarious! This never fails to entertain no matter how old it is.\n",
      "Clark, I don't want to spend the holidays DEAD.....Now part of our annual holiday viewing. Arrived on time and at a fair price...Great job Amazon....again!\n",
      "Perfect for the crazy holiday season!  We could all use a little more Chevy Chase, any time of the year!\n",
      "One of the funniest movies I have ever seen!  I could (and do) watch it over and over.  I especially enjoy it around the Christmas!\n",
      "Great Classic movie but the blu-ray transfer is a little rough. Audio does not sinc well. Still a great movie.\n",
      "This movie has hilarious situations along with hilarious characters...an absolute classic. The best of the National Lampoon movies.  Manages to make our cultural customs both funny and meaningful at the same time.  In spite of the hilarity, there is a sweetness about this movie.\n",
      "This is a fun, holiday \"must have\" movie.  We make it a tradition to watch this as we  decorate the tree, every year !\n",
      "Arrived as stated--new DVD, perfect condition, and with super-fast service.  Our family just has to see this once during the Christmas season!  Always great service from Amazon--books also.\n",
      "I bought this DVD for my dad's birthday. He loves this movie and would not buy it for himself. It is a great movie for the Chevy Chase fan. The DVD came in great condition and arrived before the receiving date.\n",
      "We watch this every year, multiple times around christmas. It is our tradition. We have it on DVD, but the player wasn't hooked up, so I checked Prime and there it was! yeah! very convenient.\n",
      "Always a classic Christmas movie which always cracks me up.  May not be for the little ones, but besides that, it's great!\n",
      "I cant tell you how many times I've quoted one liners from this movie.And how many times I've wanted to give a one year subscription to the jelly of the month club! Thanks for the great memories, Greseball\n",
      "Plenty of films have been made about that magical season of miracles - a time when people are pressured into being happy and jolly, the suicide rate goes up, and relatives are forced to pretend they like each other. In a word: Christmas. \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\" could well be the best (and funniest) film about Christmas ever made.For Clark Griswold, Christmas turns out to be anything but a happy, harmonious affair. Everything goes wrong. The Christmas that Clark envisions becomes a holiday fraught with hilarious mishaps, setbacks and disappointments. Nevertheless, Clark is determined to make this Christmas work.Things don't get any better with the unexpected arrival of cousin Eddie.\"Christmas Vacation\" is a film packed with moments of sheer laughter at Clark's expense. One scene I always think of is Clark getting ready to carve the turkey, with the relatives sitting around the table looking on. It sounds like a common enough picture. But this film takes it to a whole new dimension.If your Christmas is going badly, this film will certainly put things into perspective. This is as close to reality as a Christmas story can get.\n",
      "My family and I watch this movie every year on Christmas Eve after church and dinner. It's still as funny as the first time we watched it.\n",
      "This movie has it all: Comedy, all throughout the movie; Drama, during the kidnap and police scenes,and as Clarke tries to outrun the loons in the pickup truck; adventure, as he goes looking for the perfect tree, etc.  Throughout the whole movie is the strong focus on family. Although this is  an adult-oriented movie, it is still fun for the children. I watch this  movie throughout the year, and laugh at it each and every time I do.  Clarke has never been funnier. This movie is great to watch w/the family,  because of its focus on the family, or all by oneself. Each time I see it,  I am once again back into the midst of the Christmas season, with all the  joy and family that that implies. Get it, watch it and enjoy it. You won't  regret it. I can't wait to buy it on DVD so that I can enjoy the purity of  sound and picture that that medium offers.\n",
      "Quite a few good laughs and some great old regular stars. Watch this every year instead of \"It's a wonderful life\"\n",
      "If you haven't already seen it, you are missing out on a great Christmas tradition!  Great comedy worth watching every holiday season.\n",
      "The funniest christmas comedy ever. This film has something everyone can relate to.The entire family watches it every year together.A great tradition. Try it!\n",
      "I believe everyone know this is a classic Christmas music.  I love the fact Eddy ran out of gas money in Gurnee.  Watched this on Amazon Prime, the picture definition is so vivid, it is like they re-made the movie today.\n",
      "I bought National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation because, not only did it make me laugh, it made my mother laugh! This is a movie that should be included in any Christmas movie collection!\n",
      "Our family watches this movie EVERY year. This is the funniest movie for the holidays, many of us can relate to the characters of it. I wish they made movies like this again.\n",
      "With the Christmas season approaching, I thought I'd give my review of Christmas Vacation. While some people are watching It's a Wonderful Life, I'm watching the hilarious antics of Clark W. Griswold.If you've seen the other Vacation movies, you know that poor old Clark W. Griswold brings disaster with him wherever he goes. Although, with this go-round, he stays home this time, trying to throw a \"Good-old-fashioned-family Christmas\". But, of course, there's disaster at every corner. Clark staples himself to a storm gutter putting up Christmas lights, which cause brownouts. A squirrel lives in his Christmas tree. His cousin's doberman brings down the house. Literally. His snooty neighbors won't cut him any slack. He puts an experimental kitchen lubricant on his pan sled.  And, on top of that, his hilariously goofy cousin (Randy Quaid) shows up without warning.The cast is great. Chevy Chase is, as always, histerical, as is Beverly D'Angelo as his smart-aleck wife. Julia-Louis Dreyfus is great as one of Clark's stuck-up neighbors, but the funniest role has to be Randy Quaid as Clark's redneck cousin, Eddie. Quaid was perfect for that role, as well as the rest of Clark's and Ellen's families. I also like the animated Santa intro to the movie, where Santa visits the Griswold residence. If you think you're having a bad holiday, one viewing of this film will quickly change your mind. If you don't laugh at this movie, I will come over to your house and force you to watch this movie several times over. You have to see Christmas Vacation at least once. How could you not laugh at Clark's antics?\n",
      "Here it is, Christmas time again.  In addition to the egg nog and rest of the season, it is time to watch Christmas Vacation for the umpteenth time.  I actually struggled over how many stars to give this film.  Let's face it, the movie is not Casablanca; however, it is just so hilarious in parts, that I can't help but be entertained.  There are some hilarious moments in this film.  These go hand in hand with some of the more inappropriate and gross jokes and sight gags.  There are also a couple of downright poignant moments like when Clark AKA Sparky is up in the attic watching old home movies.  There have been many pretenders; such as the recently awful Deck the Halls, but for the true Holiday comedy classic, you can't go wrong with Christmas Vacation.\n",
      "This is a Christmas movie that brings my family so much fun and laughs at Christmas, we have to see it once or twice each year. It's a Chevy Chase classic for sure.\n",
      "Had to keep the family tradition alive and get the movie on DVD.  DVD is unscratched and plays wonderfully.  If I woke up with my head sewn to the carpet I couldn't be more surprised.\n",
      "Hysterical movie.  Definitely not for small kids, but very enjoyable for teens & adults.  It is my favorite of the National Lampoon's movies.\n",
      "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  This movie has been around for many years and it's still one of our favorite movies.  This movie is especially great at Christmas time when everyone can sit and spend some time together.\n",
      "If you have not seen this movie yet, you need to. This is a classic around the holidays, I probably watch it 12 times.  Have the matching moose mugs, getting ready to throw it back in!\n",
      "a nasty bit of fun.  chevy chase is at his best and all the characters are over the top funny.\n",
      "It has become a Christmas classic. It's one of those movies that you can watch again and again even though you have memorized the best lines of the main characters.\n",
      "I think this movie is one of the best Christmas movies out; along with it's A Wonderful Life. It's what we watch every year.\n",
      "This may be blasphemous, but I think this film ranks right up underneath Monty Python's Holy Grail.  It's just not officially Christmas unless I've watched this film.  I'm NOT a big Chevy Chase fan, but he's perfect in this film.  It's impossible to select my favorite scene - the Squirrel?  The unfortunate cat?  The sled?  The turkey?  The pool fantasy?  \"Bit of a nip in the air?\"  I can't decide.But for me, anyway, my favorite line is easy to pick. Beverly DeAngelo:  \"I don't know what to say, dear, except that it's Christmas -- and we're ALL miserable!\"  (You have to be there, to understand.)Oh! And be sure to take a close look at what Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid are drinking out of when they drink the eggnog -- a little reward for fans of National Lampoon's Family Vacation.Get this movie, and enjoy!\n",
      "What can be said about this movie?  After all Chevy Chase is in it and was a laugh riot. Good suporting cast also.\n",
      "This is my favorite Christmas movie ever. It is continuously funny from start to finish. You can see a person with good intensions screwing up every thing he tries.\n",
      "This is my favorite funny Christmas Movie.  I watch it along with Miracle on 34th Street and Its a wonderful Life every year and of course  we have to include the Santa Clause Movies.\n",
      "Very happy with this product! It's a 'must-watch' every Christmas season! Never gets old or less humorous, and has a lot of heart found in most families.\n",
      "I WISH MORE FUNNY MOVIES WAS LIKE THIS ONE. I LOVE TO SEE MY IN LAW WATCH THIS SO THEY CAN STOP HANGING OUT MY HOUSE\n",
      "This movie is hysterical! Never gets old!!! A true holiday classic and a staple in our house! Chevy chase gives best Oswald performance in this lampoon installment!\n",
      "favorite movie! why do I need to type 18 words when only 2 will do? Five more words. two more words\n",
      "I got the DVD within a few days, very quickly.  We watched it that evening and it was great.  Very funny.\n",
      "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a really funny Christmas movie always love to watch it around this time of year.\n",
      "Great movie,a tradition every year in our family.  Christmas wouldn't be the same with this movie.\n",
      "Hilarious! It's my husbands all time favorite Christmas movie! Love  watching it year after year. Fun for all in the family.\n",
      "Amazing movie!! I watch it multiple times each year and I love that it's a Prime movie now so I don't have to keep up with my DVD\n",
      "This is a classic. We watch this movie every Christmas eve as well as two other. The only reason that I bought the movie in DVD format is that the VHS tape faded on us!!!!\n",
      "I think this is the best of the series and Chevy is in top performance as Clark! Cousin Eddie is just the best cousin anyone would want to have!\n",
      "This is by far the best Christmas movie ever. I watch it several times every Christmas season. I used to have it on VHS but had to get the DVD copy since we no longer have a tape player. Great price on Amazon!\n",
      "I think that this is an absolute must have in a DVD library.  You just have to watch this at Christmas, or any other time of the year.  Just another silly movie that I love.\n",
      "We love this movie at our house it is a yearly classic. Now we have a replica of the Mansion created by North Bay Mercantile it just makes the movie  even more special.\n",
      "Nothing says Christmas quite like the Grizwalds.  I laugh every time I watch this one...from finding the right tree to getting the perfect gift (meow) to the Christmas Catfood jello...\n",
      "i have not watched this movie in a long time so i put it on the roku one night and the family sat. dow and watched it.  chevy chase is great in this movie with his timing for his slap stick comedy. randy quaid is hilarious with his role as cousin eddie. it is non stop laughter. highly recommended!!\n",
      "Thanksgiving marks the first annual viewing of National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation in my family.  It's practically on loop for the remainder of the Christmas season.  Every type of joke is represented here- from slapstick to more subtle.  This movie will make you laugh out loud and leave you with sore cheeks from smiling.\n",
      "this was sent to me via a \"rental\" code and we watched movie together....it was in great quality, loved the chance to  watch with a friend..WILL DO AGAIN!\n",
      "This is the best Christmas movie ever made! Our family looks forward to watching this movie every year. So funny!\n",
      "Everyone loves this. A holiday classic in my family! 11 more words required but I've got nothing else to say.\n",
      "This was a GREAT comedy movie!!! I've seen every Vacation movie there is, and every one is funny in its own way. This one is full of laughs and VERY funny moments.Instead of traveling(like in every other \"Vacation\" movie)The Griswalds are going to invite the whole family over and have a \"Fun-filled old fashioned family Christmas\".. NOT!! Every thing goes wrong... They get tailed by two thugs while driving out of town to get their christmas tree which is taller than their living room ceiling, Clarke puts in money ahead of time for a swimming pool, Clarke(Chevy Chase) puts 2,500 lights on his roof, and so on.Then the realitives arrive, bearing arguments and family fights. And then Cousin Eddy(Randy Quaid)comes and surprises every one and \"shacks up with them.\" I don't want to give the whole movie away(especially the GREAT ending..)so I'll stop there.I own this movie and have watched it over 50 times, and I laugh EVERY time! I highly reccommend buying this movie, it's worth the $....(This is definently better than Chase's Fletch or Funny Farm.)\n",
      "I have seen this movie a few times but it always makes me laugh, I love it!  If you have never seen it....it is well worth watching.\n",
      "I was able to download this with the help of the Amazon software for playing the movie. I can watch it over and over.\n",
      "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is about keeping traditions going. It's about expecting and getting what you've dreamed about all year long. Oh sure, it's got the usual obnoxious relatives visiting for the holidays and all the antics that come with them. And, let's face it, you'll still laugh at the jokes and the sight gags and maybe see yourself in some of them too!  It's one of my favorite holiday movies.\n",
      "Very good movie. Awesomely funny. If you haven't seen this movie, watch it NOW. You will not be disapointed. I watch it every year. :P\n",
      "All time family favorite all year around. So happy to finally own it and watch without commercial! Definitely recommend to everyone\n",
      "I've watched this movie at least twice a year since it came out. The holiday season is never complete until I've watched this movie at least twice. The acting is great and the script is hilarious. This movie is timeless!\n",
      "Warner Bros. has doena great job on transferring an older movie to Blu Ray, the ultimate in HD technology. The video was great considering its age, far better then the DVD version I once owned. For those interested, I watched the film thru my PS3 connected by a HDMI to DVI cord, and thru a Toslink optical audio output to a Pionner 660W 6.1/7.1 receiver on a Hitachi 42\" 1080i plasma. Hopefully, Warner Bros. will make a smart move and become Blu Ray only, ending this drawn out and pointless format war where only the consumers are hurting.\n",
      "Love all the Vacation films.  This one is extra funny because it reminded me of my husband several years ago.\n",
      "Top notch. Not a year goes by that I don't watch this. Funny from start to finish, a feel good movie that plays in heavy rotation in my player around the holidays. Seriously, why even read my review? You should be watching this movie if you are on the fence, if you have never seen it, just do it.\n",
      "This is the best Christmas movie to watch every year.  Very good comedy and takes the stress out of planning all your Christmas shopping and decorating.\n",
      "This is a great movie. I was thrilled that I was able to find it before christmas. All the stores that I went to where sold out and I wanted to get it for a gift for my father. I love shopping at Amazon.com!!\n",
      "This is a classic comedy for the holidays.  We laugh every year when we watch it so I finally decided to buy it.  I only wish it was a little \"cleaner\" for the kids, but there are far worse things on regular TV.  Just some inferences made here.  Otherwise a great show to keep the whole family laughing.\n",
      "It's hilarious, reminds me of Dumb and Dumber. The road rage scene, the giant tree, and the Christmas lights are my favorite parts.\n",
      "No issues with the blu-ray.  I found this to be extremeley competitive pricing for $10.  I've ordered other blu-ray's from amazon recently that have skipped straight out of the package so I'm happy this one doesn't.\n",
      "Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid lead the way in this hilarious holiday edition of Grizwold antics.  Great laughs throughout make this an enjoyable Christmas must-watch!\n",
      "If you have ever seen the movie you get what I mean when I say you will hurt your side laughing!  We watch this every Christmas! Its physical comedy, sight-gags, and the crazy Griswold extended family make this a priceless annual treat!  If you have never seen it--you are in for a real treat!\n",
      "Always a great holiday classic with vintage Chevy Chase. May not be suitable for young viewers, which could view a tv version due to language\n",
      "I'm so glad Warner wised up and re-released this in OAR. It truly is the best Vacation movie and this DVD is miles better than my crappy old pan and scan VHS copy.With a strong John Hughes script, an ace comic performance from Chase and onslaught of jokes and quotable dialogue this is not only best of the \"Vacation\" series but one of THE Xmas movies. There certain movies that Xmas cannot be without (Scrooged, Planes, Trains and Automobiles and Gremlins are the others) and this is one of them. Xmas Vacaction is definitely the new 'It's A Wonderful Life'.This time the Griswolds are staying at home in the snowy suburbs of Chicago and are preparing for the 'best Xmas ever' as Clark has been dreaming of a 'good ol' fashioned family Xmas all his life'. But it's not that simple. The in-laws hate each other, brother and sister are forced to sleep together, there's no Xmas bonus (not a good one anyway) and Hillbilly cousin Eddie (a classic performance from Randy Quaid) imposes in an impromptu 'surprise' visit. It seems like a disaster waiting to happen but there is no waiting; Just disaster, as everything that can go wrong...does. And them some. But the ever-delusional Chase will not let any little mishaps sway his optimism.The suburban-American Xmas atmosphere is captured perfectly and snow covered scenery gives the impression of a very cosy Xmas. Watch this film during advent, I guarantee it will be to your festive benefit.The new DVD has an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 and has a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack. It's definitely one to get for this time of year.\n",
      "If you have never seen this, do yourself a favor and watch it.  It is a classic that is a must see!\n",
      "Love it!!! Ordered this to watch with my family. This is one of my favorite Christmas movies, ordered from Amazon and recieved very quickly.\n",
      "i order this movie  to send to my friend to  HUNGARY.  we have this long time ago.  every x mas i wacthing it,look  the family  cope  with the disaster  .  the movie came before the due  date,very thank full the seller.  they are perfect.  thanks again :  IRENE\n",
      "This video is a favorite traditional Christmas movie for my family.it is funny,bitter sweet and everything works out in the end.\n",
      "How could any one not love this movie . It has been my favorite every year and remains to this day! The best Christmas movie ever!!!!!\n",
      "Clark wants everything to go perfectly but it doesn't. This is a funny movie for the whole family to enjoy. We look forward to watching it each Christmas\n",
      "I have been watching this movie every Christmas Holiday for so many years. i still laugh. Still like Chevy Chase and his humor.\n",
      "Let me just say, that I like this movie for one reason, because it actually tells the truth, Not all of us are happy on the holidays, and we may not be getting a big bonus, or we could be having a very sick cousin, or everyone really does not want to see each other. This is why this film is funny, it doesn't put itself behind a charade and make itself something it's not it shows people what a terrible christmas would be like, and I think people laugh at this because they know that they could never be in these situations, plus most of the situations Chevy Chase and Company get in simply are a hoot. If you want the \"other\" true meaning of christmas get this movie.\n",
      "I have watched it every Xmas season to lower my false expectations that this season has in our country. This is the Xmas from Hell and yet with Chevy stumbling along in Blind Faith in the Universe, it actually turns out.  When he puts on his hockey mask half way thru the movie and takes out his chain saw to get ..... another tree . . . his interaction with his Yuppie neighbor is priceless ( you will recongnize Elaine from Seinfield).  Great cast and comic timing from the opening scene with the kids to the Buster Keaton ending.  At the conclusion, you can only say: Yeah, my Christmas was pretty smooth last year . . . not matter what drama you had felt had ruined your holidays.  What a cast of characters!!!\n",
      "We watch this every year at Christmas time. Dad got a blue ray for his birthday, so we knew this would be a perfect gift for him.\n",
      "This movie is a must for every home around the holidays. I've already watched it this season and I was so happy to have received this movie in the mail. Simply Awesome\n",
      "Since about 1995, christmas at our house jsut wouldnt be the same if we didn't watch \"christmas vacation\" and \"christmas story\" about 80 times between the dvd and when its on tv.  This movie is perfect.  I can't think of a single instance in the film where something could be changed.  Teh best of the vacation movies and one of my all time favorite films, Christmas Vacation shows every family that no matter how bad christmas is at your house it could always be worse. If you like Chevy Chase, in his good days, or any of the other vacation movies then buy this now, don't rent, don't think jsut buy.  Even if its jsut for the sleddign scene this movie is worth 14 bux.  Video quality o nthe dsic is clear and clean, but not mindblowing, it doesn't need to be.  the sound is good, voices are clear, music doesn't drown anyone out. ONce again nothing spectacular but it doesnt need to be.  Extras are slim pickings, but there wouldnt be much to put on here anyways.  Even tho thsi movie will be on tv 3468 times between November 1st and December 25th. It is still worth owning as it can be watched year round.  You won't fee lstoopid watching it at other times in the year.  Christmas in July, anyone?\n",
      "The comedic spin of spending Holidays with a disfunctional family was great!  This is the best of the \"Griswold Series\".\n",
      "Great movie to watch during the holiday season something that every family should enjoy to gather with. Just an all time Classic.\n",
      "I purchased this as a gift for my father. This is his all time favorite Christmas movie and this collectors edition was great. He loved it and I did too. Happy I bought it!\n",
      "great holiday movie, never gets old, family laughs together every time we watch it one of our christmas time favorites!\n",
      "Bought this one cause it's my most favorite christmas movie. Love the special feature section too. Great DVD.Good price to!!\n",
      "This movie shows me a lot of thingsFirst it is about  Making the family happySecond it shows corporate greed.Then the overall what Christmas is really about.  Giving.  Funny  I love this movie just had to have it in its best presentation.  Long live the. Griswolds\n",
      "Behind It's a wonderfull life come's National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation as the best christmas film. It's the funniest christmas film ever and his hard to beat. Fallowing the first 2 vacation films come's this slapstick screw ball film about a family trying to have a fun filled family christmas where everything gose wrong. The christmas eve dinner scene is hallariouse, the squirell part is great, the neighbours are scene stellers and Randy Quide is great and couisn Eddie. The film is the best vacation movie and is a chrismtas trediation tow atch every year.\n",
      "Brings back those childhood memories of Christmas. When life as a kid was magical and you didn't see life as an adult.\n",
      "This is the GREATEST Christmas movie ever made! Definitely worth buying and watching. Whether you get it on dvd or blu-ray it doesn't matter.\n",
      "Fantastic!  I was looking for a movie that would lift my spirits and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation was the right prescription! If you want/need a movie to get you out of an emotional slump, I highly recommend this movie.  It's a classic that never gets old.\n",
      "Man, is this a funny movie.  It has taken the place in our DVD collection along side \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" \"A Christmas Story,\" and \"A Charlie Brown Christmas.\"  It has all the right elements for the season: humor, a good storyline, and a lot of holiday spirt.  And while I'm not a very big fan of Chevy Chase, he's perfect reprising his role as the befuddled Clark Griswold, trying to keep the relative happy during the holidays.I'm not going to be saying anything new that the 200+ people have already said regarding the storyline of this movie, but I will pull out a few favorite scenes:* Randy Quaid as Eddie emptying out his RV's toilet in the street.  Eddie steals every scene he's in.* Clark meeting Eddie's dog Snots for the first time.* The squirrel attack.* Uncle Louis catching on fireThe list can go on and one, but so do the laughs with this movie.  This is simply just a great holiday film that you can watch anytime the mood strikes.  It touches on all that can (and often does) go wrong during the holidays, but it all comes together with a happy ending.  Highly recommended!\n",
      "Just like every National Lampoon movie, this one does not dissapoint. As a matter of fact, I consider this movie to be a classic no doubt about this. this is something that you can enjoy with your family and your loved ones. Chevey Chase was hilarious. Most of the old people there seem to annoy me. Like the guy that burnt down the tree. And that crazy guy from Independence Day that flew the plane into the alien thing was on it too. I forget his name on the movie but he was funny too. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The best part was when Chevey was going crazy because he didnt get his bonus and he started to flip out on everybody. Then the guy kidnapped the boss and brought him to the house. It was pretty funny. The old lady saying the national anthem during grace was also funny. The ending was straight up hilarious. I can't tell you what happened because you need to get it for yourself to see. This is one of those movies that you must add to your collection. A definite \"MUST GET\"~!!\n",
      "Clark and family are so much mopr enjoyable on the new Blue Ray version.  A great edition to our Christmas collection\n",
      "One Xmas movie must every holiday season!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Chevy Chase is funny as hell in this Xmas comedy. Don't forget to watch it next holiday season.\n",
      "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation has become a perennial Christmas classic for its timeless portrayal of a family, brought together to fulfill the oft stated holiday ideal of spending time with family, The movie gains its appeal by so accurately exaggerating (ever so slightly) the dysfunction that comes in assembling so many diverse or even eccentric personalities together over the holiday backdrop in a way that every family can relate to.  Truly, every family has a Cousin Eddie, in-laws who are always critical, parents or grandparents who are supportive yet always did something more or better when they were young.  In essence, the appeal of National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is less as a holiday film than it is a comedically brilliant, albeit an accurate portrayal of how families coexist with one another, all in the name of the \"family\" bond.\n",
      "Saw in first in the theater, and it never gets old.I laugh just as hard now, as I did then.\n",
      "The overall review was a very good movie.  However, the content and type of profanity could have been less.  For adults, very funny but not  for kids.\n",
      "Is there a John Hughes movie out there that doesn't somehow remind us of our own lives?? This movie makes me smile every time I watch it because I can see my own family members in it.\n",
      "Chevy Chase has been in a lot of bad movies, even a couple with \"Vacation\" in the title. This is not one of them. Christmas Vacation may be somewhat dated in places, but it doesn't matter. There are laughs galore of both the low-brow and the more thoughtful kind. It's very funny, and very re-watchable.\n",
      "Great addition to your collection as well as a cheerful christmas movie to watch with loved ones.  Toot toot toot\n",
      "This is the original Christmas Classic of our time! I think everybody can relate to the craziness of the season and of the family members.\n",
      "This is one of the greatest comedy Christmas movies ever. It never gets old to watch this one. I could watch it several time in a row and still watch it the next day. Shows true family spirit whan a bunch of relitives gather for a Christmas meal. Could be 5 plus stars. With the extras that comes with this movie set, it makes it more fun to own.\n",
      "This movie will cheer up any Scrooge as it shows that no matter how bad your holidays might be going, they could always be worse...  Classic Christmas comedy that is a family favorite year after year...\n",
      "My family watches this movie ever year and we never tire of the antics.  It is just a great holiday movie.\n",
      "Very nice to see the movies from my childhood! There should not be a minimum number of words required for this. It is asking too much.\n",
      "Watch it every year around the holidays.  Got sick of renting so I purchased it here for a great price!\n",
      "We wanted to update the picture quality for this yearly classic, and we were not dissapointed: picture quality was as expected from a bluray format.\n",
      "Prime instant movies are great, but they are not clear, and are at times a little blurry. The streaming is not as good as Netflix. Never had that problem with Netflix.  However, I do like prime better, just wish the streaming was better.\n",
      "let's all remember to keep Christ in Christmas\n",
      "I have watched this movie every year since it first came out.  It is the ultimate beginning to the Holiday season.It is my absolute favorite Christmas movie!\n",
      "This is such a classic movie!  I could watch this movie anytime of the year.  The best ever!!!  Watch it, you will laugh throughout the entire movie.  I would highly recommend this movie!\n",
      "This movie is a classic and the Christmas season is not complete until I have seen this movie each year. As many times as I have seen it, it still makes me laugh out loud!\n",
      "By now almost everyone who is anybody here in the United States has seen this film. It is a classic that I enjoy watching on other days not only the Christmas season. Fully of laughs that everyone will enjoy. You would have to not like comedies to dislike this one.\n",
      "Glad to get a copy of this.  It's a must see every Christmas.  Giving it to my kids to watch.\n",
      "very goodhate writing reviews. makes me not want to order . have i reached 18 words yet  only 2 left  DONE!\n",
      "Crazy, fun movie to share with family during the holidays.  Not exactly like my family, but everyone can relate to some part of this film!\n",
      "Chevy's movies are always funny and I enjoy this at Christmas which is a great family movie. Good to always have on hand!\n",
      "It is so funny. This Chevy is at his best. The wadded ball of lights reminds me of my childhood!\n",
      "This is a classic Christmas movie to watch with your family around the holidays. It does have some language in it that isn't for  little children.\n",
      "There is a reason why so many people say that National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is at the top of their list of Christmas comedies. First of all, it is hilarious -- totally, truly hilarious! Without a doubt, it is the best of all the National Lampoon Vacation movies of all time, and that is saying a lot. It moves from one classic scene to another. By the time you've all stopped howling at one scene, you are laughing at the next. You may find yourself having to rewind because you miss so much.If you already own National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, order copies for friends. It's the absolutely perfect gift for comedy lovers, guaranteed!\n",
      "This is such a great movie. I love it. I MUST BUY THIS DvD!!!!!Get the others too. SNAP!bye..\n",
      "One of the greatest Christmas movies of my generation and maybe the best Lampoon's vacation movie. Just finished a theater room and was a must have on Blu-Ray.\n",
      "This movie officially marks the beginning of Christmas and it's just as good as the first time I watched it.\n",
      "My friends and I love this movie. It's a  holiday classic in our household.  I just introduced it to my daughter this year :)\n",
      "I have to watch this every year as it is a Christmas Classic.  I think the best part about the movie is almost everyone can relate to some aspect of the movie.\n",
      "This movie has always been one of my personal favorites. It's a hilarious movie that's great for the family and leaves you wondering, \"What else can go wrong?\"\n",
      "Many thoughts come to mind when I think of Christmas... Family, Friends, Presents and so on. The first thing I usually think about when I hear Christmas? National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. Some may think A Christmas story, Elf, Miracle on 34th Street among others. None of those touch Christmas Vacation. This movie screams Christmas to me! I absolutely love this movie. There have been years where I have lived this movie. This gift set is the ultimate gift for that person who loves this movie. It comes with a blu-ray edition of the movie. Much better picture but the same features as the DVD.It comes with a packet of instant snow which I am sureI will never open or use. Next is the coasters. Various character coasters that have quotes from the movie are nice and good quality. You have a santa hat with a marty moose emblem on it which is nice quality. You have a I survived a Griswold family christmas which is great I wore it this year with pride haha. You also get a marty moose mug but its a mini replica and can't be used. My only gripe about the whole set I wish it was full size and useable. All in all its a great Christmas movie that you can watch over and over and the gifts you get with this collectors edition is well worth the extra money. Definately buy this and enjoy every Christmas!!\n",
      "Yet another in the great Vacation series. The Griswolds have the whole family over for what most would perceive to be the \"A-typical\" Griswold family Christmas. This is a must have for the Christmas season.\n",
      "This, along with The Ref, are two movies I watch every Christmas. They still crack me up every time. Gotta love Chevy!\n",
      "Must Watch!!!! One of the great ones to see at Christmas time. You will love it. A break from the real world.\n",
      "There are a few classic Christmas movies that we must include in our holiday itinerary and this is one of them.  Chevy Chase was in is heyday and his unique humor is contagious and non-stop.  The cast of characters supports the wacky theme and guarantees great belly laughs from the whole family.  I have viewed it, many times and look forward to next year.  If you haven't seen it you must give it a try.\n",
      "I make sure that I watch National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation at least once during the holidays. It really has it all. It is one of those films that will never get old no matter how many times you've seen it. I mean how could the sight of cousin Eddie in his bathrobe emptying sewage from his mobile home on a nice winters morning get old? If you haven't seen this one yet I would strongly recommend picking it up. The whole family will love it.\n",
      "National Lampoon should prepare you for what you should expect. Some people love It's a Wonderful Life. Some people love A Christmas Story. I love them both and have added National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation as one of my must watch holiday classic movies.\n",
      "The last true family man. That is how Clark Griswald is described by his fellow co-worker reguarding using his Christmas bonus to put in an in-ground pool for his family. Needing to place a $7500 deposit to ensure the pool gets put in at the right time the ground is thawing, Clark overextends himself, not having the money in his bank accout to cover the check he wrote, he needs this bonus more than ever. each day the bonus doesn't show up in the mail, Clark's good ol' family fun filled Christmas cheer is being drained.. quickly.. with the help of his family. As having your own parents stay with you during the holidays isn't hard enough, he's forced to share his holiday with his wine guzzling, chain smoking mother in law, uptight father in law, Aunt Bethany who wraps things from around her house to give as presents, not excluding living things, Uncle Lewis whom I thought for the longest time was Maury Povitch. But nothing compares to what rolls in, complete with home to invade and shamelessly impose on this Christmas, Cousin Eddie (played by the hilarious Randy Quaid) and his family. Between squirrels stowing away in the Christmas tree, Juliette Lewis' (Audrey) eye balls being frozen, and Chevy Chase punching a plastic Santa in it's face, it's the little things in this movie that make it an all time classic. I would even watch this if it weren't Christmas time. This is the last of the great 80's comedies.\n",
      "This is by far one of my favorite holiday classics. With a cast of memorable characters and quotes you will keep referencing, its a guaranteed multiple viewing.\n",
      "One of the funniest movies of all time.  This is a annual event in my house.  Sure it's on TV, but having the DVD is so much better.\n",
      "A yearly tradition providing counterpoint to the other go to Christmas movies like It's a Wonderful Life and The Christmas Story.\n",
      "Christmas Vacation is the funniest of all three of the Vacation films. The reason is simple: lots of Clark and tons of Cousin Eddie. These two together are the funniest thing going. The dialogue is hilarious:Clark: Can I get you somemore eggnog? Drive you out to the middle of nowhere, leave you for dead?Eddie: No, I'm just fine Clark.OREddie: You surprised Clark?Clark: Surprised, if I woke up tomorrow with my head sewn to the carpet I wouldn't be as surprised as I am now.OREddie: I can't swim, Clark.Clark: I know that Eddie.ORClark: Where's Eddie? He usually eats these G-d damn things?Catherine: Oh not anymore, he found out that squirrel is high in cholesterol.Randy Quaid will never play a better character and aside from Fletch, this is what Chevy Chase's legacy will be. Also the periphery characters are hilarious. Aunt Bethany (Is Rusty Still in the Navy? or Don't throw me down Clark or Is your house on fire, Clark?), Uncle Louis (So what's the matter with you?), Clark's parents (SQUIRREL!!!!!!!!), Ellen's Parents (The little lights aren't twinkling...), and Clark's kids (who are different ages in every film).Christmas Vacation is a true holiday classic for the rest of us who don't lead picture perfect lives and don't pull off every holiday without a glitch. Buy it and cherish it. Highly Recommended.\n",
      "This was one of the best series on tv in the 80,s and it was only on tv for two seasons.  I have been having a ball watching and reliving that period of the 60's that it relates too.  Best of the best as far as I am concerned.  I only wish that the quality of the series was prevalent in today's tv.  About the only thing to compare is, of course, Law and Order.  I would recommend this two season series to everyone.  Dennis Farina was superb.  I really love it.\n",
      "A great classic with some of my favorite lines. The best of the vacation series. Irrevrant, funny review of realistic family life.\n",
      "I Love this DVD and have for years. It  just get scratched from my son. If you have never seen it , you must !!!\n",
      "\"We're going to have the hap-hap-happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tapdanced with Danny *** Kaye!!\"I loved this movie!! In-laws from Hell (would you want to have Randy Quaid as your cousin???) at your home. (Think \"12 Pains of Christmas.\") Dealing with a burnt-up Christmas tree from an uncle who tosses his match after lighting his \"stogie.\" A very well-done turkey! And Jell-O with cat food for the topping!!Every time the holiday hassles start getting to me, I pop this in and crack up every time! A good way to get the holiday spirit in gear!\n",
      "Laughter from beginning to end... I laughed out loud practically thru this whole thing. I think just about anyone can find something in this movie they can relate to. If you like the \"Vacation\" movies with the Griswold clan...you'll love this one! Enjoy!\n",
      "Favorite movie ever.  Makes me laugh time after time.  Love to watch it around the holidays especially when I am having a hard time getting into the holiday spirit.\n",
      "is it really worth the time to review this movie.  its a classic and if you have not seen it, go ahead and order two copies, one for you and one for your mother.\n",
      "Watch it every year with my Family and Friends..Highly recommended for laughter and stress relief during the Holiday season...Try it!!!\n",
      "The perfect dysfunctional Christmas holiday movie. Wonderful lines, reactions, characters and story. Fun times are at home. It is more of a tradition than A Christmas Carol or Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer ever was. Gut-wrenching humor. Chevy Chase plays the perfect Griswold sap and Randy Quaid as the adorable dufus, Cousin Eddie.\n",
      "I've seen this movie at least twice a year every year since it came out! It is a classic that will always get a laugh out of me each Christmas! If you haven't seen it do us all a favorite and rent it right now\n",
      "Well, perhaps it's tied for first place with The Christmas Story, just can't resist Ralphie's appeal. ; )I watch this movie at least once if not twice in the run-up to Christmas.  Gosh, all the actors look so young, makes me feel young too!  lol\n",
      "christmas vacation is a classic. Older teens loved it. Keep for later with the younger set. really enjoyed it. Thanks\n",
      "I would recommend this Movie to family's with kids over the age of 13 because there are some scenes that I feel aren't appropriate for the younger group.\n",
      "For children, the approach of Christmas is a time of breathless anticipation.  For many adults, it is a feeling of slow strangulation.  There is no question that this is an adult Christmas film, best watched after everyone under about age 14 is tucked safely into bed for their long winter's nap.Don't fill your eggnog glasses too full, however; because fifteen minutes into \"Christmas Vacation\" you'll be laughing so hard that you'll be wearing your Old English and J&B; on your reindeer sweater.  Quite simply, this movie is the most side-splittingly funny film ever made about the American tradition of all getting together in one house for Christmas and driving each other nuts.Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) is the focal point of the hilarity, caught as he is in a futile struggle to live up to his own impossible expectations about himself and his role as his extended family's new patriarch and benevolent provider.  The three sets of elderly grandparents who detest each other all add to his feeling of tension and pressure; and the uninvited appearance of cousin Eddy, his family and his snot-soaked dog in a moldering, ancient RV is the final jewel in this crown of comedic genius.Add to this equation the whining teenage daughter, the ever-patient and eternally suffering son, the boss who doesn't even know his name, the Christmas bonus check that still hasn't arrived, and the 25,000 \"Imported Italian Twinkle Lights\" that simply refuse to light, (or twinkle,) and you have in Clark a man who is standing, as he howls at one point, \"on the brink of Hell.\"Throughout it all, the exquisite and irreplaceable Beverly D'Angelo breezes around as Clark's beautiful and inhumanly loving and patient wife; proving conclusively that even being married to the perfect woman isn't enough to make a man happy when he expects the superhuman from himself.With these ingredients and these actors alone, we have a potentially good, funny, interesting film.  There is, however, a third element that pushes this movie over the top and into the realm of true, timeless greatness; and that is the sheer love it has for the often burdensome cross of family.I challenge you to watch this and not tear up at some point.  When Clark finds old 8mm film of his childhood Christmases in the '50's; when his father comes out to the laundry room to give him a loving word of advice; when the godd**n lights FINALLY come on.  These are just a few of the moments where I pretend my nose is stuffed up, and keep my face turned so that my tears are invisible.  This film genuinely loves Clark and his all-too-familiar family; and even though each heartwrenching moment is likely to be followed by an exquisite gag that will have you crying and choking at the same time, I challenge you not to love yourself and everyone around you (even your relatives) just a little bit more after watching this classic.Merry Christmas.\n",
      "Great holiday laugh!  Classic.  This is the best National Lampoons Vacation movie of all time. You can watch this over and over and continue to laugh.\n",
      "What great service received in 2 days and in perfect shape! Would not hesitate to use them again. And the movie is great!\n",
      "My family has watched this movie every Christmas eve many years and on several media formats.  Now I have it on my Kindle.  We will likely watch it this Thanksgiving as we travel.\n",

      "This was well packaged and of great quality! Great gift package and well worth the cost. Great experience and a solid gift idea.\n",
      "This movie is a classic. Hilarious from the beginning to the end. If you have never seen it, you are truly missing out on one of the funniest movies of all time!\n",
      "It made me laugh when I needed to. The incident with the tree being too big hits close to home. Funny how it didn't look that big when I cut it down.\n",
      "this is the best one of the Vacation flicks, a Christmas classic, this is so funny, it will make your sides hurt from laughing so much\n",
      "You really take your life in your hands every time you sit down with a Chevy Chase film. Let's face reality here: Chevy Chase is responsible for several of the worst movies ever made. Does it take more than a few minutes of viewing to see the mind numbing folly of \"Nothing But Trouble,\" \"The Three Amigos,\" and \"Spies Like Us\"? Chase has sure had his truly embarrassing moments on the big screen. What redeems the guy, at least in my eyes, are several films that play up to the comedian's smart alecky, deadpan delivery. \"Fletch,\" of course, is the gold standard of Chevy Chase films, but other movies showcase his talents just as well. I always thought \"Deal of the Century\" a classic Chase film, as well as \"Foul Play\" (although the latter was more of an ensemble picture). But we need look no further than the four National Lampoon Vacation films to truly judge the merits of this comedian turned actor. Actually, I should say three Vacation films since the second installment, where the Griswold family went on a tour of Europe, ranks as one of the most dreadful stories ever put on film. Of the three successful entries, \"Christmas Vacation\" is the best, perhaps even eclipsing the first movie that started it all.You won't hear the familiar strains of Lindsey Buckingham's \"Holiday Road\" in \"Christmas Vacation,\" and there are no corpses strapped to the top of a station wagon either. Instead, the film invites us into the Griswold home for an old fashioned Christmas celebration the likes of which soon reach catastrophic levels. Clark (Chevy Chase) and Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) Griswold, along with their disinterested kids Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and Russ (Johnny Galecki), invite the whole family over for a season filled with happiness. Clark's parents Clark Sr. (John Randolph) and Nora (Diane Ladd) show up, as does Ellen's folks Art (E.G. Marshall) and Frances (Doris Roberts). And yes, even Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) makes an appearance to save the day. Of course, along with the family comes the inevitable frustrations and stresses everyone who has ever dealt with a reunion dreads. Clark Griswold refuses, at least initially, to fall into a morass of cynicism and despair amidst the bickering and insults. His invention of a new milk preservative has our hero hoping his Christmas bonus will be extra big this year, big enough so he can install an in ground swimming pool in the backyard. Unfortunately, his boss Frank Shirley (Brian Doyle-Murray) is a scrooge with plans to make the company more fiscally conservative.While he waits for the check to arrive at the house, Clark embarks on several hilarious projects that haul in the belly laughs. His attempts to cover every square inch of his house with Christmas lights is a chore requiring several falls off a ladder, pointed verbal repartees with his snotty neighbors Margo and Todd Chester (Julia-Louis Dreyfus and Nicholas Guest), and repeated failures to get the strands to light up. The acquisition and installment of the Griswold family Christmas tree is another chore handled in Clark's inimitable style. Imagine the pine they string up in Rockefeller Square every year, subtract roughly five feet from its height, and you have the tree Clark insists on setting up in the house. This thing is so huge that the branches knock out the windows when Griswold cuts the rope holding the branches together. No Yuletide season, however, would be complete without a trip to the slopes for a sledding excursion, an event filled with disastrous implications when Griswold comes up with the bright idea to cover the bottom of his sled with a Teflon based substance. My favorite scenario involves Clark trapped in his attic for a few hours. He spends his time dressed up in women's clothing (to stay warm) watching old home movies of his childhood. His abrupt fall through the trap door had me laughing for hours afterwards.The cast of \"Christmas Vacation\" gels fantastically, far better than any cast in the other three films. Kudos as always go to Randy Quaid as the squirrelly moocher Eddie; a film in this series just wouldn't be the same without this character driving Clark to fits of distraction. Beverly D'Angelo is one of those actresses who get hotter and hotter with age. The linchpin of the film is, as always, Chevy Chase as the disaster prone Clark Griswold. This is a role tailor made for his brand of clumsy, caustic humor. I don't know about you, but Chase's depiction reminds me in many ways of my own father--he won't listen to the advice of anyone else, his ideas are the best ideas, he tosses safety to the wind when working on dangerous projects, etc. But like my Dad--and probably countless other fathers--Clark is sincere and wants his loved ones to have wonderful family memories. The film works so well, I suspect, because most of us instantly recognize his character traits in our own beloved family patriarchs. Especially when Clark can't stand the pressure anymore and launches into one of his over the top tirades, again a trademark of our own fed up fathers.Although the DVD carries the \"Special Edition\" tag, the extras are surprisingly sparse. A trailer and a commentary constitute the sum total of goodies available on the disc. Moreover, the commentary doesn't include Chevy Chase. At least you hear Randy Quaid, Beverly D'Angelo, Johnny Galecki, Miriam Flynn (Eddie's wife Catherine), director Jeremiah Chechik, and producer Marty Simmons, but why no Clark W. Griswold? Perhaps he wanted too much money. His absence is unfortunate and mars what is otherwise a great commentary track. I don't even wait until Christmas to watch this movie; it's fun works year round. If you haven't seen it yet, you ought to immediately. You'll love it.\n",
      "This item arrived at the post office at least a full 8 days later than the \"estimated delivery date\".  I am not happy with amazon using USPS for almost 100% of the shipments to me (many purchases!) this holiday season, and it caused  numerous delays-- in receiving packages, in packages getting returned to seller by USPS without my authorization, lack of refunds for those items returned (and still no word on where the heck a number of those packages are, I may add!), and huge inconveniences for me to find the times to pick up all the packages at the post office.  This item should have come before Christmas, based on nearly every single interaction I've ever had with amazon, but it instead arrived nearly ONE WHOLE MONTH after I ordered it. That is NOT ACCEPTABLE.  I am quite disappointed.The movie is funny...haven't opened it up to watch it yet since I've seen it many times, so I can't comment on the playability of this actual dvd I received.  It was supposed to be gift for someone but I had to buy something different instead due to amazon's shipping choices.  Amazon is quickly losing its popularlity in my house.  It's even contributing to my lack of enthusiasm regarding opening and testing the product.  I'm over it....over amazon, for sure, after my many negative experiences during the 2012 holiday shopping season.  :(\n",
      "If your family is anything like this (and I swear my grandpa WAS Clark with the lights), then this is a must for the holidays!\n",
      "I love this movie! Me and my husband pretty much have it memorized, it is SO FUNNY!!! The scenes with the neighbors and with cousin Eddie are classic!\n",
      "This is my favorite funny Christmas movie, has me laughing from beginning to end!!!  Do yourself a favor and watch it.\n",
      "This addition is excellent!  If you have been watching it on tv for years, you'll really appreciate having the full, un-cut version.The clarity of the props in all the scenes is a real treat.If you, or someone you love,  loves National lampoon's Christmas Vacation, buy this.  You will not be disappointed:)\n",
      "Had a great time with the family. we were entertained by watching this movie as a family and it was the first time my parents had seen the movie.\n",
      "You watch it once then twice then you just know you well watch it again.  This is one my most loved movies its funny, and makes you glad your Christmas is not anything like the movie.  Even the music is great and funny. Chevy Chase out performs himself in this one with a cast of wonderful people to add to the plot.  A must watch.\n",
      "One of my favorite xmas movies. Arrived 3 weeks before scheduled ETA and was a brand new movie in orginal packaging. I plan on keeping this around for years to come!  Great price too!\n",
      "I've watched this movie every year since I was a child, and I will continue that tradition as an adult. It is so down to earth and hilarious!\n",
      "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is my favorite movie!  I have loved this since the day I saw it.  My family now has a Thanksgiving tradition of watching this in the evening.  I have watched the movie so many times I can recite almost all of the dialouge and I laugh before something funny even happens. It is the best Christmas movie/comedy ever made.  Fun and laughter for the whole family.\n",
      "Classic movie that never disappoints.  This is a staple around our house for the entire month of December.  Oh, the lines from the movie that we quote all year long!\n",
      "My boyfriend loved it!  It is his all time favorite christmas movie so it made a great gift!!!!! No more words for this movie\n",
      "This movie is a classic Christmas movie.  We have to watch it atleast once a year.  Great for the whole family.\n",
      "This film marks the return of the famous slap-stick comedy of the Griswold's.  The film takes place during the Christmas holiday season and revolves around the antics of Clark Griswold, played by Chevy Chase and his endeavor to provide his family the \"perfect\" Christmas.  Everyone can relate to the colorful array of characters and the experience of spending the holiday season with relatives.  Randy Quaid, brings to life the character of Eddie, who is Clark's unemployed, mooching cousin and will make anyone appreciate their own unique relative.  The script written by the ever popular, John Hughes, is priceless in its content of tasteless humor.This film deserves a four out of five stars rating.  If it isn't already a part of your family's holiday tradition it's worth considering adopting.\n",
      "Love Chevy Chase! Funny Funny movie! I don't have anything else to say about this movie except watch it! You will love it!\n",
      "Christmas isn't complete without at least a half dozen viewings of this movie. The blu-ray quality is excellent and was a great replacement for my old low quality dvd version. Well worth it.\n",
      "This is the new classic christmas movie, and it always makes my entire family laugh.  We wore out the VHS tape we had of it, from it's original release, so this was just to replace the VHS tape with a newer format.  Anyone who has ever seen this movie will love it from the get-go!\n",
      "This movie is so funny.  Anytime it's on TV (which around Christmas, it's like every night) it's a must see.  Even when it's not Christmas time, it's worth a watch!\n",
      "It isn't truly Christmas until I see this, I have to watch it each and every year.  A true classic!\n",
      "Timeless....great movie\n",
      "If you want to have some good laughs no matter your mood, recommend you what this even if you have seen it one or more times before.\n",
      "This made it very convient for us to schedule the families over since we watch it every year near Christmas eve.\n",
      "A Christmas classic must-have! I have always seen this movie on regular TV, so to see it on DVD with the original 'language' was fabulous!\n",
      "I still remember my family heading to the movie theater to watch this when it first came out, I don't think I've every laughed that hard during a movie.This has since become a family tradition ever Christmas. The Bluray looks awesome.\n",
      "Chevy Chase is an incredibly hilarious actor and his National Lampoon movies are by far some of the funniest things I could ever watch. My favorite one of all time is of course Christmas Vacation. I highly  recommend that if you are ready to be in the Christmas spirit, that you buy  this movie to add to your collection. It's what I like to call...a classic.\n",
      "i dont know why i dont actually own this movie because its classic and something i think most people can relate to when it comes to the craziness part of a family christmas. hilarious and heartwarming\n",
      "I typically despise all Christmas movies because I'm not much of a Christmas person.  This is one of my all time favorite movies.  It shows the absurdities of the things we do each season with the hope that there will be happiness among the family.  Great performance from the whole cast.\n",
      "Everyone should see this movie! It makes you laugh but has a good moral also. Chevy Chase is hilarious. Classic in our family.\n",
      "Best Christmas movie ever! A bit of everyone's family members are in this movie. We watch as a family each year while decorating the xmas tree. We all look forward to it.\n",
      "I was and am Very happy with product received. It Was exactly what I had expected. Great service. Awesome product.\n",
      "I love this movie and this is a great edition. Have to watch it every year and makes a great gift\n",
      "There isn't much to say about this movie that hasn't been said, so I won't say anything. Everyone knows how great it is anyway.But what I don't understand is what is everyone's big problem with it not being available in widescreen? I don't get it. Someone please explain. Why is widescreen so special? For me when the movie I want is available in Full-Screen and Widescreen I definately pick the full screen one. Well some things I guess I'll never understand.\n",
      "I can't think of a single thing I DO NOT like about this movie-can you?Ok, one thing...if you don't own it and you get to see it on TV it is edited. It just isn't the same thing when it is edited.and I did not even realize that when I ordered it I would also be able to watch it on my amazon account from anywhere at NO extra cost!!!!This movie is a classic, if you don't own it or have never seen it...it is NOT a risk to watch..unless you don't have a sense of humor...:)\n",
      "This is a good movie to add to yoir collection. A holiday classic. If you haven't seen this yet, you must! You will not be disappointed!\n",
      "There is a sappy irreverence about this Christmas movie.  Sometimes it goes as far to the edge of what will be accepted but at it's core it's about a family that tries real hard to do all the holiday traditions.  Chevy Chase is the hapless dad who would be a nightmare to live next door to at Christmas (probably at Halloween, too)!  The pathetic relatives who come to visit are caricatures to be sure but that's what one expects with a National Lampoon movie isn't it?  So, check your objectivity at the door and just enjoy it.  You will either really hate it or think it's funny!\n",
      "A true classic. Still makes me laugh from the beginning to the end.The quality of the streaming (SD) was very good\n",
      "This DVD is wonderful!  This past weekend, my husband and I  watched it, and even though we had seen it before on television, seeing it unedited brought on even more gales of laughter.\n",
      "I always watch this movie when it's on during the holidays, but now I can watch it when I want, making this one a family holiday movie night tradition.\n",
      "Great movie ... It is rated pg-13 for a reason, though - not appropriate for younger children.  Very funny for a mature audience!\n",
      "One of the best movies of all time.  Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid make a timeless Christmas Classic.\n",
      "Need I say anything about this classic movie?  This is my third copy of it!  It's a great gift idea!\n",
      "Classic and still funny every time i watch it. Chevy Chase at the hight of his comedic genius. I can't imagine that anyone hasen't seen this movie, but if you haven't you should watch it ASAP!!!\n",
      "A Christmas classic. What more do I need to say? Should be in every collection and watched every single year.\n",
      "A timeless classic! - Fun for the whole family. One of cousin Eddie's best roles of all times. Merry Christmas from the Griswalds....\n",
      "Along with the original vacation this is the best of the Chevy Chase 'Vacation' movies.  It's a Christmas watching tradition at my house.\n",
      "We watch it every year as part of our Holiday tradition. We even have the moose glasses to go with it!\n",
      "Proving that's it has appeal for all ages. My kids caught this on PRIME for free, having heard it was the quintessential Christmas movie - at least for their generation. Came away not disappointed, which I'd say means it has aged well and remains relevant. Very good - now I have to go through the Christmas catalog with them.\n",
      "Classic! Gotta love this movie. Something every family should experience together. I would recommend it over and over again! Yay\n",
      "This is the the funniest movie to watch around christmas time. I would not watch it with younger childeren though because of the language but it is a very funny movie. The best parts are when Clark goes crazy cause the lights wont come on and starts to kick the lawn ornaments. Then you got the squirrel which is way too funny and you cant forget about good ol aunt bethany. So overall if you want a hilarious christmas movie get this if you want a funny family movie get christmas story\n",
      "Love the story and the music , can't see the lines Russ, nope Dad.And I wouldn't be more surprised if I work up with my head sown to the carpet.\n",
      "AWSOME MOVIE, JUST A CLASSIC, THAT WILL NEVER BE MADE AGAIN. YOU WILL NEVER SEE THE CURRENT CROP OF PRODUCERS EVER TOUCH THE LINES IN THIS MOVIE.\n",
      "We watch this every Christmas and I still laugh.  The acting is great by many good actors and the plot is timeless.  Only thing is, being a Christmas movie, it had a bit too much language I didn't appreciate.  Otherwise it was very fun and went from one crisis to another.\n",
      "This movie never gets old.  We watched it as a family on Christmas Eve and everybody was laughing at some point in the movie.\n",
      "This movie is a classic.  I can practically recite it from memory.  If someone tells me that they don't like this movie, I seriously contemplate whether the person is worth knowing.  How could you not like this movie?  So many memorable scenes.\n",
      "It's not the slapstick pranks, like falling off of the roof while hanging Christmas lights that make this movie (although they're funny); it's the subtle jokes, like Cousin Eddie wearing a black dickey under a white V-neck sweater.  It's these jokes that make National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation not only a pleasure to watch once, but one to watch every Christmas season.  So, if you appreciate a good laugh with a smattering of good will, make Christmas Vacation part of your family tradition.The movie opens with a car-ride sing-a-long while heading into the backcountry to harvest the family Christmas tree.  Mom and Dad sing enthusiastically while the children roll their eyes.  It's the relatable experiences like this one paired with the far-fetched antics of the Griswold family that make this National Lampoon's installment a success.  After marching in waste-high snow for hours, Clark finds their glorious tree only to realize that he has forgotten a saw. Gaffes like this cause Clark's ideal holiday to fall apart.The progressively deeper dong of the family door bell announces the arrival of the extended family- Clark's parents and in-laws.  Their bickering is heard even before the door is opened and stories of bunions and boils spill over into the Griswold household.  Each of these characters adds a little more chaos and humor, but none as much as the surprise guest- Cousin Eddie.Eddie and his rag-tag family pull up in what Clark describes as a \"tenement of wheels.\"  Eddie and his RV are a source of some of the best laughs in this film: whether it's Eddie's black dickie worn under a white v-neck sweater or his need to empty the RV's septic tank into the street sewer.  My favorite line from Eddie is when he informs Clark that he can't go sledding because the government had to change the metal plate in his head to a plastic one because every time his wife fired up the microwave, he'd `collapse, wet himself, and forget who he was.'After a visit to the local sledding hill, we follow the Clark as he does last minute Christmas shopping, finishes affixing 150,000 light bulbs to his roof, prepares Christmas dinner, and reads The Night Before Christmas.  All events most Christians can relate to.  Of course, none of these go quite as planned, but that's what creates the humor.Underlying all of the hilarity are some serious themes- Eddie is impoverished and can't buy his kids gifts, Clark has put a deposit down on a swimming pool banking on a Christmas bonus that never comes, and the family seems ready to fall apart.  Maybe the Griswolds aren't so fictitious after all.  These moments don't detract from the humor though.  They simply add that special Christmas spirit and good will we look for at this time of year.So, if you're looking for a movie the whole family can enjoy while running here and there during the hectic Christmas season, try National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  You won't be disappointed.\n",
      "this is still one of the best movies ever, and now it's in awesome hi-def. this is a must buy, if you want one of the funniest christmas movies ever.\n",
      "The late producer John Hughes has provided us with yet another great Christmas comedy classic!  Christmas Vacation has been one of my favorite movies for over 20 years, and each time I watch it, I laugh even harder!  Wonderful movie for the holidays or any time of the year.\n",
      "Its Christmas time again for the old Griswold family.Chevy Chase who play Clark W. Griswold, is at it again but this time he trying to give his family and relatives the best Christmas ever.But like in all of the \"vacation\" movies, you have to expect stuff to go wrong.In this one, he cant get the Christmas lights on, his annoying relatives wont leave him alone, he doesnt get the  christmas bonus he was hoping for ,and worst of all(for him), good old cousin Eddie and the gang make another random appearance.This is one of my favorite Christmas movies that is great for the holidays and for a few chuckles.-Watch for the scene where Clark goes sledding,its by far the funniest part of the movie.\n",
      "The dry, subtle humor is great.  The cast works well together.  This movie is for every family who has that \"one over the top\" relative at holidays and family gatherings.\n",

      "The movie is almost an entire video of laughter.  Even though it was filmed about 30 years it's still a good movie.\n",
      "Hilarious, timeless humor.  I love this movie and my family watches it every Christmas.  I enjoy this movie at any time of the year.\n",
      "I love this movie. There are so many scenes that remind me of when my relatives use to visit when I was a kid. The hillbilly relatives, the snooty inlaws, the uninvited guest pets, and most of all, the bickering. This movie is a little to the extreme but not by much. This is what Christmas means to me. It's too bad they don't make more movies like this. It'll always be a favorite in my collection.\n",
      "I saw this movie for the first time about 5 years ago, and tried to catch it yearly around the holidays on regular TV, now I have my own copy and love it.so funny!\n",
      "This movie is so funny and it makes me laugh more each time I see it.  I now have a tradition every Christmas to see this movie.  I never get tired of seeing it every year and look forward to it.  Chevy Chase has always been one of my favorite movie stars.\n",
      "It's a classic, had it on VHS, needed the blu ray version, Love it! Excellent Christmas gift for my husband .\n",
      "This is my all time favorite Christmas movie. Everyone has had a Sparky in their family and holidays that just don't go the way you plan.  The true meaning of Christmas is there all along. It is about family and spending time with them.\n",
      "This movie is part of our Christmas traditions.  After we put the Christmas lights up outside, we come in and watch National Lampoons Christmas Vacation.  It helps us laugh at all the challenges we had when putting up our own lights.  Great stuffQ!\n",
      "Can't survive a Christmas season without at least one viewing of this movie. The guys love it, have to admit it took a while but it has grown on me!\n",
      "Christmas is not Christmas without National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. It is, by far, the BEST and most HILARIOUS Christmas movie EVER! \"Merry Christmas, Clark. Sh*tter's full.\"\n",
      "This movie is an annual tradition around Christmas. It makes us laugh more and more each year!  Chevy Chase is brilliant as always!\n",
      "Third in series of movies about the Griswold family.  This one is about their Christmas vacation. Clark Griswold, the father, is planning on giving his family the best Christmas vacation ever.  Only, one problem, Clark's family is coming!  From the exploding sewer system to the wrapped up cat you'll be rolling on the floor and grabbing your aching sides while watching as what was supposed to be the greatest Christmas in Griswold Family history turns into total and utter disaster!\n",
      "This is the gold star of all Christmas Comedies. There are so many quotable moments in this movie! I watch this 3 -4 times each holiday season. A Classic!\n",
      "Great classic movie.  It has its moments. Brings back lots of memories from childhood watching this holiday movie.  Chevy Chase should do another Vacation movie.\n",
      "My family absolutely loves this movie. We wait all year to watch it around Christmas. The quotes, outfits, and overall sarcastic tones make it a hilarious movie. Classic Christmas movie on Blu-Ray for $10, everyone should own it.\n",
      "This is one movie you'll enjoy more than once.  If there's a funnier movie about Xmas,I don't know about it.\n",
      "Best movie ever (a little dramatic) holiday or other wise. I have watched a 1000 times and laugh every time.\n",
      "This classic is my all time favorite...period. Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) wants nothing more than a good, old-fashioned family Christmas but the dream becomes a nightmare when nothing goes right in his plan. Enjoy it with your family but be warned that there is some language that may not be suitable for the young ones. HILARIOUS!\n",
      "Christmas Vacation is our families favorite Christmas movie.  It usually gets viewed several times during the holidays and occasionally during the rest of the year.  Love the Griswalds.\n",
      "This movie is a classic and looks fantastic in HD! I would highly recommend to anybody wanting a watch a holiday movie with adult comedy!\n",
      "If you see it, you'll understand.  Definitely one ,of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  Randy Quade steals the show.\n",
      "Right up there at the top of the list for holiday movies. A christmas classic. We watch this Thanksgiving night every year. Can't miss.\n",
      "one day the ending will change but it gets better every year. truly a Christmas classic for the family to enjoy.\n",
      "Chevy Chase takes on Christmas at home with a host of family members and just to top it off, cousin Eddy(Randy Quaid) shows up to put a top on this holiday from hell. Don't try this at home. Without a doubt this is a Christmas Comedy Classic from National Lampoon that will leave you laughing well past the new year.\n",
      "Becomes more popular each year because of the story line and the acting is actually good. I'd recommecd it to anyone who is tired of the mushy Christmas standbys.\n",
      "Now one of my all time favorite Christmas movies and no doubt the funniest, I recommend this movie for everyone to see.\n",
      "this is my favorite christmas comedy. the laughs never stop, but the underlying message also comes through loud and clear. great casting also.\n",
      "This is by far one of our best Christmas movies to watch.  No matter how many times we watch it...what a funny, entertaining movie about the holidays.\n",
      "This is one of the all time Christmas Movie Classics.  We watch it every year and always seem to find something we hadn't noticed before.\n",
      "I don't like all of the vacation movies but this one was one of the best after the first one of course.\n",
      "A classic we watch every year. Many many laughs and good message about the season and family. Worth buying in DVD format since our VHS copy is now unplayable.\n",
      "We have been watching this movie since VHS tape.  Then we switched to DVD, now this will be the first Christmas we watch it in Blu-Ray.\n",
      "What can I say that isn't said over and over here already. But I do have a question for a real long time Fan. Has anyone seen a  version that had the out takes. What I'm talking about is in the DVD case when you open it there is a picture of the Griswolds at a Christmas Tree lot that has different color trees \"Pink\" \"Blue\" and Clark is talking to the owner. I'd love to see an out takes version maybe with the cast talking about it too.\n",
      "It was great all the way through. When the cops raid the place--see what DeAngelo DOES--you,ll bust out laughing.  I felt sorry for the hard time Chevy had. Randy was a case and the old man with the stoogie--great movie.\n",
      "Bought this to add to my holiday collection and watched it several times. Forgot how funny this and the original were\n",
      "The perfect christmas 80's movie. Great for anytime that you want to just sit and relax anywhere. I love this movie!\n",
      "A classic in so many ways. Chevy Chase is outstanding in his deadpan delivery and in delivering great comedy. I've watched it many times\n",
      "I know this is a 'Christmas Classic,' but it's not my favorite. Yes, it's funny and it's part of the National Lampoons franchise but I really think it's a 'love it or hate it' sort of film. The reality of the 'slightly dysfunctional' family during Christmas is probably comforting for many viewers but has never really appealed to me.\n",
      "With apologies to Jimmy Stewart and Ralphie Parker, this is my favorite Christmas movie of all time.  If you are reading this because you have never seen \"Christmas Vacation\", stop right now and go to the video store and rent it.  Then come back here and order your own copy because you'll want to watch it over and over again each holiday season.The undisputed gem of the National Lampoon 'Vacation' series, the plot can be summed up very simply:  idealistic family man Clark Griswold wants to host the perfect old-fashioned fun family Christmas.  As all of us idealistic family men have discovered, there is no such thing as a perfect holiday, and that just about sums it up.  The appeal of this film is that we can all relate to the disasters that holidays can become, regardless of how well-meaning we are and how hard we work to achieve them.The cast is terrific.  Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo (Ellen) are back as the Griswolds, with Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki assuming the roles of Audrey and Rusty.  John Randolph and Diane Ladd are Clark's parents, while E.G. Marshall and the ultimate mother-in-law, Doris Roberts are Ellen's parents.  Nicholas Guest and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss are Todd and Margo, the yuppie neighbors.  William Hickey and Mae Questel (the voice of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl) nearly steal the show as Uncle Lewis and senile Aunt Bethany.  Randy Quaid does steal the show - his \"cousin-in-law\" Eddie is one of the all-time great characters in recent comedy history.The self-inflicted situations that befall Clark in his holiday quest are peppered with memorable dialogue and slapstick, yet believable enough to bring flickers of recognition to most viewers.  Witness his mishaps on the roof putting up the lights; getting trapped in the attic; spending his Christmas bonus before he gets it; dealing with his snooty neighbors; and getting hilariously tongue-tied at the lingerie counter and being remarkably eloquent when he gets his \"bonus\".  Admit it.  We've all been there.A holiday movie should be one that holds up to repeated viewings, and this one does.  Besides the excellent cast and the familiar situations, there is a great score by Angelo Badalamenti (Twin Peaks), the animated opening credits sequence, and some fine tunes such as \"Hey Santa Claus\" by the Moonglows!  There are numerous little touches that you might not catch the first several times - check out the shape of the packages in Mr. Shirley's office when Clark gives him his gift, and see what happens to the light bulbs Clark puts in the cart at the Wal-Mart.I suspect, like in our home, \"Christmas Vacation\" has become a sort of institution in many homes each holiday season.  We like to get together with friends to watch it, with everyone dressing as a character from the movie.  We eat green jello with \"cat food\" in it, stand and join in the Pledge of Allegiance and the Star Spangled Banner, recite the lines along with the characters, and give thanks that our holidays are at least a little better than the Griswolds'.\n",
      "A classic to be enjoyed by anyone who just loves being with their family over the holidays.  Let's face it there is a little Clark Griswold in all of us!\n",
      "Beyond Christmas, this movie makes me laugh.out loud no matter what time of year.  Now, I have it to go with the other Chevy Chase Vacation movies. Beautiful poo packaging and speedy delivery didn't hurt either.\n",
      "this movie is by far one of the best Christmas movies ever. it is no doubt in the top 5 on everybody's list. and bluray makes it that much better.\n",
      "This is an older film, but it has become an annual holiday favorite with our family. It is enjoyable for the young and old alike.\n",
      "There's really not much more to say.  This movie has been a part of my Christmas routine for years and the Blu-ray format makes it that much better!\n",
      "I remember watching this as a kid with my folks!  My god is it funny.  It is funny EVERY time you watch it, it never gets old.  To top it off, Rusty is Leonard from Big Bang.\n",
      "This movie is a Christmas classic. It never gets old! Great for getting in the holiday spirit. Chevy Chase at his best\n",
      "Oldie but goodie. Can't really go wrong with this one , lots of funny moments and situations. Fun for the whole family.\n",
      "Wanna laugh, like a bit of sarcasm? Relax and enjoy Christmas with the most idiot family of America. Of ALL Americas. Funnier than their Europe trip.\n",
      "One of the greatest Christmas movies of all time.  Chevy Chase is hilarious along with the rest of the cast.  If you haven't seen this movie buy it!  If you have then you should already own it.\n",
      "Classic holiday movie. Very funny!  Have to watch it every year. Still finding little funny things that I had missed.\n",
      "Our family watches it every year. Ours is a large family and we can see all the personalities and incidences in ourselves (fortunately ours have never been so extreme but the nuggets are there). It is not a perfect movie a few jokes don't work as well as  the rest and there are few dragging sections but it is more than made up for all the classic comedy moments!\n",
      "This has been a movie we've watched for years at Christmas time.  We finally broke down and bought it this year so we could watch at our convenience.  A bit more cursing than the TV version, but that makes it a bit more funny to me.  I'm sure this is something we will utilize for years to come.\n",
      "This is probably the best Christmas comedy of all time.  Looks pretty good in bluesy considering it is a 90's movie\n",
      "Christmas holidays are never the same unles you have a chance to watch the griswolds challenge the unfortunate obstacles that the holidays present.\n",
      "I love the extra stuff packed inside of the awesome tin! The movie however, seems to be the same quality as the DVD. You would think they would have spent some time cleaning up the movie for it's Blu-ray release. This is one of my favorite movies of all time so it was still worth the purchase.\n",
      "I love this movie!  What a great show.  The Griswold's best as far as I am concerned.  Amazon Prime delivered a great and convenient viewing experience as well.  Great picture quality and responsive controls.\n",
      "I have seen this movie so many times and it always makes me laugh!  This is such a realistic (in a way)  view about the holidays, being a kid, being a grown-up, and just dealing with some of the iirritating, crazy making experiences we have probably all dealt with at one time or another!  It's a \" must-see\"!\n",
      "Favorite Christmas Movie .... I do not have cable and have missed watching it for years so I finally purchased it.\n",
      "Let me say this is the first movie from the line of National Lampoon's Vacation movies that I've seen. I saw this with my family the year it was released with my family at the Cinema 12 in Muskegon which is now called the Cinema Carousel and we've watched it every December since. Having said that I watch this movie on my own any month of the year I want to as I now own it for myself. Teenagers will relate to the charachter of Audrey, pre teens will relate to Rusty, and many adults will relate to the stress Clark Griswold has at being such an everyman who tries to keep the family together while having a few disasters commited by him or herself plus the rest of the goofy relatives.Now that I'm old enough to do so I also own the original Vacation which came out the year after I was born as well as European Vacation which came out not so long after but Christmas Vacation was and still is the best of the series. It's good for laughs at Holiday time or any other time of the year. My favorite scene? The squirrel and dog chase. My reason for that is a squirrel got into our house the year before the movie came out and our family's comments at that time were like lines out of the movie. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that young kids or easily offended people should steer clear of it but for those of us who understand the humor and relate to it it's an absolute must have.\n",
      "It is a family tradition to watch this movie each year. It is hard to say no at this price for the blu-ray!\n",
      "After watching this year after year with my brother-in-law, it seemed just perfect that he gave me my own copy of the DVD when I went out to live on my own!  How excited I was to sit down one night with dinner and this movie, to listen to what I thought would be a tremendous commentary on the movie's background, technical features and trivia.Not so.  First off, there were a lot of people talking on the commentary track, so many that I couldn't keep track of who was saying what.  Then, the content was definitely nothing special.  It seemed almost like they didn't know what to say, so they just filled it up with comments about Beverly D'Angelo's hair or other stupid things.  Plus, since this commentary track was obviously added long after the movie was made, most of the people involved had forgotten most of what it was like to make the film.I also think that this film deserved a few better extras than just the commentary track.  Any outtakes or deleted scenes out there?  How about even a few bios of the cast and crew, especially since this was an early film for many actors who went on to bigger and better things?Now, the movie itself . . . a Christmas classic, of course.  My family watches it yearly around Thanksgiving, and my brother-in-law and I actually quote Randy Quaid throughout the year to one another.  We love the humor because, in each one of these characters, we find someone that we know in our own family.Because it is such a beloved family movie of ours, I have to give it at least four stars.  Like many other people here have said . . . if you don't own a copy of the movie yet, go ahead and grab one.  If you do have a copy, you aren't missing much.\n",
      "This is one of those movies that keeps getting better every year you watch it. It's become a tradition in our family to watch this at least once.\n",
      "My family watches this movie several times during the Christmas holidays.  It warms the heart.  Too bad there are not more movies like it.  We love it!\n",
      "Chevy Chase did a great job in this movie as well as most of the cast.  Not many slow places except for maybe when he is in the attic.  An unfortunate amount of bad language which makes it not kid friendly and a few scenes they could have done without. Overall a really funny movie.\n",
      "A must see! We watch it every Christmas. Chevy Chase is so funny and Randy Quaid brings in the laughs as well as cousin Eddie.\n",
      "Classic Chevy Chase.  Shame his later career faded from his highs in Caddyshack and other Lampoon films.  Like many actors Chase has let his politics taint his talent.\n",
      "Another hilarious movie by Chevy Chase! This Christmas movie is perfect to show around the holidays!!  Especially, if you really enjoy being with you're  family.. This movie is a perfect fit!\n",
      "Loved this movie when it came out and I think we have watched it every Christmas since.  No question we had to update to the Blu Ray on this beloved classic.\n",
      "Ended up watching this the other day ... a school snow day.Had to tell my 9 year old to forget some of the words he heard but we both laughed and laughed.All the words are things he's heard ... just not things we say.Funny and Fun!\n",
      "I love watching this movie all year long. I have it on VHS but VCR broke and had to get a DVD.\n",
      "This movie is a Christmas classic and I would recommend it to anyone!  Great deal for a blu-ray too!\n",
      "Always funny to watch.  Chevy Chase is hilarious and Beverly makes a perfect compliment as his wife.  Love cousin Eddy too!\n",
      "One of the best Chevy Chase films. Found it cheap in blu ray delivered in three days and enjoyed it multiple times since I received it.\n",
      "This is my all-time favorite Christmas movie!!  I can watch over and over again!!\n",
      "A Christmas tradition for our family. An annual event of lighthearted entertainment. I can't imagine missing it during the Christmas season.\n",
      "The movie ever for Christmas !  My family watch it every year and it still makes us laugh.  We've bought many of them as Christmas gifts.\n",
      "We love this movie, my grandson moved out and I decided he needed one of his own. Hes already watched it several times.\n",
      "This movie is timeless for anyone who has had a large family visiting for the holidays. We love our family very much but sometimes things happen\n",
      "This film is a favorite of mine as well as my grandchildren.  Have watched over and over.  You almost have to watch several times as there are so many classic lines.  I still laugh out loud and I am sure many people can relate to relatives coming to visit for the holidays. I loved the first movie Vacation but this one is my favorite.......\n",
      "For many, many years we start our Christmas holiday by watching this right after Thanksgiving dinner. Funny, funny, funny, funny!!!!!!!\n",
      "glad to have the dvd.  had it on vhs and watched every year.  glad to add the dvd version to my collection\n",
      "The movie is a Christmas classic.  It is one of our favorite Christmas movies.  Family during the holidays can bring pleasure and anxiety to many.  In this movie errors turn into loving joy.\n",
      "OF COURSE WHO DOESN'T LOVE CHRISTMAS VACATION! I HAVE RUN THROUGH EVERY ONE I HAVE BOUGHT OVER THE YEARS! NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE SEEN THEM I STILL WATCH THEM & LAUGH! THE PRICE WAS GOOD & IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT IN A WHILE ………….. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR & BUY ONE! WE HAVE GROWN OLD WATCHING THIS! MY GRAND CHILDCHILDREN ARE GROWN UP & NEVER SAW IT OR HEARD IT SO WITH POPCORN WE MADE A EVENING OF IT!\n",
      "A must to watch during the holidays.  There is no funnier one than this.  The product was in perfect condition and the shipping was fast.\n",
      "I love this movie regardless but I ordered the VHS to save a buck and I regret it...Next time I will order the DVD and not worry about saving a freaking dollar. BUY THE DVD\n",
      "I watch this every year. I have memorized most of the lines in the movie. Every character is hilarious and the situations are as funny year after year. If you want to laugh watch this!\n",
      "Great classic holiday movie one of my favorites - Chevy Chase is awesome, Cousin Eddie is a timeless character. This is a great movie to own and watch again and again any time of year!\n",
      "A now seminal Christmas movie, the Griswold's strike again in a Christmas classic about family, yet not necessarily for families, that most anyone can relate to. Chevy Chase at his best, lots of great situation and slapstick comedy to be seen here and a high re-watch factor. Interesting that it's called Christmas Vacation as in this film they actually don't go on a vacation.\n",
      "This movie is a classic, we watch it at Christmas time and all year long...just hysterical!!!  My kids and I love it!!\n",
      "this is a great all season family movie. we watch this all year round and never tire of it. everyone in my house has every word memorized and love acting along.\n"

      "Between A Christmas Story and Christmas Vacation, two of the all time movies to own, Christmas Vacation is one of my favorite comedies of all time and A christmas story is just a rememberance of my youth and how much fun the holidays were, a must own in anyones movie collection. The Blu Ray disc also brings out the best quality.\n",

His cousin Eddie puts the icing on the cake when he shows up with his family and \"puppy\".  Chevy's family reminds me of mine and probably most of America.  I'm sure most everyone has had an Aunt Bethany.  Of all the National Lampoon Vacations, I loved the Christmas one the most.  Go Chevy......\n",

Not us, along with \"A Christmas Story\", this movie ranks as the number 1 holiday viewing.A funny, funny, funny movie that I love. I have probably seen this movie 50 times and still enjoy it immensely!Better (IMO) than any of the other National Lampoon's Movies, by far!\n",
      "Our family can relate to this movie. It will make you laugh every time. It's hilarious and is a family favorite.\n",
      "This movie is funny from beginning to end - also like the original Vacation movie.  Christmas Vacation shows Chevy Chase as the 'daddy Griswold' at his best where everything that could go wrong does - from stringing lights, lighting them, the tree getting burned down by the grandpa, right down to the squirrel and dog (who chases it) destroying much of the home and the next door neighbor, who also gets in on the fun antics.  A good family movie that's up there with the other timeless yearly Christmas movie traditions like Miracle on 34th St., Home Alone, and A Christmas Story.\n",
      "My mate loves this movie he will be so shocked when he opens it Christmas eve night. Glad they had it on DVD and came in time for Christmas night....\n",
      "Most fun Christmas movie ever... My family even dressed as some of the characters one year...my husband has the Griswald hockey jersey\n",
      "Each year we watch Christmas Vacation, and it just gets better and better. Our old DVD was scratched and wouldn't play this year, and thus ordered a new one.\n",
      "Watch it every year and never get tired of it ! Laugh , laugh and laugh ! One of the funniest movies ever ! Gets you in the Holiday mood every year !\n",
      "Great movie. Great, great movie. A true Griswold Christmas. Cracks me up everytime. If you've never seen it or seen it 1,000x, I suggest buying it.\n",
      "This movie blends normal family angst and trials with humor and the wish for the perfect Christmas, which is never possible, but it turns out perfect for their family.  I bring in the season with this feel good movie and it usually keeps me company when I decorate the house or wrap the gifts.  It is definitely a tradition in our family\n",
      "Not a Christmas goes by without watching this movie at least 5 times. Hilarious! One of Chevy's best....if not THE BEST.\n",
      "As many have said, this goes down as not only my favorite \"Vacation\" movie, and my favorite \"Christmas\" movie, but also one of my \"Top Ten\" all time favorites !  How can you not sit and watch Clark try to put together his \"all time favorite family Christmas\" without feeling his frustrations ?  The characters are \"characters\", the dialog hilarious, and \"Eddie\" really knows how to dress and behave around people ;-)  I will bet you can find just one scene that reminds you of your Christmas past because there are sooooo many to choose from ! So sit back with some of Clark's famous eggnog \"OOO, that's good!\" and enjoy !\n",
      "The best movie ever. I watch this at least twice a year. It a all American Classic it is a must own\n",
      "Who could not love this movie? It is absolutely hilarious! I love to watch it any time of the year just for something to laugh about. We watched this over Thanksgiving weekend this year and two of my cousins had never seen it! It was so fun to see their reactions to the shenanigans of the Griswold family.\n",
      "Best Christmas movie of all time! Had to own it! Every year we do a Christmas movie night all through the month of December and this one is the first and last movie we watch each year!!! Don't bother renting this classic... you have to own it!!\n",
      "What can be said about this film that has not already been written. We watch this movie every Christmas just like \"Plane Trains and Autos\" during Thanksgiving. My 13 year old son absolutely loves this film.\n",
      "This movie is just one of those movies that will go on forever  - I watch it every Christmas & still laugh - a whole bunch of great characters in this movie -\n",
      "Love, love, love this movie!  My favorite escape from the Christmas craziness.  I quote it all year long.  Most entertaining!\n",
      "I finally bought my own copy rather than waiting to see it on tv. Hilarious movie- my favorite for years. This new blu ray was cheaper than a used DVD copy on an online auction site.  Shipped super fast.\n",
      "Words cannot describe what happens when your family sits down and watches this movie during the month of December. It doesnt have to be Christmas Eve or Christmas night, any night you happened to have free in December will do. We do it every year. And honestly every year, we hear a funny line we never heard before. We must have been laughing too hard the year before.Every family should own this movie. Seeing it with commercials on tv isnt as good as watching it all the way through the way it was intended. This has got bo the funniest holiday movie ever made. A Christmas Story is up there and so is the original National Lampoons Vacation but there is something extra special about this one.My wish for everyone is that they would be blessed with people to watch this movie with during the Christmas season.My advice is skip the ties and leather wallets and buy this movie instead - it will last longer and bring more joy.\n",
      "I'd rate it a 5, but the sound is a bit trying. Loud as heck during non-speaking, action parts; not loud enough during conversations. I'd buy a dvd instead.\n",
      "Great movie.  Just fun.  Yes it's stupid too, but so funny.  Have to watch it at least once every year.\n",
      "So funny! It never gets old! My 8 year old LOVED it! I'm certain we have a new holiday movie favorite!\n",
      "This is the Funniest movie of all time. We laughed all the way through it. Can't wait to see again.\n",
      "This is one of the best movies that tells it like it is when families get together for the holidays and the in-laws really do not like each other.  It is funny yet warm and in the end shows the true meaning of getting along for the holidys.\n",
      "Love this Movie My family enjoy that movie every Christmas .I also have given this as a gift Everyone likes it\n",
      "I love to watch this movie with my family every year. My daughters asked me to buy it so we could watch it more often without the commercials.\n",
      "This is a holiday classic that pretty much everyone can enjoy. They don't make too many pictures like this anymore.\n",
      "This if not already will be a holiday classic, This is funny and chevy chase is as funny as ever\n",
      "Like cousin Ed says in the movie,  it's the gift that keeps on giving. Great follow up to the first Vacation movie\n",
      "An all time family favorite that is sure to get you into the holiday spirit, and that every dad can relate to.\n",
      "Absolute classic and absolutely hilarious! Even better in HD! You can't have Christmas with the family without watching it at least once.\n",
      "This is great Christmas movie and fun for the whole family. Watch it over and over again and it's still funny.\n",
      "This movie never gets old. By far Chevy Chase's best movie. Everyone has a hokiday where everything has gone wrong but add these family characters and it gets out of control\n",
      "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a movie that never fails to score top marks every time. Even the truly horrible, full screen disc that was released a few years couldnt detract from the movie itself. When a 'Special Edition' was announced earlier this year, I was overjoyed! At last, this classic movie is going to get the teatment it deserves. Two discs, Widescreen, Commentary, trailers, making of, behind the scenes, interviews and deleted footage. But, lo and behold, when the 'Special Edition' arrived at my house, all it contained was the Widescreen version and Commentary. Nothing that would make it a special edition! On both DVD realeases there is a shot of the Griswolds collecting their Christmas tree with the site owner. This scene isn't included even though it was shot! Why include this shot on the packaging if it isn't in the finished movie? And why oh why are there no deleted scenes? If you have the fullscreen edition, it is a worthwhile investment to buy this disc (I can't call it a special edition) if only for the Widescreen element. All in all, Warners still treat this title with the contempt it totally doesnt deserve. And its even in a snap case not the better plastic cases that Warners are supposed to be using now! Hopefully by 2010, we will have disc that we truly can call 'Special Edition'.\n",
      "This is becoming a family tradition. One we watch every year. Now that we all have HDTVs it's time to upgrade from the tired VHS copy we have.\n",
      "My family and I have made it a Christmas tradition to watch Christmas Vacation since it was released.  We have other Christmas videos i.e., Elf, The Wizard of Oz, The Night They Saved Christmas, that we watch as well.Just a good wholehearted family get together during the holidays.Doesn't get any better!\n",
      "Lots of funny situations.  A bit sophomoric, but I like sophomoric humor.  One of the better \"Vacation\" movies.  My wife tapes it every year to watch and they keep cutting time from scenes so it was time to buy it.\n",
      "NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CHRISTMAS VACATION is one of those films that gets better over time.  Way back in December 1989, I approached this movie with some apprehension.  I thoroughly enjoyed the original VACATION film, but the absolutely horrible EUROPEAN VACATION seemed to spell doom for any future movies.  Fortunately for Chevy Chase, the FLETCH movies came along.However, CHRISTMAS VACATION was a pleasant surprise.  Okay, the soundtrack could have been more exiting and the tempo of the film would have been better if raised to the pitch of VACATION, but overall it was not a bad job.Beverly D'Angelo and Chevy Chase reprise their roles for a third time as Ellen and Clark Griswold.  Like their previous adventures, Clark sets out to create the perfect family event.  Unfortunately, his attempt to create a festive holiday environment turn out to be the recipe for near disaster.  Add some colorful relatives and Clark's klutzy accidents and you have CHRISTMAS VACATION.The best selling point of the picture is the potrayal, albeit exaggerated, of what happens when you fill a household with relatives.This DVD rates a spot alongside of other \"new\" classics like HOME ALONE.\n",
      "I love this movie I look forward to watching it every Christmas season its so funny, even my 7 year old son loves it\n",
      "Absolutely brilliant. Just the funniest film ever..!\n",
      "This dvd arrived quickly and I have been nothing but pleased with this purchase. The movie is a classic Christmas comedy!\n",
      "Brilliant cast, brilliant directing, so funny you will cry. A Christmas Classic. Doesn't get much better than this  Definitely a Christmas tradition.\n",
      "Always a family classic! Cannot go a year without watching this one. Helps me get into the Christmas spirit! Keep me in stitches even though I know what's coming.\n",
      "This is definitely a must watch!  You won't be disappointed, It's a Xmas classic that you can watch year round!\n",
      "This is our favorite family movie, we always plan to get the family together at least once before Christmas to watch it all together.\n",
      "Very funny classic holiday movie. Entertaining but somewhat dirty humor. Husband and I watch this each year and laugh each time,\n",
      "The funniest Christmas movie ever made! All the family dynamics in place for the holidays. Yo want this movie in your DVD collection.\n",
      "My family has always watched this movie every year at Christmas time. It is so funny and was a perfect stocking stuffer for my husbnad!\n",
      "Even though I know the lines and the gags, the movie never ceases to make me laugh. This edition has voice over commentary from most of the stars and the directors which we're making our way through. Lots of extra information about how they did the scenes, etc.\n",
      "what do i say this has the movie i watch at christmas and even during times of sadness ... it is the bomb\n",
      "I heard reviewers- claim that the movie is the best in the vacation series, I can't complain but this movie stands on its own. What are the holidays without caosis??? Every year we continually try to strive for a memorable Christmas.Well Clark GrIswols is no differant- but his good intentions go array in a hillarity of events from a physcotic squrriel to hillibily cousins-in-law to dried up turkeys and police busts. This Christmas IS hillarous. Clark Griswold sets out to make the perfect Christmas only problem is he FORGOT that means you also have to have family involved-dealing with the in-laws, and children is ALWAYS hard.He does his best lighting up the house so litterally it can be seen from outer-space. When Eddie his hillibee family show up things quickly go down hill. They have a disgusting dog, wildly children, and a bunch of character traits Clark can't stand. Making this Christmas HELL. But, even worse is Clark's fear that the pool he has already payed for will ruin him since, he hasn't recieved his bonus yet- making him TOATLLY on edge and unable to deal. But, what Clark dosn't realize is the imperfections in this Christmas are what are turning it into a Christmas no one will ever forget.Christmas Vacation exposes the crazyiness of the holidays and makes you realize that the imperfections in the holidays are what make it enjoyable. At the end when Clark says \"I did it\" you can't help but agree that this Christmas is one that will stay with you a long time. This movie is a great family Christmas flick to watch again and again especially during the holidays. All in all a great addition to your must watch Christmas list!\n",
      "NOT much to say but a classic movie its not a kid movie in some ways but my family enjoyed it\n",
      "Good supporting cast and many real-life situations with great humor - just like my family!  Too bad about the cat, though.\n",
      "We watch this movie every Christmas! We love it! The holiday season would not be complete without it. We look forward to it every year!\n",
      "Love this movie!! Watch it every holiday season. My son and I are always quoting this movie to each other. \"Get yourself something nice Clark\"\n",
      "This one is great for the holidays!!!!  You will be laughing all the way through this movie!  Makes you think about your own family craziness during the holidays.  I would recommend this one to all!\n",
      "Classic Christmas family comedy.  Anything that can does go wrong, but the spirit of the season pulls everyone through to a great ending.\n",
      "My family enjoys watching it every year and it never seems to get old.  One of the best \"Vacation\" movies in my opinion.\n",
      "Although it was a little early to watch a Christmas movie, we always laugh with this one. Absolutely, great on BluRay.\n",
      "One of the best movies of all time! You can't go wrong watching this anytime of the year! Love it\n",
      "Love it!!  It just wouldn't be Christmas without it!But, why isn't there a soundtrack?\n",
      "One our family's favorite holiday movies. Love the moose punch bowl set. Every household needs this movie to gt into the holiday spirit.\n",
      "It's one of the best holiday movies.  It's LOL hilarious and I watch it every year at Christmas time and enjoy every minute.\n",
      "I've always loved this movie and it makes me laugh as much as it did the first time I watched it YEARS ago!\n",
      "Best Christmas movie ever! A must have for Christmas movie lovers! We watch this every year and keep laughing all year long!\n",
      "I absolutely love this movie and watching it during the Christmas season is an annual event.So happy to now own it on Blu-Ray and can't wait to watch it. Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddieis comedy at it's best!!\n",
      "One of the best ever funny Chrismtas movies or Griswold movies for that matter.  On TV, they cut out a lot of the funny stuff (that they aren't allow to say).  We watch it several times a year around Christmas.If you've somehow never seen it, buy it, you won't be sorry.  If you don't have a Cousin Eddie in your family, be thankful.\n",
      "This movie has been a classic at our house since it came out.  This is my favorite National Lampoon's movie.\n",
      "Theres nothin that gets are family in the mood for the Holidays like Christmas vacation...This is one in the Vacation series that is superbly funny..Goin to anything involving the Griswalds is never a vacation...Thers a fire, Crispy turkey..Cousin Randy and more..This is truly a Christmas classic..\n",
      "One of my all time favorite movies  It has most of the cast from the first National Lampoon's Vacation hit.  Plus the snobby neighbors bound to make for a belly laughing good show.  Merry Christmas!!!!\n",
      "This is by far the best of the \"Vacation\" series. Kaughs throughout. It also had some very family oriented scenes.\n",
      "My tradition every year is to watch this movie, got to love it!!! It's silly, funny and downright a classic.\n",
      "Love this movie :) christmas wouldn't be the same without this holiday classic ! ! ! ! ! ! !\n",
      "It's funny, some people have reacted very negativly towards this movie, as if it mocks the sacred ritual of a family Christmas. To those folks I first say, get real, then I challenge anyone to claim that they never experienced a Christmas that was at least going in the direction of this already classic tale.In this movie we are back with this Griswold's, this time at home, and Clark plots to create the uiltimate, old fashiond, fun, family Christmas. Need we say more.From a run in with rednecks while they are tree hunting, to Clark's stringing up the outside lights, to a house full of often disinterested in-laws (VERY typical of our parents generation). Clark brings new meaning to the phrase, \"no good dead goes unpunished\".As noted by other reviewers, Randy Quaid is a standout as cousin Eddie, and his powder blue Leisure Suit. However he is almost trumped by the next door yuppie, Margo, played by Julia Dryfuss (Seinfeld's Elaine). Yes, someone played her husband, but Margo truly ruled her all too trendy roost. As a Christmas present to us all Margo has an encounter with a squirel, and then Decks The Hall with her husband, Todd.Is there a lesson here?, yes, think hard and fast before planning your own fun, old fashioned, family Christmas. Although this movie has the true to form, Hollywood Happy Ending, not all fun, old fashioned, family Christmasses end happy.However, most imporatntly, this movie is a comedy, and enjoy it as such. A great feature of Christmas Vacation is that you could watch this movie every night for a week, and still pick out something new. Watch for the scene in the house with the TV broadcasting the Chicago Christmas Parade, and the now legendary scene with Clark shopping at Marshall Feild's.I noticed that you can buy this DVD in a bundle pack with the more recent movie, A Christmas Story. Sorry, but in my opinion, A Christmas Story is the most annoying Christmass movie EVER.A better choice for a Christmas Double feature?, pair this with the true classic, Miracle on 34th Street (see my review), or the campy, often overlooked, Christmas In Connecticut.\n",
      "One of my all-time favorite movies! Love the Griswold Family. Have to watch this movie every year. Is a Classic and is Hilarious!\n",
      "Anyone who has watching this movies know. Just a great funny movie. I've watched this movie every year for Christmas since I was born. It's my dads tradition to and I'm hooked. Got him this blue ray to replace his OLD SCHOOL VHS. Haha\n",
      "Hard to describe the movie without fear of chuckling like a little kid.  Absurdity, mixed with ridiculous family situations, thrown on top of a traditional family man who wants nothing more than to have a huge Christmas gathering.  It's a must watch and be prepared - you'll be reciting lines from the movie for the rest of your days.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite holiday movies, nothing gets me in the christmas spirit than this movie. I absolutely love COUSINEddie, hes a hoot. I laugh from the beginning until the end.I even have my little nephew's and niece wanting to watch thismovie when they come over, and it doesnt matter what time of year it is. We all love it!!!!\n",
      "It wouldn't be Christmas without the Griswolds! Wish I could find the version that shows Snot drinking out of the nog bowl before Clark, seems impossible to find these days. Always delightful to show to someone who hasn't experienced the Christmas Vacation, turns into a tradition instantly!\n",
      "The family and I have watched this movie over and over the past week. Love it on bluray! the only way to go. Id recommend watching it with out any drinks around, just to make sure you dont spill laughing so hard.\n",
      "This movie has been a tradition to watch every year. I laugh every year like I had never seen it before. Love it.\n",
      "A true classic that is perfect to watch any time of year. It is the type of movie that leaves you howling.\n",
      "Classic movie, Chevy chase at his best. It is a must see Christmas movie. All time favorite to watch !\n",
      "One of my favorite Christmas movies.  I watch it every year!  It's a Christmas tradition in our house. Fun movie to watch.\n",
      "Never gets old! Even had kids cracking up this year.  Chevy chase at his finest (along with Fletch). Beverly DeAngelo was \"fine\" as well at the time!\n",
      "This movie is a Christmas classic that everyone should see. Definitely a holiday tradition at our house. Gotta love Chevy Chase!\n",
      "Great movie. We have watched it several times so far. Got it in a wrapper like brand new. Enjoyment year round now!\n",
      "I love this movie. It isn't secular Christmas until I've seen it each year. (I know it isn't the 'reason for the season.' That's the \"other Christmas\".) Every time I see it my appreciation grows deeper and I see it afresh. \"My favorite part\" changes every year!\n",
      "This is one of my family's favorite traditional Christmastime movies.  Classic Chevy Chase humor and outstanding script.  We have seen it so many times, all of us can do the dialogue!\n",
      "One not to be missed in your Christmas film collection, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a treasure trove of Christmas spirit, giving, and familial bliss during the holidays--or the lack thereof for the majority of us.Christmas cheer gone awry is the tone for this one and it'll put a smile on your face from start to finish.  Nothing says Merry \"EXPLICATIVE\" Christmas like this film--a must see during the Holiday season and all year round.\n",
      "This is a classic! We watch it every Christmas and several times through the year! Every home should have a copy!\n",
      "It's not perfect, best acted, or pure family fun, but the film is heartwarming, hilarious, and enjoyable in guilty ways.\n",
      "I would include this among the new Christmas movies, alongside Elf and Home Alone.Or Scrooged might be a more apt comparison.Most of the National Lampoon movies are fair-to-middling; if you watch this one enough times it becomes great.Also, it beats Miracle on 34th Street any day.\n",
      "One of the movies our family watched every year without fail.  We just upgraded from our old VHS to this DVD.\n",
      "a classic movie still amusing every time i see it, i would rent it again next Christmas, great family movie\n",
      "Clark: Hey, Kids, I heard on the news that an airline pilot spotted Santa's sleigh on its way in from New York City.Eddie: [after a pause] You serious, Clark?\n",
      "Have this on VHS and wanted the DVD. Love, Love, Love this movie!! Watch it every year at the holidays!\n",
      "This is a \"must see\" at our house. The Christmas Season doesn't officially start until I put this in the player (usually in late November) and let it play. I think the only movie that I can quote more than this one is Spaceballs! :)\n",
      "This classic film makes me laugh year after year.  It wouldn't be Christmas without viewing with family as we enjoy time with each other and  our favorite Christmas treats.  The visit from Eddie and the chaos of family get-to-gathers is so familiar to most of us.We look forward to side-splitting laughter each time we watch it.  Love it.\n",
      "I watch this every year and it just seems to get better with age!!  I love it, I will watch it again next year.\n",
      "I gave this movie 5 stars, because I Love Love Chevy Chase... He's definitely a character. Always get a good laugh with all of his movies.\n",
      "This is my favorite Christmas movie ever!  If you don't laugh throughout this movie, you should have your head examined.  Uncle Eddie is hysterical and gross all at the same time.\n",
      "Who can't love this movie? By far one of my favorites, if not, favorite Christmas movie. This is an excellent movie any time of year.\n",
      "It has been around a long time and we still enjoy watching it every year.  It makes us laugh even though we have seen it many times.\n",
      "Don't get tired of the off the wall jokes and antics.  My husband watches it every year, part of the tradition now.\n",
      "This is one of the funniest Christmas movies ever! Love it. I watch it every year with the family. :)\n",
      "Anyone that celebrates the Holidays can sympathize with the main character and his family.  If you are in need of laughter this movie will do the trick..Thank you to Amazon Prime for offering such a favorite as this movie.\n",
      "One of my all time favorite holiday comedy movies.  Characters are all acted well. Not for younger kids.  Get ready to laugh at crazy situations Clark gets himself into.\n",
      "Great movie. A Christmas classic. Everyone in the family will enjoy it. We have made it a family tradition to watch it every year at the beginning of the Christmas season to kick off the holiday!\n",
      "This is a good clean funny Christmas movie.  Chevy Chase is one of the last good clean fun actors.  This movie will keep you laughing through the whole thing.\n",
      "It's my all time favorite Chrustnas movie. None of those sappy sweet ones even come close. There's too much of Clark in me and too much of the Griswolds in my family not to love it.\n",
      "This is one of the top best Christmas movies of all time so i'm not going to try to sell you on something that sells itself. The Santa hat that comes with it comes in a vacuum sealed bag witch is good and bad the bad the white lining has a faint red color in a spot or two but its light and silky to the touch, coasters are great to bring out for the holidays, snow is still in the box and will continue to stay there. The button is a cool little price of memorabilia. So it is worth the low price of this item.\n",
      "Makes me laugh every time I see!  A joy to watch with family and hear all the laughs.  It has become a tradition to watch each year.\n",
      "I bought the BluRay version & watched it this past Christmas, it works perfectly! I can finally watch this without missing parts & getting frustrated by it skipping.Overall: Awesome! Very fair price, I highly recommend the BluRay version.*IMPORTANT: My low rating (initially 1/5) had NOTHING to do with the movie/storyline itself, but was strictly based on the actual DVD.I bought the Special Edition (2003) DVD several years ago for my mom as a pre-Christmas present; it's one of our all-time favorites to watch around the holidays. Unfortunately, the movie cut out in 2 different places, the first cut is when Clark plugs in the house lights (hilarious!) & the second was near the end, it skipped so far that it jumped to the end credits, we missed a good 5-10 minutes. My family is careful when handling DVDs, so no, this isn't related to scratches or fingerprints; in saying that, I still tried cleaning the DVD anyways with no success.\n",
      "This is one of the funniest Holiday movies ever.  I can watch it again and again and never get tired of it.  It is a classic.\n",
      "Just had to add this classic Xmas film to my collection. Just brought me back to the Griswold days. Crazy humor!\n",
      "We always have to watch this during Christmas.It wouldn't be Christmas without it!\n",
      "You've seen the edited version on TV. This is the original, uncut version. It's the way this movie was meant to be viewed.\n",
      "DVD was HD and didn't realize it would not play in a regular DVD player, but this was my own fault, not the seller's, in overlooking that the DVD was advertised as Hi Def.  Emailed seller, and seller was very prompt in responding & explaining why the DVD wouldn't work for me, and very willing to please me & even offered to give me credit toward another purchase.  Therefore, would recommend doing business w/seller and would not have reservations of purchasing from seller again in the future.\n",
      "This is one of my all time Christmas movies. I grew up watching this movie, it was funny and all time one that I have to add to my movie collection. There was nothing that I dislike and yes I would recommend it to several friends,and family.\n",
      "A good reminder of how the Christmas holidays really areAnd the craziness that ensues. The way we accept ourFamilies no matter what\n",
      "Funny funny funny. This is a classic  and we Always watch it at Christmas. It's like a tradition in our family\n",
      "A family classic. We watch it every year with family and friends and it never gets old. The blu ray version is crisper and made it even better.\n",
      "This movie is a \"must\" for our household during the holiday season.  While some of the language is a little \"salty\", we continually laugh - even after seeing this movie more times than we can count.  It's simply hilarious!\n",
      "I love this movie especially the part in the Attic. I bought raycharles CD because of it. that spirit of Christmas\n",
      "I love this movie and watch it every year. It really brings your spirits up and puts you in the holiday mood.\n",
      "It's a classic Christmas comedy that does not disappoint.  There is not much more one can say.  Chevy Chase is at his best in this movie.\n",
      "The Griswalds are always a hilarious troop. But with their families coming together for Christmas, anything can, and does happen...\n",
      "This has to be very close to the top of my list as extremely funny movies. One of the best of the bests. And Chevy Chase has so many facial expressions that remind me of my brother and his crazy humor,which makes this even more realistic to me. Thank you for a wonderful Christmas movie for the whole family to watch and laugh together with.\n",
      "It was funny and the family enjoyed it.  A Christmas favorite in our home.  We laughed again as if we had seen it for the first time.\n",

      "Very silly movie that makes me laugh out-loud every time I see it. There's not much I'd change about it.\n",
      "It is a must see for the holiday season -- for older teens and adults. The lanuage is not \"kid friendly\"... the move we see every year on television is edited to be the more family friendly movie we all know and love.\n",
      "This is our favorite Christmas tradition.  Chevy Chase is a genius and this movie is hysterical!  It wouldn't be Christmas without this movie.\n",
      "Even though they run it on regular TV every year, the original with all the off color humor can't be beat.  It's a family tradition in our house.  A great, great movie with a great message.\n",
      "This movie is a family favorite. We all have parts of it memorized and refer to it often.  It is hands down the best Christmas movie EVER !!! Very funny with a lot of heart. We watch it every year without fail, wouldn't be Christmas without it. We all can relate to the characters in this movie, the crazy aunt, redneck cousin and the brother / sister dynamics. Just so familiar.\n",
      "Love this movie.  I cannot count the number of times we have watched this over the years.  Our favorite Christmas movie.\n",
      "THIS MOVIE WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH.  IT IS A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE. IT WILL PUT YOU IN THE MOOD FOR CHRISTMAS\n",
      "This is a Christmas Classic! Stop what you're doing right now and watch this movie if you haven't already! Best Griswold adventure!\n",
      "Hard to resist watching this every year! Somewhat dated, yet still many funny moments. Classic Chevy Chase. Merry Christmas to all!\n",
      "Our family lists this movie as our favorite comedy Christmas favorite. How like so many of us who envision fantastic results but end up with mud in our faces.\n",
      "THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES...SO FUNNY...THIS IS CHEVY CHASE AT HIS BEST...WE WATCH THIS EVERY YEAR AND WE STILL LAUGH SO HARD...\n",
      "This is the revamped 2010 version(I watched it on a new panasonic blu-ray dvd player and plasma tv)and thought that the picture quality was very good.I've heard some people on here say that the picture quality sucked but I had no problems with my copy.the movie is a classic and can be enjoyed by the whole family(my wife even loved this movie)so I guess if you buy this dvd from amazon you should get the 2010 version(there was a 2008 copy going around and I believe that this copy is the crappy picture quality version)so be carefull where or from whom you buy it from(make sure it's the 2010 version and you should be alright)enjoy!it's a funny movie.\n",
      "This is one of the great Christmas movie.  Not only for the comedic value but because it reminds me of my parents and family.\n",
      "Totally hilarious! I look forward to watching this every year, and now I finally have my own copy. I love all the National Lampoon Griswold family movies but this one is my favorite!\n",
      "They never need to do a re-make on this movie ever.  Chevy Chase makes this movie and all the characters involved.I still laugh and so does my whole family even though we have seen it every Christmas for years.Add this one to your Collection.\n",
      "This is one of the best movies for the holiday's.Our family watches it every year.I highly recommend Christmas Vacation.\n",
      "This movie is a classic! One of the funniest holiday movies around. I highly recommend it! It's a must see during the holiday season!\n",
      "Chevy Chase is back again, to keep us laughing through the holidays! I have never seen this movie, wasnt always a fan of Chevy Chase, but during the holidays i ended up seeing it with my family.  I absolutly loved it!  Everything in this movie you can laugh about!  Chevy Chase is a typical man in the movie, needs to have everything perfect, but with his luck, everything goes bad...and its hysterical!  This is the best movie to watch around the holidays with your family.  I HIGHLY reccomend this movie!!!!  Now, its tradition to watch this movie every year!\n",
      "This is without a doubt the best Christmas movie ever made. Our family watches every year at Christmas. It's fantastic. Chevy Chase's efforts to put on a family Christmas are hilarious, and the visiting family really make the movie. Lieing around as a family on Christmas Day, and letting all the good food digest, while laughing at other's misfortunes is perhaps not in the spirit of Christmas, but it's how it works at our house. \"Drumroll please...\" and \"Shitter's full!\" are hollered across the loungeroom by all always a couple of seconds before the actors say it on screen. A must see Christmas classic!\n",
      "This is a Christmas classic tradition for us to watch every year around Christmas. It's a must watch! It's hilarious!\n",
      "This is one of my favorite Christmas movies.  Had to get it on DVD as my VHS tape wasn't tracking right anymore.  So funny!  Love it!\n",
      "This is the funniest Christmas movie ever made.  It's a Christmas tradition to watch at our house and I have past this on to my daughter who also loves it.\n",
      "If you do not laugh during this movie, check your pulse! This is Chevy Chase at his best. A family favorite for decades!!\n",
      "This movie has got to be one of the funniest I've seen. I watch it every year and decided to buy it. Now I don't haave to wait for it to come on TV. Simple hilarious!!!\n",
      "I LOVE THIS MOVIE! This is a movie for the ages! My family watches it every year for a Christmas tradition, usually because my brother gets it for my mom when we buy a new machine (we have it in video, laser disc, DVD and blu-Ray!). This is definitely a tradition I'm going to keep with my new growing family! Can't wait until the kids are old enough to watch it!\n",
      "Make watching this movie a Christmas tradition in your home after trimming your own tree!  Hilarious from start to conclusion.  Fun for all ages.  Every family should have a copy.\n",
      "If you like Chevy Chase, you will cry (from laughter) for his frustration over what befalls his high expectations of the love and warmth of having the family for Christmas.\n",
      "This show is amongst the Christmas staple movies. Each year we watch this movie for a good laugh. Hard to believe that there are others out there that haven't seen this movie but my in-laws saw it for the first time this season and they were laughing through the whole movie.\n",
      "this is a funny christmas movie. i recommend it!!!! 100 percent laughs.  good for older kids to adults.. it is very funny\n",
      "Do you remember why Clark Griswold needed his bonus check so bad??? To put in a swimming pool! [...]Cousin Eddie: \"I can't swim Clark!\" Clark: \"I know that Eddie.\" LOL\n",
      "Classic and goody!! The Griswalds are sooo funny in this movie and we can't forget about Uncle Eddie. Good times!\n",
      "I always enjoy a few Christmas movies before Christmas, but this is my absolute favorite.  I enjoy the way everything blows up in Clarks face when he thinks he has the best laid plans and his heart is in the right place wanting to make everyone happy.  I especially like when he needs an aspirin after a very long rant, as anyone that has done anything similar will be able to relate to the headaches the ranting causes.  Absolutely hilarious.\n",
      "A Christmas classic...always funny. Probably not ideal for kids but a great grownup Christmas movie. I love all the National Lampoon movies and this one does not disappoint.\n",
      "This is a must see movie every Christmas at our house, along with Christmas Story!  It never gets old.  Giving it as a gift this year!\n",
      "I don't know how many times i hace watched this movie and it always makes us laugh out loud, a classic!\n",
      "We watch this every December. It's even funnier because we start laughing before the joke happens. I think the whole family has it memorized.\n",
      "Our family loves this and I had to have my own copy to show at the family dinner Christmas Eve.\n",
      "This move never fails to make me laugh, no matter how many times I've seen it! Excellent cast; terrific storyline! Thumbs way up!!\n",
      "Great comedy movie! A must see each year at Christmas time! Would buy again, good price when on sale here.\n",
      "I grew up watching the Vacation movies with my family, so I've seen this many times. The humor is silly, not \"roll on the floor\" funny, but it's great if you just want to relax and watch a goofy movie you don't have to think about.\n",
      "I just love this movie!  So funny and clever.  We watch this movie every Xmas.  It wouldn't be Xmas without it.\n",
      "I already have this movie, of course, as it is somehwat of a classic to me.  But it was so much clearer on Blu Ray.  Especially the cartoon part in the beginning.\n",
      "This is our family's favorite Christmas movie. No one has as much trouble with the holidays as Clark W Griswold Jr! He certainly makes you appreciate what little hassle you have to go through at Christmas time. Great film to see little Johnny Galeki shine!\n",
      "Love this movie, I'm not sure that the blu-ray version makes much difference. Still kind of a grainy, early 90's movie. Definitely one of those I have to watch over and over during the Holidays!\n",
      "Hands down the best comedy in my mind.  I have seen this move so many times and every time I am lmao!\n",
      "This is the best christmas movie. It's hilarious and we watch it every year! It's right next to Home Alone for must see movies during Christmas.\n",
      "This is a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "What can I say about this movie?? It is simply the best holiday movie, hands down! It is a must around Christmas time, but anytime, really. Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Love this movie!  Doesn't get any better than this!!!  :)  We watch it in the spring, summer winter, or fall...  Awesome Christmas movie that we don't wait for Christmas to watch!!\n",
      "Replaced old VHS Tape with a blue ray of our favorite Holiday flick. Fast and easy!\n",
      "This movie should be mandatory viewing for every household that celebrates any holiday.  It is the perfect example of \"there is no such thing as the perfect holiday\".  Every December 15th I sit down with presents to my left, wrapping paper to my right, and turn on this movie as I start wrapping presents.  When the movie is over, I re-wind and play it again - and again - and again.  I've worn out three VHS tapes, and I'm working on my old DVD version.  I plan to get this new WIDESCREEN version as soon as it hits the shelves.  It keeps the holiday season in perspective for me - that there really is no such thing as a \"perfect\" holiday gathering.Clark W. Griswold wants one thing in life -- The Perfect Christmas.  What he gets is an hilarious mixture of uninvited relatives, feuding in-laws, cheapskate bosses, yuppie-neighbors, rampaging dogs, feisty squirrels, insensitive visitors, a dead cat, and one heck of a wild ride on a bobsled!!!For anyone that has ever wanted to have a perfect holiday, you must see this movie!!!  It will keep things in perspective for you.\n",
      "I have to watch this movie every Christmas. While I love many of the traditional holiday movies. I love this one. It has become a tradition in our house to watch Chevy and the gang on Christmas Eve.\n",
      "We just love watching Christmas Vacation every Christmas!  We watch it year after year, and we never tire of the comedy of Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid. This one is a true Christmas tradition for our family.\n",
      "Whenever I need a good laugh at Christmas I watch this movie.\\It is truly one of the best comic holiday movies of all time.\n",
      "Must watch every Christmas.  I have never seen my husband laugh so much.  It is good, silly fun.  And, it has a message too.\n",
      "It's a modern Christmas Classic that adds a little lighthearted comic relief when mixed with the other all-time classics of years past.\n",
      "This is my go-to movie when I want to get the Christmas cheer started.It's funny and great to watch again and again.\n",
      "It would not be Christmas without this flick. An all time favorite, super super FUNNY.\n",
      "I always buy my videos and cds from AMazon-top quality-quick ship. Best source for the best products you can buy\n",
      "just a fun loving spoof on those of us who never overdo anything!!!!! not stop laugh with a crazy SNL guy and his family\n",
      "This is hands down one of  the greatest Christmas movies of all time I always look forward to watching this movie around the Xmas holidays. This movie is great for all ages\n",
      "Received just what I wanted, the quality I wanted it in! Can't find this in stores and you know you are buying a quality item with no surprise damages! Love the movie super super funny! Couldn't stop laughing! Amost peed in my pants\n",
      "Hysterical classic for holidays! Chevy Chase at his usual delivers another family calamity! Rent it, you won't be disappointed at all!\n",
      "This movie has been shown in my family's households since it became available to bring home to watch. Everyone involved in making this picture did a fantastic job; directors, producers, writers, actors, to the wardrobes, sets, and music....The list goes on and on.It's a Classic for sure; I mean who doesn't know the pains of awkward family gatherings? Plus the hilarious moments that come out of those hours of supposed agony. hahaha. Comedy = laughter = best remedy for your heart, mind, and spirit!\n",
      "Great Christmas video for kids of all ages and adults too.  We play it many times every year and love it.  Laugh, laugh, laugh all through it. Gets us in the Holiday spirit.  The product was in perfect, unused condition from this vendor.  I recommend.\n",
      "A holiday must! Funny lines we use all year long. This year the we kids were old enough to watch. They've been asking to see it again even since.\n",
      "Hilarious movie! Classic Christmas comedy!  Great plot, all the actors are great, especially Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo. Will watch it again & again!\n",
      "It's not so much about Christmas, but it truly will make you laugh, and sometimes that is just what you really need.\n",
      "The best of the Vacation movies, Christmas Vacation ranks right up there with \"The Three Amigos\", \"Caddyshack\", and \"Fletch\" as one of Chevy Chase's best films. Chase can't take all the credit, however, as the fantastic cast (including Randy Quaid and a young Juliette Lewis) works perfectly to produce some incredibly hilarious scenes.One of the true classics of Christmas, this comedy should be essential viewing at each Yuletide season. And, while the DVD extras are sparse, it's the movie itself that really matters. And, in this case, the movie works perfectly.For having almost no flaws, and for providing years of holiday entertainment for the whole family, Christmas Vacation gets five stars!\n",
      "Love this movie. Not really a Christmas classic, but definitely a Lampoon's movie to remember. Of course Chevy makes the movie, but the rest of the cast is a fitting bunch. If you have never seen this movie then you are missing out on a great one.\n",
      "Always loved this movie!!! It's a Christmas Classic...a must have for any Christmas collection...I watch it at least once a week the whole season!!\n",
      "Once you watch it, you will be quoting lines for the rest of your life.  You will want Christmas to come just for an excuse to watch this movie over and over.  Was impressed with the streaming through Amazon prime.\n",
      "This is a real classic.  I ordered it as a gift but kept it for myself.  I love this movie.  It came in just days and was in perfect condition.\n",
      "This hilarious movie always gets us into the Christmas spirit, and never fails to crack us up no matter how many times we see it.  We finally got tired to trying to find it on TV and being interrupted by commercials, so we ordered it from Amazon.\n",
      "I watch this movie as many times as I can.  I don't know,all the things that happen can really happen.  He is so funny and especially when he is stuck in the attic!  But as I said I love this show and watch it as many times as I can even after the Christmas season!\n",
      "This is one of the best Christmas movies of all time! Was so happy to see it on Blu ray!\n",
      "Family watches this every year at Christmas and like all the other favorites they were on VHS and just had to upgrade to dvd.\n",
      "This is my husbands favorite movie. No one can ever top this one. A must have for families at Christmas\n",
      "I choose this rating because this movie is hilarious from start to finish, and I love Chevy Chase!! Lots of laughs!!\n",
      "It just isn't Christmas until I've watched Christmas Vacation.  It is hilarious!! I can watch it over and over, and I laugh every single time.\n",

      "Christmas Vacation is so funny, it makes your own family seem not THAT crazy!  This is a classic film, MUST SEE!\n",
      "Crhistmas classic, we all love it! Very entertaining for the whole family, including my three year old boy. Highly recommend it.\n",
      "I purchased this for my friend for Christmas. This is our all-time favorite movie. Anything that can make you laugh this hard is well worth the money. Came well packaged and on time. Thanks!\n",
      "What a fun, upbeat Christmas movie.  We cook all day Christmas Eve, every body is tired, time to wind down.  Simple, funny and touches the heart movie.  PS...we also have on our Christmas list of must watch:  Love Actually, Home Alone and The Family Stone.  If time in between events...The Christmas Story, Miracle on 34th Street, The Grinch That Stole Christmas, It's a Wonderful Life.\n",
      "This movie starts our family holiday season - we always watch it on or around Thanksgiving and we use many of the phrases in our every day conversation.  For instance . . . \"are ya serious Clarke?\"\n",
      "This movie has become a part of our Christmas.  Really puts you in the Christmas spirit.  One of our three favorite holiday pics.\n",
      "A true classic!Every year, I watch this movie to get me in the spirit of Christmas. Definitely a must-watch during the holidays, on a cold Sunday morning, with the snow storming outside, a warm blanket on your lap and a big mug of hot chocolate in your hand (don't forget the mini-marshmallows)!\n",
      "This movie has been a favorite Christmas tradition in our family for many years and we are all happy to have a DVD instead of our old VHS version.\n",

      "This is the funniest Christmas movie ever. All through the movie there are scenes that make you smile and laugh.\n",
      "this was one of Chevy C best films but it should have Been a Better Quality Tape--These Early Films was the Best of chevy\n",
      "Buy this and chill out have a laugh remember the good times.They don't make movies like this anymore. A must own no doubt.\n",
      "Love the first three National Lampoons movies this is proberly the worst of them ,but there is still a lotof very funny moments.\n",
      "If you like the original Vacation, you'll like Christmas Vacation. The humor is cruder and more exaggerated than in the original. Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) is given a more prominent role and he pretty much takes over the second half of the movie. Chase is great as Clark Griswold. The supporting cast is also excellent.\n",
      "We enjoy watching this movie every holiday season. It never gets old. Need more movies like it. I recommend it.\n",
      "One of the all time best x-mas movies, and on Blu-ray.  How can you go wrong?  A must buy, great on HD big screen.\n",
      "Another offbeat Christmas classic that has become as much a part of the holiday season as visiting Santa at the mall and overspending on the kids.The BD comes up very well - an improvement even over the DVD, which was pretty good. The extra features and commentaries are the same as those on the DVD, but they're worthwhile and entertaining.We probably watch this movie at least 3 times during the holiday season. Drives my wife nuts, but WTH.Recommended.\n",
      "It took me years to get around to seeing this movie but I was pleasantly surprised. It has to be one of the funniest in the series. So many on liners!Will watch again and again.\n",
      "Best seasonal comedy ever.  Should be added  to annual family tradition that should be viewed once or twice a season\n",
      "Chevy Chase at his best or worst? So much going on that it's a laugh a minute, and the nice couple next door.lol I think this will brighten most people's holidays.\n",
      "Enjoyed this Chevy Chase slapstick Christmas time comedy.  Gave me the good laughs I needed.  Well worth the time spent watching.\n",
      "I've seen this movie many times and it always brings a laugh.  The cast is great, and I particularly like Randy Quaid as the neo-white trash cousin.\n",
      "This movie is a Classic!  Chevy chase is hilarious.  Its a ritual to watch this before Cheistmas every year in my household.\n",
      "Our family loves this movie. For us it's tradition to watch it every year at Christmas. It is just an enjoyable movie that makes us all laugh!\n",
      "A great way to have a few laughs druing the hoidays. A silly movie but worth watching.Any time you want a laugh..\n",
      "This is a classic Christmas comedy that I watch year after year. The acting is good, and the plot is hilarious. Everyone I know that sees a house decorated with thousands of lights, calls it a \"Griswold house\".\n",
      "ordered two, only recieved one, still waiting! please let me know whats going on. Missing movie ,please send another one\n",
      "Great move the first time and all the times in between.  Would recommend to all those crazy families out there who love getting together at Christmas.\n",
      "This movie is hilarious! If you love great Chevy Chase this is a must have. It's great for Christmas time or anytime of the year. My son and I quote the movie because we've seen it so many times and it never really gets old. This year i bought it for my dad as a Christmas present and he loves having it.\n",
      "I watch this movie every year.  The DVD was in conditioned advertised and arrived in a timely manner.  I would recommend Amazon to anyone.\n",
      "This movie is a Christmas staple in our home!  It is laugh-out loud funny and reminds me of my own family in oh so many ways.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite Holiday Movies, this cast is in the best in the Vacation Movies. All the crazy relatives in one house, it's a zoo.Lot of fun LOL!\n",
      "The most hilarious Christmas movie ever.  Wonderful that National Lampoon brought all it's comic brilliance to bear on the subject of Christmas.  God bless the Griswalds every one!\n",
      "I already reviewed this and don't know why I have to do it again.  It's a great movie that I will be watching over and over again.\n",

      "This is my favorite holiday movie of all, it is so funny and brightens the holidays even more  Just tops\n",
      "This movie always makes me and my family laugh.  Totally over the top fun!!  Chevy Chase tries so hard for the \"perfect\" holiday only to be thrwarted by chaos at every turn.\n",
      "This film should be watched annually, along with A Christmas Story. Anyone who has ever had family and in laws over for Christmas will enjoy this one.This is arguably funnier than the original Vacation, and WAY funnier than European Vacation.\n",
      "This is a classic! Nothing gets me more into the christmas spirit than this movie. The picture quality is good.\n",
      "Classic Christmas movie.  Always so much fun.  Plus my soon to be father in law cracks up hysterically during the squirrel scene near the end.  Always a riot!\n",

      "best christmas movie ever. The gift that keeps giving year round! I watch it every year. highly highly recommended. !!\n",
      "What more can you say...I do recommend listening to the commentary on this one, entertaining for fans of the movie.\n",
      "One of the greatest Christmas movies of all time - definitely my number 1.  We watch this every year with the whole family.\n",
      "ONE OF MY FAVORITES.FUNNY, LOVE ALL THE CHARACTERS. CHEVY CHASE IS SO BELIEVABLE. COUSIN EDDIE IS AHOOT. BEV DEANGELO IS YUMMY.\n",
      "Full of fun. Plenty of amazing stunts and silliness !A must have holiday movie  for the Christmas fanatic and holiday lover.\n",
      "Best Xmas movie ever.  Maybe not better than theclassic cchristmas story but it is a super close 2nd.  Save me the neck!\n",
      "I've been enjoying this movie since i was a kid and was glad to see it offered on Prime. must see!\n",
      "Favorite Christmas movie of all time. I bought this as a present for my boss at work because he and his family had never seen it or even heard of it. (I know right!?) With Amazon Prime it came in two days. Just passing on a fabulous family tradition :)\n",
      "Still love to watch Chevy Chase and all the vacation movies. We watch this one every year so we decided to get the blu-ray. The kids love it.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite Christmas movies. It is a comedy that wraps up all of the holiday stresses into a movie.\n",
      "This is a holiday movie you can watch over and over and still laugh yourself silly! Chevy Chase is at his best and I rate this above the original Vacation. A must have holiday movie.\n",
      "If you love Chevy Chase see this movie..First off I am a huge fan of The National Lampoon Movies that feature Chevy Chase.  This is a very very very very funny movie.  It's one of the best!\n",
      "This movie is so funny and it is definitely a movie u are gonna wana make a part of your Christmas family tradition it would be a great movie to watch when you get the relatives together at Christmas.\n",
      "Love the holiday classics for any age.  Thoroughly enjoyed time and time again.  Gotta love Chevy Chase.  Classics, epic and funny as hell.\n",
      "We watch every year.  There are so many quotable lines......good fun.  A few f bombs though so not for grade schoolers.\n",
      "Just go ahead and buy it.  You've probably already seen it anyways so there is no need to think about it.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Forget that though.  If I had given stars for this as a special edition I would only give it 1 star.If you have the normal released DVD, this version is NOT worth double dipping.I think everyone knows what this movie is.  If you don't have this on DVD then great.. grab this version.  If you already have a copy of the older version, don't get this one thinking you will be getting something special.\n",
      "OK, I admit I was forced to watch it, but found myself enjoying it anyway. Chevy Chase is back once more, and from the previous ones I've seen, it's the most disappointing. There are a few funny moments, but they were predictable. How many times can you watch someone stapling Christmas lights (talk about going overboard with THOSE!) without knowing they're going to attach themselves to the roof, and then fall off the ladder? Having the dreaded family over makes me wish I'm not going anywhere this Christmas! You've got all the worst family members you can possibly imagine ... and then add some! The mum is at her best in this film, and the children are Juliette Lewis is an early role, but still looking & sounding the same, and the guy who later got a fish hook through the neck in I Know What You Did Last Summer. This isn't my fave National Lampoon Movie/Vacation movie. But it's a great movie to watch at this time of year - even though I keep complaining that I'm watching Christmas movies in the middle of November, and I want it to be Christmas NOW!!!\n",
      "A classic Christmas movie to bring some laughter and lightheartedness to the holidays. I never get sick of watching this movie.\n",
      "I've always loved this movie, it is a great Christmas classic. It is hilarious and heart warming at the same time.\n",
      "Entertaining for the whole family during the holiday madness.  All you need is a warm blanket, popcorn and your family.\n",
      "it's so much fun, the music and the craziness puts anyone in the holiday spirit. Adding to my yearly watch list.\n",
      "Absolutely hilarious movie that I've watched more times than I would care to admit.  This one will have you rolling around on the floor.\n",
      "This is one of the few movies that is funny no matter how often I watch it.  It's a favorite in my family and we watch it at least twice every holiday season (and once or twice randomly throughout the year).\n",
      "One of the best Christmas movies ever!!! Funny, yet wholesome. Great story telling without shock value. A MUST for the Christmas Season\n",
      "A holiday movie recently added to the 'classic' list. Not the funniest of all the National Lampoon's 'Vacation' series, but good for a few good laughs.\n",
      "Very funny time after time. As good as original and an every year must watch fit the whole family.  Z\n",
      "My husband loves this movie and I'm  glad to have gotten it in perfect timing. He was so happy to have it. His was lost a few months ago.  The movie plays fantastic. Thank you\n",
      "What can you say about this movie that hasn't already been said.  It is a must have around Christmas time.\n",
      "I have to watch this movie during the Christmas Season.  It is my tradition.  I can really relate to some of the things in this movie.  I know that sounds scary, but it makes me nostalgic especially since most of my family has passed away.  This movie makes me happy!\n",
      "These movies are always hilarious and Beverly D'Angelo she had it when she was younger what a gorgeous woman. The only thing that confused me was rusty and Audrey in the first few movies Rusty is older in this one he's much younger. Weird.\n",
      "4.5 stars.  I would have to say that this is my favorite Christmas movie.  My wife and I picked up the DVD Special Edition (which isn't that special, come to think about it -- just one trailer and a commentary track).It's rated PG-13.  I didn't remember anything all that caustic in it, so we let our four year old watch it.  Yikes.  There is a lot of swearing in this movie.  At one point, our daughter looked at us, giggled, and said \"That man said bull sit!\"  That's what she really said, but that wasn't what the man said.So, I'm in the dog house tonight because it was my idea to watch it.  Please, avoid this predicament by screening this movie if you aren't sure you want your kids using the words that the actors use.That said, I love the heck out of this movie.  It is well-acted, and well-scripted.  There are a lot of great bits such as the cat under the chair, the sled, the squirrel in the tree, Cousin Eddie and the sewer drain.... the list goes on and on.If you have never seen this movie, I suggest you buy it right now and watch it without delay.  Anyone that has ever attended a family Christmas will find a lot to laugh about.  If you haven't seen it in awhile, same thing.  This is a must-see Christmas movie on par, I think, with \"A Christmas Story.\"\n",
      "Yes people. I am this years Santa and if you don't think I see everything, guess again! Oh yes. I see you decorating trees, rushing and scurrying at the mall, knocking other people down to get to that last sale item. Then your anger reaches a fever pitch when you can't remember and can't find where you parked the car. Oh yes. From my green and red condo at the North Pole (which Santa generously let me use until Christmas Eve), I see all. Don't think for one minute naughty or nice doesn't apply right now. Elves are terrible gossips and will advise me up til the last minute.I settled down with some brandy and this \"Christmas Vacation\" DVD. Now, I know there are many Christmas movies out there that are attuned to some type of emotion. Some will make you feel joy and some will amuse and delight you. However, none of them stand up to the hysterical escapade that this movie represents. This is one of Chevy Chase's finest moments in comedy, playing the Christmas foil wrapping to our delight. I never fail to watch this at this time of year. It is essential. Revealing the essence of Christmas with all the absurd elements that truly do make it the unique holiday that it is.Chevy plays Clark Griswold, looking forward to his bonus check and a family reunion, inviting all the relatives to his home. The movie starts out with his car getting trapped underneath a truck and, from there, you know you are in for more disaster.The rapid-fire changing situations hit more often than miss your funny bone. Sometimes, you border on being hysterical with laughter. Yes, it is that funny. So many scenes that are good no matter how much you watch it.Some of my favorites? Chevy at a department store speaking to a hot woman at the lingerie counter. The naughty word play is just too funny, time and time again. (This young lady appears later in a scene whereby Chevy looks out at the imaginary in ground pool he plans to build, sees her, and his eye-bulging look as she whips her bikini at the window). As clever as your Metamorpho is, I don't know if I could come up with this on my best day.Do not forget his aunt's cat chewing on wires, the exploding turkey (with puffs of steam) and the squirrel who wrecks havoc and is the last straw for his tortured yuppie neighbors. There is just so much fun to this movie, and total disaster has never been more uproarious.I cannot tell you of each funny scene, but you must see it because this movie is definitely unique within this genre. So, put it on as you wrap your gifts. Just remember, the cat and jello are off limits!Drive my gift to my front door....Ornamentally yours -- Metamorpho ;)\n",
      "The poor Griswold family just can't seem to get anything quite right.  Full of family problems and egg nog, I must agree with some of my fellow reviewers that this is the best of the Griswold series.  There are some real laugh out loud moments here.  It's a zany romp through one family's Christmas holiday.All Clark Griswold wants is to have a good old fashioned Christmas holiday with the family.  What he gets is a tree that's too big for the house, an over crowded house full of both sets of grandparents, an unwelcome cousin and his family, a big dog, a crazy squirrel, a mean old uncle and his forgetful wife, a dead cat, a trashed house, a kidnapped boss, an invasion by aswat team, and an explosion, just to name a few items.Parents beware, there is a small amount of profanity.  There is no nudity or sexual content.  There is some mild violence.  While I didn't rate this one with 5 stars, I still believe that it is worthy of having a place in your Christmas dvd collection.Enjoy!\n",
      "Great Picture Quality Great Family Movie Except same bad language Very Funny. And a Great Movie to Watch During Christmas or Anytime.\n",
      "The best vacation movie.  Chevy along with the cast are at their Holday best and offer my household the best Vacation.  IMHO\n",
      "Probably one of the best Christmas movies every made.  This movie should be up there for your holiday viewing right along with the greats like White Christmas and A Christmas Story.  The movie stand up to the passing of time and even though the in laws are a little extreme, I'm sure you'll see bits and pieces of your own family and remember so crazy holiday meals you've spent with them.\n",
      "In 1983, theater audiences were treated to the outrageous comedy \"National Lampoon's Vacation\" featuring the fictional Griswold family thanks to the superb writing by John Hughes and direction by Harold Ramis.  In that film, the head of the Griswold household, Clark Wilhelm Griswold, Jr. (Chevy Chase), is determined to take his family on the best vacation ever by driving them from their home in the Chicago suburbs to the fictional amusement theme park in California known as Wally World.  However, things don't quite go the way that Clark had intended along the way.  Two years later, the Griswolds returned to the big screen in the rather disappointing \"National Lampoon's European Vacation\", which was directed by Amy Heckerling and co-written by John Hughes and Robert Klane.  Four years later (1989), under the direction of Jeremiah S. Chechik and solely written by John Hughes, the return of the Griswold family in \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\" was again as funny and well-written as their original 1983 film.Similar to the original \"National Lampoon's Vacation\", in \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\" Clark Griswold is determined that his family will have a traditional Christmas celebration at their home in the Chicago suburbs and invites his parents and his in-laws.  Clark's wife, Ellen Griswold (Beverly D'Angelo, who was also in the previous two films), does not share his obsessive enthusiasm, but goes along with him, including making a trip to the mountains to chop down their own Christmas tree.  Accompanied by their children, Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and Rusty (Johnny Galecki), to the mountains, the trip is hilarious as it doesn't go quite the way that Clark planned.  For outdoor decorations, Clark uses a ridiculous 25,000 lights to transform the Griswold home into what he thinks is the ideal Christmas setting.  Then, unexpectedly and uninvited, good ol' Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid, who was also in the original film) shows up with his peculiar family in their broken-down RV, which he parks in front of Clark's home.  More laughs ensue when Clark's parents, Clark Wilhelm Griswold, Sr. (John Randolph, 1915-2004) and Nora Griswold (Diane Ladd), and his in-laws, Art (E.G. Marshall) and Frances (Doris Roberts, better-known for her portrayal of Marie Barone in the TV sitcom \"Everybody Loves Raymond\", 1996-2005), arrive, as well as the cigar-smoking Uncle Lewis (William Hickey, 1928-1997) and Aunt Bethany (1908-1998).  With an electric-cord-chewing cat, a flaming Christmas tree, a disappointing Christmas bonus, family fighting and a SWAT team, \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\" is sure to make you laugh and encourage you to plan your own traditional, old-fashioned family Christmas celebration.Other memorable characters in \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\" include Cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn, who was in the original film), Cousin Rocky (Cody Burger), Cousin Ruby Sue (Ellen Hamilton Latzen), neighbor Todd Chester (Nicholas Guest), his wife Margo Chester (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), Bill (Sam McMurray), Mary (Nicolette Scorsese), Clark's boss Mr. Frank Shirley (Brian Doyle-Murray, who played the Kamp Komfort manager in the original film) and his wife Mrs. Helen Shirley (Natalia Nogulich).  Overall, I rate \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to everyone.\n",
      "A Christmas 'classic' i watch every year.  Very funny and worth having a copy.  The ensemble cast works well together and never a dull moment.  So many quotes.... 'Play Ball!'\n",
      "I decided to buy the Blue-ray edition to keep up with the technology. There are no Holidays without watching this classic at least once. You will get a laughter year after year!\n",
      "Every year since the movie was released on VHS and on TV we've always watched National Lampoons Christmas Vacation!! Have to say, Christmas isn't complete unless I've watched the movie!!!\n",
      "This is one of the funniest movies I have ever watched.  Definitely the best Christmas move in my opinion.  Any movie with Chevy Chase in it is bound to be good.\n",
      "Poor Clark Griswold! First he gets a giant tree that is WAAAAAY too big for the living room, then he decorates his house with thousands of lights that don't work until his wife figures out that it's merely a switch in the laundry room.  His mentally challenged but well-meaning cousin shows up in a REALLY beat-up motor home...too many hilarious situations to describe here.  Get it - you'll LOVE it!!\n",
      "I love the movie and it looks great, but some films just don't do Blu Ray justice.  Still, love the product.\n",
      "You would think with all the remastering that goes on today with movies being re-encoded to high definition, they would show some love to this classic holiday film. The video was clear and clean, but the audio was standard fare: 2-track stereo. No surround. I understand that the film didn't have it when it was originally released, but neither did 50-year old films that have had some ambient sound added for those who have home theater systems. I had just hoped for better sound, but at least I've got the HD version to last me until the 4K version arrives!\n",
      "National Lampoon Christmas Vacation DVD arrived on time and in great shape, this company did a great job, will use them again!\n",
      "This has become a Christmas tradition at my house. Every time we watch it we see something new and funny.\n",
      "A real classic!  Very funny, with a great cast.  A \"must watch\" flick when the family is together for the holidays.\n",
      "One of the funniest movies made! We watch this in late November/early December as an annual family tradition. We always rented, but decided to own it instead.\n",
      "This is a great movie!! Definitely one of my favorite holiday movies, I laugh the entire time. Chevy Chase's best movie.\n",
      "This is among my favorite Christmas films.  This and \"A Christmas Story\" (also just released on HD DVD).  A Christmas classic, and there really aren't all that many.  It just gets better and better each year!  Love the Yuppies next door.I've previous owned the VHS tape, the LaserDisc and the standard DVD of this film and this newly released HD DVD is by far the best!  Not a speck on it.  Beautifully restored... I'm really impressed with it's quality.On my 46\" Sony LCD widescreen it is a the total theatre experience, but I doubt that it ever looked this good in a theatre.  The detail, color and sound is just awesome.  The image fills the 16 by 9 inch screen.If you don't know this movie, it is just terrific.  From a script from John Hughes, it is just nasty enough to have the proper edge.  It is also a wonderful Christmas movie!!!If you have an HD DVD player, just order this!\n",
      "How can you not believe that this movie is the ultimate holiday movie of all time?  You can't, and if you believe otherwise, you need reexamine your life choices.\n",
      "A Classic that I grew up with... National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation has been on every holiday season since I was about 8 years old; and even today I use it to mark the beginning of the season- It's not Christmas time until Christmas Vacation has been on!My wife, several years younger than I; doesn't give this movie a fair chance and tries to write it off as being somewhat trashy.  It really is not; instead it is real life situations, along with a string of misfortunes, to torment a true family man who wants nothing more than to give his whole family a warm beautiful joyous Christmas.Another plus to this particular title is that you do not need to be a fan / follower of the other National Lampoon's Vacation movies... Not only do the Griswald's not travel anywhere like they do in the others... Someone with no idea who Clark, Ellen, Rusty, or Audrey Griswald are can sit down and fall in love with the family right away.  And- while this movie did sneak out just before the 80's ended (1989), it does have a much more modern look than the other Vacation movies, and the casting of the kids was spot-on; as I always related well to the Russ of this movie, but did not to the others.Anyways...  Watch it, watch it a few times this holiday season.  If by some chance you have a wife or girlfriend who doesn't know the film, 'tis the season to be Merry!Side Note--- My name is Michael, but thanks to this movie my Dad has often called me \"Russ\" shouting out things like \"Settle down Russ\" though-out the years; in reference to this movie.If you watch this movie and are disappointed, well, I wouldn't be more surprised than.... \"if I woke up tomorrow morning with my head sewn to the carpet\".\n",
      "a true tradition at Christmas. outlandishly funny and a must see and re-see. The griswalds are the \"typical\" family at christmas\n",
      "Just hilarious. Easy to use. Hooked laptop up to TV and had a perfect 46\" movie screen without having to run out for DVDs.\n",
      "Every year after Thanksgiving dinner we watch this as a family. We lost our dvd so I ordered the blue ray, it was good that we were also able to watch it instantly online because the package did not get delivered in time.\n",
      "I had not watched this in years.  Good revisit and a great amount of smiles.  Like my on demand video!\n",
      "My wife and I go through a bunch of Christmas Movies during the Christmas season, and this remains one of our favorites.\n",
      "This should be a classic staple Christmas moving for every red-blooded American's required holiday viewing list, right up there with A Christmas Story, How the Grinch Stole Christmas (the cartoon, not the live-action movie), the original Charlie Brown Christmas, and It's a Wonderful Life.  Even my wife likes this movie, and she is usually not into these types of movies at all.For those who have been under some rock, this movie features the continuing store of Clark W. Griswald and his crazy family adventures.  Chevy Chase still headlines, as does the same actress that played his wife in Vacation and European Vacation, but once again the kids were flipped out with new talent (probably because the old ones got too old).  The movie follows Clark as he tries to make the perfect family Christmas.  Loads of great, funny scenes.  We watched this via Amazon Prime streaming, and the quality of the picture and sound was great.\n",
      "My favorite scene is the one where he cusses his boss.  Classic!!Randy Quaid really steals the scenes in the Vacation movies.\n",
      "Showed to 10 grade classes in China as a treat. They loved it. Still hold up. It is a classic.\n",
      "This is the funniest Christmas Movie ever.Cousin Eddie steals the movie and Clark is the lovable goofball that is trying to go the best for his family.\n",
      "This movie is the funniest movie we've ever seen - it's a staple in our house.  We watch it every Christmas, but have also watched in the summer just for fun.  It's a laugh a minute - everyone should own a copy.  Doesn't get any funnier than this\n",
      "This is a must see movie during the Holidays!  I watch this movie every year and never get tired of seeing it!\n",
      "One of the Christmas movie everybody needs to watch. I have to watch this every year. It is part of my Christmas.\n",
      "Classis movie, one of my most very favorites.  Still find things in this movie I haven't seen yet, and I've seen a hundred times…  Heeeelarious!!!!\n",
      "This is a classic christmas movie. I watch it every year. I love it! CHEVY CHASE IS GREAT. A must see\n",
      "This is a must for everyone this Xmas season.  Purchased this as a Xmas gift!Watch and enjoy everyone, Happy Holidays!\n",
      "Bought this one for my family in Idaho. It's a holiday tradition that when I'm visiting them, we all watch it together and recite movie lines from it during dinner. Always great fun and HILARIOUS.\n",
      "The only NL movie that I like. This one has me laughing so hard.If anything can go wrong for Christmas, it will happen to Chevy Chase and his family! For a some laughter, watch this movie. I only recommend this movie for older audience for crude humor and language.\n",
      "I bought this movie because it is one of my favorite movies,I can watch it year round and not get tired of it\n",
      "This is one of those movies that is a must see on christmas holidays !!!!! If you haven't seen this movie then your missing one of the best christmas movies....\n",
      "This movie is a holiday tradition at my house. Classic Clark Griswold and crew with cousin Eddie. It put a smile on my face from the first time I saw it in the theater until today.\n",
      "My review focuses primarily on the Bluray disc specifically. The movie is a 5/5 but the Bluray loses a star for not being superior in anyway to a DVD.THE GOOD: Overall, this is a modern Christmas classic and one of Chevy Chase's best. The film still holds up over 20 years later and is still heavily enjoyable.THE BAD: However unless the DVD looked downright dreadful, the Bluray isn't very impressive. It doesn't seem like a newer digital transfer, as the video looks like something you'd see on regular TV, It's certainly no better than a DVD. If you already own the DVD version of this film, it's doubtful that the Bluray's video quality is anything better than what you already have (assuming your DVD player is capable of up scaling to 1080).The special features are pretty much non-existent, sans a commentary track and a theatrical trailer.Ultimately: If you have the DVD, but were thinking on upgrading to the Bluray, don't. If you don't have either, and the DVD is cheaper (and your DVD player can up-convert to 1080) then you might as well just get the DVD. The Bluray isn't any better or worse.\n",
      "First off, let's get the technical Blu-Ray stuff out of the way.  Warner Brothers have released some truly lackluster editions of the \"Vacation\" series, and unfortunately \"Christmas Vacation\" is no exception.  The \"Ultimate Edition\" Blu-Ray copy released in 2009  featuring the newer, green jewel case is the exact same copy (with only the blue color case changed) that Warner Bros. released in 2006.The picture quality never really becomes alive like you would expect from a Blu-ray, and is rather drab to say the last.  The 1.85:1 non-anamorphic print is about the same as the Special Edition, and there isn't the same amount of crispness and clarity that should be present for a high definition transfer.  Several sequences suffer from some rather dark video, and the audio is the Dolby Digital 2.0 Stero track from the original DVD releases.  Subtitles and mono tracks are available in French and Spanish.Special features include a full length audio commentary by Jeremiah Chechik (director), Beverly D'Angelo (Ellen Griswold), Miriam Flynn (Cousin Katherine), Johnny Galecki (Rusty Griswold), Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie), and producer Matty Simmons.  Notably absence is Chevy Chase.  The commentary isn't that revelatory but is passable as far as commentaries go.  For all the complainining about Chase not being on the commentary, this group commentary is miles [infinitely] better than the \"European Vacation\" commentary, which ONLY featured Chase.  Matty does reveal the studio nearly cut the fried cat scene, and only due to postive reaction from test audiences were they able to keep that in the movie.That leaves us with the physical merchandise: four coasters, \"I Survived A Griswold Family Christmas\" pin, a Santa hat, a small bag of snow powder ????, and a cheap plastic replica of the moose mug Clark and Eddie drink eggnog from.  Personally I wouldn't recommend getting the more expensive Blu-Ray versions of this movie - just pick up the cheaper editions.  You're pretty much getting the same product minus the physical merchandise.  Then again, who WOULDN'T WANT a small bag of fake snow powder and a cheap plastic Marty Moose mug?  That being said, let's move onward to the review.\"I don't know what to say, except it's Christmas and we're all in misery.\" No words were more aptly spoken.  After the rather disappointing misfire of \"European Vacation\", John Hughes and Chevy Chase return Clark W. Griswold to his former glory.  Hilarious, extremely relatable, and just as good as the original \"Vacation\", \"Christmas Vacation\" is one of those instant secular Christmas classics that become a tradition for so many families, just like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"A Christmas Story\" (a movie that personally I abhor).The movie features classic performances from Beverly D'Angelo, Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, the in-laws, and the two Griswold children.  Brian Doyle-Murry (Bill Murray's older brother) also returns to the franchise as Frank Shirely, Clark W. Griswold's boss.  He appeared in \"Vacation\" in a brief scene as a Kamp Komfort clerk.  Doris Roberts (who plays Marie Barone on my all time favorite sitcom, \"Everybody Loves Raymond\") plays Frances, Ellen's mother.  Also a pre-Seinfield Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, along with Nicholas Guest, plays a rather yuppy, above it all couple by the names of Margo and Todd Chester who operate as a foil to Clark's outlandish behaviors.  They find Christmas cliche and are not observant of any holiday traditions.  Naturally they find it difficult living by the Grisworlds, and throughout the course of the film encounter several obstacles and even extensive property damage.Like the original \"Vacation\", why \"Christmas Vacation\" has become such an endurable holiday favorite is its relatability.  John Hughes was truly an absolutely hysterical guy, but he crafted his films and scripts in such a way that people from various walks of life can watch his films and instantly identify with the mad-cap hysterics taking place on screen.  Yet both the aforementioned Vacation movies transcend mere slapstick into something deeper.  Also notable is this is the only vacation movie that is set in Chicago wholly, as the Griswolds not traveling but rather staying home for Christmas.Like \"Vacation\", \"Christmas Vacation\" shows Clark W. Griswold as an over-idealistic sentamentalist who just wants to give his family the best Christmas vacation ever, despite his zany, over the top antics and the \"threshold of hell\" that so frequently occurs.  We've all been in family gatherings that have gone ary.  Everything that goes wrong pretty much does, from a fried pussy cat, a burning Christmas tree, overbearing relatives, malfunctioning decorations, and bad relations with your neighbors.  Yet despite all his difficulties, ultimately Clark W. Griswold prevails in treating his family to a great Christmas vacation.The real strength of both \"Vacation\" and \"Christmas Vacation\" is that, at its heart, we see the Clark truly wanting the best for his family, and though the Griswolds are long suffering, ultimately they know the meaning of family unity and togetherness.  Hughes is a sentimentalist, and as both this film and \"Home Alone\" show, like Dickens' Ebeneezer Scrooge, he knows Christmas and keeps it well.As this is more of an adult comedy under the National Lampoon moniker, \"Christmas Vacation\" does feature some racier elements.  While there is no nudity like the first two films, there are numerous profanities scattered throughout, including the infamous \"We're gonna press on, and we're gonna have the hap, hap, happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap-danced with Danny f---ing Kaye!\"  Audrey also tells her mother she has nightmares about what Rusty does alone in his bed at night when she is not lying in bed next to him (referring to masturbation).  When Eddie arrives, he talks to Clark about how big the dog's testicles are, and says he has some \"Mississippi Leg Hound\".  Eddie tells Clark that if the dog begins humping his leg, he should allow the dog to continue until climax and then clean off his jeans from the dog's . . . sex cells.Also continuing a character thread from the first film, we see that Clark not only flirts with a store clerk he meets early on in the film, but has an elaborate fantasy regarding the clerk Mary naked in a swimming pool midway through.  The film shows Mary getting out of the pool in a head and neck shot, but before her breasts are seen Ruby Sue, Eddie's daughter, comes in and interrupts Clark's fantasy.  There is also an extended shot of Eddie dropping raw sewage into Clark's sceptic system.The film opens with Clark, with family in tow, going out to pick out a Christmas tree.  One notable mention is this opening sequence mark's the film's ONLY reference to Jesus Christ, the true reason for the season.  There are no nativity scenes or other religious referneces, etc, which is somewhat strange given the overtly religious nature of the origin for Christmas.  Even Kevin McCallister in \"Home Alone\" (another John Hughes movie, made a year after \"Christmas Vacation\") hides in a nativity scene and goes to church.  Clark and his family memorably have an almost horrible wreck with some rednecks and gets lodged under a semi, before taking out a the Christmas lot sign.  Given Clark's driving record, he most have some truly expensive auto-insurance policies.  Upon arrival, they wander off into the woods, where Clark finds an enormous tree which he is adamant is the Griswold Family Christmas Tree!  Bringing no saw, Clark uproots the tree and drives the tree home, roots and all, strapped to his family truckster from the first film.The first half of the film sets up Clark and Ellen preparing for Christmas and the arrival of the in-laws.  So many of us can relate to those awkward family gatherings, and the Griswolds are no exceptions.  Roger Ebert in his review from 1989 critized the movie for the way Hughes handles the inlaws, saying they functioned more as a homogenous unit and serve as a backdrop to Chevy Chase's antics, much like the majority of the dwarves blending seamlessly into the background in Tolkien's \"The Hobbit\".  The in-laws never really distinguish themselves or make themselves notable in the script.I disagree rather strongly with this assessment.  While the main focus is indeed on Chase, there are many moments involving the in-laws that are not only quite funny but often quite realistic.  Hughes writes with an economy befitting an hour and a half comedy; he gets every bit that he can from both sets of grandparents and Uncle Lewis and Aunt Bethany (played by Mae Questral in her last film appearance, and the voice of Betty Boop).  Alas, as I have grown older I can truly relate to the rather sad state elderly people get into when they begin to experience dementia, Alzheimer's, and senility.Although the script is already crowded with these extra characters, one notable omission is the lack of any children, aunts and uncles.  As far as we know, Beverly and Clark were only children and Rusty and Audrey have no first cousins.  I think there could have been some memorable interactions had Hughes brought in some first cousins.Thoughout the first half, the in-laws arrive, Clark gets locked in the attic (and watches some old home movies, before being quite abruptly interrupted in a very funny, very painful moment), and struggles with the art of exterior illumination.  He meets an attractive sales clerk at the mall and tries to make himself visible to his boss in a good way, all the while failing miserably.  Another memorable line is when the parents arrive, Clark says \"Well I'm gonna park the cars and get the luggage, and well, I'll be outside for the season.\"  I've known a few times when people (my father in particular) escape into other areas (outside, other parts of the house), to escape the chaos of the Christmas gatherings.In a memorable ensemble scene when Clark and Ellen finally get the thousands upon thousands of Christmas lights finally working, Clark hugs each family member and then moves on to Cousin Eddie, hoping the Christmas lights \"adds\" to Eddie and Katherine's festive cheer and enjoyment of the holiday season.  He then promptly realises that Eddie and Katherine are standing in his front yard and goes into shock.Randy Quaid deftly plays Cousin Eddie, the ultimate trailer-trash cousin.  Like Chevy Chase to Clark W. Griswold, Randy Quaid was tailor made for this role.  Having been out of work for seven years (he's holding out for a management position, Katherine informs Ellen), they have lost their farm from the first movie and are now living in an RV.  Katherine and Eddie had four children (and she was pregnant with a fifth) in the first movie.  Hughes promptly dispenses with the extra children and there are only two children present, Rocky and Ruby Sue, as Eddie explains the older ones are working in a carnival.  I also love when Clark says he and Ellen will be Eddie's children some Christmas presents (as Eddie doesn't have any presents for his children due to financial hardships), and Eddie says he wants Clark to buy himself a really nice present for being so generous.  Cracks me up!  The sled sequence is also quite funny.Cousin Eddie promptly interjects life into the second half of the movie.  While the first half leading up to Cousin Eddie's arrival are quite funny, Randy Quaid almost steals the show.  He just nails his performance wonderfully.  Redneck, broke, and just overall idiotic, Randy was born to play this role.  I've always been rather creeped out when Eddie tells Rusty \"Come on, let's go find your sister.\"  Given that we know he french kisses his daughter from the first movie, the whole exchange just has a very creepy undercurrent.The squirrel scene is quite funny too.  Watching the movie on TV can lead to interesting cuts.  One of my favorites is when Clark's father is talking to Clark, and he asks his dad how his dad managed to make it through the holidays.  His father's answer: \"I had a lot of help from Jack Daniels\", at which they both laugh.  I've seen several cuts where they simply elimiate that last part \"from Jack Daniels\", completely ruining the joke.  Clark's reading of the \"Twas the Night Before Christmas\" (barely begun and unfinished as the performance is) is another great moment.The main driving plot device that sets up the climax of the film is Clark has put down money for a new swimming pool but does not have the money to pay for the pool.  He is relying on his bonus to cover the costs.  As he has worked for his company for seventeen years and every one of those years he has gotten a bonus ensures that he has certainity [is certain] he will likewise get a bonus this year.  Ultimately we discover there is no forth-coming monetary bonus and is instead enrolled in a Jelly of the Month Club, which Eddie promptly points out is a gift that keeps giving the whole year through.Clark then memorably goes into probably the best single moment in the entire Vacation franchise, railing against his boss and how he wants him brought to Clark's house so he can tell his boss how worthless he is.  In a nod to the original, still unseen ending to \"Vacation\", where Clark kidnaps Roy Wally at his house, Cousin Eddie kidnaps Clark's boss Frank Shirley and brings him to Clark's residence.  A swat team promptly goes into rescue Frank Shirley and just like \"Vacation\", Shirley decides not to press charges and reinstates Clark's bonus, as well as the other employees' bonus.  In the end, Clark looks at the camera and says \"I did it\", showing he was successful in his aims at having a great Christmas after allOverall, a fantastic Christmas movie.  For those concerned with the profanity then watch the movie on one of the regular cable TV channels.  This is Hughes at his best.  If I had to choose between this and \"Vacation\", I'd give a (very, very) slight edge to \"Vacation\", but both are easily the best the Vacation franchise have to offer!\n",
      "EACH YEAR THIS IS A MUST SEE. THE WHOLE FAMILY TALKS ABOUT THIS WELL BRFORE THE HOLIDAY SEASON STARTS. ENJOY!\n",
      "It's funny every time we watch it. We watch it at Christmas each year. Its worth buy to have in your collection.\n",
      "Although I do love this movie and watch it every year I only rated it four stars as after the 27th time the jokes can become kind of old since you see them coming. Although I am saying this it does not in anyway mean that you should not watch this movie as it is still a great movie that you must at least watch once before you die or your movie watching life can not be considered complete.\n",
      "I would recommend this classic slapstick comedy to anyone, from the over the top decorating to the family visiting...everything provides a good laugh!\n",
      "We love this movie and recommend it to all young and old. We still laugh very hard when we watch it. I just bought one for my daughter and her husband so they too can make it their Christmas tradition. Please watch it and you too will make it your Christmas tradition.\n",
      "This one goes right along with \"A Christmas Story\" as far as Christmas movies go. Not much else needs to be said.\n",
      "Great movie, one of Chevy's classics out of the National Lampoon series.  A Christmas staple to be played over and over.\n",
      "But only if you want to laugh your tail feathers off... typical over the top humor on Chevy Chases part makes this a fun movie to watch. Enjoy.\n",
      "Every year we watch this as a family and it never gets old.  It is a classic Christmas movie.  My son repeats lines from the movie all year long.\n",
      "This is one of the most funniest movies to date. If you want to laugh, you have to see this movie.\n",
      "This is a must have for anybody with a collection of Christmas movies. This is by far my favorite Christmas movie ever!\n",
      "This movie is Hilarious.  I've watched it since it was made in \"1986\".  I watch it every Christmas & laugh.  It's become such a \"Classic\".  It's a Family tradition of sorts now in Our house ;)\n",
      "Christmas Vacation is one of my favorite Christmas movies.This movie is hilarious. The Blu-Ray version is not as clear as a movie filmed in hd but it is clearer that sd.\n",
      "THANKSGIVING TRADITION! We have gone thru several tapes and DVDs.Was THRILLED to find our Thanksgiving Traditional Movie on blu ray!\n",
      "Classic film, over the top plot, clever humour. If you like a film that isn't all that realistic but amplifies real life for onscreen purposes than this is a great choice.\n",
      "One of Chevy's best -- and my personal favorite of the Vacation series. Clark Griswold is at his most well-intentioned but dim-witted best in this one. This movie has lots of strong gags throughout. Just when you think the story is about to lose steam, Randy Quaid shows up -- and the comedy goes to a whole new level. (My favorite scene is still the \"sled\" ride into traffic). Top notch supporting work from Beverly D'Angelo, and especially William Hickey and Mae Questel (as the great-grandparents).This DVD was made back in the days when \"extras\" meant trailers, and maybe some production notes. This is also a full-screen prsentation which is bad news for those of us who care about such things. Hopefully a \"Special Edition\" of this Christmas classic will be released with commentary from the stars, a widescreen picture and any out-takes that might possibly exist.\n",
      "Every year this movie is a must. I even watch it the whole year !No other xmas movie even comes close to this one.My whole family quotes phrases from the movie year round. \"The little lights are not twinkling\", \"That their is an RV\", \"If it's not too much trouble get something \"Real\" nice for yourself\", \"If your not doing anything constructive\" the list keeps going on. We love itTOP NOTCH RATING !!\n",
      "I love The Ref (as my fav Christmas flick), but it's not suited for ALL viewers so this is THE movie for the Christmas collection!\n",
      "This would be a 5-star if the mug was full-size so one could use it.  Additionally, the tin arrived dented on the side near the bottom, so impossible to pop out.  I purchased for a birthday gift, and don't have time to return and wait for a replacement.  The seller waited until the last possible minute to actually ship the item so it arrived on the last day of estimated delivery.  Shipping was disappointing for such a small package.  Amazon is usually much faster.\n",
      "Yep, watch it every Christmas season, and usually a time or two during the year. This is a must own!\n",
      "An annual family tradition in our house! Can't have too many copies of this gem. Chevy Chase is hilarious. Watching this makes for huge hilarity every year at our house. Spoofs every holiday tradition!\n",
      "No surprises here, just a great movie in DVD format with a case just like in the picture.  I'm happy to own it!\n",
      "This is the one Christmas movie that keeps on giving.  We watch it a couple of times every Holiday Season, and it never gets old.  Now on Blu Ray, the film looks pretty darned good as well.\n",
      "We watched this movie several times during the holidays. We never get tired of it and glad to own it finally!\n",
      "Christmas without Christmas Vacation isn't Christmas at all! Our best movie ever. We adore it and know every line probably!\n",
      "I've watched this movie at least 3 times every Christmas season since 1989. It is not only hilarious, but also relates to almost every 'normal' family and extended family I know. Brilliant writing and great cast. Never tire of watching this and finally realized I didn't own it yet on DVD, soI bought it for myself as a Christmas gift. As much as I love this movie, there are a few things I could do without ie. one F bomb, main happily married male character flirting suggestively with younger woman, then fantasizing about her losing her bathing suit in pool and a few other suggestive things that weren't needed.  This movie would be funnier without those things.\n",
      "Very funny Christmas Movie with Chevy Chase!! We always watch this movie many times during the holiday season. It's all about family fun at the holidays.\n",
      "We watch this year-round!  Thanks Amazon for carrying DVD's that aren't often easy to find elsewhere. If you have never watched this comedy, it's a must-see!\n",
      "We watched this movie on a holiday afternoon and it was enjoyed by all. There were no children though, so I can't speak for that age group.\n",
      "My family and I enjoy watching everything go wrong in this wonderful holiday classic. Would recommend to all who enjoy a good movie.\n",
      "This movie was great! It was just a funny movie and I think anybody that watches it would get a good laugh.\n",
      "The Griswold's are back trying to celebrate the perfect Christmas but forces, as always, are against them...or perhaps Clark's expectations are just too high.The acting is appropriate and hilarious.  The characters are farcical and well acted.  Dialogue and situations are at times bizarre yet fitting for the Griswolds.Overall, a fun movie!\n",
      "Along with It's a Wonderful Life, this is a must see Christmas film every year. This one will have you laughing every few mintues or so and will get you in the Christmas spirit for sure. So cuddle around the fire and enjoy this classic during the holiday season.\n",
      "It's not Christmas until you've watched this classic Christmas movie! Very funny and makes you feel a little better about your own crazy family during the holidays!\n",
      "Wonderful and laughed as much as  when I first saw it. It is a funny film. A holiday classic.....Watch it.\n",
      "This movie is a time honored Christmas classic that goes with cookies egg nog apple pie and gift wrap it cannot be Christmas without it.\n",
      "One of the funniest Christmas Classics.  Christmas vacation highlights extended dysfunction at it's best. One of Chevy Chases' best movies.  Definely not for the young ones though as this film includes a lot of a adult humor.\n",
      "This has become my favorite movie to get in the holiday spirit. Chevy Chase and the gang remind us that things will go wrong, there will be people around us we might not have chosen to spend our time with, but in the end, it all works out, and it's a magical time.\n",
      "One of the best movies ever. I've seen this a movie about a million times but as soon as I saw this set I had to buy it.\n",
      "The film that inspired a whole generation of exterior illuminators! Subsequent to the release of this film, houses soon began Christmas-light makeovers, which I think really adds to the atmosphere of the season! Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are superb in this John Hughes classic Christmas comedy - as is Randy Quaid. Clark W Griswold Jnr is anxious to have the 'perfect' old fashioned, fun, family Chritmas. But, as usual, nothing goes according to plan: Getting stuck under a truck in the opening minutes... becoming psychotic over the failing of the thousands of lights he's added to the building... ruining the Christmas of Tod and Margo (their yuppie, bourgesois next door neighbours)...Eddie (Quaid) kidnapping Clark's boss because Clark didn't recieve his bonus cheque, needed to pay for a swimming pool...a storm sewer exploding (and the poor cat!)...the tree getting burnt...etc...Leading to the house teetering on 'the threshold of Hell'! There are many great moments in this movie. My personal favourite is when he takes Eddie and the kids sledging: a silicone-based kitchen lubricant Clark's company invented is smeared onto his sledge, propelling him like a rocket! The scenery is so Christmassy here. I have a selection of Christmas movies I stack around the video at this time of year. Christmas Vacation takes prime position. I have seen it *so* many times yet I am still not bored with it. Note: There is mild bad language in the PG version, but for those with younger children, some versions have worse. I really don't know why Hughes had to do this; this film could be accessible to all, as with Miracle On 34th Street (Hughes' remake). As is usual with John Hughes, those typical huge mansions (as with Home Alone, Ferris Bueller and Uncle Buck) feature. The photography is very Christmassy and it just might get you in the mood... The DVD has the trailer (including the other Vacation trailers), different language options, production notes etc... I am glad to have found a site that sells those reindeer egg nog glasses too!\n",
      "Christmas classic. My family and I make watching this movie a tradition each year. Clark W. Griswold and cousin Eddie are great.\n",
      "Perfect quality with no playback issues at all! Quick start up and smooth play through out the whole movie. Thanks!\n",
      "A must see every year. Family fave for years to come. Funny and warm. Will always be a tradition in my home.\n",
      "We rented this movie to watch on Christmas Eve.  Our youngest is 13 years old.  We enjoyed it.  There is a topless scene that caught us by surprise.\n",
      "Our whole family watched this movie on Christmas Eve. This will continue to be a family tradition each year. This movie is super funny!\n",
      "You don't have to wait until December to enjoy this film. Every time I watch this movie I find something else to appreciate - from the creative writing to exaggerate the sentimental traditions, to the hysterical performances of the entire cast. This is Chevy at his best. But the icing on the cake is Randy Quaids genius interpretation of that embarrassing relative we want to disclaim. Thanks for a timeless comedy classic.\n",
      "Great fun family movie. Highly recommend for your collection! Can watch it again and again and it is still funny.\n",
      "Very funny. Bought this one for one of the grandchildren. I watch this movie easy Christmas season and never fail to get some good laughs. My husband is not much of a Chevy Chase fan but really enjoys this movie and laughs more than I do. A great all around clean, no swearing, no sexual innuendos family oriented movie.\n",
      "I really enjoyed watching this movie because it is such a funny movie to watch. I had to get it to go along with the rest of the movies. Overall it is a great movie!\n",
      "Festive mayhem in this comedy about the Griswald family Christmas. Clark Griswald (Chevy Chase) is determined his family are going to enjoy a traditional family Christmas whether they want to or not. In true 'National Lampoon' style, all does not go to plan with the usual hilarious results.From choosing the tree (which would fit better in Trafalgar Square!) to covering the entire house in fairy lights, and subsequently blowing the whole neighbourhoods lights, Clark manages to cause mayhem with whatever he touches.Things go from bad to worse when his uninvited slob of a cousin (Randy Quaid) arrives with his hillbilly family and mangy dog.This is great fun for all ages and a 'must watch' during the Christmas holidays.\n",
      "The film has held up over the yearsStill funnyTwo actors who had smaller roles Julia Louis-Dreyfus & Johnny Galecki went on to huge TV fameDifference in picture none between DVD & blu rayNow, here is what I am disappointed about with this package.OK, the Vacation films have been released multiple times on VHS, laser, DVD & now blu ray.The product packing does NOT mention Johnny Galecki in it with \"The Big Bang Theory\" a top 5 show BUT it mentions Juliette Lewis who has not done a thing in years & her success was in this film & in the 1990'sSame commentary used on other releases  DisappointingIf you are a fan of the film & want this on blu ray then buy it  The extras, unless you do NOT have a previous release of the film you will be just as disappointed as I am\n",
      "This is one you have to watch every year.  Timless classic!\n",
      "A classic holiday feel-good comedy everyone can enjoy. Constantly moving and upbeat, Chevy and cast keep the laughter at peak with some slapstick and witty comical phrasing.\n",
      "I watch this movie every year.  My family had a Christmas Vacation partyA fun movie to watch each year\n",
      "I bought a copy of this for a second home I was spending time at during the holiday season.  This is my favorite Christmas holiday comedy movie.  I laugh still every time I see this and I have probably seen this 20 some times or better.  I think I have the dialogue down by heart.  It came quickly and had it in time for the trip south....\n",
      "\"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\" is one of the funniest Christmas movies out there. You can help but sit there and wonder how all of these crazy things happen to the Griswald Family, but whatever it is, I'm sure we the audience are very grateful.This movie you cannot tire of. It keeps you rolling time after time and is great to watch all year-round, not just at Christmas!\n",
      "This never gets old and I can watch it over and over each and every year.  Makes our whole family laugh!\n",
      "CHRISTMAS VACATION IS THE STORY OF THE GRISWOLD FAMILY. HIS PARENTS AND HER PARENTS ARE GETTING HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS AND IN THE MEAN TIME HE (CHEVY CHASE) IS GETTING THE HOME READY FOR XMAS PUTTING OR BETTER YET SAY TRYING TO PUT THE HOLIDAY LIGHTS ON.HOPPING THE LIGHTS TURNS ON WHEN HE IS READY TO PUT THE PLUG ON, ONLY TO FIND THAT THEY DONT WORK AND THAT IS WHERE THE WHOLE SH....TS HITS THE FAN. WHILE THEIR NEIGHBORS ARE HATING HIM FOR BRINGING OVER THE BIGGEST TREE IN THE HISTORY, THEY CAN NOT STAND THE MOMENT WHEN THE LIGHTS REALLY GOES ON FULL SPEED...THERE IS SO MUCH I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE, BUT I TELL YOU THIS, WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE IT WAS BACK IN 1990. A VERY LOW PERIOD IN MY LIFE AND I REMEMBER HOW IT MADE ME FEEL. IT BROUGHT BACK A LITTLE BIT OF HOPE AND PROMISE MY SELF I WOULD WATCH THIS FILM EVERY XMAS WITH MY FAMILY.AND I HAVE DONE SO, FOR THE LAST 15 YRS I TAKE OUT THIS FILM, PREPARE THE FAMILY AND WE SIT FOR 2 HRS AND HAVE A GOOD LAUGH. ONLY ONCE A YR I WATCH THIS MOVIE AND EVEN THOUGH FOR THE LAST 15 YRS I HAVE WATCH IT 15 TIMES I DONT CARE I WANT TO SEE IT 15 MORE...\n",
      "No doubt Chevy hits the mark... I can watch this movie everyday and still laugh. I a holiday and everyday standard.\n",
      "I don't think that this movie will ever take the place of The christmas Story but it is still an enjoyable movie.All Clark Griswold wants is a nice family christmas..with a presents and family with a declious christms dinner and just a perfect family get together..and he gets it right....come on were talking about clark griswold and the Griswold clan not the brady bunch. Everything that could go wrong does and i mean everything. this movie is a family movie that will make you bust out laughing....it also makes you hope that your family get together won't go as bad as the griswolds.\n",
      "Watching this movie has become a family Christmas tradition as we always watch this movie. Every year like clockwork. We've even been known to watch it in July when it's so hot all we want to do is think about Christmas and cooler weather ahead.The characters are so true-to-life (albeit not exactly like everyone in your family) they will remind you of your crazy aunt and your nutty uncle. It will also bring home the reminder of neighbors who somehow try to out do one another in celebrating the Christmas spirit.The only drawback to this movie is some adult scenes and language that is better suited for mature audiences. I would not recommend watching this movie with young children but older teens would probably understand the adult humor.Highly recommend.\n",
      "This is a truly funny and great movie...except for the language.  I don't know why they have to put in all the x rated words because this is a great movie without all the cussing.\n",
      "Another tradition of ours is to watch this film every Christmas.  It just isn't Christmas without this movie!  Buy it!\n",
      "I have watched this movie every Christmas season for many years.  Each year I watch it, I laugh harder than I did the year before.  It never fails to delight me!\n",
      "This is at least the third copy of this movie that I have purchased and yes, I know all the lines. It is the funniest and the best Christmas movie out. It is also the first movie that gets watched in the summer when we are having 90 degree weather.\n",
      "It's a tradition for my friends and I to watch this every holiday season! Christmas wouldn't be the same without it.\n",
      "This movie is great on Blu-ray.  I absolutely love this movie.  It is hilarious and gets funnier each time I watch it.  Everyone laughs when watching it.\n",
      "This is the all time FUNNIEST movie.  I can watch it over and over and still laugh like mad at it.\n",
      "Have watched Christmas Vacation since 1985?, it is not Christmas without it. Chevy Chase and the cast are the best.  Great laughs each year.  It never, never, never gets old. My family sets a date each year and we watch it together even though we are miles apart, and of course after the movie talk about it via the computer and smart phones.  How many movies can bring a family together like that.  LOVE IT!\n",
      "This movie is an all time classic and will never grow old.  We purchased to show to the younger generation in our family and they love it also.\n",
      "My family watches this movie several times a year at Christmas time. Clark Grizwold's bumbling attempt to create the ultimate family Christmas just never seems to the way he planned.\n",
      "Didn't remember that it had so many bad words in it. Watched with my grandsons. A few funny parts in it.\n",
      "This movie is a holiday tradition for our family. Fun with laugh out loud moments, it is must have for Chevy Chase fans or anyone who appreciates family chaos!\n",
      "some adult language at the end if you are watching with children. we have turned it into a tradition to watch it Christmas week.\n",
      "A classic holiday movie that I love to watch every year around the holiday season.  Recommend who wants to watch a hilarious throw back Christmas movie.\n",
      "Funny sometimes it had to reload a few times, because it was slow. Watch a movie again but hope it's not slow.\n",
      "I watch all the wonderful and timeless Christmas classics --  It's A Wonderful Life (my favorite of all),  Miracle on 34th Street ( the original, NOT the remake),  but then I need a comedic touch so I turn to Chevy Chase in Christmas Vacation.  Always a fun romp no matter how many times I've seen it!\n",
      "I love this movie. I watch it every Christmas and laugh without fail every time. So funny and full of adult family fun.\n",
      "This is one of the best Christmas movies ever. It arrived ahead of schedule there for we were able to enjoy it over the holiday. Great price for a blu-ray!!\n",
      "The sequel to Vacation is so much better! The complications and disappointments of trying to create a \"Currier and Ives\" Christmas are comically portrayed. Everyone can relate to some aspect of Clark's attempt at having a true family holiday. Don't forget the fashion lesson taught us by Cousin Eddie-never wear a dickey with a white sweater!A thoroughly enjoyable movie to watch over and over again, not just at Christmas!\n",
      "From the moment I first watched this movie, many years ago, I laughed non stop. It has become a holiday tradition at our house to watch this movie.

      "Its an older film, but to me, the older ones are the best....I like this film I had the VHS version but when my VCR stopped rewinding, I decided it was time for the CD.  Great film :)\n",
      "One of the few movies I can watch over and over again.  Bought the blurry version for a great price!\n",
      "Hysterical film about Christmas and the relatives, classic performances by all involved.  Maybe the best of the Vacation movies, I also like the one in Las Vegas.\n",
      "I'm just going to say it: this is the best Christmas movie ever made.  I've seen it countless times over the years, and I still laugh like it's the first time EVERY TIME! It just isn't Christmas without the Griswolds.\n",

      "We always seem to miss Christmas Vacation when it is on TV, it's a classic Christmas movie, so we added it to our dvd library.  We didn't need the rest of the stuff in the box, but would make a great gift.\n",
      "This is one of the best Christmas films I've ever seen.  It's hilarious from the word go.  A must see!\n",

      "We usually play this at least twice every Christmas season as do many people we know.It is the best!\n",
      "So funny it will make your gut and facial muscles hurt! In the tradition of the other NL vacation movies, Chevy Chase is on a mission to create the BEST Griswold holiday ever! From stapling himself to the roof, riding on the worlds fastest sled, and putting a Christmas tree through his humbug-neighbors window - this movie will keep you laughing all the way through! A great movie to watch to get into the holiday spirit & shake off those Christmas frustrations ... and it's funny enough to watch even if it's June!!!\n",

      "Well this was a somewhat classic in itself.Other than the story line getting a bit rough at times,this is a very funny movie to watch,the cut version on tv is good,but to get the full feel for this film the dvd version is very funny,I don't think any of the younger teens would say it's bad for they have herd many of these words before,and if you think they haven't,well you better wake up and smell the coffee.This has got to be the best movie Chevy Chase has stared in,and he has been in many movies,but this one is just to much,really very well made,and very funny,this film has been around for some time ,but still is a must watch,we still put this one on in the winter time around XMAS,a very good laugh,a very good  dvd collection to add.\n",

The lingerie counter scene - Hilarious!  The squirrel in the Christmas tree - Classic! I could go on and on! I give it a huge 2 thumbs up!  Every cast member delivers an A+!  Great!  Great!  Great!  For those sensitive to language, there is some bad language in various spots of the movie but all in all it's one of my favorites!\n",

      "My favorite Christmas oriented comedy, period.Some folks have a Christmas tradition of food. I have a tradition of watching this.\n",
      "Excelent Movie for those days and for enjoying with family, refreshing, funny, pop-corn movie. Chevy Chase is fantastic and very classic scenes\n",
      "This movie is a great depiction of a good ol' family Christmas.If you have random relatives, annoying in-laws, neighbors that drive you insane, and a cheap-ass boss this movie is perfect for you.This movie is a holiday staple at my place.I can watch this movie over and over and still laugh.\n",
      "stating the obvious here, but this is the best of the \"vacation\" series\".definitely a Christmas classic and worth having in the video library to break out for the holidays.\n",
      "Best christmas movie ever ,Aside from any movies about baby jesus! And now on bluerayMaas pero!o ... O. Christmas is for kids\n",
      "Makes me laugh every time I see it!Nostalgic, Warm.Did not fail to deliver!  Good family film to watch.\n",
      "this is the funniest Christmas moving ever made.  I laugh every time I watch it. I moved recently and had to leave my DVD version of this with a relative.  I was so happy amazon had it available fir streaming.  great quality I love it and you will also\n",
      "This movie is a classic.  I have watched Christmas Vacation every year for as long as I can remember.  Chevy Chase and the rest of the cast give a hilarious performance that makes this the best movie in the Vacation series.  Everyone can relate to this movie in some capacity as it shows the story of the Griswold Family Christmas.  You might even start to compare some of your own relatives and neighbors to members of the Griswold family.  This film is a must have for every holiday season.\n",
      "Hands down the funniest Christmas movie of all-time! You've just got to pity poor Clark Griswald (Chevy Chase) who tries his darndest to host a \"fun-filled family Christmas\" only to be victimized by every disaster imaginable. Of course, it's all done for laughs and quite frankly, nearly every scene in \"Christmas Vacation\" rates very high on the Laugh-O-Meter! This film makes light of the commercialism of Christmas -- be it the search for the perfect tree, waiting for that big year-end bonus at work, or the stress of shopping -- and twists it into a brilliant satire to which everyone can relate. But most of all, this is a movie about family, or more specifically, the family members we only see on \"special\" occasions. And my goodness, what a motley bunch the Griswalds are! In fact, Randy Quaid as the pea-brained, red-neck Cousin Eddie nearly steals the movie. Quaid doesn't merely light up the screen, he practically BLOWS it up every single second he is on camera. Everything about Eddie-- from his sauve selection of leisure suits to his filthy \"tenament on wheels\"-- is funny beyond imagination. The dialogue between Clark (the straight man) and Eddie is pure comic genius. Eddie, however, is merely a fool among many in \"Christmas Vacation\". Everyone can relate to the fighting in-laws, the cheapskate boss, and the senile Aunt Bethany and Uncle Louis as they all wreak havoc on what should be the best time of the year. Plain and simple, \"Christmas Vacation\" is such a hoot because we all share a bit of Clark Griswald's romantic vision of a perfect holiday. And most of us, not unlike Clark, experience a complete meltdown once the shopping begins and the relatives arrive. Around our home, we watch this movie at least 5 times every year during the Holiday Season. \"Christmas Vacation\" is the perfect cure for the Holiday Blues. An absolute comedy classic!\n",
      "SO FUNNY AND CAN WATCH IT EVERY YR OVER AND OVER.  Great entertainment for guests, too.  It's a classic movie.\n",
      "I received this product promptly and in great condition.  I gave this dvd to my sister and she has already watched it and enjoyed it again.  She has it on VHS but wanted a dvd copy.\n",
      "I want to buy a copy of this wonderful film but it isn't available in the UK and the US format isn't compatible with our European video players.  Please will someone produce a copy that I can play over here!\n",
      "We have  had a copy for several years but out copy got damaged. We watch this each year sometime during the season.\n",
      "very happy with purchase, fast service, my family has watched this movie several times, and enjoy each time.\n",
      "Love it......Always fun to watch just before the holidays. Love the family dynamics that take place even with all their dysfunctions.\n",
      "It's just a very , clean funny movie thats rather true to the way it is when getting ready for Christmas...............\n",
      "this  show will lift your spirit and make your day, very funny ,  will make your day, nothing like agood laugh\n",
      "This is one of the funniest Christmas movies I've ever seen. I have been watching this movie since it first came out. It is a Christmas tradition.\n",
      "Such a funny movie! Quality was great and joint eruption streaming to the computer! Would definitely recommend watching this anytime!\n",
      "a classic, i've seen it a million times and i still laugh my head off.  i think we can all relate and that is what makes it so fun and so forever...\n",
      "This is the BEST National Lampoon movie ever made of the \"Vacation\" series. Hilarious and full of sight gags with the Griswald family in their holiday adventures!  It definitely laugh out loud funny for everyone! By the way just be glad this doesn't happen to you! Enjoy!\n",
      "One of the all time greatest!!!! Watch it at least once a year at Christmas.  Goya set of moose glasses last year.\n",
      "One of the best movies ever-----they just don't make them like that any more! It's one of our christams traditions, we always watch it before Christmas. How can you not love Chevy Chase?\n",
      "One of the funniest Christmas movies ever made. It is one I have watched over and over anytime it was on cable. Now I have my own copy to watch whenever I feel like it. No matter how many time I watch it I find myself laughing out loud. Thank you Amazon.\n",
      "I love the National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (Special Edition) DVD. It has the Dog named Snot. It has the cat eating up the christmas tree light bulbs up and getting shocked to death after Clark plugged the lights back into the wall.\n",
      "With businesses cutting back and making employees do more, this movie is still relevant.  Because of the nature of today's businesses, workers who had once taken perks for granted, must now realize what once was isn't anymore.  On the other hand, businesses must realize workers do expect the past to be an indicator of the future.  What is great about this movie is how it can poke fun at both sides of the issue.  If you like this movie, then Summer Vacation will keep you laughing too.  Try Officespace if you would like to see another hilarious  twist on business and employee relationship.\n",
      "This is the pinnacle of the Vacation series.  All of the improbable situations seem so probable in this well-written, well-acted farce that you almost believe it could happen to you.\n",
      "Christmas Vacation is by far the best christmas film ever made!Its funny,it has great characters , and still manages to keep that christmas vibe alive throughout the film.As the title suggests , it wouldnt be xmas without this movie. As soon as November approaches each year christmas vacation is brought out from the back of the piles of videos and dvds for its month or two of continuous viewing . What can i say .Its simply a great movie that everyone should own. It has a great cast ,lets not forget Randy Quaid as uncle Eddie.I first saw this film when i was quite young and have loved it since then. Its simply a must buy . Go out and get it now! (Dvd available)\n",
      "This is a classic that I had on VHS and wanted it on DVD for annual Christmas viewing.\n",
      "I will never go a christmas without watching this movie, and it nice to be able to do it without commercials.\n",
      "A must see every year.  I never tire of watching this funny movie. Every scene causes a laugh.  Chase never disappoints\n",
      "Best holiday movie around. We watch it every year. Tradition. It does have some profanity so it is a little rough for children.\n",
      "Good show, Me, My wife and my 9 year old loved it! We all laughed trough the entire movie. Great!\n",
      "one of the best christmas movies, also one of Chevy Chases best movies as well. very funny a must have chevy chase classic\n",
      "This is one of my favorite all time Christmas classic. It reminds me of my uncle Doyle let bust the power grid with as many lights as possible.\n",
      "Christmas Vacation movie meets expectations of a Christmas movie to be enjoyed with friends and family gatherings for many years.\n",
      "Classic...Was funny then and is just as funny now!  One of my favorite Christmas movies of all time!  If you haven't seen it, you're missin out.\n",
      "I love seeing this movie every Christmas holiday!  It depicts hiliarious family dynamics and all those crazy relatives that you really don't want to be around.\n",
      "Very good, exactly in the condition they said it would be.We watch this movie several times every Christmas,is a tradition at our house. Needed to update from VHS to DVD.\n",
      "and will continue to watch it. this is a classic. i mean, we all love 'a christmas story', but this is its predecessor. and every year, i laugh just as hard. simply the best.\n",
      "Awesome movie!  Will enjoy forever.  Every time I watch it there's something new I didn't notice before.  lol lol lol\n",
      "My favorite movie, and now i can watch it commercial free, when i went to buy in store it was sold out but received this quickly and now we can enjoy it all season\n",
      "This is a must watch at Christmas time, love the humor and it has become a classic to watch in my household around the holidays.\n",
      "Me and my boyfriend love this movie. Its a great movie to watch during the holiday season.  The playback was a little choppy though during most if not all of the movie.\n",
      "Christmas season must see! Grew up watching this as a family tradition every Christmas eve and/or Christmas day and will continue the tradition! Laugh out loud no matter how many times I have seen it, and if you havent seen it yet-buy because you will want to own it\n",
      "I have watched this movie probly over 100 times, and it's funnier every time I watch it! LOL 10+++++ Stars\n",
      "very funny classic movie for the family and friends.  I would recommend to others for a good holiday movie night\n",
      "This is a yearly watch for my family at the holidays. Every so often I come across someone that has not seen the film, but there are not many people who have missed this. In my opinion, a comedy classic and probably Chevy Chase's best comedy performance. Well written and produced, well acted, and funny from start to finish. A highly recommended movie for comedy fans. The Blu-ray does improve the picture over the original.\n",
      "What can I say...this movie has been the highlight of our annual \"B Family Dysfunctional Christmas Party.\" The only rules include:1.only junk food allowed to be eated,and2.only alcohol product to be consumed.We watch \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\" as well as \"Office Space\" as we tie one on (as a family of course).Highly recommended for portraying a typical North American Christmas full of overblown expectations and totally square yuppies who live next door.Thanks for a providing us with a Christmas ritual...\n",
      "Production quality is obviously mid-80s, but Chevy Chase is at his finest in this one ... absolute classic!!!  We've got a few residents where I live that \"Griswold\" their house at Christmastime.  :)\n",
      "This is another classic Christmas Movie. The comedy is outstanding. If you have had family Christmas gatherings like we have had, you will recognize family members in the cast.\n",
      "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation has become a holiday tradition in my home. As many times as I've seen this movie I still laugh. There's good old cousin Eddie and his clan, the in-laws, the house covered with lights, (that don't light), an exploding turkey, and of course the squirrel. Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid play off each other perfectly. Then there's the long-suffering ever-faithful Beverly D'Angelo, who relates as Chevy's wife identically as Marge Simpson relates to Homer. The only advantage to owning this movie on DVD is the durability factor. As other reviewer's have mentioned, the DVD picture quality is poor. Besides a grainy picture, the DVD contains no extras, unless you consider a movie trailer to be a special feature. I certainly do not consider a movie trailer a big deal. There will most likely be a \"Collector's Edition\" released some day that will boast a better picture and added features; seems to be a trend with some of these DVD's. Patience is truly a virtue. Happy Holidays!\n",
      "We have owned this on VHS for years but lost the VHS tape to our VCR. Finally bought the DVD back in the year of 2009 so we can continue watching it. I even buy the DVD to give to friends at my work and family members as Christmas gifts. They all love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith\n",
      "It shows all of our stereotypes in a way that we could not do today. We see it every year and some of the phrases have become of our vocabulary...I don't know Margo!\n",
      "We watch this every year at Christmas, but despite the rating, I wouldn't watch this with kids under 15.... treat at least as PG-13.\n",
      "If you haven't seen this movie you should. If you have it should be a tradition to watch it. If is funny and mostly family friendly. There are few curse words here and there, but noting unruly. It is a journey of a man and his pursuit of the perfect christmas, which well all know isn't possible. But what is does show is that the \"perfect\" Christmas is not a checklist of performed task and activities, but an ideal accomplished by spending time with family and appreciating the chaos that comes along with it. Enjoy\n",
      "LOVE it, would not be a Christmas holiday without, The entire family gathers to whtch, usually Christmas evening and it is a blast\n",
      "This movie vies with the original National Lampoon's Vacation as the best in the series.  Certainly this is a great addition to any comedy-lover's DVD collection.  It comes in the modern-style cardboard DVD-box, not a plastic one, but this is my only criticism.  The DVD plays very well and the movie is superb.  If you love great comedy films, buy this one now!!!!\n",
      "Still one of the funniest family Holiday comedy's, one which we watch  every year. The cast and the lines are classics.\n",
      "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation deserves to be a Christmas classic the same as White Christmas or It's a Wonderful Life.  It's simply hilarious and full of fun.  I could watch it over and over again.\n",
      "It's very funny and its an annual tradition that my family watches it every year!  My daughter can quote just about every line from it and it just makes me laugh out loud!!!\n",
      "it was quite humerous! a grrat family movie! nothing inappropriate, so the whole family can watch and enjoy! we will watch again!\n",
      "My wife wanted to watch this classic with the kids, so we watched on Amazon Prime.  Apparently we forgot just how bad the language was for a 8 & 10 yr old, just goes to show how good the censors are at making movies ready for prime time.  I don't recommend for young children.\n",
      "It's a classic. Funny as all get out. TRUE meaning of Christmas. Things don't matter. Family is where it's at.\n",
      "You either love it or hate it. I personnaly find it so funny and hysterical that it has been my favorite Christmas-holiday-movie since it was released. Clark and Eddie, how can you not love these guys?? Clark -the hopeless clums, and Eddie -the hopeless as adorable idiot (he is!). I've watched it again many times this Christmas as well sipping my wine in relaxed evenings after work with my girlfriend in my arms -cozy, hysterical, romantic and warm, adorable yes -National Lampoons' Christmas Vacation has become and is tradition over here in Norway. Chase was perfect for this role (these roles actually, no real \"vacations\" without him), the same goes, of course, for Randy Quaid. Superb comedians, the best!\n",
      "This was the funniest of all the chevy chase's movies about vacations. I give it 5 stars because of the all star cast and the great writing. Randy Quaid was so good in this movie-he played his part brillantly. I would recommend to anyone who wants a great christmas comedy to get this movie. You won't be sorry.\n",
      "This has been a yearly watch for my entire family since it came out. Just as funny now as it was the first time I saw it. When is the last time you met somebody that didn't use a quote from this movie during the holiday season?\n",
      "I LOVE this movie its a tradition to watch this at my aunts house on Christmas SO hilarious! Will reccomend to you And all my friends! Buy this movie you HAVE to!\n",
      "The third installment of the Vacation series finds the Griswold family traversing the perils of the Christmas holiday season.  This is Chevy Chase's best performance as Clark Griswold.  He perfectly mixes the goofiness of the character with a touch of sentimentality that all successful Christmas movies have.  Clark wants to have the perfect family Christmas and of course his carefully detailed plans go awry.  There are some hysterical scenes involving hanging Christmas lights on the house and shopping in a downtown Chicago department store.  The cast are all funny and the film is worth watching for Mr. Chase alone.\n",
      "I just love this movie and only watch it on Christmas eve.  It's a tradition started about 5 years ago.  I look forward to seeing this moving every year.  It doesn't feel like Christmas until I watch this movie!!\n",
      "Always funny every time I watch it.  Family fun movie... So many things remind me of my family... I think we have all been there!  :))\n",
      "I don't need to say much. If you haven't already seen this movie it's because you're either under the age of 5...or blind.\n",
      "Chevy chase is a riot  as an inept \"sad sack \" Every whichway he turns is a  laugh, as he bumbles through each scene.\n",
      "Love this movie!  It is filled with a humorous view of all-too-familiar events experienced during the holidays.  The characters are delightful.\n",
      "Entire family watches this movie every Christmas and repeats it word for word!  Laugh out loud every time!  Love it!\n",
      "I've never seen any of the National Lampoon's movie but my hubby & I collect Christmas movies because it's our favorite time of year. This was a really cute movie, we enjoyed it. Fast shipping, very good seller.\n",
      "Clark Griswold, played by Chevy Chase, has become the man we think of when we think of screwed up Christmases. What he wishes for his family, is that they have a good time.  And, what happens is one misadventure after another, all humorous.  He is able to  bring chaos with his adventures.. His wife, played by Bervely D'Angelo is loving and his children are used to him.Instead of the Griswolds going on vacation, their relatives come to visit them. What a crew,the in-laws hate each other, the crazy cousin is really crazy and has no money. The aunt and uncle have dementia and the aunt wraps the cat as a gift. Griswold covers the house with100,000 lights, and can't figure out how to turn it on. The neighbors are really going to move after this week, one thing after another occurs to them. The Griswolds try to provide a nice Christmas and all the relatives want one, but things just happen, continuously.This is a funny series, and most families seem to enjoy the absurdities of life with the Griswolds. We see a little bit of ourselves. It becomes a Christmas tradition.Recommended. prisrob 12-24-13\n",
      "Funny, light, for the young & old alike! Most people have or have experienced the types of characters in this family, which makes it relateable. Has become a Christmas movie tradition!\n",
      "I love this movie and have spent many a Christmas Eve watching it.  My old copy was worn out so I purchased this.\n",
      "What a great movie! It's so much fun and we watch it year after year! Finally had to buy my own copy.\n",
      "We always watch this movie after Thanksgiving. It's a tradition at our household. A planned out family Christmas that goes wrong but then turns  for the better.  Lots of laughs.\n",
      "Is there a better movie to define Christmas? Maybe but this one is my favorite. Must watch every season for good tidings!\n",
      "This is another childhood favorite that we always watch around Christmas! I love how everything goes wrong for the Griswold family on Christmas Eve. They have trouble with the Christmas tree because Clark forgot the chainsaw. He has all of his family members staying a few days in his house, cousin Eddie shows up, he doesn't get his Christmas bonus, the Christmas turkey blows, the tree catches on fire, and to make matters worse, Eddie kidnaps Clark's boss! If you love comedy, and Christmas, you'll love CHRISTMAS VACATION!!!\n",
      "This movie has become a Christmas family tradition.  Every year when putting up decorations, we put this movie in to watch.  The movie is a classic, and you'll love it if you like Chevy Chase movies.  The Blu-Ray is a good conversion.. looks good.. much better than VHS, but hard to tell if it's much better picture quality than a DVD.  Good thing about Blu Ray is that they are scratch resistant.. so even if the picture isn't noticeably better, it should last a lot longer!\n",
      "How much do you really need to write in a review of one of the best comedies of all time.  This movie is awesome...go buy it!\n",
      "We watch it every year and laugh at the same things and repeat the same lines over and over.  This one and the very first one are the best!\n",
      "Epitomizing the fun family Christmas, this movie will make you laugh and make you cringe all at the same time as you bear witness to the Griswold family trying to make it the perfect old fashioned family Christmas - an impossibility, we all know.\n",
      "I could watch this movie anytime of the year if you haven't seen it. It is worth watching. The cast is great, they make you laugh until you cry.\n",
      "Just a good old fashioned laugh at families stuck together for the holidays. Checy Chase at his best, lots of 80's outfits...just fun.\n",
      "now i have out family tradition on DVD, our VHS was wearing out and this is a Christmas classic! must have\n",
      "My family and I just love this movie! Our Christmas season wouldn't be complete if we couldn't watch Christmas vacation. Now that I bought the DVD we don't have to wait to see it on TV.\n",
      "My husband and I watch this movie several times each year. Its one of our favorites. We always get lots of laughs even though we have seen the movie over and over. Its priceless and there should have been another Holiday sequel to it. I recommend it highly as well as \"One Magic Christmas\" for a good family evenings entertainment.\n",
      "Love it.  The best of the \"Vacation\" movies.  I watch it every year and it hold up well.  Not so sure about the Blu-ray version yet, I need to watch it a few times to see if it is really worth the extra $$$\n",
      "This movie is a classic and one that our family must watch at least once each Christmas season, year after year. The clothing may be outdated but the rest of the movie stands the test of time. So funny and would highly recommend.\n",
      "This movie is a Christmas classic we have to watch it every year starting right after Halloween. We love Christmas at our house and start early.\n",
      "Arrived earlier than expected, my brother LOVED it, it was great to find it for such a reasonable price to complete his xmas gift (I also gave him N.L. Vacation & N.L. European Vacation). I will use amazon again.\n",
      "I bought this for my Grandson, as I enjoyed it many years ago....He loves it, and has watched it over and over.great service and the disc is perfect !\n",
      "It's on our list of must see Christmas movies that is watched every Christmas Season.  Never get tired of viewing this movie.\n",
      "Chevy Chase's dried humor is missed in the movies today. Funny movie you can watch any season of the year.\n",
      "The old DVD wore out so it was time for a new one. It wouldn't be the Holiday's without watching this movie.I believe this is the best one of the series....\n",
      "I watched Christmas Vacation and was amaze how clear it looks and heard sounds I never have on the DVD. I then watch the DVD version and it looked faded unlike the blu-ray just watch the scene when they find a Christmas tree at the beginning of the movie the spot light on the tree from heaven is so clear and bright it like they just made the movie.Also on the DVD you see black spots from old film at times through out the movie with the blu-ray you get none of that.If this is you favorite Christmas movie like it is for me then blu-ray is a must. If you are buying for extras then you are going to be disappointed. They did get a handful of stars to talk about the movie. However no deleted scenes etc. They put the trailer on it *wow like who cares*\n",
      "This movie has been a Christmas tradition in our family since it first came out. Our entire family along with the grandchildren still watch it every year.\n",
      "Hadn't seen this in years - some of Chevy Chase's best work.  I was sitting alone and laughing out loud.\n",
      "As good or better than the original which was an all time great. Would watch again for sure.  Now, where is the Tylenol!\n",
      "Arguably, this is the funniest of the Vacation movies. The true test of a good comedy is being able to still howl over the film years later, and \"Christmas Vacation\" more than does that for me. But this one works in reverse: Instead of the disaster-prone Griswolds travelling abroad to places like Europe or Wally World, they're anchored to the homefront as the calendar ticks off the days to Christmas. Chevy Chase is clearly in his element here reprising his role as well-intended but hopelessly klutzy matriarch Clark, who naturally, goes overboard with creating \"the perfect Christmas\". The reliably good Beverly D'Angelo is here too as Clark's supportive wife who gets her buttons pushed by annoying relatives & whining children as well as her doltish husband.The late John Hughes crams the script full of holiday satire & references, punched up with the trademark \"Lampoon\" slapstick & lowbrow humor. Granted, sometimes the humor tanks, but it's a nobler effort than the previous uneven \"European Vacation\". This one just defies you not to laugh your head off as the Griswolds' efforts to have \"the best Christmas\" turns into one long train wreck, which can tickle the funny bone of any \"Scrooge\".Look for familiar faces Juliette Lewis & Johnny Galecki (the latter currently on the hit sitcom \"The Big Bang Theory\") as the Griswold kids; a pre-Seinfeld Julia Louise-Dreyfuss as one-half of snobby yuppie neighbors suffering at the hands of Clark; and Doris Roberts, Diane Ladd & William Hickey as some of the troublesome relatives come to visit. But it's actually Randy Quaid's reprisal of goofy, freeloading hick cousin Eddie that steals every scene he's in.If you want a serious rendition of a Holiday classic, watch \"It's a Wonderful Life\"; if you want to laugh hard & often, then definitely watch this one!\n",
      "Hilarious movie; great to watch during Christmas season or any time of year. We watch it every year, and it's still funny every time we watch it!\n",
      "A very funny if somewhat painful depiction of a family Christmas celebration. It all goes wrong but the family unit presses on to celebrate.\n",
      "This will one day be a classic.  At least for me, it has made me laugh.  It has a bit of everything about the Christmas Holidays, in particular, the insanity of shopping.  Family is great and this movie shows that at this time of the year, we need to take the good with the bad (cousin Eddie).  I already had the movie but wanted to upgrade to blu-ray (the price was right) and give the other copy to my son, who happens to have the same warped sense of humor as his old man.  A fun family movie except near the end the big kahuna, the word Ralphie( A Christmas Story) escapes Clark Griswald mouth when he loses it.  Delivery was as promised.  The only negative I found is, with both copies, something was/is not right with the sound - I need to turn up my system to the top to hear.  Only DVD that I need to do that with.  Why???  Dunno.\n",
      "I just love this movie. It doesn't matter what time of year it is. I watch it all year long. Funny. Just love it I would give it ten stars if I could.\n",
      "We love, and look forward to our yearly viewing of Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  Excellent watching it in HD this year, instead of our older VHS.Love it.Thank you.\n",
      "We watch this movie every year and enjoy the antics Chevy and company portray.  Anyone that has family over for Christmas can relate to the relationships, preparations and disappointments.  The actors make even the worst situations fun to watch.\n",
      "Classic Chevy Chase !! Very funny especially when you catch the little things that happen in this movie.. Had to have it in my DVD library !!\n",
      "Hilarious movie that takes me back to my childhood! Great holiday movie. Packed with great holiday music and family scenes.\n",
      "I love this movie. Nothing more needed to be said about it. It is funny and should be a Christmas staple.\n",
      "I have watched this movie every Christmas since it came out on DVD.  This year I bought the Bluray when it was on sale.  The improvement in picture quality was noticeable but not great.  If you can pick it up on sale, I would say it is worth it.  As for the film itself, what can I say that has not already been said?  It is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen from cousin Eddie to Squirrel!, this movie never seems to get old.\n",
      "Great Christmas movie.  It's become a tradition to watch this every year along with Elf and A Christmas Story along with all the old classics.\n",
      "One of the funniest movies.  Great to watch at Christmas every year.  I don't usually purchase movies, but this is a classic.\n",
      "This movie is awesome (to me). I liked it so much I bought in on Blu Ray. I am not a techno-expert but I do think that some of the blu ray is not as clear as it should be, its kind of grainy. But the movie is a Christmas classic. I have laughed every year I have watched it. I am an adult so I am rating this as an adult movie. Its not for little kids because it does have a few instances of could language, but I think as adults, it's very funny.\n",
      "What can you say! Have had this movie since it was first released. Watch every year at Christmas. Laugh every time!\n",
      "Sorry Christmas Story fans, but the Griswold family wins out in our house.  Arrived fast and picture looks great. Merry Christmas!!\n",
      "We love this movie! we watch it at least 4 times each Christmas and it never gets old! A must add to your collection.\n",
      "I grew up watching this movie - it's how we begin our Christmas season on Thanksgiving afternoon. It was about time I owned my own copy. Anyone who has ever tried to host or simply attended a family holiday get-together with great expectations can related to this. These actors playing Audrey and Rusty are the best out of the 4 Griswold vacation movies. You can see Rusty on Big Bang Theory all grown up now.\n",
      "Best Christmas movie ever!  It starts the season for me.  I love to laugh and this always makes me laugh.\n",
      "This movie is definitely...a must see. Randy Quaid steals it! Liked better then the first one!  Great movie to own!\n",
      "Funnest holiday movie ever.  Clark is a perfect example of goods things can happen to bad situations. His nutty family member just add to the zany humor.\n",
      "This movie is just as funny today as when I watched it the first Christmas it came out.  Makes me wanna go buy a chainsaw and cut down a tree!\n",
      "One of me and my family's fave C'mas movies. We constantly quote from it (all year-round!) and we watch it every year on C'mas Night. Chevy is great in it. Classic 80's C'mas movie.\n",
      "\"Christmas Vacation\" is quite possibly one of the funniest movies ever, despite it being Christmas or not.  It is so truthful as to how human beings act when things do not go our way.  And, don't lie, everyone has an Eddie in their family.  This movie is the perfect movie to watch whether you are in a good mood or a bad mood, for it will only make it better.  This is the perfect comedy full of laughs proven to put a smile on Helen Keller's face!\n",
      "Ordered as a gift.  Recipent was very happy to receive it and to my knowledge all is well with the DVD.  Got the order ASAP prompt.  Thank you!\n",
      "Best movie ever!!! One we watch every year around Christmas time, Who doesn't love this movie? no complaints buy it!\n",
      "How can you go wrong?  Big laughs no matter how many times you've seen it over the years.  A must for Christmas.\n",
      "This is by far my favorite movie! I always watch it around the holidays, it makes it all the better. Has awesome humor with an A+ cast. Buy it and watch it as much as you can!!!\n",
      "The Griswold family is set to celebrate the holidays like never before, in \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,\" directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik and written by John Hughes.  Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) has decided to  have a traditional, old-fashioned family Christmas, and has invited his  parents and in-laws to stay with them through the season.  He has a  surprise he wants to share with everyone this year; with his Christmas  bonus from work, he's putting in a pool, to which he's already committed  the down-payment money (so the bonus had better come through, big time, or  he's \"in it up to here\").  To kick off the season, he takes Ellen (Beverly  D'Angelo) and the kids, Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and Rusty (Johnny Galecki)  to the mountains to find the perfect \"Griswold family Christmas tree.  And  it's only the first of one hilarious scene after another, as we follow  Clark and clan through one long laugh-fest, filled with surprises and fun.  Chase is at his best here, in the most enduring (and endearing) character  he's ever done; Clark the Everyman, who only wants the best things for his  family and himself, but whose plans more often than not go awry, doomed to  fall just short of realization.  When he decorates the outside of the  house, he uses 25,000 twinkle lights; they use enough juice to black-out an  entire neighborhood, and they do (once he can get them to work).  Then when  cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn) show up  unexpectedly in the \"RV\" they now call home, Eddie asks Clark if he's  surprised to see him.  Surprised?  Eddie is the last person on earth Clark  expected, or wanted, to see.  \"Eddie,\" he tells him, \"I couldn't be more  surprised if I woke up tomorrow morning with my head sewn to the carpet.\"  Another memorable scene involves a wild squirrel who came in with the  Christmas tree and proceeds to make his appearance during dinner, only to  provoke a wild romp upstairs and down as they all pursue (and in some cases  try to elude) the deadly invader.  A terrific cast was assembled for  this movie, but Quaid is the stand-out, and he perfects the Eddie character  in this one; forever the lamebrain with the big heart, and the one who  takes the situation in hand when Clark's bonus turns out to be an  enrollment in a jelly-of-the-month club.  Clark's parents are played by  Diane Ladd (Nora) and John Randolph (Clark, Sr.), and Ellen's by Doris  Roberts (Frances) and E.G. Marshall (Art).  Other notable performances are  turned in by Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Margo) and Nicholas Guest (Todd), as  Clark's yuppie next door neighbors, and also by William Hickey (Uncle  Lewis) and Mae Questel (Aunt Bethany).  Rounding out the supporting cast  are Nicolette Scorsese (Mary), Cody Burger (Rocky), Ellen Hamilton Latzen  (Ruby Sue) and Brian Doyle-Murray (Frank Shirley).  \"National Lampoon's  Christmas Vacation\" is timeless comedy, a must for every video collection.  It can be watched over and over again, and the humor stays fresh while the  laughs get even bigger.  There's a little bit of every family in here, and  this movie may be just the tonic you'll need some day to get you through  your own \"special\" holiday season.\n",
      "This holiday classic just gets funnier every year. Full of classic lines & great sight gags along with one of Chevy Chase's funniest performances this has become a Christmas standard. The many hilarious scenes include Clark W.Griswold JR. stapling Christmas lights to his roof(and himself) and Clark blousing err browsing while shopping. The scene where Clark goes sledding always gets lots of laughs(it's classic Chevy Chase)! The music is good too as many Christmas favorites old & new fill the great soundtrack. This is simply a very funny Christmas comedy for those looking to laugh around the holiday season.\n",
      "I Still Think Is One Of The Funniest Movies Of All Time!It Is Really Funny.Extremly Funny For A 80's Movie.The Entire Movie Has An Amazing Amount Of Pure Laugh Out Load Comedy.For People Who Put Down Chevy Chase  And The Vacation Movies I Have Only This To Say,\"It's A Little Nipply  Out\".LoL.I Am Really Excited That This On DVD And I Hope To Get It As  Soon As Possible!I Highly Suggest It!These Are Just My Thoughts I Could Be  Wrong But Hey.Bye,Bye,Now.Have A Good Day.\n",
      "I recently purchasedNational Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (Special Edition)after my original VHS was unplayable.  This movie has become a Christmas Tradition in our family.  We watch it every Christmas Eve.  My parents and brother also have copies as we no longer live in the same city.  My parents and sister were at my house for Christmas and when we tryed to watch our beloved movie, no go.  I went on-line and found a copy in DVD.  It arrived a couple of weeks later.  It's great to know that this Christmas we will be set to once again enjoy the comedy of the Griswold family.\n",
      "This arrived in great condition and on time.A movie to add in with your Christmas movie favorites! Gets smiles and lugfhs everytime.\n",
      "I ordered this movie for my son who was having a difficult time finding it in stores. What a great surprise for him to receive it for his birthday in August! He can now watch anytime he wants to and it doesn't have to be in December!Thank you Amazon!\n",
      "Recently bought the blu ray version and watched it again. This movie always makes me laugh, even when I know what's going to happen next. It's a staple in our Christmas movie collection, watch it every year!\n",
      "This story is very funny but also very true to life. It's all about being stuck with family relatives and/or neighbors during Christmas or other holidays. I believe that most American families have at least a few weird relatives who visit during holidays and have \"lived\"  this story. Been there, done that. Really well done.\n",
      "This movie has been a must see each Christmas with the family.  A classic from the first time we saw it.\n",
      "When I first saw this in a theatre I laughed so loud and long I cryed and nearly w,,, myself. But I was not alone as most everyone was laughing also. The flying saucer scence is over the top. Its laugh upon laugh from begining to end. It is now and has been for years a Christmas event in my family.\n",
      "When we get together for Christmas we show this movie. What a gut buster! Hope it never wears out. Funny!\n",
      "A GOOD NATURED \"GOOF\" TRYING TO BRING CHRISTMAS TO HIS FAMILY AND NEIGHBORS....AFTER I SEE IT ANOTHER 20 TIMES, I MIGHT BE TIRED OF IT, BUT THE FIRST 20 HAVE BEEN GREAT..\n",
      "Who couldn't like another National Lampoon movie with Chase and D'Angelo? It's a classic around Christmas Time. It is camp, and Randy Quaid still doesn't do his role justice, but hey...it's National Lampoon. It's not an Academy Award winner, it's a fun movie.\n",
      "will go down forever as a great funny Christmas movie after the Christmas story with 'you'll shoot your eye out'.\n",
      "Chevy Chase is very funny.  This is a good Christmas movie for adults.  I always enjoy this movie every Christmas\n",
      "It's Chevy and Beverly!  What more could you want?  A terrific supporting cast fills out the Griswald Family Christmas Event, with typical Griswald results.  In my estimation, this is the second best film of the series — after the original — and one that has a great feeling of sentimentality!  It is an ode to your over-lit neighbors, your Scrooge-like bosses, your lovable in-laws, and all the expectations and experiences that make the Holiday Season so unpredictable — especially if you're a Griswald!  The sight gags are great, the Family rivals the Adams' in its diversity, but the outcome is what we all hope for at Christmas — Happiness!  If this movie doesn't hit home in one regard or another, then you are not married.  And after seeing this film, you may want to think about it a bit more!  This is a nicely done family film, with Chevy reliving the past while stuck in the attic, determinbed to make Christmas as unforgettable as possible.  It is required viewing; along with \"A Christmas Story\", \"White Christmas\", your favorite \"Scrooge\", and \"A Miracle on 34th Street\" (both of them).  It covers all the bases, and really hits a Home Run!\n",
      "For many years I love to watch this movie during Christmas.  Now my kids request this movie though out the year for a good laugh.\n",
      "I enjoy watching it a couple times a year. The sight gags are funny. Have enjoyed Christmas Vacation for years, it gets me in the Christmas spirit every year.\n",
      "We watch this movie every Christmas season but we only had it on vhs and our vhs player finally broke. Now we're back in business!\n",
      "Pleasant change from the typical movie we get to see these days. Old but still good to watch... no more\n",
      "Very funny movie and great holiday tradition. The ending is a great message as well even if it does sound corny.\n",
      "I already have this on DVD, but thought I would upgrade to BluRay, as this is one of my favorite holiday movies.  I watch it at least twice every Christmas.  I was surprised to see that the quality was noticeable better than the upconverted DVD.  I'm glad I made the purchase.\n",
      "Great film we kick off the holidays with each year. Prime shipping had it to our door in 1 day even the week before Christmas!\n",
      "We watch and enjoy it every year at Christmas time. It is still very funny, and feels like old friends are visiting.\n",
      "Very funny; timeless classic holiday flic; the characters, hijinks, calamities, and relentless determination to preserve Christmas in all its glory is a perfect setup for what takes place.\n",
      "One of the best of the original National Lampoon movies. Better than the first \"Vacation\" and much better than \"European Vacation\". A great cast with memorable lines and scenes throughout the movie.\n",
      "How could you not love this movie. It is so funny. The delivery was very fast. The story line is great Chevy is super. The best movie he ever made I think\n",
      "The best movie of all time.  \"You couldn't hear a dumptruck, crashing through a nitroglycerine plant.\"  \"Gave away all our gas money in Gurney.\"\n",
      "By far a Christmas classic and a tradition for our family to watch and it's all the better now in blu-ray!\n",
      "I do like this film but it is in no way in the same field as the first movie and european vacation. If you liked the first two movies I would suggest renting this first before buying a copy.\n",
      "Top 5 all time best comedy in anyone's book.  Will undoubtedly be a classic Christmastime movie for decades to come.  And don't we all have a Cousin Eddie in our family?  Very funny.\n",
      "This was a great time for family to laugh out loud together.  This movie had us rolling over laughing.  I can't wait to revisit this story when my children have children and we watch it together.\n",
      "This movie is a classic. And perfect for all year round viewing, however, Christmas time is always fitting. I'd recommend it!\n",
      "A great film that is a modern classic.  It's hilarious, disgusting (Randy Quaid is fabulous) and yes even heartwarming (when Sparky watches old home movies while locked in the attic).  We watch it every year.\n",
      "Viewing this movie is an annual event at our house and it is funnier every year.  It is a a no-mind movie that you can just sit back and enjoy, no hidden message, no preaching, just plain fun.  The characters are perfect.\n",
      "I do 99% of  the shopping from Amazon for my family. We have enjoyed Christmas Vacation on DVD for years. This movie has become a regular tradition to watch at least once every Christmas season and sometimes twice. You'll laugh yourself silly. We just got it on Blu-Ray. The  picture quality is outstanding! If you haven't seen this movie, then it's a must see for anyone with a sense of humor.  Signed, Significant Other\n",
      "Can't think of Christmas and not think of this movie.. It is the kind of funny that sticks with you for years to come:)\n",
      "I watch this Christmas movie every year.  It makes for a great addition for anyone's Christmas movie list.  It always makes me laugh!  Again, the real meaning of Christmas comes through, about family, in this movie.  I've loved this movie, from the first time I saw it.\n",
      "We watch this every Christmas! I think something happens to everyone family at Christmas. Family loved it. Thanks amazon we were able to download in a instant.\n",
      "Always have to watch on Christmas Day!  Is the funniest movie with Chevy Chase.  Is a tradition at our house to watch on Christmas!  If you have never seen, you must watch as you will laugh so hard!\n",
      "This is one of the funniest Christmas movies I have ever seen.  Watch it 2-3 times a year, every year.\n",
      "Let me say that I absolutely loved the original \"Vacation\". After that the movies went downhill until this one came out way back when. I loved it the first time that I saw it and have always laughed every year when it is shown around Christmas. This year I figured, \"What the heck\" and decided to buy the Blu-ray. Now I can watch it with my other holiday favorites 'A Christmas Story' and 'The Santa Clause'. Checy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, and Randy Quaid are flawless and the rest of the cast ranks very close.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite Christmas movies.  I can't imagine going through the struggles that Clark Griswald did just to get the perfect tree and to bring joy to his diverse family.  I would recommend it to everyone.\n",
      "I hanve never laughed so much and as hard as I did this movie. I have watched several times and always with the same result, I see somethng I missed while laughing at some of the content. Great acting by all the actors and be prepared to laugh.\n",
      "A good laugh every few minutes.  I've seen this movie many times and will probably watch it every Christmas season for years to come.\n",
      "Great streaming, very clear and had no problems with this all time great Christmas movie that can be watched anytime of the year!\n",
      "And this one does that. Parents, Grandparents and children like this movie. Nuff said.  Oh and really catchy theme song...\n",
      "Best movie ever very funny and well made. I loved all of the characters and how well they interfaced. Loved it!!\n",
      "This is a humorous film to re-live during the Christmas season. It's a bit over the topbut still produces laughs for the whole family.\n",
      "Been watching this for years with my sons - and they know most of the dialogue and one liners pretty well by now. This is just a fun movie to watch, corny as it is but who out there can't relate the story to some of their own Christmas memories?. For me, this flick is a holiday must have!\n",
      "We have a collection of our favorite Christmas films on DVD and this is one of them.  Very funny, somewhat irreverant, but tires you out from laughing.  Highly recommended!\n",
      "Christnas Vacation, Elf, and A Christmas Story all celebrate the season and are the core of our Christmas viewing. SNL favorites from the past still bring laughs - even when you know what's coming. Not quite a cult classic\n",
      "If this film is not already a Christmas classic, it will certainly be in that group a few years down the road. Aside from the \"Vacation\" series, this movie stands on its own legs as a hilarious look into the life of Clark W. Griswold, trying to give his family the great American Christmas.There are very few slow moments in the film, which contributes to the fact that you can watch it over and over and over again, not getting sick of it (remember - a classic). It is also filled with countless memorable moments and one-liners, almost on par with \"Caddyshack.\"This film succeeds on two levels of comedy. The first is that it manages to place its characters in funny *situations* as opposed to simply having them try to speak funny lines. This is the mark of a lasting movie. The second level of success is in the humor itself (the dialogue, the one-liners, etc.). It has what it takes to be a classic.As for the special edition, it's worth it because of the commentary, which includes Randy Quaid (Eddie), Beverly D'Angelo (Ellen), Johnny Galecki (Russ), Miriam Flynn (Catherine), Director Jermemiah Chechik and Producer Matty Simmons. They get off to a rough, slow start, but if you hang in there they eventually get it going. But where's Clark? I was very surprised that Chevy Chase didn't make an appearance on the DVD anywhere, and during the commentary the others spoke about him as though he were deceased. I wonder if there was a little falling out...?The transfer to DVD is wonderful. The picture quality is great, unlike other recent releases like the special edition of \"A Christmas Story\" which contains no film restoration whatsoever.All in all, this is one that you buy. You'll throw it in again and again starting around mid-November, and it will soon become part of your Christmas tradition.\n",
      "If you haven't seen this before---Where have you been this is a classic. If you like slapstick comedy you'll love this. And watch for Chevy to ride the snow saucer, I almost hurt myself laughing.There's a great cast, including Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Dennis Quaid, and many great character actors.There's a of discussion about what constituits great features, but the film alone is worth the price----You won't be sorry if you get this one!!!\n",
      "I love this movie funny as all get out. Clark & Eddie are great as well as the whole cast.\n",
      "THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST FILM EVER MADE. If you watch this film and don't at least snicker, check your pulse and buzz the nurse...you're DEAD. The crazyness that takes place in the beginning is only subdued by the ending that we all pray never darkens our wreathed door.This is the TRUTH...for our Christmas party where I work, it is mandated that all who enter must recite a line from this film to enter. No Kidding! If Clark doesn't represent every guy who tries to bring a Christmas that the family will remember, may my lights never glow on my house again.Watch this film...It's the Real Thing!!\n",
      "It's a Christmas tradition in our family to watch this movie, along with \"It's a Wonderful Life\", \"Miracle on 34th Street\" and \"A Christmas Story\".One of those rare comedies that never gets old, and is just as funny the 50th viewing as it was the first.\n",
      "This is a modern day classic, we watch it several times a year. Give it a watch it will make you smile too.\n",
      "this is an epic Christmas film. quality of the digital file is great. I'll watch it again next year, and the year after\n",
      "classicstreaming was good over wifi through wii picture was good for non hd movie will watch again next year\n",
      "One of the best Christmas movies ever. I even watch it in the off season, I can probably quote the whole thing line for line.\n",
      "It was not quit as funny as I remembered, but it was good just the same! I highly recommend everyone watch this during the holiday season!\n",
      "We normally watch this movie every year while we decorate the Christmas tree. Puts you in the Christmas spirit. At least for us it does. Typical Chevy Chase stupidity. If you like Chevy Chase, you will like this movie.\n",
      "This hilarious Christmas Comedy is surely becoming a Classic for the holiday season. Although I have seen this movie at least a dozen times, I still get a big laugh out of it. The characters are fantastic.\n",
      "This is, without a doubt, one of th funiest movies ever done.  No matter how many times we have seen it, it still makes us laugh.If you haven't seen it, you have to get it otherwise you'll be missing some get laughs.\n",
      "I find it difficult to start the holiday season without a good showing of this movie.  If you enjoy Christmas and comedy this one will do the trick.\n",
      "I loved this movie.  It's a Christmas classic that everyone should watch during the holidays.  In fact it should be mandatory.  It's a \"must have\" title if you haven't added it to your collection yet.\n",
      "This movie has become a part of our Christmas! The season just doesn't get underway without Clark and cuz Eddie!\n",
      "Although We've seen this film several times over the years it still entertains us, giving us some welcome laughs.  Silly?  Yes.  Entertaining?  Yes, very.\n",
      "Who doesn't love Clark Griswold? Christmas classic.... It has a lot more swear words than I remember so I would caution when watching with your children.\n",
      "We find this movie to be wonderful family entertainment. Have seen it before but it continues to be a favorite.\n",
      "I love this movie even though I have seen it many times it always makes for many laughs. It shows family life in a great light.\n",
      "What I would like to know is WHERE CAN I GET THE ORIGINAL, CHRISTMAS VACATION ON DVD. The one currently sold is missing a number of scenes?Please let me know, Thank you, it might not even be possible.\n",
      "A Christmas tradition for us, along with 'A Christmas Story'.  Bought this to replace out old VHS tape which someone borrowed and never returned.  Quite a clever spin on Scrooge.\n",
      "Love this movie, glad it's out on BD now.  The original DVD was not a wide screen format which looks \"old\" on a wide screen TV.  This movie is a family tradition every holiday season at our house!\n",
      "We've owned this movie in other formats since it came out many years ago, and still enjoy watching it!  The detail of the Blu-ray version brings to life all over again.  Well worth the money.\n",
      "The 2nd best of all vacation movie. This one is nuts. Should be seen every Christmas. Uncle Eddy at his best.\n",
      "This movie continues to create smiles.  Even though it is kinda old, we all watch it every Christmas.  The one liners are just too good.\n",
      "Always very funny.  A great group of actors that can be very convincing as to their quirky personalities.  I have seen this movie at least a dozen times and may see it a dozen more.\n",
      "Seems to be a very good movie . Funny on point makes since and seems to bring out a little Christmas cheers.\n",
      "Fun classic movie!!!  We love watching each year.  It has become a tradition.  Chevy Chase is at his best in this movie.\n",
      "This is the exact same transfer as the 2006 Blu-ray of this movie. Google reviews of it and you will see it is terrible. Warner needs to put some cleanup time into this transfer and less time adding junk like instant snow and mini-mugs. WE want the BEST video and audio POSSIBLE! My favorite Christmas movie gets shafted once again...\n",
      "I had purchased this movie many years ago when it first came out and thought it was absolutely hysterical.  Now, this many years later, in speaking with my sister about some \"relatives\" that she was having some concerns over, I snidely commented that her story reminded me of the Chevy Chase Movie, Christmas Vacation.  She either didn't remember this movie or actually had never seen it before so I immediately went to Amazon.com (which always has the best prices)and ordered one for her.It arrived within a few days and the next phone call I received was the sound of my sister laughing hysterically as she thanked me for the great gift.  They plan to share it with several neighbors so I know this DVD will really be seen by many.  Good way to start laughter 'round the world.\n",
      "I bought this for a good friend who had never seen the movie, I didn't know such a person existed!\n",
      "This movie is definitely just as hilarious the second and third time as it was the first time we watch it.\n",
      "Great Christmas movie!  Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid is absolutely awesome in these roles and this is the best Vacation movie! Hands down!\n",
      "Came very fast. One of the best wild and wacky movies ever made. Each of us has our own favorite scenes of chaos or disorder.\n",
      "We love this movie! This is our second order; we'd had it long ago as a VHS tape.Just Hilarious.\n",
      "Hilarious!  A must watch every holiday season. My son knows nearly every word by heart.  You can't go wrong with this one.\n",
      "This is an annual classic in my family. I've watched it year after year and never tire of it. Excellent!\n",
      "One of the best National Lampoon's Vacation movies. I would highly reccomend this to anyone who is thinking about getting this movie.\n",
      "Super movie when you see it on t.v. but even funnier when you see it with special effects and in this special edition.  All National Lampoon lovers have to have this movie!\n",
      "It is real refreshing to watch a reenactment of my Christmases of long past. I would recommend everyone to watch. Beware there are a few swears but nothing like today's movies.\n",
      "The funniest Christmas movie ever. We watch it alot every holiday season! They don't make them like this anymore.. If your looking for a good laugh this is it.\n",
      "This is a classic comedy.  Its hard not to love it! Very funny and a great holiday movie to watch!\n",
      "I had some reservation when I noticed it's an 1989 movie. Without all Hollywood special effect, how good could it possibly be? But I was wrong. It's a warm heart movie that fits the holiday season the best. It's funny from beginning till the end and it reminded my usual Christmas gathering with my grandparents, parents, uncles and cousins. Just enjoy it!\n",
      "This is our favorite family Christmas comedy. We have played it many times and BluRay is even better. Love it.\n",
      "The little under the breath comments made by cast throughout this movie make it hilarious. It wouldn't be Christmas without this one! Go on get yourself something real nice Clark!\n",
      "It wouldn't be Christmas for us without watching \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.\"  The movie is fun for the whole family to watch.\n",
      "This one was an instant classic when it first came to theaters in the late 80s. See Chevy Chase at the top of his game. If you've heard of Christmas, you will love this movie.\n",
      "Because it's a great fun family movie parts in it for the kids and parts for adults overall a great movie\n",
      "\"Clark I'd like to try and fumigate this here chair. It's a quality item, if you don't mind me asking how much she set ya back?\"\n",
      "Greatest Christmas movie ever.  What Christmas is really like for most Americans.  Second best Vacation movie behind the original one.\n",
      "There are christmas movies and then there are F'n Christmas movies and this one is by far the only one to stand the test of time!! it takes me back to when i was a kid and shouldnt have been able to watch but i did! and it looks incredible on blu ray! 5 stars all the way\n",
      "This is a movie everyone should watch at Christmas. So many good one liners in it. Watching Clark loose his mind is fantastic!\n",
      "The only movie we watch at least once a year.\n",
      "This is a must watch for me every year around Christmas. This was  a gold box special and I could not pass it up!\n",
      "Funny from beginning to end. Brings some comic relief to a sometimes stressful holiday time. Watch it over and over again!\n",
      "This movie has to be the funniest movie around. Its become a Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve tradition. The best part was when Clark cuts down the tree and it smashes into the neighbors window taking the window blinds. And  when Clark says a mouthfull of names about his boss.\n",
      "This movie is funny every time you watch it. It doesn't matter how long ago it came out. A must see every year.\n",
      "If you grew up in the 50s or 60s than you are probably a bigger fan of The Christmas Story, but if you are younger than you can not get better than this.  This is Chevy at his best and a great story. There are times when Randy Quaid almost steals the show.One of the things that makes Chevy / Clark so endearing is his innocence.  A man who is just trying to give his family a memorable holiday.  Thanks to Chevy, he has given my family many memorable laughs.\n",
      "The best Christmas movei of all time!Chevy Chase and Family plan a wonderful down home Christmas, butif you have even seen a Chevy Chase movie... This is not happening.Get your popcorn ready!!Love it!!\n",
      "I see a bit of all of us in this one.  A hilarious twist on the Christmas story.  hehe ho ho ho\n",
      "I have a DVD already and my family has been watching it during every Christmas.  Now we have a Blue-ray player so I bought one Blue-ray format this year to enjoy again.  This movie is the best among all those Christmas movies.\n",
      "Over Christmas I didn't get a chance to see this movie on TV, so I purchased it myself. It arrived in great condition, plays good, and no complaints.\n",
      "A Christmas classic!  Simply one of my favorite movies to watch at Christmas time.  A must see every year during the Christmas season.\n",
      "My family watches this movie religiously every Christmas! Great packaging and very fast shipping! I would definitely recommend anyone who hasn't seen this movie to watch it!\n",
      "This is epic. Anyone who's ever seen this movie knows there really isn't anything that needs to be said other than...awesome!! Watch this every year, sometimes more than once. Though I thought I was ordering just the movie, I was pleasantly surprised to receive a tin with the movie and other things like coasters and reusable snow! Amazing!\n",
      "Enjoyed the movie. Nice for a good laugh.  We all have some of those relatives to some degree.  A new Christmas classic in our family.\n",
      "This is mine and my husbands all time favorite christmas movie (his nickname is \"Sparky\" lol.) We have it on VHS and just upgraded it to DVD since the VHS is worn out. This movie is just great, I recommend it to everyone. We watch every year 2 or 3 times. Even the kids love it now.\n",
      "🎄❄️🎅 holiday comedy to put you in the Christmas spirit! Chevy chase is awesome...nothing says Christmas like the Griswolds's. Haha!\n",
      "This movie will have you laughing. It is great for the whole family. My daughters family watch it every year all together. A family tradition. I recommend it\n",
      "I never get tire of this movie. I watch it every year on television and finally decided it was time to own it\n",
      "I hadn't seen this movie in a while and forgot how funny it truly was.  The family is in complete agreement that this will be a new family tradition every year at Christmas time from now on.\n",
      "No matter how many times I watch this movie, it always makes me laugh out loud. The movie never gets old!\n",
      "Those were the days when great movies were made.  It is so funny.  Wish they would make movies like this now.  Maybe the writers need to watch this and get back to making movies worth watching.\n",
      "My husband and I watch this every year before Christmas.  It makes us realize our family may not be so dysfunctional after all.  And no matter how many times we watch it, we always have a good laugh.  One of the funniest movies I've ever seen.\n",
      "Enjoy watching a classic movie with Chevy Chase.  This classic holiday movie provides you humor that leaves you chuckling after you have seen it. Must see!\n",
      "I watch this movie every year at Christmas time. I love it that much. It is sooo funny and well done. The nuances are so well done and understated and I love the cat scene!!!\n",
      "This movie is a family favorite. We watch it every year. Sometimes 2+ times a year. Last year, we watched it with a relative who is new to a lot of American Christmas movies and traditions. She loved this movie. This was a gift for her this year. She was so excited when she opened it on Christmas morning. When we watched it, the quality was crisp and clear. The sound was perfect. Just like you would expect a Blu-ray to be. Perfect.\n",
      "The video quality is outstanding for this hd film. Love this classic from my childhood. Had to have more words.\n",
      "If you have never seen this movie it is RIBS. Must watch. Seriously, watch this movie at this very second.\n",
      "Watch it every year around the holidays and LAUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My grandkids have memorized most of the lines since we have been watching it since they were little\n",
      "New sealed and on time. Just as described. I cant wait to watch it next year! The blu ray made just enough of a difference that im glad i got it!\n",
      "Chevy Chase is hysterical!  I'm not sure if its because he reminds me of my father or because I'm Jealous that I can't have a Christmas like this to look back and laugh at.  The scene after the squirrel runs out the door and the old generation tries to leave is my favorite!\n",
      "This is my favorite all time Christmas movie of all time! I had a copy of it, but when we moved, it some how got lost. While on maternity leave last Christmas, my husband ordered this movie for me, because he knows how much I love it and how upset I was when I lost my first copy. Totally made my Christmas last year!\n",
      "no Backward or Ahead as far as the Lip sync goes. This Dvd works well and lips are in sync with sound and words.  its Nice Thanks!\n",
      "Are ju kidding me?! Its a classic! I love this movie anytime of the year and ESPECIALLY at Xmas time!\n",
      "I was going to do a long review on what makes this movie so great, but that would exceed the 1,000 word limit so I'm going to tell what I don't like about National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. The one thing I would change would be the scene where the girl from the store, Mary, dives into Clark's imaginary pool. They don't show her topless and that has always annoyed me.\n",
      "Personally, I don't get it. But my husband adores this movie. So, I guess it's a good one...according to him.\n",
      "At our house, this is a christmas must see. Lots of action,  Thankfully our christmas always goes more smoothly then the Griswalds.\n",
      "Some of the scenes from this movie have become traditional laughs for my family.  Love the Yuppie couple next door that are too \"sophisticated\" for Christmas, and I love the overall theme of the movie that Christmas is for going all-out for your family.  There are all the favorite characters from the \"Vacation\" movie - cousin Eddie and his family; the sexy blond model; plus some new characters - the inlaws.  If you haven't seen the movie be warned that there's a cat that gets electrocuted by chewing on Christmas lights, but it's done in a funny way, but some cat-lovers may not like it.  Anyway, I'm a cat lover and it doesn't really bother me because the whole movie is done in a positive way, looking at all the craziness and disasters that can happen at Christmas, including having to put up with visiting in-laws, and there's going to be something in this movie that makes you say - \"that happened to us one year!\"  For us, it was the overcooked turkey - we had one almost as bad as the Griswold's turkey!  The Griswold kids are actually very loving and supportive of their parents while still being typical kids, bored one minute and excited the next, and Ellen is great as usual.  The last scenes about the \"kidnapping\" of Clark's boss are absolutely hysterical and the best part, in my opinion.  Good movie.\n",
      "We watch this movie, more than once every year during Christmastime, without fail. The best is while wrapping gifts Christmas Eve, with all of the adults that are up late, and we just laugh and laugh and have a grand old time! Enjoy! You'll love it!The version I have has a special feature where you can watch the original version, or a version that has commentary from the actors during the movie, which is also hilarious!*Of course this is a full blown comedy mind you, so if you're looking for that \"It's a wonderful life\" message, stick with It's a Wonderful Life. Which is a wonderful movie too, along with many others.\n",
      "My family & I have made this a tradition to watch every year.  Well made major motion picture.  Good entertainment value, nice for an evening of sitting back and enjoying classic americam made cinema.\n",
      "This movie has become one of the \"new\" Christmas classics. I never let a Christmas season go by without watching it.\n",
      "From beginning to end, this movie is full of laughs. It's the best christmas movie out there by far. Chevy Chase shines.\n",
      "I own three movies on VHS (those were movies on tape before there were DVD's and digital downloads, for those of you to young to know better), and this movie is one of them.  This movie is a Christmas comedy classic. Anyone who is a fan of Saturday Night Live will find this movie hilarious. Chevy Chase is brilliant. If the Holliday's get you down, then watch this movie. It will have you rolling on the floor with laughter. And, besides, if your a Prime member it won't cost any more than your time. Merry Christmas!\n",
      "great classic xmas movie much better on blueray. Highly recommend you get Blu-ray for the great picture and sound. Watch this movie with my family every xmas since it came out on vhs, its a family tradition\n",
      "I would urge anyone that for whatever reason has not seen this to immediately go watch it!  It will become a Christmastime viewing tradition for years to come!  I can’t think of a day regardless of the time of year that I don’t use a quote from this movie!  Love it!!!\n",
      "This one of my wife and I's favorite movies.  And having it in HD just makes it that much greater.  A must have.\n",
      "It doesn't get any better than this when you're looking for some good laughs without any hardcore, raunchy language.  A classic the entire family can enjoy over and over again.\n",
      "as always chevy chase is being funny for Christmas in this movie just like he was in the Vegas vacation and others\n",
      "What a classic and they don't make them like this anymore... A movie that has to be watched every Christmas!!!\n",
      "Well done Clark, well done! This is the funniest Christmas movie ever made...period. From the dept. of redundancy dept. \"it's the gift that keeps on giving\"\n",
      "My wife and I can watch this movie over twenty times each season and not flinch!  We pretty much have the dialogue memorized after all these years and it's still as funny as ever.  A must see for the holidays!\n",
      "Neat little bundle of \"Christmas Vacation\" Griswold & Marty Moose goodies in this tin for any fan of the best holiday film since Bing Crosby tap danced with Danny ___ Kaye!You get 4 coasters w/ scenes & quotes from the movie, a thing of fake snow (the box has Marty Moose on it), a Santa hat w/ Marty Moose embroidered along the edge, and -- my favorite -- a pin that says \"I survived a Griswold Family Christmas\" w/ Marty Moose on it. The tin also has photos from the movie all over it.The presentation -- with the decorative tin, collectables, and DVD -- makes a great gift, too!\n",
      "Hilarious, a classic!  It is so much fun to watch.  My family and I watch it every Holiday Season.  We never grow tired of it.\n",
      "It is a classic! I love this dvd,excellent condition,fast delivery and no commercials to ruin a wonderful christmas classic but best of all,,Chevy Chase,He is a class act by himself,,Love this movie!!!!!\n",
      "Just simply a classic.  A ritual to watch each and every Christmas Eve.  I think i know every line by heart\n",
      "I have worn out VHS and a few DVD copy's of this movie over the last 23 or so years!  It has become quite the annual tradition in my house!  This copy was purchased just to have a newer media type,  I still have a good DVD of it but wanted to go ahead and get the blu-ray.  I intend to always have this flick around and ready!\n",
      "Love this movie. Classic Christmas Movie! You can't go wrong with the Griswold Family.  Chevy Chase entertains in the same way he always has.\n",
      "I love this Christmas theme movie. Very funny with great characters. It is a must see movie for the holidays.\n",
      "Everyone must own this and watch it more than once. It's a Chevy Chase classic.\n",
      "This has to be on everyone's Christmas movie watch list. Funny and great family viewing. It is pop culture and is still referenced to this day when people decorate their homes for Christmas.\n",
      "The Vacation series are so funny.  After the original one, this one is my second favorite.  I never get tired of watching this movie.\n",
      "We love watching this movie every year at Christmas time and is actually a tradition now in our family. One of our favorites.\n",
      "Besides The Christmas Story this is a must have movie for the Christmas season. It along with The Christmas Story are the icon movies of the past.\n",
      "We love this movie. It has become a family tradition for us to watch this movie every year right after decorating our Christmas tree. Of course the children sneak it out to watch it many times throughout the year. It really makes us laugh!\n",
      "HEEE-larious!! Best one-liners ever ... love me some silly slapstick and Randy Quaid is nasty/awesome! Chevy Chase at his finest.\n",
      "I have loved everything about this film since I was young. I own it on VHS, DVD, and Bluray. Never gets old.\n",
      "Great movie, good transfer, until a better transfer is out this one can do. Price is decent for u to make your own judgement\n",
      "This has become one of our family classics as well.  While it is irreverent at times & completely unbelievable other times I think that we can all relate to this movie at Christmas.  It addresses our hopes & dreams, frustrating family relationships & many misadventures that threaten to destroy the holiday.  In the end all is resolved in a poignant & funny way.\n",
      "Christmas Vacation is one of THE best Christmas movies that you can watch over and over again and not be bored with! It's one of my personal holiday favorites that I have to watch at least once a season! The entire movie is  so absolutely funny- from the \"little full, lot of sap\" tree to  Grandma singing the \"Star Spangled Banner\", it keeps you in  stitches from beginning to end! So if you want to watch a holiday movie  that will leave you with Christmas cheer, this is definitely the one for  you!\n",
      "This is the best Christmas movie ever, never lugged so hard! Where is Chevy Chase now? We need a part 2!\n",
      "A Christmas classic!  I have watched this yearly since it was released.  It is funny, campy, and pure 80's everything.\n",
      "This movie is so funny! I always love to watch this around the holidays -- great quotable movie lines too!\n",
      "This is a modern classic every family should watch for Christmas.  I see new things every time I watch it and it just does not get old.\n",
      "Some of our family members watch this every Christmas so that it has now become a Christmas tradition!  I personally think it's a little silly but still entertaining.\n",
      "Some of it is predictable, but Chevy Chase's slapstick comedy can't be beat!  Randy Quaid stands out as the relative that is so disgusting you can't put it into words.  It makes me smile just writing this review.\n",
      "Every year my dad and I have many Christmas traditions. My favorite one: watching this movie on Christmas Eve. It's a classic, and no matter how many times we watch it, it never gets old.\n",
      "This is a great family Christmas movie that reminds me a lot of my own family at Christmas. I grew up with this movie.\n",
      "One of my favorite to watch during the Christmas season. Chevy Chase is hilarious! The family interaction, the work interactions, so close to reality you have to laugh.\n",
      "i can not imagine christmas without this movie do not know what ole clark will think of next. never a dull moment in the griswalds life\n",
      "and decided to give a copy as a secret santa gift.  It was a hit as most everyone in the USA is well familiar with this movie.  mine arrived quickly and was new.\n",
      "We watch this movie every year and it never gets old. If your looking for laughs and fun look no further than Christmas Vacation!\n",
      "This has been my most favorite Christmas movie. I still love the classics, which in my opinion this one has become. I can really identify with the stress of having family over for a big holiday get together. I sometimes feel like Clarke Griswold!\n",
      "This is a GREAT Holiday Movie!  Our entire family watches it every year! Big laughs!  We love all of Chevy Chase's Movies\n",
      "This is by far my most favorite movie of all time.  I still laugh when i watch it even after all these years.  I had a chance to go to  the studios where it was filmed and I stood in front of the house and threw back my head and laughed again and again.  It's got some great statements too.  \"Well it's Christmas and so we are all miserable\" is a classic line, and one of my favorites.\n",
      "I bought this DVD to replace a much-used VHS that we bought in 1991. I really enjoy the \"extras\" which included commentary from several of the actors in the movie. They give interesting background information about the shooting of many of the scenes. Randy Quaid reveals the real life person he patterned his character \"Cousin Eddy,\" as well as an interesting tidbit about being related to Gene Autry.\n",
      "Love this movie! A hilarious classic! Ranks right up there with the 1st Police Academy movie!\n",
      "I watch this movie every year. I have it on DVD but because I now own a 60\" plasma TV I decided to buy the BR copy. It looked great.\n",
      "I love this movie. I wish I could let my son watch it, but there's some profanity in it. They do drop the \"f bomb\" in it, which is a drag, because if it didn't have the profanity it would be a great family film! Love, love, love this movie.\n",
      "I watch this movie every Christmas and still giggle like a school girl. I recommend it for anyone that is stressed at the holiday season.\n",
      "Every Christmas we watch this movie.  It is one of the few movies our family never gets tired of.  It is funny each year and is a tradition to watch.\n",
      "This is by far my favorite Christmas movie.  I laugh every time I've watched it, every single year!  I wanted one for my own collection and the price was right.\n",
      "This is one of the must see Christmas movies!  It is hilarious and very entertaining for the whole family!  Enjoyed it!\n",
      "This movie is a classic around the holidays.  Can't watch this movie too many times.  Chevy Chase and the entire cast is great.\n",
      "There are some movies that it just doesn't matter how many timesthey come on, you just have to sit and watch them.  This is one of those rare jewels.Chevy Chase does an outstanding job in this laugh a minute film,showing us, despite all the good intentions we may have, thingsjust are never perfect.  No, not even at that wonderful Seasonwe call Christmas!A lesson on life wrapped up in a chuckle a minute story.This one should be in every home and watched every year!\n",
      "A little dated, but doggone funny. We laughed from start to finish so will probably watch it every Christmas just for the laughs!!\n",
      "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a great, light-hearted holiday movie. There are some scenes that may be difficult for young children to watch but overall it is a great family movie. I love watching this movie every Christmas. It never fails to bring laughter and lift some of the stress during the holiday season.\n",
      "For us baby boomers this is our Christmas Classic and a classic it is.  Since I saw it in the theater when it premiered way back when,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacationhas been a staple in my household every Thanksgiving since.  Like \"It's A Wonderful Life\" Christmas Vacation is now a part of the heritage of Christmas.\n",
      "Not sure why the critics did not like this movie so much when it was released, but it is far superior to a most of the modern toxic sweet Christmas movies out there! Very excellent humor, with still a touch of the classic kindness for the season. Of course I am not interested in what most critics think anyway, I rate movies on whether or not they entertain me and this is a tradition at our house every year!!\n",
      "Every Christmas Eve I put the presents under the tree, straighten the stockings, and never forget to watch National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  Chevy Chase returns as Clark Griswald and gives his funniest performance yet.  Beverly D'Angelo is also back as Ellen, and not to mention Randy Quaid has also returned to play good old Uncle Eddy.  This movie will have you laughing the whole time.  The DVD could have a better selection of extra's but trust me, the movie is satisfying enough.What makes this movie different from the rest of the Vacation movies is the fact that the Griswalds don't actually take a vacation.  Instead they stay home and invite the in-laws to join them for the holidays.  One of the greatest moments in the movie would have to be when Eddy kidnaps Clark's boss to fufill Clark's Christmas wish.Forget \"The Santa Clause\", \"A Christmas Story\", and \"A Miracle on 34th Street\".  Christmas Vacation is the new Christmas DVD classic!\n",
      "This is by far the best Christmas movie of all time.  What makes it even better for me is I only view this movie once a year on Christmas Eve.  Now it is hard to do, but it makes it about fifty times better.  The movie stars Chevy Chase as Clark Griswold, a father and husband who wants the best for his family but always manages to lure disasters upon them, not to mention himself.Even from the opening scene in the film, Clark nearly creates an early death for the family.  Beverly D' Angelo returns as Clark's uptight wife Hellen.  Now one thing that you should know about Clark is that he always gives 110% with everything he does.  His Christmas tree is about 15 feet tall, and his Christmas lights cause an energy loss throughout the entire city of Chicago.Unlike the other Vacation films, the Griswolds stay home for Christmas and invite just about every relative they have to celebrate the holiday with them.  Even the ones they don't invite show up.  This would be none other than Clark's budweiser-filled Uncle Eddie along with his wife Katherine and two children.  Not to mention a doberman pincher that won't stop destroying the house.\"Christmas Vacation\" is a movie that will be sure to attract laughs and will have you wishing it were Christmas everyday of the year!\n",
      "I love this movie.It brings back alot of memories.I used to watch this every Christmas when I was a kid,and I still do lol This is a great comedy Christmas classic.You'll be laughing the whole way through the movie.It's great!\n",
      "This movie is a classic - well acted - one of Chevy's best movies.  This movie is funny from beginning to end.\n",
      "My family watches this every year.  I've seen it so many times and I still laugh my tail off.\n",
      "This isn't the best 'Vacation' by a long shot, but it is still as funny. In fact, it could be the funniest Christmas movie ever.\n",
      "Great tradition to watch this movie however if it didn't have some of the language it would be appropriate for the entire family.\n",
      "It will be watched every single holiday season until I die. I don't know of any other way to give it a greater compliment. Enough said.\n",
      "I love this show, I have to watch it every year during the holidays, it reminds me so much of my dad.\n",
      "I watch this every year! Every year I laugh more! It is a great movie! I highly recommend it every year.\n",
      "The DVD was shipped well & was perfect. Played well & no scratches. Good shipper..fast & packed well. Will purchase from them again if they have what I am looking for.\n",
      "Great movie to watch for Christmas.  My family is way to much like the Griswolds. Blu ray is always great.\n",
      "This has to be my favorite Christmas movie of all time. Probably because it reminds me so much of my own childhood.\n",
      "A classic holiday favorite to watch when you want to exercise your funny bone! One of those movies you watch every year.\n",
      "One of our favorite christmas movies. There is some language but you can't go wrong with it for adults and teenagers.\n",
      "The movie was new and arrived in its original packaging.  Our family watched the movie Thanksgiving weekend and had some good laughs.  There were no issues with the CD jumping, warbling, etc.\n",
      "Chevy Chase is hilarious!!!! Plus the battle between the two families makes for non stop laughter throughout the whole movie.\n",
      "Very funny movie.  I can relate to a lot of stuff that is in it.  I know they show it on cable every Christmas but I want to be able to play it at my convenience.\n",
      "Great movie.  Probably the best of the series.  Recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh or two or three.\n",
      "Great movie. This is one of our family's favorites. Perfect anytime of the year. Streaming video was smooth and clear.\n",
      "This is really a fun movie.  My family watches it once a year and it's funny each time we watch it.  I highly recommend it as a \"pick me up\".  Many times Christmas is a sad time for some and if you watch this movie, you'll laugh.  It's a \"must\" for the holidays.\n",
      "It is not Christmas until I see this movie, and its a wonderful life, and a Christmas Carol.  the scene when Chavy Chase is looking out of his kitchen window is priceless that was so well done.  And when he get left at home and is sitting in the attic with Ray Charles music playing in the background brings tear to my eyes.  A very good movie\n",
      "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (Special Edition)Here is agin a move for the whole family.  This was a hoot when it came out and hasn't changed a bit.  Just as Funny as ever.\n",
      "Every Christmas my family gets together to watch this one and A Christmas Story.  We just laugh and laugh, and it's a great stress reliever with the holidays being how they are alot of times.\n",
      "This movie never dies.Every year this movie is shown on the TV but I prefer to have my own.Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid bring out the best in this old classic that NEVER DIES.It still makes me laugh.My family still watches this one every Christmas and still laugh.Movies like this are just not made now days.\n",
      "This is an all time classic Christmas comedy. Everyone can relate to this dysfunctual family on some level. This is by far the best Chevy Chase movie. It has all the workings of a perfect comedy. \"The perfect Christmas!\" Hah! The crazy and not smart brother in law, The Grandparents! The crazy Aunt & Uncle, the uptight neighbors, selfish boss, and delusional man who thinks he can make a perfect Christmas. I mean come on, how do you staple yourself to the house? LOL! 100 extention cords plugged into the same wall socket. We watch this movie EVERY Thanksgiving after dinner. It is our family tradition & always will be...oh yeh, lets not forget about Clark in the attic. Merry Christmas!\n",
      "Good old movie, just right for a family with teenagers!  Not as funny as Christmas with the Kranks, but almost!\n",
      "This a great Holiday movie. It quickly became a tradition in my house to pop this movie in while decorating our tree. Laughter throughout.\n",
      "I watch this every year during the Christmas holidays. It's a classic. I've lived in snow-free Los Angeles for the last twelve years. This movie helps get me in the holiday mood. I love seeing the snow.\n",
      "Always funny after all these years. This movie has become an annual event in our household. Entertaining. A reason for being a movie, correct.\n",
      "I watch this movie every holiday season.  No matter how many times I have watched this, it makes me laugh all over again.  But I don't consider this a family movie, not suitable for young children.\n",
      "Everyone I know has seen it so I bought it for me to keep up.  It is so funny and sweet.\n",
      "ROFL, silly, goofy fun family movie for the holidays. great acting, 99% clean jokes :)P.S. is squirrel really considered to be a scary animal in the US? :)\n",
      "It doesn't seem like Christmas without spending some time with the Griswold's. The mishaps Clark always runs into, the family coming in foe the holidays, the uninvited  guests, the cranky next door neighbors, and the stingy boss.  It is funny because we all experience some or most of this during the holidays and it helps us to know that we are not alone.\n",
      "It's a christmas classic! I don't think I can go one year without watching this.. It brings in the Christmas spirit alongside A Christmas Story.\n",
      "I first saw Christmas vacation when I was very young and ever since then, my family has watched it every Christmas, and we still laugh hysterically along during Clark Griswald's \"Family Christmas\". A stunningly funny cast, great story line, and of course a wonderful soundtrack (that we can seem to never find) make this truely a holiday tradition that my family has enjoyed for a very long time. With out a doubt, Christmas Vacation is the best holiday movie I've seen, and it just isn't Christmas until we watch it!\n",
      "Not only is Christmas Vacation my favorite Christmas movie and my favorite comedy movie, it ranks near the top on my personal list of movies of any genre. I've seen it so many times I know the dialogue by heart. I know what's coming and I still laugh out loud - every time. THE BEST!!!\n",
      "The group at national lampoon have a real winner in this one.  It is the christmas from hell, and about the greatest christmas comedy there is.  It is decided to have an old fashion christmas... all the family on both sides gathering together to celebrate christmas, and the joy of family.  Well, it is national lampoon, so you know thats not all together whats going to happen.  When you mix in-laws, snooty neighbors, alcohol, and the less desirable part of any family, you get something great!  It's 97 minutes of National Lampoons best!\n",
      "This movie is in my top 5 all time favorite Christmas movies.  The blu-ray quality it good and everything works properly.  I would recommend this movie!\n",
      "Though perhaps not a classic on the scale of reknown that A Christmas Story, It's a Wonderful Life, etc enjoy, Christmas Vacation is undoubtedly the funniest of the season.  With required viewing of at least 10 times between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day, this showcasing of Chevy Chase, Randy Quaid, and the rest of the cast will live on as a paramount kickoff to the Christmas spirit and holiday family cheer.  Long Live the Griswolds!\n",
      "A must watch every Christmas. It is a family favourite and is just one part of our Christmas movie marathon.\n",
      "Every Christmas, regardless of where we are celebrating the Christmas holidays, THIS is THE MOVIE to watch! It is a classic and so much fun, regardless of your age!!\n",
      "Great fun to watch. Chevy Chase at his best, and then entire cast is great. A movie the whole family could watch every Christmas season.\n",
      "this movie is so funny!!! i watch it outside of christmas time because i love it so much! fast shipping too!\n",
      "This is a timeless classic that you can enjoy each year. Even though you know whats coming next it is still funny.\n",
      "This is one of the best Christmas movies of all time. It is a staple in our house. Not for the young children.\n",
      "Love this movie, it is a tradition to watch it throughout the holiday season. Every time we watch it there if something new. Love it.\n",
      "Jeremiah Chechik brought me to this film.  His direction in \"Diabolique\" intrigued me.  What intrigued me more was the fact that this film,  like \"Joon\",  wasn't my kind of film.  The direction was fabulous.  The writing is insanely good.  All roads in this film lead to fun.  The cinematography doesn't take from the comedic skill in this film.  I adore E.G. Marshall,  his comedic/horror acting was/is grand in \"Creepshow\".  You'll also love the teaming of Diane Ladd and Doris Roberts.  Although they don't interact much, they feed off of each other to a great effect.  Chevy Chase is a comedic lovers dream.  Even Beverly D'Angelo is cast well here to compliment Chase.  The irritating and grotesque Randy Quaid is likeable,  yet leavable.  This film has it all for the funny lover.  This film works nevermind the time of year.\n",
      "this is the best movie I've seen in a long time. It is a holiday tradition in our household and has been since I was a little girl\n",
      "I needed something to cheer me up this holiday season.  National Lampoon's always works.  Also-- somehow my husband made it this long without seeing this movie-- problem solved.\n",
      "This is by far my favorite Christmas movie of all time and I think a lot of other people would agree with me on that! Full of a million and six memorable quotes, this movie is one that has stood the test of time when it comes to comedy classics! Can't go wrong with this one :)\n",
      "One of the most classic movies of all time!  I can watch this one over and over and love it every time!\n",
      "Love this movie! Makes me laugh every time! I've seen it a thousand times and its still super funny! Love it!\n",
      "Add this to your collection now, you won't be disappointed.Classic Chevy Chase that will be enjoyed for years to come.\n",
      "This movie has been around for a while, so it's nothing new.  The blue ray version is great. Pleased with purchase.\n",
      "I don't know anyone who doesn't like this movie.  It's one of our holiday favorites and a family tradition to watch between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I would recommend that everyone watch it at least once and just maybe, it will be a favorite and yearly tradition for your family too.\n",
      "One of the best holiday movies ever made. Great cast of actors. Its a family tradition to watch this during the holidays. I have a old VHS copy that is worn out, and a DVD. Now I have a Blue-ray copy. Can't wait to sit down with the family to watch it several times over the holiday. Last year I purchased the moose mugs to drink my eggnog in. When I decorate the house with lights my wife always says you would make Sparky proud.\n",
      "This is one of the best holiday movies ever! I watch it every year on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day!\n",
      "Must watch yearly, part of the holiday tradition. Amazon streaming quality is perfect, no need to find the DVD or even the VHS.\n",
      "Love this movie!  So many people in it that I can relate to my own family....lol.  Definately one to watch with the family.\n",
      "I don't know whether to call this movie a cult classic or a Christmas classic.  All I know for sure is my entire family, my sister's family, my brother's family, friends and neighbors, and even some people I don't know watch it over and over each year and can quote virtually every line of dialog.\n",
      "My family loves this movie. It is a tradition to watch it together. There are a couple of questionable spots with swearing but other than that it is fun and enjoyable.\n",
      "This movie is one of the best ever made, whether it be for Christmas or not. Its one of my all time favorite movies and I could watch it time after time. The comedy and movie quotes have stuck with me since day one and I know MANY of my friends who know right off the bat which movie its from..\n",
      "I needed to update my VHS tape with a DVD.  I would recommend updating to the DVD for obvious reasons in addition to the \"extra\" content in the newer format.\n",
      "Mary being the lingerie saleswoman dressed in red... In the Lampoon tradition of Christie Brinkley, the divine Nicolette Scorsese provided Chevy's Fantasy Babe interest in this excellent movie. The scene in which Randy Quaid's beer swilling Cousin Eddie transitions into Nicolette, standing on a diving board and teasing Clark, as she peels off a hot red swimsuit is just one of a thousand laughs in this utter classic.With a cast like this you can't really go wrong, and Brian Doyle Murray (Bill Murray's older brother) plays his Scrooge role flawlessly.Hard to pick out my favorite crazy scene, although the sequence in which Clark goes on an unwitting death ride in a super slippy saucer sled (hey, how about that alliteration?) is certainly a major thigh slapper.The Special Features are rather limited, and for some reason Chevy is absent from the track Commentary, which is entertainingly handled by Bev and Randy etc.Definitely a classic.\n",
      "How could you not love this movie? There're so many classic one liners in this movie that you'll be thankful you bought it.\n",
      "I absolutely love this movie! Makes me want to break out the ugly sweaters and moose mugs sooner than later. Now we’ve added the Blu-ray to our personal collection. Looking forward to seeing this movie again during the holidays!\n",
      "Always great to watch the holiday movies from childhood again as an adult.  This one is as good now as it was back then!.\n",
      "It's a classic. From making you laugh till you cry to some sweet nostalgia, it's just the best. Cousin Eddie rules!\n",
      "I always have to watch this movie at Christmas time. Its not Christmas time until I watch this movie.  Its so funny.  You can watch it every year and never stop laughing.\n",
      "Our family loves this movie and it is our tradition to watch it every Christmas. The lines and scenes never get old.\n",
      "It goes without saying that Christmas Vacation is one of the movies you will want to watch every year.  This is without a doubt the best of the Chevy Chase \"vacation\" movies.\n",
      "We watch rhis every Christmas and still laugh hysterically every time!  It's a family tradition!  We absolutely love this movie!!!\n",
      "It's a classic. I remember seeing this in high school with my best friend and rediscovering it as a parent.\n",
      "Who doesn't love the silly antics of Christmas Vacation?  I enjoy watching every Christmas season and still laugh at good ole Clark and cousin Eddie.\n",
      "This is the second one we have purchased. We wore the first one out. It is a family tradition to watch this Christmas Eve both in  Phoenix and in Asheville. It just never gets old. We wait for certain scenes and know the script by heart.\n",
      "Few areas not for \"family viewing\", but we count it a must-see every holiday season.  Overall, great fun, memorable characters and lines.\n",
      "This is my all time favorite Christmas comedy!  Clark's meltdown after receiving his Christmas bonus and his ride on the saucer sled will always be the most memorable scenes.\n",
      "This is one of our favorite Christmas traditions. Unfortunately some of Clark's antics hit a little close to home for me!\n",
      "I love this movie, we watch it every xmas.  The quality is good and I am glad I bought it.\n",
      "My whole family can p[ractically quote this movie word for word.  Even though we have watched it many, many times, we always enjoy it.\n",
      "What can I say?  I never get tired of this one!1.  My husband cracks up at the sledding scene every time!2.  Chevy Chase punching the plastic reindeer must be a guy thing because my husband punches things whenever he gets frustrated.3.  I never get tired of Cousin Eddie and Uncle Louis and Aunt Bethany!4.  If anyone is interested, here are two websites for the moose mugs. [...]  The Canadian moose mugs are  pricey but the melkmugs are around $[...] each and you get a discount  if you buy more than one.\n",
      "Best Christmas comedy ever!  You can watch it 100 times and still find it new and funny!  It is my favorite movie to ring in the holiday season.  I own it, download it, watch it on TV, any time of the year!\n",
      "I kept trying to find it all season on TV. Was so glad to find I could view it on amazon prime.\n",
      "This movie makes me laugh no matter how many times I've watched it. Great family movie for the Christmas Season.\n",
      "This is the perfect holiday family movie. I love watching it every year and will enjoy watching it for years to come.\n",
      "Can't watch it often enough!  We have pretty much memorized the dialogue and watch it several times during the holidays!\n",
      "Don't know what else to say. This is our favorite also. One of those that will always make you laugh.\n",
      "Our family has been watching this movie every year for 20 yrs!!  Just had to have the Aniversary Edition!!\n",
      "I can not believe how smooth and clear the streamed movie is. This one is a classic! We find some new little detail every time.\n",
      "Watched this movie with my family which we enjoyed very much.  Even though I'd seen this movie years before I forgot how funny the movie was.  Tissues were passed around to clean up the laughing tears.\n",
      "It wouldn't seem like Christmas if I did not get to watch this movie!I know people can hear me laughing outside....................\n",
      "This movie puts me in the Christmas mood every time I see it! Chevy Chase goes over the top on everything in order to have an old fashion Christmas...even if it kills him! Beverly D'Angelo is the patient wife, trying to rein in the little boy in her husband; Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki are the kids who though they look as if Dad is missing a few chestnuts, understand his zealous approach to the holidays. The in-laws are like all in-laws who come to spend the holidays with family...complaining. And Randy Quaid saves the day with his simpleton ways which compliment his brother-in-law's paranoia. Cuddle under a blanket, break out the egg nog, take the phone off the hook and lock the front door...you are about to see the 'mother' of all Christmas films!\n",
      "Christmas Vacation and A Christmas Story are definitely two movies to watch during the holiday season. I also didn't realize that was Johnny Galecki as Russ until this year!\n",
      "this is one of the funniest movies that i own.  a deffinate must have if you love to laugh and it is also fun for the family\n",
      "Great price for a classic movie.  We still laugh just as hard as we did the first time/ This has now become part of our Christmas tradition.\n",
      "I choose this rating because this is a classic who doesn't love the Griswalds.  Great hr an half spent laughing\n",
      "Even after nearly twenty years, this movie never fails to bring a laugh and a smile.  The memorable one-liners that you find yourself repeating are still funny today.The commentary reel was great, although I noticed once you turned it on, you couldn't turn it off until you ejected the DVD.  This is likely just a programming error, and not exactly end-of-the-world stuff.  Like others, I think it would have been much better had Mr. Chase decided to sign on and provide his take on the movie; nevertheless, the cast that did show up did an admirable job setting up the scenes and giving some juicy \"you wouldn't believe this but...\" background stories.The DVD itself looks good on my hi-def widescreen, although this is another film that could benefit from some TLC in the restoration department.Overall, you can't go wrong with this purchase if you enjoy holiday hijinks and laugh-a-minute one-liners that the Vacation series brings.\n",
      "Classic funny Christmas show.  Ease of ordering through my blueray was awesome.  Just sign in and click it was there.  The amazon prime is an awesome way to get free movies and free shipping on most items.  I love my prime service.\n",
      "This is my husband's favorite Christmas movie, top 10 overall!! It is required that we watch it every Christmas season!\n",
      "This is my favorite movie. The movie is fullscreen which is the only format I like to watch. The picture and sound quality was great. This movie is choc-full of funny characters that keep you laughing through the entire movie. I was so thrilled to find this movie in fullscreen.\n",
      "Great show, funny, wish the f bomb wasn't in it, I have little kids that just don't need to hear it.  But it's a great flick!\n",
      "This is simply the best Christmas movie ever, Its so funny from beginning to end ! I love the Griswold's\n",
      "This video works great and the quality is wonderful!  We love this movie and have watched it several times already!\n",
      "This is one of our favorite Christmas movies. We finally bought it and we are glad we did. It didn't take long to get the movie in the mail.\n",
      "One of my all-time favorite movies, I watch this all year round and it never gets old, I ALWAYS laugh!\n",
      "10,000 stars is not enough.It is the best holiday movie. Ever, really. It is. (I have to write this or they will not let me submit it.)\n",
      "Movie came in a timely fashion.  The movie was used and there were no problems with it at all.\n",
      "A hilarious Christmas movie that really allows the entire family to sit back and enjoy every moment.  National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a great movie to watch with the family during Christmas.Take my advice and just buy this movie!\n",
      "Great movie to get you in the holiday spirit.  A holiday classic up there with White Christmas and Its a Wonderful Life.\n",
      "I cant get enough of the cat frying and the Sh**ter's fulll.  We watch this all year long. Grand kids love it\n",
      "I try to watch this movie every year around Christmas time.  It's full of family humor and enough off-color material to satisfy.  The off color material is cloaked in adult nuance, so the kids can see this mostly.  The Eddie character is hilarious.  This is one of those movies you see more each time you watch it.  I give it a \"B\" but it's a strong B and doesn't get old quickly.  While third in the franchise, it recovers nicely from the missed opportunity of European Vacation.  The first one was almost a new genre, but is a little bit old these days being from the 1980s.  They are all still funny.  There was a final one that may or may not have been put out by the same people called Eddie's Island or something close - avoid that one.\n",
      "A Christmas Classic that requires watching every year. Chevy Chase is at his finest in this move and the supporting actors bring a warm smile.\n",
      "Glad I got it in blu-ray.  Colors are awesome and adds to the movie.  Must try it!  You will love it.\n",
      "One of the all-time great Christmas movies out there; Chevy Chase at his best!  This is a movie that my family watches over and over during the holidays.\n",
      "Giving it 5 stars because I've always loved this movie. It's hilarious. Not meant for kids though. One of, if not the funniest, Griswold movie.\n",
      "A true comedy classic and the best of the vacation series.  This film has made\"Griswold\" a verb at our house.\n",
      "A classic.  Required holiday viewing every year, especially if you are planning a family gathering.  Clark is  a living, breathing Mr. Magoo with a heart of gold.\n",
      "One of the funniest Christmas movies ever.  Enjoyed it the first time I watched it and laughed again this time.\n",
      "Best Christmas movie ever.Every Chevy Chase vacation movie is worth watching, but Christmas vacation is in a class of its own.\n",
      "I love this movie and thought I had it on VHS but could not find it, I looked at all the stores after Christmas and wasn't able to find it. Glad you had it.\n",
      "Love the movie and Chevy Chase.  It is a Christmas tradition in our house to watch Christmas Vacation along with other holiday movies we have.\n",
      "Good movie for the whole family, especially a few days leading to Christmas. Very entertaining, would recommend to folks with extended family members.\n",
      "If you have never seen this movie, it is a must see. There has never been one to match it. Great Christmas day movie.Amazon Unbox was easy to download and watch this movie. I even hooked up my computer to my TV and watched it on my 46 inch Widescreen TV.\n",
      "This is the second time I have purchased this movie.  The first time I loaned it to my sister and she just wouldn't give it back, so I had to order it again.  My husband and I love the Vacation movies and the Christmas one is our favorite one.  It just never gets old.\n",
      "A Classic to be sure......I found myself chuckling throughout this movie.A holiday favorite!It should be part of your collection.\n",
      "Does this movie even need a review?  It's Chevy Chase at his best as an uptight yuppie trying to carve out the best Christmas he can for his family.  What lies in the way, though, is the family.  Both sets of in-laws descend upon the house to the delight of no one.  Followed by lovely, lovely old Aunt Bethany with her dementia shows up with a live Christmas present.  And! no holiday would be complete without that deadbeat relative that shows up for the free food.  Cousin Eddy adds to the hilarity that is probably one of the worst family gatherings of all time.If you haven't seen this movie, crawl out from under your rock and do so!\n",
      "I saw this movie a while back for the first time and since then my family has purchased the movie, before that we rented it more times than I can remember. This movie definitly lives up to the quality of Vacation as it is completely hysterical! There are so many memorable lines in this movie youll be reciting them casually to friends and family. You gotta feel bad for Clark, why cant he ever have little fun with his family. The movie pinpoints just how stereotypical Christmas can be, and then shows how it can be if everything goes wrong. Great cast and Chevy Chase leads the group in a wonderful movie thatll have you rolling out of your seat. True classic and I urge you to pick it up!\n",
      "We've been watching this for ten years and love it. We know most of the lines and reference it often, as do a lot of people. Great Holiday tradition for us.\n",
      "Great movie, always funny and gives you that warm fuzzy fealing once Griswald finally figures out how to get the Christmas Lights working. :-)\n",
      "I love all of Chevy Chase's movies. I grew up with the Griswald's and think they are hilarious. It is just funny the things they try to do together as a family.\n",
      "One of the best christmas comedys ever.I watch this every year at christmas time.A must see.If you've never seen it,check it out.\n",
      "everyone who has ever had there family crowed in for christmas or was look to for making christmas merry will love this its funny warm and a must see for the holidays\n",
      "For an 80s movie they did great with the HD.  It looks good on my HD TV.\n",
      "this was a gift for my brother in law.  he loves it!!  the best xmas movie ever; great price too!!!\n",
      "Got this film for a good price. It's a classic at Christmas time. I can't say much more than that.\n",
      "I love this movie! I have watched it at least once every Christmas since it came out. It is on my favorites list.\n",
      "A wonderful movie. The Griswold family antics are a joy to watch, and there's even a moral. A must watch Christmas movie.\n",
      "I wish every year, I had no memory of this movie so I could experience again and again as if it were the first time I ever saw it.  Absolute truth!  If you have never seen it and are going to see it for the first time I am completely envious of you!  Merry Christmas!\n",
      "Comedy gold. We can all relate to some part of the movie. Sure to put a smile on your face.\n",
      "I love this movie and I have owned it on VHS since it first came out. That copy is the copy that I have watched every year (yes I still have VHS). But I saw this year that this was out on Blu-ray so I wanted to get it because it was time to replace the VHS copy. This copy of the movie doesn't look any better than my on VHS which when you think about it is terrible. Anyone who has bought a vintage film on Blu-ray with the remaster done from the original film knows how amazing they can look. This looks like the Blu-ray was made right from the VHS copy! If you see a copy of it you will see right in the very first shot on the title screen that the stutters (jsut a little) just like old VHS tapes did. If you want the movie because you don't have it then you have no choice but if you already have a decent copy don't waste your money.\n",
      "Say what you will about Chevy Chase; he can play that goofy character,Clark Griswald to perfection. Cousin Eddie is one of my favorite movie characters of all time. Our family watches this movie yearly at Christmas time. It gets us in the spirit of laughter.\n",
      "Keeps your interest, cousins and aunts characters add punch!  Neighbors interaction doesn't add a lot to the overall outcome of several scenes.\n",
      "I enjoy all of Chevy Chase movies. In my opinion, this was one of his best comedy's & it will make you rock with laughter!\n",
      "Christmas Vacation is a necessary part of our Christmas tradition.  We have watched it so many times we have worn out the VHS tape, so purchased the DVD from Amazon.  It would not be Christmas around our house without it. It is one of the best and funniest \"Vacation\" movies made.  We love it because it reminds us of our family nut-cases and all the headaches that come with the holidays.  The soundtrack is full of all our favorite Christmas tunes, the comedy is always funny and the cast just works so well together.  A must see!\n",
      "Hilarious Hilarious Hilarious! This movie is an annual Christmas tradition at our home and the video quality was excellent. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Hard to believe that such a crazy movie about Christmas can be so true to life.  Enjoyable.  As you get older youappreciate it more.\n",
      "Great Christmas movie! We watch it every year while we are putting up the Christmas tree and decorating the house.\n",
      "This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  I just watched it tonight and I notice something new every time!  It's a great holiday tradition!\n",
      "Love this movie! I've seen it a bunch of times and it still makes me laugh just as hard every time!!\n",
      "FOR  MANY  YEARS  IT  WAS  A  TRADITION  IN  MY  FAMILY  TO  WATCH  THIS ON  CHRISTMAS EVE.  U  CANT  GET  ENOUGH OF  THIS  MOVIE.  ITS  LAUGHTER  FROM  BEGINNING  TO  END.  IT  SHOWS  CHRISTMAS  REALLY  IS  ABOUT  FAMILY  AND  NOT  PRESENTS.  ONCE  MY  DAUGHTER  IS  OLD ENOUGH  TO  UNDERSTAND  THINGS  I  WILL  MAKE  THIS  MOVIE  OUR  CHRISTMAS EVE  TRADITION.  THIS  MOVIE  IS  APPROPRIATE  FOR  ALL  AGES.  ANYWAY  JUST  BUY  IT  FOR  YOUR  COLLECTION  U  WONT  REGRET  IT.\n",
      "great comedy - very funny. One off the best movies to watch during the Christmas season - the making of a season tradition.\n",
      "Classic we love this movie. We watch this every year and know almost every word. Sick Huh!Recommend to everyone.\n",
      "Love this movie. It's a Christmas classic!  We cut the cord so collecting special Christmas movies for the season and keeping them on rotation is better than flipping through channels looking for seasonal shows\n",
      "Chevy Chase is a must for Christmas holiday viewing. Make sure you ass this to the family collection for hit down fun during the season.\n",
      "Christmas vacation ranks right up there with the all-time best Christmas movies.  Chevy Chase and Beverly D'angelo reprise their rolls as the Griswolds in this third \"vacation movie.  Also back is Randy Quaid as hick cousin Eddie.Clark Griswold just wants to give his family a great old fashioned Christmas but typically goes over the top on everything.  This movie demonstrates all the bad things about Christmas...dealing with family, shopping, decorating, etc...It all makes for one funny, but even a bit touching knowing how much Clark loves his family and does give them that great Christmas in the end.EVerything works here.  Great character actors including E.G. marshall, and Diane ladd in roles as two of the Griswolds parents.The Special edition is nothing to write home about.  All you get is an original trailer and a commentary track with Quiad, DeAngelo, and a few others, but no Chase.\n",
      "BOUGHT THIS AS XMAS PRESENT FOR A FRIENDS FAMILY. THIS IS A MUST HAVE ALL YEAR ROUND,  NOT JUST AT XMAS SEASON.\n",
      "Best Christmas movie ever made. This is a timeless classic that kicks off the Christmas season in my family year after year.\n",
      "Classic American family Christmas movie.  Clarke Griswold embodies the sentimental American family man, complete with his ambitions and complexities.  Julia Louis-Dreyuss plays the yuppie counterpoint to the Griswold family.\n",
      "This is my favorite Christmas movie of all time. Really funny! Blu-ray was a great price and in great condition\n",
      "This is one of my favorite christmas movies . We watch it every year on Thanksgiving. Love how clear on blueray.\n",
      "Very funny movie. Christmas Classic and family tradition. My family and I have watched this every year for at least a decade.\n",
      "This is one of the funniest christmas movies that I watch every year. I also love Scrooged. But this movie is funny from start to end.\n",
      "Always loved this movie.  Being able to enhance it with Blue Ray makes it even better!  Classic movies being enhanced by today's technology brings them new life.\n",
      "We watch this every year and laugh at how this typifies the good 'ol fun family Christmas.  Always gets us all laughing!\n",
      "Love, love, love this movie.  Seen umpteen times and never get tired of it.  We like to have it playing while we decorate the tree.\n",
      "A must watch for me every year!  A Christmas Classic which is fun for the whole family.  Who doesn't love the Griswolds?!?! :-)\n",
      "We love this classic. Always a great time to watch the Griswalds. If you haven't seen this you must soon. It doesn't need to be Christmas to enjoy the Griswald's celebrate the holidays.\n",
      "This is a Christmas tradition for us and now we can watch it when we want and not have to search to find when it is showing.  Our time is now when we choose.  Great comedic tradition to the holidays!!\n",
      "Great fun, year after year. We look forward to watching this one during the holidays. This movie epitomizes the holidays for so many families.\n",
      "It is just not the Christmas season without this movie.  Not sure who is going by reviews on this one.  Does anyone not know it?\n",
      "This is simply the very best modern Christmas movie. Yes the classics must get their due respect, but Clark Griswold takes a back seat to no one. A must see movie!\n",
      "IS THERE A QUESTION WHY THIS IS THE SINGLE-GREATEST CHRISTMAS MOVIE OF ALL TIME.  CHEVY CHASE.  RANDY QUAID. DONE. JUST WATCH IT\n",
      "Trust me, you'll love it!  After watching this movie over 20 times, it still makes me laugh so hard my eyes water!\n",
      "Christmas vacation is a classic. My family and I have been watching it each christmas for years now and it has become a tradition for us. I can recite almost all the lines by heart and it always brings a smile to our faces to see it each year!\n",
      "This movie is a true Christmas classic and the best National Lampoons movie.  A true MUST SEE!  The cast in this movie are perfectly fitted for there rolls.\n",
      "It was a fun movie to watch, on Christmas eve. Very cute and funny, goes to show that family comes first.\n",
      "I've long been a fan of the \"Vacation\" films, as well as National Lampoon movies in general.  \"Christmas Vacation\" is the third-best Lampoon movie and the second-best of the \"Vacation\" series.  Chevy Chase returns as Clark Griswold Jr., who is this time set on making this year's Christmas one to remember.  He did it.Chase is at best and funniest.  Beverly D'Angelo returns as Ellen Griswold, with the Griswold kids now portrayed by Johnny Galecki and a young Juliette Lewis.  Diane Ladd, John Randolph, E.G. Marshall, and Doris Roberts are the grandparents.  Randy Quaid is hilarious in his return as Cousin Eddy.  Brian Doyle-Murray is, as always, great, as Clark's angry, cold-hearted boss.  Nicholas Guest and Julia Louis-Dreyfus play Clark's rich, stuck-up neighbors.The soundtrack is actually very good.  It's filled with some great Christmas tunes, along with a good score by the amazing Angelo Badalamenti.John Hughes' script is terrific.  We can believe what the Griswold family is going through because we've gone through it too.  But Hughes' script isn't all laugh-out-loud comedy; at it's heart, it's a message about a caring father who tries to make the best Christmas for his family.  There's one scene where Clark can't get the Christmas lights to work, and all the family members say comforting things to him; I thought it was actually a pretty moving scene.\"Christmas Vacation\" is great, hilarious Christmas fun.  If you're looking for a new movie this Christmas season, give this one a shot.\n",
      "I'm a fan of Chevy, and as normal he's funny as all get out, have seen almost all his movies\n",
      "In this third Vacation movie the Griswold's are on Christmas Vacation but are staying home for the holidays and Clark wants to make it be a Christmas to remember. Will he succeed? Watch and find out!\n",
      "These were purchased as gifts for replacement of VHS copies and for a person that had never seen it (can you believe it)!!!  We love this movie and watch it over and over during the Christmas season.  As a matter of fact my wife and I swear that our Christmas this year mirrored Griswolds.  We cut down our tree from the same location that we have for the last few years and for some reason the week before Christmas you could not even breathe on it without it loosing needles, so we had to go out and get a new tree, the hooter/hotter happened and we both just started laughing, the list could go on and on but at least we enjoyed our Christmas together watching this movie about 7 different times.  Love it!\n",
      "Love the movie. Great fun. Will watch it every year. We have seen it several times before now we can watch it when we want.\n",
      "Cousin Eddy Steals the Show.The back and forth banter in the dialog is priceless.A must for Holiday Movie Buffs.\n",
      "We watch this every year, and every year we laugh and laugh, in my opinion this is one of the best Christmas movies of all time!  I just bought this on Blu-ray and it is crystal clear making it EVEN BETTER than last year!  A+++\n",
      "Chevy Chase was 'almost' up-staged by the incredibly ridiculous character played by Randy Quaid.  I admit to laughing so hard my sides hurt...but then again the likeable crazy characters in this film that get together for Christmas are hysterical in their own right!This is certainly not a family movie...under 17 would be a no-no, in my estimation.I really loved this hilarious and joyous Ntional Lampoon Christmas Vacation...I absolutely recommend this to adults looking for a fast moving, very funny movie!\n",
      "We watdh this each Christmas time. Our old one started skipping (VCR) I ordered this DVD to replace it and  it is what it was represented to be and I had it right away at a reasonable cost.Thanks for the good service. What did we do before Amazon. ☺Tony Crump\n",
      "Watch this every year. One of the best Christmas movies ever. This one never gets old. \"You surprised to see us Clark?\"\n",
      "SO great to see this title on Amazon Prime, we as a family love sitting down to watch the Griswold's Christmas disaster - Hilarity ensues, and to think of it : Any Christmas drama by the normal dysfunctional family is a cake-walk compared to the Characters' family in this funny and festive Christmas Classic.\"Halleluja, Holy S***, where's the Tylenol!!?\" - Clark Griswold\n",
      "This movie is so Hillarious and it's a great movie for the entire family to sit around and watch over the Holidays !\n",
      "One survives perfectly well without the other but this was probably one of the best sequel films ever made.  Just as funny if not more so the the original Vacation film.\n",
      "Classic Christmas movie that always makes me laugh!  Makes your family seem \"normal.\"  A must watch movie every holiday season!\n",
      "Our family has watched it about every year since it came out on video and we never get tired of it.  It has become a holiday tradition in our house.  Still a riot after all these years.\n",
      "This movie is so hilarious.  The Clark Griswold character is always good for a laugh.  Love the Manny the Moose mugs.  I know someone who received them as a wedding gift.\n",
      "This is movie is classic comedy! Its not Christmas with out watching this at least once during the Christmas Season! Highly recommended to those who need a chuckle to a hardy laugh.\n",
      "One of the best Christmas movies available.  This should be on your list even if it is Christmas in July!\n",
      "Fun Christmas movie.  Haven't seen this one in years but it is fun to see again.  A Christmas tradition.  Thumbs up.\n"

      "I bet your Christmas plans never quite work out right. The Griswalds'plans never work out either. Clark wants an old-fashioned familyChristmas. Somewhere between Cousin Eddie showing up and the treecatching fire, everything goes wrong. The Griswalds are just as funnyas they are in the other National Lampoon vacation movies (skip VegasVacation). The best character of all has to be Randy Quaid's 'Cousin Eddie'.He and Chevy Chase are at their best in this movie. This movie ishilarious from start to finish.This is one of the funniest Christmas movies ever made; actually, it'sprobably one of the funniest movies ever made, period. I watch it atleast once or twice a year, and so does everyone else in my family.Christmas isn't Christmas at my house if nobody quotes Clark or Eddieat least once. Everyone has at least one favorite line. If you'restarting your collection of Christmas movies, make this one of yourfirst buys.\n",
      "A great addition to my Christmas movie library. It is my favorite of the \"N L Vacation\" series of movies.\n",
      "Love Chevy Chase. Randy Quade is excellent. Need to do a sequel. Eddie and the rest of the Griswolds are at it again.\n",
      "I just love this movie what else is there to say funny funny funny  always a family favorite if you have never watched it try it you will enjoy\n",
      "Clark will crack you up one side and down the other!I love to watch this movie every holiday season... really puts me in the mood.If I were you, I'd get all the 'Vacation' movies  : ))Don't forget to check out the 'Fletch' movies too.\n",
      "Classic Christmas movie with the Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid.  This is a must see if you the over the top (Vacation) movies.  I do.\n",
      "Bought this for myself. Favorite Christmas movie we watch every year.\n",
      "This is still a holiday classic. I've watched it several times and I still enjoy it. This is a great comedy for the whole family.\n",
      "It's National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation...I mean, how could you not own this...Everyone should have a copy to enjoy year round.\n",
      "A classic movie that shows the reality of the Christmas season. During the month of December this movie is on almost everyday.\n",
      "A classic Christmas time movie.  We watch it every Christmes time.  Of all the Vacation movies it is the best movie.\n",
      "This is a classic movie that my family has to see at Christmas time.  This movie has it all, even a squirrel to brighten your day.\n",
      "The original Lampoon Vacation is a close second.  But I have seen Christmas Vacation at least 100 times and it never gets old.  Also, it's my favorite Christmas holiday movie.  It should have its own marathon.\n",
      "The greatest movie made with Chevy Chase. You get a real familyfeeling when you watch this movie and makes your Christmas, how dark it is, much brighter. The greatest laugh of this movie is cousin Eddy. \"don't you  fall in love with it, 'cause we're taking it with us when we leave here  next month\"\n",
      "Hilarious! Them National Lampoon films never get old. This one is a nice piece to own for the holidays. Those were the days when Christmas trees couldn't fit in living rooms, Christmas dinners were nice and dry and crunchy like that turkey, and Christmas lights were hung all over the house! A true classic!\n",
      "All of the expected mishaps for a Lampoon movie, this movie is hilarious! We watch it every Christmas and a few times throughout the year!\n",
      "Awesome movie, carrying on a family tradition full of laughter! Good for all ages, great for all occasions, good times!\n",
      "As everyone knows at this point, this film is a fine Christmas classic that deserves to be in any collection and viewed every year during the Holidays with the family. The Blu Ray upgrade in picture quality is worth it.But, skip the Ultimate Collector's Edition and just stick with the single disk purchase. The extra items such as the coasters, the fake snow, the santa hat and the moose cup are all low quality crap. The Marty Moose mug, which could have been THE item to have in this set is so small you could barely stick your pinky finger in the opening. the tin package for the set is nice but only takes up space on the shelf unless you can find another holiday use for it.\n",
      "This is one my favorite all time Christmas movies.  I had the vhs version and wanted to upgrade to dvd.  I would recommend it to everyone.\n",
      "One of the al time BEST holiday movies to have in your personal collection! Then add more lights to your house for Christmas.\n",
      "Christmas Vacation is the funniest Christmas movie I've ever seen. I have probably watched this movie 50 times through the years, and I laugh myself silly every time. We use the tag lines quite often in our home when we just want to crack each other up. \"If you need me, I'll be upstairs alseep.\" \"Holy ***t, where's the Tylenol.\" \"Don't throw me down, Clark.\" \"Tis the season to be Merry.\" Classic comedy!\n",
      "I can't even count the number of times I watched this movie over the holidays.  I even love watching when it isn't the holiday.  It is just to wacked for words.\n",
      "This is a great oldie but it's still a goody. His point of veiws are stupid but so funny. It's worth the watch you'll never forget it and will want to own it.\n",
      "You cannot go wrong with this Christmas classic. Chevy Chase provides laugh after laugh no matter how many times you watch it.\n",
      "A great all around Christmas movie! Funny and entertaining till the end, one that I watch every holiday season. watch it.\n",
      "A hilarious Christmas movie that has now become a tradition each year to watch.Chevy Chase is at his best in this movie.\n",
      "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a classic Christmas movie.  We watch it every Christmas, and it remains a favorite among all family members.  It is the best in the National Lampoon's collection.  Highly recommended for the whole family.\n",
      "Had to get this classic in blu ray.  It is a must watch every year during the holidays.  The quality is much better than standard DVD.\n",
      "This was an amazingly funny comedy with a punch line. I highly recommend this film to everyone view for Christmas.\n",
      "This has brought many, many laughs and smiles to my family through the years. Great movie to have and get anyone in the mood for some Christmas family fun! ;)\n",
      "Thats right, it's that time of year again, the holidays. In order to keep up the spirit, I'm trying to think of all the best Holiday Fare I can come up with. Well, it just ain't Christmas in my family until we watch some NATIONAL LAMPOONS CHRISTMAS VACATION. My folks took me to see this in the theater back in '89, and its been tradition ever since. The movie is f'in hillarious, my mom will tell you that it's the best of the whole VACATION series, well if it isn't it certainly is a close two. Packed to the rim with hillarious one liners all around, this movie is always a blast. Hell, I even know a family that doesn't celebrate Christmas, and THEY watch this one every year. So... when you gots the whole family over this year and it's getting tough remember this movie.\"We're gonna press on, and we're gonna have the hap, hap, happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap-danced with Danny F**KING Kaye. And when Santa squeezes his fat white ass down that chimney tonight, he's gonna find the jolliest bunch of assh*les this side of the nuthouse!\"\n",
      "Our family loves this Christmas movie.  I guess that shows how twisted we are!\n",
      "My kids and I watch this every year around Thanksgiving to kick off our holiday season.  Lots of laughs and reminders of what is important in life.\n",
      "The Chevy Chase lampoons are by far the best, and this one is just as funny as National Lampoons Vacation.\n",
      "I'm a child of the 80's. It's just a really funny Christmas movie. If your a fan of Chevy Chase you will love the movie. It is a corny movie, but it's supposed to be.\n",
      "My favorite of the Vacation movies.  If you enjoyed the others, you'll love this one!Bonus - Julia Louis Dreyfus as the uptight yuppie neighbor!\n",
      "A Christmas shouldn't go by without turning on this ole classic. Chevy really shines supported by a wonderful cast, especially cousin Eddie.\n",
      "This movie never gets old. A great, funny, Christmas Classic.  I didn't have it in DVD - I had a VHS tape of this movie that I have watched for years. It was time to upgrade! The quality is so much better in DVD format.\n",
      "Great movie! Snots the dog, unidentified lip fungus, and classy relatives from Kansas make this movie timeless!  We watch it every year.\n",
      "LOVED THE MOVIE, IT WAS AS I REMEMBERED IT AND WILL WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. FANTASTIC AND CLEAR.\n",
      "Everyone should know most of the lines in this movies by heart by now! If you have never seen it, what are you waiting on??  This is right there with a Christmas Carol on best all-time classic Christmas movies!\n",
      "Let's just say that this has become as much a part of our household as the Holy Bible (not really), but HEY this is it! My family thinks i wrote most of this, and my 26 year old son still remembers what I was wearing, and what we had to eat at the consession stand when we saw this in it's first week at the theater back in December 1989! I start quoting lines in about October, and the big question is how early we will \"pop it in\" the DVD player. That it is Clark-that it is!-my new favorite line after my best friend quoted it for me! Okay I'm just having fun-I just hope I get that Christmas bonus!\n",
      "I've loved this movie since i first saw it when i was around 14 or so in 1989, since then every single Christmas its on about 300 times on different channels. Chevy Chase was at his peak then slowly disappeared, while Eddy (Randy Quaid) stole the show and went on to do much bigger things. I wish they would not even have done Vegas Vacation being that it was the least funny and just down right stupid at times. This is the ultimate Christmas movie for every family to enjoy, but does it need to be on Blu Ray? No. I went to a friends house who had some movies, most of which i had already seen on blu ray, so i thought to myself well i'm in a laughing mood so why not watch this on Blu Ray. Even his nice 55 inch LED Samsung the picture just looked, well, normal, and fuzzy as well. I never really did understand why they would put movies like this in HD anyways, TV is fine, but a disc no. Most people don't care to see movies like The Notebook, Hangover, Grown Ups, 50 First Dates and those sorts of movies because its just unnecessary. I've never watched a normal film and thought wow, look at the sweat on there faces, look how vibrant their clothes look, how real that conversation looks!! Blu Ray should be put aside for action, horror, nature films or sci fi, most everything else is pretty pointless. Oh well, the movie is great and the funniest of all the franchise, my next would be European Vacation, then the original. Don't waste money though when you can just turn it on this Christmas and catch it 20 times a day before hand. I was just in the mood to watch it, but was not impressed with the quality at all. Incredible movie!! Poor Transfer.By the way....Graacceee shee passst awwayy yearrsss ago. \"They want you to say grace, THEEE BLESSSSINGGGG!!!\"..Classic:)\n",
      "One of the best Christmas movies of all time, and you catch so much more in hd not to mention a large tv :)\n",
      "great vacations movie just like the first one. love Chevy Chase in this move. best scene is in the attic\n",
      "Classic Christmas movie to watch during the holidays. I'll probably watch it again before Christmas.  I love the Griswolds!  Happy Holidays!\n",
      "A christmas classic in all it's blu-ray splendor. This is a nice compliment to any movie collection, one that is sure to be enjoyed every year at christmas time. Enables the viewer to make out fine details such as brands, prices, and other small detail that is often missed in lower quality versions. Gives older viewers something to reminisce about. Well worth it.\n",
      "who's ever put christmas into a better and more realistic light than the makers of this film? it is a masterpiece!\n",
      "I love this x mas movie. It got here in time as always and right b4 x mas day. I must have watched it 5 times already. thanks guys as always\n",
      "This is the best christmas movie ever made. Good for the family as it's not too vulgar but still pretty funny\n",
      "This is one of the best christmas movies ever,very pleased\n",
      "Funny movie with great humor sometimes leaning toward crude. Cat lovers will not like the part with the cat getting fried. Some sexual and drug references used and not necessary to make the movie better. All in all it was enjoyable.\n",
      "A family tradition! My family and I watch this EVERY YEAR, a must for the collection! Classic humor, good fun for the holidays!\n",
      "Great movie. My family and I watch this movie every Thanksgiving evening to kick off the Christmas season. A Holiday classic.\n",
      "It was disappointing to find out that this DVD is not being sold in stores at the present time, so I was thrilled to find it available through Amazon.  Thank you so much for your very prompt service and for the excellent condition of this product.  William Byers\n",
      "Looked every where for this movie, glad we found it. You should add this one to your collection . Great movie\n",
      "Chevy Chase is at his best as he formulates his ultimate Christmas in his mind and everything that can go wrong does go wrong. Ultimately, he provides a great holiday for his family, as well as the in-laws. It doesn't matter how many times my family and I watch this movie, we laugh our tails off every time. This is another one of my family's must-watch movies around the holidays!\n",
      "A must see at Christmas time.  Never pass up a chance to visit Christmas with the griswolds.  It is the best of the series.\n",
      "Easily one of my favorite movies of all time, since Netflix doesn't offer this year round I needed to purchase this myself.  Blu-Ray quality is amazing, as always.\n",
      "Super Funny with a real perspective on the human race at the holiday time of year. Have to own for yourself.\n",
      "This is indeed a Christmas classic DVD movie. Everyone, with any sense of humor, needs to watch this every Christmas. Then you will realize those crazy family relation you have aren't as bad as you thought!\n",
      "This is one of the most hilarious Christmas movies I have ever watched. I highly recommend this DVD to spread holiday cheer it will make you laugh.\n",
      "got this for a gift and from what I have heard, they thought it was funny.  Have always enjoyed the national lampoon's movies.\n",
      "I have loved this dvd for many years.  Our family watched it every Christmas Eve for as long as it has been out.  We never tire of it.My husband passed away in 1990, but my son carried on the tradition  He passed away from multiple myeloma on 12/21/12 and the family has not watched it for 2 years.  However, my purchase of the dvd assures that next Christmas Eve I will be sure and watch it and remember Christmas's past.Wilma\n",
      "I love this movie!  My family watches it every year and still laughs hysterically at cousin Eddie and his RV\n",
      "I have been watching this movie every year, for 12 years now. Each year, it makes me laugh and puts me in the spirit of Christmas. I also watch it just to hear Ray Charles \"That Spirit of Christmas\" song. The best!\n",
      "This is the funniest movie. Chevy Chase is always hilarious. This DVD seems to work fine and I am happy with this purchase.\n",
      "This movie became a hit with our family the first time we saw it.  We now consider this one of the movies we watch when we are together for the holidays.  A movie that is entertaining.\n",
      "This one is a classic full of memorable quotes that are still used to this day.  If you haven't seen this one then you should make it a part of your Christmas must see list!\n",
      "As always Chevy Chase makes us laugh. This was a replacement for a vhs copy we have had for years!\n",
      "One of the better Christmas movies, if a bit crude in spots. Memorable. Excellent acting by Randy Quaid and Brian Doyle-Murray.\n",
      "A Christmas classic that the whole family can enjoy.  A little over the top slap-stick comedy, but over all it's great fun.\n",
      "Chevy Chase at his funniest!  This movie will have you rolling on the floor laughing! Beverly D'Angelo and Randy Quaid add to the hilarity!\n",
      "Who doesn't love Christmas Vacation? I even went to see it at a theater that was playing a blu-ray version just to see it on the big screen. This movie is a classic and also another movie my family watch every Christmas as tradition.  We can copy the movie word for word, and often find ourselves acting out certain scenes lol.  This is one that will never get old, and will be on our TVs every Christmas while we wrap presents and prepare Christmas dinner and welcome family members.\n",
      "This is a great movie with plenty of laughs for the whole family.  I highly recommend buying this one on DVD.\n",
      "This show is so funny, I almost know the entire script from beginning to end I have watched and laughed at it so many times.\n",
      "This is a classic Christmas movie that looks so much better on blue ray than dvd.My family loves it.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite Hoildays movie and it look great in Blue ray I recommend this to all family with young children We used to watch this as a family and my kids are adults now and this is one that they watch with there own kids now\n",
      "Hilarious! Cousin Eddie's line \"and don't forget the rubber sheets and the gerbils\" is classic! By far the best of the \"Vacation\" series. Could have done without the lone \"f\" word however.\n",
      "grate, funny, it keeps you warm in hearth. Chavy Chase is a great actor, aways makes me laugh.  When I am down, depress, I watch one of his movies.\n",
      "Always a great movie of family, humor and about doing the right thing in the end because of family values which mean so much for a father to achieve for his family.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite movies. I had the movie in video format, but being in dvd makes it much better. less room to take up. And as always very, very funny.\n",
      "Want some laughs about christmas? If you do, don't burn your tree! Watch this today, and see them burn theirs!\n",
      "Seriously, how can you not like Christmas Vacation?  For the price it was impossible to beat.  I look forward to the holiday deals next year!\n",
      "The more you see this film, the harder and longer you will laugh. Just thinking about this film makes me begin to shake with uncontrollable laughter. This film defines silly, and it does so in such unexpected ways that even the most taciturn among you will break into uproarious fits of child-like giggling.\n",
      "You can keep Rudolph, Frosty, and the Grinch.  This is the movie I pull out every Christmas.  It's both touching and hilarious.  The scene with the squirrel has me rolling on the floor no matter how many times I see it.  Make this a holiday tradition for your family!\n",
      "Four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are sent to live with the professor in a mansion. When they're playing hide and seek, they discover a world that they never thought existed. Here we enter Narnia-where mythical creatures talk and where a cruel white witch reigns over the land. She has a spell to keep it always winter-but never Christmas. No one can defeat the white witch. Except-there is a prophecy- that if 2 sons of Adam and 2 daughters of Eve sit at the throne at Cair Paravel, the white witch will be defeated. Can it be done? The only hope Narnia has is for the four children to sit at the throne. Led by Aslan-the creator of the land-who will come out victorious?I really enjoyed watching this movie. Not only is it full of great special effects and plenty of action, but it's filled with lots of symbolism. The books are written by C.S Lewis-a Christian author. In his books Lewis put in tons and tons of symbolism. And the movie follows it.Now for the effects. This movie is chalkfull of effects. The Lion-Aslan actually looks real compared to the earlier Narnia movies. The battle sequence is great. The scenery is great, too. (it was filmed in New Zealand) So if you like action and adventure, and have read the books-then step into Narnia-where everything comes to life!\n",
      "\"The Chronicles of Narnia:  The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" presents the C.S. Lewis fantasy classic very well.  (The story takes place during World War II in England where Lucy, the youngest of four siblings [Peter, Edmund, and Susan] stumbles upon a magical kingdom named Narnia in the back of a wardrobe of a professor's mansion while playing hide-and-go-seek.)  The children find themselves in a world of animals, fauns, and other mythical beasts who are captive to a witch's spell casting a perennial winter upon Narnia.  They find themselves in an adventure to help free Narnia from the icy grip of the White Witch, Jadis, and her endless winter. (It is a fantasy much like \"The Lord of the Rings\" with Christian allegory, but with enough appeal to please a wider audience.)Fortunately, the technical development for the movie lives up to our expectations. Many comparisons have been made to Jackson's \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, but, while \"Narnia\" owes a great deal to the former's technical excellence (mainly from director Andrew Adamson's experience with \"Shrek\"), \"Narnia\" stands on its own.  Luckily for C.S. Lewis fans, the making of this movie is very timely.  The acting, which has sometimes been undermined, is good all around.  While Tilda Swinton is aptly given praise for her role as Jadis, the White Witch, the child actors deserve accolades for their natural portrayals as the young sojourners to the Narnia world.  (Their emotional range from sibling rivalry to genuine astonishment is good throughout.) The movie is also true to the book in content and  meaning without being watered down.  It presents an absorbing story and a gripping adventure.The movie is rated PG, but it shouldn't scare away too many viewers.  There are some frightening moments, and, indeed, the violence, while not too graphic, will be at least a notch up from cowboy and Indian matinee movies from the fifties. (Some five-year-old viewers survived the jolts at the movie theatre better than this reviewer, and the reader can always control the volume at home.) This movie is great entertainment for people of all ages.\n",
      "I really enjoyed this movie. I brought it to my Bible study group and shared it with them, they loved it also\n",
      "When I was just a little kid I fell in love with the cartoon version of this story.  The movie followed the cartoon version very closely and it was amazing to see it brought to life.  I was teary eyed through most of the movie, it really moved me. Some of the mystical creatures gave me a chuckle because they looked silly and it almost seemed like watching Xena...but i thought the scenery and especially the music was wonderful.  You really get wrapped up in it and I think I liked the beautiful white snow instead of the lush green.  So, anyway, if you did watch the cartoon version you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "Of course the movie is wonderful, but don't get it from here.  It will not come with the booklet that it says is enclosed.  In the end it was a big mess for me.  Buy it somewhere else.\n",
      "At the Library where I work, we can't keep the Chronicles of Narnia series on the shelf fast enough. A perennial favourite with the kids, the books have certainly proved the test of time and become much loved. The film of the first book in the series is certainly worth looking at, and unlike the Harry Potter novels, you don't have to be an aficionado of the books to understand the story.Not having read the books though, I can still appreciate that the film remains faithful to the book in tone and imagery, and it's solid, reasonably close cinematic approximation of C.S. Lewis's books, even if the film is a little overlong and a trifle dull in spots.  It's a lovingly rendered sword and sorcery epic that just needed a trimming in a few spots, yet it is appealing, mostly because the startling visual effects don't overwhelm the impact of the actual story.Narnia is indeed a magical, surreal world into which four lovely children stumble. Animals talk, centaurs and satyrs romp, a magnificent, all-powerful lion named Aslan pads through dispensing deeper meaning, and then there's an absolute tour-de-force performance by Tilda Swinton as the machiavellian, Jadis, the White Witch, who will stop at nothing to keep her icy empire intact.Peter the eldest (William Moseley), Susan the priss (Anna Popplewell), Edmund the sour (Skandar Keynes), and the cute Lucy  (Georgie Henley) are packed off by their mother to the country to escape the London blitz. They are to stay with a distant relative (Jim Broadbent, eccentrically bewigged). One rainy Sunday afternoon Lucy idly wanders into that wardrobe and stumbles into the snow where she meets Tumnus (James McAvoy), a faun.Edmund follows a short time later, where he bumps into Jadis and is immediately seduced by her promise of endless hot chocolates and Turkish delights. All the children eventually make it over and are beguiled by this world where beavers talk and where they are forced to come to terms with the fact that they are the four humans who will free the realm from Jadis's icy grip.Admittedly some of the CGI effects don't quite work - particularly in the middle section - and there could have been more thought put into some of the smaller details, like having Mr. Tumnus's ears move for instance. But the marvelous Ms. Swinton as the wicked White Queen, more than makes up for its shortcomings. A woman of formidable talents, she totally embodies the attributes of an obsessed fanatic with a cold interest in cruelty.Much has been made about the religious and mythological aspects of the story and the conflict between civilization and chaos. I didn't get much of that here. If there were any references to Christian martyrdom in the books, they have certainly been glossed over in the film. Most of what you see on screen, while paying lip service to moral ideas, is pretty much about war and chaos, the film opening with devastating scenes of the blitz, and then ending with the ultimate battle for the control of Narnia.As the children gain ground against the witch, Narnia begins to thaw, and they become ever more confident and determined to save the realm - Peter gets a sword, Susan gets a bow and arrow, a dagger for Lucy. And the scary battle scene at the end is as good as any that you will see in the Lord of the Rings. It almost becomes medieval, with the Peter as a Teutonic-like soldier, and war as the only way to make the world a safer place. Mike Leonard April 06.\n",
      "First, some background. When I was a child, I avoided almost anything written for or marketed to children, for fear, usually justified, of Disneyfication. Anything with a list of three items in the title is particularly to be avoided, unless it's called THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY.If memory serves, there was an animated Disney version of this back then. And in fact, the current incarnation comes to us from Disney. Thus, I came to this film with extremely low expectations.I was wrong. I was wrong wrong WRONG. A compelling story told well, and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. This is why CGI was invented. It'll never be put to better use. Never.I've read a lot of criticisms lately claiming that C.S. Lewis was guilty of flagrant Christian symbolism. I don't see it here. What I see are features that are common to all or most mythologies, which is what the academic C.S. Lewis studied during his lifetime.Also, a big tip of the hat to whoever wrote the screenplay. I don't know how much is C.S. Lewis and how much is screenwriting, but for me this story never flagged because clever dialogue, delivered perfectly straight, had me giggling through what could have otherwise been boring walks through the scenery. Gorgeous scenery too, both in Narnia and back on good old Earth.\n",
      "I was entertained all throughout the movie. I have also read the books and felt like nothing important was left out. I highly recommend this movie to anyone seeking to have a good time watching a family-friendly flick. The four kids chosen to be main characters are very cute and their acting is good.There are three versions of the film to be aware of: one has just the movie, one has the movie and a special features DVD, and one has the movie and three discs of DVD features. I own the one with one special features DVD and cannot comment on the one with three special features DVDs. Buy the one you think you will want to watch!\n",
      "I have loved the Narnia series of stories all of my life. I have several different editions of the books, a cassette set of the dramatised BBC version (very well done) and the recently released audiobooks read by well known actors (Kenneth Branaugh's Magician's Nephew is a delight). I was very excited when it was announced that films were being made and looked forward to this one with just as much anticipation as the LOTR trilogy. Understand that it's a beautifully done film, visually gorgeous and the casting is spot on (I agree with everyone else, Lucy is perfect), BUT... For those like me who love the stories and the spirit in which they are told will not like this movie as much as some. The books tried to display and encourange the best qualities that are within all of us. Forget about the christian themes for a moment if you will, I mean good old character traits like courage, honesty, loyalty. For some reason the filmakers decided to infuse the characters with far too much frailty (the kids squabble needlessly, the beavers argue and insult each other, Edmund is now given a father at war as a justification for his treacherous behavior, Peter is quite wimpy at times, the list goes on). I also wondered as some others here did why Aslan is regular lion-size, though Liam Neeson's voice is wonderful. What I'm trying to say (and sorry to be so long-winded) is that this movie is well worth seeing for lovers of fantasy and Narnia, but while Peter Jackson made some changes with LOTR but still remained true to the stories most basic elements, this director did not. Maybe they'll do better with Prince Caspian. I'll be there on opening day to find out:).\n",
      "Indeed the female villain is a cliche, but Andrew Adamsom and Tilda Swinton have brought this archetype back to the top in stunning performance.\n",
      "Great family night movie... My boys loved it!\n",
      "I watched the movie in a theatre with lots of friends and we really enjoyed it. The animation is marvellous, and the direction superb. This is not a kiddish movie at all and I'm sure people of all ages can relate to it. It's got something for everyone. Give it a shot! you'll love it.\n",
      "I went to go see this movie with my mom and dad, and I must say that it was absolutely awesome to see an awesome book come to life on the big screen! I was totally amused by the fact that, \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", was actually a lot like the book, and to find that it was also a remake of the old version. I give this movie two thumbs all the way up, and I really liked how this movie was made! Two thumbs all the way up for, \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\"!~Alan~\n",
      "I loved this movie! I thought the Christian symolism is plain to see, especially for Christians. C.S. Lewis' classic collection is very well portrayed. Everyone I've talked to has said they liked it. Although it is not as epic as lord of the rings or star wars, it still moves me every time I watch it. The computer generated characters are by far the best I've seen, maybe because WETA did it. Can we say Lord of the Rings? Yea, well not only was the cinematography and storyline great, so was the music. Thank you Harry-Gregson Williams!! I'd say it's another musical masterpiece, up there with Star Wars. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet is missing out!\n",
      "My 4 year old daughter loves this movie and has watched it so many times off of a DVD rented from the library that I decided to purchase it for her to download on our Kindle.\n",
      "It came right on time.  Like new condition.  The seller was efficient and reliable.  I would definitely purchase from them again.  Thank you so much.  I love the Chronicles of Narnia series.  I was able to add another to my collection.\n",
      "They lay on the sarcasm rather thickly in this and \"Prince Caspian.  But over all, this is the ONE Narnia Movie is the most accurate and faithful to the book.  \"Prince Caspian\" and \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" are worse and barely stay true to what C.S. Lewis wrote.  But, This movie ( the lion, the witch and the wardrobe ) is the ONLY one that is worth buying!  Do not waste your money on the others.\n",
      "great book series, just buy thema nd read them, you will enjoy the imagery and be uplifted, even hooked.  I love the series.\n",
      "This movie takes me back to my childhood!!!!  It was AWESOME!!!  The effects & cast were perfect! Except for the queen, IMO!!!  Just like stepping into the book.  When's the next one?\n",
      "The film was a very good experience for this parent and my kids to enjoy together. This classic story may be a little on the scary side for the younger children; our 4 yr old daughter was needing to be reassured at some points. The film was best suited for our 9 yr old. Watching the film stimulated the kids interest in reading other stories by the author of the book this film was based on.\n",
      "I grew up with CS Lewis' Narnia Chronicles - I vividly remember sitting in Mrs Mackintosh's 5th grade class while she read about Lucy's meeting with Mr Tumnus - & I was nervous when I heard they were being made into a movie.  However I'm glad to say it was translated well to the big (& small) screen!  There are some minor changes to the story, but by & large it remains true to CS Lewis' vision.There's heaps of great extra's on this 2 disc version too, so we can see how they did it all!\n",
      "This movie is incredible and awesome to watch. There are so many Biblical truths within this movie and taken from New Testament and Old Testament. I am impressed and amazed at the imagery within this movie and how the representation of good and evil are so evident. My family watches this movie and my 6 year old even understands what this movie represents when we discuss it as a family.\n",
      "Four English children venture through a wardrobe into a world of wonder, magic and a magnificent Lion named Aslan.I've been waiting for more than 20 years for this very day; the day when I would meet Him; perhaps not face to face, but in a form that meets the expectations of my secret heart.And he did not disappoint. Aslan is every inch the king. He is amazingly real; one has the sense that were you to reach out you could touch him, if he would only allow it.For you see, it was for Aslan that I waited, it was Aslan whom I yearned to meet. I wanted to see him, and if not to touch him, to at least to hear his voice.But sadly, it was not Aslan's voice I heard.I heard Rob Roy!It is not Aslan's fault that I kept picturing Liam Neeson when the savior of Narnia spoke; that blame lay solely with Andrew Adamson for choosing poorly. Aslan would have been better served had his voice belonged to him alone; someone of Aslan's personage deserves his own identity. He is, after all, supreme creator. He is, remember, not a tame lion.But the identity crisis aside, LWW was all I could have hoped for. Tilda Swinton deserves an Oscar nod for her portrayal of Jadis; her performance is so strong it nearly steals the movie. She IS the White Witch; cool, cunning, calculating and the very personification of evil disguised as beauty.  Her screen presence is undeniably regal; one cannot ignore her. One cannot resist her.And one is struck, almost eerily, by the uncanny resemblance of the four young actors to the Pevensie children. They were not merely playing the characters of Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy; they became the very children of Lewis' creation. Their performance is flawless and heartbreakingly real; Lucy's wide-eyed wonder is as touching as Peter's marvelous Sir Gawaine-like courage in the face of danger. And Edmund and Susan do not disappoint in their respective roles; they play their parts without a single glitch.The details are there as well; things that only a true Narnia fan would notice and proof that Adamson took care with his subject. And though the scene at the Stone Table felt a little rushed, it was handled with the utmost respect and and loving attention to the little things.One last nod to the portrayal of the animals; Ma and Pa Beaver in particular. They were everything I could have hoped for, and Adamson more than did justice to the talking creatures of Narnia, who are every bit human in their voice and attitudes. Had he hit every other point and missed that one, the whole movie would have been wasted. Narnia is, after all, a land of talking animals!Aslan is on the move!PS: Unless you had read the books as a child, and are as big a Narnia freak as I am, I doubt Neeson's portrayal of Aslan will much bother you. It only bothers me because whenever I hear Aslan speak in my head, it's NOT Liam Neeson, who nonetheless does a fantastic job.\n",
      "Before exploring the importance of the movie itself, I wish to comment on several of reviews.  I notice that, not surprisingly, most of those giving the movie three to one stars all follow the same billing--that is, Christianphobic in nature and attitude...afraid of any film that might, surprise surprise, give a thumbs up toward the Christian values that have been so important for so many people throughout so many years.  These people hate and show disfavor to the movie because they simply hate Christians.  Interesting.  Why?  Because these are the same people who moan and groan and whine that Christians are not openminded--and yet they themselves are not openminded to letting Christians have their say.Now for the movie itself, the movie is a grand tale based upon a wonderful series of books written by C. S. Lewis, the same fine writer of Mere Christianity and the Space Trilogy.  The movie holds true to the imagery that Lewis held in his books, that is, a Judeo-Christian series of novels based upon Biblical foundations that are built on solid ground.  While there is much violence and action and adventure in the movie, and thus should be warned to parents who might want to bring very young (younger than 10 y.o.) children, still, there are important lessons that can be found within this movie and hopefully the sequels to the movie.  I hope and pray that this movie and the follow up movies will provoke and bring families together around the Bible, so that what is shown in fiction will be understood as eternal truths (which the Bible is, the truth, the eternal truth, of God through Jesus Christ).\n",
      "sorry this is so late in coming, it was quick and easy to deal with you and thanx for exactly what I ordered. Good price too!!thanx\n",
      "Just a good as the original movie if not better.Disney does it again. This is going to stay in my collection.\n",
      "Really captures the classic story we all love and have read many times over the years but this move tells it in a new visually stunning way!\n",
      "This is by far one of the best family movies  there is available.  I think that every home should pop some popcorn, make some lemonade, and curl up together to spend a night at home for once.\n",
      "I read these books as a small girl and loved them; and, I am currently reading them to my 7 y/o daughter.  Reading them now, I appreciate them from a child's view, and especially love that a chapter book has captivated my child.  However, I did find some points rather disappointing.  As a book, this series falls significantly shortly of JRR Tolkein's books but seemed to try and mirror a lot of his epic tale.  The story leaves holes that Tolkein did not and because of that I couldn't give it 5 stars, and I grudgingly gave it 4 (3.5 is better suited).  The movie itself is the same as the book.  It leaves a lot to be questioned, it does not encompass a fantasy as it should and the young actors were not properly directed throughout.To elaborate on the last point, I felt the Narnia world leaves a lot to be imagined.  It does not go into the depths that I feel any science fiction should.  The community is minimal, the land is not as fascinating as it could, and should, have been.  The child actors, while young, were often corny (for lack of a better term).  Even my daughter laughed at Lucy's expressions, or Susan's and Lucy's absence from the \"war\".  For me, I realize that at the time of the books women were not strong and self-sustaining as characters, but allowing Edmund, Susan's much younger brother (and Lucy's elder by only a year), to participate in the war while Susan laid with a corpse for hours on end was awkward.  The children altogether didn't develop as characters should, and when they did reach those coming of age moments, they were lacking in detail and logic.Despite that, I was happy to realize that, similar to the Golden Compass movie, the religious undertones are not blatant to a child unless someone pointed them out as such.To anyone hoping to feel the awe that was created by Tolkein, and again illustrated in the LOTR movies, Narnia will fall short, in both book and movie.  Nonetheless, it is timeless and something that can be appreciated.  My daughter has loved LOTR and Narnia movies; however, she isn't able to read Tolkein or Pullman yet so I won't compare in that sense.\n",
      "This movie will have pride of place next to my Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  Having read the books as a child and recently bought the box set, I was disapointed that they released the 2nd book before the 1st ( but that was a minor irritant).  GO SEE THE MOVIE.  YOU WON'T BE DISAPOINTED!  Everyone was just fixated by the movie.  Of course it was a little slow to begin, but when Lucy discovers Narnia the excitement begins.  The battle scenes were good (almost but not quite a LOTR copy) and the entire theatre applauded when Aslan showed up in the middle of the battle with the extra troops.  The end of the movie was great too, with the adult versions of the child actors very convincing.  I hope they continue to make the other books into movies.  My personal favourite is the horse and his boy, so I have something to look forward to.  Go see the movie.  Buy the DVD when it's released.  You won't regret it.\n",
      "This is such a beautiful movie! My family & I watch it again and again, and it doesn't get old. The music, the special effects, the actors, everything is perfect. You won't be dissappointed.To fully understand the beginning, it helps to have read the books first. Not necessary, but provides more insight.\n",
      "You may read other views of this film from other reviewers.  I am sure most of them will highlight the highlights and lowlights.  However, if you are a Christian parent or Granparent heed this advice . . .Chronicles of Narnia is a classic of Christian children's literature.  Read the book aloud to your children.  You can read a chapter a night and get through it in two weeks.  The kids will love the story.  THEN . . . take them to the film. . . . THEN use it as a teaching tool.  They are never too young to learn about their faith.  THEN . . . read the rest of the books in the series . . . THEN wait for the rest of the films.  What a gift!  A series for children that can be used as a teaching tool.For Christian Grandparents . . . Buy the video as soon as it is released.  Though it is not without flaws, it is the best rendering of this classic to date.\n",
      "Greatly anticipated I was not disappointed with this adaptation of C.S. Lewis' great book and hope the series can continue to deliver a wonderful story with today's nearly miraculous technology.  CGI has come a long way in a few short years and the lion Aslan in this movie nearly looks life like.  The battle scenes, incorporating thousands of creatures, are amazingly well done.What gives this movie a slightly less than stellar rating, at least for me, is the fact that the characters just aren't developed enough to really capture the heart of the viewer.  Not that the acting isn't very well done, it's just that, well for one thing, it's hard to really make a CGI character truly real, no matter how well done the voice overs are, the nearly life like is just that, nearly.  I suppose there just wasn't time to really develop five protagonists in a two hour movie, and that isn't really the fault of anyone or anything, it just is.  In reading the book the person reading it can take certain parts of it and make it real in the imagination.  The reader can identify with a certain character and take on the fantasy, such is the nature of reading good fiction, but in  movie making, this just isn't possible.Of course comparisons to the Lord of the Rings trilogy will abound, and I will make mine here, I thought this just fell short.  Perhaps the mere fact that the lead characters were children makes this the case, perhaps the nature of the evil to be overcome being better presented in LTR makes it so.  I will make one observation, in the LWW the evil forces don't quite present the same overwhelming odds that they seemed to in LTR, so perhaps this made the tension a bit less.I've seen this at the theaters twice already, once with a large group and once again including a few kids and my four year old.  In the large group, the movie was mostly considered good, with one person really enjoying it a lot, she being someone that hadn't read the book.  The next night my teenaged nephew gave it high praises.  The ten year olds I was with were a bit scared, however they liked the movie.  The tell tale sign I got, however, was from my four year old.  That age tends to see things we adults are able to ignore, that being slow spots while story and back story are being developed.  She asked a couple of times during the show if it was time to go yet, however, when it was all said and done, she gives the movie a big thumbs up and declares the White Witch her favorite character.  She, for some unknown reason, also loves Darth Vader, so who knows, perhaps it's parenting.This leads the the question of appropriateness, and I felt it was fine for young kids, although of course, it does have some scary scenes and scary characters, the ten year olds were scared a few times and my four year old hid her eyes on a few occasions, however, they didn't include any gore or blood, all battle deaths were of the clean implied type, this certainly wasn't Braveheart of anything of that nature, thus the pg as opposed to pg 13 rating.  With no language or any sexual or adult type themes, this movies only reason for being pg is the violence and scariness factors.  For kids not used to this kind of drama, this movie will probably be a bit scary, even too scary, but for those that watch LTR or similar, this one is a bit tamer.All in all I think this is a great family movie.  In spite of what some may claim, C.S. Lewis wrote Aslan as Jesus, there is no getting around that without disregarding Lewis' own words, it was the reason he included the idea of Christmas finally coming when Aslan was \"on the move\" and he said as much in a letter he wrote decades ago to an American girl that wrote to him in England to ask him about the nature of Aslan.  Only those that are ignorant or intentionally being misleading would claim that this story is not a Christology and that the whole series was not written to convey many Christian themes and ideals.  In any case, whether or not one is a Christian or chooses to look for Christian symbolism in the film, it is a good and entertaining movie, a great family movie, a movie worth seeing more than once and undoubtedly will be one worth buying when it comes out on dvd.\n",
      "You won't regret this movie, or the others that are part of the series.If you love adventure and otherworld type stories, you are gonna love these.full of honor and courage, compassion, and all the great stuff!Highly recommend!\n",
      "In C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia, you have to believe that Aslan is as real as a literary lion can be in order to suspend belief. I think that is why he waits until so late in the book The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe to let you know that Aslan is 'the' Lion of the title. When the TV version of the book was released in 1988, the Lion just didn't make the grade and the believability of the story suffered for it. Of course it also didn't help that the child playing Lucy had a voice that just seemed, well whiney.So, when I first heard of this remake I had mixed feelings. I knew that special effects were now up to doing wonderfully real creatures. Then I saw the previews and knew I had to see this film. Well, it was all I hoped for. The children are natural and a good fit for the characters in the books. Aslan was a regal and larger than life lion. And best of all the story was told with an honest effort to stick to the book. For the full review see the January issue of SFRevu.com\n",
      "On Friday night my wife and I made it to a showing of the new film, \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\". I grew up reading The Chronicles of Narnia, and because of that I've been anticipating the release of this movie for quite some time. Judging upon the movie's first weekend numbers ($67.1 million), there were a good number of others out there like me who couldn't wait to get a peek into the fanciful world that C.S. Lewis created for us in his series of books.======[possible spoilers below]=======The movie opens with a scene of terror as Nazi bombers rain down fire and destruction on the city of London. The Pevensie children and their mother huddle in the relative safety of their bomb shelter as the explosions pierce the night air. The mother realizing that the children won't be safe in the city, sends them away to live at an estate in the English countryside, where their adventures quickly ensue.This beginning to the movie, although I don't think it was in the book, is helpful movie shorthand for laying the groundwork for the relationships between the siblings, and what roles they're going to play in the movie. Edmund begins to shows his rebellious and careless ways, and Peter shows up as the caring, albeit domineering older brother. Susan comes in as the questioning doubting pessimist and Lucy as the carefree believing child.Once at the estate the story begins quickly with Lucy entering the wardrobe and discovering Narnia for the first time. I have to say that the performance of the actor portraying Lucy (Georgie Henley) was for me one of the highlights of this film. She was very believable and engaging, the kind of child that you just love and want to pick up and squeeze. Throughout the movie, she kept making me smile - and you could just tell that she really is a child full of joy and wonderment. In some respects she stole the whole movie - upstaging the performances of the other actors to some degree.After the rest of the children enter the world of Narnia the movie begins revealing some of the wonderful talking creatures including Mr. Tumnus, the beavers, the wolves and their secret police force and many others. Most of them came off wonderfully - with my personal favorites being the beavers. They seemed very believable to me. Aslan was also especially good, sometimes i almost forgot that it wasn't a real lion talking and interacting with the other characters. Some of the other characters, however, to me felt a little to \"CG-ish\". There were times that you could really tell that there was computer animation at work, and it was a bit distracting at times. For example in several scenes I noticed that animals didn't seem to blend in with their surroundings very well (shadowing not quite right), or that they didn't seem to follow the laws of physics quite how they should. Some seemed almost like they were wire models.For the most part I thought the visual scenery was very stunning, from the snow covered forests and mountains, to Aslan's camp in the hills. The Beavers home was also just how I'd imagined it from the book. The only setting in the movie that I didn't really like was the witches castle. In my mind I had always imagined it as this huge forboding place with acres upon acre of frozen stone Narnians, and vast cold halls and filled with evil creatures of every stripe. In the movie I almost felt like the witches lair was cramped, that it didn't really speak to how evil and powerful she was.The plot of the movie follows the book very closely, with the elements of sin, redemption, salvation and sacrifice playing a prominent role. Some of the strongest scenes for me were the ones in which Aslan offers himself up as a sacrifice in place of Edmund. Aslan leaves the camp in the wee hours of the night, and walks with Lucy and Susan as he makes his way to the stone table. The scene gave me chills, and really drove home the anguish that Aslan was in. Also the sacrifice scene really drove home how there is a battle between good and evil, and that sometimes things can seem very dark indeed. Maybe a good lesson for the times that we're in - even though things may look grim, there is the hope that comes with the morning.The one other thing I didn't like about the movie was how the children's characters just picked up their weapons before battle and instantly became experts in their use, despite the fact that they were fighting obviously more experienced fighters on the other side. On this note you have to suspend your disbelief in favor of following the storyline.All in all I thought the movie was very good. The strong points were the plot, characters, strong moral message and beautiful and stunning locations. For me the strong points were VERY strong. Weak points for me included some of the CG work, a couple of the locations and a few situations that asked you to suspend your disbelief. On a scale of 1-5 stars, I give \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" 4 stars.\n",
      "Disney would have made C. S. lewis proud with this production of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe.  I watched this play every year at Christmas time and have loved it from the start.The panoramic snow scenes and stage decorum are nothing short of spectacular.  The religious allegory that goes with the storyline is enhanced in the battle and the ending is left just right for sequels.I have said this in many reviews.  Disney you deserved the oscar for this picture.\n",
      "This movie was great for the whole family to watch! The kids loved all three movies. It was a marathon Sunday movie time.\n",
      "Read the book as a kid and couldn't believe how perfect they made the movie to the book! It is a wonderful cast and excellent characters! My daughter was so happy to have all the Narnia movies for her collection!\n",
      "The kids have watched it several times over the past few days. They love it. Every night my son asks to watch it again.\n",
      "I have been a fan of the series ever since the animated version of the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was made.  Since then I kept up with the BBC productions and have read all the books.  The movie was outstanding, and can easily compare with a wide variety of other fantasy movies.  My only concern with this movie is that it should have had a sort of prologue or recap on Jadis' and Narnia's origins (from the book The Magician's Nephew).  Even though a recap was not included in the actual book (none was needed because it was well understood when we read the entire series) it would have helped explain some of the questions people who are new to the story might have had.  All in all, great movie.\n",
      "It has it all....drama, fantasy, adventure.  I loved it and I'd think anybody would.\n",
      "lost this to a used to be friend and I was happy to find it for a steal. 5 bucks. very pleased. great price and fast shipping\n",
      "We highly recommend all the Chronicles of Narnia movies.  We love them and watch them regularly.  The books are good too.\n",
      "my kids love these movies and the price was good for not being able to find it anywhere else in store\n",
      "I think its cool because I like stuff like that. The battle is awsome.I have two copies of it.\n",
      "Wow, none of the kid actors got on my nerves...they did a great joband the movie is excellent as a entertainment form.Its quite a fantasy tale, that does not slow down, the costumes, theactors/actresses, the strange creatures, the scenery the music,need i say more.....Production values are high and the direction of the film flawless.Enjoy\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe [Blu-ray] This is a truly exciting movie for everyone to enjoy. Great acting, great sets, great story, great special effects and well shot. A truly wonderful tale that takes you far away from the hum drum. Catch this one if you haven't as yet.\n",
      "You can kiss Harry Potter goodbye, because the ultimate seriesof epic fantasy has finally made it to the big screen!The Chronicles of NarniaIt's the battle between good and evil. I'm a big fan of thebooks so needless to say, when I saw this preview at the STAR WARS:episode III premiere, I couldn't breath for three days!It stays very true to the book, the battle scenes aren't THATgory as Return of the King was, it features a rollicking scoreand the animals looked almost real!Anyone who has not seen this apparently hasn't lived!!!Once you see it, you'll never forget it!\n",
      "I remember Narnia books when I was a kid. It's was like the world you want to be. Watching the movie it was like coming back in time in Technicolor. I love it. Beautiful like Lord of The Rings, and involving like The Lion King. Same style also. Pure fantasy entering that closet. Wow. I wish I had one of those. Family movie. Purely. A little long for the little ones but worthy to have it.\n",
      "Overall the movie is quite good and conveys Lewis's story line. The added / altered scenes (such as the flight of the children with Mr. and Mrs. Beaver) are not need but do not retract too much from the original story.\n",
      "I love Narnia. I have grown up with it and it has been amazing :) It is really cool, the 2 disc thing. I found out a lot of stuff about the play, C.S. Lewis, and Narnia. I would definitely recommend this to Narnia fans and really anybody :)\n",
      "Lawrence from Texas totally did not get the allegorical aspect of this movie.  Please...read other reviews! For Christians, there really is much to see:  Edmund sees the folly of his wrongdoing.  Peter repents of his treating Edmund harshly and... Beaver's only teasing his wife, Lawrence... you don't recognize love!  :-)For non-Christians, it's a great adventure that's not too violent and yet has plenty of human interest and plot twists to keep both adults and kids involved. There are great examples of love and teamwork and imagination and forgiveness...It's a love story. It's an adventure. It's a family movie.It's a great movie.\n",
      "The Narnia books are fantasy classics.  One of my all time favorite series was given justice in not just the adaptation, but now in this beautiful high def transfer.Everyone knows the story, and by now, anyone who wanted to see the film already has.  The question before us, is it worth getting this Blu-ray version?  The short answer is, hell yeah.The long answer is the reasons why.  First and foremost is the clear and pristine transfer.  For this type of fantasy film, where the colors are somewhat exaggerated and need to pop, the HD transfer helps make this film into a more memorable experience.  The detail is there, just like you would expect from an HD transfer, and the blacks are rich and distinct enough so that there is no crush.The special features are plenty - although I haven't done a comparisson as to how many there are versus the 2 disc DVD edition, from a quick glance, it has plenty to keep those who love special features satisfied.Lovely film, lovely transfer.  That's all a movie lover can ask for.  Buy this, and make sure Disney keeps bringing great films to blu-ray.\n",
      "Right from the beginnig of the movie (which starts with the bombing of London) you are caught up with the family. And once the children have entered Narnia, some might be reminded of the Lord of the Rings because of the beautiful scenery and the amazing music that just entraps you and keeps you fearing for the children while the wolves attack, crying during the sacrifice (which can be slightly creepy), and sharing in the victory. Of course, it is slightly changed from the book version, but what movie isn't? All in all it keeps to the format of the story and brings the marvelous world of Narnia alive to those who didn't bother read the chronicles.\n",
      "At first I wasn't too interested in seeing the movie. But as an after school suprise my mom took my younger brother and I to the theater to see this and I have to admit, I was blown away.The acting was wonderfull for the most part, though certain things like the fact Georgie (Who plays Lucy) Looks as though she is *laughing* while she's supposed to be crying, and several lines got to me as cheesy. Parts of the battle were poorly done as well.But all negativity aside this is a remarkable movie. After seeing it I ran out and got my hands on the books... and had them read in less than a week. Soon I became fully obsessed with Narnia and by the time it came out, my friend and I had gone to the theater four times to watch it.The characters and plotline stay remarkably true to C.S. Lewis book with some scenes added and others taken away but it was more of a \"pacing\" issue and having to make it exciting for older kids.This is one of the RARE cases where the movie actually is far greater than the book.\n",
      "C.S.Lewis had an amazing imagination and was able to portray the Easter message in a unique way. This is an excellent movie that follows the book well. Great entertainment for the whole family. Even my 5 yr old enjoyed it. There are some scary looking creatures in a couple scenes.\n",
      "The movie is good but if you compare it with the other Hollywood films with some stunning New Zeland locations then it would be your mistake. Unlike LOTR I, II & III you won't get much scenic views of the country. I loved this movie because after a long time a hollywood movie has showed my favorite game cricket. If the children didn't play cricket then the red duce ball wouldn't have broken the window glass and they would have never tried to hide themselves inside the wardrobe. I used to buy the DVDs from justwilliams but they don't have any after sales service. so this time I am waiting for the release and I would buy DVD online from [...] - another Amazon associate like justwilliams.\n",
      "I loved, loved, loved The Lord of the Rings movies, but my sister wasn't allowed to see them, so I've only seen each of them once, which really stinks. I want to be able to watch them when she's around, you know?Well, when I saw The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, I was silently cheering in my head because this is a movie that my sister can watch! I've seen some people say it's just a watered down version of The Lord of the Rings (see below reviews), and that might be true to some people, but is it necessarily a bad thing? I mean, you gotta admit, The Lord of the Rings isn't really a kid-friendly movie, you know what I mean? But the all-around messege is! Does that really make sense? To have a movie about friendship that kids can't see?The Chronicles of Narnia is all about families and being loyal to yourself and your siblings and all that, and it's a movie that kids can actually see! I don't know about some people, but I really felt a connection with the oldest sibling, Peter, because it's obvious that he really feels a strong obligation to protect his brother and sisters, and he really loves them, and that's the same way I am with my sister, even though we may fight sometimes!Any parents out there who have kids that argue, fight, etc, I would recommend this movie to. Your kids will probably feel a connection too, though they might not admit it!You might want to rent it before you buy it to make sure you really like it, because even though I thought it was a winner, you can never be completely positive.Heads Up: There is one part in the end of the movie that some littler kids might think is scary. One of the main characters is thought to have died, and that's kind of a sad part.Otherwise, wow! A real accomplishment!\n",
      "I must say, this movie had reminded me of why I fell in love with this book when I was 10, I suppose for the same reason why anyone falls in love with The Chronicles of Narnia. The movie captured the magic of falling through the wardrobe into the frozen forest, of Lucy finding the streetlamp and of meeting the fawn, and even of turkish delight conjured by the White Witch. To me, the saddest part had always seemed to be the fact that the four children who become kings and queens of Narnia eventually go back. This final sequence had also been perfectly captured, and was just as wistful as I remember the book being.As to the acting, it was truly fantastic. Several times during the movie, I found myself smiling at the expressions on Georgie Henley's face: she is such a wonderful little actress. I will be watching out for her. And, by God, Tilda Swinton makes a perfect Satanic figure (let's call things by their proper names, i.e. this is after all a book written by C.S. Lewis after he had embraced religion...). By her own words, she is playing the ultimate \"white Nazi supremacist,\" and each icy words that drops from her thin lips is an exercise in cruelty and coldness that personify absolute evil.Though there are small deviations from the book, overall it's a gorgeous and moving adaptation. Truly, I couldn't find too many faults with it, and people of different beliefs and religious/anti-religious convictions will be able to identify with the story. Everyone understands Good against Evil, after all.My one gripe about the movie had been that it's a bit too clean. I mean, the filmmakers clearly intended to create a safe and perfectly acceptable Disney movie for the masses. That's fine. As an adult, however, I was unsatisfied by this exercise in PG censorship. Don't you worry, this movie isn't nearly violent enough. Even Aslan, killed and resurrected, springs to life with barely a drop of blood spilt.In other words, it's perfect for children and nearly perfect for adults who want to see one of their beloved books come to life...\n",
      "I was thrilled to receive my special edition 4-DVD Chronicles of Narnia.  But when I opened the wrap, the Customer Guide was not there.  I contacted the people and within 2 days, there at my front door was a no-charge replacement.It is nice when people respond quickly when you place a paying order.  It is outstanding when they replace the order, no money involved any longer, with such high integrity.  It makes me feel super to know there are still such honest people around.  Thanx.  I'll be back.  Ann\n",
      "I was a fan of the books as a child and was very pleased with how the movie was handled!  The acting of the children was wonderful!  Lucy particularly stole the show!I also enjoyed the special effects of the movie.  I love how the graphics really just added to it, rather then the movie being all about the special effects.  For example, when we meet Tumnus his legs seem so natural that we can focus on him as a character.  And little details like him stomping his feet when he comes inside from the snow are priceless!Aslan, and the whole battle sequences looked fantastic!  The Gryphon was breathtaking.  Unfortunately I felt the fox, and in some parts the wolves did not hold up to the same standards.  (not to say they were bad, just not as good)The battle went by quickly, leaving you wanting to see more.  (in some ways this is good, it didn't drag) For sure something that will be fun to pause and inspect in more detail on DVD!Very fun, worth every penny!\n",
      "This movie always gives a sense of wonder and magic while at the same time inspiring the viewer spiritually.  It's a must see if you love fantasy and heroism with a clear sense of the element of faith.\n",
      "Must See video! It is one of the best adaptations available.It is a excellent movie for people of all ages.\n",
      "This is a good basic story of good and evil. Love the beavers Enjoy watching with my grand children\n",
      "One of the better movies that has come out this year.  One thing that I would like to clear up first is that \"the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\" IS the first book written by C.S. Lewis in the Chronicles of Narnia Series, but it is true that it chronologically follows the \"magican's nephew.\"Now on to the movie.  The four pevensie children were all very moving characters and the devotion to the book is very well done.  Very few things were cut and the visual effects made Narnia come to life.  If you enjoy the books or other fantasy I highly suggest you see this movie.\n",
      "I'm happy this movie came out, because now all of my friends who never would think of reading a book for pleasure are all rushing to get their hands on the seven Narnia books and reading like the wind.  Very happy.  I liked the movie a lot and was glad when the actress for Lucy turned out to NOT be annoying and sappy, like I was afraid she might be.  (I was dreading some sort of Emma Watson Hermione Granger high-pitched and exasperated voice).  I thought it was funny that Liam Neeson managed to pop up in this...he seems to be popping up in all of these movies that I've watched recently.The creatures and environment all looked great, buuuut I thought the effects could have been worked on more so that the animals wouldn't look like they came out of a video game.  Aslan looked good most of the time, but sometimes he just looked a bit fuzzy or too fluid-like.....as if he wasn't entirely solid.  But don't listen to me, you may watch it and think they're flawlessly done effects...I don't know.  Other than that, he was extremely likeable and you could feel the mix of killer warrior/nice grandpa-type in him.  Especially cool was the part where he bites off the Witch's head....The Witch, by the way, was well-done too and I liked her evil creatures more than any other secondary people.  Hehe.\n",
      "Watching The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, I felt myself transported into alternate reality of The Lord of the Rings.  Indeed, this film is based on C.S. Lewis' classic novel, and its author was friends with J.R.R. Tolkien at the time.  The Christian story is hinted at in the movie, just as the novel is, but if one expects the film to preach, he or she would be wrong.  This film is wonderful, faithful to the novel in terms of the visuals and the story, and I felt myself truly involved throughout the entire film.The story takes place in 1930's England, when the German army was at the time bombing London.  The Pevensie children, Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter are evacuated to the countryside, where they reside in the museum-like home of the Professor.  The home, full of artifacts, corridors, and winding stairs, ends up becoming an excellent place for a game of hide-and-seek, and it is then that Lucy encounters the wardrobe and enters the world of Narnia, an wintry land that has been ruled by the cold control of the White Witch.The fantastical world of Narnia, I'm glad to say, is given a gradual introduction in terms of special effects.  The first time we enter Narnia, we encounter Mr. Tumnus, a faun, and the subtle effects are amazing.  Over the course of the next hour we are introduced to talking beavers, wolves, and ultimately a massive battle where creatures of all shapes, sizes, myths, and continents (cheetahs leading the front lines) clash.Andrew Adamson, I must note, was a visual effects consultant for the Batman movies, and has directed the Shrek films.  Another filmmaker whose roots began in visual effects was Rob Coleman, who directed the XXX films.  The reason for this reference would be to compare two completely directors and their approaches.  Hands down kudos goes to Adamson for his direction.  This movie has handled the materials between story and visuals excellently.  THe performances were well done, especially by Tilda Swinton as the White Witch.There are six more adaptations on the way.  This film, i must add, has driven me to read all seven novels in the Chronicle until then.  I would highly recommend all other viewers to the same.\n",
      "CS Lewis defined the 20th century Christian intellectual, and an overarching mission of his writings was repackaging and representing the Christian message for each generation. This meant straight retellings from his own life, (\"Surprised by Joy,\" \"A Grief Observed\") fairy tales with subversively Christian allegory and subtext (the \"Chronicles of Narnia\" series) logical, reasoned instruction (\"Mere Christianity\") and even Christianity inside out through \"Screwtape Letters'\" Satanic reverses.Disney/Walden Media's exceptional retelling of Lewis' \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,\" now a rich 2DVD set, fills in Lewis' brush strokes but delivers an adventure faithful to his vision. \"Mere Christianity\" states men have been dropped into earth as Enemy territory, and are trying to subvert it for good. Director Andrew Adamsen (\"Shrek\") proves this early and grandly. Young Lucy Pevensie, (11-year old Georgie Henley in a cheeky debut) finds the hidden kingdom behind a wardrobe at a home where she, sister Susan (Anna Popplewell) and brothers Peter (William Moseley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) are being sheltered from London's Nazi Blitzkrieg.Without revealing too much story, Adamsen unfolds this fantasy giving human heroes a family's vulnerability, unity, and frailty, and animal characters human senses of community and bravery. The talking beavers and fox here aren't Disney's stock cutesy,wisecracking animals. The White Witch (Tilda Swinton in a literally standout role as the gorgon giantess) successfully captures the hushed tones and inconsistent behavior adults (many of which Lewis didn't respect) use to frighten and intimidate children. Her cruel scenes with young Edmund, allowing her to creep closer to her showdown with troops of the Great Lion Aswar, are among \"Narnia\"'s most effective and disturbing.Christian allegory, from Father Christmas' cameo to the children's reunion with Edmund to deep and deeper magic scenes at the Stone Table, prevail but don't overwhelm a story deftly merging the grandeur and character of \"Lord of the Rings,\" the Harry Potter franchise and overtones of \"Passion of the Christ.\"  Sadly, Lewis' deeper purpose is downplayed in \"Narnia's\" DVD extra features. These include a making-of documentary, blooper reel, a instructive soundtrack featuring cast commentary and pop-up facts on Lewis' life, and a computer generated Narnia interactive map.Overall, director Adamsen, executive producer (and Lewis stepson) Douglas Gresham and the Walden/Disney team created a labor of supernatural love, drawing on Lewis' fantasy and the  real moral lessons in loyalty, sacrifice, and forgiveness behind it. \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" is an essential DVD in what will no doubt become a successful and anticipated series.\n",
      "Again another outstanding movie...so glad I have this movie in my collection ....and glad I got it!  U SO ROCK! `\n",
      "Great rendition of the wonderful story from C. S. Lewis! Moving & exciting for all ages. I need more words...\n",
      "First of all I will say that I have never seen an adaptation of a movie based on a book that followed the original story as closely as this one. Sure there were changes here and there, but it kept to the same basic storyline and totally captured the spirit of C. S. Lewis' masterpiece.Now about the film, It's a great adventure movie full of action and a pretty good Villain, and a great sense of wonder. The acting of the children is amazing and it's so easy to believe they are a family. The action scenes are pretty intense and epic. though the scene where Aslan dies may scare little children. The only problem I can see problem I have with this film is that the plot lags just a little in the middle of the film.\n",
      "I actually had never heard any of these stories as a child as was thrilled with the movie. It was so beautiful and fantastical. Great family entertainment and awesome visual effects.\n",
      "This is a gorgeous movie with beautiful characters.  I love the whole concept and did not grow up reading these books.  I will read them now.\n",
      "The visual style of this film reminded me of the fantasy movies of the 1980's like \"The NeverEnding Story\", \"Return to Oz\" and \"Dark Crystal\". However, much like the modern Harry Potter movies and Star Wars prequels, the filmmakers have diminished character development in favor of large loads of computer effects and action scenes. I would think that a child who sees it without having read the book will be a bit baffled as to why some of these events are taking place.For instance, it's not explained that the movie begins in World War II era London (I think that would help kids who haven't read the book understand why the Pevensie family's home is being bombed), Lucy and Mr. Tumnus meet and 4 minutes later are soul mates and best friends forever (a little more character interaction would have made Tumnus' fate much more meaningful). The beavers explain the great prophecy about as dramatically and effectively as my mom trying to explain an episode of \"Lost\". Before his self-sacrifice, Aslan says and does practically nothing to clue you in as to why he is the savior of Narnia (a few scenes of the kids getting to know more about the history of Narnia and showing Aslan passing on words of wisdom would have raised the emotional level considerably).On the upside...If you HAVE read the book, it's quite fun to watch many of these scenes come to life. Tilda Swinton as the White Witch is spot on! I would eat her turkish delight any day of the week. The little girl who plays Lucy is absolutely perfect. If being adorable were an Olympic event, she would certainly take the gold medal. Also, Aslan's sacrifice is shockingly graphic and disturbing. I think they might have brought in Mel Gibson as guest director for this scene.Speaking of which, all the Christian allegory is here if you're looking for it. It's actually quite subdued. Similar to \"Lord of the Rings\" and the ORIGINAL Star Wars trilogy, this movie stresses the importance of courage, honor and friendship. As our society becomes increasingly more shallow and materialistic with every day that goes by, I welcome a kid's movie like this, even with it's flaws.\n",
      "Narnia is simply a classic, among the many significant writings by C.S. Lewis.  The movie does the book story justice, realizing that no book movie perfectly describes the book.  The characters are well chosen and certainly draws the viewer into the realm of Narnia as the White Witch casts her spells and evil.  Graphics are superb, with Aslan as well as the other \"creatures\" coming to life as if in reality.  This is both a kid's and grownup's story that can be taken as clean entertainment or be understood allegorically.  Few movies are worth a repeat watch, but this is one of them.  The 135 minutes seems to fly by in no time!\n",
      "This movie has the most outstanding visual effects. The animals look real. You will really think you're seeing a talking lion, talking beavers, centaurs, and dozens of other magical creatures. I read the books when I was really young; I can't say I remember them, but it was nice going into the film without any preconceived notions about what it SHOULD be, when what this movie IS is just a wonderful movie.The movie is about four children, all who are displaced from WWII, made to live with a professor in his giant house. They can't touch anything, run, shout, or disturb the professor. Lucy, the youngest child, says that hide-and-seek is a fairly quiet game, so all the kids proceed to play, with little Lucy running for cover when she finds a beautifully carved wardrobe. It's the only object in the entire room. She opens the door and hides within a bundle of coats. As she scoots back to hide herself a little more, she suddenly realizes: she's not in the wardrobe any more. She's in Narnia, where she meets a goofy half-man, half-goat creature. Of course, her siblings refuse to believe her, until all of them end up in Narnia as well.The plot is really intricate, that I don't want to go into it all. The point is that this is a really fantastic movie. That's all anyone ever really needs to know. It might be a little scary for small children, but any kid who can watch the Harry Potter flicks without flinching should be just find with this movie. You'll love the stunning the visuals and this simply magical story. So much more goes on this movie that I can't even seem to put into words. Yes, it's that good. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n",
      "\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" is an American fantasy movie released in 2005. It's based on a novel by the British writer Clive Staples Lewis. The novel has been adapted for TV or cinema several times before.When I saw an old animated version of \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", I considered it a very strange story, but nothing more. People entirely new to the Narnia concept will probably react in similar ways when seeing this American movie version. What on earth is this story about?The truth, of course, is that \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" is a Christian allegory. If you look carefully, it's all in there. The White Witch is the Devil, the treachery of Edmund symbolizes the fall of Adam and Eve, Aslan is Jesus Christ, and his voluntary sacrifice to save Edmund is the crucifixion. And yes, he comes back and resurrects all the dead. Then comes Judgment Day, when the good battles the forces of evil.Small wonder people think it's a weird storyline...As already mentioned, the story is based on a novel by C.S. Lewis, also titled \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\". (Incidentally, the professor of the story is probably a humorous reference to Lewis himself.) Lewis' express purpose was to write an allegorical Christian novel for children. He later expanded the concept and wrote six additional novels. Together the seven books are known as \"The Chronicles of Narnia\".Frankly, I think this de-Christianized, Americanized and politically correct version of \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" is much better than the original!The clean shaven, old fashioned kids of the original story (not to mention a notorious British adaptation for TV) are more modern in the movie version. Also, the Christian references are less overt. But the best change concerns the gender roles. Lewis was almost ridiculously patriarchal, so in the original story the girls Lucy and Susan aren't supposed to participate in the final battle between Aslan's forces and the evil legions of the White Witch. And why is the Devil symbolized by a woman, anyway? In the movie, the poor devil is still female, but at least Susan is a soldier. Interestingly, Peter (the older brother) is something of a sceptical wimp!A covertly feminist version of \"The Chronicles of Narnia\"? Who could have imagined?The movie even contains unexpected humour, as when the fox delivers the unforgettable one-liner: \"I wish I could say their bark was worse than their bite\". The bickering between Beaver and his wife is also extremely entertaining.This movie adaptation of \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" also has an ironic twist. It has *very* obvious similarities with Peter Jackson's successful \"Lord of the Rings\" movies. Indeed, the rip off was clearly visible already in the trailer. The twist, of course, is that C.S. Lewis was personally acquainted with J.R.R. Tolkien. One of Lewis' science fiction novels, \"That hideous strength\", contains a partial cross-over with the Lord of the Rings universe of Tolkien. It's therefore ironic that a movie adaptation of Lewis' Narnia stories mimics movies based on Tolkien. It seems you really cannot separate Lewis and Tolkien!C.S. Lewis was an interesting writer of both Christian fiction and non-fiction. I have given Lewis his due in other reviews. I have to admit, however, that I sometimes tend to get tired at his supernatural musings. A big thanks to Walt Disney for remaking this story into a light, entertaining adventure epic.Five stars.\n",
      "We've watch most renditions of this to movie and this is by far the best.  Some things changed, but overall great movie to keeps the characters true to the book.  Hopefully it encourages those who never read the series to do so.\n",
      "I liked a lot of the expanding that was done on the book. I feel that it gave a depth that Lewis made possible by being rather vague in some areas. It is permissible to be vague in a book, but details are necessary for the movie screen.Many of the changes have to do with adding scenes. Adam Adamson (the director of the movie) says reading the book as an adult is like visiting your childhood home and finding it smaller than you expected. \"I really wanted to make my memory of the book, rather than take it straight off the page.\"You may noticed some changes, but really can't put your finger on what changed.\n",
      "There are others here who have stated it much more eloquently than I but I will cast my vote to the positive.  I saw this today, with only limited recollection from the books, and enjoyed it very much.  I would, however, use caution in taking young children to see this.  There is some violence in it relative to the witch's treatment of the Narnia denizens, the battle scenes and Aslan's \"journey.\"  That said, enjoy.\n",
      "Kittykins gave a lot of good detail, which is what I usually refer to as a spoiler but not in this case.  Parents need to know what this show portends.  If you are a Jew or other religion you may reject the religious allegory but you cannot fault the storyline or special effects and panoramic views of a land of ice and snow...slowly thawing as love arrives to break a spell long overdue to be broken.  Leaves from trees form figures and send messages and codes to the sons of Adam and daughters of Eve.It was time for a Disney Oscar! But it didn't get what it deserved.\"The Walt Disney production of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was Disney at its best. The religious allegations of the movie gave it a more worthy standing in the the movie world as a tool for children that teaches moral values without being preachy. It leaves nothing out of the main concept that compelled C. S. Lewis, an atheist converted to \"Christianity\" to write it.  He has turned the Bible message into one acceptable to the child and if you will forgive me, but this is not meant to be a pun, but C. S. Lewis nailed it! Jim Broadbent saw its integrity and delivered it with eloqeunce to the screen. The actors chosen for their roles excelled in their parts and Disney projected the story in the light that C. S. Lewis would have been humbled to see.It has been long over due for a juvenile fiction of this greatness to come to the screen and this one was done well by Disney and in my opinion eclipses Beauty and the Beast and provides entertainment for adults as well.Look for the message!  There is a message within the message!\n",
      "This has to be one of the best movies I have seen, and one of the best movies adapted from a book I have seen, Congratulations to the director! This is an amazing film and highly recommended in DVD format too - it is something I will be watching again and again.The movie is very faithful to the book which is great. The opening scenes of the film do set a scene which is not in the book although they do help to reinforce why Edmund is so surly with his family. It is war time and he is missing his father dreadfully. The four children (Peter, Susan, Edmund and lucy) are sent to the country to stay with the professor and his very rigid housekeeper.They quickly become bored but try to be good - and play hide and seek. Lucy finds a wardrobe full of fur coats and slips inside - only there is no back to the wardrobe and she slips into the world of Narnia which you can get to through the back of the Wardrobe. It is winter there and she meets Mr Tumnis, a faun who takes her back to his house for tea. (Perhaps not the best message to be sending children in this day and age! yet quite in keeping with the time and genre)When Lucy returns to through the wardrobe she has been away overnight in Narnia, but has only been gone a few seconds in real time. None of the other children believe her story of having gone away, and the wardrobe seems solid. Lucy however is determined to go back, and this time when she goes Edmund follows her but loses her on the other side. He gets pickedup by the white witch who feeds him sweeties (sweets were rationed in Britain during wartime so they would have been a very powerful bribe for a small boy!) and manages to convince him to bring his brother and 2 sisters back to Narnia - Edmund also reveals that Mr Tumnis has harboured his sister.The four children eventually slip into Narnia and the action really begins, Mr Tumnis has been arrested by the secret police (a very scary pack of wolves) and the children are rescued by a pair of cockney beavers who take them to Aslan.Their adventures in Narnia are very much a parable for the crucifixion, Aslan gives up his life for Edmund, to be humiliated and killed on the stone table. Yet, in allowing himself to be a willing sacrifice for man he allows Narnia to survive.This is also all about love, forgiveness and loyalty. The four children are torn by their desire simply to get back to their own world once they have found Edmund again yet they also understand that they must help Narnia fight its battle against the White Witch, who is stronger, and has more troops (and very scary ones at that)The film is amazing. From the animals such as the faun Tumnis and the centaurs (on an intimate scale) to the large army of repellent creatures which the white queen had. On a particular note, I was especially amazed by the two polar bears the queen had pulling her chariot.I felt the children were very well chosen for the parts. They looked appropriate for their roles and they were excellent actors. The actor who played Mr Tumnis was a real scene stealer - utterly superb in the part and just how one would expect a faun to act.It is a longish movie, and quite frightening in parts. It is not something I would want my young children to see but once they get older this is definitely a movie I would like them to see and understand.Just on a final note. Adamsom has learnt a lot from his animation - the shrek movies are amazing, and he has transferred that skill here - the changing perspectives are wonderful. The battle scenes were extraodinary - there is the opening scene where the griffin is flying over the batte field and the camera appears to follow it in its swooping flight path. The scene that keeps coming to my mind mostly when I think of Adamson's skill is where the two armies are galloping towards each other with Peter at the fore. There is music playing as Peter begins his charge, then as they get closer you see them from the side - the two armies drawing nearer and the music finishes to nothing more than a heart beat - it is almost silence. I can hardly describe what I felt to see this, the anticipation is heightened and the drama of it. I felt my heart rise to my throat and realised I was crying. It was at once beautiful and horrible.This is a well crafted film on all levels - the adaptation of the book, the choice of actors, the animation, the direction and, well - everything. I enjoyed it immensely and will be watching it again and again.\n",
      "Awesome film, great to watch with the family, great movie for the kids. Check out the books by C.S. Lewis if your a fan of the films. Awesome series.\n",
      "I was skeptical but was very pleasantly surprised. I would recommend this to anyone from 4 to 1004!\n",
      "This movie is truely awesome!!!!! The way how they created the wolves, Aslan and the beavers and the other animals was truely amazing. It had a GREAT plot to it. I LOVE Aslan the lion. AND when they killed Aslan and his came back to life the next day, it was like when Jesus was killed and he came back in 3 days. Aslan is truely the best lion! And just to let you know this movie, this is based on bible books and stuff like that. It does have a witch in it, which of course is the bad guy. Aslan is the one that defeats her! The movie is awesome and I love the animals. The kids were great too! I think that Lucy is cute! But my favorite is Susan. But I like Aslan out of the animals.You MUST watch this!!!! It's worth your money!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie were sent away from London into the country to stay with \"the Professor\" and avoid the London bombings during World War II. Just like a lot of other kids. The similarity with other kids ends right there.While playing hide-and-seek, Lucy (the youngest) discovers an old wardrobe in one of the rooms upstairs and hides in it, only to discover that the back of the wardrobe is a gateway into a snow-covered world which is ever so different from the one she left behind. The first \"person\" she meets is Mr. Tumnus, a faun. (He is, by the way, a most charming fellow.) He explains that it has been winter in Narnia for 100 years, ever since the Snow Queen took over. \"Always winter but never Christmas.\" How could a child imagine anything more dismal than that?When Lucy goes back through the wardrobe, thinking she had been gone for several hours, she runs out into the stairway shouting, \"I'm here! I'm all right!\" The others accuse her of not understanding the game of hide-and-seek, as to them, she was only gone a moment. The dismiss her story of having been to Narnia as imagination, and who could blame them? It is clear that the professor knew about the magic in the wardrobe, because he perked up and became very interested earlier when only Lucy had been through, and the others told him that she had been telling some tall tale about going through it into a magical world. He argues that since she is not mad, and not given to lying, they might just believe her.When Lucy goes back to the wardrobe in the middle of the night, Edmund follows her, and discovers that it's all true. Before he catches up with Lucy, however, a white sleigh drawn by white reindeer drives up with the Snow Queen. She plies Edmund with hot chocolate and Turkish delight, and tells him to go back and get his brother and sisters. You see, there is this prophecy . . .Anyway, all four children eventually get to Narnia dressed in fur coats that had been hanging in the wardrobe, and encounter a couple of talking beavers who take them to their home and tell them all about the prophecy. Two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve will be the ones to rescue Narnia from the clutches of the Snow Queen. However, Edmund slips out to go find the Queen, and from there on, I'd be telling too much.You know about Aslan, no doubt. He's a large and very magical lion who is a rather obvious metaphor for Jesus Christ, right down to being slain and reborn. An army of assorted magical creatures is gathered on the side of Narnia, and some truly grotesque demons and nasty animals (wolves, most notably, and Minotaurs and all sorts of vicious beings, including a few giants) fighting for the Queen. There's a huge battle, all sorts of exciting incidents involved in it, and of course the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve fulfill the prophecy and become kings and queens.Many years later, when they are all fully grown, they come across the lamppost that stands outside the \"back door,\" if you will, of the wardrobe. They go through, and come tumbling out the front of the wardrobe, back in the Professor's home, and still children. When asked to explain to the professor what they have been up to, Peter says, \"If we told you, you wouldn't believe us.\" The professor tosses something (I couldn't see what) to Peter and says, \"Try me.\"It's a marvelous movie made from a marvelous book, and I hope they eventually make all seven of the books in the series into movies.\n",
      "I am not a fan of fantasy films.  I dislike them intensely.  I went to this movie because I had to bring my high school students to it and I was amazed!  I loved this movie.  Right from the very beginning, I was hooked!  The special effects were incredible!  The photography: excellent!  The characters were believable. The music was a wonderful accompaniment to the story line...it did not overpower it or compete with it.If this movie does not walk away with every award possible, I will be discouraged with the American people.As an English teacher in a high school, I can not stress the beauty, relevance and overall excellence of this movie. Five stars!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "This is a great translation of the book 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'!  Aislyn is such a strong character.\n",
      "I would buy a Narnia movie anytime,anywhere. I love the Narnia series! I have read the entire C.S. Lewis Narnia books several times, even to purchasing the entire set for all of my grandchildren. There's a special magic in the Disney movie version.I think Disney captures the relationship between the each of the children and Aslan extremely well.My favorite line is when Lucy asks Aslan if she'll ever see him again. He replies that in her country, he's known by another name. She should get to know him by that name.  I hope Disney completes the movie series. This review could be about any of the Disney Narnia movies.\n",
      "I read this book when I was a child and this movie really did it justice.  Amazing special effects and make-up.\n",
      "Having first read the Chronicles of Narnia in 1979, I had grave misgivings when I heard a movie was being made. I wasn't only concerned about issues such as special effects and where they'd film the movie -- Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies were showing that wasn't much of a problem in the 21st century. I was mostly concerned about the tone and feel of the books, which are charmingly anachronistic.I didn't need to worry after all: The live action The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, if it takes some small liberties with the book, gets the tone and feel of the book perfectly, giving us a battle between good and evil that feels on one level like a children's story, while at the same time having obvious deeper currents to it, some of which can be puzzled out thematically, others of which will (mostly) be revealed in later stories.The casting was also exceptionally well done, with all of the children actually looking like siblings and like real children (not Hollywood actor children creatures) besides. Tilda Swinton is especially good as the White Witch, who plays evil with a sophistication and intelligence rarely seen in movies.For adults, there's also great fun in spotting some of the celebrity voices of the wonderfully animated talking animals. Rupert Everett as the talking fox was an especially witty choice, and perfectly suited to the role.In the end, as long as the film was, it suffers a bit from being an adaptation of a relatively short children's novel, and feels significantly thinner than, say, Peter Jackson's much denser Fellowship of the Ring. This isn't a crippling blow to the movie -- it's still quite enjoyable and makes one eager for the next movie in the series -- but it does mean the film doesn't really bear the repeated rewatchings the extended editions of the Lord of the Rings movies do.Strongly recommended for fantasy fans of all ages and the original Narnia books.\n",
      "This is a great movie, especially if you have read the book, because it stays pretty close! My kids loved it!\n",
      "I love the quality of Blu-ray DVDs in general, and this Blu-ray DVD was of the highest quality. The animals look so real and sound quality is amazing. I was slightly disappointed in the lack of a pop-up menu that most new Blu-ray DVDs have as a standard feature. In this one, the menu takes up the whole screen with a PIP (Picture in Picture) window showing the movie up in the corner. Overall, I am happy with this purchase and the online price was reasonable (and better than the price at Best Buy).\n",
      "This is very much a child's film that parents should never have any fear of taking home to their family. It's not as grave, or complex, as The Lord of the Rings, and will appeal to both younger children as well as adolescents. At some level, they will all get something out of seeing it. The interplay between good and evil is timeless and as easy to comprehend as anything they might see on a Christmas special. Narnia is a most rewarding tale whose values children may hopefully internalize. Traits like duty, honor, loyalty, and sacrifice are ones of which our society is in great need, and C.S. Lewis identifies and expounds on them here in noble fashion. Perhaps, viewers will be stimulated by the beauty of the story and take a look at his excellent written works like Mere Christianity.\n",
      "The Pevensie family must split-up due to the war and the children go to the country for safety. There Lucy while playing a game of “Hide-and-seek” discovers an old wardrobe in a spare room. There upon entering stumble into the country of Narnia. The story begins.If you come at this film with no preconceptions or knowledge of the writer or writing. And of course did not see the BBC production, than you could almost perceive this film tale as a mild “Lord of the rings.” We have the cultural classic coming of age journey that requires sacrifice and a new understanding of life.The original BBC production truer to the story was of course lower budget and would appeal to a different audience. I think Disney adjusted this film to match their perceived audience.The book which is a classic also has a following. However I must say that I think that C.S. Lewis’s fictional works are a pail reflection of his other works.I did find the film fun to watch especially after viewing the voiceover commentaries that told what they were trying to accomplish including the “Potty Mouth Bucket”. And this was a good selection of character actors. The sets had great depth and care taken. Yet this is an interpretation of a book that is bay an author that is not the best at fiction and should in no way be compared with other works either book or movie. Dismay is trying to portray the essence of the story, not make a block buster action CGI film. In those contents this movie was well done.Watch for “The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian” (2007)As a side note I own wardrobe similar although not as large as the one displayed in the movie. So foe the only being that have been lost in it are my cats.\n",
      "I saw the Chronicles of Narnia in 3-D on my own TV.  I found a new kind of 3-D glasses on eBay called TV Eyes.  It's not holographic 3-D, but it doesn't require the movie to be specially filmed, it works right off a regular dvd like this one!  And it was awesome!  Aslan looked real, you wanted to touch him. All of the creatures looked more realistic, even the humans.  Everything had more shape. Distances looked farther away. And crowd scenes were more detailed. I really loved the scene where the kids were walking into Aslan's camp for the first time.  You could see everything so clearly, each individual creature and tent.  If you haven't seen this in 3-D, buy a copy and go get a pair of TV Eyes off eBay.  This movie is a fantasy classic, both in story and in how well it was made. It deserves to be seen in it's best possible presentation.\n",
      "This modern interpretation of the classic children's story The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe (the most well-known--though not actually the first--book of CS Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia) is a fairly accurate adaptation that retains the magical feel of the original work.  The world of Narnia comes alive through today's wonderful special effects, with creatures such as fawns and talking beavers blending seamlessly with the human actors.  And speaking of the latter, the four child actors all do a perfectly credible job, although the youngest two come across the most naturally on the big screen.  The supporting cast also performs well, from Tilda Swinton's icy portrayal of the White Witch to Liam Neeson's majestically-voiced Aslan.  The movie certainly has plenty of adult appeal, yet at its heart, it is still a fantasy story intended mainly for all but the youngest children (the death of Aslan and ensuing battle scene notwithstanding).This 2-Disc Collector's Edition is beautifully packaged but probably only for the most devoted fans.  I enjoyed the \"Bloopers\" included on Disc 1--more than just actual bloopers, these scenes show the actors simply goofing around, with the green screens everywhere providing a glimpse into how the special effects are acheived--but the plethora of footage on Disc 2 (including in-depth information on the creatures of Narnia) was a bit more than I needed.  Certainly this set takes full advantage of the wonders of DVD format, and those who relish these bonuses will have plenty to take pleasure from here.  Overall, this might not go down in history as being a great film, but it is certainly well-done and definitely worth seeing.\n",
      "What a beautiful movie. If you watch this and don't understand the whole meaning behind it you just are lost.\n",
      "A wonderful C.S. Lewis classic has finally come to the screen successfully. The acting and the music were wonderful. Even childen should be able to enjoy this.\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a great fantasy movie for younger and older audiences alike. This is a great story and the director did a good job of taking C.S. Lewis' ideas and putting them on film. However, I believe this film is geared toward a younger audience. I like to think of it as a PG rated version of The Lord of the Rings.\n",
      "A big fan of the chronicles. The price was reasonable, shipping was timely, and the product was new as stated. There were no problems\n",
      "My only regret is that I did not see this one in the theater! When I was but a youg reader, I was absolutly captivated by this book. While the film was not 100% true to the novel, it was spellbinding none the less!If I had to chose a fav role, it would have to brave little Lucy. She was never afraid to push on, to do what needed to be done. I think we could all learn form that role.One aspect that I enjoyed about this movie was what wasn't in it. There was no cursing, I hate cursing in films. There were battle scenes minus the gore. It truly is possible to portray warfar without being graffic in nature. I liked the fact that the film was not pushing a political agenda or philosophy. It was just a very good enjoyable film that I would recommend to anyone of any age!\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a great family film that I watched with my 5yr old and 2yr old and it held their interest the entire time.  I don't recall the book (read it 25 years ago) but the movie was great.  Narnia is a beautiful place and all of C.S. Lewis' characters are wonderfully done.  The actors that play the kids could have been better but they do a good job.  The fight at the end isn't that intense, but the execution of Aslan is pretty rough for kids.  This film is definitely one to add to the collection.\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Full Screen Edition) is a brilliant adaptation of C.S Lewis novel with the same title. The special effects are amazing and the music likewise. The movie is very faithful to the novel and only diverges at small parts. The Christian allegory is everywhere to be found. Aslan as the savior, Lucy and Susan being the women at the cross and so many more. Truly an amazing movie that should be enjoyed by fantasy movie lovers of all ages. I very much enjoyed it. Highly recommended. 5/5.\n",
      "I was really excited when I found that \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" was being made into a movie. So last weekend I watched the movie and it was pretty good but nothing really to write home about. The movie is long and I started to become bored towards the middle of it. I didn't care too much for the children except for Lucy who was an absolute doll. In the fighting seen there were a few gryphons who were turned into stone while in flight and crashed into pieces. I wonder if Aslan was able to bring them back to life? Who knows. The White Witch had the craziest hairstyles and her wardrobe could've been better. Other than that, the movie's pretty good with some boring moments.\n",
      "`The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe', cowritten and directed by Andrew Adamson, is a story based on the first of seven books for adolescents by the 20th century scholar, poet, and Christian apologist, C. S. Lewis. It is a great coincidence that this movie would probably not have been made, or at least not made now, if it were not for the great success of the three `The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. The coincidence is that not only were the two authors, C. S. Lewis and J.R.R.Tolkien great friends, they were literally colleagues as dons at Oxford in very similar disciplines. And, they both read one another's poems and fiction as avidly as they probably read one another's scholarly works.In the final analysis, I feel this movie holds the same relation to the `...Rings' movies as the books do when I read them for the first time over 40 years ago. Tolkien's great novel (it is not really a trilogy) is a great epic fantasy that no amount of scholarship can cleanly map it to worldly events or concerns. This disconnect from the world of the mid-20th century is clear from many of the author's pronouncements. Lewis' series, on the other hand is a loosely connected series of seven stories of significantly lesser dramatic merit and the stories are all directly and pretty obviously written as advertisements for Christian doctrines. A quick look at Lewis' other major works such as `The Screwtape Letters' and `Mere Christianity' will give one a quick sense that Christian doctrine was front and center in all of Lewis' non-academic works. The problem is that while this allegory may help communicate Christian doctrine, it tends to spoil the story from a literary and dramatic point of view.That is not to say this is a poor movie. In fact, I would rate the quality of the moviemaking to be even superior to the various `Harry Potter' films, at least for the first half of the Narnia story. I will even go so far as to say it rivals the quality of `Lord of the Rings' right up to the appearance of the Father Christmas character, which immediately takes the whole level of storytelling down a notch and lets the sour note of `deux ex machina' into the tale. This `happy accident' escape from peril may be one of the reasons Peter Jackson took the Tom Bombadil chapters out of `The Fellowship of the Ring' screenplay, aside from the fact that this episode did little to move the story forward.A quick look at the published volume of `The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe' will reveal that it is a really rather thin book, and the filmmakers did a great job of bulking it up. The problem is that there is absolutely none of the depth we find in the `...Rings' story.This is the first of seven short novels where the principle characters are four young English children who find themselves entwined in the legends of a mysterious world accessed through the back of a wardrobe in a spare room of a country manor house. The principle antagonists in this land of Narnia are the human White Witch, leading an assortment of talking animals and mythical creatures and Aslan, a speaking lion who is the nominal leader of another band of talking animals and mythical creatures. There is little logic to which creatures side with the witch and which side with Aslan, so you soon stop caring that centaurs are good guys and minotaurs are bad guys.The heart of the matter is the Christian story of a nominal `king' sacrificing himself willingly for the lives and salvation of sinners, only to be reborn, raise dead creatures (petrified by the White Witch) back to life, and thereby carry the field of battle with the evil witch. My problem with the storytelling is that all this is played out in the foreground with very little narrative groundwork laid for the premise of the whole story. In contrast, you know in chapter 2 of `The Fellowship of the Ring' what the peril is and how it must be faced and resolved 32 long chapters later. On top of all this, in spite of the heavy and well documented borrowing from northern European myths, the `...Rings' story is remarkably cohesive, hanging together well from chapter to chapter, slowly building on its firm internal logic to a most satisfying conclusion.On the other hand, the `Narnia' story is so thin, the bare bones of all the borrowings and similarities to the likes of `Alice in Wonderland', `The Wizard of Oz', Christmas lore, mythical Greek creatures, and the Bible seem to stick out here and there. Thus, `The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' remains a very good young teenager's story, the best of the series by far.Before Peter Jackson got the rights to `Lord of the Rings', my greatest fear was that Disney would get the rights and do a `nice' version of the story. I had the same fear with this movie, but I am happy to say that they brought their great skill, but not their saccharine outlook to this story. All through the first half of the film, I was totally hooked by the quality of the filmmaking and the acting by the four young leads. I was convinced that this was far better than `Harry Potter' and a true rival to `...Rings'. I was especially liking the portrayal of Jadis, the witch. But then, the weaknesses in the story started unraveling the fabric of my belief in the characters and their situation when the `just in time' rescues started playing out.The extras on the DVD are a bit better than average. The cutsie `fun facts' add-in is very nice, but none of the material seems to give proper center stage to author Lewis' Christian theme.\n",

      "Young Lucy Pevenise, along with her older brothers Edmund and Peter, and her older sister, Susan, are in London during the initial bombing raids of WW II. And like many families of the time, the parents decide to send them to the country for safer keeping. Peter, the oldest, is told by their mother to \"watch over them\" and make sure they stay safe. And although this seems like a fairly simple request, Peter's ability to protect his siblings will be put to the ultimate test. But not by WW II, but by an amazing secret discovered by young Lucy.Soon after being spirited into the company of a hermit-like professor's care (Jim Broadbent), they decide to play hide-and-seek, and it's during this game which Lucy discovers a mysterious wardrobe. She tucks herself inside and backs to the rear of the cabinet ...only to discover herself in an entirely different world. Here she meets up with Mr. Tumnus, a strange half-stag, half-human creature who explains much about the wintry landscape Lucy now finds herself in. The place is called Narnia, and it's been locked in winter for over 100 years by someone known as \"The White Witch\" (who claims to be the Queen of Narnia).Lucy, excited beyond words, rushes back to \"the real world\" to tell her brothers and sister about what she's discovered and, of course, they don't believe her ...until they all get into the wardrobe one day and find out she's been telling the truth.Soon a prophecy is revealed to the two brothers and two sisters: it is said that when Aslan returns, two daughters of Eve and two sons of Adam will come back and reclaim the four thrones of Narnia. But first they have to battle The White Witch, struggle with the internal dynamics of sibling rivalries, and face the death of the very creature who helped create this strange world.______________________________________________________________________________Comparisons abound between NARNIA and THE LORD OF THE RINGS. And why not. Both are fantasy tales. Both authors (Lewis and Tolkien) were friends during the same era. And both stories have recently made it to the silver screen. And although my heart still rests with THE LORD OF THE RINGS, NARNIA deserves much praise.But this praise doesn't necessarily come from me...I went to the theater today (a weekend) and it was packed with children (ranging in age from their teens to five years old), and while watching it I noticed something intriguing: not a single interruption occurred during the entire 140 minutes. No crying child asking to go home; no temper tantrums; no shushing of mothers and fathers to their kids. I think this speaks pretty highly of how engaged this film kept its intended audience. I will say that when Aslan became \"injured\" there were gasps of dismay from a couple of kids behind me and they quietly asked their mother if \"Aslan was going to be okay\" (I have to admit, that was pretty cute).Georgie Henley (Lucy) was exquisite as one of the prime characters (move over Dakota Fanning). Her acting was spot-on and brought a lump to my throat several times. Liam Neeson's Aslan voice was also perfect with its deep resonance that seemed to echo through the theater (must've been a good sound recording). Tilda Swinton was also excellent as the sinister White Witch who rules Narnia with a cold, iron fist. And James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus was also pulled off very well.There've been several reviews (professional) that have been critical of the film's Christian-based theological leanings. Well ...yes. That's true. It does have that, but so did C.S. Lewis' Narnia Chronicles novels. So did this bother me? Not at all. I don't prescribe to any particular faith, and if you go into NARNIA with an anti-religious chip on your shoulder, I'm sure you could rip the film apart. But if you go into the theater strictly to enjoy good storytelling and for entertainment, you'll probably delight in NARNIA just as much as the ten-year-old who sat behind me quietly throughout the entire movie.\n",
      "I just wanted to clarify to potential buyers that the 4-disc version includes ALL of the special features that are included in the 2-disc version as well as several additional features and the slightly longer cut of the film. So if you are a die-hard fan, there is no reason to purchase the 2-disc version if you own the 4-disc version. I personally rate the quality of the film 3 1/2 stars.\n",
      "My granddaughter had read the book, but wanted to see the movie. We watched it on my kindle fire. We both had an awesome time.Best things in life are so simple.\n",
      "This is a great movie, but it will not play right on my blu-ray player. However, I play it on my Ps3 and it works like it normally should...Update: just put it in the ps3 and it started skipping in their, so theirs something wrong with the blu-ray... :( Going to have to buy a new one again and I only owned this since april :( lasted 5 months and played it like 4 or so times :(\n",
      "It would have been very easy to screw this movie up. Amazingly they didn't and it's a pleasure to watch. It stays true to the storyline and the tone of the book. Well done.\n",
      "Overall, this is a fine film. But no film can ever be as good as it's original source - the book - nor can it compete with nostalgia if you are one of many, many who read the book as a child. Also keep in mind, the book is a CHILDREN's book, a thin little thing packed with imagination but not a lot of details that could be translated into cinema.Viewing this movie as an adult, I realize I'm tainted by the stuffed-to-the-gills ever-escalating action, drama, and suspense of modern cinema, needing to be stimulated for every frame of film, including the credits just so I'll stick around and happen to read the names of all the people who put in some hard work to entertain me for two hours. If I expect a modern epic, I'll be sorely disappointed. But if I watch this film as a classic retelling (and the best rendition to date) of a beautiful children's tale, I'm delighted. It's also refreshing just to sit back and enjoy a story without being jolted by garish imagery or jarred by frenetic music jamming the urgency of the scene into my ears.As for Christian overtones, all I see is a universally heroic act of one creature's sacrifice to save others, usurping an evil magic - and magic is all the rage with this generation. The story is fun, sends a good message about family and forgiveness, and has a typical fantasy ending. The evil threat is menacing, but not so dark it glorifies. The CG and actors blend well. The costuming is detailed and believable.As I said, nothing can live up to the cherished memories of nostalgia. That's why I give this movie four stars instead of the five it deserves. It's worthing owning the dvd.\n",
      "This is a wonderful adventure, My son loved it and it is one of the best of the Narnia stories.\n",
      "This movie is beautifully done. I don't deny that. But if you read the book, and are looking for a film that follows it closely, you are much better off with the older 1979 animated version.If you're on this site, you probably already know the basic story. The 4 children Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy move into the country to escape the bombings in London during WW II. Lucy finds the kingdom of Narnia behind the wardrobe. Edmund (a bit bratty) taunts her for it, and continues to deny it even when he sees it. Eventually all 4 make it into Narnia where they learn that there is an evil queen who always makes certain that it's always winter and never Christmas. However, there is hope. Aslan the Christ Lion is coming to put an end to her power.Edmund (not knowing what to think) defects to the evil queen. However, he has a change of heart. Then to save Edmund, Aslan has to go through the agony and sorrow of Good Friday. But then the glorious joy of Easter Sunday follows. And then comes the task of putting an end to the evil queen.The strange thing about this version is that it's beautifully done. (No doubt.) But the 1979 version was an hour shorter and it  followed the book more accurately,  The strange thing about this newer movie is that it's an hour longer than the 1979 animated version. And with all the things they add, they took out some really important things. (Things included in the 1979 animated version mind you.)If you just read the book or watched the 1979 animated version, you're probably going to notice many things missing.(1) The part when the professor explains to Susan and Peter that Narnia could very well have a time of its own that doesn't take any of our time, (2) The part where Mr. and Mrs. Beaver explain the prophecy involving Cair Paravel as well as how the queen would like for everyone to THINK she's human, (3) The part where Aslan and the queen chat and Mr. Beaver offers a moment of recognition as to how the queen thought she had the right of Narnia.I don't want to get into EVERY difference, because then this review will go on forever. But it is strange that while this recent movie is an hour longer than the 1979 animated version, they would cut out key moments like these.One minor complaint I have is that Edmund is not nasty enough in the 1st half. It's because Edmund is so nasty in the 1st half, that his redemption is so underlined once the halfway  point hits. After being so nasty for so long, he pleads for the lives of the animals having a picnic. It's Edmund's very nasty early character that makes it so powerful when C.S. Lewis writes: \"And Edmund for the first time in this story felt sorry for someone besides himself.\" (To say nothing of the fact that in the end, it's Edmund who rises from his nasty past, shows extreme courage, and risks himself to destroy the power of the evil queen.)But like I said, it is a very beautifully done movie. The scenery and costumes are nice. And despite it's 2 1/2 hour length, the film moves at a great pace. And there is no denying that Liam Neeson gives Aslan the perfect voice.I'm just saying that as beautiful and great as the film is, don't expect it to follow the book so closely.\n",
      "The film is a good translation of the 2nd book, sorry Scorpio but the 1st book was the magicians nephew not Lion. I am really looking forward to seeing how the rest of the books (total of 7)come out. Just an FYI, there are several books that have been done as live action by BBC, Lion, The Silver chair, Prince caspian & Voyage of dawn treader. Im fairly sure IIRC that tom baker plays a character in the Silver Chair story. Also have been I believe at least 2 animated versions of Lion out, or soon to be available. Anyway if your interested in seeing the BBC take on the tales and have Netflix they have all 4 of the the BBC Narnia tales to tide you over, hehe\n",
      "First off I want to start by saying this movie was very well made. C.S. Lewis' book really comes to life. The creatures and the white witch are all brilliantly portrayed. I read that Walden Media is the one who kept Narnia true to the novel and I for one am glad they made this film. Almost the whole thing matches up to the book. I am 15 years old and my dad and I both read these books and loved the movie. The film caught your attention from the first moment and never let go until it was over ,and even after it was over you still keep thinking about it. Aslan was as strong and majestic as he is in the book. You do not need to have read the book to love and enjoy the movie, although some pieces may be a little confusing. Georgie Henley as Lucy was great she is a star in the making. The other actors are also very good but didn't steal the show like Georgie. Although the film is rated PG the battle scene and the scene where Aslan is killed Might be pretty scary for younger kids. I assure you if you see this movie you will not be disappointed. This movie will be a favorite for many generations to come.My family and I all hope that they make all seven books into movies.\n",
      "I love C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia series and I was very excited when this movie came out.  I was even more excited that they were true to the book and adds very little to the movie story line.  I understand movies need to change a few things to make the visual story line move along, but the producer of this movie didn't see a need to do that and the movie follows the book almost 100%.  It is by far the closest to the book as compared to the other Narnia movies that have been produced (Prince Caspian, which followed about 85% of the book, and Voyage of the Dawn Treader, which followed about 60% of the book).  I hope for future Narnia movies they get back to trying to stay closer to the book story lines which I believe most fans of the series would like to see.  Maybe that is why this is my favorite movie of all the Narnia movies so far.\n",
      "This video is worth every penny.  Video/audio quality is outstanding.  One of the best Blu Ray movies I have seen.\n",
      "I was truly taken aback by the quality of this production and consider it to be the best non-animated film that Disney has ever produced. The acting is incredible, the special effects are phenomenal, and the story is wonderfully compelling. It mirrors the book very closely, though does have some noticeable, though rather harmless differences. I would point these out, but I don't want to ruin this amazing movie for people who haven't seen it. In my opinion, the differences enhance the movie rather than detract from it. There are many Christian themes in it that I greatly enjoyed--such as forgiveness--that are very powerful. Even people who have no prior interest in movies with fantasy characters, such as my mother (who loved the movie), will most likely find the profoundness of the story more compelling than the strangeness of the creatures. If you are looking for a great movie that incorporates Christian themes into a truly unique and extraordinary story, look no farther than the Chronicles of Narnia.\n",
      "This is an excellent version of \"The Lion, the Witch & the Wardrobe\". It is in wide screen format and includes additional scenes. The additional scenes in the battle were very well done, although the scene where Peter skewers a harpy in flight with a spear while riding at a full gallop stretches even this fantasy a bit - but it looked great!The additional features were also very good. I especially liked the biography of CS Lewis. All in all, this was a wonderful package.\n",
      "Nominated for three Academy Awards, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe follows on the heels of recent successful big screen adaptations of other childrens' fantasy novels such as The Lord of the Rings books and the Harry Potter series. But while each of these series feature underlying tones of Christian symbolism, The Chronicles of Narnia is overtly intended as a Christian allegory. Written by the brilliant 20th Century Oxford and Cambridge literature professor C.S. Lewis, the Narnia stories were a tribute to his deep Christian faith. And this big screen transition is something of which he can be proud. Directed by Andrew Adamson, veteran director of the Shrek franchise, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe is a master blend of traditional human acting and computer generated imagery.The film follows the exploits of the four Pevensie children, two brothers and two sisters. Set during the early years of World War II, their mother sends them away to the countryside in order to escape the relentless Nazi bombing raids on London. Left to their own devices in the cavernous mansion of Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent), they engage in a traditional game of hide-and-seek, whereupon the youngest of children, Lucy (Georgie Henley) crawls into a lone wardrobe stationed in an otherwise empty room. Backing her way through the garments, she stumbles into a wintry wonderland where she encounters a faun named Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy).Initially, Mr. Tumnus tries to kidnap the young girl, but he experiences a change of heart due to the kindness of her spirit. As a result, he reveals to her the truth about the land into which she stumbled. Narnia is dominated by the evil White Witch who claims to be ruler of the forest, but the true ruler is a lion named Aslan who prophesied long ago that two \"sons of Adam\" and \"daughters of Eve\" would usher in the end of the one hundred year darkness administered by the White Witch. Knowing the prophecy, the witch intends to murder the children upon their arrival. But when Lucy relays the facts of the adventure to her family, they don't believe her.Despite their initial reservations, her older siblings - Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Susan (Anna Popplewell), and Peter (William Moseley) - all find their way into the magical land of Narnia. With talking trees, a forest filled with danger, and an evil witch in hot pursuit, the Pevensie kids must navigate their way through the treacherous land in order to find Aslan (Liam Neeson), the Messianic lion king who can help them to fulfill their rightful destiny as heirs to the thrones of Narnia...Aided by an outstanding soundtrack which perfectly compliments each sequence of events, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe is an inspiring film of epic proportions. For Christians, it will have significant meaning far in excess of a traditional film. For instance, the climatic scene of the film in which Aslan provides the ultimate sacrifice will evoke images of Roman soldiers beating and mocking Jesus in the hours leading up to his crucifixion. It's undeniably the most powerful scene of the film. Meanwhile, Georgie Henley turns in an unforgettable performance as the innocent and playful Lucy. Her charisma exudes from the screen in a manner rarely common to child actors. This performance is complimented by Tilda Swinton who is magnificently cast in the role of the White Witch. She simultaneously displays the satanic traits of seductive beauty and ruthless cunning with heavenly perfection. Add a final battle sequence reminiscent of Braveheart, and you've got a blockbuster movie the whole family can enjoy. Although parents of small children who scare easily should take note that some of the scenes can be frightening, but probably no more frightening than Darth Vader and the aliens from Star Wars. Nevertheless, parents should preview the film before introducing it to young children. Overall, this first film in The Chronicles of Narnia series is well worth any movie-goer's attention...\n",
      "For a non-reader of the booksIts a great fantasy story that an entire family can enjoy. If you like the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Harry Potter series, then you will enjoy The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.\"For a reader of the books:A fairly accurate portrayal of the book. Any license the movie takes actually compliments the overall story and it helps those who haven't read the books.The special affects were great. Aslan was wonderfully done.\n",
      "I bought a quantity of these for the children at my church.  They seemed very happy with the gift, and it was easy working with Amazon.\n",
      "The blu-ray Narnia is the best in dvds. It's good entertainment for the whole family.\n",
      "I was not impresed with the book when I read it earlier this year, so I didn't have much excitement for this movie, so you can imagine my surprise when I noticed I was totally engrossed in the movie.  The first 45 minutes of the film are prefect.  Perfect!  I can't think of one thing that could make it any better.  The introduction of the children and their discovery of Narnia is done so beautifully that I think I could watch it over and over again for years and years.  It's charming, magical, filled with fantasy and an ease of storytelling that is rarely seen in these kinds of big-budget Hollywood franchise builders.Strangely, once the main plot of the story gets underway, the stroy begins to drag a bit and never fully recovers, but the characters that I connected with beforehand kept me interested and right with them to the exciting climax.The story does have a lot of violence but it's not gratuitous and no blood is shown (though I think a bit more realism in this area would make the film better).  There is plenty in the film to make small children frightened.  In fact I heard a few begin to to cry at various times in the theater.  Still, I think most children over 8 will enjoy the film immensley.  If your children were fine watching the Harry Potter films, then they should have no trouble watching The Chronicles of Narnia as well.The DVD is jam-packed with extras including features dedicated to the director, the child actors and practically every character in the story.  You'll not only learn abut how the movie was shot and props were made, but you'll also get fun glimpses backstage like the fun song the cast made during the filming.  At times, the extras disc is so comprehensive that I felt like I was watching the bonus material for The Lord Of The Rings but fun things like the song keep popping up and kept me entertained.  Also included are a virtual map with descriptions of each area and a timeline that visualizes the the difference from our world and Narnia.People of all ages and interests are sure to enjoy not only the wonderful movie but the highly entertaining bonus material as well.\n",
      "Based on the classic novel from C.S. Lewis, this film is destined to become a classic in its own right. It is a family- type movie that parallels the book very closely as it follows four kids on their journey to the land of Narnia where they find themselves locked in a battle between good and evil.There are many reasons to enjoy this movie but let's start with the film's strongest point of all: Its special effects and make-up. The land of Narnia is populated with many different creatures, some of whom look mostly human; some which look like ordinary animals; and some who resemble a hybrid between an animal and a person. The special effects offered here are excellent, and the team in charge of making this movie deserves extra credit for making these characters seem so life like. Among the characters that are part human and part animal, the ones that stand out are the man/horse creatures. They feature a man's face, arms, and torso attached to the body of a horse and they look very real. With the creatures that are entirely animalistic- like the two beavers- the special effects are still excellent because the appearance is just like the real thing. And the mouth movements are very realistic- so much so that you forget you are viewing something created in a studio.The most impressive of all the characters is that of Aslan, the Lion. This \"character\" looks just like an actual lion, with a mouth that moves in sync with each word he speaks- exactly like a person who is speaking the same words. Again, the special effects are near- perfect. You cannot tell you are looking at an object created in a Disney studio. It seems very life- like in every way.Besides the excellent special effects, there are many other reasons to enjoy this movie. There is a nice assortment of suspense, humor, fear, and other emotions and many of them come out of nowhere. They keep the film less predictable than it otherwise would be, and that says a lot when you consider that this film is based on a book. I also like the cinematography. The landscape is snowy at first but then switches to a lush, green, mountainous terrain later in the film. This movie was shot in New Zealand (even though it is supposed to take place in England) and the beauty of the New Zealand countryside adds greatly to the film's appeal.Performances in this film are top- notch and I was especially impressed by Georgie Henley, the young actress who plays Lucy. She is the most expressive of the four kid's characters, displaying an array of emotions with conviction, just like a seasoned Hollywood professional. The others are all very good, too, and they all deserve credit for adding so much to this movie.The overall plot of this film is enjoyable and complete- free from any empty holes that leave the viewer puzzled and annoyed. It is also fast- paced, with many scenes depicting fights and open battles as the kids and Aslan take on the evil witch and the various forces of evil.Overall, this is a very good motion picture and the type that most people will find entertaining and memorable. It is great for the entire family, and it will likely be one of the top movies this Holiday season.\n",
      "Movie was delivered quickly. Movie delves in fantasy that young and old can enjoy. No scratches or problems with UMD.\n",
      "This is the first in a series of Narnia movies based on the book written by C.S. Lewis. Movie has amazing special affects and adventure into a new world. This movie is actually based on the second book in the series of \"Chronicles of Narnia\". Certain things in the movie can only be understood if a person has read the first book in the series. Movie does not have language, but it has a lot of violence with mythical characters. C.S. Lewis uses quite a bit of imagery from the Bible for his stories.\n",
      "After 200+ reviews of this film adaptation of one of the best stories ever, you probably do not need another. Let me just say that this movie was excellently done. It remained as true as possible to C.S. Lewis' work (stepson Doug Gresham is co-producer).A fantastic movie. I look forward to the other \"Narnia\" books as sequels.\n",
      "Excellent even more than the average DVD films success! with miles of bonus content and footage. Plus commentary and bonus features for children and the family to enjoy for all ages. If i was to give a chritsmas gift this would be one to remember.\n",
      "Consider all of the great elements: well made, good special effects, engaging storyline, great actors, great source material, and a beautiful soundtrack.  I love Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, but I think this is even better, partly because the makers of this film had the advantage of using a shorter source material, so they could still be faithful without cramming in so much stuff in such a short amount of time.  This film follows almost perfectly well with the book.  I don't see why fans should be disappointed just because the film makes a few changes to the story.  Neither do I see how one could escape the charm of the actors.  The actors do a perfect job at capturing the emotion of the characters.  They really live up to how CS Lewis wanted it to be.  It was just as I imagined it when I read the book.  I was especially pleased with how by staying so true to the book, they remained true to Lewis's powerful message and allegory of Christ.  The battle was very exciting.  Some people have considered the Lord of the Rings trilogy to be the best films ever made, but much as I love Lord of the Rings, this is even better.\n",
      "For avid book lovers once again this may not meet your expectations. I am hoping after you saw the Lord of the Rings series and the Harry Potter series you now understand the movies can never portray everything in the books. If they did we would have to spend days at the movie theater instead of a few hours. They did at least do a great job of bringing most the key elements from the books. I must admit I myself was a little disappointed in the scene when Aslan is slain. My guess is they toned it down a bit for a younger audience. That I guess is not such a bad thing. Overall a great job of putting it together. Good acting, directing, sets, special effects, and music. I recommend it for the whole family. Even the little ones should not be to frightened by this movie. Compared to the original BBC version Disney has jumped to lightspeed in the Millenium Falcon. The special effects in the original BBC version were somewhat cheesy. They meant well and I still enjoy watching them, but they are no match for the caliber of costumes and F/X in this movie.\n",
      "The delivery time was quick and the movie is a classic. One to keep in your library.It also makes a great family movie for all ages.\n",
      "I have to say that this film was tops for my 11 year old daughter and me.  The talking animals were depicted so lifelike and the script stuck close to the original book.  I enjoyed the BBC mini-series of the Chronicles of Narnia that came out many years ago and would still recommemd it for children under 9, as this film had slightly more real looking scarey creatures who served the white witch.  I will definitely see this again before it leaves the theaters!\n",
      "I have not read any of C.S. Lewis' work.  Thus, I entered the movie theater as any movie-goer should, with an absolutely open mind.  What I saw was something I haven't seen since Die Unendliche Geschicht (aka The NeverEnding Story), a deep yet simple and utterly fantastic film which completely captures your imagination and immerses you into a whole new world which is strangely empathic and familiar.The Pevensie children, Peter, Lucy, Edmund, and Susan (William Moseley, Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, and Anna Popplewell) are sent away from the city (I'm assuming it's London) to escape the German night bombing raids sometime in World War II.  They are assigned to live with an introvert Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent) in the countryside.  The children stumble into a mysterious wardrobe which turns out to be a portal into another world, Narnia.Narnia, it seems, has been experiencing winter for the past 100 years.  The White Witch (a chillingly terrific Tilda Swinton) has been ruling the land as a dictator, terrorizing the animal-folk and fantastic creatures with her cold, dark magic.  Standing against her are almost all the creatures of Narnia save wolves, Minotaurs, giants, cyclopses, and dwarves.  Under the rule of the Lion, Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), everything from fauns, centaurs, griffins, cheetahs, rhinos, beavers, to rats prepare to fight against the White Witch.And there always has to be a prophecy... that four humans will arrive to defeat the White Witch.I have heard complaints that the film was too long.  I didn't feel this as the movie completely captured my interest.There's the whole discussion about how Aslan may represent Jesus Christ.  I didn't understand this until I saw the film.  The similarities are evident, especially at the film's most heart-wrenching moment (I should find it strange that I felt more anguish watching a Lion suffer shame than Jim Caviezel).The acting is surprisingly top-notch.  Even Liam Neeson, who has played many a king and knight (even of the Jedi variety) in his career, outdid himself in Narnia.  But most striking of all performances is Tilda Swinton as the White Witch.  She is magnificently cunning and utterly evil here.  Her eyes are dark, empty pools.  It is clear that she is powerful and that the forces of good truly have their work cut out for them to defeat her.Costumes and special effects are the best I've seen to date.  Industrial Light and Magic have proven themselves once again as the frontrunner of computer generated imagery.  As wind blows through the field of battle, feathers on a griffin ruffle appropriately.  These are the most photorealistic effects I have ever seen.  My one gripe is when the girls rode on Aslan's back.  That seemed horrendously fake.  My thoughts go back to Obi-Wan Kenobi riding a giant lizard in Revenge of the Sith which actually seemed more real.As for the battle, I probably would have fought it differently.  But I'm just griping.All in all, this is a perfectly enjoyable film for all ages.  Filled with depth, imagination, and heart, Narnia is a joy to behold.\n",
      "I've already seen this movie twice at the movie theatre, and I absolutely love it. When I read the book, about 2 years ago, I didn't imagine this world as it is displayed in the movie, and it's something I really like, they left something in suspense...It has everything to be a relaxed, funny and exciting movie: from innocent games at their house until incredibly realistic fights with stange creatures and conversations with beavers. The special effects they used now are incredible and putting it all together, becomes an excellent movie with very high quality.The actors who starr the movie, even though they're really young, act really good and when you watch the movie sometimes you feel like you're in the screen, being someone important in the movie.I think this movie reached the objective: 5/5\n",
      "Any of you who know and love the book will find this a rewarding experience. Not so sure if today's kids would be caught up in it the way we were. Really well done.\n",
      "A fascinating movie especially for fantasy movie fans. I am new to fantasy movies.  Never liked them before but I like this movie\n",
      "Excellent DVD.  I'd seen the movie in a theater, but thought that the DVD experience was even better (I didn't have to move my head from left to right to get the entire picture).  Excellent production and quality.\n",
      "I bought this movie for my niece for when she turned eight. She watches it almost every day along with my 6 year old niece. Her parents love the movie too.\n",
      "This such a timeless story and told so well. My granddaughter loves it, so I gave it to her for her 8th birthday!\n",
      "Sensational cinematography! Amazing portrayal of the Gospel message of the death and resurrection of Jesus! We have watched several times and it never gets old!\n",
      "I'm a Narnia fan, so perhaps I'm biased, but I think the extended edition is wonderful.  The additions are subtle, mostly consisting of more landscape shots, but there is one sweet moment on the train in the beginning that you should watch for.  The extra cinematography is fantastic; it really highlights the beauty of the Narnia they created.  The only disappointments to me are that they did not add the coronation ball from which there are outtakes, and they did not use the extended version of the reunion scene between Lucy and Tumnus, which has been on the internet, but not placed in its context within the movie.I can't say much about the extras because I haven't watched them ALL yet, but I watched part of the movie-with-explanation, and it seemed like it is going to be very interesting to watch.And of course, room has been made on my bookshelf for the bookends...\n",
      "The chronicles of narnia is no dout the best film of 2005.  The acting was unbeleveabul.  The special effects were perfect.  The storyline staded true to C.S.Lewis's epic story of good vs evil.  It made me cry when Lucy first ment Mr.Tumnus.  It was beutafeley done.  The muisc in that scene was perfect.  It is one of my faverite picses on the soundtrack.  I also cried when Aslan gave his own life in place of Edmunds.  He looked so sad and helples it that part of the film.  The battle at the end of the film was amazeing.  It was one of my favreite parts in the film.  It may not show blood like a lot of people commplaned about.  But it is still worth wathing.  The battle scene is wright up there with the one's in the lord of the rings films.  There is so mush I can say about this film.  But I dont want to spoll the story.  All I have to say is that the acting is good.  The music is good.  The c.g.i. is good.  This is my faverite film of all time.\n",
      "I've read the book and this film follows it perfectly and does it perfect justice. The acting, special effects, etc. are all great. You want a great fantasy film, then here is one for you now.\n",
      "It has lots of battles and  sword fighting.It has a talking lion .Lucy the 9 year old, Edmen the 12 year old, Susan 15 and Petter 18 year old and Petter's friend in Narnia Caspian .Have you ever saw a talking beaver or talking wolf,it has it here! IMAGEN talking to one. The white witch is trying to get Edmen her king, and replace Edmen's place in the Narnia land, and make it cold, freezing and ice.It use to be in theaters ,now in DVD and blue-ray!watch the cool fighting, see if they die or not. I recommend it for 5 and up, because the fighting might scar them.My favorite part is when the lion is alive in there mind. The sad part is when the lion dies at the lion table.The lion reminds them to go on the journey . Petter king, Susan queen, Edmen prince and Lucy the princess. The had many adventure. But the last one is their last time. will Edmen and Lucy choose to go or to live their life in Narnia? The sad decision makes my eyes water! I give it 5 star's.\n",
      "I love movies n when I saw the price for it. I said to myself that I have to have this movie. I love this movie a lot.\n",
      "This movie was excellent, although I would recommend that the viewers read the books as well.  As several of the reviewers pointed out, there were artistic changes in the plot that detracted from the fullness of the characters.  In addition, for the reviewer mentioned in the subject line, please read The Magician's Nephew, which is actually the prequel to The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe.  Then you will know whence came the wardrobe.  For some reason, this book isn't as well known as the sequels.\n",
      "A classic Blu-Ray I wanted to add to my collection that my family has enjoyed for many years and we will enjoy it now on Blu-ray.\n",
      "The picture was very funny and very exciting from beginning to end.  I  recommend it to everyone.\n",
      "The perfect representation of the pure childlike wonder in us all. The journey from the city to a different world is nicely told.  Good film to watch !\n",
      "I love this movie!!!  It was once lost but now is found again!!!!  Thank-you so much for making it easy to find!!\n",
      "Have all of them but I think this is my favorite.  Just a wonderful movie for the whole family to watch.\n",
      "My daughter was very surprised when she got this movie. I knew she liked it very much and she was very happy that it got added to her collection! Now she wants to read the book!\n",
      "The chronicals of Narnia is an epic adventure. The battle scenes are big and the special effects are great. Some points of the movie is too slow and some scenes could easily scare young children.\n",
      "ExcellentGood family movie,  good quality film,Hard to find theses days among quick budget films.Entertaining, magical, fantastic and well worth your time .\n",
      "This almost-epic-length film is far superior to the TV version of a few years ago, as we might expect given the rapid development of SFX technology.  It's also an almost exact copy of the classic book, with only a few scenes (not very vital) left out.  By now probably everyone knows the story: the four Pevensy children are sent away from London during the Blitz and end up at a rambling old country house inhabited by aged Prof. Kirke and his housekeeper; youngest Lucy inadvertantly blunders into the magical land of Narnia by way of a magical wardrobe and is befriended by a faun named Tumnus, tries to convince her sister and brothers of the reality of her experience, is followed in a second time by Edmund (who meets the infamous White Witch, self-proclaimed Queen of Narnia, and is tricked into becoming her agent), and a third time by all three of them; they discover that Tumnus has been arrested by the Queen's Secret Police (wolves), are befriended by a pair of talking Beavers, learn that they are the foretold saviors of the land, and after extended trails (and Edmund's temporary defection) finally meet and make common cause with Aslan, the great Lion, who has assembled an army for them to lead against the Witch and her partisans.Of course if you've read the book you know ahead of time how it's all going to turn out, and the real enjoyment comes from seeing how the scriptwriters and director have translated the story to film and how the SFX department has made the magic of Narnia come alive.  I don't think I've seen better effects since the first chapter of \"Star Wars\" burst upon an astounded world 30 years ago.  Even though you know that the creatures of Narnia are computer-generated, they seem so lifelike that you root for the good ones and (mentally) hiss the bad guys: standouts include Aslan (of course), whose facial expressions haven't been equalled by an effects-created creature since \"Dragonheart,\" the centaurs in his army (one of whom serves as Peter Pevensy's second-in-command), and the Witch's force, a wonderfully-imagined stew of ugliness including her General, who appears to be a Minotaur.  There are even cheetahs in the good army and tigers in the evil one whose movements are completely true to what you've seen in nature films.  The climactic battle (which was apparently filmed in New Zealand) is absolutely unforgettable, including a clashing, crashing confrontation between Peter and the Witch, the latter armed with not one but two swords and swinging them around like broomsticks.  (And the music that plays under the action makes you want to rush right out and get the soundtrack CD.)  And, as has been mentioned by another reviewer, just when you think the story has ended and the credits have started to roll, there's a little surprise that isn't in the book but looks forward to revelations of a later volume in the series.  (Recently while at my local theater to see another flick, I noticed a poster for a forthcoming release of \"Prince Caspian,\" the second book in the Chronicles, so it looks as if we can hope to see all seven adapted to film in the next few years.)  Well-paced, splendidly visualized, and just scary enough to give youngsters some delicious thrills (and maybe, admittedly, a nightmare or two), this is DVD that should be in everyone's permanent collection; it's definitely going to join mine.\n",
      "I have just seen this movie yesterday as of this writing (wherein i'm also undergoing with my reading of the Complete Chronicles of NARNIA by C.S. Lewis where this movie is based from - in particular the second part: THE LION THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE), this here epic children's fiction story of C.S. LEWIS' allegorical depiction of the parallels and meaning behind Christ's (represented by Aslan) purpose here on earth and the ongoing battle within humans in God's creation against the forces of Evil...and I find it to be as one of the best movies to come around not only for the year, but from the few previous years - which is not turning out that quite bad at all- considering that with all of the good books' reissues and boxed sets that we are seeing along with the movie-lizations for such as the HARRY POTTER series by J.K. Rowling, and Roald Dahl's and for L.O.T.R. by C.S. Lewis' own comrade J.R.R. Tolkein, it ain't so bad at all to spice up what turns out for the movie industry since the turn of the century.Those of the actors that starred in this movie are a certain cast of unknowns, which works at times for several movies, and I guess perhaps by not cashing on to herald known stars for the movie- it's such way to tell in the intent of the moviemakers at times as to indicate that the producers are not opting for a commercial appeal a bit but more on for the focus about the motion pictures artistic(al) values, or perhaps being that much of the budget are all spent out and used already for the setttings and the effects - they do not have enough money to afford big-named stars; however a new lease for Qui Gon Jinn is featured as the voice of Aslan (the Lion King may i say, with no intended pun for the other Disney animated flick feature) which is thus performed by no other than Liam Neeson.It quite bothered me though about the hankie that the youngest girl in the story Lucy gave to the faun, which the Beaver have given back to the little girl upon the capture of the said faun -and later on the flick we find that the faun hand it back to Lucysaying \"you need this more than I do\" (?)Such are a bit of the puzzling things (or errors) in this epic by C.S. Lewis.The movie btw, contains about an 8 minute segment that's even worthier than Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF CHRIST flick - or perhaps that is something which that said movie is trying to emulate ... albeit uneffectively, if one would watch that flick in a objective perspective that is.Hearken, this time the sound system on the cinema where I've watched this flick is quite alright (the trickles of water on 'em frozen victims of the witch are so firkin' realistic - you could almost feel 'em really dripping), however there are certain portions wherein the prints are crumpled and creased. drat! I also find that there are actually a number of TV-adaptations from the likes of those that're produced by HALLMARKfor C.S. LEWIS' stories from the NARNIA Chronicles.In passing, I find that the White Queen Witch (played by an awesome Tilda Swinton) is one foxxy lady. No wonder Aslan gorged her. If you know what I'm saying ;)GRRAAWWWwwwlll...!!Can't wait for the DVD. Bloody good.RATE: 9 out of 10\n",
      "One of my favorite movie series.  If you like fantasy, you should appreciate this movie.  No issues with the product itself.\n",
      "We bought this for the grandkid visits.  They enjoy watching it and we found mild entertainment in it as well.  Great action, special effects and English accents help to make this a worthwhile view.\n",
      "I loved this film, i was read Narnia as a child and i'm a 20 years old now. But i was back. I was back with old friends and i felt literally like a child again in that world of young fantasy were the real world literally rips away and your left in a place were anything is possible. This is just how i felt watching it. It was filmed so perfectly and acted and scripted just right that i lost myself in it and was no longer aware that i was in a cinema. My younger brother would tap my shoulder and ask me to pass the popcorn and i would turn back to the screen and get sucked back into the world. With no waiting time to get back into it.I didn't expect it to be this good. Or the director to do this well. But i was well wrong. And all the happier for it.Children will be amazed, adults will enjoy it and if you're a reader...WOW.\n",
      "Though the movie doesn't completely follow the book series exactly, this is a good adaptation. The novels will always be better, but this movie compliments the unfolding story of Narnia. The cast selection was great, for the sour expression of Edmond and little Lucy's bright eyed look of wonder were perfect. The young people clearly enjoyed their roles and played them well. Animation has come so far, that the movies made from my childhood favorites add to the mystical quality of some of the greatest classics ever written.Chrissy K. McVay - Author\n",
      "i loved it ....................................................its better on blue ray  i love it  the first one it too get all stared the best one ever .......................................................................\n",
      "This being the first movie, is my favorite one so far.  I think there is supposed to be one more made in the movie series.  I enjoy seeing the development and discovery of Narnia and all of the characters.\n",
      "This expanded version, worked better for me than the theatrical version--itself very good. The few extra minutes in several places made action scenes more coherent, and flow better. The other discs with fottage explaining the making of the movie, and the bio of its author, are a treasure.\n",
      "I'm very well satisfied with the DVD, however it did arrive late. The original order never made it thanks to USPS but imediately upon contacting customer service at Amazon they got a replacement sent out to me. The long and short of it is that I'm satisfied both with the product and with Amazon's customer service and not real happy with USPS.\n",
      "Super movie just like the book, I read all the books as a child then again when I was older.\n",
      "I'm a sucker for director's cut editions of movies.  The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was a good and fun movie in the release version, but really shines in the extended version.  This is the one to own.\n",
      "The first half of the story is focused on character development and may be slow to the action fanastics. But once the Pevensie siblings are united together against the witch, the movie takes a big turn to become a seemingly Lord of the Rings genre. True, there is a grippingly dark scene when the Lion sacrificed itself for Peter. Yet the major battle took place in broad daylight and was crisp, engaging, pulse beating. It maintains a kernel of hope throughout.The computer graphics succeeds in its subtlety, sophisticated and yet so real. It is an eye-opener despite the many hard-to-beat predecessors. The beavers are adorable, the lion's floating hair captivating, the flying eagles animation dazzling.What is also appealing about the movie is its beautiful landscape accompanied by a luring score - winter wonderland, snow sledge chase, green pastures that stretches far beyond, castles on high mountains.Yet what actually makes a difference are the delightfully well-chosen child actors. They display integrity and noble character, not relying on pretty faces. They are not expected to play larger-than-life heroes. Even the evil witch, young and beautiful, has defied being stereotyped and delivered a convincingly evil presence. The swordplay of the witch (two hands) are interestingly pleasing to watch - not an easy feat even for the Chinese.The plot and characters remain intact, never sidelined or dwarfed by the computer animation and special effects. For a change, the story telling and humans count more importance and preserve this classic fantasy tale.  If the Lord of the Rings is likened to a pounding orchestral piece depicting the harshness of Winter and the troughs of danger, then the Chronicles of Narnia is a delightful Beethoven that enlightens with the hope and crescents of Spring.\n",
      "Honestly I don't understand all those giving this ONE star?!  I mean there are 2 or 3 or 4 stars to choose from guys.  No offense but this wasn't a rinky dink B movie or starship troopers which was terrible.  This was a well made and well acted film.Let me start out with the Kids as some expressed they weren't up to par.  Well guess what?  They are KIDS.  *Chuckles*  They aren't seasoned actors like Rachael Weisz or Tom Hanks or Brenden Frasier, Val Kilmer or Susan Sarandon etcetc.  These kids hadn't ever been in a movie like this prior.  2: That said, the kids I thought did a wonderful job.  You were quickly brought into their world of wonder and adventure.  The youngest girl I thought was actually the best of them all but they all did great jobs.And to put a stamp on that fact, my Nieces who are near Highschool age now or a year off,  cried.  Now niether wanted to even SEE the movie because they are avid Harry Potter fans.  They were sure they would hate it.  I had to drag them to see it.  In the end not only did they cry but the eldest said the movie was excellent.But anyway, the special effects were actually very good.  As there had to be a lot of digital characters I was worried about the realism of the animals and what not but the fact is, Asland *The Lion* was incredibly well done as were the wolves beavers etcetc.Now if you are not into childrens stories, then obviously you shouldn't see this, even though I think it's a great movie.  Some knocked it for being childish which is just retarded because it is a CHILDRENS book series.  Age range the books were aimed at was like 4 to 14 I'd say.  But any adult who grew up with the books and LIKED the books will enjoy this movie.Oh and for the fellow  saying it reminded him of a young version Lord of the Rings well guess what, the Author of the Chronicles and the Author of LoTR were like good friends.  Thus the similarities.So to sum up, good movie, very good action, Special effects excellent.  New Zealand Scenery absolutely beautiful.  Child actors did a wonderful job.If you want to enjoy being a kid for a day, I HIGHLY recommend this movie.\n",
      "I've seen it before so it's not surprising when Narnia did this to me too: it gets poor reviews and it's very polarizing until I watched it and actually liked it. I remember reading the books in one setting and I actually forgot the story to practically all of them. Call it being rushed or just forgetfulness but re-experiencing the story of this one made me like the book even more since it's quite a story anyway you slice it.The Pevensie children are relocated during WW2 and they're sent to live with someone. While playing a game of hide and seek, Lucy the youngest stumbles upon a wardrobe closet. Instead of finding the back of it, she finds Narnia, a magical land with talking animals. Afterwards, she brings in her other siblings, Peter, Susan and Edmund and actually get caught up in a war: Narnians versus those loyal to the evil White Witch. And helping them out is the almighty lion Aslan.It's hard to describe Narnia(or Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter for that matter) without saying stuff like almighty, magical and whatnot but the nice thing about the film is that it doesn't over explain too much. One problem I had with Tolkien books was he explained EVERYTHING, even minor characters got backstories, even swords. Do we care how a magical land exists in a wardrobe closet? I don't so it's great that you just go along with it. There is one big of explaining on a resurrection but that's ok, didn't phase me much.Earlier this year King Kong won for Best Visual Effects which honestly I don't understand, there were composition problems all over the place like they were nearly finished but put in the finished film. Narnia has the same problem but not as extreme. Some shots are actually very well done while other shots are very funky looking(usually involving talking animals). Weta in many respects as a long way to go before they achieve quality shots. ILM has gone past the realm of \"obvious CG shots\" and Weta is catching up. The better of the 2 in the long run, I got no idea.Acting-wise some have issues with it but I found it pretty solid, especially Georgie Henley as the young Lucy. The other 3 are good but they're not really scene stealers or standouts. Tilda Swilton is of course a perfect White Witch, being over-the-top villainy and relishing in it. And just like Star Wars and Batman Begins and Kingdom of Heaven, Liam Neeson plays Aslan, the all-knowing calm teacheresque lion. Wonder if he'll ever NOT do any father figure roles in the future?It's obvious we're going to get another, and possibly the other 5(apparently Prince Caspian is next) and so far it's a pretty solid entry to the series.\n",
      "This is a completely delightful story and a wonderful adaptation. The scenery and effects are excellent. The characters come to life and are well-portrayed by each of the actors, drawing the viewer completely into the story. A must-see for people of all ages!\n",
      "This movie gave me chills. Few movies these days make you feel like a kid again...but this one certainly did that for me. Having never read the books before (I know...shame on me) this movie was a brand new story to me. The music, the cinematography, and the digital animals are amazing. The actors are wonderful. I sincerely hope that disney makes sequels to this absolutely stunning film. When a movie makes you want to read the book...you know its gotta be good. Watch it, and watch it again, its a gem.\n",
      "Finally saw 'Chronicles of Narnia' a week ago, and I'm glad to say that I was extremely impressed by it. The opening sequence which depicts one of countless air raids on England by the Nazis takes the audience into the heart of the war and effectively shows us in a brief but poignant manner how horrible war is, on several levels. For one the home of the four kids, two brothers and two sisters, and their parents is destroyed, all their memories trashed in a pile of dust and concrete. Most frighteningly, they almost lost their lives, particularly Edmund who dodges into their house while bombs are falling all around just to get a treasured picture he has of his dad, who is depicted as some type of war hero, and maybe not a hero in the traditional sense, but he's a hero to his kids nonetheless. His older brother, Peter, dashes madly in to rescue Daniel from this foolish quest, but as fortune would have it they escape by the skin of their teeth along with their sisters and mother. From this point on, the film flashes forward to a sad moment at an old English train station in which the mother is painfully saying goodbye to her little ones, in hope of whisking them away to safety in the country side, far away from the dangers that are all too close to home.Once on the train, the two sisters finally merge a little more into the picture and develop some of their traits right off the bat. Lucy is precocious and whimsical, while her older sister Susan is perhaps the most mature of the bunch, acting as the substitute mother of her siblings in place of their mom. Naturally the children are depressed because of what has happened and the current events, and on top of that being away from their mother at such a difficult time makes it that much harder for them. Once they arrive at their remote destination far out in the English country side, they trek towards their new home. On the way they are greeted by Mrs. MacReady in a somewhat cold fashion, introducing herself as the housekeeper for the professor's country estate in which they will be living in. As they finally reach the rather large mansion, the children are quickly told what they can and cannot do, as Mrs. MacReady is quite strict about what is tolerated in the professor's house. She also points out that the children must not disturb the professor, and be very quiet because she is set in her ways and doesn't like to be bothered by too much racket. Understandably the children are not too amused by this news, but at the same time they are kind of pleased to be away from danger, so they hesitantly accept the rules of their new home. Of course, children being children, their accord with the head mistress does not last very long as they quickly get into mischief with a game of hide and seek. As Peter counts to a hundred, Lucy, Edmund and Susan run around madly trying to find a good hiding spot. They all find a decent spot, including Lucy who happens to venture into a big, empty room with only one large, imposing wardrobe in the back center. Cautiously Lucy advances forward, carefully opening the wardrobe's door and then enters with her imagination running on all pistons. At first the wardrobe appears to be completely ordinary, but the further she ventures into it she quicly realizes that it's no ordinary wardrobe and that is where the film's fantastical journey finally begins.Walking through the wardrobe, Lucy falls through on the other side, ending up in a snow covered forest, with an old street lantern lighting up her path. A few minutes after getting over her initial shock and amusement, she meets an odd creature that appears to be half man, half deer. At first the intriguing creature is as afraid of Lucy as she is of it, but being her brave self, Lucy introduces herself to what she learns is a faun, and his name is Mr. Mumnus. After a brief conversation and a great deal of puzzlement on the part of Mr. Mumnus, more so than of Lucy's, he invites her into his small lodge that is hidden deep in the woods. They chat quite a bit and learn about each other, Lucy being the most inquisitive of the two and through their lengthy conversation, she befriends Mr. Mumnus. As they share a warm cup of tea in front of the fire, Mr. Mumnus lulls Lucy to sleep with a charmed tune from his flute. As she wakes up, she finds Mr. Mumnus crying, at which point she finds out that he put her to sleep because he has orders to kidnap her for the White Witch. She convinces him to not go through with the misdeed by winning over his heart through her friendship with him, and so he helps her back to her real world.Lucy hurries back through the woods and into the wardrobe, rushing to find her siblings. Much to her surprise, her brothers and sister are still playing hide and seek, and she is none the wiser. Peter finds her quickly since she is no longer hidden, as well as his sister Susan. Doing her best to explain what happened during the past several minutes, Lucy fails to convince her siblings of what had happened over the course of what was several hours for her. Edmund mocks her, while Susan and Peter simply dismiss her outrageous claim as the daydreams of a young child. This unfortunate turn of events upsets Lucy a great deal, but in the not too distant future she gets the last laugh as they are all four sent off to a magical, life changing and unfortgettable journey in what they eventually learn is the land of Narnia.Shortly thereafter, Edmund finds his way through the old wardrobe and into the wondrous land of Narnia. Haphazardly as he walks through the winter forest, he has a chance encounter with a lady known as the White Witch. She warms him up with a blanket and lures him into doing her bidding with the promises of candy that she can make with just a drop of a magical potion. Edmund promises to bring his three siblings to the witch so she can meet them, and unknowingly he betrays Mr. Tumnus as he failed to kidnap Lucy earlier. She lets him go, and he goes back through to the real world. Lucy finds out that Edmund crossed over, but he refuses to acknowledge its existence to Peter and Susan, further enfuriating Lucy.After a short while, the kids are playing cricket in the back yard and Edmund accidentally knocks the ball through a window in the professor's house. Fearing the outcome of this misfortune, they all scramble to hide from both the professor and Mrs. MacReady, and after running frantically from room to room, they finally end up in the old, dusty, large room with the huge wardrobe. Lucy convinces them all to enter, and off they escape to a world where only their imagination is the limit. Once in Narnia, they befriend a couple of beavers who takes them under their wings, or tails in this case, and tells them about the wonders as well as dangers of Narnia. One thing leads to another and before they know it, Edmund is kidnapped by the White Witch while the others are on the run from the White Witch and her evil forces, but fortunately they have some kind creatures of the forest that help them out of their predicament.After a long and challenging journey on the run from the wicked servants, Peter, Lucy and Susan meet with the legendary Aslan, the ruler of the good forces in Narnia. At this point, a greater truth is revealed to them. Daniel, Edmund, Lucy and Susan, as it turns out, were prophesized to be the rulers of the monarchy which exists in Narnia. They were destined to destroy the evil forces of the White Witch and restore order and balance to the kingdom, and that is why the White Witch has kidnapped Edmund and attempted to do the same with his siblings.From here on, epic battles are fought, there is much life lost but also gained, and friendships are forged that transcend time and space. The soundtrack is spectacular, with the songs setting the right kind of mood for a particular scene, while the musical scores engages the audience with the various battles and tense, exciting moments. Never before have I seen such awe inspiring special effects that without a doubt break the mold and set a new standard for which all others to measure up against. Aslan is especially magnificent and as close to a real lion as one could imagine. I cannot forget the cinematography which was breathtaking and really helped capture the imagination of C.S. Lewis' fantastical world filled with all sorts of creatures of both evil and good convictions. The acting was superb, especially the talent displayed by the actress who portrayed Lucy, who practically stole the show at so many moments throughout the film. During the final act of the film, I could not help but be genuinely moved to tears by the acts of courage and defiance of the army of Aslan and the four children. When Oreius the centaur wielding two swords charged through battle with no regard for his own life to save Peter from imminent death at the hands of the White Witch, he created one of the most memorable and admirable moments in movie history. Words cannot describe that kind of bravery and love, and one cannot help but have tremendous respect for such an act.The way in which the siblings helped each other out through matters of life and death, it was nothing short of deeply touching. They overcame their petty differences from the real world and realized what truly mattered to them, which was each other.This movie exceeded my expectations and went above and beyond in all aspects. From the heroes to the villains and everything and everyone in between, it was expertly crafted by the director and screen writers who managed to successfully bring to life one of the world's most treasured fantasies. It is without a doubt one of the best movies of 2005, and I'm glad to say that it is a new addition to my list of all time favorite films.\n",
      "If you like Sci Fi then you should see this for sure.  It's very good - but not so good to make you want to see it a hundred times like Avatar was.  I'm just a big Avatar/Star Wars devotee and so i can't help but compare every sci fi or fantasy movie with those.  I just think that if you know anything about those movies then it will help you to know what to expect if I use those for comparison.  This movie is good for a younger audience but that doesn't mean it's childish - it's good and worth seeing for sure if you like this type of movie (sci fi/Adventure.  SEE it.\n",
      "This is one of the best movies ever.Its good for kids.Its good for christians.Its good for parents.I am waiting for the next installment.I am not giving a synopsis except to say it is written by C.S. Lewis; J.R.R. Tolkiens close friend.And it exemplifies what it is like to live a life of a christian metaphorically.Our temptations, addictions, sins.Our stuggle over evil.Our faith and ultimate victory.And our crowning rewards.I did not, however, like the extras on this 4 disc set.Disney could've done a MUCH better job w/ that.I dont even think Disney did them.I didnt even bother to watch the 4th disc.But this set has the bookends and that alone is worth it.\n",
      "This movie has something for everyone; great acting, adventure, suspense, great morals, battles with only a hint of bloodshed (mostly left to the imagination), and some of the greatest music put to a movie in many years. What more could you want? Well how about some bloopers and commentary by the director and the main characters? I would say two things; the movie does NOT follow the book, but if you go into it with that in mind (try not to be resentful or you'll spoil a perfectly great movie), you'll find it is a masterpiece in it's own right, well done on all counts. Also, some of the creatures are a bit scary for the very young, and a bit violent too, but no sad endings here. It's definitely a must-have to treasure for many years. I bought the CD too, because the music is so beautiful.\n",
      "It is by far my kids favorite movie right now. They know all of the characters and I think they feel like they are actually within the movie. I love that its biblically based.\n",
      "In truth, I've never been a big fan of such fantasies, although I knew the general plot outline for the Narnia series. I've seen all three LOTR films, including the 1970s cartoon version (which was superior to the live action version), read only The Hobbit in high school, have not read any of the Harry Potter books, but thought the first three films in that series were superior to the vastly overrated LOTR trilogy in almost every way. As for Oz, I've, of course, seen the 1939 Judy Garland film classic, but only read the first two books of the several dozen in the L. Frank Baum series. I do, recall, however, an early 1970s cartoon film of one of the later Oz books that had Liza Minelli voice Dorothy. Yet, none of these film versions, at least, equal the current film version of the first of the Narnia books: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. In fact, if the book is anywhere near as good as the film then even Lewis Carroll's mighty Alice books and Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio might have to move over as the reigning titans of children's fantasy literature. Yes, I know many J.R.R. Tolkien fans will object to the LOTR series being classified a children's fantasy, but too bad. Narnia is superior in virtually every way to LOTR, and Lewis wore the children's tag with pride.... This is the result of a good screenplay, which is very hard to do for kids, for most children's films lack that child-like wonder, as if the filmmakers have forgotten what childhood was like. Cinematographer Donald McAlpine captures that point of view in many of the child's eye shots of vistas and the whimsy on the children's faces. The only downside to the film is that, like many fantasies, you have to suspend logic. For example, why does Aslan need to wait a hundred years to bring an end to the White Witch's eternal winter? He clearly has the power to do so at any time, but `The Prophecy' has foretold that it can only occur when the four children arrive. But, this is part of the suspension of disbelief that all such tales require. The score works well, and never intrudes on the film, as it too often does in the LOTR trilogy, and the film's credits end with a terrific song by Alanis Morissette.I hope that this film does well enough that the remaining six books hit the screen, for with the amount of dreck being foisted at kids, these films will prove a nice respite. If only the Alice and Oz books are next on the film franchise conveyor belt, rather than Shrek 13 or Ice Age: Revenge Of The Neandertals. Click the heels of your ruby slippers along with me. Please.\n",
      "\"Once a king or queen in Narnia, always a king or queen. Bear it well, Sons of Adam! Bear it well, Daughters of Eve!\" - Aslan in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the WardrobeWhen it was announced that Disney had bought the rights to C.S. Lewis' Narnia series, I have to admit that I was worried. Walt Disney Studios haven't always been known to produce faithful adaptations of books (example:The Black Cauldron). But in late 2005, all of my worries were laid to rest. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was one of the most memorable films that I saw that year.The story is deceptively simple and straightforward. During the bombing of London in WWII, the four Pevensie children are sent to the idyllic countryside to stay with the mysterious Prof. Kirke. While exploring the house Lucy, the youngest, finds herself wandering into a large ornate wardrobe. To her astonishment it leads into a wintry forest where she meets a faun (a mythological figure; half-goat, half-human) named Mr. Tumnus. He invites her to his home where he lulls her to sleep with his flute. When she awakens he confesses that he had been given orders to kidnap any human children he might find and hand them over to the malevolent Queen Jadis, the White Witch. The White Witch, it is revealed, has cast a spell over all Narnia so that it is always winter, always winter but never Christmas. Mr. Tumnus helps Lucy to find her way back to the wardrobe. Lucy tells her brothers, Peter and Edmund and her sister, Susan about her amazing discovery of a land within the wardrobe. Naturally they don't believe her and what's worse they fear that she might've gone mad. But then one night Lucy goes back through the wardrobe into Narnia, unaware that Edmund has followed her. While she is visiting Mr. Tumnus, Edmund encounters the White Witch herself. The White Witch serves him enchanted food and promises to make him a prince if he can arrange a meeting between her and his other siblings. When Edmund and Lucy return, Edmund lies to Peter and Susan about where they've been. But soon all four children find themselves in Narnia. When they go to visit Mr. Tumnus they come upon his home in shambles. The White Witch has discovered his betrayal and punished him for \"fraternizing with humans\". The children are almost too frightened to go on when they meet a talking beaver named, get this... Mr. Beaver. Mr. Beaver guides them to his luxurious dam where he introduces them to his wife, Mrs. Beaver. The children are repeatedly told that, \"Aslan is on the move\". After a lengthy scene in which the beavers give a lot of story exposition about a Narnian prophecy, Peter, Susan and Lucy realize that Edmund's gone missing. He's betrayed them and gone to the castle of the White Witch. The three children and the two beavers must make their way to the Stone Table where Aslan, the Lion King of Narnia, will protect them. On their trek they face many dangers and see many wondrous things that I won't go into detail about. Needless to say the four children are reunited and prove themselves to be heroes in a climactic battle with the White Witch's forces.C.S. Lewis wroteThe Chronicles of Narniaas a Christian allegory but the books are often viewed simply as being children's fantasy, which indeed they are, but also much more. The story features talking beats, epic battles, noble sacrifice and a contagious sense of wonderment. The first film journey into Narnia is not only faithful to the book but also expands the story and characters. It may not be on the same level asThe Lord of the Ringsbut the Narnia films will still be remembered as a classic series.There are four available versions of this film on DVD, they are:Single disc edition, which includes two audio commentaries, an informative trivia track, a blooper reel and previews2-disc Collector's Edition, which includes all the features from the single disc version but also comes with a second disc loaded to the brim with cool bonuses4-disc Extended Edition, which includes all the features available in the two earlier editions plus a third disc with a biography of C.S. Lewis, and another disc of special features4-disc Extended Edition + Bookend Gift Set, which contains the 4-disc Extended Edition as well as two collectible bookends of Lucy with the wardobe and Tumnus and with the lamppostOf these four versions I would recommend the 2-disc Collector's Edition and the 4-disc Extended Edition. While the Gift Set is very nice it isn't really worth the price unless you're a diehard Narnia collector.\n",
      "It has literally been decades since I've even looked at the cover of the \"Chronicles of Narnia\" series, so my review will not be based on how it relates/compares to the novels by C.S. Lewis.Over all this is a wonderful and masterful film.  The costume design and special effects may be the best I've ever seen in a movie (the special effects aren't James Bond type explosions either - i.e. Aslan looks like a real lion through out the entire movie, yet no lions were used during any of the filming).  Until \"The Lord of the Ring\" trilogy (where after the first two films you knew you had not seen the conclusion), \"Narnia\" had a beginning, a middle, and an end (which made it much better then \"LOTR\" - IMHO).There are a total of 7 books in the original \"Narnia\" series and the producers own the film rights to all seven - though I don't know if they will make that many.  Currently \"Prince Caspian\" is in production and I feel confident that they will do at least one more after that, but if there will be more then 3 movies I do not know.For those interested in the Christian symbolism, it is in the film.  From the obvious (the kids being called, \"Daughters or Eve or Sons of Adam\") to the more in-depth, such as the fact that there are 4 kids/main characters or Aslan himself.So people may not feel that this is a 5-star movie, but I believe once the others are released and the story comes out more that it will only grow and expand the excellence that is this series.I definately recommend this movie for everyone, not just for kids or families.\n",
      "The effects are spectacular and you feel like you are in this alternate world with the characters.  It's really a fun family movie (with some scary moments) that has some nice underlying growth messages.  I'm happy that I watched this movie.\n",
      "\"The Chronicles of Narnia\" is one of those rare sets of stories that are meaningful to children, teens, and adults.  However, what is especially interesting about these stories is that they mean very different things to people at different ages while retaining their ability to convey it central message to everyone.  There is a reason this set of stories has grown in popularity and reputation over the past fifty-plus years.  C. S. Lewis created his stories drawing on his rich understanding of myth, his Christian faith, and his brilliance as a writer.Kids will love the fantasy and adventure.  There will be moments of great wonder and even some of fear, but all of this great movie will delight them.  Teens will relate to the four main characters and their complete loss of control over their lives during the terrible Blitz of World War II and then having to rise to the challenges that face them in the very strange world of Narnia.  Adults will enjoy all the adventure and fantasy, but also the way ancient myths and characters are used to dress out what is basically a Christological message.Then there is the achievement of the film itself.  The visual aspects of the film are simply marvelous to behold.  It is something you will want to see many times (at least I do).  The achievement of Aslan as a character who exists only in a computer or briefly as three different models, well, that is a tour de force of the animator's art.  Having to get such a beloved and well known story into a film that can be shown at commercial length and still delight fans of the books is also an accomplishment to be proud of.The characters on the screen and the voices chosen for the animations are all spot on.  I enjoyed every performance in the film and am delighted to own this DVD to watch with my family many times.The extras on this deluxe 2 DVD edition are unbelievably rich.  You get a voice over with the director and the four children of the cast, another voice over with the director and a few of the other creative talents who helped make the movie, and another feature with pop up informational bits.  So, you can watch the movie four times and without watching it the same way twice.  Then there is also a montage of bloopers that is a bit of fun.  This is all just on the first disk.The second disk is crammed full of features that will show you what seems to be every aspect of making the film.  We get features of the director, all the principle creative talents including the producer.  Then there are features about the story C.S. Lewis created and how all the other artists had to tell that story through their individual crafts.  So much of the original story has to be interpreted to get it on the screen.  The areas where images, sounds, and effects would have been supplied by the reader's imagination have to be made explicit in a movie, and what we have been given here is amazing.There is another feature on the creating of the creatures and one on a single amazing scene and how it was put together from filming done in a half-dozen countries.  There is even a map of Narnia that the viewer can explore in 3-D computer generation.Even the case of this deluxe edition is interesting and evokes the main idea of the magical wardrobe.  It also includes a couple of postcard-sized reproductions of the concept art for the movie.I recommend this for everyone and especially families to watch and talk about together.  There is a lot in these stories and a lot to draw out of each other about what the meaning each took from the various scenes and images.\n",
      "There are a few extra scenes in the main movie that are fun to see.  But the main reasons to buy this set are the extra disks.  If you have any interest in seeing how this movie was made or learning more aabout CS Lewis, get this version.\n",
      "We won't get into the whole \"movie v book\" debate (This is C.S. Lewis we're talking about, after all), but this film is definitely to be seen!  GREAT film. Very touching.\n",
      "I read the books repeatedly when I was in elementary and junior high school...that was 20+ years ago...watching this movie brought back every memory of the story. I felt it was very true to the story, and really well-done. I even cried during the trailer, it was so powerful! Wow.\n",
      "This film was very eagerly awaited by many fans of the books, and fantasy fans in general. By and large, the film delivers the goods, although it teeters a bit here and there. Narnia, the magical land entered through the wardrobe, is stunningly rendered. The wonder of Narnia in winter as first glimpsed by Lucy is perfect. The White WItch is perfectly dreadful, as she was meant to be. The children, for the most part, are good as well, though a few wooden moments occur during the rather long running time. Happily, the creature effects are well-done, especially the lion, Aslan. He was the epitome of nobility and power. The battle scenes seemed just a bit sanitized, perhaps after seeing the epic battles of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, we need to be completely bowled over to be impressed anymore. Anyway, the religious element wasn't bashed over our heads, just presented as it was in the book, more symbolic than overt, which is as it was supposed to be. There were a few deviations from the book, which again is usual for a transfer to the big screen. Hollywood seems to think a book just isn't allright as it is, and must be \"doctored\" a bit for translation to film. Oh well. For the most part, the film is very happily very close to the book, and it succeeds as a film. Hopefully this means the others in the series will be as good themselves. The DVD transfer is beautiful, with excellent light and dark contrast, with bright glowing colors. The sound is great without being overbearing. I had very definite ideas in my head when I read the book as to the landscape, the characters, and especially Aslan. Thankfully, the powers that be who created this film had many of the same ideas.\n",
      "Carefully marketed to be the next franchisable fantasy film alongside The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Harry Potter series, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe defeated Peter Jackson's over-hyped juggernaut, King Kong  at the box office in a surprise upset. The combination of a Christmas holiday release date, strong source material (C.S. Lewis' classic novel) and a family friendly take proved to be unbeatable. A sequel, not surprisingly, is in the works.The four children are all excellent and quite believable as siblings. Henley, in particular, does a good job as the adorable and precocious Lucy. Her wonderfully expressive eyes convey her emotions and play quite effectively on our sympathies. The filmmakers wisely cast unknown actors in these parts which helps transform them into their characters because we have no pre-conceived notions about them.The Chronicles of Narnia is a triumph of production design, visual effects and on pretty much every other level of technical expertise as it successfully immerses us in this magical world rich in detail and atmosphere - something that is par for the course for these kinds of films ever since The Lord of the Rings raised the bar so high. The film is also quite faithful to Lewis' novel and manages to capture the sense of wonder while maintaining the right balance of warmth, humanity and darkness. Although, children who are sensitive to seeing animals being hurt (even though faked) might not want to see this film.This film places an emphasis on the bond of family. Only when the four children are reunited and work together as a team are they victorious. Despite Edmund's transgressions, he is forgiven, welcomed back into the fold and given the chance to redeem himself - hence its universal appeal. The fact that the filmmakers did not screw up adapting a book beloved and cherished by so many is an achievement in and of itself. The Chronicles of Narnia is an entertaining and well-made fantasy epic.The two-disc special edition is jam-packed with extras that cover many aspects of the filmmaking process. But we kick things off on the first disc with \"The Bloopers of Narnia,\" an amusing collection of pratfalls, blown lines and general goofing around on the set.One also has the option to \"Discover Narnia Fun Fact\" that involves various factoids about the film to popping up on the screen as you are watching it. The only complaint of this feature is the infrequency of them. For such a book steeped in trivia (as I'm sure the film is as well) there could have been more facts appearing on screen.Also included is an audio commentary by director Andrew Adamson and actors William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley. Not surprisingly, the older kids, in particular Moseley and Popplewell, offer the most coherent comments while Adamson gamely prods them with decent questions.There is a second commentary by Adamson, production designer Roger Ford and producer Mark Johnson. This is a more technically oriented track as they talk about how WW2-era London was recreated and how Narnia was brought to life.The second disc starts off with \"Chronicles of a Director\" that takes a look at the man who directed Shrek and was subsequently put in charge of this huge epic.\"The Children's Magical Journey\" focuses on the four child actors. Adamson was looking for real kids and not self-conscious child actors. They clearly had the time of their lives as evident by their tireless enthusiasm.\"Evolution of an Epic\" is broken down into four featurettes. One profiles C.S. Lewis and examines the inspiration behind his Narnia books and takes a look at their enduring legacy. Various technical aspects, from the weapons and armour to the creature make-up and the costumes are examined. We see how they all contributed to bringing the novel to life. Also, a specific scene - the melting frozen river sequence - is dissected into its various technical aspects: CGI, miniatures and soundstages. The amount of work and the scale on which this film was made is very impressively conveyed in these extras. They provide a snapshot of just how much hard work was put into making Narnia.\"Creatures of the World\" takes a look at the various types of creatures that inhabit the world of Narnia, from centaurs to satyrs to characters like Aslan and Tumnus. The focus is on the more technical aspects but when you click on the wardrobe icon you get the historical and literary perspective, their traits and physical attributes.\"Explore Narnia\" presents an interactive map of the fantasy world. It puts key locations into their context within the story and its distinctive characteristics. This is an excellent guide.Finally, there is \"Legends in Time\" that presents a timeline of events that occur in Narnia and how they compare to time in the real world.\n",
      "I know this movie by heart. I have watched it innumerable times: I know every scene, every second of it, every expression of each character, every look on their faces.I've read the books after watching the movie, I didn't like the books too much because they seemed too childish to me(I didn't read the books as a child).I think the movie really captures the soul and the atmosphere of Narnia. Andrew Adamson(the director) created the world of Narnia, the real Narnia, so that everyone can believe that Narnia really exists. All the actors are chosen just right: I see Lucy, Susan, Edmund and Peter in Georgie Henley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes and William Moseley. Tilda Swinton, James McAvoy: there couldn't be better choice for the characters of the White Witch and Mr. Tumnus. The best voice actors were chosen as well for Mr.and Mrs. Beaver, Aslan, Fox, all the creatures.The music is incredible. It seems Harry Gregson-Williams has actually been in Narnia.After watching this movie the first time I was looking in all wardrobes and closets in the house trying to find a way to Narnia. And I believe that one day I will actually get there. The Narnia created by Andrew Adamson.I wish he would create another part of the Chronicles, \"The horse and his boy\". We could see Pevensie children already grown in Narnia as kings and queens, we could see what Narnia looked like then.\n",
      "good old fashioned fairy tale--loved it and the special effects.A movie for all ages...\n",
      "Great family picture!  Not for kids under 7 or 8 though for battle scenes.  Characters are well developed and a great adventure into another world.\n",
      "This also arrived in a timely manner, along with the other two DVD's. Now the kids have something to watch as they grow up.\n",
      "I love this movie and they stayed true to the book. I would recommend this for all ages. Great family movie with Christian values.\n",
      "This movie is an excellent adaptation of C.S. Lewis's novel.  Yes, there are slight changes, but nothing that takes away from the awesome story of original work.The cast is perfect!  I have heard others complain that more famous actors should have been cast for this film.  I say nonsense.  Having not-so-famous people in the film made it an even better production.And these not-so-famous actors and actresses did the book proud!  There is not even one-second of this movie where anyone underacted overacted their parts.Georgie Henley is stupendous as Lucy Pevensie, bringing just the right mix of timidity and exuberance.  She deserves praise, and I am sure C.S. Lewis would have loved her performance.  I know I did, and I am a big fan of The Chronicles of Narnia!Skandar Keynes is remarkable as Edmund Pevensie, tackling one of the most difficult characters in the movie.  He has to play the reluctant villian in a fantasy movie that requires so much imagination.  He performed like a veteran!  I look forward to seeing this kid in more films.  He's got talent and understanding well beyond his years.William Moseley is fantastic in his role as Peter Pevensie.  The casting for this movie was virtually flawless, and Moseley's performance is proof of that.  Acting with so much of the surrounding environment and characters being computer generated can not be easy, yet Moseley seems a natural at it!  Bravo!Anna Popplewell plays Susan Pevensie, the sibling who tries to bind the rest together - almost playing mom to the rest.  She is absolutely beautiful!  Liv Tyler, but with the ability to act!  If she stays in film, she could be one of the biggest stars of all time!  Just has to do more big American films!Tilda Swinton is perfect in her role as the White Witch.  She manages to be beautiful and not-so-beautiful at the same time, which if you've read the books, is exaclty what was needed to make this film work.  I have to assume she was very familiar with The Chronicles of Narnia to make play her role to such perfection.  Once again, bravo!I shall mention only one more character in the movie.  One that really grabbed my attention right from his first scene in the movie.  James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus, the Faun, is amazing.  He is exaclty as creepy, yet nice, as I expected the character to be.  I have watched the DVD (also saw the film twice in theaters) about five times now, and I really love his acting and the parts of the film where he is talking to Lucy.This movie has a little bit of everything: great one-liners, great scenery, great special effects and computer generated images.  And its message of sacrifice and love is so universally accepted, it is a film for everyone!Andrew Adamson worked hard to create a movie that C.S. Lewis fans can be so proud of!  I appreciate and applaud him for doing so!Thanks A.A.See ya next review!\n",
      "I gotta say, there have definitely been a lack of decent movies lately. It seems to be all immature teenage comedies, lousy remakes of old classics, or stupid horror films. For me, Narnia was an amazingly fresh and enjoyable movie. You probably know the plot by now, and the film stays pretty true to the book. However, the kids wanting to go back home and Aslan's attitude toward the Witch ticked me off. The cinematography, acting, costumes, and effects all come together to portray a true world. That's the highest praise I can give a film. Can't wait for the next one, and I hope Hollywood acutally starts making some more good movies someday soon. Cheers.\n",
      "I'm quite upset with [...] whose editor on their film site lead me to believe that this film would disappoint. That is not the case as long as you know what to expect. One expectation that was set by the pre-release review I read was that the special effects would not be spectacular. They're not. In fact, the CGI is so far from realistic it may have been better to do this as a computer animated feature. Nevertheless, don't let the mediocre CGI steer you away from this otherwise phenomenal film.I always had a hard time watching the original BBC versions as the special effects and puppets were absolutely abysmal, but it was still incredibly true to the book. My biggest fear with this one was that would resolve the special effects issues, but would stray from the novel so much that it would become unwatchable. My biggest fear was that they would modify the content to loose it's religious allegory in order to \"avoid offending people\". Thankfully the director was ever true to the novel, committing a few minor sins of omission, but leaving the main story, and it's metaphors in tact, and for that I am grateful. The story follows CS Lewis's novel nearly perfectly, loosing only minor details, and minor bits of dialogue, and not adding anything that would disrupt the flow of the original tale.I'm really proud of Disney for having the guts to do this film right, and having the guts to keep CS Lewis's original vision intact. Thank you.Although the CGI effects were disappointing after some of the newer fantasy films such as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, CS Lewis's classic has finally been given the definitive visual version of the tale that it has long deserved... and I can finally retire the abysmal BBC version.The acting in here is fantastic, the cinematography is artistically brilliant, and best of all Aslan is awesome. If you can only see one movie this winter, see this one. You aren't likely to regret it, as long as you don't have too high of expectations for the CGI.\n",
      "If you're going to bring a beloved classic to life, you had better do it right - and director Andrew Adamson did just that, largely because of his own special memories of reading the book as a child.  The timing for this film was also right - not only because it follows in the wake of the masterful Lord of the Rings series (and there will always be comparisons between Narnia and LOTR, despite their vast differences) but, more importantly, because this film really could not have been made any earlier.  I wasn't a big fan of CGI when the technology emerged; I thought it took away from the purity of the medium and, of course, it was oftentimes obviously not real in those early days.  When you watch The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, though, you see the undeniable magic that CGI has now opened up.  This film is heavy with computer animation, and its integration with real actors and sets is virtually seamless.  Aslan, by way of example, may well be CGI's highest achievement to date.  For one thing, he looks bloody real in every scene, but what is truly amazing is the depth of feeling and emotion that comes through in his face and gestures, particularly during the scene at the Stone Slab.There's really far more to praise about this film than I have time or room for.  I'll just say the cinematography and music are masterful, and the creation of the different creatures (be they computer-generated or wonders of costuming) are incredibly detailed and realistic.  I just want to hurry up and talk about the children playing the Pevensie siblings.  Do they give awards for best casting?  If they don't, they certainly should, and this film would take that prize hands-down.  They boys (William Moseley as Peter and Skandar Keynes as Edmund) are excellent, but the girls are nothing short of perfect.  There's just something about Anna Popplewell (Susan) that I find blissfully charming.  Her character is basically the smart and careful one of the bunch, and Popplewell just radiates nobility and a maturity beyond her years.  Young Georgie Henley, though, takes the proverbial cake as little Lucy.  I tend to think of this story as Lucy's for the most part.  It is she who first takes us into Narnia, and we see that enchanted land primarily through her eyes.  Aslan is the central character, but Lucy is really the audience's link to everything that happens.  I think you can experience Narnia just by watching Lucy - the childish wonder, the joy of the land's magic, and the heart-breaking sadness of the White Witch's most evil deeds.  If you listen to the children's commentary on the DVD, though, you'll be even more impressed with these kids.  Georgie is the quintessential child, a fountain of unbridled energy and unabashed honesty, but she also asks the director some incredibly insightful questions about some of his directorial decisions.  All of these kids are smart as a whip, but that Georgie truly is something special.I'm assuming you already know the story here, so I won't go into plot details.  What makes the story resonate so deeply is the myriad of interpretations you can take away from it.  Clearly, there's a strong Christian allegory at work here, primarily in terms of Aslan, the rightful king of Narnia, but you don't have to view the story in that way at all - although the moral implications of this classic contest between good and evil are obvious and beneficial to all.  Your interpretation, in fact, may very well change with each viewing.  Children can just enjoy it as an adventure with talking animals, but as they come back to the film over time they will begin to pick up on the deeper meanings of the story.  This is one of those rare films that gets better and better with each viewing.You have to love the bonus features on the two-disc collector's edition.  We're talking hours and hours of behind-the-scenes footage and insights into the whole Narnia experience (and a few bloopers).  I really love the Kids and Director Commentary, and I would heartily encourage you to watch that.  Filmmaker commentary (and there's one of those here, as well) tend to be rather boring.  I got more out of the Kids Commentary than I would normally get out of ten filmmaker commentaries.  You also have the option of watching the film with interesting facts about Narnia popping up from time to time.  If you really want to know how in the world this incredible movie was brought to life, you'll relish Disc 2 and its hours of interviews and film prep featurettes on the casting, design, costuming, creature-making, etc.  You can also find really nice information on the different creatures you'll meet in Narnia - and you can even explore Narnia's most important locations and hear a little more about what happens in Narnia after the story of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe ends.  The Special Two-Disc Collector's Edition of this movie is truly the complete package - and a must for Narnia fans.\n",
      "we just got this in the mail and watched it last night ~ it was a great family movie night\n",
      "Narnia, was a good DvD and I give it 5 stars. Prince Casprin is a little bit better then the first, but this DvD is worth to buy if you want to watch the journay from the beginning!\n",
      "I just went to see this movie for the second time, and all I can say is, AMAZING!This brilliantly captures the world of Narnia, and I don't see how they could have done it better.  I have seen an old version from the 80s that was almost exactly like the book, but had some of the most horrid cinematography I had ever seen, but I loved the books anyway, so I was really excited when I heard about this movie, and I definitely was not disappointed.The actors do a very good job, especially considering how young some of them were.  Graphics are just plain superb, and they really help to make the world come to life.  Also, the score is fantastic, it fit with the film perfectly.I was really shocked as I read through some of the reviews on here however.  And I don't mean to make anyone mad here, but I really must say to all of the people who gave the movie 3 stars or less, did you watch the same movie I did?  All of the major complaints people have are completely baseless.  Ok, so it could have done without the ice floe scene, but that is really the only thing I can find wrong with it.And to the people comparing it to Lord of the Rings, you have no business doing so.  In fact, if that's all you can see in this movie, you probably don't have any business writing a review at all.  Anyone who knows anything about Narnia could tell you it is not the same story as the Lord of the Rings, and the movies reflect that.  Narnia is in no way not as good a movie because of this; in fact, that makes it a better movie than it would have been if they tried to make it like LotR.  And I don't see how there were even a few people who said it was like a shortened version of LotR.  That is the most bogus comment I have ever heard.So, to sum it all up, unless you come into the movie with a pre-disposition to not like it, you should love it and see what a masterpiece it is.Oh, and just as a side note, I saw a review saying that Christians were attacking this movie...?  I don't know where that came from, but every Christian organization I know of that has said anything about it has been strongly encouraging people to go see it.  Although everyone should go to watch it anyway, even if you aren't a Christian you will enjoy it.Happy viewing!\n",
      "I have to admit, Narnia is an excellent movie that will stand the test of time! It's a true saga, like the Lord Of The Rings!What moved me most was how each of the four children & teens grew, as individuals, and as a family unit. It's so easy to be selfish and only think about one's own needs. It's refreshing to see characters not only being concerned with each others well being, but also with the the community-at-large. One, which is so incredibly alien, it takes a lot of courage to care!In the world of Narnia, these four young people have real power! Their decisions have incredible consequences! One choice is to take risks, the other to retreat into safety and comfort. The adults in the audience, I'm sure, can identify with this tug-of-war. This quandary effects us all at some point in our lives.Another theme addressed is War. The opening scene shows the bombing of London during World War 2. I knew someone who actually lived through this experience as a child. It left lifelong scars. In the very beginning we see train loads of children being evacuated to family, friends, or even benevolent strangers in the much safer countryside. I said to myself, this is what war is really about: desperation and separation. It brought tears to my eyes. If anyone had experienced what my English friend did, first hand, as a child, they would think twice before starting or supporting war, period!While a war is fought in Narnia, this one is to prevent the collapse of civilization, at the hands of evil geniuses, just like in Lord Of The Rings or World War 2. Perhaps, if that was the standard the human race could agree on to wage war, then this ancient scourge would, indeed, finally become a thing of the past!The filmmakers should be congratulated for bringing a fairly complex story to the big screen with dignity and inspiration. I'm sure C.S. Lewis would be proud!P.S. I saw this magnificent film a second time, and I'm glad I did! The feelings of elation and awe are much appreciated! Memo to Hollywood: Start making more movies which are uplifting and your bottom line will uplift, too!\n",
      "very creative movie.Except, I did not like the kidnapping of the small girl to the wooden tree scene.It was also very religious in effects if you review the references.\n",
      "A beautiful movie. A classic tale of Good vs Evil. An allegory that innocence and faith can defeat the most overwhelming odds.I never read the books but because of the movie I'm going to start on the whole saga.\n",
      "I saw this the day it hit theaters, and I've seen it a total of three times. It's an excellent movie, with good values, and it's good for kids. But that doesn't mean adults can't enjoy it either.It's very emotional, and some point of the movie is bound to make you cry. The four child stars had excellent acting, which isn't something a lot of child stars can do. Georgie Henley can actually cry, which will make you cry also cause she's so cute. I have the book, but haven't gotten around to reading it yet. I've started on the first book, \"The Magician's Nephew,\" which could possibly be made into a movie too, since they say they want to do all seven of the books on film. I hear the DVD is suppose to come out in April around Easter.I went and saw it today for the third time, and I cried more this time than the other two. Of course they're a few things that weren't accurate to the book, but you can't expect a movie to be just like the book word for word. For those who complain about too much unneeded action, you have to see it from a child's point of veiw. A child won't stay quiet through a movie if it's long and dull. Maybe if you're reading a book you can be patient, but not while watching a movie.It's an escape from reality, and I like it more than Lord of the Rings, which is my favorite movie.The characters are what I expected, and way better than those BBC versions from the old versions made for PBS. They're all very likable, even Edmund, who betrays his family. I actually felt bad for him, where as in the PBS version all I wanted to do was strangle him cause he was so annoying. And James McAvoy as Tumnus is a lovable creature, who I also felt very bad for after he got captured.I don't think the special FX were THAT bad. Aslan looked pretty real, and the battle sequence was very well done, without showing blood. A lot of kids were afraid of the White Witch at the theater though. But everyone clapped after the movie ended, and it's pretty obvious why. This is such a good movie, and something different from the weird movies that are coming out nowadays. Even if you haven't read the book, or even heard of it, go see it anyway. Give it a chance. This is a movie that will be remembered for a long time, and outlast whatever is currently in theaters.\n",
      "We actually had purchased this movie before and the grandkids have watched it over and over.  The disk became scratched so I replaced it and they never seem to get tired of it.\n",
      "I actually watched The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and then I decided to read it.  I have to say that this is a mostly faithful adaptation (as they cannot do everything in the book.  I thought the things that they added or deleted did not take away from the overall story and even made it more visually effective).  What I notice most is that the scenery is gorgeous and definitely seems to be what is described by C.S. Lewis.  The 4 kid actors do a terrific job (Edmund was great at being the brat!  Peter was annoying, though, but that's ok because he was pretty annoying in the book as well).  I also thought that Liam Neeson was a perfect fit for the voice of Aslan and that Tilda Swinson captured the essence of the White Witch (kind of looked like Cate Blanchett in Lord of the Rings).  One of the great things with this movie (as well as Lord of the Rings) is that it has awesome special effects AND a great story line.  I hope that all 7 will be made into movies and judging by how much money it made in the box office, I am sure that it will.  Overall, this movie was well acted, the story was very cohesive, the talking animals were great, and the special effects were great.  Narnia became alive and this movie and I hope it is here to stay.\n",
      "My grandson loves this movie, he enjoys playing it over and over again, we like watching it as a family, Good Movie!\n",
      "I have watched this over and over, since I have been a special effects fan forever.  This C.S. Lewis story was always one of my favorites and the movie is very well done.\n",
      "Through some sweet connections (or a fluke), I was able to attend a pre-screening of the film. Having tracked the film's progression for `only' the past three years, it was definitely a highlight of the month. Dressed in chain mail fabric facsimile, a fine royal red tunic with the rampant yellow lion emblem on the front, and a cloak (left over from Return of the King) wrapped about my shoulders for warmth, I joined my sister (dressed as the White Witch), brother and friend in walking in to the theater.But you don't care what I was wearing or who I went with; you want to know about the FILM.You almost certainly know the basics by now. Four children are sent away to the countryside during the air raids, to the house of an old professor. There, Lucy (the youngest, portrayed by Georgie Henley) finds a magic wardrobe which ushers her into a wonderful, wintry country. She meets Mr. Tumnus, a faun (half-man, half-goat, superbly portrayed by James McAvoy), and learns about the country and its cruel ruler, the White Witch. The scenes are carried off delightfully. If one can use the term \"chemistry\" without signaling thoughts of love or romance, then that is the fitting word. Tumnus is enlisted to watch for humans and deliver them to the witch, but helps her escape instead. Lucy returns to find that no time has passed - and that no one believes her.Edmund (portrayed by Skandar Keynes), the brat of the family, mocks her until he too stumbles after her into the wardrobe. He meets the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), and upon returning from Narnia, spites Lucy by insisting there is no such place. But their two older siblings, Peter (William Mosley) and Susan (Anna Popplewell) are soon brought into Narnia with them, where they learn that their coming has been prophesied for ages, and that they are destined to be entangled in the very thing they were sent away from; war. Edmund slips away to the White Witch, with betrayal in mind, and the other three children must flee the White Witch's wolf-minions. Aided by the beavers (Ray Winstone, Dawn French), they meet the somewhat messianic lion king Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) and must contend with Edmund's treachery, and the armies of the White Witch.POSITIVE: This is truly an excellent film. Obviously, someone who dresses up in costume won't be exiting the theater thinking it stunk, but it really was. The roles of C.S. Lewis's literary creations come to life splendidly in all four of the children, in the good and bad creatures, and in the snowy landscapes. The creatures for good are wonderfully performed, particularly in Orieus (Patrick Kake) the centaur (half-human, half-horse) who was an excellent hero role, and got too little screen time in my opinion. The White Witch is carried out magnificently by Tilda Swinton. When we first meet her, she is enchanting and charming towards Edmund, a perfect mother-figure. But her presence as the epicenter of evil in Narnia is entirely convincing as well.The battle scenes are edge-of-your-seat action, yet not too heavy or dark as some have contended scenes from the `Rings' trilogy were. No blood, but that doesn't mean no violence. (Obviously, no profanity or sexual content of any sort)Most know how the story will turn out, but the best part of the film is the little moments, the execution and screenplay while carrying out the plot, that make it all so much better.NEGATIVES: Don't go into this film with Lord of the Rings in mind. In accordance with the BOOK, the movie succeeds and excels in its performance. But it does not rival the scope of Lord of the Rings. It is not meant to. I was fighting to remove Lord of the Rings from my repertoire so I could take the film in by itself. If you look to Narnia to outperform Lord of the Rings, you will be disappointed.Also, you must know that the story of Narnia has been personalized in so many different ways, ways that director Andrew Adamson could not possibly live up to. Lewis painted with strokes broad enough to leave much to the imagination. Thus, while YOUR mental image of Tumnus may not match the one on the screen, the one on the screen works just as well, or better. So you may be telling yourself \"that's not how I pictured Tumnus, but...I like it!\"Along those same lines, let's talk about Aslan. Aslan is an exceptional character in the book, whether you accept the concept of his deity or not. You can connect with him in the book. To put it another way, you get the \"warm fuzzy.\" Yet in the film, nothing seems to distinguish him from all the other talking creatures. Even the music (composed by Harry Gregson-Williams, and magnificently done in almost all other aspects) doesn't truly hype the Aslan scenes up enough to know \"this is not just an `ordinary' talking lion.\" Even his stature, that of an ordinary lion, makes him look UP into the eyes of the four children, and that doesn't seem fitting.I'm sure it's difficult to live up to the imaginings of a God-like lion, so we can forgive the filmmakers. In all other aspects, the film meets and surpasses expectations. Just be aware of some things not to expect when you walk into the theater.CAN KIDS SEE IT?: If your kids saw Harry Potter, then yes. Otherwise, there are evil creatures likeunto Lord of the Rings which might frighten younger viewers.SUMMING UP: This movie won't take the place of your imagination, the books, or the two combined. But like Lord of the Rings, it now provides us another window into the world of Narnia. Not the same as Lewis gave us, but another. It allows us to see things from a different perspective, new and fresh. I give this movie a resounding ten stars out of ten.\n",
      "There is one scene in Andrew Adamson's new film THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, that for me walking into the theater that needed to be perfect. If not the whole movie and (the continued franchise of sequels) would fall flat on its face. If the film did not capture this scene I believe the heart and soul of C.S. Lewis and his magical world would have been completely destroyed.But I digress!Walking into Narnia is an interesting experience for me. In all honesty I find C.S. Lewis to be a great writer that I can hardly read. His books are hailed left and right and I just can't read them. It's not Lewis's fault. I realize it's my own media saturated thick head that blocks me up. So a few weeks ago after a screening of a 10 minute super trailer for NARNIA I decided to dust off my old copy of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA and decided to give it a chance. I read the first two books in about a week and I wondered to myself. What was my problem? What took me so long to become enchanted by this mystical world? I've come to realize I cannot appreciate the classics. I really think that's my loss and something I intend to work on in the new year.So anyway, sitting down in the movie theater I psyched myself up I intended to be wowed. I wanted Narnia to come alive onscreen like it did in my mind and I think it fell a little short of my expectations but in the end made me smile.NARNIA tells the story of four children. When the youngest named Lucy (Georgie Henley) finds a magic wardrobe that transports her into the magical land of Narnia. Narnia is a land of talking animals, magical fauns, and the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton) whose enslaved the land causing it to be forever winter and never Christmas. Her sister Susan (Anna Popplewell), and brothers Peter (William Moseley), and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) don't believe her story. Until the day all the children enter the Land of Narnia. A land and get caught up in a war that may fulfill a prophecy that will bring peace to Narnia.NARNIA is a fascinating example of a film that doesn't exactly add up but in the end is satisfying. The screenplay is riddled with the problems from the very beginning. It tries so hard to stick to the book that the early moments of the film feel flat. Even when the children get to Narnia you feel the same way. Narnia feels just like the British Country side the children have come from. Narnia should feel different and it doesn't. Why is their a light post growing in the middle of the forest? Why are the animals talking? Why is it always winter and yet never Christmas? These questions should inspire awe. NARNIA should glow and jump off the screen, but the first act is to busy getting from point a to point b than to allow us to immerse ourselves in the NARNIAN landscape. If your like me you'll find yourself thinking \"why does this feel like a third rate LORD OF THE RINGS?\"I think what's missing is the thing that made the novel so enchanting. It's Lewis's self aware narration. Even when at the greatest peril it was Lewis's kind words and silly aside comments that lightened the situation. Admittedly that would be difficult in a film but It would have been nice if they'd tried. Instead they stuck humor in places that seemed out of place.But fear not, all is not lost. Because if you can get through the first hour (which really isn't that bad). You'll come out on the other side and into a much better and powerful movie. Once Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) the Mighty Lion comes on the screen you're in for the ride of your life.I mentioned earlier there is one scene that needed to be perfect or the film would be destroyed. That scene involves Aslan and the stone table. They got it right, and oh boy was I impressed. If Aslan is not strong, if Aslan is not seen as a threat even as he is being tormented this scene falls apart. But Adamson and his team make Aslan a character to be reckoned with. If you don't gasp as Aslan climbs those stairs and the beasts and the White Witch part the way for him, if you don't feel the pain and anguish of Aslan's torment, and if your tear ducts don't well up when the scene is over, I would doubt your humanity ( just a little.)After that the film only gets better, there is an awesome battle sequence, and even Narnia begins to take a life of its own. It gives each character their moment to shine and it wraps itself up neatly enough. After the film was over I can't wait for PRINCE CASPIAN (or THE HORSE AND HIS BOY) to hit the big screen.I would also like to single out little Georgie Henley (watch out Dakota Fanning) the little girl who plays Lucy. She gives the early part of the film a lot more life and fills the screen like very few child actors can. This little girl (in her debut role) has an innocence and yet a maturity that belies her age. This little girl gives a performance that should really net her an Oscar nod. It probably won't but if I didn't bring it up who would?While this film has a few rough spots and a first act that needed some work THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is an enchanting journey that is worth the price of admission. Seek it out.\n",
      "This movie is a wonderful visual and auditory interpation of based on some of the most magical and inspiring books of all time written by one of the most brilliant men ever.\n",
      "I did not know very much about The Chronicles of Narnia before seeing the film, just the basic thread of the story.  So what I knew of the film and the story I had seen in trailers and a single review that I read.  I found the film to be an extraordinary adventure.  I must confess that not knowing the books when I first saw the trailers I was not at all sure I wanted to see the film.  Seeing is believing, however, and I am hopeful that more of the Narnia books might be filmed.First off, the casting of the film was excellent, particularly the roles of Peter, Edmond, Susan and Lucy.  Also, James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus was really excellent and made a perfect faun.  Perhaps the real stars are the people who produce the CGI effects with Aslan being the star in that area of production.  Voiced by Liam Neeson, Aslan truly comes alive as the noble and self-sacrificing leader that he is.  C. S. Lewis would be impressed, I think, on how well his book has been brought to the screen.  Without CGI Narnia would not be half as spectacular.  There are so many different creatures in Narnia that it was hard to single them all out.The violence of the battle has been commented upon by other reviewers and I agree with those who did not find the scene troubling.  There is less violence than The Lord of the Rings and care was taken to make it as bloodless as possible.  Even the death of the White Witch is off camera.  Certainly, the death of Aslan is a bit of a shock but one has the feeling that something will intervene and bring Aslan back.  The touching concern of Susan and Lucy seems to guarantee that this is not the end.The Chronicles of Narnia is a memorable film that I will recall with pleasure and scenes like the White Witch's first appearance in her sleigh drawn by white reindeer with be etched in my memory.\n",
      "CS Lewis's story of the four Pevensie children's (Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley, and Anna Popplewell) adventures in the land of Narnia comes to the screen as a big-budget, digital spectacle.  Although the battle, which was summarized in only a few bloodless paragraphs of the novel, takes up a good part of the running time--and, no doubt, the budget--of the film, the tone of the book is largely preserved.  The children are perfectly cast and Narnia portrayed as a generally friendly place, except for occasional appearances by the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and her cronies.  I like big battle scenes, so the shift of emphasis to spectacle from character didn't bother me, but strict admirers of the novel may be disappointed.\n",
      "This movie faithfully portrays the story from the book.  There is enough violence that you should consider the age of the viewers.\n",
      "C.S.Lewis' classic series The Chronicles of Narnia has long awaited a decent movie rendition. This is a great start. Now to see if they follow thru with the remaining stories.NOTE: To get the best value from these movies, you really should read them.\n",
      "loved the moviegreat color and soundreceived it super-fast!!!thank you!!this vendor is greatd\n",
      "The content of the movie is gone over in a number of the reviews, so I will just give my opinions of the movie in general and leave the telling of the story to others.I saw this movie shortly after its release and enjoyed it immensely.  I have read the books and listened to them on audiotape again recently, and yes, I enjoy the series.  One thing that should be mentioned is that the Narnia series was written for children (my wife tells me I'm just a big kid!) and therefore the fantasy tale will stretch the imagination of adults (we are always looking for reality - hardly the point of a children's fantasy movie.)  There are things better explained in the book, but then to put them in the movie would have people complaining the movie was too long.With a couple of exceptions, I thought the special effects were fantastic.  I can see why some would compare this to the \"Lord of the Rings\" series, but I'm not sure that is a fair comparison.  While I think Narnia was well done, the \"Lord of the Rings\" movies are unlikely to be surpassed for quite some time, and Narnia does not do that.  However, I felt it did do an excellent job on C. S. Lewis' classic tale.There is violence in the Narnia series, but nowhere near the amount in the \"Ring\" series, and the way it is done seems to be designed to keep this a children's movie.  I'm glad - there is plenty of gratuitous violence in Hollywood, and this movie doesn't need it.  I also felt that the characters with the witch seemed more completely evil than I imagined them from the book (almost like they were trying to mimic the Orcs from the \"Ring\" series), but that is a minor quibble, or just a matter of opinion.  All in all, I came away refreshed after seeing this movie.Just a quick side note - I also enjoyed the \"Lord of the Rings\" movies and consider them some of the best movies of all time, but they are designed for a different audience.  My comments comparing \"Narnia\" to that movie are with the fact that \"Narnia\" was designed for children kept in mind.  While there were many children at the \"Lord of the Rings\" movies, I personally wouldn't recommend them for children.I suppose it would be correct to say that this movie isn't for everyone - just read some of the reviews - but I believe it is a safe movie to take your kids too.  Most people I talked to seemed to enjoy it, and you might even find that you do as well.  I look forward to its release on DVD.\n",
      "Really Really Good show ......We enjoyed it a good family film with values added!We've seen it before years ago & it was like seeing it for the first time again.\n",
      "THE BOOKS YOU LOVED AS A CHILD ARE BROUGHT TO LIFE ON SCREEN IN A REMARKABLE WAY....I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEQUELS\n",
      "We started this novel for my son's 3rd grade literature class and after 5 chapters, decided to see the movie because we were enjoying the book so much, we knew the movie would be splendid, and it did not disappoint us in the slightest - the movie is fairly close to the book, and is a visual treat. The cinematographer's work was painterly and so carefully attended to - each frame in itself is like a picture. The cast are just perfect, every one of them, though I dare say I don't know any of them as they are all British actors (as they should be). All in all a wonderful movie-from-book, one that holds up to several viewings as there is such rich detail within so there are things you might miss on the first run-through that you will catch on a subsequent viewing. Enjoy this one, folks!\n",
      "Excellent movie - the subutle christian values and very well done. The special effects are outstanding andthe story line perfect.\n",
      "When I heard that a new big screen adaptation of the lion the witch and the wardrobe was going to hit the big screen I was excited. Then I heard it was a Disney venture. My heart stopped leaping. Still, as an avid fan of the chronicles, I had to go and see this incredible looking (in trailers) spectacle. Largely, I was very pleased. I loved the acting, the effects and especially the characters such as the beavers and other creatures who were made so real, they could almost steal the movie unto themselves. What upset me a bit was the black and white structure of the good versus evil base of the movie. Sure that is there in the book and other iterations brought to life through the BBC and others through the years, But ultimately, it is so much more colorful a tale than what was portrayed here. There is no need to dumb down the story to appeal to more audiences and this is the one big gripe I have about epic novels of this sort being made into films. It doesn't have to be this way, and that has been made so apparent with the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Overall however, I have to say that this version of the classic CS Lewis novel is a spectacle of grand proportions mostly done right, unlike the usual fare of the Disney drivel. If you are a fan of the books, by all means see this adaptation but if you want the true feel of the book, see the BBC version or other versions in addition to this one. Sure the effects aren't as good, but they should only be second fiddle to such an amazing story anyway.\n",
      "This review is about the blu-ray transfer and not the film itself (everything that needs to be said about the latter has already been said).I was generally pleased with the quality of the transfer.  Regarding the audio, Aslan's voice (Liam Neeson) resonates deeply; battle sounds clash viscerally; the musical score is clear.  As for the visuals, daytime shots are crisp and detailed.  Colors pop.  While some of the special effects are not quite to the level of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, they are still quite good, and this blu-ray lets us see them in sharp detail.  Lowlight shots were more problematic, however.  While there was not much film grain, there were a few evening scenes where the lighting would alternate from shot to shot, sometimes lighter, sometimes darker.  I have never seen anything quite like that on a blu-ray before.  It was not terribly annoying, but it did draw attention to itself and pull you out of the fictive dream for a moment.With this quibble aside, I highly recommend this movie for viewers of all ages.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is worth it.\n",
      "THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE is probably the only film I have ever looked forward to seeing which opened exactly the way I had envisioned.  It's the story of four siblings from London who are sent (along with thousands of other English children) to live in the country, away from the Blitzkrieg bombing of Hitler's Third Reich.  The movie, therefore, opens not like a LORD OF THE RINGS fantasy film but more along the lines of BATTLE OF BRITAIN.  The children were all perfectly cast, especially Edmund and Lucy.  Aslan is just as grand and glorious as I ever imagined him to be in the books.While staying in an enormous country house belonging to an old, mysterious professor, the youngest child discovers another world via a wardrobe where all four children are caught up in a mystical war, where they are believed by the good guys to be long-prophecied kings and queens who will reign and restore freedom and order.  It is also a land where a noble Lion named Aslan lives.  Aslan is often alluded to as the Christ-figure in the seven Narnia books.Overall, this movie is pure enchantment just like the books, and since it is a Disney film, just like the old-school Disney films (e.g. the ones that were made under Walt Disney's personal supervision).This film contains no profanity (and no blasphemy), no sexual immorality, and not even any gratuitous violence.  It's just great entertainment with creative storytelling and quality production as its foundation.  If you're a C.S. Lewis fan or you're just looking for some exciting and wholesome family entertainment that adults and children can enjoy together then you can trust THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE.\n",
      "I have never read any C.S. Lewis books and knew nothing of Narnia. I had tears in my eyes several times in this movie. It was so touching and great. Was it because I am a Christian? Yes definitely. I did not need the book to understand this movie. It is beyond words. To me, I can't wait for the DVD. I am also going to see this again in the theaters. My 17 year old daughter saw it with me and my 18 year old and The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe is now there favorite movie of all time.  Even passing the Lord of the Rings!They just understand it better and are more child like in their understanding. I can't really explain it, But I can't get enough of this movie. It is the best! No Blood! No bad language, just a great story that was well presented.Go see it!By The Way, There seems to be a lot of reference to Disney like, Disney did this and Disney did that!People, Disney had absolutely nothing to do with this movie being made. They paid for advertising and released and distributed it. It was made by Walden Media. Controlled by C.S. Lewis's stepson to be faithful to the book. C.S. Lewis's grandson is satisfied with the movie. If Disney had made this, the Christian allegory would have been toned way down and then The movie would not have been made. Nuff Said\n",
      "once again the books are better. But this is a great family movie. There is a bit of a war in it.\n",
      "This is in the wrong department. I love Narnia. I am taking a course \"The Life and Teachings of C. S. Lewis\" and need The Magicians Nephew, and The Last Battle. So rather than only having a partial Chronicles of Narnia set, I wanted to buy one book with all 7 series in it. I almost bought this DVD set thinking it was a book because it is listed under books and says hardcover next to the title. Then I noticed the cover said Disney and Walden media (or something similar, I don't remember the exact wording) presents . . . a four disc set. So then I thought maybe it's an audio book. I figured it would be best if I read the reviews first to investigate what the product actually is. Will the appropriate person please place this product in the correct department? That would help customers like me to not order the wrong product. Thanks.\n",
      "Fine yarn--action-packed thriller. My children loved it!  We liked it better than the book.  There are some scary scenes.  Parents may want to preview before young children view it.\n",
      "My grandchildren, and I watch this all the time. Great movie. I have recommend it to many friends. A classic.\n",
      "Quite true to the book.  I love James McAvoy's faun.  And little Lucy is perfect.  Great art direction and costume design help take us into wartime England and then to Narnia.  Kate Blanchett's Ice Queen is terrible and wonderful, just as she should be.\n",

      "Good Gift for any Narnia Lover. However not the pack to get for someone who may not like, or hasn't seen the movie/read the book.  Disc One has the movie, commentary, and bloopers. It also has the extended version with additional scenes. Disc Two- In depth look at the worlds of Narnia.Disc Three- About C.S. Lewis the man who created Narnia.Disc Four- Behind the Battle, Art, and Visuals. Comes with nice case. [...]\n",
      "This is a good classic movie. I purchased it as an Amazon instant video as a reward for my students after a difficult week of state testing. They loved it.\n",
      "Not in HD, which was disappointing, but price was so much cheaper that VUDU. Grandkids enjoyed it and that's what counts\n",
      "This movie being the first of the series is well worth owning, as are the others in the series.  They are beautifully done and so enjoyable and are metaphors of the bible.  You can enjoy these with the entire family.  You too will fall in love with Narnia and want to visit again and again through the wardrobe.  Great movies indeed.\n",

      "I saw the movie once and had to add it to my collection.  ea I would recommend it to others\n",
      "I saw this movie when it came out in December and was completely blown away. I mean, the book was great, the made-for-TV cartoon movie was OK...but this was INCREDIBLE!First, there was Georgie Henley, who played Lucy. Not only was she just plain cute, she was great as an actress! Some of her crying scenes were incredibly believable...like when Lucy & Susan go into the witch's castle and see Mr. Tumnus as a statue. Well, I'm kind of known in the family for being the one who cries at movies (heck, I cried the first time I saw \"Lilo & Stitch\"!), but after everyone had been crying over the big \"sacrifice-and-resurrection\" scene, what was I doing? Watching Georgie crying over the faun statue and crying because she was crying and...well, you get the picture. She's GOOD, I'm not kidding!Skandar Keynes (Edmund) was another great actor. Before seeing the movie, I re-read the book and when I realized that they'd have to do the thing where Edmund's injured, I thought, \"Well, that'll be interesting.\" I was wrong. It wasn't interesting, it was downright amazing. And if you listen to the commentary on the DVD, the director says that he never thought that Skandar would cry. Well, Skandar cried all right, and I'm sitting there thinking, \"How'd they do this? These kids are AMAZING!\" I laughed pretty hard at the Turkish Delight scene---it doesn't really get much cuter than seeing a woman trying to convince a kid to get his siblings to go to Narnia, while the kid's just sitting there, stuffing himslef with junk food and insisting that he's the special one! (A little bit of useless trivia here: Skandar had to eat about 35 pieces of that stuff during filming! Yikes!)The other two kids, Anna Popplewell (Susan) and William Moseley (Peter) were good, too, but I really thought that the two younger ones did a better job acting.The adults were excellent. I think that Tilda Swinton made a great witch, and I'm glad that the filmmakers didn't go with the classic \"witch\" look---black and green, stringy hair, you know---and did it the way that they did. The extras like the ogres, minotaurs, and centaurs were very fun to watch. James McAvoy and Georgie Henley shared that perfect Lucy-Tumus chemistry. Their reaction in the first Narnia scene was pretty much real: I think that was the first time they saw each other in full costume. I know that it was the first time they saw the Narnia set.And that's just the movie! The stuff behind the scenes is even funnier! Like the bloopers reel: in just about ten minutes, you get to see Skandar lock himself in the wardrobe, the minotaur trip on the battlefield, the prop man break something on the model of Aslan, and Georgie forgetting her lines.Same thing with the audio commentary. I loved hearing about the on-set \"potty mouth bucket\" and how the kids had to keep changing clothes for about a week because of inconsistent weather.Overall: five stars. I'd give it 100 if I could but I can't because Amazon only lets you rate up to five.Get the DVD. You won't be disappointed---I hope. (Just kidding!)\n",
      "What can I say about this set that hasn't already been said.  If you geek out at the Chronicles of Narnia or are a fellow brother in Christ then this is the set that will serve you best.  The behind the scenes features on making the film and about Lewis himself are phenomenal.  Better hurry though because I believe it is out of print already.\n",

      "This 127-minute live-action version of Clive Staples Lewis' classic fairy tale is colourful and impressive, and the young actors and actresses perform very well. At 32 I would have liked a bit more grit and realism, perhaps, but Lewis wasn't Tolkien, and this is a children's story first and (I suppose) foremost. Most of the casualties are monsters of some kind, and there is very little blood - even on just-used swords, which annoyed me a little. But these details changes do less to make the film unsuitable to adults, and more to simply invite children to join its viewership, and from the viewpoint of a European, at least, \"The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe\" is a wonderful fairy tale for anyone from the age of eight or there about. Some scenes are certainly frightening, but the overall tone is far less dark than, say, \"The Lord Of The Rings\".Tilda Swinton is radiant and charismatic as Jadis, the White Witch, and Liam Neeson voices Aslan the Lion with warmth and just the right amount of otherwordly dignity. Little Georgie Henley (Lucy Pevensie) displays more acting chops at nine than many highly-paid actresses at thirty, and Scotsman James MacAvoy is a charming and quite British Mr Tumnus.The Christian subtext has perhaps been toned down a little here and there, but it is still very palpable, especially in the...well, in one particular scene. If you are on of the two or three hundred people in the English-speaking who don't know the story, I'm not going to ruin it for you.If I am to complain a little bit (and I am), I'll say that certain scenes feel a bit rushed, like Lucy's meeting with the faun and Edmund's first encounter with the White Witch. This is one movie which could have used that extra half-hour of playing time that so many movies get for no good reason whatsoever. But the overall impression? Great stuff. Touching, thrilling, charming, and not as Disneyfied as I had feared.\n",
      "We hadn't watched any of the Chronicles movies as our kids were too young. We bought these two movies and watched them right away and our kids loved them. The price was good too.\n",
      "The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe is based from the first Book in the Chronicle of Narnia series by C.S. Lewis.  The book was actually required reading in my elementary school, so I was already quite familiar with the story.  There was an animated film created years ago, but it was very uninspiring, and I believe it to have been a direct to video release.  I was more than ecstatic when I learned the a real movie was coming to theatres, and the previews looked tremendous.  It was enough to assure that this was going to be big.  Epic big, as in The Lord of The Rings traditional sense.  The movie did not let me down.  It started out a little slow, but by time the climax approached, something triggered all kinds of positive emotions within.  This is a powerful tale, and perhaps even more powerfully transfered to the big screen.There are two ways of looking at this film.  One, is for pure entertainment.  The second, is on a religious perspective.  C.S. Lewis has been known for being a Christian author, and fascinated with placing religious events into fantasy lands.  It is very evident that this movie has those influences, and any watcher will pick up on the Biblical references throughout the story.  I actually chose option three, and that was watching it both for entertainment and for its content, and in the end, I felt I had watched something very satisfying and very complete.Happiness, excitement, despair, hope, and even war.  They are all in this film, and there are all well felt.  Its not just the story alone that shares practically all forms of emotion and character, and not even the characters in the film too, but the cinematography, directing, and musical score add so much to complete the tone.  The camera gives us plenty of wonderful sweeping shots of the landscape, which begins as winter in Narnia and eventually shoots into spring.  The score, is worth purchasing on cd.  Every scene of music fits so well and is so neat with what is going on in Narnia.  Then you have the final climatic showdown, where the good vs evil armies fight in war.  The score is both energetic and iluminating, getting you pumped to cheer on the good guys (or bad, if you wish).Perhaps one of the coolest things about the film are some of the effects, and more specifically, the way the creatures are used.  This isn't like Lord of The Rings where you got some elves and orcs - you generally have a mix of hundreds of creatures and animals in Narnia.  Bears, tigers, bulls, oxen, and wolves are just a few that shine, and all clash in the final battle.Another wonderful thing about this film is it is well suited for people of all ages.  If it weren't for the big battle in the end, this would easily have been a G rated film.  Though the fights go on for maybe a total of 10 minutes, there is no blood and the camera does a smooth job of skipping the details of swords piercing through bodies.Overall, this is a wonderful film that would make most feel really good when walking away.  Though most people will clearly see the religious refernces, there is great entertainment value in this too.Acting - 4Action - 4.5Characters - 5Story - 4.5Overall - 4.5\n",
      "I was hesitant to put too much confidence in this movie, as I have been disappointed by book-to-movie translations in the past.  However, this movie was very well done, keeping the points in the movie that the book emphasized. and doing a good job with it.  There are no digital effects that look hokey; they are all well done.I highly suggest all families see this movie.  The message of one person laying thier life on the line to save others is strong, especially for kids (and adults) that live in our self-centered world.Get this movie, and watch it over and over.\n",
      "I'm a believer and this is similar to the bible story - but not so in your face which people tend to shy away from. Excellent story.\n",

      "From the initial scenes in Britian, this movie grabs your attention and your heart.  The movie itself is well worth seeing as the story is timeless and the cinematography / effects are excellent.  The bonus features give a new level of insight into the story and making of the movie.  It was well worth the extra few dollars to get the collecters edition.\n",
      "\"The Chronicles of Narnia\" is a masterpiece of children's literature, consisting of seven fantasy novels by Professor C. S. Lewis (1898-1963). This film \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" has excellent cinematography, acting and special effects, as well as a good screen-play, as we would expect of a movie based on excellent literature. Thus, it honours the original novel as a work of art. Unfortunately, only three films have been produced so far. We must look forward to the release of the remaining four.\n",
      "Like most children growing up in England, I was enchanted by the Chronicles of Narnia, and with the Second World War still fresh in most peoples' minds, was soon exposed to the context and allegory of the tales.C.S. Lewis was one of the early members of the Inklings, a literary discussion group associated with the University of Oxford. Though most of its meetings took place in Magdalen College, there is also an old pub in Oxford called the Eagle and Child that still had a small display of memorabilia of the Inklings the last time that I was there. Apart from Lewis, other members included J.R.R. Tolkien, the philosopher and anthroposophist Owen Barfield, and Neville Coghill, who produced the modern version of the Canterbury Tales, and many other literary greats. There was a strong Christian thread running through the group, and enormous cross-pollination between these talented people. Their meetings took place between the late 1930s and the 1950s. So the Second World War - widely perceived at the time as the ultimate battle between good and evil, freedom and tyranny - colored much of the work of the Inklings. It is helpful to know that to understand the context of both the Lord of the Rings and Narnia.Until the advent of the Lord of the Rings, I had usually made it a point to miss filmed version of books, since they usually had to be butchered to fit into the 2-3 hour format. I would probably have missed this one, had it not been the featured movie on a recent flight, and I had finished the books that I had taken with me. It was so good that I have since watched it again.Yes, there is much that is missing. But a film of a book really shouldn't just be a visual rendering of the original: it needs the creativity and interpretations of the screenwriter, director and actors. It is also the first of the seven books that constitute the Chronicles. The cinematography is stunning and the child actors remarkable. As a former fencer, I thought it smart that the director didn't try to turn Peter into a master swordsman. He held and used his sword like a clumsy knife, which is exactly what an unschooled child would do. There were one or two strange things towards the end, when the children forget all about their parents to accept their crowns and play in Narnia. However great the prize, that does not ring true. But this is a minor quibble.I have always enjoyed books and films that transmit subtle positive messages, without the need for declaring them ahead of time. So this is indeed a fine movie for children old enough not to be upset by the violence, and it contains enough metaphor and allegory for all but the most hardened cynic.\n",
      "After Lord of the Rings, it was natural to see the release of the Chronicles of Narnia.  My fear, though, was that this would be the Chronicles of Narnia: The Lord of the Rings II.  Nothing against Lord of the Rings, it was a wonderful movie; but the story of Chronicles of Narnia is totally unlike the Lord of the Rings, and it cannot be made to fit that mold.Enter Andrew Adamson, director of Shrek, probably one of the greatest out of the box directors.  Andrew Adamson totally re-spun the film, this time with a PG rating.  In this film he focused on the charm and fantasy, what was largely what C. S. Lewis intended to be the stuff of Narnia.  The movie was full of intelligent but laugh-out loud humor; the colors were rich; the scenery was gorgeous; Narnia as a world felt far more real than the Lord of the Rings.Now, the downfalls.  Sadly, there were because of the PG (only) rating there was only a limited amount of violence that could be depicted.  The fight scenes were often skewed (but because they were not the bulk of the movie this is not as horrible a statement as it may seem.)The movie is exceptional and does stand on it's own.  This should not be considered the Lord of the Rings fan's second chance.  This is Narnia in and of itself.  (For the purists, this is virtually a direct adaptation.)  This movie is a solid 9/10.A delight.\n",
      "I have taught for over 9 years now and this book is one of my students and my favorites. What an incredible work!!! So I was very nervous about another visual attempt at depiction. I have now watched the movie 4 times and I like it better every time. My wife purchased it for my birthday. The paramount themes were not lost and even many of the less obvious connections and symbols are not lost.I highly recommend it. I am, however, amazed that this movie was given such a poor showing at the Oscars. This is not a reflection on the movie, but one on the politicizing of the Oscars. Public opinion is a much better measure.I anxiously await the next faithful rendition of C.S. Lewis' great works. In literature, we all owe Lewis a great debt. I strongly encourge the reading of all the series. I have read them many times and never tire of them.\n",
      "An outstanding movie to be watched by all ages. I enjoyed the first cinema made for this book in 1988 but it is incomparable to this version of The chronicles of Narnia. You must see this movie!\n",
      "I must say that when I first watched this film, I was a bit upset. Although it did capture the basic plot, it did lack some soul to it. Disney and Walden did water down some of the symbolism of the book that made it rich. I do not agree father christmas and the story came when the children came into narnia. Well it did partly happen because of them but because \"Aslan is on the move.\" It kind of made Aslan's significance smaller. Still, even if it captures just the surface text, the surface still says a lot. I cried twice over Aslan. Sure, one might say \"Yeah, right. The Passion of the Kitty.\" But if one would really understand what Aslan did for Edmund (similar to what Christ did for us), one would cry to bits like me.\n",
      "My grandchildren and I enjoy watching this movie produced by Walt Disney and Walden Media. There should be a Chronicle of Narnia II out and I plan on purchasing it also.\n",
      "The book is a 5 star out of 5 story. The movie almost gets there. It's visually stunning however I feel that the characters of Peter & Susan don't have much warmth. A bit too much complaining on their part in contrast to the heroic characters on Aslan's side.\n",
      "I found the Narnia books to be frightening. The first not particularly eventful fifteen minutes of the film communicated the same insecurity and vulnerability of children in a not necessarily loving world.  The Narnia in the film looks exactly as I imagined it and the mere mention of the White Witch gives me the shivers probably because I believe in the dangerous aggressiveness of a woman with narcissistic personality disorder.  And Edmund's changed personality and anger at his family were classic signals of child who had been molested.  Before reading the Narnia books, I had read Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale about the Snow Queen and similarly, the boy in the fairy tale was captivated and held captive by the Snow Queen who planted an icicle in his heart which only was melted by tears of love.\n",
      "For several years, fantasy films were MIA, except the occasional hack job.Then \"Lord of the Rings\" came and went, leaving some pretty big shoes to fill, as far as fantasy films go. \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe\" doesn't quite fit the shoes, but it comes a lot closer than any other movie has.In Andrew Adamson's adaptation, C.S. Lewis's classic fantasy novel comes alive with remarkable fidelity, sparkling special effects, and some truly excellent acting by almost everyone concerned. If \"Lord of the Rings\" was stern older brother Peter, then this movie is Lucy -- bright, swift and thoroughly charming.With WW II raging, the four Pevensie children are sent to the countryside, at an eccentric professor's mansion. But during a game of hide-and-seek, little Lucy (Georgie Henley) hides inside a wardrobe -- and stumbles into a wintry wilderness, with a faun she befriends. Alas, her brothers and sisters don't believe her -- but they don't know that Edmund (Skandar Keynes) has also gone through, and befriended a sinister, beautiful Witch (Tilda Swinton).Eventually all four end up going through the wardrobe, but but they soon find that the Witch is hunting for them, in fear that they will fulfil an ancient prophecy. But Edmund has run off to join the Witch. And so the remaining three must join up with Aslan (Liam Neeson), the leonine god-king of Narnia. But the price for victory against the Witch may be too high.Since \"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\" is labelled both a kids' book and a Christian fantasy, it's easy to get put off by the description of it. Don't be. Director Andrew Adamson (\"Shrek\" and \"Shrek 2\") has obviously given this his whole heart and soul, and it has the right mixture of majesty and humor that a film like this needed.And Adamson does a spectacular job. The the taut race across a frozen river, the bombing of London, tea with the faun Tumnus, and even the cameo by Father Christmas (who gets a medieval makeover) -- all of these come to life with remarkable skill and grace, but with respect for its audience's intelligence. The make-or-break scene is Aslan stalking to the stone table, and the horrifying sacrifice scene that follows does justice to Lewis' novel.But Adamson doesn't let it get overinflated on its own ego. When Edmund tells his horse, \"Whoa, boy!\" it retorts peevishly, \"My NAME is Philip!\"; elsewhere, the beavers snipe at each other like an old married couple. Those moments of lightness -- and giving Aslan a sense of humor -- keep the film from seeming self-conscious.And of course, the special effects. WETA workship deserves an award (it's been nominated for a few) for the amazing CGI, ranging from goat-legged Tumnus to the lion Aslan, who looks almost real. They are especially good in battle scenes, which are startlingly savage and brutal, but filled with outstanding moments, such as a centaur leaping over the Witch and nearly beheading her.Young Georgie Henley is probably the most capable actress here, conveying misery, awe, delight, childish glee and sorrow. All this from a small child, when a lot of adult actors can't manage that much. Skandar Keynes and Anna Popplewell turn in good performances as Edmund and Susan. Swinton and William Moseley (Peter) start off rather woodenly, but they both blossom when the four arrive in Narnia.Though Lewis was reportedly against a live-action adaptation of the Chronicles, it's hard to imagine him having a problem with this rapid-fire, sparkling adaptation. (And stay for the credits for an extra surprise...)\n",
      "My son and I just finished the book. We wanted to see the movie.  I'd forgotten that there are things I like about this movie -- the live action and magic.  I miss the words of Lewis but it was a fun movie.\n",
      "Some subtle and not so subtle changes through out the film including a scene with Harpies in the final battle sequence that was either cut to get the pg rating or wasn't ready special fx wise depending who you believe. Who Cares that scene is so cool and this movie just moves me I really enjoy it over and over. Much has been made of it's christian origins and I don't know why this movie just works and instant classic christian or not.\n",
      "I have seen this movie several time.  I liked so much that I gave if as a Christmas present to the sister of my God daughter.\n",
      "I remember it when I was a kid.I want my daughter to see it too.Hopefully she will love it too.\n",
      "The title of this review pretty much tells it all. This movie was wonderful. When it was out it was at the top in the box office and everyone I have talked to had told me how much they loved it. The 4 kids and main stars of the film are William Moseley(Peter), Anna Popplewell(Susan),Skandar Keynes(Edmund) and Georgie Heneley(Lucy). All 4 were wonderfully talented actors and they carried theirs roles well. The CG characters which are made by a computer were very good looking and somtimes it was hard to tell they were animated at all. Aslan who everyone has been looking forward to see looked amazing at the expressions in his face looked very real and it was as if you were looking into the face of a real lion at moments. This DVD is also loaded with bonus features like interviews,bloopers, and more. The thing I like most on disc too is probly the part called \"The Childrens Magical Journey\" in which is shows the whole process of making the movies from the kids points of views. The bloopers were funny and I found myself laughing alot and there was so much more I can`t even explain it all. :). But by far one of the best things about the movie was the story for in it Aslan sacrifices himself to save Edmund just like Jesus in the bible and the christian meaning behing C.S. Lewis`s writings all come to life in this VERY well done movie.\n",
      "This is a perfect film. With a perfect cast and a wonderful understanding of the original 'magic' of Narnia. C.S. Lewis would be proud and Walden Media did a great job.\n",
      "Watched after read book to my children and now reading book to them again and they are more keyed into the story.\n",
      "I thoroughly enjoyed this rendition of \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.\" Having read (and re-read) the book a number of times, the changes in the plot were obvious, but rather than detracting from Lewis's story, I think that they in some ways improve on the book. For one thing, the character development seems to have been strengthened in the movie.The first scene is of the bombing of London, and it introduces us especially to the personalities of Peter and Edmund Pevensie, who change the most throughout the movie. The Pevensies have just fled outside their home to escape the bombing when Edmund turns and runs back inside to get a picture of his father, who is fighting in World War II. Peter manages to catch up with him once inside and hauls him back to safety in disgust, with no consideration for Edmund's feelings. This introduces a pattern that we see a good deal of in the early part of the movie--Peter wants to take care of his siblings, but he doesn't quite manage, especially where Edmund is concerned. The opinions of Susan, the second-oldest, carry equal weight with Peter's at first, and for good reason.Lucy stumbles onto Narnia while hiding in a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek. She meets Tumnus, of course, and he takes her to his cave for tea. He plays a tune for her--a melody that sounds very authentically Narnian--and as he plays, fauns and other Narnian creatures seem to be dancing in the fire. The music has an almost hypnotic power over Lucy, who falls asleep watching the figures. Tumnus continues to play until the head of a lion appears in the fire, roaring, causing all the lights in the cave go out. This is our first introduction to Aslan.When Lucy comes out of the wardrobe, Edmund makes fun of her story by smirking about the football field he'd found in the bathroom cupboards. Peter tries to quiet him--rudely, deepening Edmund's resentment. So when Edmund follows Lucy into the wardrobe that night (Lucy sneaks back in to see whether Narnia is really there) we aren't surprised at how the White Witch manages to convince Edmund to bring his siblings to her by suggesting that they would be his servants. This chance to get on top of the pecking order is more than Edmund can handle, given the third-child syndrome that defines his character. The emphasis in the scene with the Witch is on his being the family misfit, not on the enchanted Turkish Delight.Lucy meets Edmund in Narnia and is so thrilled that she pounces on Peter, waking him up, to tell him that Edmund was in Narnia too. The young actors playing Edmund and Lucy handle the scene very well: the tiny smirk on Edmund's face after he sets Lucy crying by pretending Narnia is a game says it all.When Edmund breaks a window playing cricket, the children hide from the Professor's strict housekeeper in the wardrobe and wind up in Narnia. Edmund's resentment builds even more at the fur coat Peter gives him to wear as they explore. \"But that's a girl's coat!\" he protests. Peter, upset over Edmund's lie, merely says, \"I know.\" The children stumble on Tumnus's wrecked cave, at which point Peter and Susan both insist on going home to safety. However, Mr. Beaver meets them and brings them to his dam. He tells them about Aslan and how they are meant to fulfill the prophecy and stop the White Witch. Peter refuses, wanting to protect his siblings from danger. (A good change from the book--what protective older sibling wouldn't question staying in Narnia considering the Witch?) However, Edmund is missing. \"I'm going to kill him,\" Peter says in angry disgust. Mr. Beaver's grim answer is chilling: \"You may not have to.\" They chase after Edmund but don't catch him before he enters the Witch's ice castle. At this point, Peter has no choice but to find Aslan if he and the others are to save Edmund.They return to the dam so Mrs. Beaver can pack for their trip. However, Edmund betrays them to the Witch before he realizes her true intentions. The Secret Police wolves storm the dam, and the children and the Beavers escape through a secret tunnel. They are saved by a fox who is part of a sort of Narnian Underground. Then they continue onward to Aslan, nearly being caught on their way by the Witch and later by her wolves. Their journey is much more action packed than in the book, and I enjoyed the change.Edmund, meanwhile, is thrown into a dungeon by the Witch while the wolves storm the Beavers' dam, and there he meets a beaten-looking Tumnus and realizes how much damage he has done. (I was pleased that the directors focused more on Edmund than the book does, as he is my favorite character in the book.) The Witch turns Tumnus to stone, and Edmund's horror clearly shows that he has changed sides inwardly. The Witch takes him with her on the race to catch the other three children, and on the way her wolves bring the fox to her. She questions him, and when he won't answer, she raises her wand to turn him to stone. Edmund, desperate to stop her, gives her the information she wants. The fox is turned to stone anyway, but Edmund's inward change is made very evident by his unwise reaction.Edmund is eventually rescued from the camp of the Witch's army and makes up with his siblings. The Witch's coming into the camp and demanding Edmund's life is well done, as is the scene of Aslan's death. To the filmmakers' credit, the focus is not on the blood and gore--Aslan is not beaten by the Witch's creatures as in the book, and we do not see the knife entering his body. We instead share Lucy's horror as his eyes, meeting hers, widen and then close.I was also pleased that we got to see the actual battle (fighting but no blood) rather than the aftermath. Here Peter has completely stepped into his role of leader despite the fact that he knows Aslan is dead (Susan and Lucy sent a Dryad to tell their brothers) and that his army is outnumbered. His character development is complete. And Edmund puts his hard-won beliefs into action by smashing the Witch's wand. Peter, seeing the Witch then wound his younger brother, attacks and fights her. The fight seems unreal a few times (how did she not kill him when her swords were collaring his neck?) but is exciting. She finally trips Peter, knocks away his shield, and is ready to kill him when a resurrected Aslan, having arrived with the girls and reinforcements, pounces and kills her. (The statement in the book about \"the deeper magic\" that the Witch didn't know is eliminated in favor of her simply not understanding the Deep Magic because she didn't know the true meaning of sacrifice. Sacrifice to Aslan is giving of himself, but sacrifice to the Witch is sticking a lamb on an altar and slitting its throat.)Peter, Susan, and Lucy run to find the wounded Edmund, who is about to be killed by the Witch's dwarf when Susan shoots it with her bow. Lucy heals Edmund with a drop from her cordial and, at a look from Aslan, goes to help the other wounded.The next scene is the children's coronation, and then the stumbling of their grown-up selves back into their own world. (We can tell their growing younger as they begin to argue on their way through the coats. Though we do not actually see their transformation, we don't need to. The humor is stronger this way.) They fall out of the wardrobe to meet the professor, who is holding the cricket ball that started their adventure. I could not have asked for more and am eagerly awaiting the release of \"Prince Caspian.\"\n",
      "The story takes place during World War II in England. The four Pevensie children are sent away to a remote mansion in order to keep them safe from the air raids. While playing hide and seek one day, the youngest girl, Lucy, finds an intricately carved wooden wardrobe in which she found a magical world swathed in eternal, snowy winter. She meets the friendly fawn, Tumnus, whom she becomes friends with. (A fawn, by the way, is a creature that has the torso of a man and the legs of a goat.) Eventually Lucy urges her three other siblings to join her, thus embarking them on a quest to defeat an evil queen in order to bring the real king to the throne of Narnia.This movie was pure delight to watch. Not only was the cinematography exquisite, but the writers did a great job of bringing the magic of the book to the big screen. This has got to be one of the best movies a child can watch. It is one of those films that has the power to shape a child's future, kind of like the way the movie \"Return to Oz\" had an effect on me.One thing that I found flawed was not really in the movie itself, but in the actual story that C.S. Lewis wrote. It disturbed me how unbelievably selfish the brother Edmund is. His acts, deeds, and deception are just pure evil, and I cannot fathom how a brother could do what he did to his other siblings. Oh well, I guess this observation is severely subjective, but that's just how I feel.Another thing that was kind of awkward was the ending. I just thought it was very strangely executed, and to be honest it seemed a little confusing and rushed. However, the pure magic and imagination of this film are stunning and will ultimately win viewers over.\n",
      "This disc has it all: first-time extended film release, numerous commentaries, C.S. Lewis short, etc... A must buy!\n",
      "A snow covered fairy land bound by an evil white witch. A timid fawn carrying an umbrella. Talking beavers and other friendly animals. Tales of a great lion call Aslan who can make all things right.  Four children step through an old wardrobe and stumble upon this new and mysterious world where their destiny is suddenly thrust upon them, as it quickly becomes their job to not only help save Narnia, but one of their own as well. Based upon the all time classic by C.S. Lewis, \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" by Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media, is an excellent film production of a beloved fairytale where real life children are able to escape their own world to a magical land where they can become heroes to fight for truth.The story opens with the four Pevensie children: Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmond (SkandarKeynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley) being sent away from their London home to great country side manor of an old professor to escape the bombing raids of WWII. One day while playing an animated game of \"hide-and-seek,\" Lucy, the youngest of the lot, hides in an old wardrobe only to suddenly discover that she is not in the wardrobe, but a magical snow covered land as well. After visiting with dear fawn, Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy), she soon returns back to her siblings with a seemingly tall tale a grand adventure of a great land in need of rescue from the hand of an evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton).Although the other Pevensie children find Lucy's tale amusing, they hardly choose to believer her. One day Edmond too stumbles into the magical land of Narnia, only to fall prey to the wiles of the evil White Witch who feeds his selfish desires, but he too quickly returns home to his siblings. Finally, all four children are thrust together into a grand adventure through the wardrobe where they must not only fight for each other and save Edmond from the White Witch's schemes, but join the in the fight along with their talking animal friends in hopes of saving Narnia. The soon begin looking to the great Savior of Narnia, Aslan (Liam Neeson), the \"Great Lion\" and only one who can ever hope to truly save the land of Narnia from the evil schemes of the White Witch.Intrigue, suspense, and adventure, this wonderful film depicts excellent cinematography that is sure to delight viewers young and old. Released theaters in 2005 and in DVD format in 2006, this movie quickly became a smashing worldwide hit through its top of the line mix of real actors and computer generation. Vividly real in its color and detail, the film seemingly draws the viewer into the story, and leaves them wishing they too could stumble into such delightful fairy worlds. Depicting child actors as its main characters, these youngsters do an excellent job carrying the starring roles through a perfect mixture of their own personalities that seem to genuinely fit so well with that of their roles. The only character who could possibly use a bit of improvement is that of the White Witch, who although plays her role in an excellent dramatic fashion, could have been portrayed a bit better with costumes and props that might have \"fit\" more with her harsh and horrid, evil role.Fitting with the \"family friendly\" style of the film, this movie depicts a suspenseful river crossing and climatic \"bloodless\" battle of the good Narnians against the evil White Witch and her minions in a classic battle of good versus evil, in a dramatic, yet tasteful fashion which leaves the suspense, but takes away the ugly goriness of  real life battles. The great wild, yet good Lion, Aslan must also play the key role in this tale of not only being the \"savior\" of Narnia, but one who is even willing to even give his life in the place of an undeserving traitor, while his role provides a clear parallel to another \"Great Savior\" as well.Quickly becoming one of my personal favorite movies, I would highly recommend this film to viewers of all ages who would enjoy an adventurous touching tale of a land where children can save the world, a great Savior pays the final price, and good always triumphs in the end. Astounding cinematography, a delightful soundtrack, thrilling effects, and wonderful acting, this movie certainly leaves viewers of all ages well pleased and wishing for more, or at least hoping to discover their own fairy land in the depths their own wardrobes.\n",
      "Well, I had read just one of these books. I can't really say that I hated it because then I'd be lying, but I definetely wouldn't call the media for such a great movie. But some of the actors are kinda hot ;-)\n",

      "I started by plugging this movie with my youth group at church but not really knowing what to expect since I have never read the books and only had seen the old animated feature. I was told though through elders at the church and the kids that are in my youth group that this was truly a work of literature that was God inspired. Now saying that Im not saying that God came down and told C.S. Lewis what to write but that the Truth of the Bible inspired Mr. Lewis to capture the life-changing events that he had found in Scripture. What I found in the 2 times (soon to be 3) that I viewed this movie just how much the joy of a relationship with God and His love was revealed! There are many scenes that will just go by the waste side as \"just part of the movie\", but in fact are superb referances to the Bible. The main characters in this movie for me were not only the children but more so the Lion(Aslan) and the Witch(Jadis). In biblical referance, these two characters were representations of Jesus Christ and Satan. In a few scenes that stand out for me the most we see Jadis conversing with Edmund, one of the sons of Adam. Jadis came across as the self procalimed Queen of Narnia but in fact was the White Witch. Biblical referance refers to Satan as the lord of this world when in fact he is no more then a deciever. The most interesting part of this scene though is that Jadis promises Edmund the thing that he most desires at that moment, other then being taller, and she complies to give him a sample of his wish. She asks him to deliver his brother and sisters and she will give him a room full of the \"sweeties\" and make him king of Narnia. But Edmund could not deliver what it was that she asked but instead revealed to Jadis where they were and what was being carried out. Edmund feeling that he had fufilled Jadis's request asked her for a taste of his desire. She rewarded him by locking him in chains and feeding him stale bread/muffin and frozen solid drink. How often when Satan promises us our hearts desires that we carry out unknowningly his requests and our reward is no more then losing our innocence as Edmund had. Some of the scenes that featured Aslan showed how Jesus entered into this world. He entered not as a dictator to overthrow the Law(Prophecy) but to usher in the fufillment of the Law(Prophecy). In this Asaln did not raise a hand to the Witch until after he was sacrificied (crucified). Aslan entered as Jesus entered, a Prince of Peace who overcame death by His sacrifice and rose again. As the Bible states that He will return as a Conqueror to overthrow Satans reign in this world. In this movie this is portrayed as Aslan being slain, resurrected and overthrows Jadis's reign. There are so many more referances to the Bible in this movie that I cannot take the time to feature them in this review but encourage you to view this movie for the first time (or second) with the state of mind, heart and spirit that there is a story here that is eternally victorious then just the movie itself.\n",
      "enjoyable movie. kids really enjoyed it. awakens the imagination. would recommend. my kids are now interested in the series. i will probably look into getting the book now too.\n",
      "This review is for the THEATRICAL VERSION, not the not-yet-released DVD in any form.  When I have procured the Special Edition, I will then review that format/version.I must say that I was more than a bit apprehensive concerning My viewing of this film. I was as hesitant to see this as any bible-thumping fire and brimstone mom would be to see a Harry Potter movie, and for the same reasons...I didn't want Me and Mine subjected to religious beliefs to which we do not subscribe. It is for that reason that I refuse to see/own/borrow \"The Passion of the Christ\" or otherwise view it in any capacity.I had no idea what to expect. I frankly could not remember the story to save My life. I had to go online and read the Cliff Notes to remember the damned thing at ALL. I do remember that I had just completed a heinous wading through \"Pilgrim's Progress\" at the time [I was living with nuns then...OY!] and was about as thrilled about reading the LW&W; as I was over a visit to our sadistically twisted monk/dentist. Before that, I honestly had no memory of the work.Now that I've read the Notes and refreshed My memory, I can say that I do remember the story quite well. It was incredibly similar to Tolkien's works, which I would read in their entirety some 18 years later, making the connection only then.I must say the beginning of this endeavor brought the Lemony Snicket series immediately to mind. I do realize, of course, that the SoUE was written much later than the CoN; however, the casting choices for the parts of the children is more to what I refer. Naturally, there are four children here in the LW&W;, where in SoUE there were three, but I think anyone could see the similarities quite easily. Indeed, in the opening moments of LW&W;, I more than half expected to hear Jude Law's voice smoothing through the speakers to caution us that this would not be a happy tale.Many reviewers have [at this point] been quick to extoll the striking similarites between the LW&W; and the LotR, while others were more keen to demonstrate [ad nauseum, I might add] each detail of Christian symbolism Lewis found appropriately necessary to insert throughout his works, so I won't bore you with loads of those details. I have to point out a few, but that's only because the story is built around Christian myth and Tolkien's stolen ideas [alleged by Tolkien himself, not by this reviewer].I will, instead, attempt a different route and see where it leads us.*The introduction to our principal characters was an emotional one, setting up a small bit of character development, allowing you to \"know\" them as well as a few minutes' insight into their lives will allow.*Edmond is the petulant one, Pete[r] is the responsible \"daddy-like\" older brother.*Susan is \"just trying to be smart,\" and Lucy's duty to the cast is to be adorable; a task which she performs beautifully, I might add.The comparison to the Baudelaire children is astounding.*Susan is darker haired, pouty-lipped, wannabe braniac very much like Violet. The physical and characterizational similarities are astounding.*Both Edmond and Pete[r] serve to give us Klaus.*The two characters combine to constitute the depth of character given us by Liam Aiken which says a great deal about the quality of his acting abilities.*And Lucy takes the place of the cutesykins, Sunny. Of course, Lucy is a bit older and therfore offers us a tad bit more than cute expressions, meaningless gurgles, and \"offered meanings\" to her indiscriminate noises.*Their lives begin with startling parallel to the Baudelaires, in that their parents are absent from their lives, and they are sent to live with strangers.From there, the only resemblance to the cinematic SoUE work is the personalities of the characters, themselves. To illustrate that, I'll point out the striking similarities between Count Olaf and the White Witch [portrayed brilliantly by Tilda Swinton who also was more than adequate in her role as the Archangel Gabriel in Constantine].*Both are over the top.*Both are willing to go to any means to achieve their self-serving ends.It is My opinion that children and some adult] \"actors\" don't usually act. They remember their lines, and they pretend to be someone they're not, but acting is more than remembering lines. Acting is being your character, not just spouting thoughts and ideals which are not your own. An actor possesses the ability to make someone who is watching, believe that you are who you're pretending to be, to believe what you're saying.As far as the Tolkien references/rip-offs/similarities, there are simply too many to mention. It is My understanding that Tolkien and Lewis were both members of a literary club [known as the \"Inklings\"] at Oxford during which time Tolkien would share the early drafts of his novels with the other members of the group. He claimed early on that Lewis was stealing his ideas, causing him to rewrite his drafts, and thereby forcing him to \"best\" his own works. So, if Tolkien was correct in his accusations, we have Lewis to thank for the beautiful works which are the Lord of the Rings. Tolkien and Lewis remained bitter enemies until Lewis's death in '65, and indeed, Tolkien still bore him a grudge until his own death in 1973. Some references state that they were friends and that's not entirely untrue. They were friends until Tolkien began to recognize his own words and ideas within Lewis's writings [according to Tolkien].Again, the similarities are many, but to name a few...* the entrance to Mr. Tumnus's lair looks remarkably similar to the entrance to Bagg's End* the archtypical fiend was the \"White Witch,\" whereas the LotR bears Saruman the White* beloved Gandalf sacrifices himself to save his friends [namesly Frodo] and dies at the hand of Magick used darkly and is \"reborn\" even more powerful because he was not dark, himself...just as Aslan dies at the hands of those who use Magick darkly, and is reborn through the means of a Magickal sacred stone altar which will crack and negate a sacrifice made erroneously [Aslan gave his life in Edmond's stead so Aslan was not the traitor, but was sacrificed as one which activated the spell on the sacred stone]* the battle scene build-up was very reminiscent of the larger, more involved Lord of the Rings battles [Helm's Deep especially], but not nearly as well done* the gryphons served the part of the Elves in that they were airbourne in their assault [shredding beaks and rending talons rather than archer's arrows, but in the air none the less]* ents* the maps were extremely Tolkien* Aslan returns from the grave like Gandalf, and for the same reason [the Laws of Magick]* the traveling party all received gifts from Santa Claus [also known as King of Elves]* right after Mr. Tumnus is released, the shot of the troups marching across the rock bridge atop the mountains looked like it was straight out of LotR! Call it \"homage\" if you will, but to Me, that was blatant...Now, I realize these Tolkien similarities [and there are more...many more] also involve the filming, direction, casting choices, location choices, DoP's choice of angles, etc. rather than what Tolkien and/or Lewis has written, hence My hesitation to sit here and go over any more of them. Those listed above are among the most obvious and blatant examples. There are more, to be sure.As far as the Christian symbolism contained within, there was surprisingly little. Below, I've detailed the most glaring instances.* the lion, Aslan, who returns from the dead [but c'mon! Gandalf returned from the dead and no one made the Christian connection with that!]* Aslan the Lion King was intended to represent Christ* the coat of arms on Narnia's shields and breastplates was reminiscent of Richard the LionHearted and those used during the Holy Crusades* they [the people of Narnia] refer to the children as \"Sons of Adam, Daughters of Eve\"Those are about it. I realize there were more, but those are so subtle that no one BUT a religious zealot would care to notice.Now, for My \"different route.\"* it strikes Me as more than a bit odd that a Lion King would be chosen as a representative of christ by Lewis when it was the very lions to whom the xtians were fed! He was much more closely associated with the King of the Island of Misfit Toys, if you ask me...* the Dogwood tree [beloved by xtians for symbolism only they read into it] was formerly used to grant wishes and bring protection to the home. It is the first tree flower to bloom in the Springtime, and although the Christians claim that is one of the xtian connections and CS Lewis was a Christian author, I still hesitate to give them that. I find its use more Pagan than Christian.* I considered the White Witch's alignment [that of Evil] to be a direct insult to all \"white\" witches. Christians are of the opinion that a witch is a witch, but if you've studied Paganism to ANY extent, you know that's just not the case. However, the usage here is quite obvious.* I also considered the White Witch to be the anti-thesis to Santa Claus. She rides in a belled sleigh drawn by white reindeer. She takes, rather than gives, and she is cruel down to her bones.* regardless of the Christian dogma throughout this work, it completely fails to achieve any hidden Christian agenda and uplifts that which it would condemn. Disney is great at that. LOL* Santa appears as the Holly King to bestow gifts upon the children which will help them in their tasks. This Santa is also on the side of Aslan, which could parallel the priesthood of Catholics and Druids who worked side by side for generations before the Druid tolerance of the Christians was used against them to force them out all together.All in all, I found this movie more Pagan through its use of Nature and Sympathetic Magicks than Christian. Aslan did rise from the dead, but due to a Law of High Magick, rather than \"divine intervention,\" thereby negating the xtian undertones completely.Honestly? I loved it. It was wonderful. It was the children's version of the Lord of the Rings saga.Unfortunately the costumes appear to have only just been made. They did not take the time and expense of \"aging\" the costumes, thereby lending an almost 80's television feel to this otherwise epic production. Everyone looked [most of the time] as if they just stepped out of the makeup trailer, which did nothing to dispell the 80's television feeling.The CGI was decent, but Aslan was not as well done as he should have been, considering the staggering budget this movie was awarded, the quality of actors and talent they had associated with this thing, and the name \"Disney.\" I always expect the very best from Disney. I am often disappointed. The CGI in no way failed. It just was not what it should have been.This one nearly lived up to its potential. At any rate, I found \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" to be highly entertaining, heart-warming, and endearing.It rates an 8.5/10.\n",
      "I went in not expecting much, and was amazed with how good this movie is.  The actors that played Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy were perfectly cast.  The visuals were wonderful, and the animals and CGI and everything was great.  You feel that Narnia is real and you're there as you watch.  I am telling you, this is a wonderful movie, see it soon.\n",
      "Great series. I loved the books as a child and now love watching them come to life on the screen.\n",
      "After a horrid BBC adaptation of C.S. Lewis'The Chronicles of Narnia, Disney'sThe Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobedoes a decent job of bringing the first book to life. The Pevensie kids were generally well cast, and Georgie Henley as young Lucy steals the show. James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus is also very good. The film provides a visual feast, from snowy mountains to fauns and minotaurs.  Harry Gregson-Williams' moving soundtrack provides an epic backdrop for the action.Unfortunately, as much as I like it, I just felt like I couldn't giveThe Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobefive stars. Coming so soon after the Lord of the Rings trilogy,The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobeobviously invites comparisons. However, Disney just doesn't meet the high standards those films set. For one thing, some of the roles are miscast. William Moseley as Peter never shows much passion. Tilda Swinton as the evil queen never really worked for me, although she has some moments (such as riding in a sleigh pulled by polar bears). Some of the animal computer-generated characters look cartoonish, especially the wolves, although Aslan the lion himself looks great. Overall, these are a few details that, with a bit more work, could have been improved.I think it's fair to say thatThe Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobewill be remembered as a well-done, entertaining movie adaptation, but not an outstanding work of art along the lines of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings. The film is fun, entertaining, and likely to please fans of Lewis' novels, but, with a bit more time and effort, could have been even better. Ultimately, I don't think Disney and director Andrew Adamson were a right fit for the series, which makes it good news that the next films (The Voyage of the Dawn Treader) will be in good hands.\n",
      "I saw it years ago and didn't notice how great it was until I saw it again now! The story is great and the message even better. This is one of my few favorite movies.\n",
      "It has been years since I have read C.S Lewis' \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\". Now that I have finally seen the film, it is time for me to pull out my dusty paperback novel and read it again. Since I haven't read the book in ages, I can't really compare the film with the novel. Like most books turned into films (i.e \"Memoirs of a Geisha\"), I am sure there was some alterations in the film adaptation.The film centers around four siblings: Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy Pevenise. The four are sent to the countryside to live with a mysterious professor because of the heavy bombing that is occuring in London during WWII. During a game of hide and seek, Lucy discovers a cabinet which leads to another world called Narnia. At first her older siblings do not believe her but eventually they do when she takes them to Narnia. It is revealed that there is a prophesy that two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve would one day come to Narnia and help vanquish the White Witch.Although I am not of particular faith, I was not bothered by the Christian references in the film. I went into this movie with the idea that this was purely entertainment, and entertained I was. I enjoyed the internal conflicts Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy had to endure before the climatic battle. I personally liked Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan. He spoke as if he was as old and wise as Aslan. Every actor in the film was spot on.I loved the costumes and the CGI effects. The two disc special edition is a real treat. It is packed with goodies like bloopers, commentary from the director, anatomy of a scene, and other behind the scenes look at the film and actors. Disney definitely did a good job at packaging \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\". Good movie, good bonus features. Well worth the money.\n",
      "My review portion will be short. The special affects are fantastic! It's a great movie, although there are some variations from the book, to be sure. I think I still like the \"feel\" of the animated version from years ago a little better. But this version is excellent in its own right.My main reason for posting is this: My daughter and I are watching the DVD version now, and are just about thru it. My memory isn't quite as good as her's, but she has pointed out that she remembers quite a few scenes in the \"theater\" version that seem to be changed in the \"DVD\" version. 2 examples she has pointed out have been #1 - when Edmund gets thrown in the prison cell there are a couple little lines missing, and #2 - when Peter kills the wolf, she says that scene has been slightly edited as well.So, I guess I'm wondering if the DVD has really been altered, or is she is remembering incorrectly?  :)If the DVD HAS been altered, then take this as a warning to wait for the \"Unedited\" DVD version to come out down the road.\n",
      "We bought the special two-disc edition of this movie, hoping that it would be worth the extra cash.  It was!Like many others here, I grew up with a love for Narnia.  In fact, \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" inspired me to become a novelist myself.  I wanted to pass on the same joy that Lewis gave me.  After the success of \"The Lord of the Rings\" movies, I had cautious anticipation for the release of this Narnia film.  Would they get it right?  Would they capture the magic?  Would Aslan and the White Witch seem real?The answer is: Yes!  I sat in the theater, judging every scene, every element.  As the titles rolled, I let out a sigh of relief.  Then, going back to see it again, I was able to enjoy it fully.  No more worries.  Pure childlike escape.  The four children are so beautifully cast for this film; the White Witch is acted and costumed to perfection; and Aslan seems kind and benevolent, while still maintaining a regal air.  I knew the animals would come to life in Narnia when I saw the first scenes with Mr. and Mrs. Beaver.  I loved the humor thrown in.Sure, there are a few things that deviate from the book.  No, I was never a fan of the Father Christmas scene.  Admittedly, the fox in the movie never seems real to me.  But those are small concerns in the big picture.  The overall magic is there.  And in the collector's edition, you can see behind-the-scenes in wonderful ways.  If you ask me, I think Lewis would be pleased.\n",
      "If you don't know the story, its about 2 brothers and their 2 sisters who are sent out to the country to live with a distant relative. With nothing to do the kids play hide & seek, in which the youngest discovers a wardrobe to hide in. The wardrobe isn't just any old place to hang coats but is actually a doorway to an enchanted world.Brining such a classic to the big screen is a huge undertaking, just as Peter's Jacksons' attempt at Lord of the Rings. Critics are in any case going to abound as one attempts to translate such a well loved series of books to a new media format. Does the translation happen well?I'd have to say, \"Yes\".Some suspense is lost in some scenes as they are cut short to save film time (such as Edmunds flight from the beaver's house), but overall the main points are carried well to the screen and with good direction and special effects. The style of movie is very much like Jackson's Lord of the Rings though not quite as dark and ghastly even though this movie deserves the PG rating as it may be too much for some young kids.The movie leaves the childish telling of the book for a more mature, action feel and for an adult it is well received. My kids love the animials and creatures (minataurs and centaurs) and how some were inherently on the side of good and some on the side of evil.The acting was well done even by the youngest star of the show.The direction was well handled and gave me enough eye candy that I loved some of the cinematography of the show. I thank God that the director didn't try the old MTV, shaky camera technique to give the feel of movement and fighting.The sound and editing were great and I felt the thunder of hoofs as the two armies charged each other.You never see any blood in the movie and even the scene with Aslan on the stone table is handled well as I was first concerned the director may make it too gruesome for my young kids.I was left with a feeling that more was to come as if this movie is the intro to something bigger (in some sense it is considering this is the first of 7 books), but I was also happily satisfied in the end.NOTE: when the credits start don't stop watching, they throw a little something more about a 30-60sec into the credits to close out the story. By then half the people had already walked out of the theater and missed it.Overall, I'd feel this was appropriate for ages 8+ (considering our cultural exposure to content nowadays) and it is enjoyable for adults too.If you haven't read the book do that first though. Its a fun little read.\n",
      "The item looked perfect.  I never received the chance to watch the DVD because it was given as a gift.  I assume that everything was fine with it, though, since I have not heard any complaints.\n",
      "C.S. Lewis Fans Our Film has finally arrived in full color with excellent speciall effects that can only be dwarfed by your imagination. This fill Stays true to the book series and looses nothing to the speciall effects when it comes to plot and story line. Excellent Family film and those that fell in love with the CS Lewis Books be perpaired to fall in love again.\n",
      "a dvd too add to you collection great fun for all too see, a movie too set down with the whole family and see over and over again. a movie you must buy. tks\n",
      "My friend had a copy of this dvd, and I had to borrow it. For a long time I lost it. I gave her copy back, and bought my own. I love the art that's included in it, and I love the movie. My baby loves the music in it, I think I'll buy the soundtrack soon. If you love classic books, C.S. Lewis, Narnia, or anything like that, then you'll love this. It's such a cute collector piece, it fits in with the 'Magic of Narnia'.\n",
      "after so many year,i guest the first narnia is like a dream, when them was enter to the wardrop for a lont time till them adult. in the once time when them went traveler to tracking the horse, them see the lamppost. and then them say that them familiar see that lamppost, them remember about the spare room. and then them enter to the hole, them return become a child.\n",
      "We really appreciate the Chronicles of Narnia being made into such an outstanding Movie -- literally, the first truly family movie, in awhile, that centers on character in many diverse situations (excluding Veggie Tales -- only because of being animation, and somewhat limited - in appeal to older kids).  And the multifaceted consequences of your choices; the importance of using Biblical Values for the foundation of your choices.  While doing it all with great kid actors, lots of action, great cinematography, plus great special effects.In fact, the Chronicles of Narnia, are the first books that my son is really getting into (I have a confession - I am thoroughly enjoying them also), and WANTS to read all seven!  Plus, these books open up many discussions between us.Think about this, how/why can any decent person, of honest conscience, and a good heart EVER have a problem with Biblical Values which result in the best kids, WITH good manners, hope, and faith in the future, and in something bigger, and better than themselves, that (God) promises to help them through anything in their lives, if they get to know/trust in him, and pursue HIS way of doing and being right -- no matter what seems/appears right in today's society, or feels good to you at the time.  For example; today's kid/teen movies teach it is cool to get revenge, or that is extremely important to have a \"hot\" girl/guy like you and have sex or you are really \"weird.\"\n",
      "I was very happy with the movie and the speedy service.  The movie came quickly and I enjoyed watching it.\n",
      "Again Disney us a sorceress brings history adapted of one classic of the literature. Exelente dramatizations, magnificent special effects, movie that it(he,she) invites us as the former movies to dream. The typical fight between(among) the good and evil always they will be present and this one is not the eception.Nuevamente Disney nos trae una magica historia adaptada de uno clasicos de la literatura. Exelente dramatizaciones, magnificos efectos especiales, pelicula que nos invita como las antiguas peliculas a soñar. La tipica lucha entre el bien y mal siempre estarán presentes y esta no es la ecepción.\n",
      "\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" is spellbinding, a beautifully-realized adaptation of C.S. Lewis's classic fantasy yarn. It has endless appeal: fantasy lovers will eat it up, those who view the Narnia books as a religious parable will not be disappointed, and families who were afraid to take their children to \"Lord of the Rings\" will be relieved to know that \"TLtWatW\" is less bloody and more intimate, although it has plenty of action and excitement. It works on every level.The film opens in the middle of the London Blitz, as a mother and her four children cower in a bunker while bombs rain down. The scene seems out of place at first, but it serves to strengthen the fears and emotions of the main characters while providing a counterpoint to later scenes. Soon the four Pevensie kids -- stalwart Peter (William Moseley), practical Susan (Anna Popplewell), brooding Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and plucky Lucy (Georgie Henley) -- are shipped off to the quiet country estate of an elderly professor (a twinkle-eyed Jim Broadbent). It is there, during a game of hide-and-seek, that Lucy finds a dusty spare room and a towering, ornate wardrobe. A perfect hiding place, she thinks, but the wardrobe seems much bigger on the inside, and then her hand brushes a snow-covered pine branch...Narnia is a sweeping world of hills and forests, cloaked (at first) in swirling snow. Lucy meets a friendly satyr named Tumnus (James McAvoy) who explains that the land is ruled by Jadis, the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), who has made it \"always winter, and never Christmas.\" Back on Earth, Lucy's siblings don't believe her story, but soon Edmund finds his way into Narnia -- where he is beguiled by the White Witch -- and Peter and Susan follow. They promptly find themselves number one on the Witch's hit list, thanks to an ancient prophecy foretelling that four young humans will end the times of evil. All of Narnia's animals are also people, as the Pevensies discover when they are helped out by a charming beaver couple (voiced by Ray Winstone and Dawn French) and a clever red fox (Rupert Everett), and narrowly escape from a snarling wolf pack that is also the Witch's police force.Yes, war is coming to Narnia, and the forces of good -- centaurs, fauns, gryphons, and the like -- are rallying under the command of the legendary lion Aslan (benevolently voiced by Liam Neeson). The Witch has her own army of imps, minotaurs, cyclopses, werewolves, and other nasties, and she's also tricked Edmund into betraying his siblings. It seems that Peter, Susan, and Lucy are fated to lead the battle. They are horrified at first, and the film nicely underlines their unhappiness at finding themselves in greater danger than before. \"Mother sent us here to get us AWAY from war!\" Susan protests, but fate is fate, and when Saint Nicholas himself turns up to bestow weapons on the Pevensies, they are forced to admit that they can't leave, not now. As for the religious parable -- for those of you who don't know the story -- I will only say that Aslan stands in for Jesus Christ, and Edmund is the sinner redeemed. As a nondenominational person, I like the fact that the film neither ignores the Christian undertones nor emphasizes them. The viewer is left to decide.The special effects by Weta Workshop are superb, a skillful combination of prosthetics, animatronics, and CGI. Weta also did the LOTR trilogy, and based on those films and this one, I'd say there's nothing they can't do. I was especially impressed by the animals, who are always realistic and never \"cute,\" but still provide some comic relief (a talking horse named Phillip gets the biggest laugh in the movie). Indeed, the screenplay sneaks in some decent, PG-rated one-liners (\"Just because a man in a red suit put a sword in your hands does NOT make you a hero!\" Susan snaps at Peter), and the four young actors do a fine job of carrying the film from danger and sadness to wonder and joy. The White Witch has always been a very one-dimensional character, but Swinton, with her ghostly beauty and icy gaze, avoids teeth-gnashing hamminess and plays Jadis as a primal, implacable force of evil. There is not a shred of humanity in this woman (if she is a woman), whether she's tempting Edmund with magical sweets or turning good guys to stone with her wand. That's as it should be. I was annoyed at the movie for encouraging the stereotype that wolves are evil, but what can you do? It's in the book. Actually, almost everything in the book makes it into the movie, and there's even room for some extra action scenes, the most effective of which involves a melting waterfall. \"TLtWatW\" is probably the most faithful book-to-movie adaptation since \"Holes,\" so Lewis purists won't be let down. Yes, the final battle is more epic and violent than Lewis would have wished, as gryphons drop boulders on screaming goblins, a phoenix sets the battle plain on fire, and Peter hacks and slashes his way to a one-on-one duel with the Witch. But I've resigned myself to the fact that certain Hollywood-friendly adjustments must always be made, and so I was able to enjoy the climax for its own sake.Director Andrew Adamson, best known for the \"Shrek\" films, shows that he is not limited to animation. \"TLtWatW\" is a worthy, entertaining film, and with any luck, it will inspire a new franchise. There are seven books in the Narnia series, after all. Who knows what wonders may come?\n",
      "I think this is a fantastic film, the kids acting is natural and not forced at all unlikethe first two Harry Potter films.Narnia: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is a wonderful film as are the sequels, I currently own the DVD version Extended Cut which I think is superior to the Theatrical Editionbecause the battle scenes at the end are now appropriate in length whereas I thought they seemed shortened in the cinema. My only question is should I commit to buy the Blu-Ray or wait for the Extended Cut to be released?Is the time posted here on Amazon right for the Blu-Ray or a misprint? Amazon says that the Blu-Ray is 143 mins long, is that correct or a misprint?Does anyone know if the the Blu-Ray version is the Extended Cut or not?Thanks.\n",
      "The movie is magic.  The most magical moment for me was the entire scene starting when Lucy steps back into the snow and discovers Narnia to when she awakens and the fawn helps her return to the lamp post.About the only thing that I didn't like was Liam Neeson's voice as Aslan.  It was too recognizable.  Everytime Aslan would talk, it would jolt me right out of the movie to visions of Liam Neeson.  He's a great actor, and I've enjoyed his films, but for me his voice didn't work for Aslan.Edmond is truly easy to hate.  They never redeem him fully.  The battle scene was oddly disjointed from the rest of the story.  Like it didn't fit, or was too Return-of-the-King-ish.  The movie really could have stood on its own with the magic and adventure, it didn't need a battle scene.  What were they trying to make it?  Like Bedknobs & Broomsticks?  Disney, <sigh>.\n",
      "I absolutely LOVED this movie!!!!!!  I have read the book and loved it as a child and love the movie too.  I have read other reviews who complain its not the book, but nothing will ever compare to one's imagination.  And as far as the changes from book to screen: there will always be changes when you turn a book into a movie as well as someone elses' interpretation of it.  But I thought it was excellent and have watched it over and over.  I thought the cast of the children (Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley, & Anna Popplewell)  and Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy) were unbelievably exceptional in this movie.  I am of course a fan of James McAvoy but I really hope and can't wait to see more of Georgie Henley.  I don't know what it is about her but she is brilliant!\n",
      "From the Chronicles of Narnia comes \"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\".  This first in the series gets the reader, in this case viewer, into the world of Narnia. Produced by Disney and Walden Media, this movie version is the best rendition yet of LWW.  There  have been others but not this well produced and acted.  Purist may take issues with the movie vs the book but this is just splitting hairs.  This is a good movie well worth adding to any collection.  Here's hoping they continue the series and produce all seven novels into movies.  I tell my kids that after watching the movie they need to read the book as well.  To often in this media world, the movie gets watched more than the book gets read..and this series deserves to be read.Here's hoping that all the young in heart keep checking the back of wardrobes and watching for lamps in forests.\n",
      "We needed to watch a bit of this movie to get an idea of the characters in it and choose one scene because my son had to make a panorama for school and this movie worked out well for helping us.\n",
      "These discs are without a doubt one of the best gifts I received this Christmas.At least every other week we watch this fine example of good vs evil.Living in the turbulent times we do,it's nice to escape into a world were you don't have to worry who will win.\n",
      "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is a charming and entertaining movie that, in the Disney tradition, works well as a family movie that entertains both parents and older children. (I would not say it is good for younger children.)Based on the classic series, it focuses on 4 siblings who are transported to another magical world where creaures such as centaurs and a royal speaking lion abound.The story is well done, and you find yourself caring for the charactors, even the one brother who can be a bit of a pain, the Lion and Lucy, one of the siblings who is wonderful.It is not the dark intensity of the Lord of The Rings or the similarily dark Harry Potter movies (which I also enjoyed), nor does it extend to the same level of special effects as either of those series, but stands on its own as seperate in the same general theme of magic.\n",
      "This is a wonderful film for the entire family.  The effects are staggering, and the story is faithful to the original story - The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.Two sons of Adam and two daughters of EveC.S. Lewis was a great storyteller and a great theologian.  He was able to weave together elements from fairly orthodox Christian belief into metaphoric stories that show a classic battle between good and evil in ways that transcend the purely Christian context.  Elements such as the innocence and wonderment expressed by children, the power of nature and natural elements, the struggle between good and bad - these are things that have been shown in mythological and cultural stories from the most ancient of times up to the modern day television serials.  They are brought to a strong pitch here in this film, hopefully the first of several installments of the rest of the Chronicles of Narnia.One needn't be Christian to enjoy these tales, nor must one subscribe to any particular theology to find them accessible - this really isn't evangelism as it is known via 'televangelism' today.The director Andrew Adamson and writers Ann Peacock,Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely worked with the estate of C.S. Lewis to strive to remain faithful to Lewis' original vision in terms of story and characters, but also to allow for the developments of technological expression that permit fuller visualisation than Lewis could give.  This also occurs in the acting - the four leading roles of children are played by relative newcomers:  Georgie Henley plays Lucy, Skandar Keynes plays Edmund, William Moseley plays Peter, and Anna Popplewell plays Susan - the four Pevensie children exiled from London during the war, thrust into an austere and severe household in the country that is full of real-life mystery apart from the wardrobe that holds the portal to Narnia.  The film is very faithful to the spirit of Lewis' work, as well as much of the detail of the stories.  This makes this a good companion to encourage reading.Narnia is presented not as a fantasy or dream (a la Peter Pan or Wizard of Oz), but rather as a real place; comparisons will be made with the Lord of the Rings trilogy in  many respects (including the incredible scenery from New Zealand mountainous regions), but one primary difference here is that the connection to the real world here is very real indeed.  The White Witch, portrayed by Tilda Swinton, is played in a very realistic way - she represents what children fear the most, not as much bloody violence and evil as much as a cold detachment and lack of caring and compassion (something that children in all eras find frightening).  Just as the place is real, the children are real, and the situations in the real world are just as harrowing as those in Narnia.  However, in Narnia (unlike the real world) it is the children who have the real power.The CGI effects are astounding, but the voices bring the real life to the characters.  Actors such as Liam Neeson (Aslan), Rupert Everett (Fox) and Dawn French (Mrs. Beaver) add their unique personalities to the characterisations of the animal roles.  Things are done in a truly wonderful way.This is a film for all ages, and all sorts of people who love a good story.\n",
      "We ordered this as a gift and also ordered a box of Turkish Delights to go along with it.  Made for a fun treat to go with a great movie!\n",
      "To tell you the truth I became a fan of this movie after interviewing Anna and William here in Mexico, this version of the movie I find more interesting than the regular one because there are so many more details that people that like looking close to details will completely enjoy.Other than that the extra features are amazing for people who are either curious or like me that work or study in things to do with movies, its completely amazing.I just dont know what else to say other that i loved it\n",
      "I recommend this to all age groups!  This is a fantastic film.  It has everything!  GO SEE IT!\n",
      "Four children-Peter (William Mosley ), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes)and Lucy (Georgie Henley) , are sent into the country , from London, during World War II , because of air raids.They are sent to the house of an old Professor , in the heart of the country.There the youngest , Lucy comes across an old wardrobe , and stumbles through it into the Land of Narnia , who she meets Mr Tumnus (James McAvoy) , a faun.Later Edmund also go's through the wardrobe into Narnia , where he meets the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), who lures him into her service , with magic Turkish Delight.Later all of the children are swept into the adventure where the White Witch , who rules with an iron fist over Narnia , tries to prevent the prophecy whereby the lion Aslan (Liam Neeson) , will free Narnia and change the eternal winter (where Christmas is not allowed) into the enchanted land which it once was.This is a glorious film version the book. Each of the cast are perfect for their roles.There are some outstanding scenes - such as the frightening scene where Aslan is sacrificed by the White Witch and her evil cohorts (hags , minotaurs , red and black dwarfs , trolls and goblins just to name a few of the sinister minions of the White Witch), and the battle scene near the end where Aslan's army (which include centaurs , gryphons and leopards), led by Peter , faces the White Witches forces (which include tigers).New characters and dimensions are introduced in he movie ,  unlike the Lord of the Rings movie (where characters and scenes out of neccesity had to be cut out-due to the length of the book) and it fits the picture perfectly.Characters introduced just for the film include the Fox (read by Rupert Everett) and General Oreius (Patrick Kake). Tilda Swinton is  coldly  diabolical and chilling, as the White Witch. Kiran Shah comes puts across pure spite as  the sadistic dwarf Ginnabrik .And William Mosley , Anna Popplewell and Skandar Keynes fit the roles of Peter , Susan and Edmund perfectly.But it is Georgie Henley as the absolutely adorable Lucy who is the undoubted star of the show.This colurful and stunning epic is a testament to the struggle between good , reperesenting Judeo-Christian civilization , and the evil forces of terror and tyranny, which can only be fought and defeated.There can be no compromises or negotiation with terror.\n",
      "Fantasy, adventure, intrigue and triumph.  What more could be said of this classic. Great special effects and good acting talents bring this story to life like no other version.\n",
      "There's been quite a few adaptions of C.S. Lewis' book \"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\" made. There was a cartoon movie, there was a British TV serial, and now there is a big budget movie, the first in a series of Narnia films. I was very excited when I heard they were doing this, since I'm a very big C.S. Lewis fan. Apart from a couple of very minor hiccups, it was a very fine film indeed.Due to the War the four Pensevie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are sent into the country, where they will be looked after by Professor Kirke. Kirke lives in a rather large house, so there's plenty of places for hide and seek. During on of their games, little Lucy stumbles upon a world within a wardrobe, a world full of talking animals, fauns, nymphs, dwarves and driads, a world where it is always winter and never Christmas thanks to a White Witch named Jadis. Under her reign, Narnia is miserable and oppressed, but there are rumours among the talking animals that Aslan the lion, Narnia's true king, is on the move and that a prophecy is due to be fulfilled.First of all, I've got to say that I'm glad the producers started the series with \"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\" rather than \"The Magician's Nephew\", which as a book worked better as a prequel than as an introduction to Narnia. There's been a lot of fantasies based on books lately, so I'm sure there have been a lot of comparisons to the \"Harry Potter\" and \"Lord of the Rings\" film franchises. I've seen most of both of those film series, and I personally like this Narnia film just a bit better than both of them. The plot is fuller and better flowing than the \"Harry Potter\" films (which I'd be totally lost on without the books, and much more fun and colourful than the \"Lord of the Rings\".The kids are well cast, they look as I'd imagined them to in the books, more or less. They also look like they care about each other very much, which really helps the emotion and family side of the messages in the film. The White Witch is also played very well. Just like Edmund, you could mistake her for a motherly figure to begin with, but just watch the emptiness in her eyes. Brilliant! The effects are you're typical 2000s blend of computer graphics, prosthetics and blue screen, but they do the job well enough.J.R.R. Tolkien, though a good friend of C.S. Lewis', was never a big fan of the Narnia series. He just couldn't get his head around the fact that all these elements of various mythologies and cultures (fauns, dryads, Father Christmas, etc) were sharing the same imaginary place. Though I think Tolkien was being a little obsessive there (they're just imaginary creatures, J.), he does have a little bit of a point. It must have been a task for the design team of the film to have everything gel together, but they manage to succeed I thought. Narnia's Father Christmas, for instance, is no Santa stereotype in the film. He wears a subdued red-brown suit, is fairly trim, and though he's grey and bearded still has a tinge of red to his hair. Though he chuckles, he never once says \"ho ho ho!\", and he never once introduces himself by name. This is a Father Christmas that fits in very well with Narnia, I thought.C.S. Lewis was fascinated with both the works of creation around him, and those moments in life where they looked or felt or tasted spectacular. He used to describe them as \"the joy\". Though the beautiful scenery is mostly in the background, I think director Andrew Adamson had some idea of this, just by the way he sets up some of the shots. As a modern fantasy film, it is rather atmospheric compared to some of its contemporaries, whose plots and scenery just whiz by with no time to smell the flowers. Good job.C.S. Lewis was a devoted and intellegent Christian, and through the plot you can see that (Aslan is like Jesus, who has to die for Edmund's mistakes just like Jesus had to die for ours, etc). In the film, I notice a couple of visual themes had been added. The crossing and falling into the river reminded me a little of baptism for instance.There have been a couple of diversions from the book, some good, some not so good I say. I liked the World War II intro and the 1940s music while the kids play hide and seek, it gave the children's world a little more context which C.S. Lewis (writing in the early 1950s) would have most probably taken for granted. I didn't really appreciate the Hollywood-ness of the wolves. C.S. Lewis (just like Tolkien) was very particular about the words he used, and I don't know what he would have thought about some of the almost action movie villain lines the wolves have. Still, it's really only a minor point, that one.Special features on this version of the DVD include two audio commentaries from the crew and a blooper reel. In this bloopers everyone looks like they were having lots of fun, which is always a good sign. There's also a Narnia \"Fun Facts\" option, introduced by a relative of C.S. Lewis. When you turn the fun facts on during the film, they pop up, telling you bits and pieces about the making of the film, elements of the story and about the author C.S. Lewis. I'm a pretty avid C.S. Lewis fan, of both his life and his works, but I did actually learn some things. I had never made the connection that he died the same day as President Kennedy. 22nd of November 1963, honestly, that day gets stranger and stranger the more I hear about it...Anyway, I say its a good family film, a great fantasy, great primer for the rest of the series, and though it's not 100% to the book, it's good enough for me. However, I am very much hoping that they do the last half of \"Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" and the end of \"The Last Battle\" (my favorite bits of the series) exactly by the book, since they're such vivid and beautiful pieces of writing.\n",
      "This was purchased as a collectible, so it has not been opened.  However, from what you can see, it is tastefully done, and well worth the price.  I have viewed the DVD movie and shorts previously released, and it is a great film.  The special effects do not overwhelm the story, which sticks very close to the original.  The enclosed bookends are cast resin and painted, with great detail.  One side is of Lucy peering into the wardrobe, while the other end, is of Mr. Tumnus  on the other side, in the land of Narnia.\n",
      "Now I need to say that I liked the movie. Movie played with no problems. I really bought it to complete the series.\n",
      "I loved reading the Chronicles of Narnia when I was a kid. When I heard my husband hadn't read the books or seen the movie I made it my mission to give him the trilogy for Christmas. He was glued! He loved it! I think he watched all three within a 2-day time period. Bad thing was he was sick during that time period, good thing was he LOVED the movies! I hadn't seen the Disney version before so it was interesting to watch them. Needless to say, great movies and I would highly recommend the trilogy!\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia is a massive film. To compare to Lord of the Rings is unfair (and I won't since I didn't really care for the Ring Trilogy - never read the books either...). I think the more fair comparison would be the Harry Potter films. And even that isn't dead on.Let's start with the actors. The children are all engaging, but I couldn't help thinking that they could have found more earnest and, yes I'll say it, talented actors. Now...to give the devil his due...these children were forced to \"act\" with nothing! They were working with green screens and disks on sticks. It's extremely difficult for a trained and aged actor to perform their craft in those circumstances. However, it would still seem that the director should have coaxed some better performances out of the kids. Peter, in particular, seems uncomfortable at times acting. His delivery is often stilted and amateurish. Does it make him unlikable? Far from it. Undoubtedly these young actors were chosen, in part, because the expectation is there to carry on the film franchise and these kids are deemed to be up to the task. Having not read the books, I can only assume that the young actor playing Peter was chosen for his angelic looks and his earnest demeanor.Now to the film overall. It's definitely good. It, I understand, is somewhat true to the book (which I think is always good). However, I wanted a bit more. Why is the white queen bad? Why has she turned everything to ice and snow? (By the way, Tilda Swinton is great in the part!). In what is the childrens' appearance foretold? Is it a book? or merely a legend? You get my idea. It would seem that just a couple of sentences of extra \"backstory\" and expositional material could have made the film as robust as the detailed telling done in the Harry Potter films.The CGI effects...Aslan doesn't always look great. Sometimes he's uncannily real looking and other times, no. The fox never looks real. Occasionally the beavers look quite cartoonlike. I'm willing to bet the CGI effects will improve as the series continues. After all, Dobby, in Harry Potter, looked quite CGI to me and even Golum looked cartoonish at times in LOTR.Overall, this is a great family film and one that adults and kids alike will enjoy. Please don't let my criticism be viewed as anything more than it is. We're lucky that such films can now be made and our expectations of them are for that of reality. We've come a long way from the Ray Harryhausen days of stop motion animation...so much so that we can now criticize the animation and compare it to \"reality\".Get this film and you'll be happy you did.\n",
      "Excellent film, true to the book and C.S. Lewis's vision. Great for kids AND adults!!!\n",
      "Narnia was such a great movie.  In many ways it reminded me of Lord of the Rings, with all its great scenery, characters and epic plotlines.  The actors were fantastic, doing a great job, especially the youngest who should be greatly appreciated.  Overall a GREAT emotional and adventurous movie that everyone should see.\n",
      "What starts out looking like a boring weekend in a moth ball infested old house, turns in to an adventure for all time for four young children. For when they enter into a dusty wardrobe, passed the coats they come into a snow covered world of Narnia. Here they find magical creatures and find they are prophesized to rule the kingdom. In the meantime, the evil white witch does all she can to keep the little buggers down, but things really heat up when the former leader of the land, Aslan - a magnificent lion - returns to bring peace. The story culminates in a huge battle between good and evil.  The series of seven Narnia books were intended for children, so I needn't tell you how the battle turns out.In December of 2005, THE LION THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE made a huge appearance, traveling successfully to the screen. There have been sufficient animated and televised versions before, but this is the real deal with amazing sets and a pretty loyal screenplay. Like the books, the humor remains light and un-offensive. Even the story concepts, including an appearance by Father Christmas, are comfortable for the youngster in all of us. It is nothing like the complex structure used in the Harry Potter films that many children are devouring today.But after the monster success of THE LORD OF THE RINGS, the book did receive a face-lift.  Gone is the dialogue that only can be read to the very small in favor of a more mature speech.  Battles that took up a couple hundred words on the page are now major battles and even share an aesthetic with a certain hobbit adventure. The special effects creators are also shared with the RINGS trilogy.The Narnia stories are indeed a Christian allegory, but C.S.Lewis' message is lost on many on both sides of the argument.  He used biblical story elements as his own personal guide.  His major intention was not to preach, but to entertain.  Reviewers who dismiss the book and films based on its Christian ties are not likely to gain any converts.  Nor will those who demand the work be altered to explore those Christian themes.The DVD set is a strong offering:  Gorgeous sound and packaging, grand making of material, everything that is now expected from a major DVD release. One where every film is given the deluxe treatment, no matter how deserving.I'm looking forward to our next cinematic trip into Narnia... Prince Caspian... 2007\n",
      "This set of DVD's is great (if you liked the movie). There's not that much when it comes to added scenes, in comparison to the extended versions of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Lots of special features! Buy it!\n",
      "This is a movie about the story, not about the egos of the director, cast or crew.  That said, the acting is very good. These kids are first-rate, and Tilda was thrilling in all of her evil splendor.  (She was impressively-coached for the sword scenes.) The special-effects graphics were also very good.  On-par with LOTR and King Kong.In short summary, this movie has something for everyone except the cynics.\n",
      "If you loved the book, you'll love the movie.  Its the story come to life.  The role of Lucy is played to perfection by the person your mind's eye created.  The animation is first rate and blends flawlessly with the real actors and scenery.  The BBC version several years back was well done, but nothing before this movie captures the detail from the book.  The ultimate scene is the first look at Aslan, the lion.  He's everything he should be.\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe had hit the movies on December 9,2005. Many people including myself had gone to see it. Suprisingly i liked it. They had included William Moseley playing Peter Pevensie, Anna Popplewell playing Susan Pevensie, Skandar Keynes playing Edmund Pevensie and Georgie Henley playing young Lucy Pevensie. Director Andrew Adamson has takne 4 new actors and put them in a timeless classic by C.S.Lewis. The movie had a great deal of suspense, but it also delt with borthers and sisters love for eachother overcoming anything at all. When the white witch had captred Edmund, Peter, Susan, and Lucy will do anything to get him back. The white witch is played by Tilda Swinton does  fablous job playing her. But the true heros in the story are Aslan, voiced by Liam Neeson the king who watches over Narnia and Peter who learns that when pushed he can overcome great obsticules. All i know is that when everyone had thought the movie had ended a last part had happended and everyone was glued with there butt's to the seats, and eyes to the screen. If the Chronicles of Narnia is anything like Harry Potter it is going to be here for a long time.\n",
      "This is the most wholesome refreshing movie I have seen in a long time.I think it is already a classic and so glad to see the next series is being filmed. Also  the underlying Christian message was so meaningful\n",
      "Wonderful movie!! I really recommend that anyone who hasn't seen the series  gives it a try. I'm 20 and still love this movie.\n",
      "CS Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia may very well have been a book intended for children but it was also the result of a life through the Great Wars and the effects those wars had one the individual.  Gratefully in Andrew Adamson's directorial hands that part of the story that lends the need for the fantasy is preserved.The concept of separating children from their parents during the Blitz in London in WW II is now showing up in many novels.  Lewis was one of the first to address the trauma these separations had on children. Adamson opens his film with some fine footage of the aerial German blitz and the terror of the Londoners running for bomb shelters.  The family in focus is the Pevensie family - Lucy (Georgie Henley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Peter (William Moseley), and Susan (Anna Popplewell) - and these four children are sent off to a safe mansion owned by the Professor (Jim Broadbent).  The mansion has a wardrobe that begins the fantasy, Lucy being the first to enter the kingdom of Narnia through the back of the wardrobe.  Soon the four children are all together in the snowy place and encounter first a faun, then the Queen of Narnia/White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and there begins the struggle for domination and secrets that gradually resolve the mystery of Narnia, that mystery carefully paralleling Christianity through the forces of the kind Lion Aslan (Liam Neeson).The children are wonderful, especially Georgie Henley, and while the story deals with human creatures it is strong.  As the various CGI animals enter (fine though they may be as creations) the tale for this viewer weakens a bit, but that is a personal response.  In general with work like that from Tilda Swinton and Jim Broadbent along with the children, the movie form of Narnia is convincing and enchanting.  Quibbles aside, it is a charming film.  Grady Harp, April 06\n",
      "Has such a strong story, every child should have this series instead of what they are watching today. I hope they  will make all seven books as a movie so there will be a complete story. Bought it for my grandkids and for myself, loved it!!!\n",
      "I am eagerly anticipating the release of this DVD! Having saw the film in the theater, I must say that it was incredible. These are indeed good days for fantasy book lovers to see their imagination in action.\n",
      "It's a great fantasy movie.  Has parts that may be scary for a young child since their ability to decern reality and fantasy is blurred.  Personally, I love it and watch it with my 7 year old Granddaughter who also loves it. When she was barely six and saw it in the theater, she had to be reminded that it's a story and not real.  The sad parts made her cry.\n",
      "I only gave this movie 4 stars, because I felt that if you hadn't read the book, it would be hard to understand the story. And the actors could have been better. But, other than that, this movie features cool special effects, and is still very imaginative.\n",
      "This is an enjoyable movie with strong, though not too overt, Christian themes.The production and effects quality are excellent, and the story follows the book for the most part.\n",
      "There is plenty to say about the movie, from the special effects to the acting. The animals, for the first time, don't look ridiculous, and the humor isn't overdone. The story itself is timeless and the film captured it perfectly.However, the highlight of the movie for me was the White Witch. Between the amazing acting by Tilda Swinton and the amazing costumes and makeup, I was REALLY impressed. Her face is whiter than the snow itself, and her eyes darker than her heart. She was really a sight to see, and her presence completely made the movie for me.The best part was that Disney did not make it cheesy just to put smiles on parents' faces. They made it TASTEFULL. Not too much, not too little, just right.I'll be buying the DVD when it comes out, and I hope most people will at least rent it and experience a great film.\n",
      "I needed this movie for a school project with kids, and it came quicker than I expected. It was exactly what I ordered, and i got a great deal. THANKS!!\n",
      "When you have finished reading the book. . . watch the movie better if you do it with someone. The characters are terrific and the movie is true to the book. Watched it with my grandchildren after we read the book, it was a memorable experience.\n",
      "I was very surprised that did! I give it a four becuase of it's times of being boring! I was also very surprised that you could see that it was a christian movie as well as an action adventure movie!Over all I'd say it was an extremely good movie!P.S. Prince caspian, the fourth in the narnia series and also the second written, is coming to theaters late next year!Get this movie! watch it, love it. it's even good for your kids! bottomline is that you need to see it, you'll love it so then you can buy it here! WATCH THIS ONE, YOU WON\"T REGRET IT!\n",
      "Perhaps one of the greatest pieces of fantasy literature ever written, the Chronicles of Narnia has always been a classic. Since the Fellowship of the Ring entered theaters, it was never a question of whether a Narnia movie would eventually follow, but when. Now that it has arrived, I am perhaps left in awe of the incredibly original masterpiece that the creators of this film managed to give birth to.Long before this version came out, a low-budget version existed, produced by Wonderworks as a small family film. Because of this, when I saw today's Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe for the first time I judged it not only from the standpoint of a reader, but from that of someone who already has firmly set in his mind what makes a Narnia movie successful. It is possible that it was this rigid standpoint that so caused the movie to blow me away.The first and most important point I bring to bear is the casting. The four children chosen for the main roles were, in short, amazing. Georgie Henley, the actress for Lcy was expecially surprising, bringing a breath of fresh air to what seemed to be a Dakota Fanning-dominated age. In the older version, all of the actors were very close together in age, primarily because it was harder to work with young children. While there are certainly one or two moments where Henley's youth obviously led to some weak acting, the more realistic ages strengthened interaction between the children and improved characterization.On that note, one of C. S. Lewis's few weaknesses in the first books of the Chronicles of Narnia was a lack of characterization. While the plots were well thought-out and the writing magnificant, it was difficult to truly get to know the characters. I was highly impressed at how well the film portrays its characters, so that after watching the movie once I know those within it far better than I knew them from a lifetime of reading and rereading the book. Kudos to the writers for this.As far as visual effects, in most instances this movie easily matched the Lord of the Rings. This may be explained by the fact that both were done by WETA workshop. In any case, everything from the computer animation of Aslan and the centaurs to the detail of the armor was absolutely stunning.Finally, I can't finish this review without mentioning the soundtrack. The music was simply beyond words... With performances by Tam Linn, Imogen Heap, Lisbeth Scott, and Alanis Morissette hiding at the end, this is one of the few mavies that has compelled me to sit all the way through the credits. Harry Gregson-Williams's music throughout most of the movie was also stunning, and has kept me entranced with the Narnia the film portrays viewing after viewing after viewing.I could honestly go on all day about this movie, but I should probably stop. Let me sum my opinion up by saying that this movie deserved every one of its twelve awards and twenty-seven nominations. Future fantasy movies will have trouble being up to par with this one. As I await Prince Caspian's 2008 arrival with baited breath, I assure you all that this one video's wonder will keep you enchanted for years to come.\n",
      "What made my viewing of the following movie even more special than the film itself was the fact that I saw it with my best friend, her boyfriend and a few others, including my parents.Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media present Based On The Beloved Masterpiece By C.S. Lewis A Mark Johnson Production An Andrew Adamson Film \"The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe.\"I read the series last Christmas (my aunt having bought it for me; see my review of the one-volume edition) in anticipation of this movie. The teaser and theatrical trailers inflamed my desire to see this film even further. Read on for the result.The finished product is-what else can I say that hasn't been said already? The acting, visuals and special effects are all top-notch, as expected for such a mammoth production and is sure to please the millions of fans who have read the series. Even those who haven't read it will be thrilled. Liam Neeson (\"Schindler's List,\" \"STAR WARS Episode I,\" \"Batman Begins\"; see my reviews on all of them) was perfect as the voice of Aslan, the lion (a figurative representation of Jesus Christ). In a recent interview, director Andrew Adamson said, \"If you loved the books, you'll love the movie. If you found Christian meaning in the books, you'll find it in the movie.\" This movie has something for everyone: epic battle scenes, humorous moments and heart. The movie's central message isn't lost on me: it is those who love us who lift us up when we are most in need. That is very true in my own life.Mild Caution: The movie is rated PG for battle sequences, all of which is blood-free. Still, these scenes, while exciting, the White Witch's evil minions, though no scarier than the creatures in \"Lord Of The Rings,\" and the bombing of London which opens the film, may prove too intense for very young children. Parents may want to leave their very young offspring under seven years of age at home. A good way to get them introduced to the world of Narnia is to read them the stories, so that they will better understand the film when they see it. I highly recommend this motion picture to Christians and non-Christians alike. You will love this movie. Rated PG for battle sequences and frightening moments.\n",
      "Good movie, clean, family friendly\n",
      "The best in Narnia Series. The first is not always the best in a Trilogy. But this one is an exception.\n",
      "This was a very good movie. It was a bit long for me. I'm not sure how much it could have been shortened but if I had watched it in a theater instead of home where I could pause it and take a break I'm not sure how much I would have enjoyed it.\n",
      "This seven-book effort by C.S. Lewis was the third children's series which I've read and thoroughly enjoyed as a child (the first being L. Frank Baum's Oz books, the second Lloyd Alexander's five novels of Prydain). I'm in my 30s so it's a bit hard to hearken back to that sense of wonder and delight elicited by Mr. Lewis and his creation. What remains is a whiff of nostalgia and a certain recognition that yes, once upon a time, Narnia was a huge, essential piece of my formative childhood.The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an excellent film adaptation of the novel and nicely sets up the series. This opener tells the tale of the four Pevensie children - Peter, the oldest of the quartet; Susan, the maternal, practical older sister; the stubborn, angry Edmund; and the youngest, Lucy. To escape the bombings of WW2 London, the children are sent by their mother to the safety of a professor's rural household. There, involved in a hide & seek game, they go thru a wardrobe and happen upon Narnia, a magical land cursed with a Hundred-Year Winter and inhabited by fauns, centaurs, talking beasts and the seemingly immortal evil White Witch. And inhabited also by Aslan, the wonderful lion and deux-ex-machina of the series. So there -  the stage is set, the personalities introduced, the conflict layed out, and any more details would just be giving the story away.The kid actors are obviously instrumental to the success of the film. William Mosely as Peter and Anna Popplewell as Susan are serviceable. Peter is bland and at times looks awkward as the older Son of Adam; Susan just doesn't have enough to do here, but even in the book, her character is the least filled out. It is the two younger siblings, Lucy and Edmund, as portrayed by Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes, who shine in the spotlight. Children in the viewing audience will doubtless be seeing the film thru Lucy's eyes, more so than thru any of the other characters' herein. Georgie as Lucy carries that burden exceedingly well, emoting with a natural skill more suited for older thespians. She has several scenes with Aslan that were key to the forwarding of the movie, as well as the lending of empathy towards Aslan, and she convincingly pulls them off.  Skalar is an even more mature actor and provides the early conflict in the movie and does it with such ease, I found myself disliking him from the get-go. The grown-ups do a credible job, especially James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus and Jim Broadbent as the benevolent professor. Tilda Swinton could've been more demonstrative in her role as the Witch but her under-the-top acting - her intense stillness, if you will - is explained in great detail in the extra features (the kids' commentary, to be exact).The special effects are very good, which is to be expected, given our current technological state. Aslan, the beavers, and the rest of the talking beasts and fairy tale creatures are realized convincingly. The big battle at the finale is a tad reminiscent of the battles in the Lord of the Rings in terms of the combatants involved, but *shrug* given the make-up of these fantastical movies, what else can you expect but to see orcs, giants and sundry magical uglies? The fight scenes are nothing exceptional, but do remember that these are mostly kids in lead roles and they remain somewhat realistic in their military prowess (I did cringe when Peter cheesily pointed his sword at the Witch, when she entered Aslan's camp and demanded Edmund be given to her). There is a fair amount of violence here: swordplays, arrows hitting their mark, the Witch callously turning Narnians to stone and a grim scene with Aslan on the stone table, being brutalized by the Witch's minions and then, finally, by the Witch herself. All acts aren't overly gory (this film is rated PG) and are depicted with the targeted children in mind and they also happen to be necessary to be true to the books, especially the last scene mentioned.There's been incessant talk (to ad nauseam, I feel) of Lewis's insertions of religious overtones in the film (Aslan, whose father is the Emperor Over the Sea, is obviously meant to be Narnia's version of Jesus; in A Magician's Nephew, a later Narnia installment, there is even a blatant scene involving a forbidden apple). Here's my take:  reading the Narnia Chronicles as a kid, I was quite oblivious to all the religious connotations, references to sons of Adam and daughters of Eve notwithstanding; but I don't for one second believe missing out on the Christian themes herein harmed or benefited me in any way.  Listen,  I endorse everyone's personal right to believe in and follow his/her own God. If parents wish to point out these theological aspects to their kids, that is, of course, totally within their purview.  Lewis's religious references do provide gentle guides to the ways of Christianity. However,  I feel that this offering by C.S. Lewis shouldn't be used as a polarizing tool for Christians and non-Christians and should above all be enjoyed as an excellent adventure book/film for children and adults alike.So, overall, four stars for this dvd. There is an abundance of extra features, which are informative and entertaining. There are so-so outtakes; one filmmaker/adult commentary, another commentary by the kids and director Andrew Adamson; an in-depth \"making of\" documentary, various diaries...all in all, they validate the price of this 2-disc dvd. Why not give it five stars, you ask? Because, in direct comparison with the Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter series, this film falls a slight notch below. But, having said that, I still cannot wait for the sequel and subsequent films. Go Lucy and Aslan!\n",
      "I sent this DVD to my granddaughter for her birthday. She loved it. Thanks for the great service.\n",
      "We love this movie and have watched it several times already.  This is good for adults and young people.  Thanks\n",
      "How can this classic not be loved. The special effects to create the characters was amazing. Of course, the 4 children were cast perfectly. I had the animated version on VHS and it was a favorite of my son's. Well, both of us. C.S. Lewis would be proud.\n",
      "\"THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE\" is a glorious example of exceptional production design, excellent cinematography, wonderful special effects and CGI-created characters, incredible fight choreography, swordplay, stunts, great music, dazzling costumes, fantastic characterizations, and, most important of all, the film (for the most part) stays close to the book written by C.S. Lewis. The film is set during World War II. It is the epic story of the four Pevensie children - Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley). They enter the land of Narnia through a mysterious wardrobe. There they do battle with the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton), become friends with a faun named Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy), and have dinner with Mr. and Mrs. Beaver (Ray Winstone and Dawn French). To the fans of the books, such as my own humble self, the movie will leave you in complete awe and amazement. To the ones who have not yet read the books, it may confuse you, but it will soon transfix you to the seat. All the acting is magnificent, especially with Georgie Henley, James McAvoy, Tilda Swinton, and the voice talent of Liam Neeson. Each of their characters resonate with such power and personality that it is impossible for you not to be amazed. Henley plays Lucy with a great sense of innocence and courage, having the best performance in the entire film. To me, having read all the books, Lucy is the central character. In my opinion, she is really the only character the audience can totally identify with throughout the series. Director Andrew Adamson seems to notice this, and being one of the script-writers, he uses the other characters, dialogue, and situations to be mainly formed around her role in the film. Maybe that is why Henley is perfect for the part. Let's hope everything stays this way (with her character at least) through the remaining films. McAvoy portrays Mr. Tumnus as a true patriot, fighting for his Narnia. He is ordered to turn in Lucy to the Witch, but Lucy is probably his only friend, and he has high hopes for a peaceful and just Narnia. His character's feelings and beliefs are just a few examples of those of every Narnian exhibited in the film. McAvoy's performance is amazing in its brilliance. Tilda Swinton is magnificently evil, a trait that can only be found in the White Witch, like something chiseled out of ice (pun intended). Her performance is simply perfect. Neeson's voice as Aslan fills the theater with booming presence and deep resonance, yet its own calm and quiet assurance. I never knew that just a voice from such an accomplished actor could inhabit a CGI-created character so well, not to mention the superior animation of the character itself. However, the entire cast is sensational. Keynes, Popplewell, Moseley, Winstone, French, and others are almost as incredible as the film's best performances. The kids are not confused or disoriented about what they must do, they just do it because they know it's the right thing to do. The Witch just oozes with so much evil that even the words I am using in this review cannot describe it. Another cast member that I must mention specifically is Jim Broadbent as Professor Digory Kirke. He is the only character on this side of the wardrobe (besides the kids) that has truly great acting talent. I see the Professor as their Earthly guidance, while Aslan is the perfect counterpart as their Narnian guidance. Both of the characters are the symbol of strength for the children - what binds them together and keeps them true to each other. It is really Peter and Susan's discussion with Professor Kirke that shows them that you do not have to do anything but believe. Listen for Rupert Everett in a small but heroic role as the Fox, watch for James Cosmo as Father Christmas. One last comment on the acting - I am always floored by how well the mannerisms, dialogue, and characters of the four main cast members matches up with their older counterparts. Also surprising is how fantastic the acting talents of the actors and actresses that played the older versions of the children are, even though they do not have much screen time. Definitely one of the greatest sequences in the film is the battle between the Narnians and the forces of the Witch. I adore the action sequences, especially the ones in this final confrontation. And, if you believe in the allegories between the Chronicles of Narnia and the Holy Word of God (like myself), the scene where Aslan is one-on-one with the Witch will have particular meaning for you. A wonderful film.SPECIAL FEATURESBloopersDiscover Narnia Fun Facts (Optional trivia pop-ups throughout film)Audio Commentary with director Andrew Adamson, William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie HenleyAudio Commentary with director Andrew Adamson, producer Mark Johnson, and production designer Roger FordAlso Recommended: STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE (1999), LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (2001), LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS (2002), LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING (2003), PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (2003)THIS REVIEW IS DEDICATED TO ANYONE, LIVING OR DEAD, INVOLVED IN THE PAST, PRESENT, OR FUTURE \"CHRONICLES OF NARNIA\" UNIVERSE.\n",
      "The Computer Generated Effects are astonishing. I enjoyed the World War II sequence in London and as was the practice, if possible, to move children (the central protagonists) to the countryside which was not the usual target of the Nazis. I loved the slow and methodical buildup as the four Pevensie children eventually discover a secret passage into NARNIA an extra-dimensional Kingdom where good and evil struggle.  If you are unfamiliar with the story it is unfair to say more. The landscapes, colors, music and the overall atmosphere are all very beautiful. I was very moved.\n",
      "Narnia is another of these tongues in the cheek movies created by Walt Disney Productions as a perfect entertainment device for the family.Four children in the Second War are sent to a big mansion and precisely to run away from the horror of the surrounding reality, Lucy will be the first to discover the magical gate behind of an inoffensive wardrobe who will lead her to Narnia.Once she has discovered it, she will come back with Edmund and finally when the entire crew of brothers trespass the boundaries, the adventure will be  about to start.The inclusion of the sword on the ice remits us immediately to Excalibur, specially when you relate it with the speech of Aslan, once it has returned to life.Tilda Swinton is overwhelming as the White witch. The imaginative stages and the rest of the plot are an invitation to us on order to let us carry by the wings of the fantasy in this colossal saga, where the heroism and redemption will liberate to the people of this oppressed land.Or perhaps were we part of a dream into a dream?\n",
      "De Amerikaanse rockband WhiteHeart zong in 1992 Read the Book, don't wait for the movie. Hoewel ik jarenlang op Christian Artists Seminars de Narnia Chronicles van C.S. Lewis heb verkocht, had ik de allegorische vertellingen rondom het bijbelse evangelie nooit zelf gelezen. Vorige week via de bibliotheek wel de DVD The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in de Nederlandse editie (De Leeuw, De Heks en De Kleerkast) geleend en gisteravond bekeken.De Kijkwijzer aanduiding 12 is terecht, ik zou 'm zoon Johan (7) nu niet willen voorschotelen, omdat m'n eigen nachtrust ook wat waard is. Ook de kritiek op de 'zalvende toon' kan ik wel begrijpen. De dialogen klinken vaak erg belegen, zo niet bekakt. Aan de andere kant is het een sprookje en geen verhaaltje voor op het schoolplein. Als christen ben ik verder sterk bevooroordeeld en merk ik (on)bewust Narnia te toetsen aan de Bijbel. Ik ben dus wel benieuwd hoe een ongelovige deze film beleeft en interpreteert.De visualisatie van de landschappen, het kasteel en sprookjesfiguren als faun 'meneer Tumnus', witte heks Jadis en cast Edmund, Lucy, Peter en Susan zijn sterk, om nog maar niet te spreken van de pratende leeuw Aslan, bevers, vos en wolven. Voor de liefhebbers: momenteel wordt gewerkt aan de verfilming van Prince Caspian, het vierde deel van de Narnia-kronieken. Deze zal begin 2008 in de bioscopen te zien zijn. Aan jou de keuze: eerst het boek of de film.\n",
      "I read the book long ago, so after we enjoyed Thanksgiving dinner, our Georgia family decided to show this movie. I knew that I would want to have a copy of my own to share with my other grandchildren\n",
      "how could anyone give this film a low rate. what?? i don't get it. excellent picture i absolutely loved it. it had a huge dose of magic, tons of fantasy, and a tad bit of reality. this is for both children and adults, and very enjoyable by both. the story is great, the whole setup, the animals, everything was beautiful. their imagination really went out of the roof with this one. it had four young children, a magic wardrobe, talking lion, icy witch, the cutest beavers, and just about any other imaginable animal you can think of. it's good against evil, and the prophecy will be fulfilled. if you have not seen it, it is a must see. this story just makes you want more of it. i expected good, but not great. and this sure greatly exceeded my expectations. it's okay to escape reality every now and then. first there was neverland and now there's narnia. it's movies like this that make you wish these place really exsisted. just a short 135 minute escape from the real world.\n",
      "Always enjoyed this movie! Nice to be able to access it here now, easy to purchase, and quality was good on my tv.\n",
      "After having taught Lewis's prequel, The Magician''s Nephew to a group who were not familiar with the Narnia books, I showed this film to reward them for hard work and challenging creative writing responses and to encourage them to read the rest of the series.  The students thoroughly enjoyed it!\n",
      "Awesome movie!  Loved by our entire family.  It was very true to C.S. Lewis' book.  We waited until our children were a little older to watch it with them, and it was entirely worth the wait!\n",
      "Who wouldn't want to dwell in a world where animals talk, legendary creatures roam the lands, doing right is honored, and humans are given royal crowns?I first heard of C.S. Lewis and his Chronicles of Narnia in the early 1990's. I have not read any of the seven books, but perhaps I will in the near future. I am thankful that director Andrew Adamson wanted to make Narnia as real as possible; and he, along with the producers, had agreed to make a film that faithfully tells C.S. Lewis' story of courage, hope, faith, and love.Director of photography Donald McAlpine and Production Designer Roger Ford have wonderfully captured stunning imagery and created a detailed world of Narnia. Both photography of and production pieces for Narnia are absolutely beautiful. The visual effects and CGIs are incredibly real, especially the character Aslan. Together with the cool visual effects, make-up, costumes, and prop pieces, what makes this film special is the charm of the four young cast members (William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie Henley) and the enchanting music score by Harry Gregson-Williams.The packaging of the 4-Disc Extended Edition is great. I can actually remove the discs from the case without bending them! I wished other studios had DVD cases as well designed as this one.DISC 1:  Reviewers are saying the extended version contains about 8 additional minutes of inserted scenes. I suggest that if you already own the 1-Disc DVD, get this Extended Edition.  If you own the 2-Disc Special Edition, then you must decide what interests you the most.  If I had owned the 2-Disc set, I still would have purchased the 4-Disc Extended Edition because I enjoy the behind-the-scenes, movie-making features. Whether you think the extended scenes are worth the additional cost, you can at least use the $10 rebate if you own previous Narnia DVD releases from Disney and Walden Media.  Decide soon, because this 4-Disc set will be going back to Disney's vault on January 31 2007.The two sets of commentaries are absolutely enjoyable!  I have listened to both. I think the Kids' & Director Commentary is one of my all time favorites! The re-telling of their experiences on set in front of and behind the cameras made me laugh several times and provided a lot of fun information about their performance and directing challenges.  Definitely worth listening to!Bloopers is another fun featurette to watch. In the Director's & Kids commentary, the kids talk about some of the bloopers that are shown in this (and only this) featurette. It goes by quick, so be alert when viewing it.DISC 2: In the Creatures Of The World menu (within Creatures, Lands and Legends), or in Creating Creatures menu (within Creating Narnia\\Evolution Of An Epic), you will notice an icon of the wardrobe under Centaurs.  Clicking on the icon will toggle the background of the menu (between colored illustration and pencil sketched illustration). You will also get a different feature presentation of each creature.  Nice! With the colored background, clicking on a creature's name will start a short presentation about that creature from one of the Narnia books. With the pencil sketched background, clicking on a creature' name will launch a behind-the-scenes presentation of the creature for the movie.In the Evolution Of An Epic menu (within Creating Narnia), move your pointer to the chair on the left and click on the ornament icon on the chair.  It will launch a behind-the-scenes segment of Skandar and Turkish Delight. Yum!I like Cinematic Storytellers, where you get interesting perspectives of the making of the movie from: costumer designer, Weta workshop designer, creature designer, production designer, cinematographer, editor, music composer, and producer.DISC 3: Finally, we are treated with a 75 minute feature of the life of C.S. Lewis.  It is a very interesting and touching first person narrative of his life. I found it helpful in my understanding of the motivation, purpose, and creative resources behind the writing of Chronicles of Narnia.  We also get interesting perspectives from his stepson, Douglas Gresham.  I am amazed how C.S Lewis' life and writings still impact us today!DISC 4: Ahh, more stuff about the making of the movie!  I love it! Your choices are: Visualizing The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe; Anatomy Of A Scene: Behind The Battle; and Art Of Narnia.In Visualizing The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe, you will experience the movie with pop-up inserts of several key film members explaining the scenes.  Basically it is a video commentary of the film. Very nice.  I think some of the contents are from Disc 2, but you get much more!  It reminds me of what HD-DVD and Blu-ray discs will or should provide to the viewer.  Imagine watching the movie in commentary mode which displays a horizontal split-screen or pop-up of the cast and crew discussing the scenes.The motion picture, The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe, is an instant classic and has become one of my all time favorites. Although it contains violence and images that may not be appropriate for younger children, its lack of gore and foul-language is a plus. I wish Hollywood would get the message that movies like this can be very profitable (not only economically).Thank you Andrew Adamson, Perry Moore, Mark Johnson, K.C. Hodenfield, Philip Steuer, Douglas Gresham, and many others who brought this story to life. Because of this film, I have experienced the enchanted land of Narnia more than once.\n",
      "I thorougly enjoyed watching the Chronicles of Narnia movies. This first movie in the aeries does not disappoint. They are greatly entertaining and the 3D amazing. Recommended for the whole family.\n",
      "Muy buen diseño, lastima que no sea como la presentan, porque no viene incluido el Libro de la foto\n",
      "They picked a winner in the actress chosen for Lucy. Everyone played their roles well and it followed the book pretty well. A nice classic and great for the kids\n",
      "OH MY GOSH I LOVE THIS MOVIE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH IT IS LIKE THE AWESOMEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!AND PETER (WILLIAM MOSELEY) IS SOOOOOOO HOT AND I AM TOTALLY GUNNA MARRY HIM!!!! WHY DO SOME OF YOU PEOPLE THINK IT SUCKED!!???????? IT ROCKED!\n",
      "After the Star Wars prequels hurt me so bad for being aweful - I just wanted one more great escapist movie.  And Narnia delivers.  I actually think LOTR are better made movies, but this one is so easy to sit down, watch, lose yourself and escape.  I am a fan of the books too - and I applaud the adaptation.\n",
      "This was a wonderful rendition of the book, and it brought to life everything that I read in the book. It was pretty much how I pictured it -breathtakingly beautiful. The special effects were wonderful, and all the talking animals looked SO real. And I found out that Peter, Edmund and later Caspian were REALLY riding the horses! I was thrilled because I'm an avid horse rider myself. Anyways, all the cast did so well, and the other movies are terrific as well. LOVE IT!\n",
      "Allow me to approach this review in this way, which is as question and answers.IS THE MOVIE FAITHFUL TO THE BOOK?  Reviewers and viewers answer the question differently.  In a sense, both are right.  The movie is faithful to the book as far as basic plot, characters, and atmosphere.  There are changes made that are not in the book, but these changes are usually for the purpose of a) helping the viewer understand the historic setting, such as the movie's beginning, or b) adding to the entertainment value of the movie, adding humor (e.g. the beavers) or suspense (I don't remember the children riding a piece of ice in the original, though it has been well over 25 years since I read the book).IS THE MOVIE SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN?  If and only if a parent accompanies them.  This movie lives up to the PG rating.  Other reviewers pointed out there is plenty of scariness in the movie, especially the battle scene.  But I don't think there is anything that would be overly traumatic if the child is accompanied by the parent.  (By the way, I believe that the parent should be with the child in viewing any movie or any TV show.)IS THE MOVIE A \"CHRISTIAN MOVIE\"?  Disney making a Christian movie?  Seriously, there are themes that a Christian would recognize in the movie, which would need to be there to be faithful to the book.  These allusions are such that a non-Christian would miss them, without losing appreciation for the story.  This is not like \"The Passion.\"  However, a Christian can use the film in witnessing to unbelievers, pointing out the parallels between Aslan and Jesus.Allow me to make a few other comments.  I think Tilda Swinson did a good job with the character.  One reviewer used the term underplayed.  In some stories, the villain is more interesting, memorable, and maybe even likeable than the hero, and Swinson's performance keeps this from happening.  I also loved the beavers.I am looking forward to the release of Prince Caspian, the next of the series.  If it is half as good as this movie, it would be very good.\n",
      "For those who love the Narnia Chronicles, written by one of the twentieth century's finest writers, C.S. Lewis, the story of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe needs no introduction. Rather than belabour the plot, I would like to focus purely upon this film in terms of the elements that make it so appealing.First of all, the story itself is a wonderful one. C.S. Lewis was one of those writers who wrote genuinely ORIGINAL stories. Of course he incorporated existing story elements, but he did not rely solely upon them. Running through his stories at all times is the magical gold thread of intelligent creativity. (His turn of phrase is wonderful, both in his fiction and non-fiction.) The director has been remarkably scrupulous in keeping to the text, particularly in comparison with film versions of other books.Secondly, the characters are not one-dimensional. The four children, as presented both in the book and in the film, are beautifully fleshed out as real and imperfect beings, but one cannot help delighting in them. Even Edmund, whose greed blinds him to the selfishness of his choice to betray his brother and sisters to the White Witch, is a sympathetic character as he develops and as he is faced with the consequences of what he has done.Thirdly, the acting in this film is frankly superb. Tilda Swinton is marvellously well controlled in her portrayal of the White Witch. This is a role that would be so terribly easy to overdo, but Ms Swinton knows full well the remarkable effectiveness of subtlety. My two adorable little nieces were utterly impressed by her - evidence that children are not blind to subtle and superb acting. The children were excellently played - what a treat to see that there do exist children who CAN act. In particular, the role of Lucy was extraordinarily effective, but Peter was extremely well played, Edmund was superb in his sullenness and later his true sorrow, and Susan was charming as a girl trying to be sensible, taking too much responsibility upon herself and feeling the pressure of her care for others. And Mr Tumnus the fawn! Wonderfully done! Also magnificent is Liam Neelson's voicing of Aslan, the Lion himself. The smaller roles (the wonderfully portrayed beavers, the fox, the wolves, Father Christmas, the Professor, etc.) are all excellently done; I can only give praise.Fourthly, the battle scenes are extremely well choreographed. They convey a sense of the realness of what is at stake, rather than prettying up the whole business.Fifthly, magnificent cinematography. It is truly beautiful to watch (even though I do feel the snow looks a little fake... but in all honesty, this is a very minor consideration).Sixthly, extremely good special effects. I remain amazed by the image of the fawn, by the centaurs, by the Lion, by all the creatures.This is quite a long film, but I did not feel it was too long at all. It moved beautifully, and there were some very vivid moments, such as the dancing of the pipe by Mr Tumnus when he first decides to capture Lucy for the White Queen. Magical indeed is the effect - the feeling of drowsiness, the wonderful and strange music, the dancing flames.There are a few things which I'd have liked to see improved. Firstly, there were some musical elements which I feel did not work. For instance, the opening theme - very Celtic, very  breath-in-the-voice singing - seemed to me to have absolutely nothing to do with this film.Secondly, the director seemed not to care that British children of this class and this period did not give each other soap-opera hugs. Once or twice would have been perfectly adequate for such hugs in the film, to express extraordinary situations. But there were too many of these hugs, when a stiff upper lip and a carefully directed sense of \"I feel more than I choose to show, because it simply isn't done\" would have been so much more effective. I'd have ditched the last two hugs at least - or ditched the earlier two and kept the last one.But really, these are minor quibbles. I was enchanted with the film, and I hope to see more of the Narnia Chronicles make it to the screen, done as well as this one.One more thing: I'm puzzled as to why the editorial review above could mention (presumably in all seriousness) the superiority of the Harry Potter influence. None of the Harry Potter films are graced with such fine acting in the children's parts as is this film; none of the Harry Potter films feature originality to anywhere near the same extent as this film (understandably - Rowling is a competent writer, whereas C. S. Lewis is a great writer); and finally the extremely well-marketed Harry Potter phenomenon is irrelevant with regards to this film.Enjoy this film. I was charmed by it at the cinema, and I shall have no hesitation is purchasing this DVD set as soon as it's released.\n",
      "It arrived on time and looks to be in excellent condition.  I can't wait to give this to my grandson for Christmas.  My kids watched all the movies (early cartoon ones) and I have the books!  Great storylines.\n",
      "This is an allegory that helps us better understand the giants we face in life, our fears and our dependency on one another. It is an outstanding movie with great background scenery and sound effects.\n",
      "One of the greatest children/adult movies out! It's the best one of the 3 Narnia movies released and is worth owning. Whether the characters are adorable or wicked, the acting is superb. I love the storyline that brings reality into a secret world of fun, fantasy and challenges.\n",
      "I never read the books so I didn't really know anything about the premise of the story besides the fact that kids are magically transported to a mystical world and must defeat the evil Queen.Let me just say I was floored with the top knotch quality of this film.  Definitely was instantly put on my top 10 list of films and the most entertained I have been coming out of a theater in a long long while.  For those avid fans that are obsessed with the book I really hope you can separate the books and the movies (they are NEVER meant to be exactly the same) because this is a masterpiece.Whether you're a fan of fantasy movies or not or you're not even an avid movie goer, DEFINITELY take the time to at least watch this one.  You WONT be disappointed.\n",
      "I saw The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe when i was in Sydney. I was addicted to it, i saw it 7 times and i owned tons of Narnia stuffs. I think that it was the greatest movie ever. The acting is amazing, the story is unforgettable, the scenary is breathtaking and the music is perfect.During World War II, 4 childrens, whose name is Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy Pevensie was being evacuated from London. They lived on the countryside, in a huge mansion, owned by an old professor. There, they found an old wardrobe, which lead them to the land of Narnia. Narnia, a magical land, enslaved by an evil White Witch for 100 years. However, there is a prophecy, that 2 sons of Adam and 2 daughters of Eve will come to defeat the White Witch and restore peace to Narnia. With the help of Aslan, the Lion God of Narnia, a destiny will be fulfilled and the chronicles will begin...A must see movie of all times.\n",
      "With respect, some of the reviews here are almost as long as the movie itself, so I'll try to keep this short.I was a little concerned before going to see this movie as I have been terribly disappointed in most of what Disney has turned out over the last few decades. The storyline was mostly true to the book and the casting was almost perfect (Lucy being perfect, the White Witch was a bit iffy).The best thing of all though, is not something IN the movie, but something that was left out! The ubiquitous and awful Disney songs that have plagued their movies (even the good ones)all these years. To whomever fought to keep them out, I thank you!Some may think the movie a little violent for children, but the books are actually more graphic in this respect and besides, we who grew up on a diet of WWII, Cowboys and Indians and even Tom and Jerry all turned out OK.I have the movie pre ordered and will have no hesitation letting my 3 and 5 year olds watch it.\n",
      "I ordered this movie for my nephew and he just loves it and the best thing is that it got here on time. he liked it so much that he asked me to order the second Narnia movie, Prince Caspian. i know if he enjoyed this one he'll definitely enjoy the second one.\n",
      "This is a beautiful movie.  It's a lot like Lord of the Rings, but more for children aka no blood.  I read the C.S. Lewis series as a kid and also watched the original movies.  I was shocked to say the least that Disney managed to make the movie so close to the book that it was as if I was reading the book all over again.  All the characters were enchanting, the boys were strong and during the battle scene it was ovbious the love they felt for each other in a manly way.  I loved Lucy, but I felt after reading the reviews that Susan was overlooked.  Her witty, yet sweet performance has me wanting to see more of her.  I hope they make all the books into movies.  As for the religious aspect of this movie that people are talking about...for me there is none.  Narnia is a magical land ruled by a \"deep magic\" and for those of us who still believe in it that is all that matters.  This movie of course does have some scary parts, no worse than Barbie: Magic of Pegasus and the battle scene is violent, but all in all a great movie for any child to see.  I would suggest reading the book before seeing the movie and also strongly suggest that parents are with their children at all times when they first see the movie as they will have questions.  This is a wonderfull movie for young and old alike-don't miss it!\n",
      "I was so excited to buy this movie because to me, it's an all time classic! Everyone grows up reading the Narnia series in school. I remember seeing this film for the first time and I've fell in love with it ever since!!! Great to add to my collection.\n",
      "C. S. Lewis was a superb writter. I wrote reviews of all of his Narna books. This film is delightful. It is a pleasure to watch all of the characters, especially the youngest child Lucy who is the most charming. She discovers the magical world of Narnia, which can be entered by going to the back of a wardrobe. The country is suffering a perpetual winter because it is being ruled by the cruel self centered white witch. Fortunately, there is a prophecy that the great lion Aslan will come and defeat the white witch (think of the evils in our world and the prophecy of a coming messiah). He will be aided by four humans who will rule over Narnia. The four are Lucy, her sister, and two brothers. The book and film can be viewed on two levels. People can take the fable at face value and simply enjoy it or they can search for the religious sumbolism that C. S. Lewis intentionally inserted. Either way, it is a delight.\n",
      "I was happy to get my package on time like i was told and i had no problems with my dvd. i will definitely buy again from this person.\n",
      "I first saw this movie when I was about 7 years old. Since then, I have seen it twice more. I really like this film, but would not recommend it to very young children, as there are somewhat unsettling creatures in a few scenes.  The reason I chose to rate it as a four-star movie instead of a five-star movie is that I had the distinct pleasure of reading the book it was based on, which was much better. If you see this movie and like it, I urge you to read The Chronicles Of Narnia, by C. S. Lewis. There are seven books in all, this movie being based on the second.On another note, there were two more movies made: Prince Caspian,(based on the fourth book,) and Voyage of the Dawn Treader, (based on the fifth book.) These two films are not as good as this one, and therefore I give you two warnings. The first is for people who have read the books. These two movies are much more different from the book than this movie is. The basic plot is the same, but the little details and events that make the book worth wile are absent from the movies, especially the last and most recent, Voyage of the Dawn Treader. The second warning is for everyone. The last two movies are much darker than the first. For example, this movie has a war and evil witch. Prince Caspian has the same. However, in this film, it is bloodier and more evil, which is a shame because Prince Caspian and Voyage of the Dawn Treader are some of the most facinating books in the series.\n",
      "Just imagine the fantastic Narnia with the best sound and screen resolution available today.Perfect!If you have a full high definition equipment, an envolving surround and HD monitor you'll have the sensation you are living in Narnia's land.\n",
      "This product is Fantastic. Even though they've shortened the title. It's The Real Thing!!! Even though I live all the way in Australia and this item had a shipping wait on it, it arraived within a month and about 27 day's before the estimated arrival date. The shipping probably doen't have everything to do with this product or even Amazon but it's still Good. Very Good Product. Brand NEW. BUY IT!!!\n",
      "I bought one set (for myself) and was so disappointed that I immediately ordered two more for my grandchildren.The bookends really set off my books and movies that have similarities to Narnia & other magical/mythical realms.  They have earned a prominent setting to bring attention to those particular movies & books.About the dvd set - very good and the Prince Caspian by Disney also fits well with it.\n",
      "This first installment in the \"Narnia\" series may be the best action/adventure movie ever made.  Aside from some minor changes, the movie stays remarkably close to C.S. Lewis's original novel.  The only real differences are that the movie goes into more detail than the book in places, but it always works.  (For example, the climactic battle in the movie is a huge, major scene, where as the book only devotes a couple paragraphs of retrospect to it.)  Even book purists should love this movie.\n",
      "1st of the Narnia series really was very good. Helped to explain the beginning since we watched the 3rd Series first.\n",
      "I was overall very impresed witht his movie from start to finish. i have read the book many times in school and loved it and could not wait to see the movie. When the film was released many people loved it but many people said it wa sok and not good so I was skeptick. When I finally got to watch it I loved it from begging to the thrilling end. The story about siblings who go through a magic wardrobe and into another land called Narnia there they battle a whitch and meet many memerable charactors. The story is fased paced and will have you on the edge of your seat. The charactors are all great and memrable I loved everyone from the evil witch to Aslen the lion. the direction was great and the visuals were outstanding. I would say it's not as good as Harry Potter or Lord of the rings but it's up there as the best fantasy movie that ytou could watch over and ovver again. Overall it's a great adaptaion from the book it's an exciting magical grand adventure of a movie.\n",
      "Great story and special effects! Even though it is a childrens adventure fantasy, we adults do enjoyed it as well.\n",
      "I love this series and this dvd plays on Blu Ray as well as in a regular DVD player which makes it very flexible.\n",
      "If you read the book you should love the movie.  If you did not read the book and you are a fan of fantasy, fairy tales, and all that go with this genre then you should love it too.This is a great story made into an excellent film.  Christian themes are incorporated and the beauty of sacrifice is exposed.  Many church groops took field trips to see this film as it is said to be an allegory for the new testament.  You don't have to be religous to appreciate the film however, remember it is a childrens story which simply provides positive ideals that happen to be similar to the ideals christ set forth in the new testament.  Ideals like love, honor, sacrifice, and so on.Great for any child over the age of five and great for the child in all us adults.  (I'm 28 years old)Finally the movie is made and distributed by Disney ( in association with Walden Media) who has done a great job with the special effects as they did with Pirates of the Caribean.All around this is a great film for all, and one of the must see movies of 2005.\n",
      "Some past reviewers have made comparisons (or stated their preference) between this film and Lord of the Rings.  With this film - and book - I found it easier to take in a bit-sized portion, rather than a multi-course al-a-carte meal that is far more difficult to digest.  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, having an appropriately designated PG rating, is great for kids.  The mildly scary parts - for example when Aslan is being led to his death - are not too needlessly drawn out.Part of the beauty of this film is the casting of the children.  C.S. Lewis's approach to children was one that, in my opinion, produces healthy and well-rounded adults.  In his autobiography \"Surprised by Joy\" he discusses the lack of \"play\" during his schooling.  This is different from organised games, it simply means \"play\".  It is the sort of \"play\" that went on to produce the Narnia classics so many children continue to enjoy today, both in book form and film.The same idea of \"play\" is what essentially happens in this story.  Four bored children attempt to relieve their boredom through an organised game of hide and seek.  This is until they find a far better diversion: the wardrobe.  No organisation by adults - just pure fun.The underlying message of the substitutionary atonement of Christ in the death and resurrection of Aslan is not lost in this film.  It is obvious to anyone with any knowledge of this essential theme of the Gospel.\n",
      "It is wonderful to watch a movie of good moral character that is so professionally done.  The message of death and resurrection is the best story of all ages, and this movie illustrares it well.\n",
      "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an incredible film.  I am very proud of Disney for a job well done.  Yes they changed a little bit of the story but the spirit that runs through this adventure is the same.  Where was all the blood and guts, sex and profanity?  There wasn't any.  Do you mean a movie can gross millions and be pure and clean?  Disney took a chance and found out.  I wonder if Hollywood realizes that people are willing to lay out their hard earned dollars for something of value, instead of waisting it on something cheap with no value.  It doesn't take a genius to see the dollar signs they have been missing.  I saw this film seven times in the theater and will recieve the dvd in a day or two.  This film reminded me of memories I had almost forgotten.  Incredible!James of Rural Retreat, Virginia\n",
      "Great book and great movieThis is a book and movie I can watch over and over againA must watch film\n",
      "This was a wonderful movie. It was enjoyable to watch and something the whole family will love. Tilda Swinton did an excellent job playing the White Which and the actors who played the Pevensie children also did a fine job. I would recommend this movie to anybody.\n",
      "I purchased for my grandkids.  It is part of a great set.  My disc arrived in a timely manner in perfect condition.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys adventure and hours of fun for the whole family\n",
      "This has all the elements of a classic fairy tale: the entry into another world through the wall of a closet, a witch who was power to freeze everyone, monsters, animal-like warriors, and the like. The parallel between the death of Astlan the Lion for rescuing the people from the power of the witch, and of Jesus Christ for the rescue of His own from Satan, is obvious.\n",
      "It was great to use when you do a family trip. My children enjoyed it when they waiting on airport or they are onthe car.\n",
      "First, I have to point out a few things...1. I'm sick of people saying things like: \"These kids go off to war with absolutely no training, blah blah blah...\" LOOK! The message is, God (Aslan) can use anybody to do anything. You don't have to have a military background when you have God on your side.2. I saw one person refer to the juice of the fire flower that Father Christmas gives Lucy as \"kool aid.\" First of all, this ignorant person said that Father Christmas didn't look anything like the popular portrayals, and they're right! THAT is because the way he is shown in the movie is the ENGLISH & BRITISH portrayal of Santa Clause (Father Christmas). (It would be weird to have an American Santa Clause in an English setting). SECOND, the ahem...\"kool aid\" is supposed to represent the Blood of Christ and Father Christmas told her it would cure ANY injury, and that's what the Blood of Christ does, it cleanses & heals us.3. THE COMPARISONS TO LOTR... Stop it already! Lord of the Rings was battles, wars blood...blah blah blah. Narnia is pure story and if you absolutely HAVE TO HAVE continuous war or battle scenes and can't handle watching a real story, then here's a solution: WATCH LOTR!4. When you, yourself come to a sexual conclusion of the circumstances between Lucy and Mr. Tumnus.....then who REALLY is the pervert? Is that the kind of conclusion YOU draw from this innocent setting? That is not the way C.S. Lewis or Andrew Adamson intended.5. The people say that they can't stand watching a movie with Christian allegories...here's another solution: DON'T WATCH THEM! Nobody is forcing you to watch this movie! Christians (like myself) love the fact that C.S. Lewis had the guts to write it in this sin filled world and Andrew Adamson had the guts to direct it (in which a way, I might add, that didn't slam a Bible in your face). If you don't like Christian themes, don't watch it.Other than that, the movie is fabulous. Aslan looks amazing, every single actor did a fantastic job and I can't wait for the next 6 to come out. Prince Caspian is next but, I'm waiting for the Silver Chair.\n",
      "Although Narnia is far from my favorite genre of a film its a really good movie none the less,as for the the blu ray version all I can say is way to go Disney.Maybe it doesn't have all the special features as the four disc released previously but there is plenty here to keep you busy.Now to the nuts and bolts of the blu ray release,what most wonder most.Is this a good blu ray? Is it really worth the price to have on blu ray.Well if your like me and you enjoy terrific looking blu's with some great audio then yes,yes,yes.I'm thinking of some of the better looking blu rays I own and watched and I'm thinking of some of the greats in the video quality like Swordfish yes Swordfish if you enjoy the best blu ray quality than Swordfish in my opinion is probly the best in terms of video quality.Lets see then there is I Robot,Kingdom Of Heaven,Flyboys,Troy,Blood Diamond to name a few.All these I consider to be some of if not the best demo video material for Blu ray disc.Now we have Narnia and Narnia meets or beats any of the above stated blu disc for quality,the the video is what you expect a \"HD\" disc to look like plain and simple.There is so many brilliant colors and nice epic settings in this movie and Disney did one fine job for the blu ray realease.The audio has one of my personel favorite audio tracks the 5.1uncompressed and its done well here also.I know its alot for me to go on typing about here considering Narnia isn't my favorite genre of films but this is a blu ray that does indeed deserve the respect.\n",
      "As a child, I always loved the book \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", but never read the other books.  I started reading the books all at once finaly about a few years ago, and totaly fell in love with them.  So after tollerating three years of \"Ring\" movies, I had mixed fellings when I heard that C.S. Lewis was finaly getting a movie.  But as I loved the books so much, I had some hopes.  As the time got closer and I saw more of the film in trailers or what not, it started to intrest me more.  But after a lot of just bad films the last few years that I had high hopes for, I thought it best not rest my hopes on a new movie now.  And then after the mind blowing \"Batman Begins\", I thought I had seen about the best that 2005 had to offer at the movies.  But when I finaly saw \"Narnia\", all I could say was \"Batman who?\"  It was so amazing!  I loved how they kept true to the books, adding elements from all seven books a a whole to the film.  (Such as the name \"Jadis\" is never used in the book \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\", but they still use it in the movie.  It is writen that is the Witches name in another book.)  And I loved how they had something for everyone, how they stayed true the the Christianity of the book, and yet even if you don't belive in Christ, you could still get into it.  The music was so wonderful, and I loved that for the most part, it was all new actors basicaly.  I fully enjoyed the film and highly recomend it to anyone who loves a good movie.  But read the book first, you will like it that much better!\n",
      "Just to let those of you that do not know this.  There has been a lot of word that Disney is going to do to this movie what New Line did with the Lord of the Rings movies. Later this year there is probably going to be an extended directors cut of the movie.  If you don't care about that then just disregard this or if you have to have both versions then you can also disregard this...but for the rest of you just wanted to give you a heads up on this.\n",
      "I was taking a risk by ordering used bc I can't see it til arruves and it paid off. In awesome shape. NO scratches on dvd and it came quick. I love narnia so for the price I couldn't beat it.\n",
      "They did a fantastic job with this film.  I've read all the books, except this one, and I've seen many of the old versions they put on film.Although I'm not a religious person, this story is still a great one.\n",
      "For those who have yet to decide whether to buy this (the Disney) version or the original BBC version, you need to understand that the Disney version of this C. S. Lewis classic is a high-quality production with superior acting, animation, set design and graphics.  The BBC version, at the same price, is a complete rip-off.  If you really want to enjoy this classic film, don't waste your time with the BBC garbage version.\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia: the Loin, the Witch, and the WardrobeSometimes there are those movies where you have seen the preview and you know you're going to absolutely hate it. Theres always a weekend in every month where my family has a going out to the movies day. Well my little brother got to choose our movie this particular weekend and this was exactly what I thought. I saw the preview to The Chronicles of Narnia and jumped straight to the conclusion that this would be another one of those kid movies with horrible effects and no storyline at all. I even brought my ipod to play games during the movie to keep myself occupied. Well I was completely mistaken. This movie takes you on a big adventure with a great crossing of animation and actuality, young actors and actresses that put on a great performance, and an amazing plot based much on Christianity. This is definitely one of those movies where you would rather hold your number one till the credits show up.First off, most of the time I hate movies that try to combine reality and animation. Movies like Space Jam, and Who Framed Rodger Rabbit just extremely annoy me. But the quality of work that producers Adamson and Minkowski put together resembles very much to the animation of Jurassic Park and Transformers. The animation is so realistic you never really notice throughout the film that half the characters are just CGI and voices. I also enjoyed the different types of creatures that were created in this movie. Its not your average griffins and dragons type of creatures. These creators actually go out and make their own original types of animals, some being normal animals we are used to, but there are also some creative new animals I have never seen before that really impressed me. You do not usually see that in films like this. The scenery is beautiful and also well used with the computer characters. I am pretty sure some of it is animation as well, but honestly I would not be able to tell you which is fake or which is actual land. The way the actors and animation characters move and interact with the scenery is almost identical. This is usually my big pet peeve with crossing animation and reality movies, but these guys have obviously put in the hours to make it right. Overall, I am greatly impressed with the visual effects in this film.Another thing that shocked me in this film were the young actors. They all seemed to be new, I had never seen them before in any other films. Im not completely sure if they have done previous work, but it definitely resembled it. You can tell this movie expected a lot out of these kids and without a doubt pulled it off. They are also quite comical in some scenes when they are first introduced to the \"fantasy\" creatures.  Another plus is that the actors and actresses are all british. This just makes them more fun to watch when they talk in my opinion. Now obviously they are no Leo DiCaprio's or Halle Berry 's, but they really put on a show with this film. Again, overall I really enjoyed the performance by this fresh group of kids.The final part of this film that really made it a keeper was the plot. Being a Christian this movies  showed me that you can tell God's story in so many different ways. The antagonist in the movie extremely portrays the devil in many scenes. There are times where she will tempt the main characters with either food or power. She makes one of the protagonists (Edmond) almost betray his own family just for the glory and power this evil character offers him.  After realizing what he has done he falls into the great chains of sin. Later after committing sin, Edmond is released back to his family after the main protagonist (Aslyn) offers his life as a trade. This act completely resemble Jesus dying on the cross for forgiveness of our sins. But knowing the Gospel, we soon find out of his resurrection to come back and defeat the evil force that is hungry for all the power she can get. You also have to give it up to the actors for there bravery in being a part of such a big production. It takes a lot of courage to share your faith in front of the media like this, and I applaud them for it. The best part about this plot is that it is not advertised as a Christian based film. So many people who don't know Christ have gone to see it unknowing of its meaning. So I am greatly impressed with its sort of secret type of evangelism, because honestly thats what Christianity is all about. Spreading the word of God to others. The workers behind this film have done an exceptional job of this. You cant help but give these guys a big pat on the back.So for all you people who are just like me, taking a look at this preview and automatically thinking this is just another poorly made kids movie, you're greatly mistaken. Though I am sure your kids will greatly enjoy it as well. It has it all, action, drama, comedy, love, you name it. This film takes you on an wild adventure, and will amaze you with the story it has to tell regardless of your age honestly. The cross animation with reality is incredible, these brand new actors and actresses put on such a great performance, and the plot based on Christianity is purely brilliant. I was definitely blown away at the theaters and couldn't wait for the DVD to come out. I also have no doubt that this movie  has done great evangelistic work and maybe even lead some people to the Lord Jesus Christ.\n",
      "As a Narnia fan from way back I swore I would never see this movie because I did not want to see Narnia through someone else's imagination.  I wavered when both my sister and my mother gave it a thumbs up.  C. S. Lewis was still alive when our family first became acquainted with Narnia.  We were in England for the summer and an auntie gave us The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, which my folks took turns reading read outloud to us. Of course, we ended up devouring all seven of the novels.If you are a fan of Narnia and deviations will bother you, then this is probably a good one to skip.  There are many deviations, the biggest one being the overall tone.  The circumstances are simply not as dire as in the book.  This is a kinder, gentler Narnia, and is perfect for the age range of the targeted viewers.  I found myself viewing it as a stunningly beautiful film with a plot I already knew.  By removing most of the violence, gore, and scariness the producers have given birth to a wonderful film for children.I think it is a mistake to cram all of the events in a novel into a two+ hour film.  Instead, the script writers and producers chose to do selected bits of the novel, and to do them very well.One of the tenets of my childhood, which I hope I have instilled in my own children, is \"the worst thing you can do is betray someone who is trusting you.\"  This, and many other ideals come out in this film.In the dedication to his godchild Lucy, C.S. Lewis expressed his regret that Lucy was too old for fairy tales and commented that \"children grow faster than books.\" He went on to express his wish that Lucy read and enjoy The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe when she became old enough for fairy tales again.  I enjoyed them at age eight, again in college, and now again while my own children are in college.\n",
      "My grandaughters were reading this in school and were so interested, that I rented the movie.  They are 11 and 7.  They were thrilled with the movie.  Watching it together, I was able to be sure they understood the backround of the children's trip to rural Great Britain.  It is a mystery, adventure, a dark age, science fiction, story about good and evil in the world.  I ended up ordering the next book for them to read.\n",
      "\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  It's really good, the music is amazing, and I read the book recently and found that the movie is fantastically close to C.S. Lewis' original story.  I am very pleased with Walden Media, and I applaud them for their fantastic job.  I could go on and on with compliments for this film, but, for several reasons, I won't.I am very pleased with the product itself; it includes a slip with the scene selection on it, and it has commentary and bloopers if you want to experience the film a bit more.  I received this edition of the film as a birthday present last year, although I saw it for the first time in January 2008.  I am really happy to own this film.\n",
      "Very Good Movie this is really a great movie for the whole family or just the kids. You will love it\n",
      "I just watched the movie in Widescreen format. It was very good. It is not perfect, but the movie is a far more faithful adaptation than I ever expected from anything associated with Disney. The movie is charming. The kids put in very good performnaces. Aslan was well done in CGI. Neesan provided a very kingly voice. Swinton is good as the White Witch.The DVD had a pop-up feature. Fun facts about Lewis and Narnia pop up in little balloons throughout the movie. Some of the facts were incongruous with what was happening with the movie. The fact that Lewis was very concerned with good manners in children appeared too many times. However, it was an okay feature. I would give this movie 4 1/2 stars. I would knock a 1/2 star off because I disagree with some of the minor changes, but again I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and am very impressed with the final result. It has more depth and charm than most children movies I have seen lately. I can't wait for \"Prince Caspian.\"\n",
      "Wow, this was so well done. The child actors were perfect, the CGI creatures were perfect, the soundtrack... again, perfect (except for the pop music during the credits).A magical fairy tale, a metaphor for \"The Greatest Story Ever Told.\"  Yes, the Gospel story used to be called this, modern critics would strongly disagree with this outdated sentiment. (Perhaps they'll award this title to \"The DaVinci Code?\") The strongest critics of C.S. Lewis' book and this mostly faithful movie are generally those who hate Christian belief.Yet consider, many stories borrow Gospel elements... including the epic \"E.T.\"If you're not Christian, no harm, no foul!  This fairy tale has adventure, humor, beauty, tragedy and triumph. You WILL enjoy it, and your inner child with smile for days.Jeff Messenger, the author of \"The Shroud of Torrington.\"\n",
      "Watched this with my little girls, 19 and 8 and their cousins, both boys 15 and 21, everybody loved the movies but of course we were all familiar with the books. These are great movies for families, but read the book first. Reepicheep is a new favorite in my house...LOL\n",
      "Chronicles isn't another word for trilogy, so if you're in fear of waiting years for resolution like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, or the Star Wars pre-trilogy, don't worry. This movie is complete and stands alone. Sort of like the first Star Wars, or I mean the forth(it's confusing trying to figure out where star wars starts) I loved this film for what it wasn't: A tinsley movie geared down from the category of 'family' to 'childrens'. It certainly has the feel and sometimes the look of more mature works. The landscape camera shots felt like some of the shots of New Zealand from Lord of the Rings; hey, it' aint broke so.... No surprise that some of those responsible for that classic trilogy are apart of this one. But this movie is so much more than borrowed materials and used cliches. It's a great family movie and it drives you into an exploring state of mind. I truely shifted through the wardrobe. It was an intimate transition at first. The furs of the coats brushing the camera and the pace was like a peaceful stroll past a pond. I loved a certain feel this movie had. The tip-toeing of the fawn, the evolving luminosity on the childrens faces mirroring the awakening of the fairy tale land. The child in me broke free and ran around in my head until it collapsed like when I use to play with frenzy.\n",
      "Perfect! No complaints. The movie plays all the way through with absolutely no scratches or glitches. The movie is also very good, I must say, if you haven't seen it.\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia has been my favorite book series for as long as I can remember.  Everytime I read it I see things I previously missed and enjoy it that much more.  Therefore, when I learned they were making a movie of it, I was thrilled - but anxious to see if the story would be modified for hollywood or kept true to the way CS Lewis wrote it.I was pleased with the outcome.  The movie is true to the book, with a few adaptations to help with the movie flow, but the most important parts weren't changed.  I thought the characters were portrayed well and the actors well chosen for each role.  Liam Neeson's voice for Aslan is perfect, as it has a calm gentleness but appropriate firmness which truly brings the character to life as CS Lewis describes him in the book.  The imagery in the movie was spectacular, as were the special effects.  I was impressed with the way they did the scene when Lucy first goes into Narnia, I really felt like I was entering Narnia with her.The Christian influence to the story was evident to me, showing not simply good vs. evil, but true sacrifice for another person's \"treason\".  However, I don't think it is preacy so as to prevent non-Christians from enjoying a good movie.Finally, I agree with the reviewers that say it isn't too violent.  Like other good vs. evil movies by Disney (Sleeping Beauty, the Lion King, Bambie, Snow White, etc), there are characters that are scary, but not overdone.I could go on, but many reviewers have said so much.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and look forward to buying the DVD when it comes out.  I hope Disney does the whole series of the Chronicles of Narnia...if they are all this good, it will be 7 movies I thoroughly enjoy!\n",
      "I really enjoyed this movie. I have read almost all the books and I went to see this in the theaters. Overall, this is a great movie, and I was SO PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AND AMAZED AT THE INCREDIBLE GRAPHICS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Aslan,(the lion) The griffin, and the beavers were so realistic, everything was, actually.and the storyline is great! It is based on the events that take place in the Bible, like, in the 1st book the Magician's nephew(they haven't made a movie about that)The evil Queen, Jadis(Better known as the White Witch in THe Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe)eats of a forbidden apple. Then, ( in this movie) to cover Edmund's sins, Aslan lets the white Witch kill him, but then he rises from the dead, and the stone table, (the place they killed him)cracks in half, just like the curtain ripped.All in all it is a great movie and the acting surprised me. IT is very well done, and NOT AT ALL like the other 2 dollar movies you can rent, where the beavers and all the animals are just people dressed in suits. This was all computer-animated(Except of course the kids and adults and train and most scenery)so it's not like a cartoon. SO REALISTIC!!!!!!!! You have to buy it!!!!!\n",
      "It was excellent! Perfect for my 8 year old and adults. Have not read all of the books, but seeing this has inspired me to read them.\n",
      "I've never read the original artwork by C.S. Lewis, so my review can by no means assess how true the movie actually is to the original. My kids mildly enjoy this movie and I find it quite interesting. `Narnia' is a good film due to the books and not something that can be credited to the movie's producers. The fantasy and the power of magic that pervades the story might make any child's eyes gleam in admiration and amazement. This needs to be appreciated and makes `Narnia' a nice Christmas movie as well.The characters are somewhat indifferent, save for little Lucy played by Georgie Henley. The remaining three siblings -- Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Peter (William Moseley), and Susan (Anna Popplewell) also done a good job as well but their characters wasn't as convincing as Lucy's. The two male actors in particular seem a bit overcharged with the movie's scope. They act decently in a way that would definitely suffice for a movie of lesser dimension. This is probably due to a lack of sophistication in terms of the kids' acting skills. Maybe the casting department should have chosen more experienced actors instead of utter newcomers but they had to start somewhere. I can imagine what a challenge it was to process something as huge as Lewis' `Narnia.' It seems to me that the producers wanted to jam as much input into the story as possible, which hampered the natural development of the plot. How can you expect the two boys being good at fighting with their swords in a huge battle? Why are the main characters rejuvenated when they re-enter the wardrobe? In addition some scenes were indeed very corny and too stereotypical for me - even young kids can expect a bit more. The deep emotions were not really influential, which brings me back to the inexperienced actors. What save `Narnia' was the magic of it all. Talking animals, beautiful landscapes, funny dialogs, themes of redemption and courage - this is something to be appreciated, as it might inspire children and adults alike. The movie is an eye-catcher in terms of wonderful visualizations that does justice to Lewis' perception of `Narnia.'\"The Chronicles of Narnia\" is a unique story that had room for improvement, but hopefully they can work at it the second time around. Still, with intense battle scenes, menacing encounters with the witch and her minions, and the seemingly fatal injuries suffered by major characters, it seems to me that this film pushes its PG rating to the limits but who am I to judge.\n",
      "The first time my wife asked me to watch this movie I was hesitant, but I enjoyed it.After the second and third time it grew on me and I'm glad we purchased it.\n",
      "This movie was so beautifully done and a real modern family classic, so we're holding out for the Extended version for our bluray libary. I hope we don't turn blu holding our breath for that.\n",
      "This movie was absolutely amazing. Held me captive the entire time.  Visuals were tremendous. Go see this movie with your family. Awesome.\n",
      "Uber nerd that I am, I purchased the regular and extended versions of the film (similar to my LOTR collection).  If I had to choose between the two, the extended version wins hands down.  With more special features, and a really nice looking case, it's worth the extra couple of dollars.  As for the film itelf, this was a wonderfully made movie.  It stayed true to C.S. Lewis' books and the animation was state of the art.  I also liked the parallel between Aslan and Jesus, and it was as emotionally stirring as the Passion of the Christ.  A great way to show the Christian story to an audience of children.\n",
      "this is the first one in a set of three. I love this movie and would recommend all three dvd's.A must for any collection. ♥`•..•'`•.•♥\n",
      "I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I did the first time I saw it.  However the Blu-ray is a very nice transfer and if you're a fan of the film, it won't disappoint.  It's a very nice upgrade from the dvd.\n",
      "fyi, This refers to the one-disc \"Full Screen\" Edition with the truncated image format. But I'm making this review based on the theatrical version before the DVD is released.  I'll do another one once I get my copy...(If you like the story and you've not seen this \"on the big screen\" go now before it's to late!  You'll kick yourself later if you don't.)** When you watch this movie; listen for the music. The sound track by Harry Gregson Williams is simply stunning!Bold orchestrations, strong choir, some subtle unconventional instrumentation, and careful thematic development define this score as one of the best.A score is like the emotional brain of a movie. It conducts, and cues the audience feelings; Carrying the emotion of the story at each moment. It subconsciously joins with the visuals, going straight to the viewers' heart.A musical score can make or break a movie.  It can rescue a bad movie, or ruin a good movie.But a good movie with a good score is magic.. And that is what we have here.In my opinion Harry Gregson-Williams is one of the great film score composers, with talent that is both broad and deep.Visually, the movie totally works. Overall the cinematography, editing, modeling, animation, and compositing are superb..Flawless?  Never. All movies have flaws.  Watch this for the classic story first. And then watch it again if you want to break from the story a bit, and you may see a few minor compositing mistakes, and a couple of animation goofs.  All easily forgivable, in my opinion.We all loved this movie, especially the kids.  Most of us cried when the witch killed Aslan, and let out some boo-yah's and yes's, when we saw that Aslan knew more than the witch, and was resurrected through \"a deeper magic\".There are some bloodless battle scenes (check out the griffins!). And some scariness with the White Witch.  It is rated PG; So some of the younger or more sensitive kids may need help through the scarier parts.After you've seen this movie, you won't need to watch the rising $281,934,379 box office take (second only to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) to know; This one's a winner!On a different note; It seems a crime, but somehow they think it's a good idea to sell these \"Full Screen\" versions where the image is truncated...  If you buy the \"Full Screen\" version you will loose half the effect; Get the wide screen version and you'll see it all!\n",
      "This is of course the best of the Narnia series!!!! It introduces us to all the Pevensie children and the begining ofthe story. The actors are just perfect for their parts!!!!!!!!! Great acting and what a great story!! I never read anyof the Narnia books as a child so I have nothing to compare it to but it was just a wonderful story. I love the symbolismof the story and messages that are so carefully laid out throughout the film!!!!! It is filled with strong acting!Wherever they found these actors--the Pevensie children---was a lucky find for the film. All the actors are great! Lovedthe White Witch---she was fanastic!!!!I love the battle between good and evil, the betrayal from the brother Edmund, andthen the Savior. I think all three of the Narnia movies have been underrated and overshadowed by other films especially theHarry Potter. Everything has been overshadowed by Harry Potter!!!!! It's not the only film out there and not the best!!!\n",
      "stunning picture(reference)quality, and soundgood storyline(a bit childish but that,s okA perfect film for the whole familya must have in your blu ray libery\n",
      "Well done movie I just hope that they come out with the other books as well.\n",
      "The author C.S. Lewise is a great writer in history and a great Christcian. We bought all 7 Narnia books and all 3 movies came out so far. This movie is the best among all three. I watched this movie with my two boys many many times. We all truely enjoy it -- not only the amzaing imagination of C.S. Lewise, the wonderful acting, great pictures but more importantly, tips for life with wisdom. We are looking forward to see the next movie that suppose to come out this year.\n",
      "While I enjoyed this film and don't agree with all the quibbling over minor alterations necessary in adapting a book into a film, or the alleged religious tone - which might be there if you go looking for it - I'm left wondering why we now have a four disc extended set. There have been two sets already. I realize double-dipping is a way to get fans to fork out more money (like the myriad Lord of the Rings sets have been doing), but is it good? Empty profiteering aside, think of the resources wasted and landfill needed to take up older versions. Our environmental responsibility should affect decisions of commerce and consumption. Would the creator of Narnia be in favor of unfettered greed and environmental custodial abdication?\n",
      "Lewis wrote something for everyone.  The Chronicles help youth understand charity, forgiveness, sacrifice and death as ideas not to be feared. This film is a great telling of the story.\n",
      "I have the whole Chronicles of Narnia series in one book and read The Magician's Nephew and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The Magician's Nephew probably should've been made a movie. Since it comes first and shows the creation of Narnia, how the animals talk and how the witch got there and how the lamp post even got there. Starting off with everything already there might confuse people who never read the books.I think since I read the book, it's why I enjoyed the movie so much. But if you haven't you'll be entertained but think the movie is uneven and should explain stuff like how the witch got there and how she got in power. Anyway although those things should've probably been included, this is a very very faithful adaption of the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. It's what it should be like and is pretty much everything I read from the story. I mean the things that are missing aren't from this story, are from the story before it. So this can't be called a bad adaption at all. I guess those critics who gave it ** or ** 1/2 didn't read the books because this is the book about 95%.Even the casting of Tilda Swinton as the Witch, is just brilliant. She is the part and just the way you'd picture her while reading. The special effects are perfect and should be nominated. The Lion looks great and is sometimes hard to believe he is computer animated. Liam Neeson is well fit to talk for him as well. Like I said Magician'ss Nephew should've been made so people who never read the books know what's going on. Still though the movie is enjoyable either way.A lot of reviews are even calling the film a yawn. Even Ebert who gave it *** used the word \"yawn\" in his review header. I don't see how the movie is a yawn at all. Even when you think it will drag on, it doesn't. The movie goes pretty smoothly and isn't boring at all. There's enough wonder and entertainment to keep your attention through-out. Critics are the boring ones. They can sit through a boring 2 hour and 20 minute drama with no complaints. But when a fantasy is 2 hours and 20 minutes with action, adventure and wonder, they call it a yawn ? I doubt all the people clapping afterwards thought it was a yawn. The movie had so many loud and thrilling moments that it should've probably have been PG-13. So no way should the word \"yawn\" be used to explain this movie. I only think it was probably a little too violent to be PG and the kids voices can be annoying from time to time lol. Those are about my only complaints though.\n",
      "Whole family enjoyed this movie from the 7year old to the 40 year old. 2 1/2 hours but flew by fast.\n",
      "I absolutely love this movie, and don't have children but believe that this would be great way to explain sin and forgiveness to a child.  Loved it!\n",
      "I was surprised that the case was clear. It was damaged. Disk is fine.Movie was good.\n",
      "The Lion, the Witch, and the WardrobeI read this book as a teenager, learning of Lewis from my passion for Tolkien. The book totally fascinated me then, and made me hungry for more. I remember reading a few more of the books in the series, and though I enjoyed them, I never did find the original magic in them that this one inspired. I lost one of the books or two and never completed the series, but years later I returned to it in order to read them to my step-son, and now I'm very glad to have read the whole series in it's entirity.First off, this and the first book are absolutely the best ones. This time we started with the first book, which I think is named \"The Magician's Nephew,\" and I daresay that as an adult I enjoyed it even MORE than \"Wardrobe.\" The origins of the breach into Narnia and the original sin that freed the witch were fascinating to me.But returning to \"Wardrobe\" was a true delight. Now that I can better digest the symbolism and glean more from the story with the added info learned from \"Nephew,\" the book claimed a new tantalizing power over me. My step-son enjoyed it immensely, and couldn't wait to have another chapter read to him each night for bedtime.As an adult I am now able to better appreciate Lewis's incredible talent for character developement and symbolism, as well as his strong imagination and elegant writing style. The rest of the books were also great, and I'm happy to have finally gotten around to reading them all. Certainly the least in the \"Narnia\" series is far and above the vast majority of children's chapter books. But for me, the first two are by far the best, approaching the status of even 'The Hobbit,\" and from me that is saying worlds.I was delighted to find that just as I was reading the series again, the movie was in production. I think the movie was a great rendition of the book, well directed with excellent actors and excellent special effects. Of course it didn't include or capture everything in the book, but hey, it's a movie. They did alot better job of it than most movie renditions of popular books or stories. I really hope they continue the series through the entire span of the books.J. Lyon LaydenThe Other Side of Yore\n",
      "This is a great movie and you won't be disappointed.  I'm hoping for a sequal!\n",
      "My kids watch this movie over and over on their Blu-Ray player and do not get bored from it.  I myself enjoy watching the movie as it is action packed and contains a good moral message for the kids.\n",
      "I too read this book as a child and though it was one of my favorites, I don't remember word for word what the book said, like some of you can.  When I saw the previews for the movie, I was excited and couldn't wait to see it and in fact, saw it TWICE when it did come out.  I loved it that much.  So when have any of you \"haters\" read a book and had the movie match up exactly???  So they changed some things around, so what.  The movie was still great and it still made perfect sense.  All the memories came flooding back to me as I watched it whether it was all word for word or not.  The story line still gave CS Lewis the credit for creating such a wonderful story.I thought the animation and the acting were superb and the costumes and filming locations were outstanding!!!  I can't wait for April 4th when it comes out.  I loved it and will continue to watch it for a VERY long time to come.\n",
      "Narnia is a fun movie for my whole family.  I waited until my kids were a little older to watch since there are some scary parts but they both loved it!\n",
      "Ther were no problems with the DVD or the time with which arrived. That is why I rated it so high\n",
      "Making a live action film adaptation of The Lion, the Witch, the Wardrobe is a risky venture.  Sure, there are legions of fans of the Narnia series but there are mythical creatures and talking animals and children who are heroes.  This is such an easy novel to mess up and make a really cheesy movie with bad special effects.  Like Gollum in Lord of the Rings, if Aslan did not succeed the film itself would have failed utterly.Fortunately, Aslan does work on screen and the cheese factor is quite low.  The children do a fine job and the CG effects are excellent.  The world is brighter than Middle Earth, but Narnia looks fully realized on screen.The story is a fairly simple one, four children in war torn England are sent to a relative's home to stay so they are not at risk from bombings.  While playing in the house they discover a wardrobe which harbors a secret: out of the back of the wardrobe is some sort of a portal to a different wintery world: Narnia.  Narnia is ruled by the White Witch and is permanent winter until the return of Aslan.  These children are foretold in prophecy and will have a major role to play in the future of Narnia.The story is simple.  It could be viewed as a typical fantasy stet up.  But because C.S. Lewis was also a Christian writer there is a very strong Christian overtone (or underpinning) if you know what you are looking for.  It is there, but it is not overwhelming.Rated PG, this film is toned down for children.  The battles are nothing like that of Braveheart or Lord of the Rings, and yet this does not feel as if it were a children's movie.  Well made.  Well acted, even by the children.  Well done.There are a slew of bonus features on the two disc DVD: Bloopers, multiple commentary tracks, documentaries and features on the making of Narnia (including a focus on Lewis himself), and the creatures and legends of Narnia.  This is a very complete DVD for the fan of the film and the novels.-Joe Sherry\n",
      "I bought this movie as a reward for my students upon completion of the book The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe.  They truly enjoyed it and the movie was in excellent condition.\n",
      "I love all the Chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis. The impact that it has had on my life cannot be described. Let's just say that it stirs up the wonder and the majestics of a life filled with grace.\n",
      "these movies are delightful and insightful for the viewer to go deeper in thematic content. Well done, colorful,  and enjoyable\n",
      "Because this was good. The kids are charming, despite a little stiffness. The sfx are great. And the movie looks good.\n",
      "The WaldenMedia version of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe was superb in almost every way.  The only regret I had was the trimming down of the resurrection of Aslan.  Its overall impact compared to earlier filmed versions does not rest solely with modern CGI.  Rather, it was the involvement of C.S. Lewis' own stepson Douglas Gresham.  Gresham has been a faithful guardian of not just the content of Lewis' work but also their spirit.  His participation benefitted the production enormously.  With that said, let me encourage those who have the theatrical release that the extended footage is certainly worth the asking price.  Even without the featurette on Lewis' life and other goodies, the battle scenes were paced better and more compelling.  Other additions will mainly interest those who have watched the theatrical release on DVD many times over as they point and say \"Aha!  There it is!\".  Still, nothing was disruptive or irritating.  The additional footage was carefully chosen and well integrated.  I was extremely pleased.\n",
      "i really enjoyed all of these books as a kid and i totally apprecaite the way this was made into a movie.\n",
      "I came late to the Chronicles of Narnia, not having read them until adulthood, and they have always lacked the sparkle that J.R.R. Tolkien's works have for me. Nevertheless they are enchanting stories in their own right, and I have read them several times and enjoyed them for themselves and for their symbolism as well.  When the movie of The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe opened I saw it with some reluctance, fearing that once again any magic might be diluted by my age.I was absolutely wrong.  The Lion, The Witch,and The Wardrobe is an enchanting, incredibly appealing movie which demonstrates the full beauty and grandeur of Narnia, undiluted by my adult eyes and enriched by the symbolism.  There's an innocence and beauty to Narnia which the movie well captures through its lovely scenery and fine actors.  That same innocent beauty is what appeals to me about Tolkien's Shire, which I felt Peter Jackson, magnificent though his Lord of the Rings films are, never really completely caught on screen.There are critics of this movie and of Lewis who attack the Christian symbolism, and there are people who call themselves Christian who misinterpret this movie (and Lewis himself) in order to advance their own social/political agendas.  What I love about Lewis and this movie is that they portray the story behind Christianity so that we see it in its ideal form and not as some prefer to twist it.\n",
      "C.S. Lewis's \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" with its seven allegorical books is becoming the latest film franchise. This first movie based upon the second book in the series is filled with talking animals and mythical creatures like centaurs, satyrs, fauns, gryphons, dwarfs, a wicked albino witch, and four charming and innocent British school kids. The movie is entertaining, but it does not seem to resonate with any great significance or meaning despite Lewis's reputation as a Christian polemicist.The four siblings who have been evacuated from the London blitz during War II are staying with a rich man in his country mansion. The youngest, a girl, travels to the snowy land of Narnia by entering a magic wardrobe. She meets a faun and the wicked witch. The most important creature in Narnia is Aslan, the lion.The film is entertaining, well-cast and well-acted, has some great special effects as well as a few hokey ones, the voices of some famous stars, but there's no there there; it lacks the underpinning of a substantive reason for being.William Mosely who plays the older brother is every teenage girl's heartthrob. It's a fun movie for kids as well as adults who'll get a kick out anthropomorphic animals and mythological creatures. Holds your interest.\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe had many great special effects. I think it stayed very close to C.S. Lewis' original story. Four children get dragged into a conflict between good and evil. The lion in Narnia symbolized Jesus.\n",
      "themovie was great played like it was brand new very happy camper i will buy more movies thank u very much\n",
      "\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" is one of the best fantasy films I have seen in recent years, eclipsed in its grandeur and cinematic scope only by Peter Jackson's acclaimed \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy (I might also add too that I've enjoyed \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" much more than any of the \"Harry Potter\" films.). Like Jackson, director Adam Adamson also draws upon the New Zealand landscape in his cinematic depiction of Narnia, and the film's cinematography is close to the high standards established in \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. Much to my pleasant surprise, \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" is a very faithful adaptation of the C. S. Lewis literary classic; Adamson's slight improvements - most notably the opening sequence of London under attack by Nazi Germany Luftwaffe bombers at night - merely fleshes out some of the intriguing backstory which Lewis himself had omitted.The cast is truly spectacular, with excellent performances from the four children who will lead Narnia to spring and freedom from the century-old oppressive rule of Jadis, the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton): Lucy Pevensie (Georgie Henley), Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keynes), Peter Pevensie (William Moseley), and Susan Pevensie (Anna Popplewell). Indeed, Georgie Henley's Lucie is so fascinating a character that she nearly steals every scene she is in, along with Anna Popplewell's Susan. But I found most beguiling, Tilda Swinton's icy portrayal of Jadis, the wicked White Witch and self-styled Queen of Narnia. Other notable performances include James McAvoy's Mr. Tumnus, the faun, Jim Broadbent's Professor Kirke, and especially, Liam Neeson's Aslan. The CGI is surprisingly not up to \"The Lord of the Rings\" standards, but is still quite good, with some of the best work set aside for Aslan, Narnia's regal lion and leader of the forces of good. \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" is one of the most impressive films I have seen this year, worthy of interest for children of all ages, regardless of whether they have or have not read C. S. Lewis's literary classic series \"The Chronices of Narnia\".\n",
      "The Cronicles of Narnia- the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe  is the best movie I have seen this year!The movie is well done all  the actors did  a awsome  job ! If you have  read the books ( like i  did)you  will  find that the  movie is the same as  the  book but just a few  added  sceans..(which I liked )If you  that this is just a  kids movie ,than your wrong . My parents my Grandparents all  loved the movie and you  will  love it  too . This  movie has  everything  from  action to drama to comode .To tell  the truth I  have  seen  this  movie 4 times .The movie is  about 4  young English kids going to stay with a  profecer after England is bombed . they arive at the  profecers house to find an old maid who  is always on there back . To pas  the time  the  kids play hide and go  seek . Lucy the young'est of the four finds in  one  room a wardwrode ,so she  get in to hide and  finds out that  shes in  another  world that is in  winter  time .As she  looks  around so is  amaized by  what  she  sees and cant believe how big the wordrobe is ! ( she  only like 6 to 7 years old )But as  she  is  looking  arounf  she  hears  something  and  looks behind her to  see coming right from behind a  tree a  Faun . But  Lucy didn't know what it was  so she Naturaly screemed and so the  faun screems too droping the  bags  that  he  had .SO then Lucy walks over  to  the  Faun picks up the bags and  gives them to the faun . At firts the faun  doesn't know what to  think of the  girl... he  asks her  if shes a  tall daworfe or something . SO TO MAKE A  LONG STORY  SHORT !!!!!youfind out that the fauns name is  Mr. Tumnus and lucy finds out that  she is  NOT in  a  wardrobe but in  the land or Narnia .But I  think  this  movie  is one of the best and  a must buy .

SO I  hope that you  come to  love this  movie as much as  I do ....\n",
      "It would be difficult to give a \"detailed and specific\" review of this movie without filling it with spoilers -- and this movie is worth seeing fresh. In every detail that matters -- the animation, the live action, the props and costuming, the acting, the casting, the setting, the special features, the delightful commentary by the director and the child actors, and on and on -- this film is first-rate. If the appearance of Father Christmas (the UK's version of Santa Claus) seems a tad disconcerting, remember, it's in C.S. Lewis' original story (as much in the film, strictly speaking, is not).Of course, New Zealand is the perfect setting for so much of this film. One climactic scene near the end (given its geographical setting) just might have fans of THE LORD OF THE RINGS expecting Gandalf, Aragorn or the Riders or Rohan coming in from stage left to smite the White Witch and her minions.\n",
      "What Kid doesn't want to go on an Adventure? As a parent, I got to go on a wonderful adventure with my two children. We first watched the BBC version last year, and they loved the story. They read the books soon after. Even though they knew the story it didn't stop them from enjoying this Version. It is wonderfully made with beautiful scenery and has the viewer's attention all throughout the movie. We will continue to enjoy the adventurers with the Sons and Daughters of Eve and Adam for many years to come\n",
      "I am an enormous fan of C.S. Lewis's (Jack) work regarding Narnia. Reading them as a child lifted me to heights that I will never forget.Now - don't get down on me and trash my review. I loved the film; hence the four star rating. Anyone that has seen the BBC movie released in 1988 or so, understands that there is an enormous difference between the two films. The BBC film was, almost, line-by-line faithful to Lewis' work. Sadly, it wasn't very good. It was excruciatingly slow when it didn't need to be slow. Imagine two minutes of watching fawns and what not simply walk. Ugh. Horrific.This was not a line-by-line rendition of the book. Critics who say it was were on drugs. Today we live in an age where action is more preferable than faithfulness (as seen in the Lord of the Rings), but if the faithfulness is close enough, then we must accept it. I struggled with this viewing, but in the end, I decided that I liked it, that it was close enough in form to Lewis' writing. Sadly, as was Tolkien, Lewis wasn't around to tell us what he thought of it. Many critics have applauded the film for being true to Lewis' work. I can't imagine what they were thinking. Yes, there were the four Pevensies crowned at Cair Paravel. Yes, there was a White Witch (played brilliantly), and yes there was a magnificent lion and very well performed Sons of Adams and Daughters of Eve. Peter, in particular, was marvelous. Edmund, who played both a traitor and a \"good guy\", was intensely believable. He cast well.But there were serious derivations from the book. HOWEVER, this is not a bad thing. Lewis' book was not an action packed book. To turn it into a film, action need to be inserted, and the directors did just that. I'm not speaking only of the battle scene (which did not occur in the book), but rather a number of other events. However, they were all used to add tension to the story, and they didn't take anything away from the story. To speak freely - the action added events did nothing to harm Lewis' story.Initially I was upset at the changes that were made. Now, however, as I've had time to think about it, I can understand why *most* of the changes were made. Personally, I wouldn't have made certain changes - specifically, how Lucy and Edmund ended up in Narnia together. The change from the book to the screen didn't make much sense to me.All that aside, being a Narnia purist, I would love to see more movies, even if the derive a bit from Lewis' telling. This was terrific and magnificent.And Aslan - well, he needed to be perfect, and he was. Kudos to those who drew him. Utterly believable.\n",
      "The genre of fantasy has long been ignored for quite a long time in cinema (especially after a period of hit-and-miss entries in the 1980's), but now it has been heavily revitalized, thanks to the runaway success of both Peter Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and the HARRY POTTER movies. Based on this, it is probably no surprise that another beloved fantasy literature series would get the big screen treatment. And what better choice than C.S. Lewis' enchanting CHRONICLES OF NARNIA? In a surprising collaboration between Disney and Walden Media, the first book in the series, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, hit the theaters in 2005, and went onto become both a critical and popular success. The film may not be a replica of THE LORD OF THE RINGS, but that is hardly its purpose. All it has to do is bring this beloved tale to the screen with a touch of magic and heart, and thanks to the craft of highly advanced special effects and fine performances, it manages to do just that.The story begins in World War II London, where four Pevensie children--Lucy (Georgie Henley), Susan (Anne Popplewell), Peter (William Moseley), and Edmond (Skandar Keynes)--are forced to live in the mansion of an enigmatic professor. During a hide-and-seek game, the children discover a wardrobe which turns out to be a portal to a mysterious magical world called Narnia, a land inhabited by talking beasts and mythical creatures. Unfortunately, this kingdom is under the rule of the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton), who has cursed the entire land to an eternal winter. Only the great lion king, Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), and the children can put an end to her evil reign.The story has been told several times before Disney's rendition. There was an animated feature produced by Bill Melendrez which aired back in the 1970s, and a three-hour long television adaptation courtesy of BBC. Both of these adaptations showed their age in production values, yet remained fairly faithful to the source material. For those of you who fear that Disney's acquisition of NARNIA means a \"Disneyfication\" of a classic story, DON'T. As with Jackson in LORD OF THE RINGS, director Andrew Adamsom shows tremendous respect for the source material, and does a first class job of transitioning it to the big screen without sacrificing its magic or substance. If you're expecting a totally literal adaptation, though, chances are you might be disappointed, because there are a few scenes from the book which are obviously shortened and/or altered, as well as some which were added in. However, none of these \"changes\" compromise the story in any way; the magic of Lewis' world is imperishable, and overall this adaptation is commendably faithful while adding to it in the same way that Jackson's LOTR did.There are a few places where the visual effects, as produced by LOTR's Weta Digital in New Zealand, lack polish, but are otherwise breathtaking, particularly the talking animals (including a pair of gently funny beavers) and especially the climactic showdown. What ultimately makes this NARNIA are the sincere, believable performances courtesy of the excellent cast. Young Georgie Henley as Lucy, in particular, sparkles the screen with a radiant innocence and cuteness without being saccharine. Her siblings acquit themselves fairly well, too, although William Moseley's Peter is a bit on the wooden side. Liam Neeson has the perfect voice for Aslan, while Tilda Swinton oozes both evil and charisma as the White Witch.I'm sure that the ages-old book vs. movie debate will last for eternity (in addition to comparisons to previous filmed versions), but this brand-new NARNIA is still most welcome. It doesn't have the depth or complexity of THE LORD OF THE RINGS, but it does have a special charm and childlike wonder which makes it a treat in its own right. It will be interesting to see how subsequent adaptations of the remaining books in the series will turn out.\n",
      "The grandeur of the landscape and the richness of the charachter's costumes and the special effects are much more observable in blu-ray.  If you liked the movie on DVD or in the theater, you will love it in blu-ray!\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia-The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an excellent movie. Great acting, wonderful production, outstanding special effects, and Andrew Adamson's vision all create a winning formula for Buena Vista Home Entertainment.Though there are violent moments and scenes that are outside the boundaries of a typical children's story, they are nonetheless used to provide a range of both intensity and depth that would appeal to a more adult audience that had just enjoyed the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which the Chronicles has often been compared and contrasted with. Tilda Swinton highlights the suspense as the wicked White Queen in a way that would have many a moviegoer to put her on par with Alice Krige as The Borg Queen from the Star Trek Universe.The movie score accompanies the motion picture quite well. Also noteworthy are Liam Neeson's vocal contributions depicting the brave, kind, war-weary protagonist, the lion known as Aslan.All in all, I am pleased that strong markets exist for good story movies such as this, and I look forward to the The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, which is scheduled for release on May 16, 2008.\n",
      "Hello to every person that is reiding this. This movie is the best epic, Fantasy, Christian, Action pack movie ever made with high tecnology.

My Room is decorated with narnia stuff including The action figures. My Favorite characters of this movie r Aslan,Lucy and most important for me and beautifull is Susan and aslan.

If u want to know more narnia info visit [...] i dont know how to expliain everything i feel for narnia. I LOVE NARNIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! For aslaaaaaaannnnnnnnn!!!!!!!\n",
      "This is a very good movie.  My daughters love it and so do my wife and I.\n",
      "We've read the Narnia series many times in our family.  This first movie (of the series) does a pretty tolerable job of following the story from the book.. a few things left out, a few things put in.. but as a package, the essence of the story remained true.  Sacrifice, redemption.. talking animals.\n",
      "Really liked this recreation of C. S. Lewis' most popular work. It is extremely well done and very tastefully presented (as seems to be lacking in many other book re-creations). I highly recommend!\n",
      "With box office attendance falling, Hollywood has finally caught on. The \"Chonicles of Narnia\" is  a movie in the traditional style. For those of you tired of fractured fairy tales, anti-heroes, slang, dumbed-down dialogue and pop cultural references, flatulence gags, and other such staples of current family-geared movies, this is the movie you have been waiting for. Great visuals, lots of suspense, and a message of hope and sacrifice that is faithful to the book. The cast, writers, producers and director have taken C. S. Lewis' simple, almost wispy allegory and turned it into a vibrant, convincing adventure story.\n",
      "I have loved this book that is now a movie (or another movie) about the Wardrobe.  Though I find it humorous that some don't know that C S Lewis has a writing style that he is talking about The Good News, Yes about Jesus Christ and many don't realize it.  The Lion is a representative of Jesus.  The Lion of Judas He is often referred to.  I am not going to start getting into a doctrinal discussion.  Just wanted to point out what many didn't know.  .\n",
      "Curious, at times, where the screen writer chose to deviate from the book... but nothing that took away from the spirit of the literature. Very well done!Not for sensitive children... while the \"blood and guts\" were played down in the battle sequences, it is still fairly violent and disturbing at times.\n",
      "Being a huge fan of these books, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this film.  The creators stayed true to the tale written by CS Lewis.\n",
      "This is a wonderful movie, my daughter loves it.I usually dont like movies like this but she insisted I watch. I absolutely love it\n",
      "I have been a big Narnia fan for many years!  This movie, and especially this edition, was wonderfully done!  The extra features, including a disk devoted to the author - CSLewis, was great!  Loved it.\n",
      "I don't fully agree with some of the other reviews.  I have read the entire Chronicles of Narnia book set and the more I get into it, the more I find myself trying to imagine what these things would look like if I were faced with them it real life.  I definately think that the movie does this justice!  C. S. Lewis doesn't fully go into certain things that were expanded in the movie and were very well done.  For instance, that fact that the story takes place during the boombing raids on London of WWII.  Also, what would this mysterious place called Narnia look like.  What would the animals look like?  Would it be like things that we are already familiar with?  What would it be like to leave one world where your scared and afraid and faced with a harsh, cruel reality and enter a new world with another reality that is cruel in almost the same way, but in a completely different context.  I think this movie is wonderful in allowing you to forget the special effects and actually try to enter the childhood fantasy of Narnia.  You can't just kind of watch it, you have to completely watch it, in order to fully appreciate it.  Try it and then you can appreciate things like the Mr. & Mrs. Beaver, the wisdom of Aslan, the terror of the White Witch, and the reality of 4 children.  I would also like to say that I'm glad they picked the 4 children they did.  It's nice to see a big film company use kids who can lose themselves into what there doing to become their characters, instead of big name actors trying to make big bucks and earn their next major award.\n",
      "A wonderful movie that our whole family can enjoy.  My kids have watched it hundreds of times and never get tired of it.  And it's nice knowing they are watching a movie that teaches good lessons!\n",
      "I've never read the literary classics that comprise C.S. Lewis' epic \"Chronicles of Narnia\" series. Growing up, I know that some of the books were required reading in some of my friends' classes, but never in my own, and then once I began to develop my own taste in books, those novels never really seemed to pique my interest all that much. When the trailers began showing up advertising the release of the first film, in what Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media were hoping to be a hit franchise based on the novels, my initial reaction was that it looked interesting and appeared to have great special effects, but I wasn't sure if it was the kind of movie I would enjoy. I know that the novels had previously been adapted, with a very limited budget by the BBC into low-budget movies, so I figured this new film had to at least look better than those did, but aside from Peter Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" novels, I really hadn't enjoyed that many fantasy films. I personally didn't enjoy the `Neverending Story' franchise, or \"Legend\" starring a younger Tom Cruise, and generally speaking most movies with kids as the main characters tend to be a bit on the annoying side, so my expectations were coming in a tad on the low side. As low as my expectations were for this upcoming film, when the numerous positive reviews began pouring in, and more action and intriguing story elements were being shown in the TV spots appearing on almost every station known to man, my interest along with my expectations began increasing significantly until the movie finally arrived in theaters giving me the chance to see if all the hype was true or if I would be bored to tears, as I feared could be the case.\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" is the story of four siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, as they accidentally stumble across the wondrous land of Narnia, via a magical wardrobe hidden in their house. As they begin to explore this strange new world, and encounter several of its inhabitants, the children soon realize that this once-peaceful world has been plunged into what appears to be an eternal winter filled with despair courtesy of the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton) who has proclaimed herself Queen of Narnia. The longer the children spend in Narnia the more they begin to understand that their appearance in this world was not some random incident, but in fact had been foretold in a prophecy, and that these four children, along with a powerful lion named Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), would lead the good creatures of Narnia in a revolt against the evil White Witch and her minions to return Narnia to its rightful state of peace and happiness.So, after going from absolutely having no interest in seeing \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" to being pretty much excited to see it, I was very pleased that once I watched the film I could honestly say that I loved every minute of it. The movie avoided the pitfalls that I expected it to fall victim to, for instance; having the children be too cutesy and/or annoying brats or just being unbelievable as actual kids via their moods, actions, or whatever; having an extremely boring story with the occasional action sequence to excite the audience but not much else to fill the time (i.e. \"The Golden Compass\"); or knowing that it was a Christian themed story, having the basic story be so cheesy and over-the-top in the delivery of the Christian allegory that it would be laughable and yet another example of a horrible attempt to make a Christian movie. Thankfully `Narnia' maneuvered easily around each of these trouble spots emerging victorious as the first successful entry into what will hopefully become an entertaining franchise for audiences everywhere to enjoy.The story, as adapted by Ann Peacock, Andrew Adamson, Christopher Marks, and Stephen McFeely, and based upon the novel by C.S. Lewis, was incredibly fast-paced and entertaining, even though the beginning had me a little worried that it was going to drag out the pre-Narnia part of the children's lives, but even those scenes were surprisingly well-played and lively. Director Andrew Adamson (who also co-wrote the screenplay) deftly handled all of the fantasy elements and action sequences that the story required, while balancing them out with the much quieter moments as the children begin to understand their place in this new world, and the heavy burdens that accompany such an incredible destiny. I was surprised with how solid Adamson's direction was for this movie, since his previous efforts had been the hit animated films \"Shrek\" and \"Shrek 2\" which he was a co-director on for both, so as his first solo outing `Narnia' is an extremely impressive effort that he absolutely knocks out of the park from beginning to end.The primary cast for `Narnia', namely the four siblings, was comprised of relative newcomers to the world of acting, as this was the first movie for most of the kids. It's surprising that Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media would trust newcomers with the starring roles in a movie that could essentially launch a fantasy series that may rival New Line Cinema's epic `Lord of the Rings' trilogy, but the gamble paid off and I honestly don't think any other actors could have done any better. Academy Award winner Tilda Swinton (\"Michael Clayton\") was an ideal choice to play the evil White Witch, and she seemed to enjoy the chance to play such an evil, villainous character and made the most out of every scene she was given. Providing the voice of the majestic lion Aslan, actor Liam Neeson (\"Batman Begins\"), along with incredibly realistic CGI, gave the character a commanding presence with a calm soothing voice that was firm and authoritative, yet soft and caring.I honestly could continue complimenting the various elements of the movie for several more paragraphs, but you the reader would no doubt grow weary of me and lose interest. So, I only have one more item that I feel must be recognized when reviewing this film, and of course I am referring to the outstanding CGI work produced by the special effects wizards that worked so hard behind the scenes on `Narnia'. Without their expertise and considerable talents, this movie would not have been nearly as impressive, and the various creatures wouldn't have been brought to such vibrant life in a way that you almost believed that lions could speak, centaurs could walk amongst us, and that a magical world of wonder actually could exist on the other side of a wardrobe and all you have to do is be lucky enough to find it.\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" is an extremely entertaining thrill ride of a fantasy film comprised of brilliant special effects, excellent storytelling, and a talented cast that when mixed together delivers a movie experience that audiences can enjoy for years to come.\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" is rated PG for violence.\n",
      "It doesn't get much better than this save for of course Lord Of The Rings. I am pleased to see the fantasy genre of films being taken more seriously as of late and hope to see this continued. This adaptation of C.S.Lewis' The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe was very well executed. The music was amazing, the acting exceptional, the costumes were beautifully done, and the directing was superb. If you have not yet seen this film, do so immediately and invite a few children in your life to experience it with you and may their excitement and awe inspire you. I only hope that they put as much energy and detail into the continuing Chronicles of Narnia.\n",
      "Very good movie with wonderful characters and scenery. I read these books when younger- all of the creativity and imagination the author put into  the books transfers to the big screen. This whole series is very well done.\n",
      "This movie could teach the Harry Potter people a thing or three about how to do an adaptation correctly: how to keep scenes from the book, add scenes of your own and STILL maintain the book's spirit.The movie opens with an unexpected bang, as we see firsthand the damage caused by the air raids over London and quickly establish the contentious relationship between Peter and Edmund.  We're then taken to the train station where we see the full effect the war is having on families as they're separated in the name of safety.  It's impossible not to have boundless respect and admiration for the British for standing strong in the face of this instead of caving in to Hitler like so many other countries in Europe.But I digress -- and the film does not.  The addition of these scenes allows the film to truly delve into the price of war, and the conflict the idea of war causes for the children.  But the message by the end is clear, and echoes the reality: some things are worth fighting for.The movie has a great pace and some beautiful cinematography.  The WETA workshop people did a magnificent job (Harry Potter people take note!  THIS is what a centaur should look like, dammit!) and the acting is also wonderful -- particularly James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus, all the children and Tilda Swinton, who invoked some real fear in me as the dreaded White Witch.  In fact my ONLY complaint about this movie is that sometimes director Andrew Adamson (apparently eager to prove himself as capable of directing something other than Shrek movies) occasionally uses cheap directing tricks that distract from the story.  Examples include abruptly long silences at moments of high tension and one particularly pointless scene where everyone's in fast-motion except Peter, both of which are ultimately distracting.  But we can be forgiving, because he succeeds so grandly in so many other areas.One of the best parts of this movie is the score.  I loved it so much that I raced out to buy it right after seeing the movie on Dec. 10th -- only to find out (after driving the salespeople crazy as they looked for it) that it's not coming out until December 13th!  That's too bad, because it means I'll have to wait three more days to bring this music home.  It includes new songs from Alanis Morissette and Imogen Heap and will be well worth the sale price I get it for on Tuesday.  SEE THIS MOVIE!!  Fans of the book won't be disappointed and people who've never read them will be welcomed into a fabulous new world.And as others have said, don't leave the theater the minute the credits roll!  There's an epilogue!\n",
      "I pre-ordered this set, and I like the way the bookends look and the DVD's are great.  The only issue I have is that I did not recieve my 10-page booklet.  I believe (and I went through the ENTIRE package) that it was not put in my set.  I now have to go and buy the DVD's again in order to get the booklet and I am NOT happy.  Everything else about the set is great I'm just upset that I didn't get my booklet.\n",
      "This movie is brillant! Our family eagerly has anticipated this movie and we were not one bit disappointed. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the story of the four Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. The children are evacuated from London during the bombings of World War II into the countryside, where they arrive at the estate of the eccentric Professor Kirke. Upon playing hide and seek on a rainy day Lucy discovers an empty room which contains a wardrobe. Lucy climbs into the wardrobe to hide, however she finds herself in the snowy woods of Narnia. This particular scene is reminiscent of Judy Garland opening her front door and stepping into the land of Oz. Lucy meets Mr. Tumnus, a faun who invites her to tea. During tea Mr. Tumnus tells Lucy that Narnia has been under an evil spell cast by the White Witch for the past 100 years, which makes it always winter but never Christmas. Mr. Tumnums also reveals he is in the pay of the White Witch as a kidnapper, but decides to send Lucy back to the city of Spare Oom in the far land of Wardrobe instead of handing her over to the witch. Lucy arrives back in the empty room only to find that time has stood still with the game of hide and seek going on. Later in the night Lucy decides to sneak back to the room containing the wardrobe, Edmund follows her and finds himself in Narnia. Edmund meets the White Witch and reveals to her there are four Pevensie children after the Witch feeds him enchanted Turkish Delight. The Witch tells Edmund to bring his siblings to her and as a reward he will receive more Turkish Delight as well as sharing the throne of Narina. Lucy is delighted Edmund has discovered Narnia also but is humilated by him later in front of their siblings. The next day the four children find themselves bundling into the wardrobe to hide from Mrs. McCreedy and find their way into Narnia. Lucy takes them to Mr. Tumnus's cave only to find Mr. Tumnus has been arrested by the White Witch and his cave in shambles. A robin leads the children to Mr. and Mrs. Beaver. The Beavers inform the children of the prophecy of Cair Parivel when two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve sit on the four thrones of Cair Paravel and with Aslans return the White Witch will be defeated. Edmund leaves the Beavers to return to the White Witch, who throws him in prison when he arrives alone. Edmund informs the Witch where his siblings are, that they are to meet Aslan at the stone table, whereupon she instructs Margrim, her chief of police to take his army and destroy them all. There is an intense escape scene from the Beavers dam into the woods. In the woods the children meet Father Christmas who gives them weapons to use in the upcoming battle against the Witch. As the children and the Beavers travel through Narnia, spring has come since Aslan is on the move. The group arrives at Aslans camp where they prepare for battle. The White Witch takes Edmund and her army to arrive at the Stone Table before Aslan. However the Witches camp is discovered after Maurgrim attacks Lucy and Susan in the woods. Aslans army frees Edmund and he is reinstated into the Pevensie family. The White Witch arrives at Aslan's camp to proclaim Edmund a traitor and to claim his blood. Aslan and the White Witch meet and later in the evening Aslan goes to the stone table to offer himself as a sacrifice in Edmunds place. Lucy and Susan who accompained Aslan through the woods follow him to the stone table and watch as the Witch slays him. The girls mourn over their beloved Aslan but as the sunrises the stone table is split in two and Aslan is resurrected. The girls and Aslan fly through the woods to the battle field where Peter and Edmund are in the throws of war with the White Witch and her army. The battle scene is spectacular! It is on the same caliber of the \"Lord of the Rings\", but with less bloodshed/violence. Ultimately the White Witch is defeated by Aslan. Edmund is wounded as others are but Lucy uses the gift Father Christmas gave her the elixir of the fireflowers to revive the wounded. The four children sit in the thrones of Cair Paravel as kings and queens of Narnia. Aslan leaves Cair Paravel to venture to other lands. The children now as adults find themselves chasing the white stag through the woods when they discover the lamppost. Lucy leads them through the woods and back into the wardrobe. As they spill out of the wardrobe they are transformed back into children who are greeted by Professor Kirke. Later in the night Lucy attempts to go back to Narnia via the wardrobe but Professor Kirke tells her she can go back to Narnia but not via the wardrobe again.This movie is a faithful adaptation of the C.S. Lewis classic. There are a few added special effects from Hollywood which were not in the book but they serve as a tie in the story. The directing,casting,screenplay, musical score are brilliant! I am sure C.S. Lewis himself would have been pleased with this movie.Our family is eagerly planning on attending another showing of this movie during the Christmas/New Year season. This is destined to become a classic as the book itself is.\n",
      "great\n",
      "Follows the book fairly well. Sometimes books are difficult to translate to cinema but this movie captured the book's essence in a thoughtful, respectful way.\n",
      "I have been reading these books since I was in college, and I think I've seen every attempt at dramatizing \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" that's ever been created.  This one left them all in the dust.It had a similar effect on me as the first installment of \"Lord of the Rings,\" and the first shot of Lantern Waste has me in tears much as the first shot of Rivendell did.  Both had kind of a \"Yes!  That's it!\" quality, as if everything I'd ever envisioned was being brought to life.  However, where Peter Jackson eventually went completely nuts with the plot, in effect writing his own story and saying Tolkien did it WRONG, this film has interpolations I did not find particularly intrusive.  The basic plot remained intact, and the whole film conveyed a sense of bringing to life what CS Lewis actually wrote.  I was a little worried when I saw that Disney was producing this that they'd dumb it down, but the story remains essentially, beautifully intact.I have to add that CS Lewis is my all-time favorite Christian theologian.  I feel that the reviews that have said this is anti-Bible or pro-witchcraft or whatever really need to be taking issue with CS Lewis' writings rather than the movie because the movie is presenting them very faithfully.  The good lion Aslan, son of the Great Emperor Over the Sea, gives his own innocent life for the life of a traitor and is subsequently reborn.  \"The rules\" for this sort of thing antedate the beginning of recorded history.  If you're a Christian, what is there to take issue with here?  If you're a fantasy enthusiast, could you find a better parable or allegory for sin and redemption?  Despite its few dramatic departures, this was a wonderful realization of CS Lewis' book, and I hope and pray that they continue with the rest of the series!\n",
      "Well done representation of the book. Not perfect, but overall done well. Our family likes it, and I have shown it in my 2nd grade class.\n",
      "And I was not disappointed.  Disney got it right.  They actually made the movie I have been waiting for most of my life.I have read the classic book, The Lion, the Witch, and The Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis, literally dozens and dozens of times, and I believe that this film is destined to become a classic in its own right. It is a family oriented movie that stays quite true to the original story. A warning to the purists, the are a few minor name changes, for some reason.This movie is excellent, entertaining, and enjoyable on all levels: phenomenal special effects and make-up; breathtaking cinematography; and, of course, top-notch performances.  Performances in this film are across the board superior, extremely expressive, and display a wide range of emotions.The plot is complete, and, as stated earlier, it matches book almost perfectly. It is fast-paced and action-packed; a thrilling ride from beginning to end.  It was truly worth the wait.\n",
      "A worried mother puts her four children on a train and sends them to the English countryside in order to protect them from the war.  They arrive on the doorstep of a professor whom the stern housekeeper says they are not to bother.  One day they relieve their boredom by playing a game of Hide and Seek.  The youngest child, Lucy, discovers an old wardrobe in a deserted room and decides to hide there.  As she steps back in the wardrobe, she enters another world, Narnia, where the White Witch has declared that there will be perpetual winter.  So begins the adventure of \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\", written by C.S. Lewis who was during the first part of his life, an avowed atheist but who eventually became a strong believing Christian whose literary works influenced many believers and non-believers alike.  The symbolism of the lion Aslin will be clear to Christians and will hopefully introduce unbelievers to the Christian message.  The four children are wonderfully natural in their portrayals and the movie is produced with stunning visual effects.  This is not for small children, but older ones will undoubtedly enjoy the wonderful retelling of Lewis's book.\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia was brought to life on screen better than I have ever seen it! The visual effects were astonding! A great family adventure! If you liked the book, then you will like this! If you have not read the book, you should still enjoy the movie!\n",
      "A great family movie!  No, Azlan is NOT mohammed, buddha or anyone other than Jesus!  This introduces children to Christ in ways they can understand and help to develop their own personal relationship with HIm!  I love this movie!!\n",
      "Peter, Susan, Edmond, and Lucy are four siblings that go to their unfamiliar uncle's house to to escape the bombs going off in London. While there they play cricket and accidentally break one of the windows in the house. So they hide from the housekeeper in a wardrobe but the go to far inside and end up in a magical land called Narnia.In Narnia they make friends with talking animals and learn that there is a spell put on the land by the White Witch who claims that she is queen of Narnia. But really there's another ruler who's name is Aslan, a talking lion.Edmond becomes ensnared by the White Witch's promises to make him king and betrays his siblings so they have to try with the help of their animal friends to defeat the White Witch and get Edmond back on their side.I really like this story because it's adventurous and I like the characters. I've probably read this three or four times. It's one of my favorite books. The book cover is really cool and shows some of the scenes that are in the book.I've read the whole serious and I like the movies.3 Book BeesOriginally posted at [...].\n",
      "I finally managed to go out and see this magnificent work of art.I have been a fan of Narnia world since I was a little kid growing up in Poland. I remember reading the books and watching any TV movies made about this magical world.Seeing this on the big screen in the dark theater was so powerful, so loud, alive and colorful that I almost forgot I was watching a movie, I felt like I was there in person.The four kids, Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy Pevensie were totally new faces to me but I trusted them to tell the story well and they sure did. I found little Lucy to be the most adorable little girl ever, she was delightful and heartwarming and a real pleasure to watch.I loved the scenery, from the land to never ending winter to the thawing spring breaking through, to the evil and cold witch, who appeared somewhat nice only to be rigid and heartless, to the animals, the fawns, centaurs, wolves, cheetahs, rhinos, flying gryphon's, beavers, polar bears, buffalos and ghouls and goblins down to the magnificent Aslan.I was a wimp, I shed a few tears along with few other people in the audience at the tender and sad scenes, but overall I felt like I've spent 2 magical hours of land of sorcery and shining armor.This is a wonderful movie, and not to be missed whether you read the books or not, do yourself a favor and enjoy it.\n",
      "Got this for my daughters schooling and we also have the books and they are both great items to have.\n",
      "I really enjoyed showing this to my class after we read the book. Using the digital copy was so easy to use\n",

      "For all you fantasy fans who thought that the conclusion of The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars was the end of the world, think again.  The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe should satisfy the needs of fantasy fans of all ages.The new movie is based on a series of seven books by author C.S. Lewis.  However, this isn't the first time Narnia has been adapted for the screen.  An animated movie of 'Lion' premiered in 1979, and the BBC series in the late 1980s gave viewers a taste of almost the whole series, in which 'Lion' is the second book chronologically, but the first in the series published.'Lion' focuses on the four Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy.  The story takes place in the midst of World War II England, and the kids are whisked away from home to get escape the air raids.  They go to stay with a professor who, if you've read The Magician's Nephew, is a very significant character.While the bored children play a game of hide-and-seek in the professor's mansion, the youngest, Lucy, stumbles into an old and beautiful wardrobe, and walks into another world: Narnia.  It is here that her, and her siblings', adventure begins.It has been winter in Narnia for 100 years, and is ruled over by the White Witch.  The Pevensie children turn out to be part of a prophecy saying that four children would save the (talking) animals and mystical creatures of Narnia.  They must find a way to defeat the White Witch and restore power in Narnia.  However, Edmund might not be on his siblings' side, as the White Witch tries to seduce Edmund with thoughts of power and an endless supply of Turkish delight (think: Revenge of the Sith?).This movie stayed very close to the book; barely anything was out of place at all.  The cast was excellent, especially Georgie Henley as Lucy, who did a stunning job.  Liam Neeson was also great as the voice of the lion king, Aslan.  However, I can't keep thinking that maybe James Earl Jones would have been better.And the White Witch couldn't have been more perfect.Several scenes in the movie were perfect as well, such as the meeting between Lucy and the fawn Tumnus.  Another great, though sad scene was Aslan's sacrifice on the Stone Table.  That scene followed close to the book as well, and was so touching I swear I was close to tears, even though I knew what would happen next.  However. for people who haven't read the book, small children in particular, it could be quite distressing to watch.The battle scene at the end of the movie was incredibly fun to watch, though some parts dealing with the special effects and the scene in general were slightly awkward.  Speaking of the special effects, those were very good as well, especially in the form of the talking animals of Narnia.All in all, this was, and is, a great, and certainly unique, fantasy story.  The fact that Disney is only making two sequels is a little disappointing to me, but maybe, just maybe, they'll make all seven.That would be great.\n",
      "i  always  love  to  watch  on  my  blu ray  playermy  girl friend  got  it  for  memy  family  and  friends\n",
      "this movie is simply wonderful.  i have read all of the narnia books and i hope that any movies following will be just as good as this one.  the film was even better than the book and brought the characters to life beautifully!!  the special effects and cinematography in this film also deserve recognition.  everything about this movie is excellent.  i highly recommend going to see it even even if you have not read the stories.  it's wonderful!\n",
      "I like the whole way the movie goes it's just so amazing.I like how it starts with a scene in a war.Then the kids get sent away it's kinda sad,but then they go to one of there relatives who owns this wardrobe which can transport certain people to this awsome world called Narnia.I for one think the way they thought of using myhtological creatures was interesting my favorite ones were a griffin,a fawn,and a centurean.The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\n",
      "MOVIE: Like the \"skirts and sandals\" phase of movies that hollywood went throught, we now have the fantasy epic phase. I'm not complaining though, I think fantasy is a great genre, and those kind of films are hard to come by. A great fantasy film I recall seeing as a child was The Neverending Story. With HUGE success for The Lord Of The Rings films and HUGE success for Potter and the gang, we now see another work of great literature finding its way to the silver screen. Narnia tells the tale of four siblings finding a porthole into a new world through the wardrobe in their temporary foster home. We learn that the winter in Narnia has been lasting for 100 years now, and that the evil white witch has ruled over the land with an iron fist. We have to remember that this is a film aimed at the younger crowd, but there is plenty to enjoy for the older audience. The film boasts absolutely amazing special effect, as it should. Special effects were done at the WETA workshop in New Zealand, which is where the magic happened for Lord of The Rings and King Kong.  Disney and Walden Media suppossedly spent a whopping $150 million on this production, and if you look at the adverising push they did then that budget may have risen as far as $200 million. The sets are magnificent, and you actually are thrown into this wintry land of fantasy. The score by Harry Gregson-Williams is also absolutly stunning. He forays into a very beautiful orchestral score with some great vocals. It feels like a lighter toned version of his score to Kingdom Of Heaven. Harry Gregson-Williams is my favorite composer that has left the guidance of Hans Zimmer. He developed his own style, and even though the influence of Zimmer is heard in his music it's not overpowering. Other composers from the Media Ventures camp like Klaus Badelt feel like Hans Zimmer clones when they compose.  Look for the score come Oscar time, it should be nominated. Adrew Adamson takes on his first live action film as a director and does a fantastic job with it. Adamson started his directing with Shrek and followed it with the incredibly successful Shrek 2, so I don't think Disney had a problem giving him the job for this expensive film seeing the profit he turned in for Dreamworks with the Shrek films. Costume design and make-up were more lavish than I expected. I expected the costumes to look as if they were from a play, but they were amazing. During the rare occasion that there is a non CGI creature, the make-up on the actor is amazing. Mr. Tumnus is an excellent example of amazing make-up. His small home in the woods is also a great example of the amazing set design. Narnia truly comes to life in this film, and it should see some nominations in the techinical categories. Now, while the film is pretty to look at, it does have its flaws as some of the dialogue is pretty cheesy and some points in the film are very saccharine. Every now and then you get the lame hand on the shoulder and the intent gaze of approval, and then we have the religous undertone. I am not religious at all, and found that the film focused too much on making Aslan a Jesus figure and paid too much time to the theme of having to sacrifice some things for the benefit of others. Overall, I enjoyed this film more than Harry Potter, and I think that this could be a great franchise.ACTING: Having an all children cast is always risky, mainly because of inexperience with actually portraying emotion through acting. However, the kids do an amazing job. I never really liked the children from Harry Potter. Georgie Henley, who plays the youngest daughter, does a fantastic job. You could call her the British Dakota Fanning. As for the rest of the cast, it's mostly CGI. Tilda Swinton does a great job as the white witch, and she does a great job with being evil. The voice acting for the CGI is fantastic. Liam Neeson is probably the most well known actor doing voice work. He gives Aslan the lion a sense of wisdom. My favorite animals would have to be the two married beavers who just bicker as typical husband and wife. The film has everything from cheetahs to polar bears.BOTTOM LINE: A visual feast for the eyes from director Andrew Adamson, and a strong and emotional score from Harry Gregson-Williams. The CGI is astounding, and the sets are amazing. The film is very entertaining even if it get's saccharine at times, but then you have set youself in a child's mindset. A new fanstasy franchise is born.\n",
      "I love this movie, I thought it would be good for my 4 year old but it was too scary for her. Maybe better for a 7 year old or older. Otherwise this is an awesome movie!\n",
      "Really like how redemption happens!  Kids really enjoyed seeing the battle scenes.  Also able to make it clear to kids how deceptive evil can be and how it looks enticing.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite movies of all times.  My three year old granddaughter and I watch it together all the time.  Special effects are fantastic.  Great story, great movie!!\n",
      "Along with Walter Farley's Black Stallion series (well most of it anyway...), CS Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia were amongst my favorite books growing up - even today (at age 43), I have the books memorized virtually word-for-word, and my junior-year thesis in high school was about CS Lewis and the Narnia series.(I mention \"The Black Stallion\" because I was (and still am) so utterly disappointed with the 1978 Coppola film due to the major changes made to the classic story.)  However, these days (I believe largely due to the Harry Potter series) filmmakers seem to be making a greater effort to 'stick to' classic books as they were written, and thank GOODNESS that was the case here!The film starts rather differently from the book with the London Blitzkrieg and British children being sent to the country for safekeeping - keep in mind that when the book was first published in 1950, WWII was still very fresh in the minds of everyone and there was no need to explain in detail what the air-raids were about.  I thought the children, particularly Peter and Lucy, were spot on; I didn't care much for Susan, but then again, she wasn't my favorite Pevensie in the books either (knowing what happens to Susan in \"The Last Battle\" is probably coloring my viewpoint a bit, however!).  Since the film was made also to appeal to 2005 audiences (who expect a lot of action and adventure) I wasn't surprised to see that certain bits and details, such as Father Christmas taking a high tea out of his sack for the children and the Beavers, were omitted, and other scenes not in the book (such as the three Pevensies and Beavers following Edmund to Jadis' castle) were included.  (BTW I had to chuckle at the bit where Peter and Edmund are practicing their horsemanship and swordplay prior to the battle and Edmund says \"get up horsie\" and the horse responds with \"My name is Philip\").  Speaking of the rest of the cast...I thought Mr. Tumnus was WONDERFUL, better than I had ever envisioned in my mind, he was PERFECT.  As were the Beavers - Mrs. Beaver chiding Mr. Beaver for spending too much time with Badger, giving them both Cockney accents.  Jadis was incredible - again a perfect rendition.  The battle scene was awesome, as was the pivotal scene at the Stone Table.  And Aslan...it was CLEARLY obvious that the producers and directors made every effort to ensure that Aslan would have the impact and regalness that was DEMANDED.  WONDERFUL.I LOVED this film and look forward to seeing \"Prince Caspian\" (Okay...I'm a traditionalist and believe the books must be read in the order they were released...obviously the filmmakers agreed with me, since they didn't start with \"The Magician's Nephew\" which is actually, IMO, the weakest of the seven books along with \"The Silver Chair\").\n",
      "Awesome movie to watch after reading the story. The novel was on my childs reading list makes for a good treat after finishing the book.\n",
      "Great movie - children are captivated by the entrance into a far-away land, and they will learn the importance of truth and obedience.  Buy it!\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE this DVD! I'm not a huge fan of the book itself (it's satisfactory), but the movie itself is AWESOME!I just love Aslan and Tumnus (he's my all-time favorite character) and the Pevensie children (especially Lucy, I think I can relate to her the most). This movie is heartwarming, thrilling, chilling (no White Witch pun intended!), and, if you're sentimental, tear-jerking.If you haven't seen this movie yet, then you don't know what you're missing! Go out and buy it!Oh yeah, and just a suggestion: you might want to get the 2-disc edition, because that provides more extras than the original 1-disc edition.\n",
      "I love the characters of this movie and it was so well done. The cinematography is breath taking. And of course C.S. Lewis parallel of the story of Christ's crucifiction is incredibly moving and brilliant. This will always be one of my favorite movies and a true classic!\n",
      "When I was a child I read this book and in turn have read it to my children.  The movie did well and exceeded my own imagination!\n",
      "I was very interested in seeing this movie, although a little wary because Disney was making it.  It is a Christian allegory, but Disney isn't known for making good Christian stories.  My fears were put to rest, though.  The movie was fantastic!  They stayed very close to the books.  It had a lot of depth and the people they chose to play the characters were superb.  Tilda Swinson made a great white witch.  She was cold (in more ways than one) and heartless.  She had a great subtlety to her performance.  The kids were great.  Skandar Keynes was great as Edmund.  You could see his struggles and why he was doing what he was doing.  A must see movie!\n",
      "Awesome movie that's great for all ages. 4 disc collection is packed with a lot of goodies :)  intense action scenes.\n",
      "Absolutely love the movie! My daughter read all the books and she also loves the movies. The way C.S. Lewis put together such a an amazing set of stories to depict our life here with CHRIST has always kept my attention. I think this is a great way to share a classic with a non-reader (as I was) and even spark their interest in reading.\n",
      "I thought The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe was as good as the short story it's based on. If you like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, you will like this too.\n",
      "it was what it said it was got here when it said it would no problems at all thank a lot\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia is an interesting \"animal\" in it's marketability. C.S. Lewis' allegory-laden works are more accessible, on many levels for children and church-folk. So, thus the Narnia audience is broader due to its mix of borrowed mythology and Christian imagery. This release is well timed, following the success of both the Harry Potter franchise and the Lord of the Rings \"trilogy.\" Well-timed also because the limits of computer animation has been pushed far enough to reverently envision the world of NARNIA. But you still have to work with those darn child actors, or do you...hmm.Narnia, unlike the Lord of the Rings' Middle-Earth, this fantasy-land never quite comes across as consistently real. The Special Effects are very mixed: the wolves are impressive and Aslan, voiced perfectly by Liam Neilson, seems infinitely more realistic than his BBC counterpart (which, many of the other creatures are rather, soulless. Some landscapes recreated on sound-stages and matte paintings are plainly artificial. While, some meshing of real and digital works. Some of these moments with the actors do not. New Zealand director Andrew Adamson, of Shrek 1 & 2, doesn't have much experience with live action movies, coming from a Special Effects background, and maybe the child actors are out of their depth when it comes to acting in front of a green-screen. A lot of \"The Lord of the Rings\" works because the actors convincingly interact with each other as well as with the real or illusion environment. In this film, that doesn't happen. The children are also awkward and foundering when asked to portray some of the more complicated scenes. But I am profoundly pleased that children were cast who look like real WWII evacs and not Sears models.  As for the adult talent, the Evil White Witch, as played by Tilda Swanson was perfect performance for the genre.The film's opening shares more character insights and background than Lewis himself does, foreshadowing Edmund's selfish nature. With a brief but intense air raid on London, leading to the emotional juxtaposition of the evacuation of children to the country. Both beautiful cinematic moments not in the original text. Other classic moments that were from the text, like Lucy finding the wardrobe, were a pleasure to watch.Then of course some of the problems lie with the original material, Lewis' book. The Narnia series is heavy on allegory and a mix of global myths in the fantasy world without any important dramatic justification unlike Tolkien's work. While such a miscellaneous fairy-world work in print or in children's minds, it certainly is difficult to portray on screen without appearing hackneyed to today's audiences. \"Chronicles\" had been promoted as \"a Lord of the Rings for kids\" this is misleading. It may have been the intention of its makers, but not the end product.But in the end it is a FINE big screen version of a fine book series with many magical moments and I hope it does well enough in theaters and on DVD to warrant more films.\n",
      "We saw this last night in a crowded theater and I was fairly underwhelmed, but maybe if I hadn't read the book I would like it more?Perhaps an extended version would have played better, because the nagging feeling never left me that something was missing.  I could have used some more establishing scenes that showed the Pevensie children having some camaraderie with the creatures of Aslan's army, in the days before the big battle.  As it is, they just sort of swan in and everyone bows--why?  Just because they're human?  Why would all these beasts and centaurs and fauns etc fight for four little humans to conquer them all?  In the book it was sort of explained, and part of that was a certain amount of interchange among all the species, not just the girls playing and the boys riding talking horses.Compare that to the slow-paced, but ultimately worth it bonding scenes in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and you have an idea of what the emotional payoff might have been for NARNIA.However that said it was a spectacular film with some great action sequences, especially trying to cross the river before it melted, a scene which brought back ancestral memories from the very first days of cinema, when Lillian Gish floated on the ice in D W Griffith's WAY DOWN EAST, which this film seemed to be quoting.I didn't like any of the children very much.  Can't wait till that little girl grows up and the gap shrinks between her three front teeth.  I couldn't bear to look at her except when she was crying and that made me feel like a perv.Tilda Swinton put a lot into the part!  Probably more than was in the script.  When she made her triumphant speech on the stone table about the return of \"deep magic,\" she might have been louder, like take some voice lessons or something, she just didn't have the vocal power to shriek it out at the end; but in every other scene she excelled my highest expectations.  At the end of the movie we voted to award her the Oscar for best actress and to give a special award to the NUT who designed her winter and summer wardrobes.  They were eye popping, Leigh Bowery would have been proud.\n",
      "I recently saw this film again after five years, and I stand amazed: it appears, if anything, even more elegant, well designed, and timely than it did in 2005.  With its gorgeously photographed locations, seamless effects, simple yet ambitious physical design, and engaging performances, this movie has withstood several years much better than most can, or ever will.  And its allegory has the potential to instruct children without lecturing them.Director Andrew Adamson creates both the British Blitz and his beleaguered fantasy world with such unassuming grace that it can take effort to recall that these places don't exist in our modern age.  His young actors inhabit both locales with a simple grace, as though they don't realize they are doing anything exceptional.  I never got the feeling of watching a historical pageant or school play, as with prior productions.Beside Peter Jackson's LOTR movies and the Harry Potter films, Narnia marks a reassuring trend in cinematic fantasy: directors depict wonder without childish naiveté, and they capture the grim underpinnings of magic without maudlin dystopia.  These changes in how films depict fantasy reflect, I think, a more balanced view of reality.  And since Lewis intended viewers to learn something about real life, I think he would approve of this development.\n",
      "I had never read anything about this series of Narnia, so at age 57 yrs, I found it very interesting, and appreciated that all the bloody gore was left out.  Seems on TV there is too much of it, and with the Iraq war, I have had enough.  This had plenty of excitement for kids, which Disney is famous for.  I recently went to the theater to see Narnia(King Caspian) which I was somewhat disappointed how it started out, where the kids just suddenly found themselves in Narnia, but the remaining movie was very comparable.  I have no regrets purchasing this DVD, for I enjoyed the course I took of Greek Mythology and Legend in college, so am sold on this movie.\n",
      "\"The Chronicles of Narnia:  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" is a wonderful film that the entire family will enjoy.  Since I have not read the books, I am basing my review only on the film.  In this tale, the four Pevensie children are cast into the magical world of Narnia via the Professor's wardrobe.  Once inside, the children learn that they are part of a prophecy that will lift the dark curse of the White Witch and save Narnia's magnificent inhabitants.As another reviewer stated, one of the first things that I noticed about this film was how the entire young audience remained quiet throughout the entire film.  In fact, the only real noise in the theater was the whimpers of younger children afraid of what happens to Aslan the lion in the film.  That's a difficult thing to do these days, especially since most kids are either easily distracted or their parents ignore them or don't even take them to the movies, preferring to drop them off at the kiddie show whilst they take in other fare.The story is wonderful.  I've read and watched interviews with the producers, directors, actors, etc. in this film and all of them were posed the obvious \"Christian\" questions about the film.  It's apparent that Disney wanted to tone down the \"Christian\" quotient in the film since most of the answers to the Christianity questions were downplayed.  However, C.S. Lewis' Christian aspects in this film are very evident, and I have nothing but praise for Disney for taking a chance and allowing the Christian themes to flow freely throughout the film.  Okay, so a few athiests and non-Christians will miss out on a wonderful adventure due to their prejudices.  As far as I'm concerned, it's their loss.  The Christian aspects of this story are key to its development and if you are only remotely familiar with the Gospels, you will quickly pick up on the symbolism of the four children, the White Witch, and, the most obvious of all, Aslan.There are moments of humor in this film that give youngsters a break in the rather high drama of this tale.  Most of that humor is provided by Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, although young Lucy Pevensie almost steals the show with her cheery mood and big, innocent eyes.  The love between the children in this film is almost non-existent in movies these days, and it is refreshing to see a family that actually loves one another.There is also a rather violent aspect to this film.  This violence is doled out by the White Witch and her minions.  There are a number of creatures in this film that will likely frighten younger children, though the outcome of the battle between good and evil should settle most of their fears.  In fact, the only truly scary moment in this film occurs during the sacrificial sequence of a particular character.  In all honesty, this twenty-nine-year old almost broke down and cried at this pivotal moment in the film.  Of course, as a Catholic, this particular part of the film means a little bit more to myself than it may to others.  Also, the action and violence is primarily shot in close-ups, with a few exceptions.  One character does die a rather swift death that is visible to everyone, but most of the other deaths are dealt with tastefully and on a level that most kids can handle.The special effects are very, very exceptional.  Though not quite up to par with \"Lord of the Rings\" in the effects department, I have to admit that the effects are rather brilliant since there are many more talking animated creatures in this film than in \"Rings.\"The actors and actresses in this film, especially the youngsters, are wonderful.  The two oldest Pevensie children, Peter and Susan, are played by William Moseley and Anna Popplewell.  Moseley's character takes on a father-figure role and while he often hesitates when making decisions, he always does what he feels is right for his siblings.  Popplewell, though sometimes motherly, is best seen as the protective older sister.  She has a deep connection to her little brother and sister and accepts them wholly, good and bad aspects combined.  Skandar Keynes plays Edmund, the \"prodigal son\" of the four children.  His character probably develops more than any other in the film.  Young Georgie Henley nearly steals this entire film as little Lucy Pevensie.  Her innocent curiousity gets the ball rolling in the adventure, and her face lights up the screen time and time again.  Aslan is voiced by Liam Neeson.  There should be no other choice in my opinion.  His voice gave Aslan a regal quality, yet you could feel the fear within him when he makes a key decision in the film.  Tilda Swinton rounds out the cast of key characters as the sinister White Witch.  She lures young Edmund into her trap with \"sweeties\" in an attempt to prevent the prophecy from coming true.  She is cold and calculating, and her battle with Peter is one of the most exciting bits of this picture.This film will keep everyone's eyes glued to the screen.  For those who consider this film boring or childish, I'm betting that those particular people are, for the most part, non-Christians.  I'm not attacking anyone in particular, but if you don't have the \"tolerance\" to look past something that might be offensive to you, then you aren't as tolerant as you demand others to be.If you are a Christian, I suggest you let your children watch this film, no matter what their age.  Trust me, it's a lot easier on the eyes and the heart than \"The Passion of the Christ.\"  If you simply enjoy wonderful fantasy tales like \"Lord of the Rings,\" then this movie is right up your alley.  Highly recommended and I will definitely purchase this film when it comes out on DVD.\n",
      "My six year old daughter loved this film in the theater. She asked for the DVD forever. We watched it as a family, and enjoyed it throughly. I do caution, it does have a few scenes that may scare smaller children. My four year old didn't like the wolf scene or the stone table scene, but other than that, she really enjoyed the film. Hope you do as well.\n",
      "It's a shame that Disney doesn't feel like trying harder, because Book-Narnia is an incredible place, and could have kicked Movie-Middle Earth's butt.  Instead, they give us Tolkien-lite.  The CGI is rather heavy-handed at times, lacking the exquisite touches that have been used in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and in the two more recent Harry Potter movies.  There are also a few sloppy directorial decisions: no blood on anyone's weapons, all the centaurs look alike (not surprising as they are all played by the same four or five actors), and the one that annoyed me the most--Lucy's potion can cure a gut-wound, but not a split lip and a bruise.  Please.On the other hand, this was a beautiful illustration of a much-beloved series, even if Disney didn't give it all the attention it deserves.  Kudos to the casting-folks for picking four children who look like they could be siblings, and for finding four older actors who look astonishingly like their \"younger selves.\"  Also, thanks for SHOWING the battle.  C.S. Lewis seems to have shared his buddy Tolkien's squeamishness about action scenes, particularly violent ones; in the book, the battle lasts two and a half paragraphs, while the passage with the friggin' beavers drags on for about two chapters.  It was interesting to see the scale of the battle.  It illustrated the seeming hopelessness of Our Heroes plight, just as Peter Jackson brought the book-lackluster Helm's Deep darkly to life.  (An aside: I was glad to see quite a few lady-centaurs there on the front lines.  Also, the arrow-phoenix was much, much cooler than Fawkes.  Nice work, there.)Tilda Swanson was \"beautiful and terrible\" as the White Witch.  While I'm sure it would have been tempting to show the character as lovely and sharp as an icicle, the director presents us with a woman who looks less ethereal and more like an ancient Celtic Warrior-queen, complete with dreadlocks and a chainmail-and-fur gown.  She IS a warrior queen, who fights with sword and magic both in the battle, and a demented part of me couldn't help admiring her, even while I shuddered at the horror of her.Liam Neeson did a decent job as Aslan.  Not a lot to do with that character: he appears, he dies, he comes back, and he leaves.  I DID love the last little moment of the battle, when he and the witch look into each other's eyes.  Facinating.All in all, a B+ effort.  I hope that Disney will devote a little more energy to the next one than they do these stupid \"Cars\" movies.\n",
      "Imagination is a powerful word with a direct connotation to creative ability, an ability that often has provided mankind with numerous wondrous achievements from literary works to straight technical inventions.  C.S. Lewis, the creator of the fantasyland Narnia, displayed a vast imagination while also borrowing from his life experiences in Roman and Greek mythology, Christian beliefs, and his adoration for Beatrix Potter's fables.  The Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe presents C.S. Lewis' first book in a sequence of seven books portraying the life and struggle in Narnia that thoroughly displays his use of imagination, as it now offers the world a terrific cinematic experience about the continuous struggle between good and evil.The adaptation from the book, as mentioned, presents a faithful illustration of C.S. Lewis' world of Narnia.  It also puts forth a genuine touch from the real world from which Pevensie's come from, as the Luftwaffe terror bombs London in the opening.  These bombings force the mother to send her four children, Lucy (Georgie Henley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Peter (William Moseley), as so many others did during the World War II to the safety of the British countryside.  Nevertheless, to their dismay, the Pevensie children end up with a reclusive professor and his authoritarian housekeeper that demands utter silence and complete calmness.  To expect constant silence and calmness from children is suffocate children from experiencing childhood and the fabulous time of constant imagination - a time when C.S. Lewis familiarized himself with Beatrix Potter.In boredom, the four children find different things to preoccupy their repressed presence in the Victorian home of Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent).  One of the things is hide-and-seek, which leads the youngest of the four, Lucy, to hide in a wardrobe with fur coats.  However, the children's game of hide-and-seek turns into an extraordinary adventure for Lucy who uncovers that the wardrobe is a portal to a fantasyland called Narnia.  She befriends a faun, also known as a satyr in Greek mythology, whose name is Mr.Tumnus (James McAvoy).  The notion of beware of strangers emits strong warnings in Lucy's encounter with Mr.Tumnus, but it also teaches a lesson of friendship and trust.Eventually, when Lucy returns she has been gone for several hours, but only a brief second has past in the real world.  A happily excited Lucy wants to share her discovery, but they find that the wardrobe is only a wardrobe and not a portal, which leads the other siblings to think that her imagination is working overtime in the boring house.  Nonetheless, the four siblings will eventually find a way into Narnia that will bring them on a suspenseful adventure of treachery, love, friendship, and many other righteous qualities.  Somehow, the lives of the four siblings are connected with the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), who has deceived the nave Edmund, the younger brother, to bring his sisters and brother to her castle in false promises of Turkish Delight (sweets) and a throne.  The White Witch's true intentions are to kill the siblings, as they pose a threat to her. Meanwhile, in the south, Aslan is returning with an army with which he will try to destroy the White Witch icy grip of Narnia, as she also hunts the siblings on their escape south.Having read these books and in the light of recent year's releases of the Lord of the Rings, the expectations for this film mounted.  It got to a point where slight apprehension and uneasiness emerged, as C.S. Lewis has provided some of the fondest memories from my childhood when reading these books late at night anticipating the next turn of events within the next page.  It is with joyfulness and excitement that I must say that Andrew Adamson captured the feeling of C.S. Lewis' fantastic Narnia adventure.The two dear friends J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis lived and worked in the same town where they share many conversations, as members of the Inklings, a University of Oxford discussion group.  They probably shared their thoughts about right and wrong, mythology, and society among many other topics.  They both were Christians, professors, writers, and creators of imaginary distant lands.  However, one of them was to become the greater while the other would live in the shadow of his friend.  This was the case with C.S. Lewis, as he never accomplished the equal greatness of J.R.R. Tolkien.  The stories of Tolkien are more fluent, detailed, and unique while Lewis' stories emit a sense of familiarity, as they openly borrow elements from other cultures' mythology.  It is the commonness of Lewis that ushers him into the shadow of Tolkien.There is also, unfortunately, some slight awkwardness in how the four siblings behave in situations of high stress, as the psycho-emotional aspect of the film seems to suffer slightly.  However, C.S. Lewis' book and the film present the children in the way he wished children to be, as quiet, obedient, and well-mannered miniature adults with a high level of curiosity and imagination.  On the other hand, Tilda Swinton performs, as the White Witch, with energetic charisma and radiating darkness and evil that completely contrasts the innocence of the four children.  The performances between the children and Tilda Swinton balance extraordinarily well and in the end, remove any of the possible cinematic discomfort between the characters.Read in a Reuter article released by CNN, C.S. Lewis opposed his books shot in live-action while only allowing a reenactment in animated form.  However, ironically, I have a belief that he could not imagine the progress of cinematic technical achievement, which now can bring to life the creatures he visually generated in his mind.  The New Zeeland director Adamson takes on C.S. Lewis' brain-baby with delicate care, as he shot the film in live-action while incorporating computer-generated imagery that erases the memories of the cartoon The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1979).  In the end, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe presents a wonderful cinematic experience, but it lacks authentic imagination that creates uniqueness and originality to elevate it to brilliant piece of cinema.\n",
      "Movie itself was wonderful - quality of picture was not very clear.  And at times, especially towards the end of the movie, it kept stopping to load.\n",
      "I think it is a good family movie for any age to see. I loved what it represented. I give this two thumbs up!!!!\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a stunning movie, filled with magic, spectacle, terrific acting, excellent story telling and above all it remains true to the source.  Beginning with the Battle of Britain, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, is the story of 4 children who find themselves in the magical land of Narnia, where they are the hope talking animals and other fantastic creatures.  Narnia has been under the spell of the evil white witch, who blanketed the land in perpetual winter. Of course, the children with the help of Aslan, the king of the beasts, defeat the White Witch and become kings and queens of Narnia.  THe plotline may seem simple, but overall this movie is just fantastic.  The children , particularly Georgie Henley, who plays the pivotal character Lucy, are excellent in their roles.  There are moments of pure magic, like when Father Christmas arrives or when Lucy first stumbles into Narnia.  While some liberties have been taken with specifics of the story, even the most dedicated of Lewis fans should be happy with this movie.  Like Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe stays true to the vision of CS Lewis, creating a magical tale that is the best movie of 2005.\n",
      "This is a great movie. I really enjoyed it. Every thing from begining to end was good. The little girl and the lion were my favorite characters. Who ever came up with this story has a good imagination.\n",
      "At a time in which Hollywood considers it \"progressive\" to applaud and reward raunchier and raunchier movies, what a WONDERFUL treat it was to see a movie full of good values, good morals, good language...all in all, a movie for the entire family to enjoy!  The story is superb, the graphics are superb, the acting is superb...and I can't wait for the next installment.You do not have to be a Christian to enjoy this movie.  If you are a Christian, you will see parallels to stories from the Bible.  If you are not a Christian, or cannot find the parallels, this takes nothing away from the movie itself.An all-around GREAT family movie!!\n",
      "I just went to see this movie last night and WOW, it is really breathtaking and superbly done.  The most important thing that was achieved is that the producers of this film captured the essence of Narnia.  You really feel like you've been to Narnia and to me that makes the film tremendously powerful.  The death and resurrection of Aslan were really fantastic, and I also especially liked the Lucy/Tumnus meeting and also when the children grew up in Narnia and were looking for the White Stag.  How did they get adult actors who looked SO much like the children, I'd like to know?!  Well done!  Georgie Henley was terrific in this movie and really stole the show.  She was the perfect Lucy.  The casting for this film was really well done. The only character I did not care for was The White Witch.  In other movie versions, perhaps the role is \"over-played\" and so because of that the role seemed to be \"under-played\" in this case.  I don't know if a happy medium exists to be truthful.  The producers did maintain the Christian symbolism, that C.S. Lewis called \"a supposal\" not an allegory, but this was not overly obvious.  The film certainly can be appreciated in  different ways.Some of the minor changes to the storyline and dialogue did irritate me, just because I know the novel SO well.  I would have liked more of Lewis' humour to be maintained instead of the humour that was added by the screenwriters.  Most noticeably is the absence of the development of Mrs. Beaver with her cute statements about the bread knife & sewing machine.  They also removed the scene in which the animals were having a party with food & drink given to them by Father Christmas - you know the part where the witch turns them into stone.  Instead they developed the fox character and used him alone in this altered scenerio.  I felt some of the dialogue & scene changes were a little unnecessary from a purist's perspective.  Some of the scenes also seemed rushed to me and I would have liked to see the hideout \"for beavers in bad times\".  I know, they had a time limit and actually the movie is over 2 hours which is longer than most movies.  What they did with the time they had was really really well done.  Hopefully we'll get some of these \"deleted scenes\" on the dvd.As someone else mentioned, there is a surprise 30 seconds into the credits that you will not want to miss.Some parents have expressed concern about the violence quotient, but I went into the movie with a 7-year old in mind and I think it will be okay for MOST younger children.  There are the battle scenes and they show one person being killed with an arrow.  However, they never dwell long on the battle and no blood is shown.  The other part that is disturbing is the part with Tumnus in the dungeon and the implication is that he was tortured.  That was rather upsetting and of course Aslan being killed was also very scary.  But, they have presented these tastefully & sensitively.  Actually the previews for other Disney films were more scary than the main attraction! :-)My overall impression - EXCELLENT and I hope they make all 7 books into movies.\n",
      "I always loved to pretend as a kid and this movie is all about that and more. Such beautiful animation and graphics and the story just made me cry (not in a bad way). I read all the books and I am an adult; loved them and love the movie even more. It is a joy to watch.\n",
      "This movie was a joy to watch. The cinematography was gorgeous. The children were great picks for the parts they played-especially little Lucy. I am really anticipating the others in the series. The mythical beasts were also very well done-from the lion to the unicorn to the satyrs. This movie is beautifully done and should be equally enjoyed by adults as well as children of all ages.\n",
      "Such an exciting and suspenseful movie! Loved all of the characters and voices of animals/creatures. Beautiful settings and music too\n",
      "World War II is raging, bombs are falling on London, and children are being evacuated to the safety of the country.  The four Pevensie children, Peter, Edmond, Susan, and Lucy, are sent to live in a big house owned by an old professor.  One day they discover an old wardrobe in the attic...that just happens to be the portal to the magical kingdom of Narnia.  There, it is always winter, but never Christmas, thanks to the evil White Witch.  Opposing her is King Aslan, mighty lion and defender of all that is good.  The children must gather all their courage as they prepare for the final battle between the two sides.Almost everyone and everything we see is CGI, which is stunning!  The four children are natural and convincing. The first half of the story is very slow but the huge finale is worth the wait.  CGI Aslan is such a  sympathetic creature that there were few dry eyes in the theatre during his big scene,  and the Christian allegory is quite touching.  This is a very satisfying film for Narnia fans of all ages.  (Note:  Be sure and stay for the end credits to see a final scene with Lucy and the Professor.)Kona\n",
      "Finally! Good gracious, praise the Lord! Man, you have no idea how long I've been waiting for this. I saw the animated movies when I was little, and I was ecstatic when they came out with this one. I saw it the first day it came out with my little sister and mother. They both loved it. Anna Popplewell did a great job! And it doesn't hurt that Skandar Keynes and William Moseley are gorgeous! Give this movie a try, you won't regret it.\n",
      "\"The Chronicles Of Narnia\" is excellent! One of the best fantasy movies based on novels since \"The Lord Of The Rings\" movies. Andrew Adamson's (one of the writers and directors of the \"Shrek\" movies) directing is excellent. The screenplay by Adamson, Ann Peacock, Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, based on C.S. Lewis' book is excellent. The Oscar-winning make-up effects by KNB FX are impressive. The music by Harry Gregson-Williams (nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Score) is impressive, as well as Alanis Morissette's \"Wunderkind\" (nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song). The cinematography by Donald McAlpine (Oscar-nominated for his work on \"Moulin Rouge\" (2001) is excellent. The film editing by Sim Evan-Jones & Jim May is excellent. The casting by Sameer Bhardwaj, Pippa Hall, Liz Mullane (Casting director on Peter Jackson's \"The Lord Of The Rings: Return Of The King\" (2003) & \"King Kong\" (2005) & Gail Stevens is excellent. The production Design by Roger Ford (Oscar-nominated for his work on \"Babe\" (1995) is impressive. The art direction by Jules Cook (worked on the \"Lord Of The Rings\" movies & \"The Matrix\" (1999) & \"The Matrix Revolutions (2003), Ian Gracie (worked on the last 2 \"Star Wars\" prequels), Karen Murphy (worked on the last 2 \"Star Wars\" prequels & \"The Matrix Revolutions\" (2003) & Jeffrey Thorp is impressive. The set decoration by Kerrie Brown (Oscar-nominated for her work on \"Babe\" (1995) is impressive. The costume design by Isis Mussenden (worked on \"Shrek 2\" (2004) is impressive.\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia is a fantastic movie. Beautiful translation of the book. Would highlyrecommend the blu-ray of it. Now our Narnia collection is complete!\n",
      "Loved this movie! Action, suspense, all without cursing, nudity...wonderful family film. Underlying message of hope, salvation goes well with entire film.\n",
      "This is a great movie for children of all ages. It is also entertaining to watch again as an adult. Even years after its release the effects and characters get you emotionally involved with the script.\n",
      "This movie is so well done. It's visually stimulating and sparks the imagination of the child inside us. I watched it with my 5 year old grandson. He had seen it before and he had something to say about every scene. Going inside a wardrobe and coming out on the other side in a magical land where you are declared royalty in a land with half people and half animals... it's the stuff epic dreams are made of. I'd highly recommend it.\n",
      "I saw this film when it came out because I liked the book a lot. When I first saw it, I liked it, but I did not love it. In my 10th grade year, my drama class watched this film and...actually, I liked it a lot more. And now it is one of my favorite films. Is the film better than the book....eh, I don't know. You decide. The story is about 4 kids named Peter,Susan,Edmund,and Lucy who have been sent to live in the home of a professor due to the war. One day,Lucy finds a wardrobe that leads her to a magical world named Narnia. She eventually leads her siblings into the wardrobe and then realize that they have to fight The White Witch. There are a lot of great performances. Tilda Swinton is great as the White Witch. She manages to be threatening and intimidating all at the same time. Though I must admit, her costumes are a bit Lady Gaga-ish. Any who, the performances of the kids are excellent, especially from Georgie Henley. This film is Lucy's story, and we see it from her eyes. And Henley carries the story all the way through. The score is outstanding. Especially the battle sequence. The soundtrack is so good in fact, I actually have it on my Zune. The special effects are very good, and there are some very creative moments and character designs. There are some flaws, but other than that, this is a wonderful family film that pushes the envelope. And it is just a fun family adventure. I highly recommend this film\n",
      "I never have read the books, but I thought this movie was very good.  It kept me interested.\n",
      "Beautiful movie both aesthetically and emotionally. One for the kids at first impression but withholds a powerful, even life transforming message within. Brilliance!\n",
      "The extended scenes in the new cut really add to the film experience.  The featurettes and behind the scenes specials are incredible.  The best part of the set is the brand new documentary on the life of C.S. Lewis.  It is very informative and so well done.  Well worth taking a look at.\n",
      "This was a refreshing movie from beginning to end.  The movie would probably be best suited for older children, teens and adults due to the scary figures in places, the good vs. evil theme and the overall plot.  Since the movie contained many allegories it could be called a story within a story which lends itself to much learning for kids and adults alike.  This version has caused me to want to not only read the Narnia books, but compare some of the other movie versions as well.  This movie was both relaxing and thought provoking.  I would recommend it!\n",
      "I can't say I have ever enjoyed sitting down and watching a movie any more than when I saw The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. It was such a brilliant film, I can't wait to watch it over and over. I loved each of the four childrens acting and it was so refreshing to see actors that haven't acted in a dozen films before. They each deserve a breakdown.William Moseley- He was totally believable as his role of Peter. He was the perfect big brother and his character really grew through the movie. At the begining of the film you can't quite see how he will lead an army but he really met the challenge.Anna Popplewell- Didn't you just love that english accent. She was really great as Susan. Rather bossy and sassy to begin with until her talk with Lucy at the stream.Skandar Keynes- Yup, he was the bratty kid from the book. He just had those eyes that you could tell were mischevious.Georgie Henley- personally my favorite from the movie. No previous acting and yet she had a magic to her that was captivating. She had the imagination of Lucy and you could her sense of wonder in Narnia.Narnia was simply the best movie of the year and to me one of the best alltime.\n",
      "This is by far one of the best movies this year. This classic tale was depicted with such style and elegance. It's a movie the whole family is guaranteed to enjoy...I LOVED IT!!\n",
      "The first film from C.S. Lewis' masterpiece novel out of seven books that was adapted extremely way to the big screen that I have since seeing it in theatres in 2005 that was a big success with many people all over the world with $783 million worldwide for Disney and a Oscar winner for Best Makeup. It is sad that the Narnia movies are over after Dawn Treader became the third and last movie of this series while the movies are in process of being rebooted and we can't imagine a remake of this movie.\n",
      "We like this version. We have the BBC version and though it is entertaining, the Disney production is far superior.\n",
      "I saw the BBC production of \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,\" the first installment of \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" by C.S. Lewis, and even though it had an animatronic Aslan the magic worked because everybody treated it as if it were alive. That same principle holds true for the theatrical version that opened today. The four siblings who enter the land of Narnia through the wardrobe accept what is happening and where they are as well as the responsibilities that fall to them in that land, and we believe as well. This is also because the children come across as being real, consistent in their personality traits until they learn better or the situation compels them to grow up accordingly.The four Pevensie children are sent by their mother from a London that is being blizted nightly by Nazi bombers to stay in the country with Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent). They are under instructions from the housekeeper, Mrs. MacReady (Elizabeth Hawthorne), to basically do none of the things that children do. It is while playing a game that is probably forbidden that the youngest, Lucy (Georgie Henley), discovers there is more to the wardrobe in the spare room than meets the eye. Her siblings, Peter (William Moseley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Susan (Anna Popplewell) do not believe her until they see for themselves. But then they discover that the magic that is Narnia is not as white as the driven snow when they meet up with the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).Unlike many of these big production children's movies this one is filled with mostly unfamiliar faces. Popplewell is the only one of the kids with more than a single credit. Broadbent is the most recognizable face, but he has a minor part. James Cosmo, who plays Father Christmas, will look familiar but few will place his name and there will be those who swear that it is Cate Blanchett who is playing the White Witch. Liam Neeson is cast perfectly as the voice of Aslan and once you recognize it is him you can forget who is doing the voice and just enjoy the story. Similarly, when Aalan makes his sacrifice the Christian allegory of Lewis' story becomes patently obvious, but the story still works for those who see Azlan and think of \"The Lion King\" rather than Jesus Christ. That is why \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" is the most powerful and popular Christian allegory of the 20th century, and why few fans will find fault with this cinematic adaptation.Director Andrew Adamson helmed all of the \"Shrek\" movies, where the pop culture references flew fast and furious. In this film he casts his creative net even further in bringing together familiar images and magical moments. I was reminded of Dorothy discovering the Technicolor land over the rainbow in \"The Wizard of Oz,\" the train trip to Hogwarts in \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" and the great clash of armies from \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.\" When the Witch shows up in her polar bear drawn chariot I was reminded of Frank Frazetta's cover painting for \"The Eternal Warrior\" and the last time we see Aslan recalls Mary Stevenson Parker's inspirational poem \"Footprints.\" So a lot of what is in this movie will resonate with a lot of viewers, which is totally fitting given the chronicles related by Lewis.They did a superb job on the packaging for this two-disc collector's edition.  The DVDs are in a case that has nothing on the cover but the wardrobe, which I learned has carvings that tell the story of \"The Magician's Nephew,\" which is Lewis' prequel to this story.  That fits into a box and when you remove it reveals Lucy in Narnia by the lamppost in the snow.  Disc 1 has the movie and the blooper reel.  You can watch the movie again with commentary by either the kids and the director or by other filmmakers for more of the technical aspects.  You can also turn on the Narnia Fun Facts that will pop up throughout the film.  Disc 2 has featurettes representing the two world of Narnia.  Creating Narnia has bits that look at the director, the children, the creation of the film, the life and work of C.S. Lewis, and various cinematic storytellers.  The common denominator here is that this was clearly a labor of love.  Then the Creatures, Lands & Legends part looks at the various creatures from legend that populate Narnia.  Final Note: Be sure to watch the credits because there is a scene right after the cast credits.  Plus, there is an Alanis Morisette song, \"Wunderkind\" to listen to as well to let the movie play out to the end.\n",
      "C.S. Lewis writes many different kinds of books.  The movie was just as good as the book.  I've watched it several times.\n",
      "I like this movie but the second one was kinda crappy and off story the third one was ok ll\n",
      "Great movie! I need to order the 2nd one...amazon is fast....friendly and the returns are usually fast except when you're not dealing with amazon n it's another party that's not nice at all so I have to watch where my stuff is coming from .\n",
      "I am a great fan of the Chronicles of Narnia. Basically this a good movie, the effects are great and so are the actors. But this movie has a serious flaw. Because the Narnian stories are not huge action stories, C.S Lewis relied on depth,feeling,and magic to make his stories the classics they became. Unfortunatley, the movie is robbed of much of the magic that made the story a classic. For example,the witch is turned from an evil and cunning sorceris into a cruel and unstopable warrior queen, Aslan is devoid of his power and authority and is little more than a imposing talking lion. And the movie is minus some of the most powerful scenes in the book. From the battle to the end of the movie was excellent, but the rest of the movie just didn't compare to the book or the audio cd. Final point- don't watch this until you read the book and listen to the dramatised cds by focus on the family. See you on my next review of the 2003 movie Hulk.\n",
      "This is a classic movie, just like the book. The cinematography and special effects are wonderful. Everyone in the family loved the movie.\n",
      "I bought this for my granddaughter who has the 2nd and 3rd movies from the series.  She had never seen this one.  I am sure she will love it as I did.\n",
      "If I could give it more than 5 stars, I certainly would! I'm a pretty big Narnia fan, and very much enjoyed the extra footage offered in this version. One of the DVDs in this 4-disc set is loaded with information on the man who wrote the book the film is based on, C. S. Lewis. It comes in a really nice box that would be great for gift-giving, too.Definitely has a place of honor on my DVD shelf. :-)\n",
      "Most people who would go to see this movie have most likely read the story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe or have heard a lot about it.My father bought me The Chronicles of Narnia when I was ten and when I had read all the stoies I was hoping to find a movie or a video game for at least one of the books, and after a short time of searching, I found out that The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was coming out at the end of the year.Then when I finally went to see it, I was quite happy to discover that the movie was very loyal to the book.It starts out as the four Pevensies, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy leave their home in London and go to stay with a professor in the country.During their stay, Lucy goes through a wardrobe into a different world where she finds out that a whitch has the land under a spell that causes it to be winter there all the time, but no Christmas.One of the four betrays the others by telling the White Witch that they are in Narnia.Will the power of the son of the Great Emperor Across the Sea and his army be enough to conquer the Witch and her army? You'll just have to watch the movie to fin out how the war goes.\n",
      "I love all the books.  I have read them to my children several times.  The movie is very close to the book.  What helps to accept the slight changes made is the control Donald Grishem had over the project.  We bought the DVD with the extra bonus material on it - it is well worth it.  My boys enjoy watching the bonus material as much as the movie.  It helps explain why the movie, the director made a few slight changes from the book.  These slight changes only enhanses the story.  I am amazed at the pettiness of some viewers who are upset over the slightest detail not being exactly like the book. Regardless of the changes, it is a beautiful movie that captures the essence of CS Lewis' masterpiece.  The musical score is perfect, moving, thrilling!  I am a musician and I am picky about film scores.  I'm not very happy about the music for the credits, though.  It does seem a little out of place.  But that's all.  As for Aslan's voice, Aslan is three dementional, therefore it is important that he not sound like Darth Vader.  Liam does a tender, commanding, and emotional portrayal of Aslan. The children are very good, spontaneous, refreshing.  Peter holds the four children together as we see him grow from his insecurities into a king.  There have been some complaints that Susan is too mean.  Susan is not mean, however the actress needed to portray her such that it is no surprise in the later books when Susan chooses not to believe in such childish things, therefore, never going back to Narnia.  It works well in the movie.  The spirit of Narnia lives in this movie and in all the characters, actors, and crew who worked hard to make it live.  One must feel somewhat sorry for others so wrapped up in the letter of Narnia that they do not catch or feel the spirit of Narnia.  I think Aslan would just shake his head in wonderment.  As far as CS Lewis - I feel strongly he would approve of his masterpiece and would be thrilled with the slight changes, especially the end.  CS Lewis believed in the spirit of Narnia and had no ego regarding his work.To appreciate the White Witch you need to read Magician's Nephew.  The director portrayed her perfectly.  On the bonus material of the DVD, the director mentioned that he avoided a typical female villan such as wicked witch, evil queen.  Therefore he went for someone unexpected.  She was internally demonic and quietly seething which made her role more evil instead of playing her over the top.  The battle scene is her forte.  She is Jadis - tall, strong and twisted.As far as Disney - Disney marketed the film, but they were restricted from offering advice or making changes to the production.  This is marketed through Disney, but it is not a Disney film.  Big difference.  When others state it is a typical Disney film, they are mistaken.  Some complain that the characters are stock with the typical Disney villan and happy Disney ending.  Good grief, read the book!Now, for those true Narnia lovers - Focus On The Family has all of the Narnia stories recreated in a radio theater format with  actors, orchestrations and sound effects.  We have all of them and my boys, 16 and 12, still listen to them weekly.  It is a wonderful way to get to know the other books as well.Life's too short to miss out on Narnia.  Get the DVD and enjoy the story and the best bonus material I have seen yet.\n",
      "Bringing a classic to life...This movie is well done.  Cast is well suited and true to the story.  Great movie for the kids.\n",
      "Visually stunning, and cast with endearing characters, this was a far more enjoyable film than I ever expected.  I don't know how this could have been done better without making it a much longer movie.Here's all the stuff I loved about this movie:It drew me right in from the beginning in a way I didn't expect.The children were very believable to me.  They acted just as school children of that time period would act, at least to me anyway.Soundtrack that fit perfectly and complimented the story while not overwhelming the visuals and the acting.I really believed those animals were talking!  Surely some breakthroughs were made in CGI.  The voices cast were appropriate for each of the animals.Battle scenes with intensity but not gore.An epic story of betrayal and redemption that one doesn't necessarily need to be a Christian to enjoy.I'll want to watch it through with the commentary tracks someday too.  Here's hoping for sequels!\n",
      "\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" shows an adventure meant for families and all ages to enjoy. Children notice the special effects and characters; adults can analyze the symbolic meaning of the lion and the White Witch. Although nothing directly parallels to the story of the bible, it comes very close. It is a very controversial issue, with many views and opinions. Aslan, the lion, is a god like character who comes to save Narnia from the White Witch who is trying to keep Narnia cold and icy forever. There is a scene where the lion (\"god\") is to be killed by the witch in order to have peace in Narnia. This scene is the crucifixion like scene that has most people asking the question \"Is this movie one of Christian faith?\" The wardrobe represents a spiritual like realm. The characters Lucy, Edmond, Peter and Susan act as defenders in the battle between good and evil; they are the children of Adam and Eve. These factors represent Christian faith, and they show an amazing sense of adventure. For the younger audience there's the chance for imagination to take a hold. Narnia opens possibilities in young minds, which can further a child's thinking enabling them to be more open minded. Susan, the youngest sibling, wanders into the wardrobe during a game of hide and seek, to discover Narnia. The adventure takes off from there, allowing our minds to wander in this world of imagination. This film is definitely seen in different perspectives which make it easy for many people to enjoy.\n",
      "This is one of the best movies out there.  I wish I had seen it on the big screen because it is just magical.  I have seen it over 10 times and love it every time.\n",
      "This series is about understanding the gift of faith and how it aught to operate. Facing known and unknown fears each character gains personal knowledge of their faith and the depth to which they can experience it.\n",
      "It was an excellent movie at a great price. I usually look at Amazon first when I am puchasing any book or dvd(The cronicles of Naria- The lion,the witch and the wardrobe) wouldn't be available anywhere else.I tried to get a copy in the store and they weren't carrying anymore. Amazon isthe best.  I ordered a book from them recently and the price was reasonable and the book comes in excelent condition.\n",
      "Like most people today, I saw the movie before reading the book. When I saw this movie in theaters when I was 13, I fell in love with this movie instantly. But when I read the book, I was disappointed in it. I thought that the book was going to be much more epic than the film, like it usually is, but boy was I wrong. The book was so mild it felt like a 5 year old could read it due to the very little violence it contained. This is one of those rare instances in which the film is so much better than the book. A lot of people today crave the excitement from epic scenes and battles in movies and this is a great case in which it is just as beautiful as it is epic and I love those films to death. So if you haven't read the book yet, prepare to be disappointed in how mild it is.\n",
      "I purchased this to show to my students after we read the novel. It is so much easier having it on my account than trying to find the DVD every year.\n",
      "Just a wonderful make believe experience that was well done and quite enjoyable for the entire family to watch on a lazy afternoon\n",
      "A wonderful movie and in 100% mint condition on arrival. Not just for kids to watch, but great for adults who love a fantasy story.\n",
      "Love this movie. Great detail and a great message. Read the books first and we'll worth It! You won't be disappointed.\n",
      "Like J.R.R. Tolkien (Lord of the Rings), Lewis wrote a fairy tale to get over the horror of WW II.  In a way, this is a story for children, but in another way, it is a way to avoid the horrors of war and find a world where truth and justice make sence.I haven't been a kid in many years, but this DVD took me back to when I was, and I would hope that kids today would understand why it is a wonderful story.This is an excellent product.  If you have a child you are trying to save from the current media nastiness, buy it!!!!\n",
      "I am 54 and recently reread the entire series. I have watched this movie over and over. I hope they make them all into movies! On a rather down afternoon this movie has made me feel better.\n",
      "What a fantastic movie.  I saw it last night and it was really magical.  The story came flooding back to me from my school days and it came to life just as you'd imagine it in your mind as you read the book.  The scenery was spectacular and the kids were great actors.  Lucy was adorable and very believable.  You must see this.  It's best on the big screen, but no matter how you see it, just see it.  It will blow you away with the beautiful settings and the special effects are top notch.  Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie for everyone over a certain age (I can imagine parts might be too dark or disturbing at times for kids under 10), but whilst this isn't normally the genre of movie I enjoy or see often, this was a great break from my norm.  It will really take you away.\n",
      "This movie was well done and very captivating, but definitely not for young children. There are some very, scary creatures. Great story and special effects!\n",
      "When we said we were going to watch The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, *everyone* asked, \"The cartoon version?\"  What? There's a cartoon version? NO!  THIS is THE version to watch!!  Very well done- even the 4 yr old sat spellbound through the whole thing, and the 5 yr old didn't even ask a question until it was over (she was that entranced!).  Watch this version, it will make you feel better.\n",
      "The Narnia DVD's are wonderful versions of the great CS Lewis series. They show us about the essence of living, loving and working together. Wonderful for children & adults. If we really understood the 'deep magic' of life, we would find true Life!\n",
      "We thoroughly enjoyed this movie and plan to watch it many times! It catches the main points of the book well enough (for us who have read them all), but is clear enough for those who have never read the book to understand what C. S. Lewis was writing about. Loved it!\n",
      "We took our Grandson to see this movie, It is exactly as explained, Fantasy.  My Grandson enjoyed this movie and it never went out of context of being a fantasy story.  He liked it so much that he wanted all the books of Narnia which he bought himself with money he earned and saved.  One viewer complained that it teaches the wrong lesson about god and witch craft.  But I believe if you keep it where it belongs as a fairytale and just enjoy the story, what is the harm.  We all need a little fantasy in our life.  Great special affects as well.\n",
      "We read The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe to our five year olds and promised to watch the movie with them when we had finished.  It was so magical to watch with them as their favorite characters came to life.  As a long-time fan of the Narnia series, I think this movie is absolutely beauitful.\n",
      "So happy to order this ahead of time before it came out in the stores.  Everyone came over to watch, what a great time!\n",
      "Movie makers continually seek out new opportunities to show the world what modern technology can do.  It was probably inevitable that C.S. Lewis's books about Narnia would eventually become a film.  Fortunately, this version is nicely filmed and the special effects are phenomenal.  Avid fans will likely be disappointed because the film takes a lot of liberties with the plot, but everyone else will find this movie fun to watch.During the bombing of London early in World War II, many families sent their children into the countryside.  This plot device has been used in other movies, including at least one other well-known Disney movie, \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks.\"  This movie focuses on four Pevensie children, Peter, Lucie, Edmund and Susan.  The four children are being boarded with Professor Kirke.  Professor Kirke is reclusive and eccentric.  The children eventually discover an old wardrobe that can lead to another world, a world called Narnia.Once in Narnia the children discover that they are part of a prophecy.  The children also learn much about themselves and develop many positive attributes, including compassion, trust, and responsibility.  Most importantly, they learn the power of love and caring for each other.  The children learn these lessons while helping the creatures of Narnia, including Aslan, their leader.Narnia is a magical place caught in a battle between good, represented by Aslan, and evil, represented by the White Witch, who aspires to be the Queen of Narnia.  The four children represent a change in the balance of power that has lasted for one hundred years.  Though the children have their doubts and fears, they have an opportunity to cast their fears aside and to help an entire world change for the better.I have seen many movies based on books.  The most difficult books to film are those based on fantasy because these stories typically rely as much on the characters as they do on the imagery of the stories.  Unfortunately, many film makers fail to understand the distinction between a good story and special effects.  Fortunately for us, the producer and director of this movie did understand the difference and they created a very enjoyable film to inspire us all.This film does have a fair amount of violence, and some younger children and most pre-school children should probably watch the movie only with a parent present.The DVD has a lot of special features.  The special feature that I enjoyed the most is the pop-up version of the movie.  All sorts of tidbits appear with this feature turned on that expand on C.S. Lewis's life and on the Narnia books.  The only problem with this feature is that there are lengthy periods when there are no pop-ups and I was a bit restless in the wait.\"The Chronicles of Narnia:  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" is a very good adaptation of the first book of Narnia by C.S. Lewis.  The movie does take liberties with the plot and deviates several times from C.S. Lewis's story.  However, the movie does retain the flavor of C.S. Lewis's book and is a worthy addition to the film libraries of most families and those who enjoy a good fantasy film.Enjoy!\n",
      "As a longtime fan of the books, I was excited to see the film version of \"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\". The film is practically a blueprint of the book, with minor changes, but nothing too altering. The idea of finding a magical land, and being a child again, and good beating out evil...it's all there.I would like to mention though that the widspread problem of the missing booklet was QUITE a hassle....If anyone else had this problem, call the Disney phone number that's listed in the link to the photo of the booklet in product details, or else you'll have the problem I did: A Christmas present missing a piece, many emails back and forth to Amazon customer service, a replacement DVD sent STILL missing the booklet, returns, and eventually finding out I could get the booklet sent to me for free anyway. Better late than never, I suppose.\n",
      "I thought this film was great. It had a few differences from the actual book but it was awesome all the same. I would recommend this film to children, teenagers, and adults!\n",
      "I give \"The Cronicles of Narnia all three series five plus stars.  My family and I have enjoyed it, and we will for many years to come.\n",
      "Normally I write a movie review by approaching the script and the job done by the director, summarizing the plot a little and praising or panning various performances and CGI.I don't think I need to do that with \"Narnia\".  I reveled in the books as a child, and I found the film experience to be...thrilling.  Beautiful.  Engrossing.  Spectacular.  I hung on every word and scene.  A visual feast.  Bravo to the filmmakers!\n",
      "I always enjoyed the 7 books of the series. This version of LW&W makes good use of computer graphics effects - some of the best I'd seenwhen I first saw the film at the cinema. This is worth buying if you enjoy fantasy-sci-fi type films. Looking forward to Prince Caspian on DVD, and hoping they make the remaining 5 in the book series.\n",
      "I was first introduced to Narnia in the fourth grade when my teacher read it aloud to us during break time after lunch. Since then I have worn out two sets of paperbacks. I have read them so many times that my paperbacks are falling apart. I have been anxious for many years for someone to make a well made film of the Chronicles and I was thrilled when I found out that Disney was undertaking the challenge through Walden Media. Both are excellent film production companies. There are a few changes to the original story that I found a little irritating, but after waiting so long for something other than the 1970's cartoon and the very cheaply made and poorly acted BBC version, I didn't mind those changes much at all. The actors playing the four Pevensies were excellently casted, especially Lucy, who is absolutely darling and the special effects are stunning. Anyone who thinks it looks cheap or poorly made, I can only say to you that you must think it's easy to make half-human/half-animal creatures and talking animals look realistic. I thought they were wonderful. I am excited to see the next film in the Chronicles of Narnia and I can hardly wait for it to come out!\n",
      "Just wonderful!  It is a fantasy yet you could feel yourself being pulled into the story as it progressed.\n",
      "I love the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis. The stories are fascinating and meaningful. But I think my imagination is better than the movie! The special effects were very impressive, and the four children look extremely English, as they should. But I actually kind of liked the old made-for-tv miniseries better than this version! Still, it's a story worth a remake, if for no other reason than to introduce a new generation to the magical, intriguing world of Narnia!\n",
      "I love this movie...I love the fantasy behind it. It is a fantasy rags-to-riches story and promotes imagination, loyalty, family, and bravery. This is one of my favorite movies.\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia appealed to the kid in me. It is beautifully filmed and the young actors build a great story. Just wonderful entertainment!\n",
      "I have watched all three Narnias and I love the first one and the third one.  It is an incredibly well-done movie that is extremely enjoyable for all ages. I bought it for our family collection and plan to buy the third Narnia--or maybe I'll get it from one of my children for Christmas.\n",
      "This was a great movie that my whole family enjoyed.  I think its suitable for a mature 8 year old and up.\n",
      "So often movies adapted from books are bad or not too bad, this movie was great, it was as close to my imagination as I read the book a few years back, worth watching many times.\n",
      "First I have to say I never read the original book, but this still seemed like a fair and well done attempt to bring the much-loved C.S. Lewis story to the screen. The characters were believable and the four children did a wonderful job with their roles. The special effects are stunning, the best I've seen since LOTR. The battle scene at the end between good and evil was a worthy climax to the film and I might even like it better than the final battle in LOTR. Another very cool thing was the adult actors looked very much like their childhood counterparts. It gets off to a bit of a slow start, and here and there you'll find a few other places where things drag a bit, but not for long, and the final 20 minutes of the movie are great, nonstop action, especially the big battle scene. Overall a fine movie and one that seems to represent well the famous Lewis story.\n",
      "I bought this set as a gift for my grandchildren for Christmas.  They really loved the story and sat watching it with big wide eyes.  They are 4 and 8.  I was a little disappointed in the set I thought I was getting a set of 3 different stories but it was a set of how they made the movie and other trivia.  I guess that was my fault for not doing more research on themovie.\n",
      "I didn't read any of C.S. Lewis' books, so this review does not focus on how successful the movie was at capturing the essence of the book. Rather, it focuses on the 2 disc collector's edition and the movie as a whole.The movie amazed me with its special effects, animated creatures and landscapes (once again, New Zealand has got to have some of the most beautiful places on Earth). They were all beautifully captured through a blend of great photography work and computer animation detail, seamlessly complemented by the accomplishments of the production design, costume and props teams. My favorite animated characters, hands down, were the beaver couple and the Lion, of course. And among the nicest sets too was the beavers' house, which brought to mind Yoda's home from \"Empire Strikes Back\" (please don't ask me why).The story was interesting, but the way it was told in the movie, it had numerous moments (past the first half, most of them) where it felt a bit too forced in order to make things work. This took away from the first half of the movie, where there was plenty of detail to help justify the direction that things would take. Perhaps too many editorial cuts, perhaps a failure on the screenplay to capture some important elements: the end result feels a bit rushed (story-wise) and takes away from how believable Director Andrew Adamson (\"Shrek\") wanted it to be.The work by the actors was fine, particularly the job done by Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes, the two youngest children actors (first timers, all) who played Lucy and Edmund, respectively. Tilda Swinton (from \"The Beach\" and many other movies) played a White Witch that worked, by staying away from clichés. The Lion's voice, done by Liam Neeson, could not be better. It conveyed all the respect and fear (when needed) that the character required.The rest of the 2-disc set has plenty of goodies for the fans of C.S. Lewis and those who love to learn about the innermost details of the movie and its pre-production, production and post-production phases. As a whole package, it works, and it even offers two beautifully crafted and printed pieces of concept art (the size of a postcard) for the buyer to collect.Overall, things even out a bit in the end and the Special Two-Disc Collector's Edition of \"The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" lands a comfortable 4 stars out of 5.\n",
      "A family movie in which one does not feel the lumps in the theater seats.\n",
      "This is the best version of \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" I have ever seen. The BBC version wasn't that great because they couldn't do the things that they did in this one, and the animated version was just all right. The acting, visual effects, and scenery in this film are very good. The only thing I would change is having a few more special features on this DVD such like a few games and stuff like that, but other than that it's a great film and a good special edition DVD.\n",
      "Our whole family just went to see Narnia. It was awesome. We all loved it and didn't want it to end. My kids are Harry Potty freaks and they both rate this above Harry. The casting was great. Peter is very cute.One word to those that haven't seen it...don't be in a hurry to leave when the credits start to roll...trust me.Have fun in Narnia!!!\n",
      "I don't know what makes you think this has a lot to do with LOTR.  I mean it's not a break off of it, it's based on a book that C.S. Lewis had written for children to get a better understanding of the Bible.  Yes there are talking creatures and creepy looking creatures but that gives you an idea what it's like with God on oneside and Satan on the other.  That is of course you like to look at it in a Christian perspectiveThis movie really does run parallel with the Bible, in a way.  You the White Witch, a.k.a Satan, and you have Aslan, a.k.a God.  One fights for freedom, the other fights for control.  Your basic good vs. evil battle. For the adults of course.For the kids there is the funny, talking animals.  Well some of them anyways.  There is no gore for all you \"I must see blood in order to like this movie\" so don't see it if you want to see blood everywhere.  There is adventure, the occasional dangerous encounters with the evil wolves, and the almost drowning in the river.I think the most scariest part for the kids probably is when Aslan goes to the Stone Table to sacrifice his life instead of Edmund.  It's a fightening seen with all the creepy goblins and strange looking creatures and of course the dopey elf-thingy who drives the White Witche's sleigh.  The fact that they don't show Jadis thrusting the knife into Aslan, just showing her with it poised over her head and then her claiming the \"Great Lion\" dead, is a big relief because I don't young kids would be able to handle that all.It's all really good movie and it does have good morals.  I do suggest though that kids who are really young shouldn't probably watch this because of scary monsters and intense scenes.  Otherwise, this is a wonderful movie for all ages and not a movie for people who love sex and gore.\n",
      "I love watching this movie on my 3d blue ray tv. I will be looking for more movies like this\n",
      "This is an awesome movie.  I recommend it for every one.  Young and old.  We will watch it many times.  We seen this movie while visiting friends in Wyoming and just had to have it for our own.  C S Lewis does an awesome job on this one..\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Full Screen Edition)Very enjoyable movie with winsom characters and fine special effects. Nice family movie. Nice fantasy movie for people that are tired of having half dressed characters and expletives be a part of every movie. I enjoyed it and so did my family. Plan to get Narnia, Prince Caspian this week.\n",
      "Ever since I first discovered Narnia in the third grade, I have loved this series of seven novels.  While I have read through the series several times, this book remains my favorite and I have read it more then any other.Naturally, when I first heard about this movie, I was excited.  I tried to keep a healthy skepticism about me since so very few movies live up to their books, but I couldn't help it.  I was counting the days until I got to see this.  And I was not disappointed in the least.Sticking fairly closely to the book, the story follows four siblings.  Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are sent to the countryside to live with a professor while the Germans bomb London during World War II.  While playing hide and seek one day, Lucy (Georgie Henley) hides in a wardrobe, only to find herself in a winter landscape.  Exploring a little more, she meets a faun named Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy).  After serving her tea, he confesses his desire to turn her over to the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton).  The White Witch has turned his country of Narnia into a constant winter with no Christmas.Naturally, her siblings don't believe a word Lucy says when she returns.  A second trip with Edmund in tow doesn't help things.  But when all four of them wind up in Narnia, they find themselves caught in an epic battle between good and evil where they are prophesied to free Narnia from the White Witch's reign with the help of the great lion Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson).  But even if they can survive treachery in their own ranks, can four children really free Narnia?The movie expertly captures the spirit of the book while making lots of changes.  Those familiar with the original story will certainly notice a few changes already (hide and seek was the excuse the second time Lucy went, not the first), but these changes enhance the movie.  This is especially true in the middle third.  The trip from the Beaver's house to meet Aslan was much more harrowing in the movie and Edmund gets some extra scenes never dreamed of for the book.  The changes were actually necessary to make the story work for the movie.  Most of them help establish the changes the characters are going through, which is handled in the narration of the book.  Obviously, that isn't an option for the movie.As I said, these changes didn't bother me in the least.  I was so caught up in the story I didn't care.  The kids do an absolutely amazing job with the acting, especially since they are doing lots of acting to effects that won't be there until much later.  Georgie Henley, the youngest as Lucy, especially does a good job, which is important since Lucy has to carry so much of the early story by herself.  I was also quite satisfied with Aslan's voice.  Liam Neeson brings the right mix of majesty with reality to the role.  And Tilda Swinton's White Witch is equal parts creepy and evil without being over the top.The effects were amazing as well.  This movie could not have been made 5 years ago.  While a few of the creatures might look a little fake to some, I want to know where they found the talking beasts.  And the scenery, taken from locations all over the world but mostly New Zealand, was beautiful as well.Even though the movie is rated PG, parents will want to take the rating seriously.  There are several intense moments, especially the opening of London being bombed and the final battle.  In keeping with the PG rating, the final battle is (thankfully) blood free, but it might be too intense for kids.  Only you can judge for your family.Every hope I had for this movie was met or exceeded.  I hope they do all seven of the books.  In the meantime, I can not wait to see this one again.\n",
      "Our family loves these movies for a Sunday afternoon or any day.  The story has great allegorical value for teaching our little ones and lots of adventure and action to keep them engaged too.\n",
      "The movie was excellent.  It did the book justice. Great family fun for both old and new.\n",
      "This is CLEARLY Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter for people who think that Rings and Potter are for witches and Satanists. Although Narnia has those things in it, the characters are CLEARLY based on the Bible and Torah although the names and faces are different. Very clean for kids(no cussing, sex, or gore) but the violence(war scenes with swords) and some imagery(giant bats, etc.) might be a little too much for anyone under 13. If you know your Bible stories, you will EASILY recognize the influence. It is sword & sorcery fantasy for people who are hesitant about those categories due to the occult influence.\n",
      "This film is a marvelous rendition of C. S. Lewis's classic tale, made for a family friendly audience, not taking away from the Christian allegory in the tale, but not overly emphasizing it either. The young actors playing the children called upon to save the magical land of Narnia are first rate, especially the one playing Edmund who is able to convey absolute shame and despair with an expression. Liam Neeson conveys a tender majesty as the lion king Aslan, though he sounded a lot like Sean Connery to this reviewers ears. Tilda Swindon was icily evil as the Witch Queen.The CGI that rendered talking animals, mythical creatures, and the final epic battle was well done, not looking fake at all, indeed looking more advanced that even the eye popping effects of The Lord of the Rings. Heres hoping that a franchise has been born and the rest of the books are made as well.\n",
      "I'm a classroom teacher and we had just finished reading this book in class. I've said the book is always better than the movie. But this movie surpasses C.S. Lewis superb classic, in my opinion. When my students watched the movie, they went through the whole gamat of emotions, and erupted in cheers when the battle was won! The movie was very well done. I was pleased.\n",
      "I received this quicker than promised and it was brand new in manufacturing wrap just as promised. Great product, great service, great movie.\n",
      "I was in a play version of The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe (I played Mr. Tumnus and had the only SOLO song called YOU CAN'T IMAGINE)... and I have to say this movie... goes right along with that play and the book. It was breath-takingly beautiful. Just as I imagined it would be. I was in awe of how life-like the animals were. Not some crappy CGI like in (forgive me) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets where that spider and the phoenix looked FAKE as all get out. NO!!! Narnia delivered REAL looking animals THAT TALK!!!! The White Witch (Jadis) was superb.... the children... EXCELLENT actors... and Aslan... I cried when the stone table scene took place but found myself cheering when the climax happened. I knew what would happen. And YES, I am 28 years old. But this just goes to show you, Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe is not just for kids... IT'S FOR EVERYONE!!!! And please... don't listen to the gossip. It isn't preachy. Sure you can find some Christian references in their if you really look for it... but if you don't, you just have a good heart warming story to enjoy.SO ENJOY IT!!!!\n",
      "This movie and the others I purchased have been out for years, yet I was never interested in watching them. Don't ask me why because I won't be able to give you an answer. One night I decided to watch this first one. I said to myself, \"I'll give it 10 minutes\". I ended up watching all 3 movies that night. There's mixed reviews on this movie, some people loved them, some liked them, some just liked 1 and hated the others, I for one enjoyed every one equally. Aslan was definitely my favorite in all 3 movies. Just like the Harry Potter movies, I have watched these numerous times already. Definitely worth your time and money.\n",
      "I have seen this movie twice and enjoyed it more the second time. You have to watch this movie through the eyes of a child.DO NOT go into it thinking \"Lord of The Rings\" or \"Harry Potter\", even though it is fantasy it is a totally different feel. It is a very close adaptation to the book only adding a few things that I believe helps the character devolopment for the children more than the book did. The CGI is great in most of the movie, other parts seem a little rushed through with the CG effects, but I really did not notice all that much because I felt like I was visiting an old friend. If you loved the books I am almost positive you will love the movie. If you did not like the books you will not like the movie. The allegory is intact, and I love it! These Messiah figures are in countless other movies like Matrix, E.T., Star Wars etc. but I do not see anyone winning about those. Aslan works for me, The White Witch and MR. Tumnus (are those His real legs? Amazing CGI on this guy!) is amazing. Lucy is a great actor so is The Professor.The other kid actors are so-so but Edmunds pretty good.Just remember to watch it with a childs eyes and know there is no blood. This movie has its own feel you either like it or you don't. I am a big fan of the books and I loved it.\n",
      "No one does a fairy tale better than Disney. When C.S. Lewis wrote these books he was purposefully copying the fairytales he loved. Disney has done justice to the work.The CGI of Aslan is wonderful. His expressions are quite cat-like, while remaining regal. The other creatures are also awe-inspiring.\n",
      "I have seen this movie before  but was never able to find it.  So finally.  Thank you very much.  for having it\n",
      "The best of the best of children's stories...based on a book by the incomparable CS Lewis, it offers everything to inspire both children and adults.\n",
      "We saw this movie in the theater and it was beautifully shot film.  The scenery was beautiful and the special effects are superb.The story line is not a complete following of the book.  The changes are minor unless you are devout follower of the books.  Then the changes will annoy.I think they did a great job casting for the film.  The children did a great job.  Surprising is the adult actors which play the children grown up.  They looked like the children.Aslan was well done and Liam did a great job voicing him.I have heard this film labeled Lord of the Rings for children.  Probably a good description.  However, I would be careful with taking any children to this movie.The battle scenes can get intense.  However, you don't have overt blood splattering or limbs getting hacked off.  You do see creatures getting cut down and turned into stone.If your child is noise sensitive, the howl of Minotaur and Aslan might bother them.Aslan does die but is resurrected.Some people might be concerned about the Religious undertones.  CS was a very religious man and those that know the Religion can spot the meanings.  However, they are not enough to detract (if that description can be used) from the story.  When I read the books as a kid, I didn't pick up on them.There are extras on the DVD.  There are Bloopers which are ok.  There are commentaries that you can enable which do the popup info during the move.  Someday I might run through it.Overall it was a good film and it was enough to interest my wife to read the stories.\n",
      "Now, while I could write a long and in-depth review of \"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe,\" I'm not going to. Most of what can be said about the story and the movie itself has been said already by other reviewers, so I'll try keep this short.The Narnia Chronicles have long been some of my favorite novels, and when I first heard that there was going to be a big-screen adaptation of the first story in the series, I was thrilled. Now that I've seen it, I'm even more thrilled. The movie-makers have done a very good job of adapting the novel to the screen, creating a film that is almost point-by-point faithful to the book. The acting in the film is superb, in some cases electrifying, and the chosen actors are good matches to their roles. I didn't notice the rushed feeling or inconsistent quality that some of the other reviewers mentioned. I think that the whole film is consistently very well done, and it definitely fulfilled my expectations. The Christian parts of the film were handled tastefully, neither heavier nor lighter than what is in the book. If I hadn't know the allegory was there, I wouldn't have recognized it as being allegory. It was just part of the plotline.The bottom line is that this is an enjoyable movie of high quality in all respects that I could see. It's great to see on the cinema screen, and it'll make a nice addition to my DVD collection later.\n",
      "My kids love this show and love watching it.  This is definitely the strongest production of the 3.  I really enjoy this show.\n",
      "A really good movie. it is my favorite movie of the Chronicles of Narnia I really recommend this amazing movie.\n",
      "This movie is the best so far at representing C.S. Lewis' children's classic, \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.\" The child actors are good representations of the characters of Peter, Susan, Edward, and Lucy (with the caveat that Peter is perhaps a tad too glamorous), and the CG representations of the talking animals are terrific as are the fantastic and mythological creatures, both good and evil.  Aslan himself is a marvel, and wonderfully finessed CG together with Liam Neeson's marvellous voice bring him to life.  How Hollywood does with the subsequent movies (in whichever order they choose to portray them...prequel, and the rest...or otherwise) will depend on its faithfulness to the originals. But if they choose to loyally portray C.S. Lewis' books, I think they'll find the audience not only appreciative, but also as devoted as the fans of the Harry Potter novels currently are.\n",
      "Since I'm such a huge C. S. Lewis fan, I'm a little ashamed that I waited over a month out from Narnia's release date to see it. Why did I do that? There are numerous reasons. One is that I have a new baby, so it's a bit hard to get out of the house, but that didn't stop me and my wife from making it out to the theater for the first week of King Kong's release. No, I think the real reason is because I was afraid that Narnia would be mediocre, and much of what I had heard from the Christian community backed that up, despite strong reviews from critics. The criticisms were numerous, but I'll list a few:The movie is only \"Lord of the Rings Junior.\"It underrepresents or underexplains the character of Aslan.It waters down the book's religious allegory.The children are bad actors.The movie is a cheap attempt at cashing in on the success of The Passion of the Christ, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter by throwing all those films into a blender.And ad infinitum ...When my wife and I sat down in the theater on Sunday night, I was expecting no more than a mediocre film that reflected all of these criticisms or worse, another cheap translation of a classic work of literature, a rushed hack-job of a movie that exists for the sole reason of making money.I was way wrong. From the opening scene of the bombing of London to the final, \"Try me,\" from the professor, I was entranced. And \"entranced\" is not a word I use lightly. For a grown man who is a bit jaded at the current vapid Hollywood culture to be so mesmerized by a kids' movie with fauns, talking beavers, and Santa Claus is, to me, an astonishing thing.No one, least of all me, expected Narnia to be such a work of unusual dramatic power. I know there are many others who didn't see it that way, but considering the box office numbers, I think this movie resonated with many people. In fact, not only are Narnia's box office numbers good, it looks like it is actually going to beat King Kong as the holiday box office champ. No one saw that coming. Neither did anyone expect it to be third most profitable movie of the year, behind only the behemoths of Star Wars and Harry Potter, the latter of which may still be surpassed.My wife had the same reaction as I did. She even went so far as to say that the scene of Aslan's death is more powerful than the crucifixion of Jesus scene in The Passion of the Christ. I am tempted to agree. There is a moment when we see Aslan, alone, shoulders slumped as he walks to his doom under the moonlit trees. Something about this scene poignantly portrays the eternal loneliness that Christ must have felt as he pondered what it must be like to be abandoned by God the Father on the cross. When he asks the Pevensie girls to hold on to his mane as he walks because he \"could use the company,\" I was almost - pardon the cliche - moved to tears.I suppose that many of the criticisms came from the same sort of literary purists that went into a hysteria over every instance in the Lord of the Rings movies that weren't exactly the same as in the books. But this sort of thinking comes from a misunderstanding of the difficulty of translating from the literary medium to the film medium. Like any task of translation, it may be necessary to depart from a strict reading of the original material in order to keep the spirit of the material in the new medium.For example, take one of the primary criticisms from a recent review of the movie at The Decent Films Guide. The author, Steven Greydanus, seems to understand the difficulty in making the translation, and then second guesses the filmmakers on one minor change after another. For example, he takes issue with the fact that the film version of Peter is more of a reluctant hero than the book version:Take the depiction of Peter Pevensie, the eldest sibling, whom Lewis depicts as a natural leader who intuitively grasps the obligations the siblings have to Tumnus and to Narnia. In the film, Peter becomes a reluctant participant who is always trying to back out of Narnian affairs and get his siblings safely back to England. It's the Aragorn Complex; the only good leader, Hollywood is sure, is a reluctant leader.He goes on to say that this change, \"makes no sense, dramatically or thematically.\" Well, why not? By making Peter a more reluctant hero, the screenwriter actually incorporated one of those bedrocks of good drama - internal conflict - into the characterization of Peter. This sort of change only helps to enhance the story in its translation into a two and a half hour movie. I wouldn't be so hard on Mr. Greydanus if this was his only gripe, but he goes on to produce a copious list of complaints about less-than-literal departures from the original text.This makes no sense to me. To be fair, some of the criticisms listed above do have some merit. I would liked to have heard some reference to Aslan's Father, the Emperor Across the Sea, and to the fact that it was He who wrote the laws of deep magic. Neither is there any reference to the \"deeper magic\" that overturns the deep magic, but Aslan does explain it in a way, although he doesn't use the term \"deeper magic.\" But these beefs are fleas of insignifance on the back of a majestic lion. I would just as soon complain that someone freely gave me a million dollars in a paper sack when I preferred plastic. It's also true that Narnia is no Lord of the Rings. But Fruity Pebbles are also a very different animal than Peanut Butter Crunch, but I love them both. It looks like Prince Caspian is up next, so all those who appreciated this entry into the series only have good things to look forward to.\n",
      "My family wanted to watch a family movie and since one of my sons is picking up phrases from the movie, I asked them if they wanted to see it.We saw it and we loved it! It is a very good family movie that has a great message!\n",
      "This movie isn't exactly like the book, nor should one expect it to be. On its own, it really is a good movie, and I liked James McAvoy and Cate Blanchett in their roles as Tumnus and the White Queen respectively. Great special effects as well, so overall it's a good movie and if you liked the book, you should enjoy this as well.\n",
      "This is a great movie. The acting is very good by all of the children, and the adults. The beavers and all of the Narnian creatures were brought to life in amazing and imaginative ways as well. The witch was nothing like I expected her to be, but nevertheless she did a great job.If you love Lewis' books as much as I do, and enjoy an excellent fantasy film, see this, and be taken away to Narnia.\n",
      "I loved the books when I was young, and still read them to this very day, despite being an early 20-something now. Before I could read, my Dad read them to me, putting on silly voices, before I got fed up and learned to read, so I could make up my own voices as I went along. They were one of the first books I seriously got into, long before the Harry Potters of today. This is an instant classic. I never really understood it as a child, as I've grown older I've perhaps understood little bits here & there, but everytime I read the books now, I discover something new. Like today, I discovered I'd been reading them the 'wrong' way the whole time. I've got them in one big book, and it runs The Magician's Nephew, The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe, The Horse & His Boy (the worst in my opinion) Prince Caspian, The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader The Silver Chair & The Last Battle. I always knew The Magician's Nephew was a prequel, but I've always read it first. But I didn't know The Horse & His Boy was a prequel too! The running order (as they were originally published back in the good old days) should go: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, The Horse and His Boy, The Magician's Nephew & The Last Battle.I was actually nervous about watching this film beforehand. I never got to see it at the cinema - due to it being released before Christmas and I work in a card shop - so I had to wait til it was released on DVD, and then had to wait longer as it was a birthday present. And then when I'd worked myself up about watching it, I fell asleep half an hour into it. (But through tiredness, not due it being boring.)Why was I was nervous about watching it? In the late 80s, The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe, Prince Caspian & The Voyage of The Dawn Treader & The Silver Chair were was actually filmed in the UK for children's TV. It was released on DVD a while ago, and it was really, REALLY bad. The young actors were nothing how I imagined them to look, the actress playing Lucy had the most awful teeth, the special effects were shockingly bad - but probably terrific for that time - and to this day, I've still never watched it all. And probably never will.Back to the review.I couldn't stay up long enough to watch all of it in one go, so carried on the following night, and found myself getting completely sucked in. It just totally came to life in my eyes, and everything was the way I remembered it. Sure, there were a couple of extra little scenes added in here & there, but only a dedicated reader would have known most of them, and they added to the film, rather than detracted. I was disappointed that some of Mr & Mrs Beaver's best lines were taken out, and Liam Neeson being the voice of Aslan just didn't work for me.The actors of Peter, Susan, Edmund & Lucy were terrific too, although I never liked Susan's character in the books, and found myself hating her in this. Thankfully, Susan & Peter never really feature that much in the books, they grow up, and get too \"old\" to believe in Narnia, so the younger ones feature much more. I wasn't keen on Tilda Swinton as The White Witch. She was very tall wasn't she? The image on screen just didn't match the image in my head. I felt myself completely sucked into the world of Narnia, and although there some slight quibbles from my Dad (having seen it) about how some things were similar to The Lord Of The Rings, and I did want to shout out \"Freedom!\" during the big battle scene, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Totally unexpected.Will I be watching this again? Most definitely. I was almost in tears, it matched what was in my head nearly perfectly. I just hope it continues throughout the rest of the films (as all books have been optioned), and doesn't go bad in some, like the Harry Potters. I don't think I can wait until 2007 for Prince Caspian. I'll definitely go to the cinema for the rest of them!!!Keep watching after the credits for a 30 second clip, featuring a little bit more of Jim Broadbent as the Professor.\n",
      "Brilliant adaptation. This movie brought me back to my childhood when I loved reading the books. It tempts me to go back and read them again. The visuals were gorgeous, the film was moving. It made me want to cry with happiness.\n",
      "Great for families. My daughter loved to follow the books by watching the movies. Good fun, true to the story!\n",
      "referred to as either the next LOTR or a mini LOTR for kids still dosen't change the fact that the crhonicles of narnia, the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe is great. perfectly keeping touch with the book and adding its own magic, this film definetly marks the begining of a beautiful franchise. the movie centers around the pevinseve children who, during WWII, are sent to the country side to live with a mystirous professor. here, the youngest stumbles apon the land of narnia through a wardrobe. here, the siblings venture and learn of a mystirous prophcecy that tells four humans will save narnia from the evil rule of the white witch. the film then glides along, bringing magic, wonder, and even a battle scene for those who like LOTR. the two standout rolls definently go to henley and swinton. georgie definently stands out as the youngest pevenseve bring natural curiosity and charm to the screen. swinton perfectly embodies the white witch with here piercing eyes and manipulative personality. in the novel, the witch is merelly precived as your simple bad guy but swinton simply nazified the role, makeing her into a cold, calculating, resourceful villian. other great roles go to popplewall, mosley, keynes, and even liam neason playing aslon. so see the next big thing.\n",
      "Fun movie for the kids. Good quality.  I watched on my ipad.  Can't wait to watch the next two movies.\n",
      "This is the story that sparks the imagination of a child, or even an adult. Many criticize it for it's Christian allegory, but many praise it for being an amazing story.The story revolves around four siblings: Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan. They moved to the country from London during the air raids of World War II. So, they go to Professor Kirke's estate, which has many artifacts and many unexplored rooms. One day while it's raining, the children play hide-and-seek and little Lucy(the youngest) hides in a wardrobe. Fortunately, she loves the feel and smell of fur, so she keeps going back, expecting to hit the backboard. Instead, she stumbles upon Narnia, a magical place that has been under the curse of the White Witch(Jadis) for over a century. Lucy meets many magical characters, including fauns, cenataurs, the great lion, Aslan, and even Father Christmas! But, there's a problem. When she goes back through War Drobe, her siblings don't believe that the place exists at all!It's up to her to convince them otherwise, to save Narnia from the White Witch's grasp, and to get Edmund to stop being a bully.Many might ask if this is good for a small child to watch. I'd say yes, because it is an emotional, but touching movie. There are a few graphic scenes: When the White Witch kills Aslan on the stone table(but he DOES come back later, so it's not completely depressing for children), a battle of good and evil, etc. etc.My Bible teacher actually had encouraged me to read the book before I saw the movie on December 9. I finished the book at approximately 2pm and was in the theaters by 6:30, watching it on the big screen. As soon as the movie ended, I walked next door to Borders, picked up a copy of all 7 books, and had finished by the next week. I've seen the movie 4 times in theaters.I doubt that I've ever seen a movie as accurate and loyal to the book as this one. There are a few minor switches, and some more drama tweaked into the plot. Director [Andrew] Adamson did an amazing job. I highly recommend reading the book before seeing it, because you have a better idea of the characters, what Edmund is going through(which I probably wouldn't have understood if I hadn't read the book), and you will be able to have a better connection to the book.I also suggest reading the Magician's Nephew, which is actually about Professor [Digory] Kirke(yes, the man who has the children at his estate)'s childhood, and how he, his best friend Polly, and The White Witch Jadis were present when Aslan sang Narnia into existence. It also explains how the wardrobe came into being and why it has magical properties. This book, however, was written after The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe.It was recently confirmed that they are in fact making Prince Caspian, another book in the series. I hope that if you enjoyed this movie as much as I did, that you will, in fact, go see the second \"installment\". :)\n",
      "received item in good condition. It's a present for my daughter so she hasn't actually gotten it yet. I am sure it will be fine. If it isn't I will be returning it.\n",
      "Aside from my experience that I expressed in the title of this review, I found that this movie had incredible ability to provoke deep thought and meaning. It really touched me on a deeper level and definitely made me see the correlation between this and the Bible.I never read the books. In fact, I was never sure how I felt about this series. However, when I saw this movie, I loved it and we bought it when it came out. If I ever have the time, I would consider reading the books as well.**UPDATE** 1/19/08 I have since read the whole Chronicles of Narnia book series and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! The books are even better and I read all of them within two weeks!! They are so powerful and C.S. Lewis has such a way of painting the picture and taking you on a journey as if you are really there! I almost felt like I was living in Narnia!! LOLAnyways, the movie followed the book fairly well. Of course, there were a few things that were added or taken out - but it was still pretty accurate. I can't wait to see \"Prince Caspian\" this year!!I also recommend getting the extended edition of this movie with the added scenes. ;)\n",
      "I can't believe I waited so long to see this movie! \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" is everything I hoped it would be. As a huge fan of the C.S. Lewis novel, I didn't expect the film adaptation to live up to the book, but I was very pleasantly surprised! The movie nailed everything perfectly.This film tells the story of Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy. The four siblings are sent away to the home of a quirky professor during World War II. The professor's house is huge and the children spend a lot of time exploring. One day the youngest child, Lucy, stumbles across a peculiar wardrobe. Behind the mothballs and fur coats is an entrance to the magical world of Narnia, which is under the control of the evil White Witch. Lucy and her siblings encounter many colorful characters in Narnia and join with them to defeat the witch and bring freedom to the residents of Narnia.Obviously, since this is a film adaptation of a novel, a few things from the book had to be cut. The original novel is so fabulous and it's a shame that every word couldn't have been included in the movie, but that would have been virtually impossible to do. Overall, I thought the screenplay was wonderful and the film stayed very true to the book. Everything that was depicted on screen looked exactly the way I imagined it would when I read the novel. The cast is perfect...all four children are so cute! (I must admit, I was not thrilled with Georgie Henley [the actress who played Lucy] at first, but she grew on me pretty quickly...and Tilda Swinton was PERFECT as the White Witch...so creepy!) The special effects were also incredible. All of the Narnia creatures looked amazing, especially Aslan (and whoever decided to get Liam Neeson to do Aslan's voice deserves a gold star for the day).I absolutely LOVED this movie! Watching it brought back many fond memories of reading \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" as a child...I'm so glad that the book is being reintroduced to a new generation of children in such a wonderful way. I hope more of the Narnia books make their way to the big screen very soon!\n",
      "This is an excellent movie.  Excellent.  I can really see that this will be a great franchise.This movie does have a few added elements that were not in the book (as far as I remember).  However, they did not detract from the overall feel of the story.This movie may be a bit much for small children.  It really pushes the PG barrier.  There is no swearing, no sex.  However there is a tremendous violent battle (which was awesome to see), and a major character is killed.  The witch can be a little frightening, as well as some of her minions who were quite grotesque.The special effects are amazing and seamless.  Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) is stunning.  So are the varieties of animals that populate this gorgeous world.  The music is beautiful.Stick around for the credits.  They cut away almost right after they begin for a quick conversation that is helpful to know for the next movie.Lastly, if you can, view this movie in a DLP theater.  Lucas gave each state a single DLP projector for the release of Star Wars 3, and the theater near my home town happens to have the one for this state.  The technology really is worth seeing, especially in this case.  Everything is crystal clear, almost 3-d in some shots.  There are no \"hairs\" or imperfections in the film.\n",
      "\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,\" is by far the best of the master storyteller, C. S. Lewis's children's books. \"The Silver Chair\" comes in second in my ranking. I was very excited to learn that a live action movie of this allegorical and entertaining classic was being released, but was frankly disappointed to learn that Disney had a hand in producing this film. Their production of \"A Wrinkle In Time\" was atrocious! However, it just goes to show that we can't always judge from past experiences. This movie stays extremely true to Lewis's novel, and even embellishes some places that add a deeper richness to the plot. For instance, the movie deals largely with the dilemma of the four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, who must be evacuated from London to the English countryside because of the German air raids. Though Lewis briefly mentions this in his novel, the film touches on the heartbreaking element of being separated from family, and suggests that this is why Edmund acts spitefully at times. The intricate plot moves from the actual historical World War II into Narnia, where the four children must engage in a battle of their own.I was extremely impressed that the symbolism was still so beautifully conveyed. Tilda Swinton as Jadis the White Witch, and Liam Neeson as Aslan both convey evil and good forces, especially Neeson, who conveys The Great Lion's authority and sacrificial love in a masterful way. Skandar Keynes is superb as Edmund, the spiteful but lonely boy who succumbs to Jadis's wiles when she feeds him Turkish Delight, (Temptation.) Georgie Henley is perfect as Lucy, conveying the little girl's innocence and wonder at stepping through a magic wardrobe, and the heartbreak of not being believed. James McAvoy is delightful as Mr. Tumnus the Faun who has a heart of gold and is also very funny. William Moseley is magnificent as Peter, showing his self-doubt and ultimate bravery. Anna Popplewell is excellent as Susan, a girl with doubts like her older brother, and the voice of reason. Dawn French and Ray Winstone are excellent as the Beavers, and provide lots of commic relief and valuable insight. A side mention must be made for Rupert Everet who plays a fox. Although it is a small role, he steals the sceens in which he plays. All of the supporting cast are equally excellent, and they work to bring Lewis's thrilling classic brilliantly to life.I actually went to the theater and watched the film three times, and everyone who accompanied me commented on the beauty of the scenery. I am blind myself, so I cannot comment on this aspect, but I will say that the musical score of the movie is breathtakingly beautiful. As an example, listen closely when the small, seemingly insignificant army of Aslan, led by Peter, comes out to meet the vast army of the White Witch. The music in this portion truly conveys the bravery of good coming up against insurmountable opposition and evil. I was moved to tears, as I am sure you will be. Also, please listen and see how much symbolism you can spot. Of course, if this is your first time getting acquainted with Narnia, just enjoy the rich imagery and breathtaking story, and please read the book. The director and producers worked diligently, and crafted an unforgettable masterpiece. You will cry, laugh, and never be the same again. Happy viewing, and God bless.\n",
      "The white witch is very scary. We read the book first so they new what was going on otherwise it would have been a disaster. My 5 year old was more perplexed then scared. My 7 year old got that the lion was being tortured and murdered. We talked through all of this for two days. It's a really well made movie. I think my two are on the young side for the themes in this. Read the book first!!!\n",
      "I've been looking forward to seeing this film for months. I read the books and watched study versions of the educational films as a child. It's been years but the stories have always held a special place in my heart. The children were wonderful actors; the sets were beautiful; the special effects were excellent. Everything fit together perfectly. I was completely inthralled. I'll be rushing to buy this on dvd when it is released so I can watch it again and again. It's inspired me to dig out my book so I can read the complete works.\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia is a Christian story!C.S. Lewis was a Christian and wrote the books to be that way.Aslan is Jesus Christ.  His death is the Crucifixion.His resurrection reflects Christ's resurection.Aslan sacrificed himself to save Edmund.  Jesus sacrificed Himself to save us.Alsan conquered the White Witch.  Jesus conquered evil.There are more parallels.  The movie did not live up to the book in that it did not portray these parallels significantly. This is supposed to be a salvation story.  When you read the books you can't help but realize that Aslan is God.  People who have NOT read the books and watch the movie don't get this idea at all and Narnia is just a \"cool\" movie.In short, the movie could have been much, much more profound, but I grace it with 4 stars.MFR\n",
      "Over the years, I have come to expect Disney to completely ruin classic literature, so when I saw this movie in the theater my hopes weren't high. I was very impressed. The movie is very well done and the story was handled quite well. Well enough that I was willing to search all over and finally Amazon for a widescreen version. I recommend this CS Lewis adaptation, but keep in mind it is a movie of an excellent novel and it is an adaptation.\n",
      "I went to this movie expecting to be bored by talking animals and child stuff and was surprised by the quality of this well made film that grabs you from the start.  Four children living in WW II London are sent to live in the countryside by their mother to protect them from the frequent air raids.  They end up in a mansion on a huge estate.  The mansion has one room with nothing in it but an armoir.  The children use it to hide and are accidently transported to a fantasy world with talking animals and a witch that wants them dead.  They are forced to grow up fast if they hope to survive.The special effects are great and the witch is the most memorable since Margaret Hamiliton's Wicked Witch of the West!  The big battle scene rates up with the fights in the Lord of the Rings movies.  This is the best movie I have seen in 2005!\n",
      "The \"extended version\" isn't as long as the Lord of the Rings stuff but it has a couple nice bits here and there (more of the battle, bit more of Edmund and the Witch). The second disc has lots of nice documentaries and behind the scenes stuff. The third disc provides an excellent look at CS Lewis' life and how he created the entire Narnia saga. The fourth disc is the best as it takes the \"audio commentary\" a step further by showing the theatrical cut of the film alongside clips of the shooting of the film, effects work, wardrobe, comments and more. It's an amazing experience that enhances the movie wonderfully. Even if you have the 2-disc version, the fourth disc on this set makes it a must-have.\n",
      "Of epic proportion and sumptuously filmed, this first entry in the CS Lewis Chronicles of Narnia is a cinematic delight.Transported the world of Narnia where animals talk and witches fly, four youngsters find themselves embroiled in a battle to save the people of Narnia from the very wicked White Witch.The costumes, music, lighting, special effects, and direction are all superb, and the cast is a revelation.  The four children are well played by Georgie Henley (the cutest little tyke since Drew Barrymore in ET); Skandor Keynes as the dark and brooding Edmond; William Moseley (looking like a cross between Richard Thomas and a young Heath Ledger) is the gallant older brother destined to be king; Anna Popplewell is the reserved, upstanding older sister; Tilda Swinton is awesome as the witch, conveying a chilling evil not recently seen; and James McEvoy is delightful as the faun, Mr. Thommus.  Under Andrew Adamson's (SHREK) sure direction, the movie is a marvelous fantasy indeed.  Even though it is somewhat violent, there is no lingering gore, so kids should be allright with it.\n",
      "As a lifelong fan of fantasy/sci-fi I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. It was fun seeing a fantasy world like Narnia brought to life so realistically on screen (assuming the obviously fake snow and cold don't count!).I haven't read the Narnia books so I don't know if the movie was faithful to them or not, but I thought what they brought to the screen was pretty good and very entertaining. I had read comments about the movie shortly after its release about it having a religious agenda, and while there were some religious allegories in the movie, I personally didn't see that agenda. Yes, there was one scene involving the Lion and the Witch in particular, but that was about all I noticed and to be truthful, it didn't bother me.I have two complaints about the movie: I would have liked a little back story and there was a little too much with the talking animals in the movie. I like talking animals alright, but too much is still too much and after 2+ hours it was starting to get to be too much.A fun movie, good special effects (and I'm not generally a fan of movies filmed almost completely in front of a green screen), but not a lot of Narnia history, back story or substance. I enjoyed the movie, but it won't be taking the place of The Wizard of Oz, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings or the old animated movie Wizards on my list anytime soon.\n",
      "It was great to see this story told with great effects and on the big screen. As far as the hand-wringing over whether it is...HORROR...a Christian allegory. So what if it is? Would the left wing be wetting its pants if it was a Muslim allegory? You bet they wouldn't. Bigots AND hypocrites. Ignore them and see this film. You will enjoy it on whatever level you want to.\n",
      "Enjoyed this movie with our grandson, good messages for our lives.  He enjoyed the fast moving action, that kept his attention.\n",
      "I think I may have read The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe at some point, but it's all fuzzy.  Mostly, I remember the effeminate lion, known as Aslan, from the animated version.  This left an impression on viewers for sure, because it showed up in a South Park episode (apparently, all lions do is tell really dumb jokes). This movie will make you forget the animated version of the C.S. Lewis' novel.To wit, the children of the Pevensie family are sent away to live with foster parents during World War II. There's brave Peter (William Moseley), angry Edmund (Shandar), smart Susan (Anna Popplewell) and innocent Lucy (Georgie Henley).  The four are eventually transported to Narnia, a land populated by fauns, centaurs, werewolves, minotaurs, ogres, giants, harpies, phoenixes, griffons, goblins, and talking animals.  It is here that the Christ-like lion known as Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) has returned to do battle with the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).The four children are each gifted with special weapons by none other than Santa Claus--err, sorry, Father Christmas (James Cosmo)--and ultimately must face their own fears and share their unique talents to save Narnia.The film starts out slow, slow enough to make the children in the audience restless.  But once the war begins, it's a heart-pounding race to the finish.  Never before have so many mythological beings blasted across the screen, Dungeons & Dragons style, to beat the stuffing out of each other. The special effects are so good that when Aslan isn't speaking you forget he's an animated lion.  And amazingly, this is a PG (not even PG-13!) movie.People get hurt and even die.  Big, scary monsters try to murder each other as well as the children.  And they use words like \"kill.\"  This is not the kiddy fare you remember.And yet, not one child was upset.  Narnia harkens back to a time when fairytales were cautionary stories that demonstrated the right choices through the travails of its protagonists.  All four children grow: Peter finds his courage, Edmund his humility, Susan her sense of wonder, and Lucy...well, Lucy discovers loss.The Christian symbolism is rife but appropriate.  Ironically, Narnia may well convert those holdouts that feel fantasy is somehow evil, as opposed to its original roots--allegories for Christian morality.  It completes the work that Peter Jackson started, a sort of Lord of the Rings for the kiddie set.  I for one am glad that C.S. Lewis' vision was realized with such breathtaking imagination.All that, and there's not a trace of a lisping lion.\n",
      "I went to see this movie today with my youth group at my church and I was overwhelmed with how powerful this movie really is! As soon as this is released on DVD, I am buying it! I hope my review has helped you!!! God Bless!\n",
      "The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe is a quality movie that is a worthy addition to the fantasy genre. The key to enjoying this film,though,is to NOT compare it to other fantasy films. No,it's not as good as Harry Potter or even Lord of the Rings. But in and of itself is highly satisfying film. Don't compare it to other movies. Enjoy it for what it is. With a few changes,this movie is pretty faithful to the book. Now,from a visual point of view,this movie gets the job done. The wardrobe itself is fantastic and the snowy Narnia Lucy enters as well as the battlefield at the end are well captured. The animals,especailly the beavers and Aslan look pretty realistic.  The storyline flows along pretty nicely. It is somewhat slow at the start,but never to point of dragging and once they are in Narnia the story flows on wonderfully.  And I liked Georgie's performance a lot. She NAILED Lucy. The Journey into Narnia,the epic battle,and the coronation follow the book pretty well. 1 change I didn't like was when they edited out the \"Deeper Magic From Before the Dawn Of Time.\" and replaced it with a \"different interpretation \" of the \"Deep Magic.\" This makes it sound as though the \"Deep Magic.\" played a role in the rise of Aslan,when in the book,it was clearly the \"Deeper Magic.\" that allowed him to rise. That's the 1 change I felt was untrue to the spirit of the book. On the other hand I liked the way the started the movie. In the book there's just a small line saying the children had been sent away during the war. I like the way they made the filmmakers actually SHOWED this as opposed to just telling it. By actually showing this scene,the filmmakers captured the emotional state of the children in a way the book didn't. You really understand by the time the children are at Professor Kirke's house that they are not on vacation,but are really going through some very tough times. All in all,the journey of the characters (Edmund,peter,Susan,Lucy,Aslan,Etc.) is well captured by the film.  All in all,the Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe is pretty faithful to the book and is a quality movie.\n",
      "A group of us took our Church School class to view this film.  We had just finished an Advent study using the book.  The kids were absolutely fascinated as were the  adults.  We had viewed a video from BBC and this film surpassed by far the video.  I highly recommend this film for family viewing. After seeing other reviews that totally panned this film, I wonder where if they have a sense of fantasy.  I did not read the series until I was an adult and could not put them down until finished.  I don't know what others were looking for, but I wanted to visualize what I had read.  This film did just that and more.  I came away from the film comparing it with \"The Passion of The Christ.\"  Check the parallels and see if you don't feel the same.  Not as much violence, but the story string is there if you look for it. I went to be entertained, not to challenge the acting and technology.  I was entertained to the utmost.  Give this movie a chance to challenge your theology.Look beyond the flaws (and every movie based on literature is flawed) and feel what Lewis is saying to all of us in a world of tumult and turmoil. Great Britain had just come thru horrendous times and was on its knees when Lewis wrote this story.  I believe he was attempting to show that no matter how bad things are there is always somthing better just around the corner, across the street or, even, tomorow.  You only have to have faith that all is not as bad as it seems.\n",
      "The \"Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion, the witch, and the wardrobe(CON),\" represents a great depiction of Christ and represents Christianity in a lot of ways, but through that we saw much more than a dream world, we saw the depiction of Christ at work through the storyline, and Aslan as the King and Savior. This movie has a lot of positives and not to many negatives in it. Even though it might seem that this movie looks to grab the attention of younger people, the overall themes look toward Christ and have many people seeing it as a life-changing. Were going to look at the positives in Narnia and how Christianity is themed throughout the whole movie.Throughout the \"CON\" we see how the importance of life is key to wining the race. Lucy, Edmond, Peter and Susan find themselves lost in a Wardrobe and walk into a fairytale land that they have never seen before. The kids think the world of Narnia is great but they soon find out there is evil in this land also. The fight between good and evil cause almost be depicted as the forces of \"Heaven\" and \"Hell.\" Aslan is the leader of the good people of Narnia and the White Witch is the self proclaimed queen of Narnia. Here the movie sheds light on the basis of Christianity and how Christians have to face the death and destruction of the world. With Edmond's life on the line, Aslan had to sacrifice his life for him. At the night of the sacrifice it is almost like the day that Christ was crucified. All of the similarities are seen throughout that night even to the point of death and resurrection. The storyline itself gives way to so many parallels to Christianity.The character of Aslan can be perceived as much more that a King. Aslan is a lion who can be seen as the king over everyone. All the animals looked up to Aslan as Lord over Narnia and is definitely the depiction of Christ. Without the leadership from Aslan, the land of Narnia would surely fall to the hands of the White Witch. Alsan's character is so important because he was there in Narnia to preserve the good in that world. In the same way Christ was put on Earth for a purpose to seek and to save what was lost. Also in the \"CON\" it does a good job of giving Aslan a Character that is very personal and caring to each individual he see's. Christ is also the same way and it gives a very positive outlook on Christianity and how Jesus is also there for everyone's needs.Finally is the way Aslan is seen as the savior in the movie. When Edmond s life on the line, Aslan gladly stepped in front and was willing to put his life on the line for him. With Christianity, its the same thing that Christ did for us on the Cross. He saved us from the sins of the world and helped to give us a way to eternal life by getting to know him. Also after Aslan was killed, a couple days later he resurrected in front of the eyes of Lucy and Susan. The same way, Christ also resurrected and too a girl saw the Lord a couple days after his resurrection (Mary Magdelene). With the war scene too, Aslan comes back to save his fellow friends, and in the same way Christ is going to come back to save us from the sins of the world.As seen throughout the movie the \"CON\" there are a lot of parallels to Christianity. The characters in the movie help to bring alive the real life connections for us today. Christ can be seen as a leader the same way that Aslan is for the land of Narnia. Also Aslan was the ultimate sacrifice for Narnia but in the same way, Christ paid a much bigger price. In movies we try to compare things to Christ and what he did, but what he did on the cross is so much bigger than what we can fathom. With the help of the \"CON\" movies though, maybe we can shed a little light on the reality of Christ here on Earth. Maybe in the future, people will see what it really means to become a Christian.\n",
      "The company provided me with a means to return the item.  I had ordered three DVDs in the Narnia series and one turned out to require a different system PSP.  It was my understanding that it was a DVD and when it arrived it turned out to be for PSP.  I requested a means to return it and they provided it.  I have thus returned the item for a full refund which has not yet been received.\n",
      "During World War II, the Pevensie children - Peter (Moseley), Susan (Popplewell), Edmund (Keynes), and Lucy (Henley) - are sent from London to stay with Professor Kirke (Broadbent).  One day, while playing hide and seek, Lucy hides in a wardrobe.  She soon finds it is no ordinary wardrobe as it transports her to Narnia, a magical wintery world.  She meets Mr. Rumnus (McAvoy), and finds out that it has been winter there for 100 years because of the rule of the Wite Witch (Swinton).After returning to her world, she brings her siblings back with her.  Edmund disappears, having been tricked by the White Witch, and the rest must rescue him and save Narnia in the process.On the heels of \"The Lord of the Rings\", it is no surprise that this movie has been made.  There has been a surge in the popularity of fantasy epics as of late, and \"Narnia\" is a logical coice for the film treatment.  The results are about the same as the \"Rings\" trilogy.  The acting is solid all around.  This is impressive since the film is carried by four kids with minimal acting experience.  Swinton is menacing as the evil White Witch, and probably the standout performance of the movie.  The special effects are good overall.  Aslan the lion is impressive, and looks completely real.  Some of the scenes look like they were definately filmed in front of a green screen though, and that is distracting.  The story is given a good treatment by \"Shrek\" director Andrew Adamson, but I was not blown away like I hoped to be.  The result is an entertaining and good film that falls short of greatness.\n",
      "Great escape. What to say, if you read the books in the series you will love this. Its a more current version of the Land of Oz.\n",
      "The release of two centrically Christian theological films, Mel Gibson's controversial The Passion of the Christ and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, could not have come at more crucial junctures in modern American history. The thirty-million dollar budgeted The Passion of the Christ, which then went on to gross more then three-hundred and seventy-million dollars in North America alone by the end of its run in theatres, played brilliantly off of Michael Moore's seething anti-Bush propagandist piece Fahrenheit 9/11 and by November of that year proved to be momentous in the president's reelection victory, although it was far from the true issue which garnered him the majority of the people's vote (that being his stance toward the war against terrorism). The release of the second of six books in the Chronicles of Narnia series comes at a time when American Christians, many of whom side with in some shape or another with the Republican Party, find themselves in pitched battle against the intimations of political correctness and multiculturalism in their retention of the significance and sanctity of Christmas itself. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe will likely play a less indicative role then The Passion of the Christ did toward the political environment of the country last year and yet its direct allusions to Christ and his message will almost certainly be a factor in the way Christians are motivated maintain their traditions and be less reluctant to give them up for anyone.The story for The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe remains true to both C.S. Lewis's epic vision of the whimsical world of Narnia and all those who inhabit it and the Christian undertones which encompass the plot and character developments of the entire book series. This said however, the feature film adaptation of the classic children's novel does take its fair share of creative liberties in regards to specific plot elements which, for lack of a better word, fail to translate as effectively onto the screen as Lewis may have hoped they would. Rather then tarnishing C.S. Lewis's epic, they instead enhance the emotional intensity of the plot. For example, there is a scene not presented in the book in which the White Witch's secret police (wolves) are in hot pursuit of Peter, Susan, and Lucy as they cross the thawing river. This accentuates the potency of the situation and makes for a far more engaging experience then any minimal description penned in the novel could have. Furthermore, scenes like the opening sequence of the film in which German (Nazi) planes are seen bombing the city of London, an event now referred to as The Battle of Britain, fills in the gaps of background information left absent by Lewis. And while Adamson falls short of addressing the specifics of either the Nazis who bombed Britain or the Second World War in general, he leaves just enough room to allow parents at their own discretion to discuss these events in more detail with their own children as they see fit.All four child actors in the roles of Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie do a splendid job in their respected roles. There are however some issues with their characters. Peter's transformation from a gangling British preteen into a cunning and formidable warrior and inspirational leader of Aslan's army is one point of contention. It comes off as a bit miraculous, if not a bit implausible, and may be difficult for some people to swallow. Nevertheless, this is a fantasy film after all and it can just as easily be contributed to magic.James McAvoy is positively magnificent in the role of Mr. Tumnus, the faun, or half-man/half-goat, who is the first creature in the world of Narnia to befriend the young Lucy when she initially enters the magical wardrobe. His interaction with Lucy, played adorably by newcomer Georgie Henley, is emotionally priceless and works every bit as well as one might have imagined reading the children's novel. The character himself is representative of two crucial concepts author C.S. Lewis introduces in the novel. While the faun is a creature often associated with Greek/Roman paganism, he is not necessarily an evil character. Although he does stray from the righteous path in the beginning, he quickly comes to see the error of his ways and repents. Lewis' point here is that while Christianity is preferred above all other religions, every religion strives toward the virtues of charity and compassion. So when you boil down to the basics of religion, there is a common element that every one of us can relate to. The second point Lewis makes with the introduction of Mr. Tumnus is that while Christians are susceptible to sin and may initially fall prey to it, whether it be out of fear or necessity, we still have the choice to realize we are in the wrong and make up for our mistakes as Mr. Tumnus does.Tilda Swinton is emphatically conniving as the white witch Jadis, an evil enchantress who rules the realm of Narnia with a cold iron fist, turning anyone who crosses her path into stone and stowing away the hope of all its inhabitants with continuous winter without Christmas. Jadis signifies the figurative temptation of sin and evil in the world. While on the outside she may emit a certain ambiance about her that makes her attractive and desirable, once Edward gives in to the white witch's desire to capture Peter, Susan, and Lucy, he comes to grips with her true nature which is malevolent to the core. And while some readers are quick to associate Jadis with Satan, supreme rule of Hell, most literary scholars agree that she may very well be a servant of Lucifer but not the actual Prince of Darkness himself since there is no direct correlation between her actions and those of Satan as opposed to the equivalence between Aslan and Jesus Christ. Her demise, however, is not as dramatic as it should have been and feels a bit rushed as soon as the resurrected Aslan arrives on the battle scene.Overall, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is every bit as magnificent as readers dreamed it would be and exceeds nearly every expectation, though certainly far from all of them, writer C.S. Lewis may have set down for its adaptation in the last fifty years since audiences first discovered the world of Narnia. Parents however should seek to take certain precautions with their younger children as there particular scenes in the film, specifically the sacrifice of Aslan on the Stone Table, which are emotionally profound and may be too stimulating for smaller audiences. Nevertheless, if children of a specific age demographic are able to sit through the latest Harry Potter picture with little if any difficulties at all then they should be fine toward this film. The musical score, conducted by Academy Award-winning composer Harry Gregson-Williams, famous for compositions for Shrek and Team America: World Police, is not nearly as memorable as those for The Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter franchises, lacking anything related to a reoccurring musical theme, but at the same time it reaches the right emotional depth, particularly in the Battle for Narnia, while not overshadowing the actions or dialogue onscreen. Director Andrew Adamson and, more importantly, the new leadership of the Walt Disney Corporation who have in the past been far from what one would consider a close friend to the Christian community should be commended for not downplaying the allusions to Christian theology, particularly Aslan as a mirror-image of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, in an age where political correctness has dominated modern society. There is still much debate amongst the literary community as to whether the Christian allegories in The Chronicles of Narnia series were intentional or not on the part of adult Christian convert C.S. Lewis. Regardless of the true answer, if one does indeed exist, anyone unfamiliar with the suggested theological prospects of the story will hardly notice and their perception of the film so go unchanged. Though comparisons are likely to made to The Lord of the Rings series or even the Harry Potter franchise, nonetheless the special effects of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe hold their own as dazzling and the physical environment which encompasses the characters of the film, all shot on the island of New Zealand where Peter Jackson's King Kong and the three Lord of the Rings films were also filmed, is nothing short of breathtaking. Notwithstanding allegations from the ACLU quick to label The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as a piece of unmitigated brainwashing propaganda from the religious right who seek to convert the `pagans' to Christianity, the film remains a timeless fantasy classic and an emotionally grappling motion picture event, theological allusions or not.\n",
      "Is there anything more exciting for a bored child than to discover a portal that opens into a magical world of fairies and fauns, where a majestic lion battles a bad witch? That's the premise of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Walt Disney Picture's version of the first book in Lewis' seven-volume, allusion-rich, and allegorical exploration of Christian theology.During the London Blitz, four English children (The Pevensie children, ages 12 to 17) are evacuated to the country, into the care of an eccentric old professor. Soon, the children stumble upon a wardrobe in an unused room. Like Alice in Wonderland, the wardrobe is the portal to another world. Once they cross the threshold, they go into a magical world.As the Pevensie kids enter Narnia, they have to face some unexpected truths. Jadis the bad-tempered, cold-hearted evil White Queen (Tilda Swinton), holds all of Narnia in her frozen grip. Their sudden, but expected arrival triggers a call to war. And the lion king messiah Aslan returns to lead the way. Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keenness), older brother Peter (William Moseley), sister Susan (Anna Popplewell), and, the youngest, Lucy (Georgie Henley), will have to face great challenges as they fight alongside Aslan to return Narnia to the glorious kingdom it used to be.As fantasy films go, Narnia tells a relatively easy-to-follow story, clearly designed for a younger audience than The Lord of the Rings. The typical core family values theme of the Disney movies mixes its brand of Christian family values with popular English sentiment.Despite comparisons to The Lord of the Rings, Narnia has more in common with both The Wizard of Oz and Peter Pan, since all three stories involve children who escape day-to-day pessimism to experience wild adventures.High-tech special effects enable the filmmakers to breath life into exotic and beautiful creatures of myth and fantasy. Fauns with the legs of goats, half-human and half-horse centaurs, and a magnificent lion that talks and leads an army of gnomes, fairies, beavers, hawks, and foxes are some of the visual marvels this movie offers us.Director Andrew Adamson (Shrek) makes an impressive live-action debut, getting engrossing performances from his young cast and grafting a nice world of special effects, giving The Chronicles of Narnia an impressive start as another family classic of myth and fable on the big screen.\n",
      "\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" was adapted from the first book in C.S. Lewis' \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" children's fantasy series, which has found popularity with readers of all ages since its publication in 1950. I found the book too simplistic as a child, but the movie is more effective. Visual effects have finally achieved enough sophistication to allow a live action film adaptation. Real people and real animals lend the story a credibility and power that previous animated versions lacked. Director Andrew Adamson has created a film that truly is entertaining for all ages, even where the book came up short. It might be dangerous to say so in some circles, but this film is superior to the book  -with vastly improved dialogue, 3-dimensional character writing, better pacing, and production design that surpasses C. S. Lewis' imagination.During World War II, the Pevensie children -teenaged Peter (William Moseley) and Susan (Anna Popplewell), younger Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and youngest Lucy (Georgie Henley)- are sent from London to the relative safety of an old Professor's (Jim Broadbent) county home. While playing hide-and-seek one day, Lucy tries hiding in a large wardrobe which, to her astonishment, leads to a wonderful wintry world called Narnia. No one believes Lucy, of course, until her brothers and sister also squeeze into the wardrobe and are transported to Narnia, where they find that they are expected to defeat the tyrannical White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and restore peace to the land in accordance with the prophecy: \"When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone sits at Cair Paravel in throne, the evil time will be over and done.\"A fantastic cast leads the audience through Narnia: The young actors who play the children are all spot-on in their roles, but special credit may be due the youngest of the cast, Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes. Georgie Henley is a real scene-stealer, and she personifies a child's great capacity  for curiosity, sympathy, and openness. Skandar Keynes has the most complex and conflicted role as Edmund, who is willful and resentful of his older brother. Tilda Swinton is perfection as the White Witch. The animals of Narnia are a combination of real animals and computer generated ones, which makes for mixed results. Real wolves make the chase scenes fabulously suspenseful, while the CG Mr. and Mrs. Beaver don't look remotely real, so it's a good thing they are comic characters. The lion Aslan skirts the line between realistic appearance and animated, but the dramatic scene of his death is so affecting that the audience won't doubt him.This film turns to Biblical allegory later in the story than the book does, but when it does, it's unmistakable. Don't let that put you off if you're not Christian. The Gospels are as good as source of inspiration as any other historical or mythological source, and C. S. Lewis draws on Greek and Norse mythology as well. In fact, Lewis vehemently denied that the book is allegory, although that seems to be an argument over semantics more than substance. \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" is a cinematic spectacle replete with strange creatures, talking animals, great battles, stunning production design, drama, and adventure, grounded for the audience by the emotions and choices of 4 very human youngsters.The DVD (Disney 2006 single disc): Bonus features on the single disc edition are \"The Bloopers of Narnia\" (5 min), \"Discover Narnia Fun Facts\", which are pop-up facts about Narnia by C.S. Lewis' stepson Douglas Gresham that can be enabled to play during the movie, and 2 audio commentaries. The first audio commentary is by director Andrew Adamson and the actors who played the children: William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie Henley. Adamson leads the commentary and contributes some technical details, while the actors recall filming each scene, including some amusing on-set anecdotes. The second audio commentary is by director Andrew Adamson, production designer Roger Ford (by phone from Australia), and producer Mark Johnson. Adamson contributes some more technical details, information about locations, comments on adapting the book, and a little bit about visual effects. Roger Ford has interesting things to say about set and prop design. Captioning for the film is available in English. Subtitles and dubbing are available in French and Spanish.\n",
      "This movie was great. It really was cool. I really like the movie. i enjoyed it so much!!!!!!!!\n",

      "This movie was excellent but in my opinion was missing key elements of the book, especially during battle scenes and other scenes with Lucy and Edmund.  Overall, very well done.  Wonderful special effects.\n",
      "This is now one of my favorite Disney movies. Everything about this movie was great. The Two-Disc Disney DVD has a lot of great features, but I am a little disappointed that they did not include any deleted scenes on the special edition.\n",
      "Given as a birthday gift to my 9 year old grandson. Surprised at all the content of the package, beside the main DVD. Story is excellent and one he will learn from and hopefully watch again and again. He has not watched it yet to my knowledge.\n",
      "I am so glad that I opted for the collector's edition of \"The Chronicles of Narnia\".  There is a lot of really interesting bonus information.  The kids and I really enjoyed all of the footage!\n",
      "I read The Lion, Witch and The Wardrobe over 50 years ago when I was a child, although, for some reason, I don't remember it being called the Chronicles of Narnia.  But at any rate, I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD.  It was well worth the price!\n",
      "This movie truly captivated me. Though I was never much of a fan of the book it was based on (I prefer the others in the series, particularly Magician's Nephew and Voyage of the Dawn Treader) it was a really good movie. Through some force outside of my control I ended up seeing it three times in theaters, and it did not decrease in enjoyment at all. To the contrary, it got better.Before I go into details I want to say one thing: James MacAvoy truly outdoes himself as Mr. Tumnus, and he so transformed that character from just another guy to my favorite person in the movie that I had to mention him.I won't go into the plot, since most everyone is familiar with it. The landscapes were breathtakingly pretty, even the pastoral English countryside in the \"real\" world. The acting was great for the most part (except for Peter. I was wincing through every one of that kid's lines) and even Georgie Henley, a very young actress, was excellent as Lucy.Yes, there were some scenes not in the book, and the stab-sword-in-ice thing was strange, but for the most part this didn't have any real flaws. Liam Neeson was probably the best choice for Aslan, as his voice evokes wisdom but gets straight to the point. All the children were good (except for Peter, but I've mentioned that already.) When it meant to be emotional, it was emotional. And when it meant to be breathtaking, it was.One of the best cinematic parts was when the camera focused on the map of the battlefield and then flew down into it. Who didn't feel their heart soar right then? The cinematography was very well done.I don't have anything but praise for this movie, really. It was a great experience, worthy of several re-watchings, and I can't wait for Prince Caspian and the others.Rating: Very Good\n",
      "I loved the book, and I love the movie. The story was fantastic and my favorite aspect of the movie was the MUSIC. I've never heard such beautiful soundtrack music in a long time. As for the kiddie who said it was a snorefest? Possibly because you play too many video games nowadays. I love Harry Potter, I love Lord of the Rings, I love Star Wars, and I love Chronicles of Narnia. Not a snorefest at all. It's a well-directed, acted, and musically-composed movie.\n",
      "I read the book as a child and now required my daughter to read it before I took her to see the movie.  The movie is very true to the book.  Even though I knew what was coming, the movie kept me on the edge of my seat and had me shedding few tears. This is one of the best movies of all time - for children and adults.\n",
      "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis is about four siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie,  who get sent away from their mother in London, England during World War II. They are sent to the Scottish countryside to live with an old professor. During a game of hide-n-seek, Lucy finds a wardrobe in a spare room which she discovers is a portal to a magical world called Narnia. But in Narnia there’s a war going on between Aslan, a legendary hero, and the White Witch, the imposter Queen of Narnia. The four siblings are told it is their destiny to defeat the White Witch and restore peace to Narnia once more. They join forces with Aslan and are victorious. They are crowned kings and queens of Narnia forever. I liked this movie and recommend it  for kids who enjoy stories where girls get to be the heroes!\n",
      "great family movie. great life lessons. It is one of our favorite movies. Definitely one to watch over and over.\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia is a mind-blowing film. The kids did an amazing job as well as Tilda Swinton. The effects were spectacular, especially the battle scenes and the lion. Not as good as The Lord of the Rings but another great film from a classic novel. This movie is deffinetly a must-see.\n",
      "Great fun for the young at heart. I've worked in film for many years and this is a great visual production with many a technical challenge, that are beautifully put together. Nice story telling with a few scary moments for the very young at heart! But if you are wanting to know more about the making of the film and would (maybe) some day like to work in film. Then these types of box sets are a must.Enjoy,MM\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia has been a long standing favorite book series of mine.  So of course I was excited when they decided to do a movie adaptation.  I had a little trepidation as movies are not usually as good as the books, but this one surprised me very much.  It really did justice to the book, and even the scenes that weren't in the book still fit very well into the story.Four children are evacuated to the countryside during World War II.  While there, Lucy, the youngest, stumbles upon a wardrobe that leads her into a different world.  A world named Narnia.  The rest of the children come with her later and learn that they are part of a prophecy.  They will help overthrow the White Witch who has made Narnia into a winter wonderland for the past one hundred years.  With the help of Aslan, the great lion, they will fight the white witch for the hope of Narnia.Characters:William Moseley: Peter PevensieAnna Popplewell: Susan PevensieSkandar Keynes: Edmund PevensieGeorgie Henley: Lucy PevensieTilda Swinton: JadisLiam Neeson: AslanJames McAvoy: Mr. TumnusRay Winstone: Mr. BeaverDawn French: Mrs: BeaverKiran Shah: GinarrbrikJim Broadbent: Professor Digory KirkeElizabeth Hawthorne: Mrs. MacreadyJames Cosmo: Father ChristmasI think that all of the characters were well cast in this movie.  I especially liked Georgie as Lucy Pevensie.  She had the right touch of innocence and bravery and really pulled off the part well.  But then again the rest are pretty good too.  Edmund is such a brat at the beginning that I really disliked him.  Mr. Tumnus was just plain cute and sweet and the beavers were also pretty great as well.  The only character I didn't really like was Jadis and that was just because she was more weird than creepy.  But maybe that was the effect they were going for since it was Disney.This movie didn't stray from the book too far.  There were a couple of scenes that weren't in the book, but as said before, I thought they really fit in with the story well.  The special effects were also extremely good.  I had always wondered how they would handle a centaur and a unicorn and they both came out looking extremely realistic. I didn't think the dryads were as good.  I just envisioned a different interpretation for them.  The music is by far one of the best features of the film.  It was just so hauntingly pretty and invoked a \"Narnian\" sense of wonder through the film.  I especially liked the song that played during the initial train ride.  I don't know its name, but it was beautiful.Great movie adaptation of a great book.  I find it hard to be in any way disappointed with this movie.Review by M. Reynard 2011\n",
      "This movie is great. The children Lucy, Susan, Edmund, and Peter was played by great acting. The Lion (Christ like) was great as well. This was better than the 2000 BBC release. The animals look so real looking. Maybe they were real animals. Worth watching to get a bibical feel from it. This beats the Lord of the Rings. I watched it twice thats how great it was.Ron - Philadelphia, PA\n",
      "The Lion, The With, And The Wardrobe has been a staple of childrens' literature for decades.  Much like The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings.  In fact, Rings author Tolkein and Lewis were friends.  Hmmm.  Drawing parallels.  Peter Jackson took The Lord Of The Rings and awed us and in effect raised the bar for anyone doing a classic series in the future.  Enter The Chronicles of Narnia.  Big budget.  Unknown star.  Walt Disney backing.  What could possibly go wrong.  The answer is nothing.  The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe is visually stunning.  Its epic.  It's envisions Lewis' tale to the fullest extent.  Sure, there are some minor violations of story as prescribed by the novel, and I sure that's going to freak out the purists and C.S. Lewis diehards, but...who cares.  I was always into Tolkein way, way more than the Narnia books.  If the film has any drawbacks it's that, having read the book, it's so exact as to be a bit boring in parts.  You already know what's going to happen.  The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe was always the most popular of the Narnia saga and it will be interesting to see what they make of the other, lesser-read, lesser-known Narnia books.  Overall...your kids will love this movie because it has everything.  Aldults who read the book may find it sort of tedious in places.  Otherwise, great effort and pure family entertainment.Dig it!\n",
      "i love this movie.  love the special effect.  it kept my attention during the whole duration of the movie.  great for children to watch.  no profanity.  nice clean movie.\n",
      "No complaints. Came very quickly and as promised. Just finished the book with my son so we will be watching it in next day or two.\n",
      "In anticipation of the film, I finally read \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\" for the first time.  It is a wonderfully imaginative and compelling story, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the new film is very faithful to its source.  I think longtime fans of the \"Narnia\" book series will appreciate the film's respect for C.S. Lewis's writings, and even those not familiar with the series should enjoy the exciting film.The film's special effects (of which there are many) are some of the best of 2005, making the talking animals and mythical creatures in Narnia completely convincing (instead of distracting).  However, I was the most surprised by how good the film's acting was.  Tilda Swinton is deliciously evil as the White Witch, but the real surprise came from the acting abilities of the four central children, who really seem like siblings onscreen.  Especially noteworthy is Georgie Henley, who plays Lucy, the youngest of the siblings.  Henley's performance is wonderful throughout the film, winning over the audience without ever becoming cutesy.  It's a shame the three main \"Harry Potter\" kids were not this strong in the first of their films (though they have improved with each installment).I definitely recommend seeing \"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe,\" and I hope they make more \"Narnia\" films soon.  If this first film is any indication, the series could be a worthy successor to the now-completed \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy.\n",
      "I ordered this video for my niece for Christmas and she just loved it!  Thanks\n",
      "a must have movie in your collections. everyone loves it. a great family entertainment . this is a movie that you can watch over and over again.\n",
      "Great!A well done movie version of a book that was as well written and with such details as the movie.Bravo!\n",
      "I really enjoyed this movie. It was a really good story, and good for any kid to watch. Would recommend.\n",
      "This is a magical movie for the old and the very young.  So much fun to watch with a young child full of imagination!\n",
      "I recommended it to a friend who was a school teacher. She had never heard of it. She was very surprised when she watched it.\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Widescreen Edition)\n",
      "I was captivated from start to finish!  This movie really moved me; I felt as if I were no longer in the theatre...I was there...the sacrifice of the Lion was the most touching scene to me.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone...it is a great movie for our time and years to come.\n",
      "My husband, Son & myself watch this movie all the time. Good verses evil is what it boils down to all 3 of these movies are great for a rainy day\n",
      "I watched this on TV a lot, but had not bought it.  It is in my collection and I am quite happy with it.\n",
      "I have read several of the reviews on this movie, and have to say that I think those giving this movie only two stars and calling it boring or comparing it to Lord of the Rings are missing the point entirely.  I have a five year old and a seven year old, and as much as I love Lord of the Rings, I would never ever consider letting THEM watch it! Narnia is a CHILDREN'S movie.  My children thouroughly enjoyed it, and so did I.  I watched it with an open mind and kept in mind the context in which it was offered, and the audience it was targeting.  I was glad that I could share it with my children.  They were wide eyed and so impressed with how real all the characters looked.  They have watched it again and again.  I think it is charming, and I am very very glad there was not a bloody battle scene, or I would not have been able to let my children watch it!  If you didn't grasp the concept that this was a family movie, then you have no one to blame for your disappointment but yourself. Next time you go to watch a Disney film, remember who Disney is making the film for.  If you are expecting to see a movie that has realistic battle scenes, intense action and academy award winning performances, stick to the R rated movies, and leave the PG rated ones to the families!\n",
      "I first read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe in 2002 when I was eight. Since seeing this movie in 2005 when it was released, I loved it immediately. The plot is accurate to the original book by C.S Lewis. I love the Christian metaphors that are interwoven throughout. I think the cast and crew all did an amazing job :) This movie gets two thumbs up from me. The background music is awesome as well and very fitting with the movie.\n",
      "As a child I read and reread C.S. Lewis' books.  I wanted to find a god like Aslan who was kind and loving yet firm and steadfast.  When I heard that a movie was going to be made I had fear that the Disney machine would ruin it.  Imagine my surprise when it was wonderful.  I cried when Aslan stepped out of the tent.  He looked just as my little girl imagination wanted him to fearsome and kind.  I would recommend this movie to anyone with a heart.\n",
      "love this book and movie! i bought it for my 10 year old daughter, explained to her the biblical connection before and during her reading the book. then, we rented the movie and did a comparison/contrast between the book and movie. then, i was moved to read the book and enjoyed it. now we're going to read the entire series!!! i even allowed my 4 year old son to watch the movie, and explained the lion aslan was like Jesus. he did great with the movie and asks to see it all the time. definitely recommend this book and movie to anyone at any age (who can comprehend the biblical connection or who wouldn't be scared if they don't understand the symbolism). also, this book is fantasy. i loved that part!!! quite interesting!!! be prepared for fantasy characters that the movie brings to life, whom we all loved!!! awesome and amazing movie!!! going to search to see if they have movies for the other books in this series after we read them!!!!\n",
      "WOW is all I can say. The film followed the book about 95-98%. The early reviews were right, its a movie for children and a movie for adults w/ inner children still.It is a movie about growing up, and not knowing how to feel about it. About suddenly having responsibility and owning up to it, all the while not loosing track of the wonder of childhood, and what it is to be a child. A truely great movie.It also is a movie I could see alot of people not liking or missing the point of, but then there will be the fortunate ones who do get it and let it touch them inside and be transported, like I was, to this magical land of Narnia and go on this amazing ride w/ these four exceptional kids.However this is the all important key, I feel, to enjoying this movie; you have to want to enjoy it, to let it entrance you. If you're skeptical in the least, you will be disappointed. This isn't \"Lord of the Rings\", although the similarities are impossible to ignore, however LOTR has more depth and well more time to do things right. Narnia is a different story, and a good one too and also a faithful adaptation of its source material.By far my favorite moment is about 12-15 minutes into the movie, when little Lucy (who by the way steals the movie, and is just adorable and, as w/ all the kids really, is incredibly good in the movie) first enters the wardrobe and steps into the snow forest of Narnia. The expression on her face and the beautiful music in the scene (and the whole movie really) just make one of the precious few movie moments that you remember all your life. Like when Dorothy enters Oz or when Darth Vader comes aboard the rebel transport in the original Star Wars or the D-day battle in Saving Private Ryan. Its just an amazing moment.The film is about 2 hours and 15 minutes or so, but never feels like it. As I said, its only like 12 minutes and you get your first glimpses of Narnia and the plot begins. Also the opening 2-3 minutes showing the 1940 bombings of London (the blitz) are short but very powerful, and the following scene where the children are getting there identification attached to there clothing by there mother in the train station before being sent out to the countryside along w/ all the other children is just a heart wrenching scene, and very early makes you feel and care about these kids alot.I look forward to a possible extended edition DVD, as LOTR did, but at the same time I don't know what they'd add. The movie is a great fantasy film, and great way to escape into a marvelous world for a few hours.\n",
      "I don't think I've ever used the phrase, \"a movie everyone can enjoy\" to describe a movie, but I'll do it here. OK, done. I'll give props where it's due, for a PG movie for kids, this was surprisingly engaging, non-cliché, and very, very well written.There aren't a lot of fantasy movies I like, and that has to do with the way they're presented to you. They present the world to you in an already existing state, bombarding you with everything without gradually introducing you to its various elements. They present these life or death scenarios without truly exploring why we're supposed to care about the world's inhabitants in the first place. I like this movie because we're learning about the world at the same rate as the four kids here (assuming you haven't read the books, which I haven't). In fact, it was the great acting done by the kids that kept me interested enough in the \"pre-fantasy\" portions of the movie before we finally entered the fantastical realm, after which I cared enough about the characters to be invested in their ultimate outcomes.**The character Lucy single-handedly kept me interested with her GREAT acting in the beginning where she was prominently featured. She was better than a good 70-83% of grown actresses that I've seen, and probably 98% of child actresses not named Dakota Fanning and a select other few. I loved her response when asked by the faun about the human beings' hand-shaking ritual. \"Yeah, I don't know, why DO we do that??\"**I loved the interaction between the kids. I loved the tension there. In most PG movies the good guys are usually black and white, you don't have ugly things like traitors, jealousy, and greed.**A mark of a well-written movie is how many times you DON'T have to say to a character on screen, \"why are you doing that?\" or \"why AREN'T you doing this?\" Prime example, in the beginning after Lucy returned from Narnia as she re-entered the wardrobe, the character specifically knew that she had been gone for apparently hours, so as she re-enters, the first thing she does is to shout out to everyone who inevitably will be worried about her, that she's OK. After they question her, she then realistically asks, \"wait, what? You mean to tell me that after our hide and seek game, from your perspective I must've disappeared for hours, and you didn't wonder where I was???\" That's perfect. That's exactly how a real person would behave, and the actress pulled off the well-written lines just as perfectly, as she questioned her siblings with a confused look. I'm pointing this out because I can specifically think of other movies with analogous situations where the lines the character would've said would've been ALL wrong, and the intonation with which the actor delivers the line would've been so unrealistically understated.I only have a couple complaints:**When the lion is lying dead on the concrete slab, and Lucy and Susan go up to him, I don't understand why Lucy was so easily talked out of using the injury healing potion she was given by...Santa Claus earlier. She first begins to use it, but then is told by Susan that it's too late, implying that since he's already dead, the potion would do no good since it's meant to heal injuries only. But how did she know the exact boundaries or properties of this magic elixir? It's MAGIC. How do you know that it won't revive him? No one specifically ever defined its limitations. Besides, what's the worst that could happen? Just pour the liquid on his wound, worst-case scenario is you get red dye on his fur (I didn't know until later you're supposed to consume the potion, not apply it directly to the wound).**I didn't like the sword fighting scene between Peter and the witch. It just looked weak, like they were struggling to swing the sword(s). Peter, I can understand, since he's a kid, but the witch should have been a lot smoother using the dual swords.**This one is minor, but, the grown versions of the kids at the end just looked very goofy.Those are hardly plot holes or badly written scenes however. If my only major gripe about a 2 hour+ movie is the non-use of a Phoenix Down on a fallen Red XIII, then it's a pretty good movie. Sure the overall arc of the story may have been predictable, but there were still plenty of dramatic moments along the way and you enjoyed the ride. The plot didn't feel contrived, it was believable for what it was, and the characters are extremely likable, to the point where I was hoping that even the CGI animals don't get hurt or killed. This movie has a lot heart and certain charm to it that leaves you happy for seeing it.***Random personal trivia: I finally saw this three years after the movie had come out, but it wasn't random. I've always had it in the back of my head that I would eventually get around to seeing this, and it was all because of an enduring three second image in my head that I remembered when they advertised this movie on TV. It was the scene at the end showing a front view of the lion and the four kids as they walk towards the camera, towards the coronation area. As corny as it sounds, there was just something noble and inspirational about that scene.\n",
      "Christian correlations aside, this is a phenonenal film.  The young actress playing Lucy shows a prowess beyond her years.  Any fan of CS Lewis will find this film amazing and at the same time lacking.  Just like his friend JRR Tolkien, Lewis creates and to a certain extent lived, in a world of imagination and therefore, his creation is vivid and hard to translate to the big screen.  Andrew Adamson and Peter Jackson did a phenomenal job bringing them to the screen.CS Lewis wrote this series and astonished the world of Christian Literature.  How a middle-aged man could write so convincingly from a child's perspective was baffling.  CS Lewis, along with his brother Warnie lived in their childhood and clung to the Norse myths like they were beloved blankets, never found without them.CS Lewis, of course, was a skeptic/agnostic and was brought to Christ in his mid 20's.  He never lost his childlike faith that made him a visionary of Christian Literature up there w/ the likes of AW Tozer.Bottom line is that, although Andrew Adamson said he consciously tried to \"de-Christianize\" this film, it is impossible.  The Christian iconography is inherent in the story and was such an integral part of the storyline that it could not be avoided.  Adamson even had Aslan utter the line \"It is finished\" when he destroyed the white witch.The film may be a bit tough for children.  Even Lewis understood that to a child, harm to an animal is often worse than harm to an adult.  What an insigt for a man that spent most of his life among literary giants rather than small children.  Therefore, in his series, the only book where animals are killed in large numbers is the last battle and a few pages later, they are resurrected with Aslan in the new Narnia (Representing the New Jerusalem, where Christ (Aslan) will reign in majesty).The death of Aslan is graphic, as it should be, and will be hard for children to digest.  But his \"deeper magic\" is a doorway to discuss Christ's love for us as sinners.  Be sure to talk to your children so they don't come away confused and understand the allegories rather than the reality of the story.One could debate all day the film deficiencies when translated from literary form.  Bottom line is that Adamson has done a sturdy job bringing Aslan to life (3 years alone to create a believeable CG lion that after years of failed attempts to make talking animals, actually looks like it is speaking) and telling his story.To the final scene where Aslan walks off down the sandy beach (the poem \"footprints\" is brought to mind for this scene), the film is beautifully executed.  Adamson could not destroy the Christian message of redemption and salvation and his \"Narnia\" is a world of wonder and spectacular vistas.Be sure to watch Lucy's face the first time she steps into Narnia.  You will feel like a child again yourself.  CS Lewis would be proud.  He was adamantly against any attempt to bring Aslan to the screen/stage and stated they would all fall short of his writing of Him.  I believe he would be startled at the vision on the screen.My only scene beef is when Aslan roars and the children respond.  In the book, Aslan's roar is such that the children tremble with fear and awe.  I wanted to see a bit more of that on the children's faces.Overall, a fantastic job, bravo...\n",
      "I HAVE 3 DAUGHTERS IN COLLEGE WHO LOVE LOVE LOVE TO READ THEY HAVE VARIED AND THEY ALL LOVED THIS BOOK AND MOVIE. THEY CAN STILL REMEMBER WHERE THEY WERE WHEN THEY FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE AND READ BOOK\n",
      "I enjoyed this movie to the extreme!  The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is, without question, one of the best (and most successful) films to be released from the present decade.  This highly anticipated motion picture has proven itself to be popular with people of all ages the world over.  When I went to go see this I was greatly captivated by the story's central players.  The four main protagonists (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) each have extremely unique personalities.  Once agian, the film, its story, and its characters made me glow all over with happiness.  The beginning of the picture is somewhat interesting whilst the ending is intensely overwhelming.  I sparkled with pleasantness when our heroes came out on top.  I have every intention on purchasing the DVD when it gets released.  In my opinion, the movie itself deserves to be honored and crowned!Long live the realm of Narnia!\n",
      "One of our family's favorite books. This movie stayed absolutely true to the story. The acting and special effects were wonderful. We will be watching this one over and over and over.\n",
      "I loved the movie when I saw it in theatres. It is beautifully illustrated and the characters are great. Definitely recommend.\n",
      "Absolutely awesome film.ALl the choices made with actors, scenes, look, cinematography and the whole tone of the flic has kept me spellbound on numerous viewings.A truer fantasy adaption you could not get, leave your cynacism at the door for this one.\n",
      "It was a great movie. We had seen it before ordering it. Probably suitable for ages 9/10 and up. The scene where Aslan in sacrificed is pretty satanic. Of course, it needs to be to make the point of Jesus death on the cross and it's true meaning.  Still, it is pretty intense for some people.\n",
      "I guess I must have been hidden under a rock as a child because I never heard of this series or author until the movie trailer started playing about six weeks ago and even then I had no desire to rush to the theatre to see it.  But since the box office has been putting out movies that puts the z in snooze, I started wondering about this film.  First I decided to read the book and instantly ordered the complete works, but I had no time to read it before the film was released.  So tonight I went to see this film with no expectations: and I LOVED IT.No one will win any acting awards, but I utterly loved the fantasy that was created.  I wasn't lost or wondering what was happening as some reviewer said.  The story was pretty simple to understand, but I clearly see where authors like Limmy Snicket and even J.K Rowling got their inspiration.This story is obviously the blueprint to some of the new 'classics' children are reading today.The film accomplishes exactly what it's intended to do: entertain.  Bravo.\n",
      "It had been a very long time since I had seen the original and had heard much hype over this remake. I bought the movie on a whim and absolutely fell in love with it. This movie is for everyone that still has any bit of their child hood still inside.\n",
      "While not 100% accurate to the story, it keeps what is important and it does what is important: it keeps the spirit of the story. While every detail is not paid attention to and some things are added while others omitted, the awe and wonder of Narnia is there.\n",
      "I just had the urge to see this movie again.  The movie included scenes I don\"t recall in the television versions - probably cut out to accommodate time availability.  The story came through as it was meant to be - the sound quality was excellent as was the picture.  Any fan of this movie should see this stream - well worth it.\n",
      "Think; \" Lord of the rings:for kids\"A potentially exasperating and annoying adventure epic, actual results in an intelligent whimsical light adventure. Based on a series of C.S. Lewis books this is yet another excellent addition to the heroic mystical fairy tales which have included \"Lord of the rings\" and \"Harry Potter\".The story of 4 siblings who accidently come upon a gate way to another land is adorable. The land gripped by an evil ice witch, can only be saved by the human siblings and a warrior lion named Aslan. The sibings must find not only their way accross the plains, forest, mountains and lakes, but also must find the willingness in themselves to become true noble, leniant, valiant, caring kings and Queens of Narnia.The bad part is some of the special effects weren't as clean as they should have been Post \"Lord of the rings\" ( which basically created a blueprint for this type of film). The mythological beasts and animals often looked like cardboard cut outs. Also some of the acting was a little over the top, often felt like an middle school play.But, nonetheless a pleasant adventure, i wasn't bored and made me smile at the end. In the year of \"Doom\" and \" Domino\" can't really ask for more then that.\n",
      "This was ordered for my daughter & my three year old grandson. They love it...We all like it as it is a story that is based along the lines of the Bible. C.S.Lewis was a Christian.I would recommend it to anyone & everyone.\n",
      "As an adult I was completely taken with this film version of _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_. I confess that when I first heard about the project I had my doubts. Firstly, I wasn't sure that the excellent BBC version could be significantly improved upon. Secondly, I was afraid that they would \"modernize\" and thereby cheapen or destroy the classic. My fears were baseless. In my opinion this film is superb in every category- acting, special effects, computer animation, sets, costumes, etc. Yes, there were a few small liberties taken with the original storyline, but nothing major. This is absolutely true to the spirit of the original and the best adaptation yet. No doubt this will be the classic and definitive film version for generations to come.As for the special features, you get Narnia \"bloopers\", fun facts, and audio commentaries. The second time you watch the film through you will want to turn the \"fun facts\" on, for it displays a wealth of information about Lewis and his work in little boxes. I know that I shall definitely watch my copy through a second time as soon as possible.\n",
      "I won't repeat the plot,it has already been done!This movie is A fantastic movie for kid s of all ages!even for adults!if you wish to spend a good afternoon with your family and friends this movie is a must see for everybody!A good movie for all audiences!\n",
      "Narnia falls somewhere in between Harry Potter and Middle Earth, being directed at younger audiences like Potter, but with a detailed world and epic battles like Lord of the Rings.Follows the book fairly closely, but this is not your modern, silly kids book. The film opens with the bombing of London in WWII where the kids are evacuated to the countryside. Once in Narnia, the kids encounter a wide array of creatures (friend and foe). Not as epic feeling (until the end) as LOTR, but nor is the book. It's a short book and stretching it to just over 2 hours and still having a fairly good pace is an achievement.The visuals were done by 3 or 4 of the world's leading FX companies, a first on any movie. This was necessary because all of the residents of Narnia are either animals, creatures or half-human beings.I hope the film makers will release an extended edition DVD with all the extras, like the LOTR maker's did. This fantasy series deserves the same A+ treatment. Disney is expected to announce the first sequel shortly.\n",
      "This movie is slammin'!Loved it!Go out and see it.Word to The Twizzler! He called it right about what some knuckleheads are going to be up to up in here.\n",
      "And you can listen to everyone else who loves it too!The only gripes I have is that the special edition doesnt include an \"extended version\" with all the \"lost\" footage... I guess I'm just spoiled from the Lord of the Rings movies... :)\n",
      "This is a great movie that was fun to watch and has a great spiritual message. I was reminded of the greatness of Jesus' kingship.\n",
      "I loved this movie.  It's so full of beautiful scenery, clever dialogue...and such amazing fantasy characters!  I loved it. It's a kids' movie, but it's just as entertaining for adults. There's a great plot and it's more or less what you want it to be. If you are a Christian, you can see lots in it (the gifts that the children receive are like the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Aslan is a type of Jesus, etc. The witch has satanic attributes.  Edmund's journey is very much like that of the Prodigal son) but if you are not a Christian, it can be a simple adventure movie with heroes and antiheroes and basic moral lessons to be learned:  the children learn to stop squabbling and get along. Each one matures and learns to be obedient and compassionate. There's a lot about forgiveness and hope and courage and joy and love... it's a great movie and the character of Aslan is really beautiful: gentle and mighty at the same time.  Just beautiful. So many kids' movies these days are full of lame jokes and cheap laughs.  This one is a classic, a real keeper...\n",
      "this movie is very entertaining, also the lion represents Jesus who is risen and in Heaven.  Praise God.May the Lord be with you.\n",
      "Our granddaughter had seen this before but requested that we order it.  We love watching it with her, and will do so again next week.\n",
      "For those of you who aren't familiar with the story, I'll give you a brief overview (which won't spoil anything): We start off with the four Pevensie children who are sent away from their mother and home in England because of the dangers of World War II. They arrive at a huge, old mansion to live with a mysterious professor. While the children are playing games, they discover a wardrobe hidden upstairs which takes them into the magical world of Narnia. We soon discover that Narnia is under a spell which makes it \"always winter and never Christmas\", and it has been this way for nearly 100 years. In this fantastical world there are talking animals, both good and bad, and the awesome King of Narnia, The Great Lion, Aslan...... The story that follows - which I won't tell you any more because I hope that you will experience it for yourself - is an exciting story of hope, courage, faith, sacrifice, and love; and is truly one of the most beautiful stories I have ever heard.I am a huge fan of the Chronicles of Narnia series - they are simply my favorite fiction books that I've ever read. In saying that, I was extremely interested in seeing this movie and seriously hoping that they would do it correctly. Having now seen the film, I don't think I could be more pleased with the loving adaptation.First (in my analysis of the film itself), I think they captured the theme and tone of the book perfectly and these are truly felt in watching the movie. It isn't your 'typical' Disney style of movie, nor did they give it a politically-correct treatment. Christianity is woven into these stories and is necessary to give Narnia its magic. C.S. Lewis has even said that Aslan is the representation of what Jesus would be like were he to enter Narnia (not in those exact words, but close to them). And almost to my surprise, they did not hide the story's Christian themes whatsoever. As a Christian, myself, I am so truly greatful for that.Also, the acting was absolutely superb. The children were exceptionally real as individuals and they functioned very well as the Pevensie family. Each child truly added life and depth to the movie. Also, Tilda Swinton absolutely nailed the part of the White Witch - it can't be said any better than that. She was simply perfect. Mr. Tumnus was really quite wonderful as well.The digital acting was amazing, as well. The graphics representing the characters were beautiful, that's for sure, but the care the animators took in creating the characters really shines. The beavers were magnificentally done, and the wolves were incredible, as well.But, I especially loved the way they handled Aslan. This movie just wouldn't make it if they hadn't brought Aslan to life on the screen. He really stole every scene he was in, as he well should have. I was truly in awe of him for the entire movie and I teared up the first time that I saw him. His emotions are very vivid, and he truly is terrifying, exciting, and wonderful at the same time. Also, Liam Neeson's voice was absolutely perfect for Aslan, as his voice provided the gentleness, magnificence, and awesome power necessary for Aslan's character.The adaptation from the book was incredibly done, as well. They stayed so extremely close to the source material for pretty much the entirety of the movie. I'll admit that it was a little painful to at first upon the realization that a plot point had been altered, but in the very few places this occurred, in retrospect, the additions are welcomed and truly add to the story. The characters are given considerably more depth with the additional time. Also, there are more tense scenes and action that plays out perfectly for the silver screen.The overall look and feel of Narnia is very real; we really feel like we are in Narnia and that this place does exist. The beautiful cinematography and extremely believable effects bring the fantastic land to life. Also, the animals (talking or not) provide realism. The costumed/made-up and digital characters look amazing on the screen.All around, this is just an incredible film. It is deserving of Oscar consideration in multiple categories, and I definitely believe it is worthy of Best Picture consideration. This movie has it all, and even exceeded the expectations of a person who cherishes the book. I thank all who helped to breathe life into this film, allowing countless people to enter C.S. Lewis' amazing world of Narnia. I can only hope that all seven novels will be given this wonderful treatment and that we will continue to have such quality entertainment for years to come!\n",
      "After reading the Chronicles and reviewing movie, I can give this first part a thumbs up on a scale of 1 to 10, a 9 because of the \"hankie\".\n",
      "Great movie for the whole family. A good movie for all ages. Very beautiful visually. The child actors were amazing.\n",
      "its a wonderful imaginitive movie, that is adequate for all ages and anybody wanting a good movie. at a great price\n",
      "My favorite childhood book is now a movie.  Excellent interpretation, animation is exquisite and the color and scenery is fantastic.\n",
      "This movie was well done and well put together and I don't think CS Lewis would be disappointed. Granted the movie didn't follow the book completely-it was pretty darn close. So I'm not disappointed. The effects were not over the top, which is how I like it for this kind of movie. The acting was as to be expected and the children did a wonderful job.If you don't know what the story is about, I suggest reading the book. It's about a set of children, all siblings, get sent to a relative's house while there is a war going on. While at this mansion, little Lucy stumbles upon a magical wardrobe. The wardrobe lands them into the chaos world of Narnia. Where it's currently under the control of the Witch. When the 4 kids come into the Narnia land, things start to change for the better. The Witch becomes weaker, Aslan comes back to the land and the Sons and Daughters are presented with the thrones to be Kings and Queens of Narnia.There is magic, there is fighting, there is loss, there is creation. All in all, very well rounded story line!! And I recommend it for children and adults alike-even if you haven't read the book!\n",
      "We have all the movies now that are based on the Chronicles of Narnia.  Our kids and grandkids love them and watch them over and over.  We truly appreciate the Christian principles that the movies are based on.  We purchased this one to replace ours that was damaged.\n",
      "I'm not going to go into depth about what the movie is about..other reviewers have done so. I just had a few things to point out which made me give the movie four stars, but the mistakes are amusing none the less.First question was, In the scene after Santa told the children winter was almost over and they noticed the ice was melting over the river....why did they walk across it. They could have gone over the top of it on the rocks...LIKE THE WOLVES DID! but I guess they needed another climax, it was a good scene just funny that the wolves could figure it out and not the \"king and queen\"Secondly, why did the wolf jump onto the sword and kill himself. He was purty =(Last...and so far I am the only one who caught this, at the beginning of the movie Lucy gave Thomas her hanky. Then when Thomas was captured, the beaver gave it back to her. But amazingly at the end of the movie...Thomas had it and gave it to her....again.....I was amused by it but GREAT MOVIE. Aslan is beautiful\n",
      "The Blu-ray quality was of good quality and the content followed the story well.  We enjoyed it well here in this household and look forward to seeing a live play of it next week.  Thank you for making it available.Daena and Daniel Wilds\n",
      "This was a good start to what could have been a great movie series.  Sadly, the writers departed from their source material, and therefore failed.\n",
      "... But I expected more I guess ... Truly more appealing to children ...\n",
      "I grew up the Chronicles Of Narnia, and I loved the ones done by the BBC, these are still really good, they just didn't take the time to build the story. I thought it was a little rushed to get to the action sequences, don't get me wrong I love the action, but it just felt...rushed.\n",
      "I honestly cannot remember if I ever read these books as a kid. I, like many, have felt a slight itch to read them now, since the movie release was somewhat of a reminder that the books even existed. I wanted to see the movie first, though. I wanted watch with attention devoid of geeky \"this-is-nothing-like-the-book\" bias.As I lay in bed on my lazy Saturday afternoon watching The Chronicles of Narnia, I definitely had the longing to be sitting in a dark movie theater, losing myself in the action on the giant silver-screen. Seeing it on DVD was not a bad thing, but I think if I had taken the time to see it in the theater it would have definitely been a good thing.In the \"books we read as children turned movies\" category, The Chronicles of Narnia was geared more towards children than Tolkien/Jackson Lord of the Rings movies.In the \"books my children may or may not have read turned movies\" category, The Chronicles of Narnia may have even been a little less sophsiticated than Harry Potter. Forgive me for saying that in The Chronicles of Narnia it seemed that a few more things were a little far-fetched. I know it seems ridiculous that I say that a young boy, his brother and sisters leading a war against an evil witch is far fetched, though the fauns and centaurs they lead into battle and a completely different story about an entire school of young wizards were completely acceptable.Some of the effects were flawless. The CG lion was masterfully done, as were most of the panoramic views. There were so many beatiful scenery shots, but some appeared lazily done. Maybe the design team had to cut a few corners, but the kids looked too blatantly super-imposed at times. This is a petty complaint, and my only one really.I had fun watching The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe. I enjoyed it thoroughly and recommend it to anyone with young kids who are yet to go through the phase where they repress their imagination or anyone who has already come out of it.\n",
      "This is an outstanding movie that I wanted in my collection to share with my family, I was not disappointed!\n",
      "Most people are not aware that C.S. Lewis is the Medieval Literature Authority of the 20th Century. Lewis was both Dom of Oxford and Cambridge Universities in the UK at the same time. Both C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien were classmates and both were understudies of George MacDonald their professor. You can see if you read MacDonald's works. C.S. wrote on the \"Light Side of Things\" -positive whereas J.R.R. Tolkien wrote on the \"Dark Side of Things\"-negative.The Chronicles of Narnia is wonderful. I believe superior in everyway to Lord of the Rings. I have read just about everything that Lewis has written. Some of his critics falsely accused him at one point for using ghost writers. He was exonerated completely. Lewis had the gifting of being able to write in several different styles as if he were several different writers. This is unique as far as my reading experience is concerned.C.S. Lewis said of his Chronicles that his series would appeal to the very young and to the very Mature Adults. I love the Chronicles as an older Adult. So when you've grown old enough come back to Narnia where all are young at heart.\n",
      "This of course was well written; C. S. Lewis is a gifted author.  See his book in movie format was wonderful.  Very Good ACTING\n",
      "The Narnia movies are well made and enjoyable for anyone who enjoys stories about things from the realm of imagination! The directing, photography, casting, and everthing is well done. I didn't give it a 5 star only because the story itself is not one of my all time favorites, but the movies is fun to watch.\n",
      "very well done and very entertaining even if you know the storyline already\n",
      "This wonderful movie gives us back the \"special effects film\" proper. Here's hoping it helps to wean younger viewers (and older ones who should know better) away from the \"might-as-well-be-a-cartoon\" overkill of the Matrix and other CGI-fests - even Jackson's Kong has, for me, one dinosaur-chase too many - and back to the mythopoeic splendours of true cinema artists like Ray Harryhausen. Setting aside the technical verisimilitude of 2001 and the zooming rockets of Star Wars, it's no coincidence that the previous benchmark for really special special effects was \"Jason and the Argonauts\"; bringing mythology to life - that is, putting real performers in the frame with mythical beasts - is the modern age's equivalent of Ovid and the rest doing it in narrative poetry. With Narnia, we finally get a worthy contemporary inheritor of those legacies, cinematic and literary.Of course, one of the secrets of a great \"special effects film\" is that the wizardry is complemented by excellence in other areas. Narnia gives us, for a start, some genuinely good child actors (English ones, to boot!) for our protagonists. The young performers here manage to convey emotion and just the right level of anachronism to chime with the story's wartime setting, without resort to jarring Harry Potterish bum notes of trendiness (or that series' often wooden, school-play delivery of the juvenile dialogue). Georgie Henley in particular is absolutely pitch-perfect in her depiction of little Lucy's delight, terror, sadness, and, above all, innocent wonder - the perfect \"Disney kid,\" in fact (and much, much better than that brand might imply).The Narnia grown-ups are also fantastic, similar streaks ahead of the Potter adult rota: compare James Cosmo's brief and brilliant Father Christmas here with the Dumbledores of Harris and Gambon, for example. Better still, put Tilda Swinton's subtly terrifying White Witch against any of cinema's fear-queens and she's going to come out at the top. James McAvoy's faun is a touching demonstration of that actor's striking versatility.Meanwhile, on the voice-over front, we have Ray Winstone's delightful Mister Beaver (paired with a Dawn French thankfully restrained from making this character \"her own\" (i.e. not funny)), a great, appropriate fox from Rupert Everett and many other fine vocalisations, culminating in a gloriously leonine sound-portrait of Aslan from Liam Neeson.The story is already established as a modern classic; the screenplay is pretty faithful. Pacing, cinematography (a glorious colour palette is on view throughout) and music are all fine, too. But the breath is most taken, of course, by the beautifully-integrated effects. When I spoke of the voice-over performances just now, you have to see what amazing justice is done to the real actors by their animated counterparts (and vice-versa). Facial expressions, body-language, authentic animal behaviour and anthropomorphic adaptations are welded in magnificent style, convincing and entertaining at the same time. The wolves look as real as the centaurs; the demons are as alive as the cheetahs; the gryphon (the gryphon!) is somehow truer to \"life\" than, say, any of the Black Beauties we've seen filmed. The phoenix is astounding. In true Jason style, we also get a harpy, taunting Aslan on his way to his execution.The masterpiece in this gallery of wonders, indeed, has to be Aslan; the lion is real; super-real; moving just for being so beautifully realised, before we even come to the deeper emotion of his sacrifice. This scene, if you were in any doubt before, convinces us that we're watching art in motion. I haven't seen Bosch paintings move before, but this riot of grotesques would grace any canvas of his, or Duhrer's. Clive Barker would probably recognise the more hellish dimension of the scene, too. Tilda Swinton is at her most chilling here; and the quasi-religious pathos outdoes Mel Gibson's sadistic little go at it in \"The Passion of the Christ\" by many miles. It's at least as horrific as, and much more touching than, Edward Woodward's exit in the Wicker Man; cinematically no less significant, either - this is, at most levels, a \"children's\" film (and definitely an \"effects\" film), so the compliment to intelligence and maturity is much appreciated: yes, we can respond to sacrifice without the conventional frameworks, thank you.In every respect, Narnia is one of cinema's genuine and precious works of art. It's brilliant; you should see it. And if it's going to be classed as an effects, fantasy and/or kids' film, then it has to be installed at the top of all those categories. For my money, though, it should be put firmly in the classic ranks; and actually rated as one of the finest of all time.\n",
      "The movie is such a great allegory of the power of Christ against this world's evil which is being directed by the evil spiritual force, satan. Jesus is the only hope. He is called the lion of the tribe of Judah. CS Lewis was a committed Christian who understood the power of GOD in Christ. Jesus gave HIS life, died on the cross to pay for mankind's sins. Then HE rose from the dead so that we could have our hope in the only ONE who conquered death. Believe in HIM and be saved.\n",
      "I purchased this movie simply because I'm a fan of CS Lewis' Narnia series. My husband, 5 yr old son & I have watched it several times & we talk about the moral, lessons learnt & everytime we watch it we end up picking out different traits to talk about. It definitely deserves 5 stars.\n",
      "There have been many previous versions of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, the first volume of Oxford Don C.S. Lewis' beloved children's classics, 'The Chronicles of Narnia.'  This version is by far the best.The basic plot:  The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is the story of the Pevensie children, Lucy, Peter, Edmund, and Susan.  The are sent out of London during the Blitz and fostered in the home of the mysterious \"professor.\"  During a game of hide and seek, the youngest child (Lucy- brilliantly played by Georgie Henley)finds the gate to the mystical world of Narnia through an old wardrobe. Narnia is inhabited by humans, mythical beasts, and anthropomorphic creatures.  It has been under the hundred-year rule of the evil White Witch (well-done but a bit understated by Tilda Swinton).  The children fulfill a prophecy and come to lead the fight against the witch.As one might expect from Lewis, possibly the most readable theologian ever, the tale is a straight good-evil story and contains much Christian symbolism.  The sacrifice and resurrection of the Lion (of Judah) Aslan, and his descent to free the damned captives of the Witch are fairly obvious.Being as this is a children's story, it is, naturally, an uncomplicated tale.  The movie pulls it off well, and the CG effects are fabulous, and a good complement to the fine acting.Well cast, and with appealing cinematography, it is no wonder the film was a hit.  The DVD is of good quality and worth owning, for adults and kids.One small caveat is that the film is unabashedly English in character and parents might have to do a little explaining.  Another small failing is that the CG of the bombing raid in the Blitz looks fairly bogus, unlike the rest of the film.But, on the whole, a superb movie to add to any film buff or parent's collection!\n",
      "focus on the negative and ya won't have much fun.  focus on the positive and ya will have much fun.  narnia is a cool movie.  go see it, but not with preconceptions in yer pocket.\n",
      "I'm the great fan of this movie. I went to the theatre for the premiere show of it. Of course, I strongly recommend this Special Two-Disc Collectro's Edition. Not only how great movie it is. But including the magnifecent score by Harry Gregson-Williams, WETA workshop from The Lord of The Rings and The Beautiful scenery from New Zealand. Also, this exclusive edition includes almost 10 hours of bonus features. It's a must-buy movie!\n",
      "This movie is an excellent display of not straying far from the good book! Andrew Adamson did a great job with this movie though you should stay away from the prince Caspian disaster movie he churned out. But about this movie it was virtually identical though of course (as always) a few liberties were taken, though nothing that ripped the book apart. the biggest discrepancy between this movie and the book was the battle that only lasted 2 pages in the book but takes up a larger part of this movie crowding out the interesting part where Aslan frees the stone captives of the witch. also was the frozen river scene, where the Pevensies are trapped between a melting frozen waterfall and Maugrim. The special effects were spectacular and the actors were also spectacular! Liam Neeson played the part of Aslan so well! All in all a great movie that followed the book very closely.\n",
      "Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are four children misplaced by war.  They have gone to live in the country side, where they will be safe from the destruction of bombs and air attacks.  Peter, the eldest, feels as though he must take on the role of the parent in this upsetting situation, and he often argues with his brother Edmund, who tries to hide his bitterness about the war by picking fights with his siblings.  Susan is the second eldest, and, like Peter, tries to encourage her younger siblings while also being realistic about the situation.  Lucy is the youngest, and despite the fact that she is young and usually has to be taken care of by Peter or Susan, she is really very brave.  The children are now living with a professor in a spacious mansion, which they find is the perfect setting for a game of hide-and-seek.  But when Lucy hides in a mysterious wardrobe in a back room, she is taken to an amazing world.  But this is only the beginning of an unbelievable adventure full of suspense, amazing creatures, and an exciting battle of good vs. evil.Rarely do I say that a movie is better than the book, but this movie was absolutely incredible.  The storyline, of course, was fantastic, considering as it was based on one of the most beloved children's stories of all time.  But the thing I liked was that it was true to the story.  Parts weren't mixed around and nothing unecessary was added into it.  The acting was also fantastic, especially from Georgie Henley (Lucy) as young as she is.  The special effects were very high-tech and really made the movie.  I recommend this movie to everyone, even people who haven't read the book. (Although it's neat to see the book come to life on the screen.) Some parts may frighten small children, but for the most part it wasn't as disturbing as some movies today.Overall, it was just a work of art.  This is one of my favorite movies now.\n",
      "I have to give it four stars as I never give a movie from a book five but this one was close.  Of course the movie was very well done but the extra features on this DVD Set are actually very interesting and worth the extra money.  I'm used to getting extras like director interviews and extra bloopers which is fine but not always worth paying more for.  You do get a lot of production content but you get an entire DVD about C.S. Lewis and different viewpoints of what the land of Narnia meant to him.  Its like two good movies in one except one is fiction and one is documentary.At any Rate if you are a Narnia Fan and are not one of those who constantly compare movies to literature then this is indeed a great buy for you.  Even if you do compare this will not dissapoint a great deal.\n",
      "An adaptation of the great C. S. Lewis' work brought to movies.  The performance is good and the film feels like a blockbuster movie.  Four children living in war torn London are sent to the country side and find adventure in the world of Narnia.\n",
      "Nothing was wrong with it. It was brand new with no scratches or glitches, and I couldn't find it in any stores around me, so I'm definitely happy.\n",
      "Owning the two-disc version of \"The Chronicles of Narnia:  The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe\", I was curious to see what the four-disc extended version would add to my viewing experience.  My family and I enjoyed watching the extended scenes (Disc 1), particularly the \"Battle for Narnia\".  I was pleasantly surprised by both Disc 3 and Disc 4.Disc 3 \" C.S. Lewis - Dreamer of Narnia\" is a movie that educates the viewer about the man behind the \"Narnia\" series.  Lewis' story is told in a very creative way.  It opens with footage of a real lion steadily moving through a wilderness allowing us to visualize what it must have been like before and as Aslan created Narnia.  We meet various literary and religious scholars who comment on C.S. (\"Jack\") Lewis and themes found in his writings in a clear, respectful, and warm-hearted fashion.  We hear from a former student, a taxi driver (who gives tours of significant places in C.S. Lewis' life and tells of Lewis' impact on his life), a close friend of his wife, and Douglas Gresham (C.S. Lewis's stepson and a producer of the current theatrical movies) who shares quite personal insights about \"Jack\" and his mother.  Interspersed throughout are voiceovers of \"Jack\" reading his letters aloud, giving this movie a solid narrative.  Also included are brief scenes of children as they describe what Narnia means to them (in single sentences) and read excerpts from the books.  I truly enjoyed this movie and found it quite educational.  Parental discretion is advised since footage of WWI (actual footage is not gory but includes frank descriptions of war), suicide, death from cancer, and alcoholism are topics that are mentioned.Disc 4 - \"Visualizing The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe:  The Complete Production Experience\"  is fascinating to watch as it shows the movie (theatrical version) with inserts of various members of the production team telling (and often showing) how they approached a particular element of the scene.  The producers, director, costume designer, director of photography, set designer, special effects designers & directors, cast (live and voice actors), make-up & prosthetics designer, composer, and editor are all well-represented.  Disc 4 will probably be of particular interest to anyone who loves this film and has an interest in filmmaking.\n",
      "This is a great movie, and it was brand new in a sealed package. The price is great for being a movie in the vault.\n",
      "slow to navigate and set up.  The credit card payment form was not accepted. had to change form of payment to pay with\n",
      "I never go to a children's movie expecting me, a jaded adult, to be blown away.  I am sorry for any adult that does so.  However, I did go to this movie, never having read any of the books, but merely curious about modern children's fare, and I find it superb, for children.  Or the child in us.  This movie cannot appeal to a totally \"jaded\" adult.  They will miss lust, violence, hate, revenge . . . you know, all the \"good\" stuff.  However, a child will be transported to Narnia and blown away.However, some may be more like Jadis than Aslan, and deeply resent this movie figuratively and literally.  I can easily tolerate the script and directorial approach to moralize legendary concepts such as Adam and Eve, Abel and Caine, Jesus and Satan, Heaven and Hell, providence (savior required) and self-actualization (no savior required).  Moreover, I find all these comparisons refreshing.It may be that negative critics overly compare Narnia to Hogwarts, which has a more unified theme based on witchcraft without moralizing, while Narnia portrays good versus evil, which dichotomizes and creates controversy.I mean, really, for an adult to criticize the scenery, computer generated imagery, and children actor's skills is to totally miss the point of this well-done movie targeted to children. The movie attempts to inspire imagination in children, not overwhelm with special effects.  Particularly, the child actors seemed like their characters rather than \"Academy Award nominees.\"  This is important in this movie that the children seem like just regular kids-not big time movie stars.  However, the role of the white witch requires a seasoned actress.  Nurturers of young minds and souls will get the point of this movie and praise it, while aged juvenile delinquents will only seek to egg Aslan's house.It would be a tragedy if all the books are not filmed by Disney following this style.\n",
      "As much as I liked the BBC edition, this one broke the mold that it couldn't be made well.  Like this one and even the less accurate in the series made later. But, this one is to the book and was well done with good acting, directing and effects. Recommended.\n",
      "I just watched this move today. I totally enjoyed it. I bought itbecause of Disney. Usually anything they are involved in turns out great.This movie proves it.  Narnia the magical place to go.  The cast and set was wonderful. Great story to share with the whole family.  It will be enjoyed for years to come.\n",
      "THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA:  THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is a combination of Alice In Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz, and a tame Lord of The Rings.  Readers who love good storytelling may be attracted to watch this version of C.S. Lewis' tale of four children who run inside a mysterious wardrobe into a land that remains winter all year round as a result of an evil spell left by the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).  The children later become the savior and leaders to the living creatures of the land called Narnia.  The children, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley) help to restore this enchanting land to its natural splendor from the cold and evil land it has been left to be.The film may echo Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter.  However, NARNIA has the Disney touch.  The special effects as shown with the animals and human-animal creatures is quite amazing to see: The beavers, Mr. Tumnus, the faun, (James McAvoy) is a delight, the fox (voice of Rupert Everett), and Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson).  Disney's production brings Lewis' fantasy tale alive with enchantment and heroism.  In addition, the cinematography and the soundtrack are quite dramatic through out the film, especially with aerial shots of the mountainous terrain, the particular lighting that provides a religious backdrop, and the concluding cliche battle scene.What is interesting about reading and watching the cartoon version of THE LION, WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE as a child, the religious and historical references did not occur to me.  I merely read the book for the simple pleasure and the fantasy.  After viewing the film, it follows the same premise as the book with the exception to additional scenes that were made specifically for the film.NARNIA contains historical and religious references.  The opening London bombing scene applies a historical backdrop to the film, and the period in which C.S. Lewis wrote the book.  The theme of good versus evil, and in this case, the German Nazis bombing Britain.  In terms of religion, Aslan represents the God-like creature of the film that Lewis had intended in the original text of his book.Overall, NARNIA is a film that the entire family will enjoy.  The film's PG rating shows minimal violence, but scenes with the pack of wolves may scare some audience members and the scene with Aslan on the stone table may be disturbing.  Otherwise, if you like to see a imagination in movies, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA is the fantasy film to see.\n",
      "\"And then she saw that there was a light ahead of her; not a few inches away where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been, but a long way off. Something cold and soft was falling on her. A moment later she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air. Lucy felt a little frightened, but she felt very inquisitive and excited as well... she could still see the open doorway of the wardrobe and even catch a glimpse of the empty room from which she had set out... \"I can always get back if anything goes wrong,\" thought Lucy. She began to walk forward...~The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe by C. S. LewisThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe movie is a brilliant portrayal of the eternal struggle between primal forces of evil and the beauty found in the soul of purity. This purity is displayed in the youthful innocence of the four main characters (children escaping to the country during World War II) who enter a world filled with temptations that test their sense of honor and loyalty. They learn the power of forgiveness and work on their character flaws through real-life adventures in a mythical land far from their home.Tilda Swinton gives a chilling performance as the White Witch who anticipates her power with a sense of calculated precision. Her adornment of black plumage was duly noted, however it is almost a foreshadowing for a lack of \"raven's knowledge\" and definitely an omen of death. In this world of magic and mystery, knowledge of the realm's rules is still power and the ability to change a summer butterfly into stone a much less powerful art in the light of this revelation. She is a formidable enemy but seems to have detectible flaws that undermine her power.Georgie Henley's portrayal of Lucy was perfect and her curiosity infuses the movie with an adventurous spirit to propel the story forward into a beautiful destiny. The scenery alone is worth four or more viewings, but it is the mythology, eternal struggle of good vs. evil and the hero's journey that captured my full attention. The creativity is especially beautiful in scenes were a phoenix bird changes into fire to defeat the enemy.In many former attempts to bring this story to a wider audience, Aslan never seemed as real. In this movie, Aslan is a lion that is so believable; he even conveys the deepest emotions with stunning accuracy.  Normally CGI fails to capture my emotions and for the first time, I felt it finally brought eternal truths to the surface in a very accessible way. Even the forests have tales to tell and the transition from winter to summer is a beautiful contrast of death vs. life or at least a rebirth in progress.The violence seemed more an adventure and the battles more exciting than horrifying. The suspense effectively captures your attention and the plot is exciting and unpredictable (unless you have read the books, but it even kept my full attention). The animals all talk and this adds a lot of humor to the story. Throughout the movie there is a sense of rising to the occasion and overcoming your fears. In the end, this story seems as much about the internal struggle of a soul as the outward portrayal.I'm happy to have waited to watch this at home when I could savor some delicious Turkish Delights and walk about in fluffy pink \"Old Friend Women's Scuff\" slippers (they look just like the ones Lucy has in the movie - and they have them in kid's sizes too). The trivia and commentaries add additional interest, but I'd highly recommend watching:  ASIN: B000BY9VS2 C.S. Lewis & Chronicles of Narnia - The True Story of the Author of the Classic Tale (2005)If you are looking for Turkish Delights: The ingredients are as basic as sugar, water and starch, but the flavor is smooth, slightly soft and sticky and dreamy floral sweet (look for the \"rose\" flavor). It is impossible to imagine how such perfection evolves from the list of ingredients. Look for: ASIN: B000IPZF8O - Sultans Turkish Delight. These are imported from Turkey and are the best I've ever tried.I first heard this story as a young child when a teacher started to read the book to us at school when I was living in Africa. I was the only child who wanted the teacher to continue reading (I think some were too young and were scared by the Witch) and when she didn't finish the book, I had to find the books at the library and read them myself. As a longtime fan of the Narnia books, I can say I could not have wished for more in a movie!~The Rebecca Review\n",
      "Wonderfully delicious movie. A little scary at the beginning for my 5 year old, but she still loves it. Magical and beautifully done.\n",
      "Loved the movie, the picture and sound from this blu-ray are fantastic.  worth owning.\n",
      "Would watch it over and over again!  Rented it for my kids while traveling and it was a great entertainer during car rides!\n",
      "I really enjoyed this movie it was really clean cut. It is a clean family show.had very good lessons. When I went to the theator I went back 3 more times and could have gone again.Can't wait till the next movie comes out......\n",
      "If \"The Passion Of The Christ\" has taught me anything, it's that debating religious issues via film reviews at Amazon.com is a silly thing to do, so I'm not even going to mention the various religious subtexts in either the novel or this movie.What I am going to do is wax (almost) lyrical over this big-screen adaptation of one of my all-time favourite novels, \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\".Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie are evacuated from WWII-era London by their Mother, to a safer country manor run by intractable housekeeper Mrs. McCready. Running afoul of her strong discipline, they run and hide in a seemingly ordinary wardrobe in an abandoned room of the house, where younger sister Lucy claims to have discovered another world at the back of the closet. Literally stumbling into the land of Narnia, the four children become embroiled in a Civil War between the usurperous White Witch Jadis, and the rightful ruler of Narnia, Aslan the Lion.Firstly, the standard of acting in \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" is what makes this movie so great. Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley and Anna Popplewell as Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan respectively, give great performances, with special nods to Henley and Keynes as two of the most promising child actors I've seen since Pamela Franklin in 'Jean Brodie'. Tilda Swinton as Jadis is absolutely wonderful: regal, detached and most definitely evil, kudos must also go to the casting director for actually hiring an Actress, and not one of the several million Jessica Biels that lurk out there.Direction is fitting: this is not a story where you skimp on showmanship, and Andrew Adamson has done a truly breathtaking job here. There's so little wrong with this visual treatment of Narnia that it's possible to get almost totally lost in the film. And in an age where CGI effects and technical frivolity are so often used to fluff up a pedestrian style of filmmaking, that's a real compliment.CGI effects here are the best I've seen to date. Forget Harry Potter, forget the Lord of the Rings trilogy, forget Episode III: \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" is the current king of computer-generated plausibility. There were only two scenes where I felt \"fake!! that's fake!\", and those were (rather inexplicable) bluescreened backdrops. The creatures, the vistas, the spells, the battles... and Aslan the Lion is indescribable. You just have to see it to appreciate it.Production design is also magnificent. Narnia's various inhabitants are as varied as they are individual. From the mythic, like Giants, Hags and Naiads, to the real, like cheetahs, beavers and horses, the nonhuman inhabitants are memorable because of their sterling design. Jadis is incredible-looking, a sort of tribal queen with a real sense of power about her... and understated, considering what overstatement they could have come up with. And the countryside itself is magnificent: real and generated scenery blend here to create a backdrop that's wholly convincing, and very true to the spirit of the original book.Also, the movie's plot follows the novel closer than anything I've seen for a long time. Sure, there are changes, but for the most part, this huge fan of CS Lewis can tell you that they're not a big deal.My one quibble is with the script. Some of the dialogue feels too modern and a little too grown-up for the children. There's a glaring disparity between some of the comedy and the rest of the characterisation. The Witch and Susan seem to suffer the worst of these excesses, but worry not: it's mostly a convincing and standout screenplay.I can't recommend this highly enough. Easily the equal of the Harry Potters and Lord of the Rings, \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" deserves all the praise you can think of, and then some.Buy it now!\n",
      "Probably should have just bought it, instead of renting. My older kids love it, but some parts are still too scary for my younger kids.  Great family movie!!!\n",
      "I have loved C.S. Lewis classic fantasy tales forever and was hesitant about the upcoming movie by Disney. However, I actually ended up watching it with my husband and my kids (6 & 7 years old) FIVE TIMES while it was playing at the movie theater. None of us got even close to boredom each time. And we have already got the 2-disc special collector's edition DVD. The important thing with Narnia from my point of view, is that it represents an entirely different sent of values than those praised for and enhanced in other success movies for kids  (such as, for example, the Harry Potter series). In the Harry Potter movies we find endless references to elements from the esoteric, magic and even witchcraft which is of course entertaining but from my point of view could also be negative for the young soul. Whereas in Narnia from the very beginning  a deep message can be foreseen that conveys a whole different set of values. Being essentially a theologian C.S. Lewis' intention of leaving a strong Christian message is fully achieved both in the books as well as in the movie, which I found great. Kids immediately connect with the Penvensie children and particularly (in my case) with Lucy Pevensie (remarkably portrayed by Georgie Henley). The movie comes across so visually attractive, with even great battle scenes and with such a powerful embedded message that it has undoubtedly already become a classic for kids and a delight for each and every member of the family.\n",
      "As a high-school teacher for English foundations (resource students), I choose one elementary-based book that is loaded with mythical characters and easy to understand scenes.  Because my students can be overloaded with standardized testing and a strict curriculum, I throw a little fun in the lesson to keep students engaged in their learning.  After a shortened version of a reading, I utilize movies as a visual aide supplement to help them connect with the characters, setting, dialogue... I strongly recommend using this dvd to support your curriculum to teach on all levels of student learning (auditory, kinesthetic, visual).  This movie follows the book completely.\n",
      "this movie is a very good movie. i didnt expect it to be as good as it was. some fans of the book would be a little disappointed because they had 2 cut alot of the book from the movie due 2 how long the movie needs 2 be. i still do think they good a  good job in that area. only bad part is  that it was kinda slow at times. but all the key moments were great. the battling in the end was epic and was awesome. all the creatures looked soo realistic. this movie is also is great because it is great for all ages. peace.\n",
      "This set is terrific. So many extras, enough to keep you interested for hours. The extended edition movie itself is great, not too long at all. The Bookends are well made and a great addition to my collectables collection. I highly recommend this item. I did not buy the original release of the DVD, I waited for this extended edition to be released.\n",
      "I found the movie version to be spectacular, wonderfully filmed, and the characters of Lucy and Edmund vey well played. Nothing can fault it technically as a film but I found that it didn't capture the essence of the book as C.S. Lewis wrote it. Back in the 1980's the BBC produced a television version of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, which does capture the book perfectly and is still available on DVD. My suggestion is that you first read the book then watch both productions on DVD and see if you agree with me.\n",
      "As a lifelong fan of the Chronicles of Narnia books, I was apprehensive about a film version.  After all, I've read the books countless times over and know them start to finish, and I wasn't sure about someone else interpreting them for me (I think that most of us lifelong Narnians tend to think of Narnia as 'our own personal world').  But I was satisfied with what happened.  I will admit, I was disappointed the first time I saw it.  But after seeing it again, I realized that it was because Andrew Adamson's vision of it was different from my own.  Once I accepted this, I began to really enjoy the film.  It is clear that Adamson is a fellow Narnian, and his love of the book comes through in his filmmaking.Visually, the film is beautiful, capturing the otherworldliness of the books.  Centaurs, Fauns, Dwarves, Minotaurs, and Talking Beasts all look absolutely real.  And the Great Lion is as majestic and awesome as I had hoped.  The acting was very solid as well, particularly from the four children.  I was amazed at the performances of both Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes (as Lucy and Edmund).  The only character that let me down a bit was the White Witch- I always pictured her as more regal, more intimidating, and more sinister.  Part of this, I think, were the very weird costumes she wore, because Tilda Swinton's performance was actually very good.  The bizarre dresses and dreadlocks kind of took away from that.For the most part, the film was true to the book.  There were a couple of scenes added which I thought enhanced the story, in particular the opening scene of the Blitz in London, and more scenes of the childrens' interaction before they entered Narnia.  The biggest change was probably the introduction of the Fox character, who is only briefly mentioned in the book.  However, I liked the Fox quite a bit.  Another highlight was the handling of Father Christmas, which could have been incredibly cheesy (I always thought that it seemed a little awkward even in the book).  But instead of yo-ho-ho, he was portrayed as a wise old warrior, and I was sorry to see him exit so quickly.I have read some critique about the Christian undertones in the film, but there's little to criticize.  The genius of C.S.Lewis's work is that he infused his faith into his fiction without being preachy or beating the reader over the head with it.  As a Christian myself, I was glad that Adamson did not attempt to gloss over or secularize the the themes that Lewis put into the work.  But they're really only there if you're looking for them.  I loved the books for years before I became a Christian, and was actually quite surprised to find that my favorite books had a Christian allegory woven so well into the story that I had never noticed it before.  Lewis always said that the story came first, and that allegory was never his intention.  Because of this, I think that non-Christians will not be offended or even necessarily take note of the spiritual themes, or may interpret them in another way.  As Lewis intended, its a great story, first and foremost.Now, all they have to do is make films of the other six...\n",
      "Yes, the movie was missing some of the best dialogue from the book, as the Harry Potter movies often thoroughly miss some of the most eloquent lines Rowling writes, but this movie was overwhelmingly faithful to the \"feel\" of the book.Obviously, there were strong Christian overtones, as with LOTR. The difference is that LOTR was symbolism (hence, Christ is Aragorn, Gandalf, _and_ Frodo) whereas Narnia is allegory, with a more direct 1:1 correlation.Some of the Christian symbolism was obvious: despite his ability to save himself and destroy the White Witch, Aslan sacrifices himself to save the undeserving traitor, Edmund. He is then raised from the dead, breathes life back into those dead because of the Witch (dead to sin), and kills the Witch, bringing life back to Narnia. He then departs with a promise to one day return.For those who are curious about further Christian symbolism:1. The movie ends with the four chasing a stag (even though they have no bows with which to shoot it). The stag is a traditional literary symbol of Christ, so of course here they are pursuing Christ. In the book, it is the White Stag, which is an unambiguous Christ symbol from the Middle Ages. (Medieval literature was Lewis' specialty, incidentally.)2. The Red Lion is another Christ symbol. Christ as a lion is a symbol derived from the Biblical Lion of Judah.3. The gryphons, not in the book, are added. The gryphon is part eagle (lord of the skies) and part lion (lord of the earth). Hence, the gryphon is Lord of Heaven and Earth. (Ring a bell?)4. The phoenix makes an appearance at the battle scene, lighting the fire which stops the armies of the Witch with a wall of fire (shades of Exodus, anyone?). And of course the phoenix is the Resurrection Bird.To the criticism of addressing an average Joe as \"your Majesty\" because it provokes pride, you may have Tom Paine on your side but you do not have the Bible, sir. God clearly promises that Christians will inherit the earth -- hence, our role as his children. (Did you think that meant inherit the title of serf?)And yes, Harry Potter is also Christian fiction. See LOOKING FOR GOD IN HARRY POTTER by John Granger.\n",
      "I love this movie.  I love all three that they have made so far!  Buy it.  It's clean, it's detailed, it's funny, and you'll love it.  Even your kids can watch these movies.  Buy them on DVD and you won't regret it.\n",
      "If you don't mind, I'm going to hop on one of my soapboxes for a minute and preach to you, concerning the original order of the books, and then I'll review the movie.C.S. Lewis MENT for the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe to be the 1st in this series. You can say whatever you want, but it's the truth. I've read all of them, and I am fully aware that the Magician's Nephew is set before TLTW&TW;, but nevertheless, TLTW&TW; was published first, and meant to be first. Look at it this way. Reading the Magician's Nephew first in the series (and then reading it in the new, absolutely perverse order it has been contorted into) is like knowing, when you watch the the original Star Wars movies for the first time, that Darth Vader is Luke's father. It takes away every ounce of mystery and suspense in the movie. Read it in the original order, I beg you. It's-1. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe2. Prince Caspian3. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader4. The Silver Chair5. The Horse and his Boy6. The Magician's Nephew7. The Last BattleALRIGHTY THEN! Now for the movie.Amazing. Stunning. Brilliant. Ingenious. Stupendous. Marvelous. Spectacular. Need I continue? It's without a doubt the best movie of 2005.The four Pevensie children do an AMAZING job at the acting, especially Georgie Henley (as Lucy), and William Moseley (as Peter), though I would never dream of undermining the obvious talent possessed in Anna Popplewell (as Susan), and Skandar Keynes (as Edmund). They all give a completely convincing performance, and it made me want to be in Narnia, to fight alongside Peter and Aslan, to cry with Susan and Lucy, and to be redeemed with Edmund. Rupert Everett does a great voice-over as the Fox, and the two beavers were hilarious. Though I didn't think the true splendor of Aslan was exposed as well in the movie as it is in the books, I thought Liam Neeson was a great choice for Aslan. Jim Broadbent (as Professo Kirk) also did a humurously good job at portraying his odd character. James McAvoy, an unknown, did an AMAZING job as Mr.Tumnus. He was just like the literary character, and I was blown away.The special effects, scenery, script, storyline, and everything else is wonderful as well.I plan on purchasing this movie the exact day it comes out, for sure. Go watch it, it's amazing.AND READ THE BOOKS IN THE CORRECT ORDER, OR ELSE THE MYSTERY IS RUINED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "This is just an all around decent family movie.Being part of a series, it gives you the option of enjoying the world all that much longer.I certainly recommend this movie if you are looking for something to watch with the family.\n",
      "It's good to see major studios take a chance on Christian themed films. And now that Disney is in production with a sequel. Bravo! I have never read \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" by C.S. Lewis, but my two son's have the complete set, and have enjoyed reading them. Very moving, and extremely well done. Good family and inspirational film making.\n",
      "Andrew Adamson's film adaptation of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe captures the spirit of C.S. Lewis' literary masterpiece.  Adamson (Shrek, Shrek 2), who directed, co-wrote and co-produced this film, has done a masterful job of bringing Lewis' remarkable book to the big screen.  TLTW&TW is the story of four British children who are shipped out of London during the German air raids over the city during World War II.  They are sent to stay in the home of an old professor.  While playing a game a hide-and-seek, Lucy Pevensie, the youngest child, disocvers and old wardrobe and hides inside and finds herself in the snowy forests of Narnia, a land that has been locked in perpetual winter for over a hundred years by the White Witch, the self-proclaimed Queen of Narnia.  When Lucy returns to the professor's mansion, her siblings so not believe her story.  However, when she visits Narnia a second time, her brother Edmund follows her through into the wintry land where he befriends the White Witch, who seduces the young lad with sweets (Turkish delight) and the promise of future power as King of Narnia if he will deliver his siblings to her.  Soon all four of the Pevensie children journey through the wardrobe into Narnia where they find the Witch seeks to kill them, as their coming is part of a prophecy which is to result in her downfall.  Edmund runs off to join the Witch and betrays his siblings, but finds himself imprisoned.  Peter, Susan and Lucy join forces with the lion Aslan and his troops to free their brother.  Much has been said about Narnia and its Christian themes and allegories, but this is a story that can be enjoyed by Christians and non-Christians alike.  And the allegories are not heavy-handed at all.  The viewer is not being beaten over the head and preached to or told what to believe.  This movie is well-written and directed.  Liam Neeson gives a great vocal performance as Aslan.  He is just right for this role.  Tilda Swinton has, perhaps, the best performance as the White Witch.  The child actors who portray the Pevensies are all delightful, especially Georgie Henley as Lucy.  The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is one of the best films I've seen over the last few years.  I'm also very pleased that Adamson is returning to direct the next Narnia film, Prince Caspian, due out Christmas 2007.  I'm already eager to see the second film.\n",
      "My fear when I first heard that a series of films based on C. S. Lewis's marvelous CHRONICLES OF NARNIA books I was simultaneously fearful and hopeful.  I was afraid, on the one hand, that they would somehow mangle the books in translating them to the screen; I was hopeful, on the other hand, that perhaps the filmmakers would do for Lewis what Peter Jackson had done for Lewis's friend J. R. R. Tolkein and his LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy.  Neither my hopes nor my fears were realized, for while this is in no way a bad movie, it doesn't come up to the level of the LOTR.This is quite a good film, and that in itself is something of an achievement.  In rereading a couple of Lewis's Narnia books lately, I've increasingly wondered if it is possible to do a great--as opposed to merely a very good--translation of these books into film.  The problem is twofold.  First, the books are quite literary in a way that Tolkein's books are not.  So much of the substance of the book consists of the manner in which Lewis addresses the reader and the filmmakers either did not try or did not succeed in finding an analog to this in the film.  On the other hand, this same manner of addressing the reader actually pads out the book, creating far more pages than a more succinct treatment of the subject would have done.  This is not a fault of the novel; far from it.  But it does leave the filmmaker with a problem with a lack of action.  Thus, anyone making a film is forced to think of ways to pad out the action.  This is the opposite problem with most adaptations of a literary source.  Usually you have too little time to squeeze in too much content.  Here there is too much time to contain the content that the novel provides.  Hence, the result is a heavily embellishment of the book.  One finds more in the movie than one finds in the book, and I'm not entirely certain that this is a good thing.  The upside is that not much that was added was bad.If the film just missed that last extra bit of magic that would have made it a masterpiece, it did manage to be at least excellent in almost every area.  They made a great decision at the outset, opting to following the \"real\" order of the books, instead of the wretched reordering brought about by Lewis's stepson and literary executor Douglas Gresham (who gets co-producer credit in the film, almost certainly an honorary designation, since his insistence on reordering the books shows he really doesn't understand them).  Think of how awful it would have been if the film series had started with the weakest novel in the series, THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW, instead of THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, which is the finest (though perhaps not the one most suited to translation to film--more of this below).  The music was excellent, the sets were superb, the CGI consistently excellent, the art direction marvelous.  Though the cast featured virtually no name performers, I found no problems in the casting.  I very much liked the kids in the film, especially Georgie Henley as Lucy, which is probably the most important of the four children's roles to get right.  Tilda Swinton, one of the great film actresses of the past decade, was excellent as the witch; though I thought her costuming was a bit below par.  The fake shoulders they gave her at times looked quite absurd.  Liam Neeson was a good choice to voice Aslan, though I admit that I regret Brian Cox's having dropped out of the project.  I am not aware what issues were in play in causing him to leave, but I think his extremely gruff voice would have been wonderfully appropriate for Aslan, who is not, of course, a tame lion.  The CGI for Aslan was very good and I wasn't the tiniest bit disappointed with Aslan's appearance.  Since he is the only character who will appear in every film, it was essential to get him right.  Aslan is not, as many suppose, a Christ figure.  Instead, Lewis meant him actually to be Christ as he might have been incarnated as a mighty lion in a magical land called Narnia.  To the filmmakers' credit, they did not mute the religious message at the heart of the books, but neither did they highlight it more than Lewis himself did.  I think they struck the right balance.There is a very real chance that some of the other books in the series will be more successful as films than this one.  THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER, for instance, has considerable possibility as a movie, including what is quite probably the finest single character in the series apart from Aslan.  I speak, of course, of the swashbuckling mouse Reepicheep.  Even THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW, which is a fairly weak book, has considerable potential as a film.  And if they get THE LAST BATTLE, Lewis's non-premillenial rendering of the end of the world, right, it could end up one of the great film fantasies ever created.  I no longer fear that they will do a disservice to Lewis's books in these films, but I will continue to hope that they create something magical.\n",
      "NOTE: The comments which follow are on the special two-disc Collector's Edition, available with subtitles in English, Spanish, and French.The film is based on and seems remarkably faithful to the C.S. Lewis classic, the second in a series of seven novels. Here's the basic situation. Four siblings are relocated from their London home to a country estate to be with an eccentric uncle, Professor Kirke,  during the \"Blitz.\" While playing a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy hides in a wardrobe and -- like Alice and Dorothy -- unexpectedly finds herself in a magical world. Later joined by her two brothers and sister, Lucy and they become involved in a conflict between what my grandson Cameron calls \"the good guys\" (led by a lion king named Aslan) and \"the bad guys\" (led by a witch named Jadis) at a time when a  curse (Jadis') has confined Narnia to perpetual winter but without Christmas. There is one way to break her curse -- best revealed within the narrative -- and eventually that happens but not until after a series of adventures which are always entertaining but never threatening to young sensibilities.As did Alice and Dorothy, Lucy and her companions encounter all manner of strange creatures (both allies and foes) which include hags, soldiers, a German pilot, Rumblebuffin the Giant, red and black dwarves, centaurs, satyrs, wolves, Philip the Horse, fauns, centaur archers, and gryphons. Eventually, after a spectacular battle, Jadis is defeated and the curse is ended. The special effects are stunning and I especially appreciate anthropomorphism which is never \"cute.\" The actors who portray the four Pevensie children, especially Georgie Henley as Lucy, are exceptionally talented.  Cloying I can always do without.I think it would be a mistake to force comparisons and contrasts between this film and any of the Potter and Ring films. There are similarities and differences, to be sure, but none which seems to me to be especially significant. I thoroughly enjoyed this film because plot, acting, imagery, and musical score are so brilliantly integrated in the service of effective storytelling. Others may find -- and either admire or object to -- what they perceive to be the film's presentation of Lewis' Christian beliefs. What seems much more relevant to me is the emphasis on values common to all of the world's great religions and, indeed, to codes of ethics which are wholly secular. Faith, for example, as well as love, courage, devotion, loyalty, self-sacrifice, and trust. These values are affirmed but only by implication. Hence young Cameron's immediate grasp of what is \"good\" and \"bad\" in character and behavior.The production values are superb, the conflicts and their resolution are plausible, and the film's running of time of 134 minutes seems just right. This is a film which offers a great deal to viewers of all ages. As  my rating correctly indicates, I highly recommend it.The additional features provided in the two-disc Collector's Edition really are \"special\" and include a commentary in which Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, and director Andrew Adamson participate; a production commentary by director Andrew Adamson, production designer Roger Ford and producer Mark Johnson; \"bloopers\"; Narnia \"fun facts\"; several featurettes such as an in-depth look at cinematic storytellers, director's diary and the children's magical journey; also \"Chronicle of a Director,\" \"The Children's Magical Journey,\" and \"Anatomy of a Scene: the Melting River.\" It takes about ten hours to view the two discs to completion. My guess (only a guess) is that most people will also view only those special features of greatest interest to them. My grandchildren (ranging in age from five to fourteen) seem to prefer watching only the film and do so again and again.\n",
      "Then the BBC Version, because back then when the movie was made theydid not have the special effects we have now days, the effects were corneythe acting was bad and well it was nothing like todays version, in fact you could clearly see it was people dressed up as beavers, fawns, and cheaply done animations.  I give this movie*4* stars because its never going to be a cult classic like a lot of other movies!\n",
      "Chilling words from one of my favorite witches from Disney. Boy, she is so, so. . . coldhearted, and she is not afraid to show it!The magical sets, awesome musical backgrounds, dramatic and charming acting from the children, as well as CGI cast, all make a harmonious blend of a children's movie that's good enough for adults, and cult lovers of original storybook.I don't have any complaints, and don't mind the brief extras, mainly outtakes and bloopers. The movie is well crafted and totally endearing to watch. Disney really needs to concentrate on making more movies like this one, as well as Pirates Of The Caribbean. I miss the old days when Disney meant good comedy, drama, high spirit adventure, and musicals. Not just animation, and Pixar! The other releases, through affiliates with Touchstone Pictures, doesn't all together do it for me. Back in the real hey days it was \"Walt Disney presents. . .\" That's the way it should be, and that's the way Chronicles Of Narnia is basically marketed.\n",
      "Watched with my family on movie night.  It was enjoyed by the adults as well as the kids.  The story led to some good discussion afterwards. Looking forward to the next movie in the series for our next movie night.\n",
      "We got this for our kids and they loved the movie.  More to our surprise, my husband and I loved the movie as well.  Great good vs. evil!\n",
      "This movie was absolutely everything that I wanted it to turn out to be. I highly recommend this to anyone and not just because it's a disney movie. It also has great acting, a perfect plot and awesome characters. Especially Aslan the lion {Liam Neeson}. I also think every character was pretty well cast, like the White Witch {Tilda Swinton}, and the wardrobe is where the magic begins with beautiful scenery of Narnia and monster members of the White Witch's army, {that goes without saying} with more than a few great battle scenes that makes everything fit everything perfectly in Narnia as the way it is, like making the entire movie a cross between Indiana Jones and \"Lord of The Rings.\" I remember seeing several different versions of \"Narnia\" before this movie with the BBC version and the books, neither that I remember that well, but the point is this is just another wonderful adaption that was even better than I anticipated because I didn't know what to think before I saw it and now all I can think of is how marvelous it really is.\n",
      "Several times in this volume of Narnia Lewis has this statement.  It speaks directly to his writing these chronicles for children: to reintroduce many of them to the world of fantasy.  Thus, his criticism of the educational system of his time which played down the fantasy world in favor of the pure intellectual, scientific one.This is not the usual fantasy however, but one informed by a true connoisseur of fine fantasy literature from his academic life and one also informed from his Christian faith.  Hence the strong symbolism running throughout.  The storyline is powerful with the viewers transformed into another world of Narnia, where the clash between good and evil is dramatically presented e.g. where it is always winter but no Christmas celebration.Children of all times will enjoy this magnificently produced and filmed version.  The casting is magnificent, with these English children and their accents and manners sharp contrast to ours in America today.  This reviewer also finds the casting of the White Witch very well done, as she seems so attractive and yet deceptive from the outset.  Perfect!For those who haven't read this to their children, see it then obtain the book and read it to and with them.  As is typically the case, the book tops even this beautiful film version with good soundtrack.Hoping Disney follows through with remainder of Narnia.\n",
      "Great story of a far away place in another dimension with time warp factor.Great scenery and great acting. Fell in love with Lucy Pevensie. A most see for everyone af all ages. Can't wait to see Prince Caspian, 1300 years later.\n",
      "El trabajo hecho con esta pelicula es espectacular, no solo por lo increiblemente real de los personajes no-humanos, sino tambien por el esfuerzo puesto en la escenografia, efectos especiales, maquillaje y demas aspectos que dan vida a esta magistral obra.La actuacion de los chicos es bastante profesional, y la escena de guerra epica es impactante por el realismo puesto, aunque la violencia esta muy bien controlada para evitar que el film sea solo para personas adultas.Definitivamente una pelicula de lujo muy recomendable para toda la familia.\n",
      "We are fans of the 2 first movies. It is a very good option to have at home. We all love it.\n",
      "I like this movie. It features special deleted scenes. It's loads of fun. My whole family enjoyed it and we are going to wait for the other 2 movies to be released also in the extended version.\n",
      "All the Narnia books are great. This one should be read or watched first. Gives the best introduction to the series. Lucy is my favorite.\n",
      "Great product. Brand new item at a great price! I would highly recommend this deal to anyone! A great purchase!\n",
      "Well, it has been a few decades since I last read the Narnia chronicles.  Would I remember any of the details?  Surprisingly, yes!  The movie was true to the book's plot, and the actors were well matched with the characters.  I could almost taste the Turkish Delight as it dripped down Edmund's chin!I look forward to watching it again just to marvel at the detail in the animals.  I want this book to be titled, \"The lion, the wolves, and the beaver,\" because these \"characters\" were so interesting!  Watch how the wind blows on Aslan's fur, and compare the lions in this film, in \"The Lion King,\" and in a nature documentary.  Unbelievable! And the Queen's gaze was soooo penetrating!  Try it during your next job evaluation and see what happens!One disappointment:  Peter really wasn't very good with his sword.  He is an untrained kid, after all!  But his opponents practically threw themselves on his sword, which was always shiny and clean.  If something magical happened (it is a land of magic), then he should be a good fighter.  If he really was a bumbling learner, then maybe some bumbling mistakes?That was a minor complaint.  This was an entertaining film for kids and adults that makes me want to read the book again.  Now when does the next Narnia film come out...?\n",
      "This was a well done film. The characters are believable and the computer graphics \"flawless.\"If you're a \"modern\" fan of C.S. Lewis you'll love the way the characters come to life, and you'll be pulled into their lives with great emotion. (I say \"modern\" for lack of a better term - intending to mean that faithfulness is important to you, but you're willing to accept some changes to the story as long as it doesn't really change the meaning.)This film, and the others in the series (Prince Caspian, Voyage of the Dawn Treader) - following the books - give the opportunity to think more deeply about Providence (God's involvement in the world) and Atonement (the offering of Jesus Christ for the sins of the world - I John 2:1-2 & John 1:29, 10:17-18).I highly recommend this film (and the Narnia books) for both pleasure and thinking.\n",
      "Just got back from seeing the Narnia movie: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.YES.This is the nearest thing to a perfect adaptation that has ever been done, as far as I can remember.From the opening with the London Blitz -- giving us a graphic explanation for those too young to understand why these children were sent away from their parents to some stranger's home -- to the final return to the real world, this is a demonstration that it is unquestionably possible to take a book and turn it into an adaptation which loses virtually nothing from the original and brings that original to life. There are so many brilliant and touching points in this film that I won't even attempt to talk about them all. I'll just hit the high points.ASLAN: The prime mover behind all events, Aslan is the image on which the movie will stand or fall. And it stands, and roars triumphantly to shake the theatre and say \"I HAVE COME!\". He is not a Tame Lion. He is THE Lion, the Lion any reader of Narnia has known, whether he was Christian to begin with or, like me, never noticed the Christian imagery until someone else pointed it out.JADIS, the WHITE WITCH: PERFECT. It was startling, amazing, and somewhat disquieting to see how they managed to make her both beautiful and repellent, a woman who was lovely and yet had... SOMETHING wrong with her. And how they didn't pull a single punch. She is as devastating as winter gone berserk, a moving, lethal, gorgeous ballet of destruction.The Four Children: Stunning. Lucy is brilliantly played, and so are the others -- Edward's pettiness and the price he pays for it, Peter's almost impossible transformation from British schoolboy to young king on the battlefield, Susan's thoughtfulness crossed with overcaution... Just lovely.NARNIA: I'd spend too long babbling to even make sense. Perfect.I haven't walked out of a theater so uplifted since, well, maybe seeing Star Wars for the first few times.If you have the slightest touch of a sense of wonder in you, go see this film. No, don't wait. Do it right now.Hear the Lion Roar in the theatre. It's worth admission. It's even worth enduring the inane \"The Twenty\".\n",
      "very few films have a power to influence and change the life of people with their MORALITY and NOBLE THEMES and the chronicles of narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe has that power.narnia series of books were one of the greatest fantasy series of books by c.s. lewis a close friend of j.r. tolkien who created lord of the rings series of books while tolkien's lord of the rings relied more on 'magical themes' narnia relies more on 'spritual christian themes'.the creation of narnia and it's magical creatures likefauns,centaurs,goblins and talking animals was as difficult as creating middle earth in lord of the rings but andrew adamson with his creative team had done the job with almost perfection and special effects were'AMAZINGLY BRILLIANT'.adapted to film by legendary director andrew adamson filmmaker of shrek series of films,narnia series of films TRACKS THE LONG FORGOTTEN VIRTUES OF COMPASSION,FORGIVENESS AND SACRIFICE.while lord of the rings series of films are equaly popular but they LACK THE INNOCENCE AND PURITY WHICH UNIQUELY NARNIA HAS.the unforgettable characters like beavers,.mr. tumnus ,pevensies siblings and aslan the noble lion just immerse directly in your heart and merge with your emotions and become part of your life.narnia is undoubtedly one of the GREATEST FANTASY EPICS EVER MADE.marvellous cinematography and scenic landscapes of new zealand and amazing special effects and great non-voilent battle scenes and CHRISTIAN THEMES OF FORGIVENESS ,NOBLENESS , SACRIFICE AND COMPASSION MAKES THIS FILM A MUST WATCH LESSON FOR MORALITY IN OUR SOCIETY WHERE VOILENCE AND CHAOS DOMINATES EVEN IN SCHOOLS(so many school shootout incidents).what makes this film truly UNIQUE IS it's lessons of noble christian values enveloped with noble jesus like figure ASLAN and other loveble chararcters like mr.tumnus,beavers,lucy and brave peter and orius,which appeal to all ages especially children and help them to become better and noble human being in life.i suggest that chronicles of narnia should be screened in every school so that children should get inspired from it.me and my family are a GREAT FAN OF NARNIA ,WATCH THIS EPIC AND YOU WILL BECOME ONE TOO.\n",
      "Another \"i'd like to..\" review, i'm afraid.  It's a [nearly] faithful retelling -- there's a \"This is war!\" start, rather unneeded.  & the roles are nicely cast.But.  Its been 'disneyfied'.  O, the Witch is bad, but not *Evil*, nor is Aslan [sorry, Charlie] Christ.  The battler scenes use WETA technology, but there's no *heart* to them: no blood, no death, no beliveability.  It's Trilogy lite.  It couldn't have been done before ... but i can now understand why Lewis *didn't* want it done, esp. not by Disney.  They just don't 'get' it.& yes, i'm a pagan, who found the whole concept of Gaia-as-White-Witch -- hello?  Nature deity here! Spring, yes, Summer maybe, but Winter?!! -- dumb beyond belief.\n",
      "Wonderful books and movie!  It stays extremely close to the book.  They did a great job on creating Narnia as CS Lewis describes in his books.\n",
      "We got this movie so our grandchildren could watch it and we fell in love with it all over again. A splendid movie with many timeless lessons in it. Our grandchildren begged us to rent the rest of the Chronicles movies after seeing this one.\n",
      "I wasn't sure if I was going to like this movie but I really enjoyed it\n",
      "This is one of my all time favorite movies. I am so glad that Amazon has it again for viewing and purchasing. The  SD video quality is exceptional on the HDX.\n",
      "The idea of advertising this as having \"extra scenes\" is a bit ludicrous as the extra film footage mostly consisted of extended battle scenes and extensions on a few other scenes.  These extensions disrupted the smooth flow of the movie a small bit but not enough that your average movie-goer would notice.  The behind-the-scenes footage was fascinating although, it did tend to repeat bits from one segment to another.  In general I would say, if you only want one copy of the movie buy this one but unless you are a buff seeking to fill out your production knowledge of this film, the special edition is not worth hunting down.  (That said, I will probably be holding out for the special edition on the sequels.)\n",
      "Loved this movie. CS Lewis is a great author. The movie is inspiring and fun for the whole family. Can't wait to watch the others.\n",
      "Lion Witch and the Wardrobe is a wonderful movie. One of CS Lewis greatest writings. Amazon.com make it so easy to access and the picture was great!!  Thank you so very much..\n",
      "Perfect for it's genre, can't wait for all the Chronicles to be made, these will only get better and stronger with each movie!\n",
      "The movie got to me in a very timely manor.  It was exactly as the seller described.\n",
      "I grew up on the Chronicles of Narnia books, and was fairly excited to hear that a big-budget movie adaptation was being made. I found that it wasn't terribly disappointing either. The child actors they chose for the pivotal roles did a fine job, and Liam Neeson provides an excellent voice to Aslan. The HD version is very well shot and looks amazing. If you have children, they won't be able to help loving this movie.\n",
      "i did not know how many time i been watch this movie but i still love it that why i would like to have all the time where ever i go.\n",
      "I saw \"Chronicles of Narnia\" in the theater and thought it a grand old adaptation.  Yes, there were tweaks and changes, but, and this is hard for me to say as a reader as well as a film buff, one has to give up purity when you're taking a story from one media and adapting it to the strengths of another.  Also, when a trait from the story is hyped to the point of hysteria (namely references to Christendom), the end product can make a person scratch their heads in wonder what all the fuss was about.  In short, just like \"The Lord of the Ring,\" it's a miracle if the movie adaptation actually lives up to both the press and its source material.Live up to it it did.  Disney's co-production is a splendor to behold.  Excellent storytelling, fabulous cinematography, talented casting, and marvellous special effects team up to do the necessary job in bringing this great book to life.  Not an easy thing, especially when you see the BBC television adaptation and the good job THEY did with less than a tenth of this budget.  Purists (I am one) will pick at this or that.  Christian entertainment observers will harp on one lack of Christ-mentioning or another.  No matter - this is THE version of the book that will last forever (even though I hope the BBC's magnificent series will rate up there with it).Now, we get to my pet peeve - extended editions with every film.As a filmie, I say the more stuff, the better.  I love to see the details of a movie's creation.  Moreso when I adore the movie.  The two-disc original release did a good (not great) job covering how the movie was made which hinted rather darkly that Disney was going to follow \"The Lord of the Rings\" in this troubling new trend of putting out a new \"director's extended version\" every time there is yet another scrap of new footage found and used as a retooling excuse.  Hence, this.  I bought it (like a cheap hooker, I criticize the trend while engaging in propagating it) and liked the new stuff included in the battle sequences, but it beggers the question; did we NEED a whole new release for it?  I enjoyed the movie euqally without it, and while Disney made a value-added addition of extra making-of and historical materials, I can't seem to justify this extra spending.  Even WITH the rebate offer!Soooo...if you haven't bought it, buy this version, even with the differences, it's still the same great movie.  If you have it already, well, the decision is yours.  I certainly wouldn't have if it didn't give us all this extras goodness, and still feel somewhat....used...now that I bought into the temptation.\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia: the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.Four children with just their mother in an English town, dodging Nazi bombs, are being sent out to the country for their own safety.  The director starts the movie strong with bombs bursting in air, with one of the kids (Edmond) saving a picture of his father as the bombs are dropping.Their eldest brother Peter takes being the oldest seriously but he is very harsh on his brother Ed as are his two sisters.  Susan is the serious, brainy one.  And little Lucy is the brightest one.With this tense family backdrop, I could relate.  One brother wanting to lead but not willing to take control; a brainy, serious sister lacking imagination; a willful, argumentative brother who takes personal advantage of things despite its consequences; and little Lucy, who is bright with imagination and energy in the face of losing her mother and all four moving in with \"The Professor.\"The bombing scene was a bit fake to me, all CGI.  And the relation with the father is not totally explained.  The family situation with the professor and who he is was unsatisfactorily explained to the viewer (me) as well.  So the beginning gets off the a stuttered start.During a game of hide & seek as they are bored to death in a large house where they're not allowed to run or play (i.e., be kids), Lucy runs into a large wardrobe and off we go.The story moves at a steady pace, has the typical, light Disney magic.  It also has its dark side: betrayal, death, greed, and the use of power to further their own ends.The White Witch is an interesting sort.  Not sure how she became the queen or why winter fell upon Narnia.  Or even why Christmas had not been celebrated there for 100 years.  She brought new meaning to the term \"ice princess\" in my eyes!The film is visually stunning.  The mountains, the griffins and satyrs, the mermaids and lofty towers of castles.  And the dark & stark white prisons, Aslan's death by assassination -- these are all pretty strong for children and thus the PG rating.Too much is not explained to my satisfaction at the start, more of a background history of some of the characters, why they're acting as they are, what their relationships are, are skimmed over.However, the great acting by Georgie Henley, William Moseley, Skandar Keynes and Anna Popplewell as the four English children (my, those accents!) lift the movie to be more than the sum of its parts.Recommended, not only for an exploration into the mind of C.S. Lewis and his brand of fantasy novels but also for the exploration of family and friend relationships, honor and majesty.The DVD is cool as well with fascinating facts (JRR Tolkien & C.S. Lewis were contemporaries and often checked each others' work), some bloopers, and two sets of commentaries by the stars and by the director.  It was also fun to see that Industrial Light and Magic in the San Francisco area had a part in the production of this film.  To see the credits, New Zealand, England, Czech Republic, man these guys have been all over!  But I digress.I well-made piece of entertainment.Can't wait to explore the next film, Prince Caspian, as well as a heightened interest in C.S. Lewis' novels.Films!:The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (Three-Disc Collector's Edition+ Digital Copy and BD Live) [Blu-ray]The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Widescreen Edition)Books!:The Chronicles of Narnia (7-Book Box Set includes \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,\" \"Prince Caspian,\" \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,\" \"The Silver Chair,\" \"The Magician's Nephew,\" \" The Horse and His Boy\" and \"The Last Battle\")Radio Theater of Narnia:The Chronicles of Narnia: Never Has the Magic Been So Real (Radio Theatre) [Full Cast Drama]The BBC Version:The Chronicles of Narnia 3 Pack DVD Set - BBC VersionOther C.S.

      "As a big fan of CS Lewis since I was a kid, it has been fun to read these stories again with my kids. The movie was a good adaptation of the first book in this series. A little scary at times for smaller children, but my 7 year old loved it. Most importantly, the true message of the story really comes through. I was pleasantly surprised that they didn't water that part down at all. Lost one star in my opinion because they were a little too over the top in the scary scenes and didn't keep in mind the little ones that would be watching this. But otherwise a great family movie for kids over ~6 years old who have already read the book and will understand the context and meaning of the characters depicted.\n",
      "This classic, beloved C.S. Lewis novel comes to life on the big screen. Unlike with most movies this follows the book seamlessly. A wonderfully directed classic fully alive with breath taking effects and plenty of action. This movie is a perfect complimentary addition to the classic novel I recommend it for children and adults alike\n",
      "This movie is simply fantastic, having not read the Book I felt it was complete and very well done (much better then any Harry Potter or Lord of the Ring Movies).  I now plan on reading the book and enjoying the FULL Narnia adventure.Four siblings stumble into a fantasy world through a wardrobe cabinet where; A Evil Witch, A Good Lion, Santa Clause and talking animals inhabit.  One child is taken by the Witch, while the other three journey through the land to find the great Lion.  Joining forces with the Lion and his troupe, they battle the Evil Witch and her army.  ReUnited the child live carefree as royalty for many years until they come across familar ground and find the wardrobe cabinet making their way back into their world (back as the childern they were when they entered).I'm sure much like Lord of the Rings, much has to be removed to keep the movie in a managable time frame, but unlike the ending to the LOTR trilogy they did seem to finish Narnia very well.In LOTR the hobbits return to the shire to find the evil wizard and they defeat him - this is SUCH a important piece of the story *showing the strength and courage of friends* and is left out - by the director).If you enjoy the Wizard of Oz - I would highly recommend Narnia as a must have for anyone's collection.  An instant Family Classic, one to be enjoyed over and over again.\n",
      "I really like this movie.This movie arrived very fast.The movie wasn't damaged either.The movie plays great too.\n",
      "This is a great edition of the Chronicles of Narnia.  It is very well done.  I recommend it to anyone who loves Narnia.\n",
      "This is excellent for those of us who have not read the books.  There is beautiful aristry in this production and there are the wonderful characters that make this such a suberb, balanced film.  Good for all ages.  For those who like entertainment that the whole family can enjoy, this is for you\n",
      "Being a long-time fan of the beloved Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis I was fearful of getting my hopes up too high with this big-budget motion picture of \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" but was ultimately pleased with how well it turned out and am not the least bit disappointed.From the wintery wonderland to the budding of Spring, director Andrew Adamson, on his first live-action project, brought Narnia to life better than I ever could have envisioned it with enchanting sets, stunning cinematography and a magical yet subtle score; meeting my every expectation.There of course were some understandable changes made to help the length and flow of the movie, as well as to add a bit more suspense to the already wonderful storyline, but all the important details remained, staying pretty much true to the book. I even felt that the film improved upon it because, as is the case in most children's, or even young adult books for that matter, there's never enough plot or character development (C.S. Lewis, respectively, left much to the imagination), but here they do.The CGI is admittedly noticeable in spots (the fox, for instance, didn't look very real to me) but they obviously took great care to detail on Aslan and it definitely shows! They also chose a wonderful cast--my favorite performances being Mr. Tumnus the faun, Jadis the White Witch, and the Pevensie children (albeit some of Lucy's crying did sound a little forced)--and I'm personally grateful they chose relatively unknown actors.As a side note, I'm greatly annoyed with all these comparisons to the Lord Of The Ring's and Harry Potter. In my eyes the only thing they each have in common is the fact that they all fall under the fantasy genre. Otherwise they're completely different films. And you honestly don't have to be religious to enjoy this movie. I myself am an athiest and relished every moment of this film... Interpret it whichever way you'd like for that was how it was intended to be viewed by the author himself! Also, there's only one epic battle scene and it contains no blood [hence the PG rating], so if violence is all you look for in a movie, this isn't for you! It's simply good old-fashioned storytelling that's destined to become a classic like the book.\n",
      "This series is masterfully done. The acting and CG effects are wonderful and you often forget that 99% of this is CG its done so well.\n",
      "This movie is a wonderful realization of the C.S. Lewis book. I loved The Chronicle of Narnia books as a kid and it's great to see them made into movies. The casting of Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are perfect. The White Witch and Aslan (with Liam Neeson's kingly voice) are also wonderful and James McAvoy is brilliant. The look and sound of the film gives me that same wonderfully magical feeling I had as a kid reading these books. I hope they make a movie of every one of the seven books, that would be great!!!\n",
      "The young actors were wonderful, played their parts well.  I loved the different kinds of human/animal (man/horse) portraid in this movie.  The talking animals were precious.  I consider any movie without any bad language exceptional.\n",
      "Disney's adaptation of the C.S. Lewis classic does a comendable job bring the world of Narnia to life. The special effects laden world gets the flavor of the books just right and really made me feel transported to that magical world on the other side of the wardrobe.While the film isn't a literal translation of the novel (I think it wouldn't have worked if it had been) it is more than that.  I really feel this film is able to stand on it's own and is worth the price of the DVD.The film tells the story of four children from London who are sent into the English countryside during the bombing of World War II (something which was quite common during the war was to send children into the countryside).  It is at the house in which they are staying where they discover the magical wardrobe which transports them to the land of Narnia.  In Narnia they become involved in the politics/war of the White Witch against Aslan.While the story is certainly a Christian allegory, the director handles it in such a way at to not knock you over the head with it.  He does a great job of not allowing the story to bog down (which can happen when adapting a novel to film).  The acting is good as is the cinematography and special effects.One thing I am tired of seeing/hearing is the comparision to the Harry Potter series.  To do so does a diservice not only to the Naria film, but to C.S. Lewis, a devout Christian.  I don't think you could say the same for the creator of Harry Potter, and comparing the two is truly like comparing apples to oranges.This film, while not great on the same epic scale of the Lord of the Rings (a much more apt film to compare it to), it wasn't meant to be the epic which the LOTR was.  This film is a good one and I highly recommend it.\n",
      "It is my understanding that this movie was created with God and the Bible in mind. I believe it, and can see the parallelisms.\n",
      "You may have seen the edited version of this on TV. At a glance you will think it just for kids....think again. Actually this is the start of  (at least) a trilogy that gets more exciting as you go.Sit back and enjoy a departure from lifes problems, and think about investing in part II and III.\n",
      "While the movie moved just a little slowly in a couple of places, it was overall very enjoyable.  The animation was done really well.  You can certainly tell that the movie hit the highlights of the story in places and did not go into details from the book.\n",
      "This movie is one of the best fantasy family epics that I have ever seen!All of the characters are intersting. But most of all, the child actors are convincing in their roles. Good directing and an excellent storyline earn this soon to be classic a 5 star rating. Enjoy!!\n",
      "Even though it doesn't do justice to the children's book it's still very entertaining and the visual effects are great. Regardless of the bad publicity C.S. Lewis got it is the telling of the story as the animals see it. Aslan is the image of Jesus Christ who must sacrifice his own life to save the prophecy and Narnia from the evil of the White Witch.The children were delightful especially Georgie Henley who played the role of Lucy. There are many references in the film regarding to Biblical theology and the way C.S. Lewis wrote the story through the imaginary interpetation of the four Pevensie children, Lucy, Peter, Edmund, and Susan, the animals suffering under a hundred year bondage, Aslan the Messiah (Christ), and the evil White Witch (Satan).There is a word of caution to parents before letting children views certain scenes like the White Witch's castle, the sacrifice of Aslan (scary looking creatures), and the battle coulde be a little to much for very young children. But I've seen worse in others. Other than that I enjoyed the storyline and that all things came to a good ending when Narnia is restored to it rightful glory of freedom and peace in the land. I recommend this to those who like something a little different that tells it in a theological view, fantastic mythical beasts, talking animals, and great visual effects.\n",
      "Where shall I begin? Narnia blew me away, folks. This movie has it all; Excellent acting, story line, special effects, action and it is wholesome enough for little kids.ACTING-I don't see this often in a movie, but every actor in this movie did a superb job. Best in show would have to be a tie between the little girl who played Lucy and the woman who played the witch. Every facial expression and every line spoken was perfect. When the white witch was trying to seem nice, you felt that she was sweet. When she wasn't seeming so nice, you felt the villany in her heart. Lucy portrayed both the innocence and the naivity of a small child.STORY LINE-The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe has long been considered a literary classic, loved the world over because it is a suberbly written story about a group of four children who partake in an amazing adventure in the magical world of Narnia. In this world, every animal speaks and magic is everywhere. The world is in the icy grip of an all-powerful evil witch, and it is up to the children to set things right. The use of children as the main characters instantly captivates the imagination of every child watching, as they imagine themselves taking part in the adventure.SPECIAL EFFECTS-Due to fantastic advances in computer animation, the epic battles which take place in this movie are nothing short of amazing. Huge armies of monsters, including minotaurs, centaurs, satyrs, giants, gnomes, flying griffons and many types of animals clash in amazingly detailed environments. The sounds of battle fill the theatre, making the viewer feel as if they are right there.ACTION-This is an action packed movie. Better skip the large drink on this one, as you will not want to miss a minute of it going to the restroom. There is never a dull moment in Narnia.\n",
      "I just finished reading the book with my daughter. We love that the movie closely follows the book. She was spellbound.\n",
      "This is one of the better blu rays out there. The picture quality is fantastic. Also, it is one of my new favorite movies. Highly recommended!\n",
      "With all the hype, I was a little queasy about this film, for fear they would ruin the storyline, but Nay. The characters were great (the Professor didn't look quite as I had pictured him), but everthing, and everyone was better than I expected.C. S. Lewis didn't spend a lot of time visually creating the landscape of Narnia, so its was great to see it as I had pictured Narnia myself. Lewis instead, painted with words, some very believeable characters, and when I read this as a child, I could see Narnia through the eyes of the Pevensie children. Just as I shadowed Nancy Drew in her detective work.The casting was great, and if as a child, I had picked a part for me, it would have to be Lucy: tender, innocent, and full of trust and love, this all comes through her beautifully.I really enjoyed the character of Father Christmas, and even though his bag was full of things, including a very charming teddybear, the gifts chosen for Peter, Susan and Lucy (Edmund missed out, by not being there), he stressed the gifts were tools, not toys. He was the ray of hope in an otherwise very dismal prospect. It's also intersting how Father Christmas and Aslan can be presented in the same movie. There is room for both at Christmastime: Hope, Love and Faith. What's really important, the idea is in no way conflicting: its just as a child would see it.Liam Neeson's voice was firm, but gentle and very well played. This is a credit to an actor who is playing not only The King of Beasts, but also the Son of God. I never did imagine the face of Mr. Neeson, standing by a microphone, and reading the lines, while watching Aslan speak. The blending of voice and strength was inseparable.Watching the scenes, I did miss the humorous narrative provided in the book, as if C. S. Lews was speaking parenthetically, or asides. I even watched for it when Lucy slightly closed the Wardrobe door, and in my head, I could hear the words he has written about for Lucy as she steps in among the fur coats: \"...leaving the door open, of course, because she knew it was very foolish to shut oneself into any wardrobe\". In the book, it's not like Lucy is really the one who is thinking but the 'person who is telling the story to us'.Absolutley, highly recommended. If you like battle scenes, and creatures, and special effects, you won't be disappointed. However, in keeping with the upbeat theme of the story, the battle to the death is not shrouded in greay shadow or moonlight, but in a bright blue sky day. Goodness does prevail.There are many books which have been, and will continue to capitalizing on the profitable story, such as guides to explain religious signifigance to children. I say, forget them. You child will be delighted with a story of adventure, suspense, and good triumphing over evil. Along the way, they'll pick up not to trust strangers (White Witch), or become a traitor in any sense: the Consequences are hard and real. They'll also pickup a little bit of sorrow for wrong-doing. I'd be slow to teach my children (now adults, but avid readers) the symbolism and it's relationship to the Bible before they went to see the movie. My approach would be to let them decide as they watch it, and unravel the wonder themselves. After that, watch for the teaching moments that will come when the child is telling the part they liked best, or asking questions. More is understood with every reading and when once the video is released, it will be watched again and again. Children are more receptive than most of us give them credit for. The lessons are there - and what a reward discovering and unraveling the puzzle on their own.A bit on the really positive side: Unlike past Classic Stories (Sword in the Stone, Cinderella, Peter Pan, et al), Disney has barely strayed from the storyline. There is no reason to even think of this as a story that needs any help by name-dropping.Certainly, if you haven't already done it, pick up a paperback, spend a few good hours, and brush up on Narnia by re-reading \"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\" before you go into the theater with any preconceived ideas. The movie is as subtle and wonderful as the books. Remember: Aslan is not a tame lion.\n",
      "I had read the book(s) many years ago.  Before seeing the movie  I reread the book just to remember.  While it did not follow exactly, I believe the film captured the spirit of the book beautifully.  Just delightful for everyone!!\n",
      "I actually got this as a gift couple years back, and only watched it for 10 minutes before putting it away.  Mind you I've seen the 1979 version so I thought it was a cheap ripoff.  BUT I just heard PART 3 was coming out on Dec, so I hurried and watched this movie and was blown away! This is by far the best movie I've seen in ages.  If Pt 3 wasn't coming out I probably would have donated this DVD and never seen the imagination and wonders of Narnia, the effects were amazing, it beats Aslan's off-sync puppet mouth of the orig.  My only remorse was why didn't I watch this sooner and why didn't I buy PART 2 when it was $3 on ebay?  Prices gone up but who cares, gonna order Pt.2! Can't wait to watch Pt.3 in 3D!FOR NARNIA!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "When I heard that Disney was doing a version of The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe I was concerned that the film might make a mockery of the treasure that is the Narnia series.  For one thing, the Disney of today is, in my opinion, a pale shadow of what it once was.  I mean, how could the company that produced, say, the enchantment of Snow White and Pinnochio, which left my five-year-old self in awe and wonder, also be responsible for the cynical and artistically inferior Emperor's New Groove?And when I learned that Andrew Adamson, the director of the admittedly funny, but often vulgar Shrek, was at the helm for Narnia, I feared that Mr. Tumnus would suffer from an acute case of flatulence.Then, too, there is evidence that Lewis himself would have had some reservations.  A newly discovered letter, allegedly written by Lewis just four years before his death, indicates that he opposed a film version of Narnia.  Assuming that the letter is not yet another Hooper Hoax, we have Lewis suggesting that television versions of his talking animals, from Fledge to Aslan Himself, would result in \"buffoonery or nightmare\".  And, he added, \"a human pantomine version of Aslan\" (picture a Narnian counterpart to Bert Lahr as the lion in The Wizard of Oz) would be \"blasphemy\".  The film thus seems to have run the risk of making Lewis turn over in his grave.But I stood in the churchyard at Headington Quarry last fall, and there were no signs that his rest was anything but peaceful.Nor need it be.The film positively honors the book and its author.  Indeed, asked whether Lewis would have approved of the film, Douglas Gresham, Lewis's stepson, replied, \"This would be beyond Jack's wildest dreams.\"No doubt about it: Aslan is on the move.But for a few forgivable liberties (for example, the details of the children's and beavers' flight from the White Witch and her canine henchmen), the film is remarkably true to the book--right down to the dead bluebottle fly on the windowsill.  Like the recent film versions of Tolkien's Rings trilogy, the casting is remarkable.  If you have come to know the Pevensie children from reading and rereading the book, you might find yourself wondering how Gail Stevens, the casting director, managed to find the very Lucy who, until now, had lived only in your own mind.  And I find it remarkable that my Mr. Tumnus is the same faun that resided in Adamson's mind as he read the books as a child.Far from buffoonery or nightmare, the film crew's creation of some 23 different Narnian species, from minotaurs and minoboars to giants and dwarves to talking beavers, wolves and foxes, is astonishing and very believable.And then there is Aslan.I'm in over my head as I attempt to speak of the technology--some combination of a thing called animatronics along with computer imaging--that produced the Lord of the whole wood.  Adamson himself said, \"I really wanted the children not to think it was a puppet.\"  Indeed.  This would have been blasphemous.  He added, \"I didnt want them to think for a moment it was just a prop, but to react as if it was right out of the zoo.\"The director underestimates himself.  Aslan is not a tame lion, you see.  Neither the Aslan who emerges from the pages of the book nor the screen version of Narnia's King, who first appears from his splendid pavilion, is the sort of animal who might be kept in captivity.  Somehow, this computer-generated figure has weight: the very ground trembles as he walks.  And he is fierce: his deafening roar is the undoing of even the arrogant and powerful Jadis.  And he is wise: you can see that in his eyes.  And he is good.Aslan is very good.Indeed, perhaps the most remarkable thing about the film is that it manages to do something that makes the books themselves remarkable: it evokes a fierce allegiance to Aslan and all that he stands for.  Here I am, a man of nearly fifty, who prides himself at being rather tough-minded and analytical, falling in love with a character of fiction from a childrens story.  Like the Pevensie children, at the name of Aslan, something seems to jump inside of me.  Like the Cabby in The Magicians Nephew, \"I feel somehow, if I may make so free, as 'ow we've met before.\"There is much talk these days of the Narnia series as a Christian allegory.  There is some basis for this assessment.  But Lewis himself  resisted such a characterization of the work.  The stories are much less an attempt to allegorize the gospels than they are designed to acquaint readers with the Deep Magic that underlies the gospel stories themselves.  As Lewis saw it, western societyperhaps British readers in particularhad become jaded and numb to the Christian themes of good and evil, redemption and self-sacrificial love.  But those themes themselves, removed from an overtly Christian context, are soul-stirring and transformational.  Removed from that context and seen afresh, with centuries of encrusted assumptions and biases stripped away, the reader is permitted to respond directly.  Lewis's aim was one in spirit with that of G.K. Chesterton who, in his own presentation of the gospel message, sought to \"reover the candour and wonder of the child,\" \"shake off the cloud of mere custom and see the thing as new, if only by seeing it as unnatural,\" and \"invoke the most wild and soaring sort of imagination; the imagination that can see what is there.\"There isn't a child in the world who, having been drawn to Aslan, is not heartbroken over what transpires at the Stone Table--and elated over the events of the following morning.  And if our own world is ruled by a King Who would pay such a ransom to save us from our own treacheries, then we owe Him our undying devotion and allegiance.Perhaps the magic has returned to the Magic Kingdom after all.  But this is perhaps a magic deeper still.  Long live the true King!\n",
      "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a great children's fantasy film.  Yet, it is not in the same league as the LOTR series.  As a previous writer states, the World War II sequences at the start should be explained.  Yet, after the children arrive in Narnia, everything flows well.  The talking animals are extraordinary.  Watch the Beavers, Maugrim and the Fox as they talk.\n",
      "I had never read any of C.S. Lewis's books before seeing this movie.  After seeing this movie, my 6 year old daughter is interested in reading the series.  I was hesitant at first about taking my 6 year old daughter to this movie.  But the fight scenes are not as long as what the commercials seemed to make them out to be.  I covered her eyes during the murder of Aslan and at a few parts during the battle scenes.  When Aslan was being killed seemed to be the scariest part of the movie for children to me.  The creatures looked like animals that illustrators from years ago had drawn depicting scenes of hell.  The rest of the movie is just fine for most children.  However, I wouldn't let a preschool aged child watch this movie.I bought the DVD today to put in my daugter's Easter basket because she was asking me if we could buy the DVD.As a Christian myself, I was only made of aware of how the movie might have a Christian theme just weeks before seeing the movie.  A very moving scene for me was when Aslan was walking slowly up to the stone to be killed.  I cried and thank Jesus that he sacrificed his life for me.\n",
      "Four siblings (Lucy, Susan, Edmund and Peter) are sent to live with a family member in a huge mansion.  One day, the four children decide to play a game of hide and seek.  Lucy finds an old wardrobe upstairs and hides in it.  In the wardrobe there are big fluffy coats, but as Lucy steps further back, she fell into a whole other world.  She meets a faun named Mr. Tumnus.  He tells her this is the land called Narnia.  They go to his place and have tea.  After tea, Lucy goes back into the wardrobe and back into `their world'.  She stumbles out of the wardrobe and runs to tell the others what she saw.  Of course, the other three don't believe her and think she's making up a story.  Another day, Edmund stumbles in the world of Narnia.  He meets the White Witch, who gives him something to drink and Turkish Delight to eat.  After the witch leaves, Edmund sees Lucy.  Edmund apologizes to Lucy for not believing her.  Excited now, Lucy and Edmund go back in the wardrobe.  Now, when the other two tease her, at least Edmund would back her up.  But Edmund does a stupid thing.  When asked by Susan and Peter, Edmund denies it, acting as if he was just playing along.  Hurt, Lucy storms out.  One day while all four of them are playing ball, they accidentally break a window.  To avoid getting scolded, all four children run and hide inside the wardrobe.  They too stumble in Narnia.  There, they encounter all sorts of mythical creatures; talking beavers, talking wolves, and most importantly, the king of Narnia, Aslan, who's a lion himself.I read the book and now I watched the movie.  If the movie was based exactly on the book, this movie would be more than 2 hours.  I recommend The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe to anyone who enjoyed the Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings books/movies.\n",
      "This movie version of the great novel is very well done.The C.S. Lewis books have long been favorites of mine.  They use the vehicle of fantasy to portray a spiritual message.  The film is very true to the story of the book.It is set during WWII and features four English children who enter a wardrobe and discover a magical world.  They are introduced to Aslan the lion, the White Witch, and many other interesting characters.  The story is full of Christian symbolism.  It is very well done and can be enjoyed by all ages.I highly recommend this superb story.\n",
      "I have read the book and thought it to be too childish and simple in telling, although with awesome message. It is like a story from the Bible, remodeled so that children can understand the values of love, bravery, kindness and hope. So, seeing what a big promotion this movie has, I decided to watch in theatre.I couldn't take my eyes from the screen! The views are so magnificent; the soundtrack beautiful; The actors and actresses played the four children are very good. No awkward moment. With WETA studio's magic, it is a priceless movie that musn't be missed by anyone!\n",
      "I remember the classic BBC version of the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and and the Hollywood rendition of this classic was awesome.  And then they came out with the Extended version and I saw things in the movie that I didn't see in the movie the first time.  I especially liked the extended battle sceness.  My Favorite part was when Peter saved the Phoenix from getting attacked before it could do what he wanted it to.  That was an unexpected but very cool scene.\n",
      "Lots of outdoor fun. Kids will need proper direction from an adult till they get a hang Of it. Great fun for all ages\n",
      "This movie was great.  The special effects were top of the notch.  It leaves pretty much everything that was in the book and even adds some extras, so if you were a fan of the book you won't be dissappointed.  Although you may have imagined the cretures to look different, it's that way with any fantasy book when turned into a film.  The children were excellent, Edmund is exactly how I imagined him.  The boy who played him nailed the part perfectly as we slowly see him progress into a better person.  The beavers were also very good.Now, as for Aslan.  Aslan's voice was great.  He was made perfectly.  The execution scene was also very good.  It resembled the crucifixion very much and then he rose again.  great movie.\n",
      "For someone who nearly read her copies of the Chronicles of Narnia to shreds growing up, finally getting to see a worthy rendition of \"The Lion the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" was a glorious experience.  The film was beautifully done, true to both the allegory and content of Lewis's work, and a joy to watch.  I cannot wait to see the next one!\n",
      "I LOVE THIS SERIES.  I HAD TO GIVE ONE OF MINE AWAY SO I REPLACED WITH THIS NEW ONE.  I WATCH IT ALL OF THE TIME!!  ALL OF THE MOVIES INN THE SERIES.  CNA'T WAIT TO GET THE NEW ONE.!!\n",
      "I've never seen this movie, but I ordered it as a Christmas gift for my inlaws. This seemed like a really good price on a blu-ray. Movie was securely packaged with the original shrinkwrap. There was no damage & the item was brand new.\n",
      "This DVD was purchased to replace another older one that had been broken.  It has not disappointed me, and I now have the complete set again.  So thank you Amazon for having this DVD available.\n",
      "It's been years since I read \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\", so I have the advantage of not remembering much beyond the general story line.Well, middle aged me loved this film, as did my wife, as did our friends. The effects were believable, the story was right out of the book, and the acting was excellent.  As movie and as adaptation, you won't go wrong with this one.\n",
      "I had a few apprehensions about seeing this film. In the first place, I have not read the books. Allegorical stories tend to confuse me, and I was especially reluctant to undertake an allegorical movie without having prepared myself with some sort of road map. In the second place, having read a number of show biz biographies, I feel uncomfortable about movies featuring child actors, and especially child actors with British accents. And in the third place, I have grown so accustomed to computer-generated special effects that generally I find them as predictable as the magician pulling a rabbit out of his hat. I am happy to report that none of my apprehensions was justified. In the first place, the movie is not so much an allegory as a retelling of the story of the Messiah. There are oblique references to Christmas, Saint Peter, and the blood of the Eucharist, but I think Narnia can also be enjoyed by those who believe the Messiah is yet to come, and by anyone for whom this motif of sacrifice and redemption strikes an emotional chord.  In the second place, the children are very well-directed, and the characters they portray are so meaningfully delineated that the plot (and there is a lot of plot) always seems to just emerge as a consequence of their different personalities. In the third place, all the fawns and beasts and talking animals in Narnia are never presented as precious and remarkable. They simply exist, without any fanfare, and we can accept them on their own terms.  In this regard, however, I must disagree with the reviewer who okayed this movie for young children. The lion is very realistic, and when he quite literally lays down his life to save the worthless sinner Edmund, it is much more disturbing than anything in, say, Bambi or The Lion King. And you might not want your young child seeing what happens when the wolf pack catches up with the fox. Age seven is definitely the minimum viewing age. Actually, the story seems directed primarily at older teenagers, but it doesn't have any lasers or sex or explosions, so what are its chances?\n",
      "Not that I am export at how old a kid should be to see movies, but I looked up the Movie Mom, and she has for the aduiance for this movie at 10 and up, so I guess in her eyes a 9 year old is still to you for this movie, now I am to old for the Movie Mom, but I might use her as a refence on movies like this if I have kids, so I am not a parent so I wouldn't breg that I know these sort of films, but I guess that older kids that can handle the Harry Potter movies, can handle this movie. But really decisons like this, should really be best to be left up to parents, since they know thier kids better, and they know what they can handle.Now including the end credits, the movie runs 2 hours and 22 minutes, and not 2 hours and 15 minutes like the disc of this movie says, and I might bet the tape says about the same thing. And how do you just like the title The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Andrew Adamson who co-directed the Shrek movies directed this movie. And will also direct the sequel The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian that will be set for release in 2008, so this might be a good start for a good series, but we have to wait and see. When the movie begins, 4 kids  Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes),  and Lucy Pevensie (Georgie Henley), are sent from thier home to a professor's (Jim Broadbent) house, which he lives with housekeeper, that is sent to meet the kids, and warns them off the rules and not to disburb the professior. They play a game of hand and seek, and Lucy discovers a warobe, that on the other side takes her to the country of Narnia. And on her arrival she meets a faun, Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy). And she goes to his house with him, and joins him for tea, where they have a visit, along the way she manges to escape from the White Witch (Tilda Swinton). And she returns to the prefissor's home, where she notices her brothers and sister are still playing, and have not even noticed that she was missing. She tells them off her visit to the country, and of course they don't beleive her. But in time, she mangers to gets Edmund to the wardob, and gets him to follwo her into and into Naria, where he meets the witch, that he assumes is a queen, and she tells him that she wants to meet the rest of them. And really before you know it, all 4 kids ends up going into the warob, and in the country of Naria, where they have to get the help of the returning Lion King Aslan ( Liam Neeson), to defeat the witch, and return Narnia to its glory that it has lost.\n",
      "love this movie!had to watch it for a project which was fun.Love the fantasy and story line.great movie\n",
      "C.S. Lewis's classic novel finally gets the treatment it so richly deserved.  As a child I loved this book and six other books in the series.  To this day I read them at least once a year.The casting of the four Pevensies children is absolutly perfect.  The witch, played by Tilda Swinton, is also perfectly cast.  Add to it the spectacular special effects, great humor, closely adapted screenplay, and stunning New Zealand back-drop, Andrew Adamson's vision of the book is closely aligned with my imagination when reading the books.  Please make all six movies, and make sure Adamson is at the helm for as long as possible.\n",
      "\"Behold, the Lion of Judah.\" -Revelation 5:5The first book in C.S. Lewis' fantasty epic \"The Chronicles of Narnia,\" \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,\" has been brought to the screen in almost all of it's glory. Outstanding visual effects, fantastic storytelling, and fine performances all come together in an amazing, action-packed film. My one complaint is that some stuff from the book has been cut, but it doesn't hurt the overall feel of the film.And even though it's a film from Hollywood, the filmmakers keep the stories Christian allegory intact, making it even more compelling as a story of the ultimate sacrifice.I recommend this film to all who enjoy fantasy, epics, and stories of heroic battle and sacrifice.Movie/DVD Grade: A\n",
      "This movie is great! And the high def transfer is, in my opinion, beautiful.  Disney blu ray always seem to deliver outstanding picture quality (the battle scene towards the end looks incredible!)  Unfortunately I do not have a home theater system set up so I can not rate the  audio quality.\n",
      "I did enjoy this movie. They missed their goal of duplicating Jackson's LOTR franchise but there just wasn't as much story or charming foibles to build out here. They really missed an opportunity playing it so safe, but this was still a very good film. The CGI animation is so good now it's almost undetectable and the battles were terrific.For the theology: (Big Suprise) - Aslan represents Jesus. The Snow Queeen represents Satan and ruled the natural world through manipulation of her subjects' dark impulses of fear and envy and the satiation of base needs, i.e. addiction to pleasure in the form of Turkish Delight candy - not sex or money, it's a children's story. Her palace is a frozen and lonely place.Allied against them are God's army, brought together by the animals' more noble qualities. Aslan(Jesus) rules through wisdom and mutual love and respect for his subjects, appealing to their highest potential. And Man, the sons and daughters of Eve, represent the natural kings of nature and God's Creation, masters of all the talking beasts and classical myth-monsters in Narnia.When the Ice Queen comes to the assembled army of Jesus(Aslan), and demands Edmund, as if he were a fallen, sinful human and that as the Old Testament says, an eye for an eye - Edmund had been corrupted - he had sold out his family, and now there was a price to pay.This is of course a theological passion play. In a real war she would have simply been captured and that would be the end of the conflict, but the physical battle here is secondary.Aslan willingly sacrifices himself to for Edmund in a scene of gothic horror among the Ice queen's monsterous circle.And so God saves humanity, giving his only (lion)Son to us, breaking the old-testament Covenant with the ancient Jews represented by the stone table and forming a new one based on the Love of God and his forgiveness of Edmund's - and by extension humanity's - Original Sin.  Only lion(Jesus) doesn't die - he is reborn, greater than ever.Hooray!..After a tremendous, powerful medieval battle the siblings, the True Kings and Queens of Narnia, valiantly win the day, the Snow Queen loses as Aslan pounces on her and Narnia is ruled with Peace and Justice .. until they realize they're siblings and don't have anyone to procreate with, and so they're goin' back to the Wardrobe just in time.Narnia is a beautiful place to visit. It doesn't have the humor or wit to be a true classic for adults, but it does leave an impression of warmth and wonderment and it captured the fleeting youth and innocence of the actors in a beautiful way. It also completely captivated the 5-12 year old crowd at the theatre, itself no small feat. It's certainly worth a matinee ticket price if you have the time.\n",
      "Video and audio quality was excellent.The story: The ongoing battle of good vs evil told in a most excellent way. I have watched this movie at least once a year sense it first came out.\n",
      "A nice little story, with World War II intruding on the beginning. Great casting, with wonderful performances from the four kids, especially the tormented Edmund. Tilda Swinton is great as the Evil Queen, and Liam Neeson sounds nice as Aslan. Great dialogue:\"The top geezer - the King of Narnia!\"\"We're not heroes - we're from Finchley.\"\"You're worse than Beaver on bath day.\"\"Worst day of the year.\"\"Great talking animals, great film.\"The other movies are silly, confusing, or overly violent. this is the real thing.\n",
      "I loved the Chronicles of Narnia and look forward to every upcoming chapter in this series.  This was wonderful because it allowed you to see the goings on behind the scenes, etc that makes this movie such a delight!!!\n",
      "The voice over actors/actresses definitely have mainland accents.  I just wish the Chinese subtitles matched the Mandarin audio.  The missing star is for the mismatch on the subtitles.\n",
      "The movie in interesting with a Christian sense about it.# siblings are sent to a safe area during a war.They find a wardrobe in the house while playing.The other side of the wardrobe leads to a magical adventure.this is a good family movie.\n",
      "Narnia is the best movie ever! The actors are the best! The locations r awesome!! And the story is epic!!!!! Narnia is and will always be forever the best story ever!!!!!!!!\n",
      "The only reason that I gave this movie 4 stars and not 5 was because I think that it was too short. I would have loved for the movie to be longer than 2 1/2 hours long. But other than that I really enjoyed the movie. I think that the children did an excellent job of their roles. I also think that just because you have read the book does not mean that the movie will be exactly the same. I have read many books that were put into movies so I never expect the movie to be exactly like the book. I like to see the writers put a little something of themselves into the movies. Even if you have read the book or not the movie still pulls you in. And that is all that matters. I have bought this movie and my nieces and nephews loved it. No, it is not for all children but a know most will enjoy it.\n",
      "I have enjoyed this movie whenever I could find it on TV... Now I own it and can watch it any time.  This is such a wonderful movie and is good for the whole family.\n",
      "Good Movie for all ages especially children.  Recommend for all viewers. Story is good, the movie was well done.  Suggest you follow this with the other Narnia stories.\n",
      "Good,clean, exciting family movie with a lot of spiritual meaning. Will definitely be watching this movie more than one time\n",
      "This remake is much better than the original.  A must have for the dvd library.\n",
      "My daughter is enamored with the movie. It has it all: mystery, suspense, betrayal, forgiveness, honor, friendship, bravery, sacrifice, and redemption.  Many things a parent hopes to cultivate in a child.\n",
      "I never thought this movie would be good. I thought it was going to be boring as all getout, but I was wrong. This movie was really really good. It grabbed my attention from the start. I loved the storyline and the message behind it. This is a must see movie.\n",
      "If you have never read the literary classic which ultimately inspired this movie, then you will probably get nothing but delight and enjoyment from watching this movie.  But if you, like me, have read and loved all things Narnian, then you might find that the movie version leaves you scratching your head and wondering, \"Why did they change it?  Why not simply create a movie plot that follows the book?\"Unfortunately, I don't have a satisfactory answer to that question.  I can, however, share with you my way of getting past it.In my experience so far, every movie I have seen which was based on a book or play I have read and loved has fallen short of my expectations.  It was only recently (with the debut of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies) that I worked out how to enjoy the books AND the movies...1. Don't take the movie too seriously... It's just one fan's vision!2. No matter what takes place on the screen, it can't take the place of the book in your heart, right?3. If it turns out to be absolute swill, simply refrain from recommending it to others and from seeing it again!\n",
      "This is a very magical and beautiful movie, kids enjoyed and parents as well.I think that everyone should have this movie in their personal collection.\n",
      "While many others have reviewed the actual movie, which I found I liked, I am going to review the DVD version.The DVD packaging is fun; you open the wardrobe to get into the 2 disk set.  The movie is on the first one and many of the extras are on the second one.  I have to say the features on the second one were both fun and educational.  You can take a look at how all the major characters were made.  They give you a look into the CGI and they also show you where they used live animals.The insert guide helped, I tried to look for particular things and was confused until I glanced at it, easy to read and understand.This DVD set is well worth the $ for someone that is looking to watch this story more than once, and for anyone who wants to find out \"how they did that\".  Great spring purchase.Now my 2cents on the movie - it was fantastic.  For someone who hasn't read the books or seen any other versions in 25 years I was blown away by the movie.  There may have been parts that were missing as others have said but as a stand alone movie it was great.  Easy for someone who has not read the books to be caught up in the story.  I for one was blown away by the CGI's especially with Aslan and the Beavers.\n",
      "Great product, i bought it for my 4 year old daughter and she has watched it nonstop since we recieved it. Also very fast shipping, the movie came one busines day after i ordered it. Very Satisfied\n",
      "I have yet to read the book, but am running out soon to read it.I dont know how I missed reading this series.SO I do not know how this translate book to movie.My thoughts on the movie alone.I was in goosebumps many times throughout this movie.The kids did an amazing job acting.  there was so much passion in their family bonds and getting through their angts.  Especially the boys.The special effects are fantastic, breathtaking. so realistic.  I am sure once I read the book I will wish they did more though.  All the animal\\mythological characters have so much life and personality in them.\n",
      "THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLDWith the movie release of \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" on December 9th, based upon the Christian classics by the late Christian scholar and literary genius C.S. Lewis, the world will see one of the most fascinating stories made into film. What the average movie goer won't know is WHY Lewis wrote the original book: (1) to describe what God was like (via the character of Aslan, who is a picture of the \"Lion of Judah\" [Revelation 5:5] or Jesus Christ] and (2) to convey in illustrative form of the salvation story of Jesus--that Jesus Christ (Aslan) was willing to die in our place because we (like Edmund) were in bondage to sin (Turkish Delight) and evil (White Witch).Initiated by a dream that Lewis had at 16 years old, The Lion, Witch, and The Wardrobe built the cornerstone of a seven-book fantasy that has sold 90 million copies over 55 years, establishing itself as one of the most beloved works of Christian fiction of all time. This initial volume follows the journey of the four Pevensie siblings--Lucy, Edmund, Susan and Peter. Set in World War II England, the children enter the world of Narnia through a magical wardrobe while playing a game of 'hide-and-seek' in the rural country home of an elderly professor. Once there, the children discover a charming, peaceful land inhabited by talking beasts, dwarfs, fauns, centaurs and giants that has become a world cursed to eternal winter by the evil White Witch, Jadis.Under the guidance of a noble and mystical ruler, the lion Aslan, the children fight to overcome the White Witch's powerful hold over Narnia in a spectacular, climactic battle, with its central figure, Aslan, the victorious lion who represents Christ--the Lion of Judah, who dies and resurrects just as in the Gospels. Moreover, Aslan, like Christ, voluntarily steps in to take the punishment due to one of the 'sons of Adam'. The children, like the Disciples, are initially grief stricken by Aslan's death but then overjoyed by his return, and then join him to fight against the White Witch and her evil allies. (Of course, there are many other links between the book and the Christian faith.)A GREAT MOVIE THAT IS TRUE TO ITS ORIGINAL BOOK-AND \"THE BOOK\"Well, Walden Media and Walt Disney Studios have now turned this novel of the Christian Gospel into a $150 million movie that will reintroduce \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" to a whole new generation of children and their parents in a \"Lord-of-the-Ring\" type movie format. And this initial Narnian theatrical adventure is expected to be followed in coming years with the following six-volumes being made into movies. (You can see an actual theatrical trailer of this first movie and see more about the making of the movie by going to [...]I must admit I was skeptical at first to have Disney partnering with Walden in making this movie; it is not like they are known for being a bastion of conservative Christianity! As Christianity Magazine (Oct 2005) conveyed,The film has been made by Walden Films, which has a good track record of creating family-friendly movies. The decision by Disney to partner with Walden and distribute this film was initially not welcomed by Christian culture watchers in the US who warned that Disney might want to water down the Christian symbolism. Disney have always denied this intent and [so included] the input of Douglas Gresham, the stepson of C.S. Lewis, who is a co-producer [and] has helped reassure wary Christians. \"I am a committed Christian and I am very happy with the script,\" Gresham confirmed.\"Gresham, serving as co-producer, became the spiritual watchdog and conscience of the movie project, assuring that the movie version kept true and accurate to his stepfather's originals.As a Christian and Pastor, my concerns were further quenched when other national Christian leaders affirmed the value of the movie. \"We believe that God will speak the gospel of Jesus Christ through this film,' said Lon Allison, director of the Billy Graham Centre at Wheaton College in Illinois. Ted Haggard, President of the National Association of Evangelicals, also said that the film was an ideal way for a Christian message to be brought to people who would not otherwise go near a church. \"Here is yet another tool that many may find to be effective in communicating the message of Jesus to those who may not respond to other presentations,\" he said.MY PERSONAL RESPONSE TO THE MOVIE...WOW!Having personally seen the movie, I can tell you it is nothing short of almost EVERYTHING C.S. Lewis intended it to convey. I cannot encourage you enough to see this movie, then read one of the many books that explain how God and Jesus are explained via The Chronicles of Narnia (like \"Knowing Aslan\" or many other books one can get from Amazon.com-including \"The Bible\"). I am so impressed by this movie (and the original book) that at our Christmas Eve Services (where I pastor at Lake Almanor Community Church in northern California), I will be using the movie to help me answer the question, \"What If There Were No Christmas?\" Before Aslan comes, Narnia is in perpetual winter without hope. Before Christ came, our world was lost in sin and without hope. In addition to our sanctuary's normal Christmas décor, the stage will be flocked with snow to represent a winter landscape, like Narnia, with a lamppost and a wardrobe, out of which people exit into the winter pines! As of Sunday, January 9th, I will also begin a Sunday Series through the Gospels, studying the life and nature of Jesus Christ. It will be titled, \"In The Lair Of The Lion Of Judah,\" and will take us through a chronological gallop of the Gospels. One can obtain the CD's of those messages or read more about Narnia at our Church web site: lacconline.org)FROM ATHEIST TO CHRISTIAN SCHOLAR: C.S. LEWIS' SPIRITUAL JOURNEYOne last thing to help you enjoy the movie. Remember that C.S. Lewis' (author of The Chronicles of Narnia) spiritual journey traveled from the extremes of an avowed and antagonistic atheist to a devoted defender and scholar of the Christian faith. His Christian journey can be read in his book, \"Surprised By Joy,\" and his rational defense of the Christian faith (which was originally given in a series of BBC radio programs during WW2) can be read in his book, \"Mere Christianity.\"IN 1916...After Lewis's mother died of cancer when he was only eight years old (about 1908), his father sent him off to a boarding school. On October 12, 1916, Lewis penned his position in a letter to Arthur Greeves: \"I think that I believe in no religion. There is absolutely no proof for any of them, and from a philosophical standpoint Christianity is not even the best. All religions, i.e., all mythologies...are merely man's own invention-Christ as much as Loki. In every age the educated and thinking [people] have stood outside [religion].\"IN 1929...Although an atheist until he was roughly 30 years of age, Lewis began investigating the claims of Christianity during the twenties. On December 21, 1929, Lewis-upon reading John Bunyan's Grace Abounding-wrote: \"I...am still finding more and more the element of truth in the old beliefs [that] I feel I cannot dismiss... There must be something in it; only what?\" In this pre-conversion period Lewis wrote: \"I felt as if I were a man of snow at long last beginning to melt.\" As a result, in 1929 Lewis was converted to theism. He journaled of that experience: \"I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed; perhaps, that night the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England,\" but this conversion \"was only to Theism. I knew nothing about the Incarnation [or that Jesus was God in human flesh].\"IN 1931...In 1931, influenced by his friend J.R.R. Tolkien (\"Lord Of The Rings\"), he became a Christian and a member of the Church of England. On September 28, 1931, at age thirty-two, Lewis was \"riding to the Whipsnade zoo in the sidecar of Warren's motorcycle. `When we set out I did not believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and when we reached the zoo I did.'\" According to 1 John 5:1 and 5, all those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God are \"born of God.\" To Arthur Greeves on October 1, 1931, Lewis wrote: \"I have just passed from believing in God to definitely believing in Christ-in Christianity.\"IN 1941-1944...Although he became an Anglican, he stated that he was influenced by his Roman Catholic friend Tolkien. He was very much interested in presenting a reasonable case for the truth of Christianity, which he did in a series of BBC radio broadcasts, which were developed into his work, \"Mere Christianity,\" in which he states the following: \"I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: `I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept His claim to be God.' That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic-on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg-or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronising nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.\" [CS Lewis, Mere Christianity, Book 2, Chapter 3, The Shocking Alternative]IN 1950...It only took C.S. Lewis three months to write \"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe,\" and he had only one critic, his close friend, JRR Tolkien, who hated it: \"It really won't do,\" he protested. \"Doesn't he know what he's talking about?\" (Perhaps the fact that he was still working on The Lord of the Rings after a decade while Lewis knocked off The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in less than three months had a little to do with it.)  Yet the Chronicles went on to sell over 85 million copies over the last 50 years!As the BBC news reported, \"There can also be few children's books that contain so much theology as the Narnia stories. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is about atonement and resurrection, divine self-sacrifice and redemption. That might sound a bit much for a children's story, and something for parents rather than their audience to pick up on. But not necessarily.\"Lewis's idea was not to write an allegory for clever readers to decode, where Aslan represents Christ. Rather, Aslan is Christ, coming to the world of talking animals as a lion, just as he came to earth as a human. Lewis found children better at understanding this than adults.\"He was not concerned with teaching children the Christian story in disguise, as he expected them to know it already. Rather he wanted them to feel it. As a child himself, he knew the story of the cross and resurrection of Jesus, and knew it was meant to be important, but he had never felt its importance. If he could retell it in terms of a fairy story, it might make sense to children and they might grasp the nobility, tragedy and power of it.\"LISTEN AND LOOK FOR THE SPIRITUAL STORY BEHIND THE ILLUSTRATIVE ADVENTURE OF NARNIA...Wrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight,At the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more,When he bares his teeth, winter meets its death,And when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again. (ch. 8)\"But what does it all mean?\" asked Susan when they were somewhat calmer. - \"It means,\" said Aslan, \"that though the Witch knew the Deep Magic, there is a magic deeper still which she did not know. Her knowledge goes back only to the dawn of Time. But if she could have looked a little further back, into the stillness and the darkness before Time dawned, she would have read there a different incantation. She would have known that when a willing victim who had committed no treachery was killed in a traitor's stead, the Table would crack and Death itself would start working backwards.\" (ch. 15 of \"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\")Bottom line, see the movie! Then read The Book (\"The Bible\").\n",
      "my grandson loved it. great book for all ages. but it for your kids they will love it....... but it promise they will love ti\n",
      "Although I will always love the books more, I love this film. Very imaginitave interpretations of Lewis' story. The film perfectly complements the vision, scale and beauty of the book. I had to let go of some things that bugged me because they weren't the same as I had imagined for so long in my brain. And I think anyone that can do that will enjoy the film much more! Things that make an awesome book don't always translate well into film. Overall this film is great adventure!Specifically for the Extended Edition- I prefer it over the original length, because it adds a few nice details. I was a little annoyed that they only added 15 minutes! And they don't have any deleted scenes in the extras, even though in some of the production/ behind the scenes documentaries on the extras show glimpses of scenes in production that weren't in the film. One such scene showed everyone dancing in the hall of Cair Paravel, including actors dressed as dryads, the tree spirits. It looked beautiful, but they never mention it or show it anywhere else! I think it at least deserved a show as a deleted scene...The bonus feature documentary on the life of C.S. Lewis was very good! I was actually surprised! Anyone who likes the author or wants to know more about the creator of the Narnia books would like this bonus feature. It was very touching.The production documentaries tell the viewer a lot about the creative process, the locations, especially New Zealand, and lots of fascinating details. And I usually hate watching dvd \"the making of the film\" documentaries. You also learn about the film score, the experiences of the actors, inspirations for certain creative elements, and much more.\n",
      "Bought this for the Family collectiion of movies.  Everyone loved it. Would recommend this for any family to add to their collectiion.\n",
      "My grandsons wanted to se the beginning of Narnia.  Renting on Amazon was easy, the video was perfect.  My grandsons loved it.\n",
      "The first book in the Chronicles of Narnia series, the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe takes us to a magical land of talking beasts, enchanted forests, a mysterious but benevolent lion, and an evil witch who rules with an eternal winter.  It is up to four young people to stop her so Narnia can be freed of her tyranny.I absolutely loved this film and I think Adamson did a great job showcasing the magic of New Zealand.  The battle scenes are terrific, especially the sequence involving the griffons, which I thought was extremely original.  Thankfully, we don't see a lot of blood because of the Disney nature of the film but I can forgive them for that.I do have to admit that I don't think it's on the same level as the Lord of the Rings.  Unfortunately, any fantasy film made today will always be compared to Jackson's masterpiece.  Still, Narnia makes an admirable effort and should be considered a classic among the Disney features.\n",
      "It has been a good movie the whole family has enjoyed\n",
      "I had read the book years ago and decided to try the movie. It follows the book very well and the animation is incredible. Amazing how real the talking lions and badgers look. Awesome scenery and just a very well-made movie. Everyone should see this movie for that little kid in you.\n",
      "THe DVD set arrived within a few days of ordering, sealed in original plastic cover as far as I could tell. The DVDs played well.\n",
      "IT'S A MUST-SEE.  A short review cannot do this excellent movie much justice... For anyone who has NOT read the original CS Lewis story: Four children are sent into the countryside, to the manse of a professor, escaping the dangers of war.  While there, they discover a magical wardrobe that allows them entry into the Land of Narnia, where they are swept up in the classic battle of good vs. evil, with great reward at the end.  The Land of Narnia is peopled by the best (and worst) of creatures from fairytales, mythology, and fantasy; that come together in a battle to free Narnia from tyranny, evil, and everlasting winter.  Five stars isn't enough to rate this movie in my opinion. Complementing the great tale spun by C.S. Lewis so many years ago, the movie has absolutely STUNNING scenes, effects, and CGI graphics, excellent acting talents, and a great soundtrack that complements the scenes perfectly.  It's sure to make the Land of Narnia almost a reality to lovers of fantasy and the CS Lewis novels, and will be captivating even to those who have had the misfortune to never experience the Narnia Chronicles books.The movie itself stays true to the book, with little (if any) \"creative license\" by the producers and directors to change it... a true testament to how well-written and timeless the original story is.  Some minor sequences and scenes in the novel are omitted, as with most movies created from book form... but the spirit of the CS Lewis novel is definitely captured in eye-popping detail.As an aside... the title of \"Narnia\" is a bit misleading to those unfamiliar with the original story.  The CS Lewis book this movie re-creates is part of a group of seven novels, titled \"The Chronicles Of Narnia\".  \"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe\" is the first of these seven books (also which I highly recommend you read).  The second book, originally titled \"Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia\", is supposedly being done as a movie, due out in 2008... with any luck, it will equal or surpass it's predecessor.  A small dream come true for me would be to see ALL the books redone into movies as well done as this one.You will NOT be disappointed.\n",
      "I've seen THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE three times now.  I saw it once on the big screen, and then I bought the special edition DVD.  Although I thought some of the special features could have been better (there are lots of bells and whistles for children, but not much for adults), I still give this edition five stars.  What I appreciate most about the movie is that it respects its audience.  I can remember as a child feeling I was being pandered to with silly, fluffy, happy movies.  This is the kind of movie I would have loved as a child.I'm now 50 years old; my husband is 54.  We have both loved this movie all three times.  I don't know how, but somehow the director has completely captured the fullness of my imaginary life as a child.  I used to play with stuffed toys and plastic animals, making up mythical stories.  Watching THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, I was projected backwards into my child's mind and heart.  I hate sappy stories--they depress me.  But this movie is truly moving.  The last time I watched the movie, I promised myself I would not cry (as I had the last two times), but I did cry.  When Peter raises his sword and cries, \"For Narnia and for Aslan,\" I'm deeply moved.Of course if you're a book lover, you're going to love the books best.  But film is a different medium entirely.  When I think of how badly the Narnia books could have been botched by spoiled child actors and by softening the intensity of the action (read:  violence), I get down on my knees and thank the powers that be that didn't happen.  One of the best special features on this edition tells us how the director was chosen and what the director's vision was.  I really can't imagine how this film could have been better.Children in England during WWII were subjected to the worst horrors imaginable.  How natural it is for a child to escape the horror of modern war by imagining a battle fought with honor.  The story embodies all the archetypal imagery that is common in children's imaginings:  a magical healing potion, a swift arrow hitting its target, the destruction of evil, the triumph of good, the courage of a strong heart.\n",
      "I seen it. I will see it again. I'm buying the DVD when it becomes available.To the casual browser of these reviews: Beware of those with halfbaked chips on their shoulders who are going to go all out here nder a variety of \"identities\" in order to post negative 1-star \"reviews.\" These people most likely have not even seen this movie. They just want to trash anything remotely Christian or God-centered that gets media attention.\n",
      "I used the pseudonym of \"Doubting Thomas\" because I doubt that the persons who gave this movie a low rating were basing their critiques on the story line, ability of the actors, or the superb special effects.  In all the reviews I read of 2 stars and lower, the reviewers' animosity toward Christianity was evident.  I found the negative reviews shallow, false, and full of malice.  This is a great film, the best one ever made of this series of stories.  I hope the producer makes movies of all seven Chronicles of Narnia books with the same quality.\n",
      "The Pevensie Children; Peter (William Moseley), the oldest, Susan (Anna Popplewell), the oldest daughter, Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) are bundled out of wartime London, to keep them safe from the bombing, and sent to the country estate of Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent). Bored and isolated in the large house with only a cranky housekeeper to keep them company, the children decide to play a game of Hide and Seek. Lucy finds a large wardrobe, in an empty room, and hides inside. Pushing through a number of furs, she finds that she has entered Narnia. She quickly meets Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy), a faun, who befriends her and takes her to his home. He can't go through with his plan of turning her over to the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and helps her get back. Soon, Lucy and Edmund are both in Narnia and they get separated. Edmund meets the White Witch and she promises him that he can rule the land as King. All he has to do is get his two sisters and his older brother to come into Narnia with him and lead them to the White Witch. All four children are soon in Narnia and learn they may have a deeper destiny.\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", directed by Andrew Adamson, is a delightful holiday film. Based on the first of a series of books by C.S. Lewis, the film captures the wonder of children, the danger of conflict and has a fairy tale quality throughout.Adamson, who co-wrote and co-directed both of the \"Shrek\" films, has created a very realistic fairy tale world. If you have read any of the classic fairy tales, you probably remember that they are quite a bit darker than the Disney films. \"Narnia\" starts in World War II London; the city being bombed by airplanes, people running to shelters. Quickly, we see concerned parents bundling their children off to homes in the country. All of this is based on fact and helps to establish the tone and time of the period. Of course, it helps that this world is gray and bleak and contrasts greatly with the world they will soon encounter. Because of this reality, we are more inclined to \"believe\" the world of Narnia can actually exist. All of this helps to establish the film as a fairy tale; the dark beginnings leading to a world of fantasy.Even better yet, there is real danger in the fantasy world. Upon entering Narnia, some of the children receive treats and tea, but their entire stay doesn't consist of eating candy. They quickly learn that Narnia has dangers, similar to the dangers in their real world, and they have to work together to help Narnia overcome the dark forces.The four children are all very good, but the story centers on the two youngest children. Little Lucy (Henley), the first to enter Narnia, proves to be sweet and trusting, so sweet and trusting that she can't understand why Tumnus would initially try and trick her. Because of her character, Tumnus agrees to help her get back to the wardrobe setting other events in motion. As though he is helping them with their destiny.Edmund (Keynes) is the other standout. Initially enticed by the White Witch's promises, he readily agrees to bring his siblings back because he feels like the middle child he is; he resents his older brother and feels his sisters are a nuisance. Turn them in to become king of Narnia? No problem. But when he begins to realize the White Witch will not live up to her promise, he realizes he has to help his brother and sisters. He has to become their ally, friend and brother. Edmund is the most complex of the children and the most interesting.Tilda Swinton is great as the White Witch. She is very even, but also very menacing and has some wicked costumes. When she initially meets Edmund, she seems like a kind aunt, but as the story progresses, we realize she is very evil and will stop at nothing to get what she wants. She accomplishes this through words and subtle actions instead of histrionics. The costume designers on this film sure had some fun. Her dresses are severe and uncomfortable looking and add immeasurably to her character. Only a wicked witch would wear similar clothing.With \"King Kong\" and now \"Narnia\" it is evident the state of CGI (Computer Generated Imagery or Animation) has advanced to a mind-boggling stage. Jackson's Kong was so realistic, I felt I was watching a human being. In \"Narnia\", Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), the Lion ruler of the good, is also extremely realistic; he slowly blinks, showing his age, his impatience with people, his tiredness. He walks slowly, his haunches moving in such a way that I felt I was watching a lion who could speak. There are a number of animals in the film who can speak and all appear realistic. It is really amazing how advanced this technique has become in a relatively short time period. But as they keep raising the bar, other filmmakers will have to meet these standards or their films will suffer as a result. If they can make an ape and a lion this believable, we better not be subjected to any other cheap-looking or unbelievable computer generated creations.As the story progresses, it becomes pretty clear events are leading to a big battle and the four children will be involved, with Peter leading the charge. You might naturally expect a battle of this type to be \"sanitized\" as it features children and Disney is releasing the film. I was surprised to see that it was very lifelike. People die, the children are in danger as they battle the enemy, and they are threatened by others. The film doesn't show a lot of blood, or swords slicing through bodies, but this isn't necessary to show a sense of menace. We see the beginning of an action, but the film avoids the gorier aspects. Kids in the audience can see that battle is scary and dangerous, without being subjected to the blood and gore other films would show. This may seem like a cop-out, but remember this is a family film, so it is a little odd that these types of scenes are included at all. As a fairy tale, they fit.I am familiar with author C.S. Lewis and the \"Chronicles of Narnia\", but have never read them. You may have heard that there are religious overtones throughout the book and the film. There may be, but I am not overly familiar with religious traditions and practices, so I didn't spot a lot of overt imagery or themes. The few I did recognize didn't bother me. My mother noticed many mother and it didn't seem to bother her. If you are not religious, it probably won't bother you either. You definitely should not stay away from \"Narnia\" because you may be weary of overt religious messages. The messages may be there, but they are integrated into the story well enough to not seem blatant and obtrusive.\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\" is an extremely well-made film and a film suitable for the entire family.\n",
      "Great movie, my son loves it. It's nice to have something other than regular Disney characters out there - and a classic at that! I would highly recommend.\n",
      "I've never been a big fan of the Narnia books.  I always thought there wasn't enough...you really had to fill in the blanks on your own.  I went into this movie expecting something along the lines of \"Lord of the Rings\" and that is pretty much what I got (which isn't a bad thing considering how awesome those films were).  I was completely sucked into this world.  I felt like I was living the entire movie, moment to moment.  Despite knowing exactly what would happen, I jumped outta my chair, I got nervous, and I sobbed, which says a lot about the quality of the movie.  There's a lot more meat on this film than there ever was in the books.  The actors they got to play the Pevensie kids are AMAZING...I couldn't believe it.  Usually these child actors tend to irritate me, but I guess the whole story does rest on them, so it's essential to cast those parts correctly.  I had read reviews about the \"Christian overtones\" and how that may be offensive to people who aren't Christian; all I have to say about that is don't go into this movie looking to complain.  Let it take you over and pull you in.  I promise...you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "I saw this movie last night finally after countless times of trying to go see it and it being sold out, and all I can say is WOW!!! Everything was top notch. The acting, directing, special effects, etc.  Just amazing.As I said in the headline, this deftinley is a must see for Christians.  Everything that happens, you can compare to some part of the Bible or Jesus Christ. It truly is spectacular to see C. S. Lewis's novel come to life.All in all, GO SEE IT!!! You will love it. Take the kids. No, it is not scary for little children. It does have some battle scenes in it, but they are done non-violently if you will, and with children viewers in mind. I took my 5 yr old sister to see it, and she loved it. The whole family should see this together. It's a great 2 hour escape into the world of Narnia that I didn't want to leave. :)\n",
      "I am highly impressed with Disney and Walden's adaptation of Lewis' masterpiece, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe.  They created a great fantasy adventure movie combining intense action, quality special effects, and stellar acting- and it doesn't use profanity or sex to sell tickets.  Amazing.\n",
      "I liked the movie. I would have liked it even better had I not already read the book repeatedly. The reviewers who exclaim how faithful the movie is to the book either have a much higher tolerance for moviemaker's 'poetic license' than I do, or haven't read the book. From the children's meeting with the beavers to their meeting Aslan for the first time, there is only passing resemblance between what Lewis wrote and what appears on screen. The ice floe scene is, well -- what exactly is that? Having noted all that, though, the movie was still riveting to watch, visually stunning, and extremely well-acted by the child actors, especially Georgie Henley as Lucy. If you haven't read \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\", go and see the movie anyway and enjoy the heck out of it. Then read the book and learn the story the author actually wrote.\n",
      "I love when they take a favorite childhood story of mine and adapt it to the big screen. I am always a little weary when it's Disney thou. You never know what Disney is going to do with it, however in the case of The Lion, The Witch, & The Wardrobe, is a homerun. They didn't shorten this film into some hour and a half movie about love. They took their time and told the story as it was meant to be told. All the kids were new to the big screen and were terrific. It's a classic tale that is over 60 years old and it's as fresh and relevant today as it was then. Two big thumbs up for the first of the Narnia tales, personally I hope they make all seven of them into feature films!\n",
      "First the basics.  Then the fun stuff.  Chronicles of Narnia is a modern day classic, that's sure to find its place among the greats--yes such as Lord of the Rings and Wizard of Oz!  We find four World War II children displaced from the London home, and whisked to the countryside.  Life goes from air raids to calm boredom.  Alas, it was not meant to be.  They discover a wardrobe with a back that is...well, another world.  Narnia.  And this strange kingdom needs them-these four, to save the world.If there is one word that describes the underlying motif of this production it is action.  There is, of course, the physical action.  Fight scenes aplenty, from the early bombings of London, to the great climatic battle.  Emotional action pervades the film-between the siblings there are cravings for attention, demands for respect, and above all the draw of familial love.  Then there is the ultimate \"action\" between the Lion and the Witch-action that is physical, emotional, and yes-spiritual!Which brings us to the fun part-many thanks to the secular fundamentalists, who have created such a fuss with their intimations about subliminal Christian messages in the Chronicle.  Some school districts are so religiously hypersensitive that they have banned the Chronicles from their reading lists.  Of course, such hysterical overreactions and anti-religious bias only create controversy, which creates media coverage, which creates free advertising.  Ironically, kids will end up seeing Chronicles as a rebellious reaction to their secular overseers.We Christians made an obscure, and somewhat obtuse Last Temptation of Christ into a minor hit, with our opposition.  Muslims turned the Satanic Verses and Salmon Rushdie into global phenomena.  Maybe these anti-religious zealots will turn an already popular Chronicles into a true sensation.  Thank you, dear secularist, for returning the many favors we've granted you.\n",
      "This film is almost exactly like the book. While the acting is a little \"fake,\" I know that they will get better over time. My only complaint really is that the movie seemed rushed. Like the actors sometimes seemed to do their lines very fast. I'm not sure what it was, but something about the movie didn't sit right with me. I guess I was spoiled by the radio drama by Focus on the Family, which every Narnia fan should hear. While not as good as I was hoping, there are many pluses. The battle scenes are spectacular, and the resurrection scene, while semmingly rushed, is done very well. The opening is truly original and gives a good foundation for two of the four main characters. The humor in the film, even the added dialogue to add more humor, is great. Take the kids and go out and see classical story telling.\n",
      "First i would just like to address the many people who have kept saying that the movie is too much like LOTR and the Harry Potter series (both of which I'm fans of and read the books before seeing the movies). Just to be fair, the book which Narnia is based on came out long before the Harry Potter series. As far as the similarities between the LOTR its no secret that Tolkien and Lewis were good friends. The two even belonged to the same book writer's club. Ideas were bound to have been bounced one off the other. I'm aware of the fact that one of the main disliked similarities between the two was the 'epic-ness' of the climatic battle scene. In the book no details are given about what took place during it, though Lewis does convey a sense of 'bloodiness' to this battle (the degree of bloodiness shown is another matter). Edmund and others are severely wounded. So a battle did go down. The movie simply fills in this hole and besides how boring would the movie have been to skip through such a visual segment. As a child I pictured the clashing of swords and creatures fighting in armor. For me the movie's battle scene wasn't that farfetched...Well, everything but the speed at which Peter mastered swordplay (certainly not as a comical as Lucy and her little dagger). Though in the book it does say Peter and the witch were going at it hard. So I assume that would mean matching one another blow for blow. Also, his knowledge of war strategy seems very instant. In the book, Aslan instructed him on what to do prior to battle. It would have been nice for this to have been mentioned in the movie.Second, addressing you adults who thought the movie childish and 'too nice.' Its a CHILDREN'S MOVIE based on aCHILDREN'S BOOK!! Now, why is that so hard for you adults to wrap your minds around? The Narnia book series was not written full of complexity or detail as say LOTR (a book geared more for adults, hello, are you guys grasping the concept now? Pphf, probably not for you more dense ones). Once again these books were written for CHILDREN. Now addressing, the lack of gore and bloody entrails, children are not 'little adults.' And so the matter of violence and death is handled with more subtley so not to be too overwhelming, yet still get the idea across. Some might say the lack of blood could be called the 'sanitizing' of death. However, I think we should give children more credit. When Simba's father was trampled by the wildebeast and Bambi's mother shot dead I think everyone got the idea. The same is with Narnia: Aslan getting stabbed with a knife and the witch proclaiming the lion dead. I think kids got the message without the spraying of blood.Get over it!That said I'll move on to the performances. The children did a good job I think considering that none of them had ever starred in a movie before. The kids in the Harry Potter movies were once in the same position and have blossomed I think. I think given time and should the Narnia series continue to be made into movies the same could be expected of the Narnia child actors. I thought Liam Neeson did a great job as the voice of Aslan. Very emotional and regal. I loved the look of the white witch and the performance of the actress that played her. By not over playing the role I think she made it much more believable and effective.The CGI effects were okay in parts and great in others. Though the same could be said in LOTR. Now admittedly, I think the CGI effects better in LOTR but CGI is tricky. And anyway the overall movie should be based on the telling of its story and the power of the message. Well, in my opinion anyway. We are living THINKING creatures afterall, not amoebas.To those rigid, rear clenching individuals who call themselves purists and TRUE FANS of the Narnia series:  Of course the book was better than the movie. Books in my experience usually are. However, I am able to be reasonable and realistic. Written and visual media are two different things. If you can't distinguish between the two then you should'nt have watched the Narnia movie in the first place. I had no problem with the slight changes in the movie. Overall, I think the screenplay remained pretty true to the book. I still walked away feeling entertained and having enjoyed a similar version of the book I loved and read as a child.Hey, this was a good movie. Certainly good for its worth.\n",
      "While even my 5 year old picked out a few of the book-to-movie inconsistencies, for the most part this was a well-made movie.  The picture quality was superb and definitely kept the entire family enraptured.  I found that I enjoyed it more than the BBC version, not necessarily because of accuracy, but because the cinematography was lovely.  I must say, the White Witch was my favorite, spot on character portrayal.  Tilda Swinton was PERFECT for that role and acted it with, well, perfection.\n",
      "When the Pevensie family are evacuated out to the country, they are unaware of the adventure they will encounter. During a game of hide and seek, the youngest daughter, Lucy discovers a wardrobe which transports her to the land of Narnia. Covered in snow, Narnia is full of weird and wonderful creatures, but is watched over by the evil White Witch, Jadis.  When all four Pevensie children end up through the wardrobe, they discover that it was meant to be, as two daughters of Eve and two sons of Adam must join with the mighty lion, Aslan to defeat the evil White Witch. It's a movie of intelligence and power, of beauty, universality and largeness of spirit. An engaging and exciting family movie that feels good to watch.\n",
      "Sadly, I was not one of the millions of children who read this series of books as children and were mesmerized by C.S. Lewis' captivating descriptions of a world outside of our own. On the other hand, fortunately I read this series at a time when I could appreciate them in a greater way than I could have if I had read them as a youngster.The movie adaptation of this classic brings vivid life to the novel! While there were a few changes to adapt it to the screen, it is mostly faithful to the words that C.S. Lewis wrote down some 50+ years ago. Thanks in large part to computer-assisted design, characters like Tumnus and Beaver looked very realistic and conformed to the images I already had in mind when I read the book. While not every character had a lot of flare, I believe Lucy and Edmund were brilliantly casted! The dynamics between Beaver and his wife were wonderful, and even minor characters (like Jadis' midget servant) were great!Comparisons between this film and Lord of the Rings are inevitable, but unfair in my opinion. Yes they are both fantasies, both filmed in New Zealand, and originally written around the same time period by two men who were close friends. However, the authors' intentions in releasing the books were completely different. C.S. Lewis wrote his works to be allegories, and to present the gospel message to kids whose parents would otherwise forbid them to hear the stories. Tolkien (author of Lord of the Rings) was also a Christian, but did not have any hidden agenda in his works. The intended audiences that the authors had in mind were also different - Lewis definitely aimed his stories at children, whereas Tolkien included far too many details to keep most young people enthralled. I believe this difference in intended audience accounts for some of the negative reviews that this movie has received. Ask most children under age 10 which movie they liked better, and I'm quite sure you'll see that Narnia is preferred.This DVD has minimal special features, so I recommend the special collectors' edition if you want featurettes and other bonus material. For the movie itself, this one gets 5 stars!\n",
      "I loved this movie!!  It had great special effects, and you could tell that effort was put into producing it and hiring good, efficient actors and actresses.  As I recall, it was a lot like the novel.  And they hired the perfect person as the witch (creepy!)  I thought the four young kid actors were outstanding.  They did a great job!!  I am looking forward to seeing them in more movies, and I've also heard that another Chronicles of Narnia book (Prince Caspian) will be made into a movie in Christmas of 2007.  I hope it will.  It would be kind of silly not to make another \"Narnia\" movie, since this one did so well.  I've heard that it made over $638 million dollars....WOW!  I even think it out-did Harry Potter, which is definitely quite an accomplishment.This was the first movie I'd actually heard people clap for after watching it.  It left you with a good feeling.One thing I'd like to point out in particular...It is probably a little frightening for younger viewers.  I believe the movie was rated \"PG\" so that they would get a wider variety of audience, like really young kids (three and four year olds.)  Parents, if your very young child hasn't seen this movie in theaters, but you're thinking of renting this movie, don't.  Wait until they are a few years older, because this movie will probably give very young kids nightmares and make them afraid.  I don't think it would bother MOST seven and eight year olds, though.  The MPAA should have rated this film PG-13, but not as many people might have gone to see it.The plot is good, and it kept you enthralled in the story until the very end.  This is a movie that will appeal to anybody, Christians and non-Christians alike.  For Christians, this movie has strong spiritual parallels from the gospels, as is evident through Aslan.  For non-Christians, it's a fantasy/adventure film to enjoy, and even though it does have spiritual parallels, it won't feel like you're getting the Bible shoved down your throat.If you haven't seen this movie yet and aren't a really young child, I encourage you to see this movie either in dollar theaters or rent it out from the movie rental store.  (For some places, it might still be in theaters.)  It's a good movie.\n",
      "This is a great family movie. There are not any innapropriate scenes to ruin the movie.  The special effects are wonderful and it follows the book very well.  There are a few battle scenes but nothing graphic.\n",
      "Without the spectacular commercial and critical success of `Lord of the Rings,' no one would have given a green light to the production of the faithful adaptation of `The Chronicles of Narnia.' In that sense, the first film made out of the seven books of C S Lewis cannot be seen without being compared with the Peter Jackson's trilogy. In short, is `Narnia' is as good as that?My answer is `almost.' Disney et al. made a decent fantasy film out of \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\" It is less ambitious in its scale and story, but the film's impressive visuals make up for its less imaginative direction and sometimes dull screenplay. The computer generated creatures are all remarkable, and the good lion Aslan is realized with the voice of Liam Neeson, who provides the dignity of the character.Tilda Swinton is also impressive as White Witch. Probably she is more famous for playing the unique roles in such films as `Orlando' and `Constantine,' and her enigmatic presence perfectly fits in the ice queen character. Of course, that's unless you have already created your own image of the Witch, but her delightfully twisted acting worked for me. The four main young characters, the four children who wander into the land behind the wardrobe - Edward, Lucy, Peter, and Susan - are all played by newcomers, and their acting sometimes shows it. Not that I am complaining, but it must be admitted that the creatures in Narnia like giants, fawns, beasts, talking animals especially Mr. and Mrs. Beaver are more memorable in the film.Finally, about the tone of the film. The religious connotations are subdued, but you may not find it damaging. The producers are obviously aware that they are making a family picture, and the overall tone of the film is less dark than `Lord of the Rings' or recent `Harry Potter' films. And my verdict: \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" is no groundbreaking achievement, but still an entertaining fantasy.\n",
      "My  10-year-old son and I watched the movie after he read the book. We both loved it! I highly recommend it.\n",
      "Our family loves this movie.  It has something for everyone.  There is mystery, challenges, battles, good versus evil, plot twists and plenty of surprises.  Very captivating!\n",
      "I need to preface this review by saying that I am a huge fan of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA. In fact, they are my favorite books of all time. C.S. Lewis is my favorite author--I've read a wide variety of his works (including some essays he wrote about 17th century English literature) and, in my opinion, the man was not capable of bad writing. I remember when I was about 11-12 years old and after a terrible argument in my family, I tried repeatedly over and over and over to get away from it all and go to Narnia by traveling through a forgotten closet in the house. When I was about 18 along with a rough draft of a screenplay for THE HOBBIT, I also started writing a screenplay for THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE.My petty attempts at bringing the work to life could not even be compared to the live action version of the story that now exists. There is so much about the film that is well done. The acting, the images, the effects, the dialogue, etc.The movie does an excellent job of setting up the plot. For the first five or so minutes of the film the audience isn't greeted by the happy faces of children chatting with fauns or eating supper with cheery beavers. Instead, the movie opens with the Battle of Brittain raging over London and Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter Pevensie being rushed out of their home and into a bomb shelter by their mother. Worried for the life of her children, she ships them off far into the country to live with a gentle, erudite professor (this whole opening sequence would be a great clip to show during a WWII history lesson).One day while playing hide and seek in the huge manor, young Lucy gets lost in the wardrobe she is hiding in and finds herself transported to the magical land of Narnia. There she meets the faun Mr. Tumnus and almost immediately becomes friends. After spending the evening at Mr. Tumnus' home, Lucy returns back through the wardrobe door only to discover that she hasn't been missing at all. The wardrobe is searched, but it seems to be just a plain, beautifully ornate wardrobe.Eventually, however, the truth is revealed and Lucy and all her siblings are transported to Narnia. Edmund, who traveled to Narnia before with Lucy, is captured by the evil White Witch Jadis. To save their brother, the siblings rush to meet the King of the World, Aslan and learn along the way that they are a part of a long-fortold prophecy that is coming true. What follows is a mad dash through a melting winterland, a sacrifice of grandest proportions, and an epic battle led by a teenage king.The visuals in the movie are absolutely stunning. The colors chosen for the creatures who follow Aslan and those who fight under Jadis couldn't be more perfectly matched. The movie follows the plot of the book fairly accurately (there are some dramatic liberties taken and a few things left out--but this is a movie, not a book) without taking anything away from the essence of Lewis' story. Many of the creatures were created either through CGI or good old costume-animatronics and due to the nature of the story, there isn't a ton of dialogue acting. Still, at the heart of the story are the children and Aslan and they come off wonderfully. Liam Neeson is the voice of Aslan and though he sounds different than what Aslan sounds in my head, I think the choice was well made. The children are the true stars of the movie and the standout of the four is Georgie Henley as Lucy. Her reactions are perfect and the relationship between Lucy and Mr. Tumnus (as played by James McAvoy) is especially well done.There have been many comparisons made between this film and Peter Jackson's version of THE LORD OF THE RINGS. I've heard some say that this is like a child's version of those movies. The same comparisons were being made between Tolkien and Lewis when their stories were published (except people said that THE LORD OF THE RINGS is like an adult THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE). One cannot deny that if THE LORD OF THE RINGS films had never been made and weren't successful, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE would never have been made into a live action feature film. However, because of the success of The Ring, we can now have all the Chronicles of Narnia on screen, too. Yes, WETA helped make some of the costumes and parts of the movie were filmed in New Zealand. However, despite these similarities, the movies are totally different films. THE LORD OF THE RINGS is a 9-hour epic told in three parts. THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA are a series of 7 separate, yet connected tales all about the same place. TLotR films are very violent with a lot of black orc blood and violent images. LION doesn't have much of that though there are a few (actually, I would have liked to have seen the battles been more graphic--true fairy tales aren't afraid to tell and show the evil and darkness that abounds). Finally, Tolkien was adamant throughout his life that his story was not like Lewis'. On the other hand, Lewis, though he was frank about the stories not being allegories, did say that there were allegorical elements to them. These elements are still preserved in the movie and bring about some of the more powerful moments in the film.Overall, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is an excellent adaptation of C.S.Lewis' beloved opening book of the Chronicles of Narnia. Very young children might be afraid at some moments (though the bright colors might distract them enough not to do so), but for anyone else in the family this movie is highly recommended--unless you don't like fantasy or spirituality.The special 2-disc DVD collection is filled with over 10 hours of extra features. There are commentaries with the director, Andrew Adamson, and the four children who portray the Pevensie children as well as commentary with some Adamson and some of his production crew; there are bloopers; there are several featurettes, including a brief documentary about C.S. Lewis; as well as many other extras. One extra I enjoyed particulary was the \"Legends In Time\" feature. This little ditty is basically a comparison of the time in Narnia and how it compares with time in our world. I found it to be quite clever. The Special Edition DVD of THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is a fan's delight.\n",
      "I liked the war at the end- the queen was powerful.I like how the kids worked together and were brave and became king and queen at the end.\n",
      "Fantasy is probably the best type of story telling out of all the work that has been put on pages and movie screens. With cinema reaching its peek with technology and special effects finally the greatest of the classic fantasy tales can be told. Flying off the coattails of probably the greatest epic ever created: J.R.R. Tolkien's `Lord of the Rings', comes his true life friend C.S. Lewis's Epic: `The Chronicles of Narnia'.The Chronicles of Narnia is 7 stories of a fantasy world that has been under the ruling of Jada the White Witch who was told of a prophecy. Four Human Children would find their way to Narnia and when they did they would allow the true ruler of the world to rise and they would rule along side him as royalty. The first movie `The Lion the Witch & the Wardrobe' is actually the 2nd chapter of the Chronicles and in this story the prophecy is fulfilled. The Pevinse siblings who were sent to the country side of London during WWII stumble upon the world of Narnia through an old wardrobe in their foster home. Then their journey beings as they encounter talking animals, incredible dangers and fantastic magic at every turn. Then the true adventures of Narnia begin.Unfortunately for me I had to miss this movie in the theaters. Being a true fan of the epics like `LOTR', `Harry Potter', `Star Wars' etc, I was eager to pick up the DVD. Unfortunately, people were giving this movie a bad rap. One reason was because it was from Disney, two people were talking about the large amounts of Christian overtones and of course people thought it would be extremely childish and toned down. For once in your lives people, try to forget all of that and just pretend it's an actual movie? I don't think that the people who put this movie together would have wanted to ruin the true story at all. The movie was very well done, it was not the best movie I had ever seen, but it was fun it was exciting and it was not Disneyfied at all. If you are into fantasy and happen to have actually read the book then I am sure you will not be disappointed. If you think about it, no one really was. Because with all the bad rap, Narnia remained in the theaters in the top 10 movies for 4 months and `The Prince Caspian' is set for December 2007 release.\n",
      "The movie arrived quickly and in good condition. The Movie is subject to personal likes and dislikes but I enjoyed it very much.\n",
      "Amazing movie.  My kids love it and have watched it so much that they wore out the DVD and had to re-purchase the move.  It has excellent dialogue, amazing battle scenes, teaches good morals, and you can't help but fall in love with the Lion.  I highly recommend this movie for you and your family.\n",
      "This is one of those truly amazing movies that have meaning for all ages and can be seen by all ages. Wish we had more of these truly inspiring movies.\n",
      "we were tired of renting it so we got a copy of all three for ourselves, now we can watch it any time with out having to pay for it and there will never be a late fee\n",
      "I have to say that I was a bit skeptical of Disney getting hold of such a classic story and making it into a movie. I figured they would destroy the parallels it has with the story of Christ and his redemption for all mankind. BUT.....that was not so! Disney did such a fantastic job transferring the story from the pages to the big screen.The movie was not only well done by the young actors and actresses but also by the animators. Aslan was just so completely awesome that I kept forgetting he was animated. There were several parts in the movie that I found myself so utterly and completely enthralled and touched that I was choked up. I love the part when Aslan defeats evil. That was just such a powerful part of the movie among many others.Regardless of your age or gender, I highly recommend this movie. My 12-year-old daughter, 36-year-old husband and myself (35 years of age) all loved the movie but for completely different reasons.\n",
      "Excellent movie!!! They did a good job; it's very close to the contents of the original book. A must-see!2 Thumbs up!!!\n",
      "I liked the Narnia books as a child, and I really enjoyed this movie. It is simply amazing what can be done with computer imaging these days. The creatures in Narnia were all completely believable.Now as to the real stars of the show (as far as I'm concerned): Mr. and Mrs. Beaver. These two working-class heroes of Narnia really deserve a film or perhaps a television series of their own. I would love to go to their home for a nice cuppa and chat about the state of the world and things in general. Perhaps they could have a news show or something on the BBC and offer commentary. Barbara Walters should do an interview.Better yet, Mr. Beaver should stand for Parliament! I want to see him challenging Tony Blair on television! More policemen and hospitals for Narnia!Excellent movie, overall.\n",
      "This is quite simply the best book to film adaption ever accomplished by Hollywood. EVER.I am an author myself, and part of what inspired me was Narnia. My heart will always be tied to this land created by CS Lewis. It is pure magic, this man was a phenomenal writer and his story is THE original fantasy.First, let me tell you about my usual reviews of book to movie translations.I absolutely detested the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.I know it sounds harsh, but I hated those movies.Peter Jackson, though a great director in his own right, absolutely butchered Tolkiens world.To me, those movies are as if he took the book, rammed it into a shotgun, fired, and picked up scattered remains, glued the mismatched pieces together and handed it to the actors.Thats how bad I think they were.If the books had never been done, those movies would be great as stand alone movies, but they aren't, because they removed many of the better sections of Tolkiens tale.Harry Potter. I loved the first few books, and I got really pissed off at the movie when it came out because once again, they cut out many of the better scenes in the book. I stopped watching the movies after the second one.So, as you can probably expect, when I walked into the movie theater in December, waiting to see The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, I was very antsy, and very skeptical.Narinia was closer to me in my heart than any of the other novels that Hollywood had ruined, so I was expecting the worst, and at the same time, dreadfully depressed at what \"the worst\" could mean.I walked in, I took my seat, and the film started.The beggining \"Blitz\" scene began, and I immediatly noticed how close to reality the planes and bombing manuevers were. (Being a historian at heart, thats a brownie point right there) Then I realised the importance of this first scene. The director was putting the viewer into the middle of Lewis's time. Showing you what surroundings he was writing this from. Right then, I started to hope.And as the movie unfolded, as the children got on the train, and that first opening strain of true \"Narnia\" music began to play, I began to cry.No joke.I sat and cried for the first few minutes as I heard that music.Because I knew right then and there, Narnia had stepped out of CS Lewis's mind, out of his book, and onto this screen.This director had managed to bind the very essence of Narnia into this movie.There are differences. It is true, changes were made. But they were small, they were few, and they were far between.And whatever it was that the director did with this movie, it bound the spirit of the book into this film.I cannot tell you how happy I was when I left that movie theater.There are no words to describe it, and coming from a writer, who describes things for a living, thats pretty damn hard to come by.This film is magical. Everything, all the casting, all the sets, all the lines, are as if they were personally overseen by C.S. Lewis himself. When you watch this film, you are THERE. You have stepped through and walked into Narnia.So, if there is any doubt in your mind about buying or watching this movie I hope I have cleared it up, because I tell you if you shell out whatever cash to buy this, you will be very, very glad you did.The best thing to do with a movie like this, is gather your family close to you, sit on the couch with the lights off, on Christmas Eve, and watch this.Welcome to Narnia folks, I never thought we'd make it, but guess what? Aslan has worked a miracle just for you and me.\n",
      "C. S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia can be enjoyed on many levels whether you look at it as a Christian or an atheist. An enjoyable epic saga of good (Aslan the Lion) vs. evil (the White Witch),Lewis' tale begins as Peter, Lucy, Edmund and Susan are placed in the countryside to avoid the destructive bombs of the Nazi's during WWII. They find a gateway to the magical world of Narnia in a wardrobe closet. The children represent liberation fulfills a prophecy where Aslan the Lion (Liam Neeson) will, with their assistance, free the inhabitants of Narnia from the frozen wasteland of the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).Having read the books when I was younger, I have no problem with some of the changes made to the story as they only enhance the film. Remember that often what works on the printed page doesn't work in a film and vice versa. While there's considerable sword play the film is appropriate for most children. There's no swear words nor are there any sex scenes. It's amazing to me that the film got made without Hollywood somehow jazzing up this presentation for the movies. The major battles have much of the scale of Peter Jackson's \"Lord of the Rings\" and this film makes an excellent companion piece to Jackson's trilogy of films about Middle Earth.A marvelous looking DVD, \"Narnia\" is great in either the single disc edition (which is available in widescreen and full screen) or the double disc edition. Which edition you get depends upon how many extras and behind-the-scenes featurettes you want to watch. If the movie is all you want the single disc edition is plenty and has commentary tracks by the director and the children that appear in the movie. There's also outtakes from the movie included as well as \"Narnia Fun Facts\".The two disc edition might appeal more to adult or teenage collectors; it features a number of marvelous featurettes on the production of the movie including \"Chronicle of a Director\" which details the production of the movie. \"The Children's Magical Journey\", \"Creating the Creatures\" (which is pretty self explanatory_ and an excellent if brief featurette on author C. S. Lewis called \"C.S. Lewis: From One Man's Mind\". The \"Anatomy of a Scene\" is marvelous because it breaks down how the sequence where the river is melted was created covering everything that went into this magical and symbolic sequence from the film.There's also a section called \"Creatures, Lands & Legends\" that provides a cool 3-D map of Narnia, a timeline for the film and where it fits in the overall scheme of things and \"Creatures of the World\" featurette that focuses on all the creatures in the mystical land of Narnia. While it's considerably more expensive (depending upon where you purchase it of course) than the single disc set, fans will want to pick up this edition. Reportedly director Andrew Adamson may be working an extended edition of the film to be release just in time for Christmas if the DVD does well. Much like the \"Kong\" set scheduled for Christmas (if there's enough of a demand for it), the \"Narnia\" rumor has it will include an extended cut of the film with deleted scenes in addition to some new featurettes on the making of the film.\n",
      "I loved this movie when I first saw it, and now my two \"Narnia-crazed\" granddaughters are in heaven.  There were shrieks of delight at Christmas!\n",
      "My kids love this movie. I get glued to the TV when I watch this movie. We watched it few times, but it just keeps us engaged throughout.\n",
      "There is no other way to describe this movie than it is simply a masterpiece.  I grew up reading the Chronicles of Narnia and 38 years after I first read them I still have the books in my collection.  I will own them for the rest of my life, they are that important to me.  And usually when a film comes out that is taken from a book I love, I find far too much wrong with it because it too many liberites are taken with the story to bring it to the screenBut this movie does as good a job of staying true to the book as any movie I have ever seen.  Narnia comes alive in this movie and the director's vision of Narnia is downright spectacular.  The wardrobe was exactly as I imagined it when I first read the book so many years ago.  And the lampost in the winter Narnia right outside the Wardrobe was perfect.  In the movie, though, you could hear the soft hissing of the gas in the lampost, just an unbelievable touch that is characteristic of this movie.This movie could not have been made even 5 years ago, not in the same form, not as believably as it was made now.  The technology didn't exist even five years ago.  The CGI work was as well done as any movie I've ever seen and was integrated with live actors in an absolutely stunning and jaw-dropping way.  Tummus, the faun, was played by a live actor, and to see him walk into his house with Lucie and stamp the snow from his hooves was absolutely convincing in the movie.  Talking beavers with real expression, no problem.  Centaurs, fugeddabout it, the guys that made this movie knock that out easily.  This is by far the most technically proficient example special effects I have ever seen in a movie.  It makes Lord of the Rings look dated and cheesy.Just stunning, and it doesn't detract from the story at all, because everything is absolutely believeable.  It's that well done.And story, what a story!  Evil exists, and there is no negotiating with it, no ignoring it, no surrendering to it.  Sometimes you just have to fight it, even if you are a child.  It's part of growing up, it's part of being human, it's part of being moral.  It is a choice and it's a choice a moral being makes.  It trumps self-interest.The casting was phenomenal, the acting was fabulous, the story is timeless, and the effects were real life quality.  I was just stunned watching this movie, I can't imagine anything that could possibly make it better.A Masterpeice.\n",
      "My family loves all the stories of Narnia.  The roar of the Lion and Lucy's smile in the movie are as good as we had hoped.\n",
      "Four children stumble into the magical world of Narnia, where animals speak, witches rule and winter is eternal. Their arrival sets into motion a revolution, as the \"good guys\" believe the children are the same four prophesized to bring balance to the force...err, destroy the one ring of power...oops, I mean rescue Narnia from the White Witch.The tale plays to the same Good versus Evil conflict that drives the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings films. It also benefits from similar special effects magic, solid acting and exciting moments of peril. This type of film does not appeal to me (although I loved them when I was younger), so I am not the person to judge how this film compares to the contributions of George Lucas and Peter Jackson. I have a feeling it falls just short of reaching the scope and imagination of those films and (although financially successful) will not match their iconic status.Many define this film by its Christian allegories, which is not fair to the film (for good or bad). People who avoid the film because they believe it to be a tool used to proselytize will also have to miss Superman, The Green Mile, The Matrix and most other films dealing with sacrifice or execution. Yes, the books were written by a Christian and a solid metaphor for Christ exists in the story, but religion does not overwhelm the picture anymore than it does Star Wars or Lord of the Rings.\n",
      "i really like this imaginative world. i never saw much of it when i was a kid. didn't read the books, but i am very happy to have found it as an adult.\n",
      "C. S. Lewis' CHRONICLES OF NARNIA are rather more complex than the surface story indicates at first glance. Although the books and, in this case, the video adaptation of the first book, can certainly be enjoyed at the story, or plot, level, a little thoughtful analysis can extend that enjoyment even further.Certain parallels or equivalencies between Lewis' stories and Christian mythology are immediately obvious: Aslan is Jesus, and I must admit that during the scenes of his execution and reappearance, Johnny Cash's rendition of the Protestant hymn \"Were You There When They Crucified My Lord?\" kept playing through my mind in an endless loop. The seduction of little brother Edmund by the White Witch suggests the legend of the Temptation of Christ by Satan or perhaps even the actions of the disciple Judas Iscariot.  Most obviously, the residents of Narnia refer to the human children who have fallen into their midst as \"children of Eve\" and \"children of Adam,\" and it is these humans, with the aid of Jesus/Aslan, who vanquish evil and bring peace again to the land. The children, therefore, can be seen as Jesus' disciples, spiritually vanquishing destructive forces and bringing salvation to the inhabitants of Narnia.I do find the character of the White Witch troublesome.  She is equated with the frozen death that accompanies unending winter, and her color suggests the frigid sterility of snow and ice.  She is a seductress who almost ensnares Edmund into betraying his siblings.  Beyond her general evil, however, I cannot find a comfortable parallel from Christianity.  She seems more akin to the overseer of the Norse hell, which is a frozen wasteland, for her symbols are the antithesis of the burning, fiery hell of Christianity.  In any event, she symbolically turns souls to stone as she physically  petrifies the bodies of those who displease her. It may be that Lewis intends to cast her as the anti-Christ, and her destruction is a celebration of the superiority of Jesus/Aslan.Lewis' casting of the wolves as the witch's secret police and executioners reflects what must have been his ignorance of and consequential prejudice against these social animals.  It may well have been a common misconception and bias of his place and time, but it perturbs a modern reader and viewer who better understands the true nature of these creatures.Reading the CHRONICLES inevitably leads one to form images of the characters in one's mind and to contrast those images with the ones portrayed in the filmed version.  I was disappointed only in the depiction of Peter, the oldest brother.  He seems less capable in the film than one would expect, and his clumsy pointing of his sword, as though it were a spear, may be realistic for a young lad with no training in use of the weapon, but it is hardly appropriate for a fictional hero.Technically, the film is almost first rate.  The fauns, centaurs, and the Minotaur are wonderfully depicted, as are the other sapient non-humans.  Still, I must use the word \"almost\" because the film-makers apparently did not have enough imagination to create new creatures as warriors for the White Witch and recruited a number of Orcs from the cast of Tolkien's THE LORD OF THE RINGS movies.  Fortunately, the Orcs have simple \"walk on\" parts and never dominate lengthy scenes as they do in the RINGS films.  Also, neither Lewis nor his film adapters have produced as dark and foreboding a story as did Tolkien, though both series are similar allegories depicting the struggle of good against evil.  NARNIA is definitely a lighter film, in terms of both story development and setting, than are the RINGS.  Despite some of my frustrations with it, NARNIA should be highly entertaining and pleasing to most audiences.  The story and its creatures are captivating to younger viewers, and its symbolism and allegorical significance are intriguing to more mature audiences.  By the way, if you have only seen the film, read the book as well; you will not be disappointed.\n",
      "I still remember be given the British edition of the Narnia Chronicles as a child (An Aunt enjoyed traveling in Great Britain). This movie does a wonderful job of retelling the story. Of four children, long foretold, suddenly appearing in Narnia. Of one falling into evil, being undeservedly redeemed. Of overcoming, against all hope, the great White Witch. For Christians, a great deal of symbolism is readily apparent. For those who are not...they might not even notice. A wonderful, wonderful story. I felt moved to reread my old copy before and after the movie. Sometimes the emphasis is a little different, but C.S. Lewis left much to the readers imagination. In a movie, you are necessarily taking a ride on someone else's imagination. And they did a good job.\n",
      "Movie came Brand New as stated in description, Need to find other two movies to go along with it, to complete collection.\n",
      "I have had this disc for a month, and am still working through the bonus features on it. Disney jam-packs their BluRay releases with Bonus features, and this one is no exception. When you have a whole extra BluRay (not DVD) of bonus features included.... I think the disc claims over 14 hours.The video transfer is crip and sharp, and film grain is next to non-existant. Colors are vibrant, blacks are true - you would think that this film was shot with HD cameras rather than being a film transfer. The audio tracks will blow you away - just the bombing scene at the begining of the movie with the Dolby Digital soundtrack will work out your subwoofer - mine was bouncing off the floor. But there is more - like most Disney releases, this includes an Uncompressed PCM audio track, which, gratefully, the studio did not limit the disc to work only over HDMI. This is one of the few titles that I was able to export the PCM in 5.1 channels over my toslink cable!Don't be fulled by the number of languages listed on the back of the package - there are WAY more audio tracks than this. Every major European language is represented on the disc, as welll as a few middle eastern and Asian languages. The audio comentaries are actually pretty fun on this disc - I think I had more fun listening to the audio commentary of the children and the director than I had watching the movie.The only drawback to this disc is, like most Disney releases, it is a bit on the pricy side, costing over $25 at Amazon (don't even ask how much this thing costs at Best Buy, you are liable to have a heart attack). However, it was a nice addition to my BluRay collection, and I am sure any fan of this movie and the series would have happily paid twice this for the movie in HD.\n",
      "This was a great movie, came in on time and DVD and casing were undamaged as stated. Great addition to my collection.\n",
      "I think he would have been happy. Perhaps, despite his wonderful imagination trained by the best stories in the world, would not have enabled him to know what could some day be done with film. Perhaps some day there will even be a remake that will be better! But it will be a long time in coming. This production uses the best in everything it touches. The book is honored by an honest attempt to depict it as it is. Aslan is not too big, nor too small. The White Witch is beautifully done. Kids are going to enjoy this movie and parents will have a wonderful time relating the meaning of the movie to their children. There is deep magic in this movie. If anything, the one fault with it is that it makes us want too much to go into our own wardrobe and stay there.By the way, do not leave the theater when the credits start to run! There is more film left and you will miss it or find yourself standing in a crowd at the back of the theater trying to watch it over everyone's head.Additional comments with the release of the DVD:Besides the comments I have on the movie, this edition containing the interviews, especially with the kids, is a wonderful way to enrich the experience. I note also how the same approach has been taken, for example, with the cast of the Harry Potter movies on the DVD editions, that this introduces a whole new aspect to the art form of movie production. Getting to know how the artists feel about their work. The kids are especially interesting and I notice how they all seem so loveable and bright. Is this a requirement for child actorship? Or is this another part of the packaging and marketing of the movies?Either way, it makes the CSL collection richer.\n",
      "wow! awesome story, beautiful.  highly recommended and also, for the Biblical insights, purchase ROAR (book) from amazon.com.  must see.\n",
      "First the movie: It's a pretty faithful adaptation of Lewis' novel.  There are minor changes but nothing major.  Acting is decent, direction is good, and the special effects are outstanding. The novel was a remarkable children's story of redemption and salvation, and the filmmakers avoided simplifying it or softening some of the harder edges.  There isn't blood and gore, but there are still fairly intense battle scenes.  Great movie for families (and I do mean families, not just kids).  It's got a story most children will relate to (wicked witches, annoying siblings, events that they can't entirely control), and it's got enough meat on it to satisfy adults as well. There's isn't any vulgarity or nudity or anything like that, although the battle scenes may be a bit scary for very young kids.The transfer quality was outstanding; this was the first movie I purchased on blu-ray and man oh man, was it a good choice :) Notably better than the DVD on my set (50\" 1080p samsung plasma).\n",
      "I admit that going into the theater I was skeptical.  Could Disney possibly handle the allegorical elements of Lewis' work with the necessary care?  Would the movie be missing any core scenes?  The trailers I had seen seemed to indicate that some things would be changed...and for the worse.My fears, it would appear, were for naught.  Not only is the movie ENTIRELY true to Lewis' story AND allegory....it also manages to be as cinematically engaging as anything else I've recently seen.  Not only that...it accomplishes all of this without the slightest profanity or drop of blood; this movie, like the book, has a heart of gold and should make for great family fare. Detailed breakdown as follows:ACTING: For a movie with 4 kid/teen actors as the main characters, the acting was surprisingly good.  Give me any one of these four over Dakota Fanning.  It's good that the acting worked, too, because here is a story that wouldn't work without it.  The rest of the cast is equally fantastic: Jim Broadbent plays a very endearing professor, Liam Neeson voices the all-important Aslan, and Tilda Swinton (think Gabrielle from Constantine) plays a very dislikeable White Queen.STORY:  How much or how little a viewer gets out of the storywill depend on how familiar they are with its Christian allegory aspects.  So many scenes and lines are handled with the proper emotional deference considering what lies behind the surface story.  Lewis' depiction of Christ as Aslan and Satan as the White Witch is timeless.  There is just so much emotion here in this movie that draws upon these two metaphors.  SPECIFIC SPOILER:  For instance, there is a scene where one animal excitedly asks another animal \"So what is Aslan like!?\"...the animal replies with a joyful expression, \"He's everything we've hoped he is and more.\"  The sincerity and joy of this line is simply SO RIGHT when we consider that, in fact, he's talking about Christ.  That's the joy that the angels and some followers of Christ express over meeting Him and being with Him.While the movie is very loyal to the books, there are also a few scenes added on.  Surprisingly, these scenes work very well and add a bit more depth to the story.The movie can and will be enjoyed on a non-religious level.  On it's own, it's a heartwarming, and engaging story.  Paired, with it's allegorical elements, however, Narnia is an emotional epic surpassing the Lord of the Rings.SCORE: Amazing.  The score elevates every important scene of the movie without being distracting.CINEMATOGRAPHY:  Like the Harry Potter movies, Narnia features some very impressive fantasy scenery.  Several shots were simply breathtaking.  It's also worthy to note that the battles scenes came off very well.  I went in not expecting to see any good action, but the choreography of the fights was impressive and visceral without being gory.Once Lucy entered the warddrobe, I knew I was in for a great, emotional ride.  I can't say how well Memoirs of a Geisha and King Kong will do, but my money is on Narnia for best movie of the Holiday season.  Don't miss it!\n",
      "As i am a collector, i like to collect these boxed sets and i found this a nice looking collection.\n",
      "In a blink of an eye, my DVD was in my hand.Quick delivery, LOVED IT!Bravo, two thumbs up!\n",
      "I love this movie and i have this blu edition. But i don't have a special edition for this Narnia. When i have chance to get this edition i am so happy. there's have 4 disc and 2 figure and it's limited 1,500 for all world.\n",
      "The only reason I bought this particular Narnia DVD was b/c I saw on tv that Disney was going to put it in the vault, so I had to get it before it disappeared and it was a good price for all the special features and everything.  I like the box design, it's very cool.  I love the movie.  Special features are pretty cool if you're that much of a fan, if not, just get the simple DVD.\n",
      "The Exentended version is excellent.Makes you hunger for the forthcomming Prince Caspian. The extended version fills in a lot of the blanks and I recommend heartily.The only drawback was that the booklet accompanying the set was missing and I had to contact Disney to secure it. I am hopeful other editions will have it enclosed.\n",
      "This movie is based on the book of the same title.  The movie fills in some of the original story that is untold.  Very little of the original novel is different from the movie.  The special effects were amazing and breath taking in parts.  While this is a childrens movie, the story line is easy and fun to follow for any age.  This was one of the best movies ever based off a novel.  Viewers do not walk away thinking \"What book was this movie based on?\"\n",
      "This show is really great.  The disks were new as advertized and offered perfect image and sound quality.  This was just as advertized.\n",
      "Classic story and has become a tradition to watch around Halloween and again around Christmas! Jack is the very best!\n",
      "This movie is absolutely fantastic. Classic family movie for anytime of year.I would recommend this movie for all ages to watch. Brings the holiday spirit out in everyone.\n",
      "My 12 year old niece requested this for Christmas and has enjoyed watching it over and over. It is a classic!\n",
      "My little neice is going to love this Christmas present. She likes to be (mildly) scared, and she loves animation.\n",
      "The holidays become a blur.  We've all been accustomed to seeing Christmas music on display well before Halloween has come and gone.  This idea was given full reign in `It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown,' with the late Charles M. Schultz's wonderful take on Halloween when Linus gets mixed up between Santa Claus and the famous, fictitious legend who delivers toys on Halloween night.  This is where Tim Burton's `The Nightmare Before Christmas' takes off, but from there all parallels stop, and flair takes the helm for this truly unique animated adventure.The story is uncomplicated enough.  Jack Skellington (Danny Elfman), an emaciated man who is charming in character and sinister in appearance, is the figure head of Halloweentown, and the key figure of the most anticipated holiday of the village.  November 1st as one might expect, is a let-down, and a down-cast Jack finds himself wandering through a forest all night long.At the end of his journey, he discovers the North Pole and all the inhabitants surrounding Christmas's festive figure, Santa Claus.  Noting that there is something different abound, he goes back to Halloween Town and brings all he sees back to the people.  Feeling inadequate to convey the warmth of the season, he plots with three mischievous children to kidnap Ole Saint Nick and have the secrets of gift giving unfold for his town.Embellishing the story are some offbeat characters.  Ragdoll Sally (Catherine O'Hara) is captive to the nasty Dr. Finkelstein (William Hickey) in a Rapunzel-like subplot.`The Nightmare Before Christmas' could have been a one note wonder, but what I like about it is the charm factor.  In the midst of a cute and macabre background (I'd never thought that would mix until seeing this film.), delightful songs and memorable characters fill the screen.  It doesn't exactly come off like Lucille Ball singing \"We Need a Little Christmas,\" but the sojourn from a dark world yearning to be lighter is worth taking indeed.A J.P.'s Pick 5 *'s =ExceptionalHappy Halloween! ;>)\n",
      "This is one of Burton's BEST! A classic X-Mas/Halloween flick anyone & everyone will enjoy.This flick is about Jack, a skeleton/pumpkin king that lives in.. (DUH!) Halloween Town along with many other frightening Halloween characters.Every Halloween it's always the same to Jack. The Halloweeners in town gather for a celebration as done in the various years. This particular year, however, Jack stumbles across Holiday Doors, and learns about Christmas. Jack, so inspired by this new & interesting place, decides to give Santa a brake for that year and turns Christmas Halloween style.With memorable characters and songs, you'll totally LOVE this movie!!!!!!!!\n",
      "My adult children like this movie.  If you enjoy Tim Burton movies you like this one. Really wouldn't recommend for younger children.\n",
      "wellllllllllllll.the guys from halloween land go to x-mas land and kidnap santa and do x-masup thier own way.its animated or something so no stars per say.this one is for some kids and not for others.the sensitive types need to be in bed.it is another one of tim burtons abselute masterpieces.there are basicly 2 kinds of movies.your julia robetrs-sell out-hollywood-junk and movies that actualy required some thought.so anyone with an imagination will like it.this is themost over the top and wild x-mas movie ever.\n",
      "I just started thinking of this movie today and now I can't wait to go home and watch it again!! My whole family just loves it--from my 4 yr. old  granddaughter to my 57 year old husband. It is so imaginative and exciting  to watch. You can't predict what's going to happen next, you just have to  watch and listen. The music's great, the animation is spectacular. I'd  recommend it to every family.\n",
      "In the non-Blu-Ray world, some of us have to look hard to find extras. If you even remotely like this film..get this version! It's moderately priced, and the extras are like getting a 2nd disc! The digital remastering has it looking even more sensational than it already was..oh, did I mention the extras?\n",
      "Includes \"Uncut-Frankenweenie\" And the real director of the movie's commentary. This will set next to your 3D version, or your restored version.\n",
      "My daughter has gone through one video and two dvd's of this - This was one of her chirstmas presents and she's watched this movie about twenty thousand times.  She is a big Tim burton fan.  I liek the movie, but I don't think I'll be watching Jack Skellington anytime soon.\n",
      "If your second guessing this movie, this movie is simply fantastic. It's a must see, you will find yourself feeling for Jack as he goes on his quest for something differnt in his life. The music and songs are addictive. Oogie Boogie is great also....a gambling \"Boogie man\". One of my favorites.\n",
      "This movie is full of so much magic and creativity, it's truly amzing that Tim Burton has made something so... wonderful! It's always a pleasure to see the opening credits through to the ending. Each scene in this brings you a special gift that makes you very interested in this work of art!You can feel mixed emotions while watching this. It's very interesting because it's a dark and magical story that is fun to watch at either Halloween time or Christmas time, or if you're like me, anytime! It's great to see and witness a fairy tale-like story as beautiful as this one! It's funny, creepy, heart-warming, and darkly magical. Great for kids, teens, and adults, it's a wonderful classic!\n",
      "This is one of the better conversions I've seen. Watched it on a Sharp 90\" lcd and it's really fantastic. The digital copy is a bummer, some people want to watch it on full size screens and not just mobile devices, but oh well. Someday they'll 'get it'\n",
      "Awesome , didnt have to wait. Good quality.  I like the fact that the movies dont take up riom on my hard drive.\n",
      "My wife is a huge Tim Burton fan, and loved having this for a Christmas present.  We still watch it from time to time.\n",
      "Wonderful movie by Tim Burton. May be a little scary or hard to follow for kids under 4, but they may like the music. My 3 year old daughter had lots of questions and hid under her blanket a few times, but she sung the \"This is Halloween\" song for weeks. Definitely needs to be in your Movie Library.\n",
      "This is one of my all-time favorites. I know the movie word-for-word. I don't own this particular movie set but I have the other DVD set (which also comes with 3 discs). I plan on buying this one for Decoration purposes as well as getting my original VHS of the movie back from my mother (she kept it after she bought me the DVD). I am a devoted collector of ALL Tim Burton items. I absolutely love him and his creativity.\n",
      "the effects in this movie were exceptional, funny characters & to see other holidays incorporated in the film made it a classic.\n",
      "This came in RECORD time, less than 2 days after I ordered it.  This  movie is so cute and in combination with the Monopoly game of the same, this will make a great Christmas present.  So glad that I found the Monopoly game here too.\n",
      "I was so nervous about purchasing something used from someone I did not know, but the DVD came within a few days and it is in EXCELLENT condition. Thank you so much!\n",
      "Can you remeber your frist time seeing this in the theatre? can you remeber the 1st copy you brought home?  If yhes to both any wonder why its so BIG!!  Tim Burton thank you for all you have made and done but thank you the most for this !\n",
      "This movie is so cute and entertaining.  It also arrived when it was supposed to without any problems.  I would recommend this movie to both adults and older children.\n",
      "Just sat down to watch this again (on Bluray ;) as its getting near Christmas. My love for this film only grows year on year :).\n",
      "The movie is a classic that we watch every year at Halloween. This year we were traveling and decided to go for Amazon streaming video and were disappointed with slow buffering and freeze frames during the movie but the film itself was great.\n",
      "The Nightmare before Christmas is my favorite movie of all time. I previously had the DVD and decided to upgrade to the Blu Ray and am glad I did. The movies colors are more vibrant and most importantly the backgrounds are a deep black rather than the slightly grey hint seen in the Blu Ray. The sound is more vivid and the whole experience is enhanced by switching to Blu Ray.\n",
      "This movie is a great classic for the gothic community. It's dark, funny, and doesn't take too much brain power to appreciate it. Being a Disney movie, of course it has a simple love story hidden within the chaos, but it isn't as sappy as the usual love story goes. It's actually quite refreshing.Overall The Nightmare Before Christmas is simply fun. It shows how one should appreciate the small things in life and how you should always be yourself.\n",
      "It was an excellent value including bluray,dvd and 3d versions.however the 3d version lacks Spanish dialogue which is only included in the dvd version. The item description did not reflect this and I had purchased this for my dual language class.\n",
      "It's no secret that the majority of Europeans see American cultural import as something highly entertaining but not very complex and sophisticated. The plots are simplistic, the characters lacking individuality,etc. I am not talking here about the well-known masterpieces but the everyday  Hollywood produce make this opinion well-deserved. On the other hand  today's European cinema is often anemic and uninspired. Of course I  generalize but for the most part it's true.Living in Moscow I try to get  the best of both worlds and in The Nightmare Before Christmas I found  something that can be called flawless. It's very entertaining, the music is  the classic of the genre, the visuals are just unbelievable! It's complex,  it's fun, it's perfect in form and content. Frankly, you can hardly expect  all that from the American animation industry lately represented by  Anastasia, The Hercules and other sodomizations of the world history. So  the Nightmare's team did a great job of creating this surprisingly original  piece of art.The main idea are the perspectives of communication between  the worlds that are so much different.  What happens if one of them come  uninvited to visit the other with the best intentions and gifts designed to  please. The result is far from idyllic.What happens if the extraordinary  person is tired of his world and thinks that the real life is elsewhere. So  he travels abroad and finally finds the happiness at home.It's strange  that some of the reviewers consider the Haloween creatures too violent.  They are no more violent that Maurice Sendac's Wild Things or the monsters  our children like to invent when they exchage the self-made horror  stories.The portrayal of children of the Halloween Town is very accurate  - the little ones are unexhaustable, inventive and ready to do anything  just to see what comes out of it- just like my 7-year old son.So this  DVD is an ideal investment and do not regret.\n",
      "This is one of the must have movies of our time (Teens & Adults!!) The claymation is revolutionary!\n",
      "This film was probably one of my favorites of all time. the animation was fantastic for it's time and the writing and humor blew me away. the renting rate was good, as it allowed me to watch this film form home.\n",
      "bought it used and it plays like new...i like the fact that this still holds to the original \"Touch stone\" pictures studios rather than the \"Disney\" brand, So its just like i remeber it being when i first saw it when i was a kid back in 1993.\n",
      "a movie you can watch for both Christmas and Halloween.  funny wonderful seasonal movie.  some features.  this movie if i am not mistaken is made from clay full of action.\n",
      "This is the best movie ofd be  all time, what more could be said!\n",
      "this is my ultimate favorite movie , its the movie i could watch any day , any time and still not get sick of it. i think ive seen it 40000000,00000 times haha. if you havent see this movie GO SEE IT NOW. its a beautiful story of romance ( morbid but sweet ) and hopes and dreams.\n",
      "this is an amazing movie! it has been my favorite since i was a kid and on dvd it looks so much better! the only downside is th digital copy wont work on microsoft zune mp3 players only itunes and microsoft compatiable devices. ( i dont know why it wont work with zune but it wont)but if thats not what your buying it for i would highly recomend this move to anyone!\n",
      "We rented this for the kids to watch the day before Halloween.  Besides being a great movie and a lot of fun for the family, the quality of the video was fantastic.  This was our first Amazon rental, which we watched with our Roku device.  I couldn't have been happier with the picture quality and will not hesitate to rent from Amazon again.  And yes, that pumpkin song is still stuck in my head.\n",
      "This movie is excellent, and love Tim Burton's film. Great movie for kids and adults, very educational. Animation is awesome and very realistic. Would recommend for the entire family."
