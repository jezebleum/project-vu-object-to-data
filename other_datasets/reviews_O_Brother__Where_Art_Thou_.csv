B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1ALOIPRR8Q06J	"2 cents ""meaningless memes"""	"Cable TV classic. Often brings my channel surfing to a halt. Thumbs up to the performers and to those amazing filmmakers, the Coen Brothers. In particular George Clonney. He needs his Dapper Dan promade and when he says, ""We're in a real tight spot"" I care. John Turturro can't suc. Blake Nelson looks and sounds just right for the part. And John Goodman is terrific _as always_. The much ballyhooed about soundtrack is pretty good, but I agree that the 1927 Harry McClintock version of ""Big Rock Candy Mountain"" *by far* is the definite highlight. I felt vindicated when I read influential music/culture critic Greil Marcus say the same. LOVE that song! Marcus says ""Big Rock Candy Mountain"" by Harry should have been on the landmark ""Anthology of American Folk Music"". Btw, since I mention Marcus he hits the nail on the head here as regards the soundtrack: ""it's no surprise the album reached so many people so strongly--if you don't know this music, it's like doors in a mountain opening, and you can't help but want to go inside. It's an old-timey version of The Harder They Come soundtrack, and there's as much to discover in a more-where-this-came-from sense as there was there"". Right.So yeah, as you may notice, it ain't ""Fargo"". But then what is? Well I was just thinking about this movie. I was not that impressed by it when I first saw it. But you know, I can't put my finger on **why**. And that is bothersome. Too high expectations? No. I didn't have many expectations one way or the other. Was it the, to my mind anyhow, - excessive buzz around it. Hmmm. That may have played a part. You just hear too much about somethan and it somehow takes away form the impact. You, without realizing it, end up a little turned off. It's like, ""that's it?"". That's what all the fuss is about?But now I love ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"". The Coen Brothers make me proud to be an American."	4.0	fun little odyssey	2009-07-12	2	1	1
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1AIFT1343QX2N	"""33flavors"""	The Coen brothers strike again! This wonderfully refreshing movie rates high on my list of favorites. It's an off-beat comedy filled with intelligent humor, gifted actors, and flavorful cinematography. The characters played by Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro provide wonderful contrast to the perfectly-cast George Clooney as the know-it-all petty criminal. I laughed from beginning to end!	5.0	One of the best!	2001-12-28	3	3	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	AYQY3RB33F4J6	3rdeadly3rd	"""O Brother Where Art Thou"" is that rare beast, a film which can be enjoyed on a great many levels and constantly yields new treasures each time it is watched.The plot revolves around the escapades of three depression-era prison escapees (led by George Clooney in a command performance as the born-to-lead Ulysses Everett MacGill) as they attempt to track down the proceeds of a robbery.  As with so many quality comedies, however, that is merely the idea which starts the ball rolling. The plot also involves political machinations, love, religion, the Klan and musical interludes - in short, it has everything.Much of the humour is - on the surface - derived from the southern accents of the characters and their ways of dealing with the hardships of the era (with the stew being a good example of this). A secondary source of humour comes from Clooney's attempts at sounding well-educated and his constant observations on what's going on - there's also the requisite catchphrase (in this case ""we're in a tight spot"") which never fails to get a laugh.""O Brother"" also takes some of its cues from slapstick and farce. The climactic scenes as our heroes invade first a Klan rally and then a political banquet clearly give more than a nod to Leslie Nielsen's ""Naked Gun"" series and indeed any other madcap comedy every made. Even this larger-than-life comedy is essentially character driven, which in my opinion makes it slightly a cut above the average.There is also a third level to this film. Throughout the action, various references are made to Homer's Greek epic ""The Odyssey"" - ranging from Cyclopses to Sirens. Certainly the viewing experience is enhanced by reviewing the events of Homer's poem before watching, but this is not essential by anyone's way of thinking.As has been said by a great many reviewers before and no doubt will be again, ""O Brother"" enjoys a strong relationship with its soundtrack. All of the songs and instrumental pieces performed in the film make their way onto the soundtrack in the form in which they appear - with the added fact that ""Po Lazarus"" (the song of the prisoners at the very beginning of the film) is present as a field recording from the 1950s.The music in the film is vital to the plot, as Clooney and his two friends come across a bluesman (Chris Thomas King) who has sold his soul to the devil, a reference to Robert Johnson. As this young man - Tommy Johnson - puts it ""well...I wasn't usin' it"". The foursome then record a version of ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" which becomes a considerable hit. Their appearance - uninvited - at the political banquet on the eve of the gubernatorial election results in the performance both of ""In The Jailhouse Now"" and a fuller-bodied version of ""Constant Sorrow"". Of course, listening to either of these songs on the soundtrack in light of the events surrounding them - especially Clooney's reaction to the striking up of ""Constant Sorrow"" -  on the film becomes a much funnier experience.While not to take anything away from the film itself, there are one or two slight problems in watching it. The first is that some of the scenes don't appear to be adquately miked in the earlier sections of the film - especially the scene where the three escapees are eating dinner at the run-down farmhouse. This has the effect of obscuring some of the very clever dialogue of those sections. The second minor problem is that it does not adequately resolve all the issues raised - such as the identity of the police chief and the exact state of Clooney's marriage. This may, of course, be a deliberately vague thing on the Coen brothers' part, either to set the film up for a sequel (which is unlikely, considering both that there was no sequel to ""The Odyssey"" and that any sequel would almost invariably be not as good as this original) or simply to provoke questions in the minds of the viewers, which it certainly does.Most assuredly, though, this is one of the great films of the 90s and is well worth a viewing by anyone interested in good comedy, entertainment for the intellect or good filmmaking. Congratulations to the Coen brothers on another great success."	5.0	An Absolute Masterpiece	2002-09-25	7	5	2

After i saw the movie however, i was SOOO satisifed. I absolutely LOVED this movie and i would recommend it to anyone.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2S166WSCFIFP5	"adead_poet@hotmail.com ""adead_poet@hotmail.com"""	"What the Coen brothers have created here is a film that is going to last. It quickly made it into my list of top ten movies. It's the Depression-era story of three escaped convicts and their journey to redemption. And along the way they face many trials and tribulations. It's no wonder the story is such a good one, since the film is based on Homer's classic poem, The Odyssey (which the Coen brothers claim to never have read. I don't know that I believe them, but I suppose they could have read the Cliff's Notes).  George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson do a fabulous job as the leads. And John Goodman and Holly Hunter have wonderful supporting roles. The music in this film takes on the aspect of a character. And while I wouldn't call this a musical, song occurs and affects what is going on--and it occurs in the logical places instead of the characters just breaking into song whenever. In fact, I think the soundtrack made a bigger splash than the film (but give it time, I think that people will begin to realize the importance of this film soon enough). Color and the visual style of the film also takes on the aspects of being its own character. I know that the entire film was put through a digital workshop in order to give it the visual feel the Coen brothers wanted. This movie is destined to be one of the all time greats.Unfortunately the dvd doesn't contain a commentary by the Coens or the stars. It is a shame, because I think a Coen commentary would have helped to round out this dvd perfectly. There is a behind the scenes featurette and a featurette that discusses the post-production digital process, both of which are good. There is a menu option that allows you to compare the storyboard with the completed scene (of the Klan scene and the final scene). And finally there is the ""I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow"" music video that helps to complete the dvd. It's a charming video.This is a film I've already seen a dozen times and will continue to watch as time goes on."	5.0	a modern classic	2002-09-10	7	6	1

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	ASC5CH6RALOHL	"Alden Utter ""nedlum"""	"In O Brother, Where Art Thou?, the Cohen Brothers have given us a joyful pageant of incredible wit, unforgettable characters, and indescribable music. The film takes place in a mythical South during the Great Depression, where the Klan lynches with impunity, politicians campaign with midgets, and the best way to get a car is through grand theft auto. Everett, a long winded man addicted to one brand of hair gel, has broken out of jail with the men he was, by chance, chained to: Pete, trusting and loyal, and Delmar, dull, yet kind-hearted. Together, they set out across the land, to reach the treasure that Everett had stolen before a dam flooded the land where it was buried. But that is just the pretext. Along the way, there are baptisms, arguments, a betrayal or two, near lynching, the sale of souls, and an end encounter with the sherriff... and something more. I won't say who, but keep your ears open. It is wonderfully subtle, but when you know who he truly is... It's powerful. That subtle hint is one of the many signs of genius present throughout this film.Of course, the singing is justifiably one of the best known and best loved parts of the film. Although Disney seems to have currently stepped out of the ring, O Brother proves that musicals are still a delightful form of movie. From the opening credits and ""Big Rock Candy Mountain"", to the haunting rendition of ""Oh, Death"" at the Klan Rally, up until the prophet's singing of ""Angel Band"" as he rolls toward the horizonThe characters are rich, one and all. Everett's commentary on why a blind man with no name would have trouble finding work, Delmar's remark that while Pete would be 84 when leaving prison, ""I'll only be 82."" , and Pete's apologizing to God before betraying his friends, reflect wonderful characters rare to find in any medium, created in a labor of love . And not just the main ones: from the incompetent election officials, to George Nelson, each character becomes unforgettable, instead of the vague stereotype all too common in films.As for the wit... well, as Pappy O'Daniel says, there's no accounting for taste. But from Delmar's repetitive offering of a roasted gopher to Everett to the exclamation in the midst of the haunting Klan rally that ""The color guard is colored!"" the rich dialogue and wonderful sight gags (i.e. the sheer amount of Dapper Dan Everett uses, seen at the end) lighten the darkest scene, and further show the honed Craft of the Cohen'sIn short, O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a joy of a film. With a rich world brought to life, it is one of the finest films to grace the silver screen."	5.0	Seek this Treasure	2002-07-11	4	4	0

Its pretty funny, but there was really no plot.  In one scene the 3 fugitives see these ladies who start singing and seducing them.  In my teenage perspective, I don't want to see some old dudes being seduced by beautiful women. (George Clooney is hot though)  I was laughing a lot of the time, but I did not understand this at all.  Every couple of minutes I was like, where did this dude come from?

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2JUR4XQAHSXT6	Amazon Customer	On 18 Feb  04, at 11:30 p.m., I watched the movie O Brother Where Art Thou.  I watched it played on a DVD medium in surround sound.  This film was produced by Touch stone / Universal pictures with help from Studio Canal and Working Title Productions.  The movie was made in 2000 and stared George Clooney in the title role.  His supporting cast was John Turturro and Tim Blake.  This film was presented in color.O Brother is a partially modernize story of Odysseus.  In this case the character George Clooney plays is called Ulysses Everett or Everett for shot.  He is on a chain gang and needs to get home.  He convinces his fellow convicts, Pete and Nelson, to escape with him.  Everett says he has stolen a million dollars and needs to get it before the valley he buried it in is flooded.  This will happen in five days, so the unlikely trio races against the clock to get home.Along the way the encounter several diversions that try to keep them from getting their prize.  First  the jump a train or at least a few of them do.  However since they are chained together they all fall out of the train.  They need to learn to work together, if they are going to make it to the money in time.Next they meet a blind man on a hand cart.  He prophesizes that they will find a treasure, but not the one they seek.  This causes some dissent among the men.  However Everett is able to keep them together and push them on.After the encounter with the blind prophet, they run into Pete's Cousin.  Hogwolop turns the three in for the bounty.  The depression is very severe and Hogwolop needs the money to save his farm.  The three are able to escape.The boys run into a baptism.  Pete and Nelson get saved but Everett decides not to. The two saved boys are ready to call it quits.  I think this parallels the encounter with the lotus eaters.  Instead of physical pleasure, the boys have a spiritual pleasure.  As such they feel that they have been absolved from sin.  Why should they move on?  Everett pushes them.They run into a black guitar player.  He tells them that they can make some money singing into a can.  They cut a record and this act gets them famous.  Even though the Soggy Bottom boys, as they are now called, do not realize it.There is an encounter with three women.  When they wake up Pete is gone and the boys think he has been turned into a frog.  Everett pushes them on.After the encounter with the three sirens they run into a one eyed bible sales man.  Big Ted tricks them into going out into the woods for lunch.  Then he kills the frog that is Pete, beats up Nelson and Everett  and then robs them.  This is a close parallel to the encounter with the Cyclops in the Odyssey.  After several more adventures they meet the Cyclopes again.  This time they defeat him.  First they attempt to spear his eye with a rebel flag.  But in the end they  land a fiery cross on top of him.There is an encounter with a suitor in the later half of the movie.  This time Everett is not the strong one and he gets his but kicked.  He has to learn that an all out attack is hopeless.  So Everett disguises himself and his buddies to sneak into a political rally and see Everett's wife.  The real reason he escaped from jail.  You find out that there is not treasure.  Everett just said that to get his chain boys to leave with him.  His wife is about to get remarried and he will do anything to stop it.  In the end, the boys get a pardon, the get new jobs, and Everett gets the girl.As for an evaluation.  I do not like George Clooney.  I think he is an arrogant actor that always seams oily.  As such this tainted my perception of the movie.  But I didn't like it just for Clooney's miserable performance.  No I didn't like it because of all the Yodeling.  I did not care for the time period or the jandra this movie was designed for.  The constant caterwauling was not music.  It was noise.  As such I could not get into the main part of the story.  Their concept that music can save ones soul.I am also nit picker when it comes to period concepts in films.  As such I was irritated that a rebel flag was used for the KKK, as their symbol, in the film.  The actual rebel flag was not adopted by the clan until the end of the second world war.  As such it should not have been used at all.  Now IK must say that I thought that their portrayal of the country store was accurate.  It wasn't until the advent of the super market that customers could actually get products themselves off of the shelves.  You needed an attendant.  This was a nice vintage touch.This is a modern rendition of the Odyssey.  However, except for a few obvious parts, the sirens and the Cyclops, I couldn't make the connection.  If you can compare O Brother Where Art Thou to The Odyssey then by all means you can compare What Dreams May Come to Dante's Inferno .Like I have stated it was a stretch.  Also I just felt the acting was lack luster and the plot was forced.  All types of little things kept happening to the convicts that pushed them along in the right direction and rewarded them.  These are prisoners.  It is hard to sympathize with them.  Yes you learn that they did their crimes for good causes, but the fact of the matter is the movie was glorifying the prisoner.  This upset me.  We have enough problems now a days without some idiot getting an idea that it is okay to be like baby face nelson and go out in a criminal ball of glory.  Morally I was opposed to this.As for the DVD the features were lacking.  I'm used to tons of extras and this DVD had little to offer.  For $15.00 I expect more for my money.  All in all I was extremely disappointed in both the film and the DVD.  I'm glad I only spent $2.62 to rent it.  Even then I felt cheated.Safe journey:David	1.0	This is not the Ulysses	2004-08-16	67	9	58

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2KLXBV2LAH5FF	andrew boudreau	What boggles the mind when reading the first page of reviews is that not a single person has mentioned that the entire movie is based off of an intellectual staple in the literaty world, Homer's Odyssey.  Sure it was a great portraite of the American south during the depression, but the cleverness of weaving such an intelectuals story into an accurate historcal comedy/drama is astounding.  This was a plot of pure wit, and each scene had its equil in the epic peom.  See or buy this movie if you are one who enjoys the pleasures of the intelectual pursuit.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	Love them or hate them, the Coen brothers know how to get your attention.  For me, this is surely one of their best films, and it is one that I have grown to love (considerably) over the years.  It sports Clooney's best performance to date (seriously) and one of the smartest scripts of the decade (or forever), using the powerful `Odyssey' as comic relief.  The humor is strictly `Coen' style, which is why it may not be ideal for everyone, but you can't help but totally respect what they were able to do here.I mean, this is genius, whether you `like' it or not.Set in the 1930's, `O Brother, Where Art Thou' tells of the adventures of three escaped convicts (Everett, Pete and Delmar), as they search for hidden treasure.  In true `Homer' fashion, the three convicts come across a slew of strange character that play a central part in their journey (including a brilliantly realized side-plot involving the KKK).The film reeks of style, period drama brilliance oozing from every nook and cranny of the film.  The comedic timing is flawless, and it is one of those films that really helps establish a star.  A lot of people make claim that George Clooney is a great actor, and while I like him, I find that he was certainly better `before' he became big.  His star persona skyrocketed in 2005 after he garnered Oscar nominations for his action (which he won for) and his directing, but his early 00 work is far better than what he's been putting out as of late.  His work in this film, as well as `The Perfect Storm' and `Solaris', is some of his best work ever.  I find that I appreciate George as a comedic actor over a dramatic one, his that is why his performance in `O Brother, Where Art Thou?' will remain my favorite work from him, ever.The film retains an avenue of suspense, which only helps sell the comedic overtones (think `Fargo', which would have been pointless without the dramatic underlining).  This is a stunning example of what the Coen brothers are capable of, and why they will be remembered as one of those directorial pairs that helped shape the way we look at cinema.Funny, charming, dark, mysterious; full of breathtaking cinematography, appropriate (and catchy) music and memorable performances (John Goodman, a Coen staple, is magnificent as always), `O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is a film you won't soon forget.	5.0	O Brother, what a great movie!	2010-03-02	4	4	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A24GT7TN3L7IB8	"""angelgold99"""	If you're as big a Coen fan as I am, then you will definitely not want to miss this movie. Joel and Ethan have really outdone themselves this time. Loosely based on Homer's Odyssey, O Brother, Where Art Thou? retains most of the Coens' signature quirkiness, while introducing a few fresh faces to their ragtag bunch (George Clooney and Tim Blake Nelson). But fear not, lifelong fans - the film also contains our much-loved actors John Goodman, John Turturro, Holly Hunter and Charles Durning (who we last saw confined to a wheelchair in The Big Lebowski).Set in 1930s rural Mississippi, the movie opens with Clooney, Nelson and Turturro escaping from a chain gang to seek their fortune. The action (and laughs) begin right away, with the boys trying to hop a freight train while still chained together - and it only gets funnier from there. From sirens to sheriffs, the boys go through heaven and hell...but they sure have a great time doing it.As I said before, anyone who is a Coen fan needs to see this movie. However, those whose movie tastes run toward big-budget blockbusters in the tradition of Titanic will probably not enjoy O Brother, Where Art Thou? as much. Still, no matter who you are, the movie is a pretty entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. Do yourself a favor and go rent this movie. Odds are, you'll be back here buying it before too long.	5.0	DO Seek This Treasure	2002-01-28	3	1	2

George Clooney, who plays a fugitive from a chain gang with a dry sense of humor, is excellent as well as his fellow partners in crime, Pete and Delmar.  Ulysses Everett McGill, Clooney's character, makes the movie really funny by the way he is so obsessed with his hair treatment.  He goes through quite a few cans of it because the look of his hair is very important to him.  The movie keeps your attention and goes by fast because each scene is so different and you never know what to expect.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	AWIP29O683JNO	"Anthony Camello ""ynotnyc"""	I must admit I'm a big fan of the Coen brothers.  Such Films as Fargo, The Big Lebowski, Raising Arizona and Millers Crossing are some of my favorites.  Oh Brother Where Art Thou just adds to the list.  George Clooney is great as Everett, the leader of  three escaped cons from a chain gang in search of a hidden treasure.Along the way they stop in at a local radio station to cut a record (&quot;sing into a can&quot;)as the Soggy Bottom Boys for a few dollars.  While they're trying to dodge a ruthless bounty hunter, have a run in with an unscrupulous bible salesman (John Goodman), Baby Face Nelson and the Klan, their song becomes a big hit.I've watched this movie about ten times at least and it gets better and funnier all the time.

A member of a Missouri Bluegrass Band told me this movie is a great showcase for bluegrass.  And it is. But the film lags when the music fades down, although it rises to a super high at a critical moment, a big gathering, where the music of the fugitives even gets the Governor a dancing.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2Y3VGSSH29U9U	"Ari Vander Walde ""avanderw"""	This was by far the best movie I saw this year. In addition to its musical, comedic, and acting merits, I wanted to point out its literary merits, which are slightly underneath the surface but are there nonetheless if you are looking for them.This movie is not merely an adaptation of The Odyssey, it is a very viable literary interpretation of it. Bringing out Ulysses' vanity, self-reliance, and persuasuve ability as well as Penelope's stubbornness and fickle nature, which this film does beautifully, have been important in all interpretations of the classical poem.Satire of the work is also not lost on the Coens. Ulysses is transformed from the sacker of Troy to a fraudulent lawyer, his athletic prowess turns into him getting beaten up by a weakly looking suitor, and even the authors' use of the name Homer is intended and appropriately satiric. (for a full-of-himself politician who looks out for &quot;the little man&quot;)For those who think that this is indeed merely a loose adaptation and that the events and persons of the Odyssey are not put into this movie, I would contend that they are very much mistaken.Without giving anything away, I would challenge viewers to find the Coens' interpretation of all of the following characters from the poem (the first few are easy): Odysseus, Penelope, the Sirens, the Cyclops, Circe (and her turning of Ulysses' men into animals), the Cattle of the Sun, King Alcinous of Phaecia, the angry god Poseidon (who here is also the ruler of Hades), the ghosts of Hades, the Lotus Eaters, Aeolus, the Laestrygonians, Alcinous' blind bard Demodocus, Eurylochus (Ulysses' unfaithful first-mate), Elpenor (his man who he meets in Hades), Telemachus, and Eumaeus the swineherd, Tiresias (the blind seer of Hades), the suitors Eurymachus and Antinous, and finally the representations of the monstrous Scylla and the water guzzling Charybdis.They are all there. I'm not making them up. Watch the movie again if you have to. Good luck and enjoy!	5.0	&quot;I reckon we haven't seen the last of old George&quot;	2001-06-22	0	0	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2C27IQUH9N1Z	audrey	I would rank this film as one of the Coen Brothers' best.  The premise (of relating Homer's Odyssey as the 1937 story of an escaped convict's journey to prevent his ex-wife from remarrying) is interesting, the dialogue is clever throughout, the cast is wonderful, and the music adds immeasurably to the entertainment.Of special note, the Coens have been exceedingly generous in the extras offered to those who see the DVD.  A behind-the-scenes presentation features interviews and observations from the brothers as well as major actors and technical people; a music video of the breakaway single &quot;A Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;; a documentary about the unique digital colorization techniques used for the film; and (my favorite) three scenes which can be run as a simulcast of the film with storyboard panels.  The cinematography and sets are beautiful.This is what a DVD package *should* be!  If you like the Coen Brothers' previous work you should love this.  If you are interested in film as a creative endeavor, you will probably enjoy the film and the informative and fun extras.  If you like comedy and good music, it would be worth your while to take a chance on this very enjoyable film.	5.0	terrific movie with lots of bells and whistles on the DVD	2001-08-14	5	4	1

Perfection, my friends. Cinematic perfection.As for the Blu-ray disc itself, Amazon shipped it to me in great condition, and the film has simply never looked better.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2929138VN3P6C	B. A. Johnson	O Brother, Where Art Though? managed to revive a style of music many American had never heard before. Its soundtrack has found its way into many homes that it might never have gone before. The fantastic sountrack mangages to compliment a great film though. Knowing the Oddessy on which this story was based helps add some fun to the movie, however, it isn't neccessary. I've found that whereas I know the story of the Oddessy and am able to identify certain characters and similarities, my parents had no such knowledge and I doubt their enjoyment of the film was any less than mine. George Clooney does one of his better film performances in this movie (second to Ocean's 11 perhaps) but it is the plethora of supporting characters and cast that help make this ancient story come to life. If for the sound track alone this movie deserves a reccommendation, but I believe that even without its amazing soundtrack, it would be a phenomenal success.	5.0	Great Movie, Great Soundtrack	2003-06-26	3	0	3
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2S07SYHNQHNYW	Barbara Almaraz	"An amazing movie, ""Oh Brother where art thou"" is a classic unto itself.  Stunning cinematography ad incredible acting, the movie draws you into a web and refuses to let you go until the very ending.  Based on Homer's Odyssey with a southern twist, George Clooney, John Turturo and Tim Blake Nelson make an unforgettable trio of prison escapees making their way back home and encountering the trials and tribulations on their adventure.  There are parts that will make you laugh until you cry and there are parts that will make you misty-eyed.  In an age of that has seen seven Saw  movies, remakes of everything, and soon to be three Transformers movies, Oh Brother where art thou gives the viewer some much needed intellectual respect."	4.0	Some much needed intellectual respect	2010-12-27	3	3	0

I may have laughed once...may have.  All of the actors were very good, Clooney excelled and Blake's facial expressions were precious, but the movie did not pull the me in.  I wanted to like it and tried to do so.  This movie just does not tell the story effectively.  If it did, I would have cared when one of the characters was getting whipped.  I should have been impressed with the ending catastrophe, but wasn't.  And John Goodman's appearance is an insult to his talent.

To take up time? Must have been, because they had absolutely no impact or relationship to the action of the movie. Their presence was totally random.I thought that the entire film made fun of the South and Southerners (and no, I am not one). And what was the point of the cow being hit by a car? That was cruel and thoughtless. Did they think it was funny?The sepia cinematography was gorgeous.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3LNY0DG3DYFOW	"Betty ""Genealogy Junkie"""	"""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a 20th-century version of Homer's epic poem ""The Odyssey"".The story focuses on three escaped prison-farm inmates who face a series of overwhelming odds in their effort to ""seek the treasure"" buried on the homeplace of the gang's self-appointed leader (played by George Clooney). A side impediment is Clooney's on-going effort to procure a tin of ""Dapper Dan"" hair pomade. His pompous ""I'm a 'Dapper Dan' man"" means he will not settle for a lesser brand.Aside from getting to the treasure, Clooney's character has limited time to get to his hometown before his former wife marries another man.Each disaster causes another delay in reaching the homeplace before it is relegated to the bottom of a brand-new lake.The movie is liberally laced with knee-slapping humor and Depression-era country music (old-time Hillbilly) which is very well-executed (and, with one exception, lip-synched to singers who specialize in that genre). Even this editor, who has a life-long loathing of that kind of music, can't get enough of it!Outstanding scenes include: a comic deep-south politico wonderfully portrayed by the marvelous Charles Durning; a hypnotic vocalization of ""Go to Sleepy Little Baby"" by the three ""sireens"" (sic); his normal outstanding performance by one of this editor's favorite thespians, John Goodman; and a blood-chilling KKK lynch-mob scene, the choreography for which can rival a Rockettes performance.This is a motion picture most will enjoy watching any time and often!"	4.0	O Brother, Where Art Thou?

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A9ETDX5K04DY	"Billy J. Hobbs ""Bill Hobbs"""	I haven't seen many films in recent memory that I am so impressed by as the one I just watched this evening.  &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou&quot; is brilliant, not a word I use in reference to many American films.  Truly, the Coen Brothers are cinematic geniuses I now acknowledge!  &quot;Fargo&quot; was excellent, but not great as this one is.  I didn't see all five nominated films for Best Picture this year, but I cannot believe that ANY one was superior to this one.  Granted, the Coens were not marketing the film to the usual 14-year-old money-making mentality of most of the recent blockbuster American films, but  in its comedic brilliance, the Brothers skirt thither and yon with articulation rarely seen; they combine the best nuances of the Foreign Film with the power that American films can (but usually don't) produce.  The clever literary allusions crocheted tantalizingly with Southern Depression lore was excruciatingly&quot;to the point,&quot; and with refreshing originality (another rarity in Hollywood)!  And George Clooney--who'd have thought he could pull off such a role (one tends to remember him as that doctor on that tv program) deserved his honors, and, again, I cannot believe whoever it was who won the Oscar did a better job of acting. (Yes, Mr. Crowe, I mean it!)  Yes, the box office won again, which is the downside of American movie awards, it seems.Clooney's two sidekicks hold their own, easily--actually, they do more than that:  they keep Clooney aloft!  Charles Durning, John Goodman, and Holly Hunter merely gild the lily.  Homer, indeed, is impressed, spinning in his grave, as he must be, to see &quot;The Odyssey&quot; in such a new, and invigorating, light.  With all the bravado and the zany activities, the Coens squeeze in, sometimes subtly, sometimes not, more than a few lessons in social significance, yet without preaching.  One doesn't have to be well-versed in this period of American history (although it must help to recognize the  allusions!) to appreciate the film.  Tomorrow I'm even buying the sound track, so remarkable it is.I've long been a critic of American films, as I've felt most were not worth watching, intellectually.  This one is.

The atmosphere created was perfect for what I'd imagine the south was like during the time period portrayed in the movie. There was plenty of beautiful scenery.

I mean they took everything from The Odyssey(Not the space one, the Homer-Illiad one) and made it work in the favor of three guys on a chain gang. Aside from singlehandedly reviving bluegrass the movie does its job to make itself a cult classic to say the least. I guess it's probably worth buying on DVD, but I'm too lazy and until Amazon Prime goes up in price again I'll stick to watching it once a year and listening to the entire soundtrack(just one song a dozen different ways) on my way home from work occasionally.	5.0	It's George Clooney and some other guys reviving a dead music genre.	2014-06-20	0	0	0

I stopped it after watching an hr of it. It put my bestfriend to sleep and almost put me to sleep. The story is way to slow with no plot. The acting sucks. The talking scenes are boring and way too long. There is nothing funny about this movie except for the fact that people actually like it. Which I find surprising. The movie is suppose to be about a trio on chain gang who break from prison is 1930's. They are out on the run to treasure. Along the way, they come across many strange people. Who are way too stupid with very low talent or talent. Which makes this movie very unworthy to watch. I give this movie a 3 out of 10.I'm a HUGE George Clooney fan. I've liked him since seeing him in Return To Horror High in 1987. Just because I don't like this movie, does not mean I'm not a true Clooney fan. A fan does not have to like everything about the person they are a fan of. If there other fans out there who don't like this movie. Please come forward.If you want to see a good George Clooney movie.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2R6Z67JX2T5TQ	Bob Reece	"This movie is all American, great music and heartfelt acting. The critics, and the reviews below, all mention that the film is loosely based on Homer's, ""Odyssey"". A tag line begins the film mentioning the same. In an interview, the Cohen brothers stated they have not read Homer's poem. This makes a lot of sense when one remembers that the tag line for ""Fargo"" states the film is based on a true story; the Cohen brothers later said it is a fictional story.With that said, I have to say that I believe ""Oh Brother..."" is loosely based on the movie, ""The Wizard of Oz.""Think back on these scenes and characters:The bounty hunter is really the wicked witch. When they rescue their friend from the KKK reminds me of the scene when the Tin Man, Scarecrow and Lion rescue Dorothy from the witch's castle. All scenes on the road in ""Oh Brother..."" are tinted a yellowish color; hence follow the yellow brick road. The three characters led by Clooney are not seeking a treasure, but the Wizard to give them a pardon and that Wizard is the Governor. The flood near the end of the film is an analogy to the Tornado. Floating by are old tires, a dog and other items.Next time you watch ""Oh Brother..."" think along these lines and you'll probably find more references to the ""Wizard of Oz."""	4.0	A Tribute to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;	2001-03-19	35	19	16

I absolutely despised the Big Lebowski after the first run in my VCR. But after being stuck with it and stuck without cable on Staten Island... Gave it a couple more shots, and each time the movie got better. &quot;Oh Brother...&quot; is no different. I think it comes down to how willing you are to suspend disbelief-- most can't the first time they see something on the big screen (self included). The lush bluegrass as the perpetual foundation will win over even Public Enemy to DJ Rap fans (read: anyone). No real morals, no real messages (the same stuff heavyweight Mark Twain promised he would take a shot at somebody for expecting)-- just good &quot;old timey&quot; fun.	4.0	Watch it again after your finished scratching your head	2001-08-26	6	4	2

Maybe it was because it was after a long day at work when I watched this, but I couldn't really get into it - it had some wry humor, but overall, I never laughed out loud even once.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A14LIZKKA7WYT9	brigsbmc@cs.com	O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? was one of the best films I saw all year.  Ethan and Joel Coen(FARGO,  THE BIG LEBOWSKI,  RAISING ARIZONA) have written a movie using the ancient story line to The Odyssey and turned it into the tale of a man's determination to escape prison and stop his wife from re-marrying.  The sheer brilliance of this movie deserves an applause.  Set in the Depression Era,  this comedy/musical(if you will) begins with Everett,  Pete,  and Delmar escaping off the chain gang.  Everett has told them that he has buried 1.2 million dollars near his home,  and they must get to it before the land is made into a river.  Thus begins this amazing movie with countless allusions to The Odyssey.  The blind prophet from the story becomes the blind railway man who tells the men they will go on a quest.  Then,  the men are seduced by three women singing,  the Sirens of course.  And who can forget the one-eyed man Big Dan Teague showing the ruthlessness of the Cyclops?  All in all,  this movie's great script(nominated for an Oscar) and awesome performances make this movie great fun.  George Clooney is incredible as Everett,  and this is the role which won him the Golden Globe award for Best Actor, beating out such stars as Mel Gibson,  Robert Deniro,  John Cusack,  and Jim Carrey.  John Turturro is a chameleon,  a brilliant character actor and great in this movie as Pete.  One of the best played roles is that of Delmar,  played by Tim Blake Nelson.  He is a perfect comic relief character and I feel the most likeable of the three.  In the supporting areas,  John Goodman rocks as Big Dan Teague,  and he can now be called somewhat of a Coen Brothers regular,  having been in THE BIG LEBOWSKI and RAISING ARIZONA.  Holly Hunter,  also a Raising Arizona alum plays a perfect and motherly Penny,  Everett's wife.  Charles Durning is a fiery and strong as Guv'nor Pappy O'Daniel,  as are Chris Thomas King and The Practice's Michael Badalucco.  Wayne Duvall is very good as the rival Homer Stokes.  The really wonderful part of this movie is the music.  In a way,  this comedy is somewhat like a musical,  the music carrying the men from one place to another,  and I especially love the scenes in which the three men and their accomp..uhh,  accompanist(It's a joke from the movie,  see it,  and you'll get it) Tommy roll into &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow.&quot;  An awesome Coen Brothers Flick!	5.0	The Coen Brothers are Geniuses!	2001-05-05	11	8	3

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3SOV9HFM5H9T1	Bruce P. Barten	As comedies go, this one is difficult to explain.  George Nelson, while setting a record for the number of banks robbed in two hours, happens to shoot a herd of cows.  The last cow in the movie must represent the idea that the death penalty would be entirely appropriate in that case, and George Nelson is last seen agreeing, but I shouldn't be giving so much away.  The easiest part of this movie to understand is the idea that the main characters could record a hit record.  Life is imitating art on a large scale when the soundtrack itself is a best seller.  Having a hit record becomes so much more important than anything else in the movie, the comedy might seem insignificant.  This is too funny to seem like real history, but it is the perfect commentary on old time anything that might be related to hard times in Mississippi.	5.0	Outrageously great.	2002-03-20	4	4	0

Typically smart, funny dialogue and a unique cast of characters make this a must-buy for fans of the bros. Coen. Joel and Ethan bleach most of the color out of the images, creating a stark, dusty, &quot;antique&quot; feel to the film that really adds a sense of the period it takes place in. I think the best improvement that was made on this DVD was the inclusion of additional material. A good &quot;making of&quot; featurette, and two other really neat items, one being the digital coloring process, the other, a slick storyboard/live action function that allows you to watch two scenes AND the storyboards they're based on at the same time.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	AW3VZ5O895LRK	"carol irvin ""carol irvin"""	I've got to take back an earlier assessment of mine that George Clooney can't act.  He does a wonderful acting job in this movie and no one could have been more suprised than I was to discover him as an actor. Clooney forms a trio, along with John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, of fugitives from a chain gang in Depression era Mississippi. This is the ultimate road movie with characters throughout that could have only come from the Coens' incredible imaginations.  Real life is even interspered throughout with the trio catching a ride, for example, with &quot;Baby Face Nelson,&quot; the notorious manic-depressive bank robber. Ulysses Everett McGill is the name of Clooney's slick con man character and this is because this story is a retelling of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; via the Coen brothers.  Homer and the Coens together are a delightful combination, much more enjoyable than my reading of the source work back in high school.  The soundtrack of music from this era is fabulous too.  Our trio can even sing and makes a impressive debut as the &quot;Soggy Bottom Boys.&quot;  There are so many great scenes in this film that I could go on and on but I'll just highlight a few.  There is a Klu Klux Klan rally musical number that is only rivaled by &quot;Springtime For Hitler&quot; in &quot;The Producers.&quot;  It is a superb music and dance number of the proposed lynching of a black man! Then there is the biblical flood that looms over all but in this case is the creation of the TVA dam.  The Coens manage to make creation of the TVA into high comic film art, no small feat. The trio also runs into the Sirens, just like happens in the epic poem.  In this case they are three damsels washing in the river and singing who beguile the trio.  From this encounter flows the comic wonder of Tim Blake Nelson over his belief that the sirens may have transformed Turturro into a frog. This is a must see film for everyone.	5.0	Coens Make Another Absolutely Wonderful Film!	2001-06-21	0	0	0

Looked like a dumb guy movie.  But these escapees were funny. (And Everett wasn't any smarter than the other two, he just had a bigger vocabulary.)  I was laughing in no time, but my boyfriend was REALLY laughing. I said, ""I know this is funny, but it's not THAT funny"". ""Oh yes it is, when I lived in Oklahoma, I KNEW people like this.""  Delmar is so sweet, he apologized for everone else's mistakes, and butterflies land on his finger.  Poor Pete, everything bad happens to him.  And Everett keeps saying that this time he really is telling the truth. I am not a fan of ""country music"", but I loved all the songs in this, particularly ""Man of Constant Sorrows"" (OMG, loved the silly dancing they did on stage at the end), and the gravediggers song, so moving.  Some of our favorite lines are:""We're in a tight spot""""What line of business are you in? Some of your folding money's come undone.""""I don't want Fop, G*d-d*mm*t, I'm a Dapper-Dan man.""""You watch your language young man, this is a family establishment"".""Yep, they're going to kick our butts"", ""No I think they're going to paddle it""""And stay out of the Woolsworth!""And MY favorite: ""Of course it's Pete, LOOK at him!""I know these are not funny here, but they are really funny in context.This is not an over the top kind of funny, like Lethal Weapon or Dumb and Dumber, it is a subtle kind of funny, like, ""I can't believe these guys are so serious about how ridiculous they're being.""I also like that it has a ""restored and colorized"" look to it. It makes you think they are in some kind of fantasy land. And a lot of the smaller parts are played by people with very interesting faces. They are funny just to look at.I like KKK Scene, it is so reminiscent of when the Scarecrow, Tinman and Lion are breaking into the Witche's Castle. And if you read the script, the KKK is signing ""E-I-E-E-I-O, Eenie, Meenin, Miny, Mo"".Pappy O' Daniel and his Yes Men are too funny too.I think the best part about this movie is that it all seemed so disjointed and fun, and until you got to the end, you had no idea how everything was interrelated.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3AR0CHEIYQB9Q	"C. Artman ""Health Nut"""	We watched this DVD last night, seeing the movie for the first time.  The best part of the movie was its ability to put you into the feel of the south/midwest back in the 1920/1930 depression era.  The movie had a slap-stick-like humor and somewhat corny but very cute dialog.  The best part of the movie, I felt, was the cinematography and dialog, which wonderfully placed one back in the early 1920-1930's.  I did not find the movie very funny, but did find it somewhat 'charming' due to the mood and theme.However, the average IQ of every character in the entire movie did not break double digits.  The slap-stick style humor and consistent monotony of the theme, in my opinion, gets old very quick.Overall, I find this movie fairly charming in its setting and theme, but the slapstick-style humor I did not find very funny.  Much of the time I was very straight faced, often annoyed.  The atmosphere, cinematography, and charm of this movie were its saving graces.	3.0	Great Cinematography, Charming, Slap-Stick With Low IQ	2001-08-05	10	3	7

And who would have thought you could find a Cyclops in Depression-era Mississippi?  This is a great movie:  a great plot, a great script, great acting, a great look and feel, and a great sound track. It's very touching, and really funny.  It's a musical, but not the Rogers and Hammerstein kind -- the characters don't just break into song for no reason.

And the supporting cast - hilarious!  And the soundtrack... sublime.The Coens are cinematographic geniuses at work as well.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A12VNLDP44U0PF	c. cav	To say Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? is loosely based on Homer's Odyssey is to say the Kentucky Derby is loosely related to the chariot scene in Ben Hur.  It's Odysseus, for Cripes sake, not Ulysseus (that's the Roman name for Homer's hero)....  There are more allusions to Le Morte D'Arthur than the Odyssey....ie. the 3 in search of the unattainable--just as Galahad, Percival, and Bors searched for the Holy Grail.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A17N23WXA7EAF	"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter"""	"""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"" is a wonderful film, especially if you accept it on its own terms instead of judging it by any personal preconceptions such as what a depression-era story should say, or how faithful and accurate a modern interpretation of the Odyssey should be. The film has a light-hearted goofiness to be sure, but this is part of its charm and part of what makes it work.Oh Brother is the story of three escaped convicts lead by the garrulous Ulysses Everett McGill. On their way to McGill's buried treasure, the convicts experience the Cohen brothers' twisted and hilarious versions of the blind soothsayer, the sirens, the Cyclops, and other Homeric characters. Both the Homeric characters and ensuing events hardly follow those of the Odyssey itself. In fact, they are more like road markers in the film than elements in the plot structure. In the end, Ulysses' wins his duel with his wife, Penelope's suitors not with physical prowess but with music. These characters are mixed with some Southern legends such as a ""baby faced"" serial bank robber who does it for the thrill and a talented black guitarist who claims to have traded his soul to the devil for his musical gift.Music is in fact the universal current of this film, which begins with a chain gang singing as they break rocks on the side of the road. Music draws the convicts to baptismal ceremonies in the woods and to the treacherous arms of the sirens. It enables them to con money from a blind radio station owner and ultimately proves to be their salvation. Some reviewers have commented that music provides this film with most of its artistic and thematic depth, and I agree with them. Just as the Cohen brothers seem to take their light hearted, Southern stereotypes a little too far, the music reorients us to the fact that these are real people living in a time of intense misery and struggle.Some people may not like this film because the convicts lack depth of character. But I think the convicts are not meant to appeal to us with realism as much as they are a throwback to 30's era films.  There is something fantastic and whimsical about this film but I think this will only bother people who expect the film to take itself seriously. ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"" is an exploration of Homeric themes, Southern culture, the impact of music, and a bygone era of film making. The Cohen brothers chose to do this with ironic whimsy, which may understandably irritate some people, but which worked for me."	5.0	Excellent if you accept it for what it is	2001-06-27	10	9	1
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2PBV1899CX3TE	"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!"""	"""... I figured it should be the one with the capacity for abstract thought...""The Cohen Brothers, Ethan and Joel, have a certain style as co-directors, and they have certain regulars who often turn up in their ensemble casts: John Turturro, Holly Hunter and John Goodman from OBWAT? have been in Cohen Brothers' films before. OBWAT? is similar in some ways to other Cohen Brothers' films such as Fargo, The Big Lebowski, or Raising Arizona, but it stands out, even among Cohen Brothers' films, as a singular achievement. It has been described by them as ""a hay seed Lawrence of Arabia."" It is also a Three Stooges film, with Clooney as Moe, Turturro as Larry, and Tim Blake Nelson as Curly. There is a bit of Popeye, a bit of Ma and Pa Kettle, and yes, the story is based loosely--very loosely--on Homer's Odyssey. The film addresses lofty topics like racial intolerance and political corruption, but in a very humorous way. The film has its own color--kind of a hot and dusty yellow--and music is an integral part of the cinematic OBWAT? experience. While not a musical per se, there is a plethora of blues, gospel, and 'old timey' music to savor. All of these diverse elements are combined here under the able direction of Joel and Ethan Cohen.""... pick up the pieces and retie the knot, mixaphorically speaking... ""Not content to rest merely on their directing laurels, The Brothers Cohen also contribute to the film with their writing. Homer is listed as one of the writers (and good luck getting him or his estate paid their royalties, since none of them are to my knowledge members of the Writers' Guild). Like Homer's Odyssey, a man takes a journey that takes him far from home, but he longs to return to his wife and family before she succumbs to other suitors' advances. Along the way he encounters challenges, such as a Cyclops and some very seductive sirens. But it is what the Brothers Cohen do with the narrative structure provided by the Odyssey that stamps OBWAT? as a Cohen Brothers' product. Especially the dialogue, in particular the words spoken by George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill. He speaks with the eloquence of a backwoods philosopher, but sometimes his thought process is flawed, mixaphorically speaking. He sees himself as having the ""capacity for abstract thought"" but those thoughts are at times perhaps a bit too abstract to be practical. Though his thoughts aren't always logical, as he tells Pete, ""it's a fool that looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart.""""... I guess I'm the only one that remains unaffiliated ...""Clooney is perhaps best known as a dramatic actor, but he has an undeniable flair for comedy. His McGill is quite a creation--an arrogant buffoon who thinks he knows it all while he clearly does not, and yet he is quite endearing. He is kind of a snob, refusing to use FOP because he is a Dapper Dan man, and yet somehow the audience can't resist his obvious charm. John Turturro is a bit harsher as Pete Hogwallop, but he also wins over the audience. Another brilliant characterization for this talented actor. Tim Blake Nelson is a revelation as the naive, good hearted chain gang escapee Delmar O'Donnell. One is reminded of Buster Keaton when TBN is onscreen. The dead pan expression that says it all.""Do you have the Soggy Bottom Boys performing ""Man of Constant Sorrow""?I had the good fortune of seeing Alison Krause and Union Station perform in Bakersfield when they were riding high on the crest of the OBWAT? wave. The guitarist for this group, Dan Tyminski, is the guy who actually sang ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" while Clooney lip synched it. T-Bone Burnett did a fantastic job producing the music for this odyssey. From the seductive song of the sirens, to the blues of Tommy Johnson, and the hit song of those fabled Soggy Bottom boys, or the gospel numbers like ""I'll Fly Away"" it was all top notch. The soundtrack all but swept the Grammies, very unusual for a sound track LP, but understandable, given the caliber of the music.""... if not smithies per se, were you otherwise trained in the metallurgic arts before straitened circumstances forced you into a life of aimless wanderin'?""One final thing I'd like to mention about OBWAT? is the cinematography. The film was shot in the traditional manner, on film, but then the images were manipulated digitally, to give the film a dry and dusty look, like an old time sepia toned photograph, and watching it, you almost feel like you are Grapes of Wrath migrants fleeing the dust bowl in the depression, or chain gang escapees with hell hounds on your tail. The DVD contains bonus material, and one of the segments details the way that color was used to enhance the look, by digitally altering it. They pioneered some cutting edge film processes, and in spite of how modern that may be, it all went toward creating a look that made you feel like you'd traveled back in a time machine to the dry yellow dust bowl of the depression era.""Well, that right there may be the reason you've had difficulty findin' gainful employment. You see, in the mart of competitive commerce... ""In conclusion, OBWAT? was a triumph that featured excellent directing and writing from Joel & Ethan Cohen, great acting from Clooney, Turturro, Nelson, and the rest of the ensemble, fabulous music put together by T-Bone Burnett, and great cinematography.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1TOLRY1BTXBEH	"C. C. Watt ""crazy movie lover"""	This film weaves together a story line that stands on its own as a brilliant work of absurd humor with a richly textured subtext of references to the Odyssey, Sturges' Sullivan's Travels, Moby Dick....  The film works even if you don't get all (or any) of the references, and the performances are delightful.  I never knew I was in desperate need of seeing John Turturro yodel until I did!  The only flaw is that they don't let Charles Durning dance enough.  See this movie --- it's smart, funny, and beautifully filmed, and the music is a fascinating slice of the old South.	5.0	Sheer Genius!!!	2001-06-10	0	0	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3O6Q8OZ2IZV90	C D. McLeod	"If you're thinking that a depression-era adaptation of Homer is going to be like a humidity-soaked 10th grade English lesson, fugheddaboudit.  ""Brother"" just comes alive in your mind as you watch it!  The brilliant writing and direction, the genius camera work, the dead-on charicatures, all of it comes together and sucks you in to the Coen's off-kilter world.  Clooney is a natural for the silver-tongued Ulysses, and Pete and Delmar are perfectly cast - every subtle shift in their simple thought process is clearly written on their face.  Pappy O'Daniel, the Bible salesman, the weasly suitor, each one feeds off of the others to generate a bizarre reality full of omens and prophets and insane cow-killing bank robbers with insecurity complexes.Try it, you'll like it."	5.0	R-U-N-N-O-F-T and buy this thing!	2003-01-03	5	4	1

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1MW4PZT8ZF3NF	Charles	I watch very few of current day movies but my daughter brought the DVD on a visit. Seeing the movie brought back rememberances from the past. In 1940 at the age of 5, I saw Governor W. Lee (Pappy) O'Daniel at a street rally in Farmersville, TX. It is one of my earliest memories and obviously was impressive. It was just as depicted in the movie although I'm not sure the Texas Pappy O'Daniel was such a fool as Charles Durning's character. He, according to my older relatives, was a paragon in radio broadcasting during the '30's and probably had the force in Texas that Walter Cronkite did later nationally on TV. He was elected to head the state of Texas without any political experience. You Are My Sunshine also brought back memories of Jimmie Davis of Louisiana; living in East Texas,we heard his campaign broadcasts from the Shreveport radio station. The Down to the River to Pray segment brought back memories of my own baptism in a similar situation and the a capella singing of the choir was nothing short of beautiful.I thought the acting was a bit over the top but provided the proper setting and emphasis to a very enjoyable movie. I have replayed the movie several times and enjoyed it even more each time. It is a movie well worth keeping and watching again from time to time.	5.0	nostalgic	2001-09-07	3	2	1

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2FS38D943KX12	chefdevergue	The three star rating for this movie is a relative rating.  By most standards, this is a pretty decent movie; by Coen movie standards, comparing it to &quot;Blood Simple&quot; and &quot;Fargo,&quot; it doesn't quite come up to snuff.Very very very loosely based on Homer's &quot;Odyssey&quot; (the Coens admit that they have never read Homer), this movie feels more like a series of vignettes, only marginally connected to each other, loosely strung together.  Some of the scenes, such as the revival down at the river, really don't seem to make much sense and do little to advance the storyline.  Compared to some of the excellently constructed scripts of the other Coen movies, this plotline meanders considerably.  As the movie approaches its conclusion, the plot becomes increasingly contrived in an effort to tie all the loose ends together.That being said, this is nonetheless an extremely enjoyable movie with some great lines (I don't want Fop, goddammit, I'm a Dapper Dan Man!) and engaging characters.  Also, the soundtrack is simply top-notch.  At times, I suspected that the Coens fell in love with bluegrass and crafted this movie just as an excuse to put together a good movie soundtrack.This was a fun movie to watch --- I guess I have just been spoiled by the very high quality of the other Coen films.	3.0	Not the Coens' best, but entertaining nonetheless	2003-06-10	0	0	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1BHOGWPTP8OSN	"Christopherjdixon ""Chris Dixon"""	"It's gotta be some sort of karma that I get to write the 1000th review for this film, because it's simply my favorite movie of all time. And as for the music - don't even get me started.I'll admit right now that I'm biased because 1: I grew up in the south. 2. I grew up listening to true tales summoned from the photographic memory of my southern granddad - a man who sipped homemade scuppernong wine, could hunt, farm and fix anything, ran a cotton gin, a pharmacy, and worked as a rural letter carrier and later a postmaster in Treutlen, County, Georgia. He was a truly great southern storyteller who grew up during the depression and his stories of southern situations - sometimes hilarious, sometimes horrific - are exactly the sorts of tales that permeate the bleak, beautiful and sepia-tinted southern gothic world of Oh Brother Where Art Thou.If you know or understand something of the south between the Confederacy and modern times, then you'll have an easier time appreciating the sometimes subtle and often obvious genius that permeates this entire film. If you know nothing of the south, you'll hopefully, simply appreciate a rollicking good retelling of Homer's ""The Odyssey.""Nuff said."	5.0	One of the greatest movies ever.	2013-10-16	0	0	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3C92MFCGLHDBQ	Clay	FILM:  O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a great comedy set in the dust bowl-era Mississippi starring George Clooney. The film really captures a unique and timeless feeling and combines that with a great plot and heaps of humor. This movie is a somewhat-unknown wonder that is steadily rising in popularity- rightfully! I liked this quality movie with great acting and direction so much that I bought it on DVD after renting it. I would give this four and a half stars if possible.SPECIAL FEATURES:  The special features on this DVD are disappointing, the only one that stands out being &quot;Painting with Pixels&quot;, a suprisingly interesting look at how Mississippi was changed from looking deep green in the summer to dry, barren dust bowl-era autumn. Everything else is very average, and the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; segment borders on boring.	4.0	Very, very good- and extremely original!	2002-07-20	2	2	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A24P4XOBMMD9IO	Clyde McCoy	O Brother Where Art Thou is by far one of the funniest movies I seen in years.  The humor is subtle in parts.  The humor is not your typical hollywood guy running down the street with butt showing..instead this is the thinking person humorous movie.  I have met people who simply didn't get this movie because they fail to see the humor of the dialoge.Hollywood has programmed this generation that if the joke doesn't revolve around sex or nudity it can't be funny.  One of the best parts of this movie is the ability to see the level of humor in polar opposite such as Everett and Delmar.  The two are complete mental opposies.  Everett is the &quot;brains&quot; and Delmar is the &quot;lack there of&quot;.  I think the balance of this movie is found in these two characters.However, the two  characters are joined by a third person who fills in the gaps of Everett and Delmar.  His name was Pete.  Now Pete seems a cut above Delmar mentally but, he falls short of Everett.  So what we find is a nice mix of Intellivence,Ignorance, and dumb innocense.  The 3 amigos face challenge after challenge to reach &quot;the treasure&quot;.  Along the way, they find abilities they didn't know they had, make friends with bible salesman, and pick up hitch-hickers.  All the while the trio find themselves in the middle of some of the best comedic situations on earth.  In short, If you like a movie that is funnier the 2nd time you watch it.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1GUT4C5FJQ2GY	"""comedy_lover"""	Best movie ever, in my opinion.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could.  I'm no fan of George Clooney, but in this movie he was awesome!  And don't be fooled by the title- I thought it was a Shakespearean movie, but it's actually set in the Deep South in the 1920s or so.The Coen brothers' screenplay is genius, flawlessly combining elements of Homer's Odyssey and the history of the Deep South (I especially liked &quot;servant of the little man&quot; and &quot;who made the color guard colored?&quot;).  The three main characters- Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro- are all very good and extremely different.  The movie is full of hilarity from beginning to end, straddling the line between fantasy and reality without ever becoming ludicrous.  Half the fun consists of how gross all the characters look/act (but in a funny way), as well as the strange pronunciations (you might want to turn on subtitles in order to understand some of the dialogue).  The other half lies in the absolutely brilliant screenplay, filled with unexpected twists and turns at every juncture.Today's comedies are so often full of either cheap, lowbrow gags or overly dark humor.  This movie has neither, and furthermore contains a number of wonderful historical and mythical references- glued together by stunning performances from all actors involved.  I've watched this movie again and again, and it never loses its charm.  Some of the later scenes involving Holly Hunter (as the nasty ex-wife) are not particularly funny and, in my opinion, inferior to the rest of the piece.  Nevertheless, this picture is the best comedy I have ever seen.  See it now if you haven't already!	5.0	Best Movie EVER!	2003-12-06	4	2	2
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A10F4DPWVANEI0	Corey Livermore	"This movie is by far one of the all-time best movies ever made.  Joel Coen does an excellent job of translating Homer's ""Odyssey"" into a modern-day (well, Depression-era US) story, while keeping the audience entertained and riveted to the screen.Our story starts with Ulysses Everett McGill, Pete, and Delmar off to find ""the treasure"", which is supposed to be $1 million dollars.  ""1.2, to be exact.""  But our boys soon find themselves mixed up in all kinds of adventures, from being ""in a tight spot"", to ""singing in a can"", to finding out Everett has been hit by a train and his wife's new beau (""He's a suitor!"") to being ""bona fide"".This movie really has it all - a great musical soundtrack, outstanding acting, good storyline, and, most importantly, a happy ending.  What else could a guy want out of a movie?  Explosions?

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A16CBAFQOTEHO6	cp	I can't really comment on the technical format or quality of the DVD, since I know nothing about this. What I can say is that the Coen brothers are really strengthening their reputation as one of the few truly intelligent acts in Hollywood. Loosely adapted from Homer's &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, this film is truly &quot;American&quot;; icons such as apple pie, Americana music and Dapper Dan hair care(does or did it actually exist?) permeate this movie and it looks great. One does not really need to see it in terms of the original Odyssey: it's perfectly enjoyable even if you can't really remember Homer's version. George Clooney and the rest of the cast are stunning. The photography is amazing. My personal favourite moment: a midnight Ku Klux Klan gathering that is so well choreographed and so grotesque, you have to say to yourself that The Coen brothers are now a major force in shaping American cinema. Watch out for their new movie &quot;The Man Who Wasn't There&quot;	4.0	Who doesn't love the Coen brothers?	2001-05-21	0	0	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2ZY49IDE6TY5I	"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby"""	From my point of view, if you don't like Coen Bros. movies, you must be a very humorless person. I love the quirky characters with their odd nuances, the plotlines which fly off the wall, the fact that I absolutely don't get bored because the story is constantly moving at warp speed.This is perfect Coen Bros. Clooney, Turturro, Hunter, and the rest of the ensemble cast don't disappoint. The music is great and really becomes an integral part of the story. Wonderful viewing when you need a good laugh.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A51IK68MWKV5R	"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies"""	"This Coen brothers adaptation of Homer's Odyssey is the first film of theirs where I have felt disappointed. It could be because I expect such high quality from them, but I noticed a few points in the film where more could have been done with a scene.Personally, I believe they were hampered by having to follow a strict story path. Being an adaptation does not allow for much in the way of imagination. One much do what one can with what one is given. The weakest points were those with Everett (George Clooney in a terrific comic departure from his normal ""cool guy"" roles) and Penny (Holly Hunter), the Ulysses/Penelope story. I also felt not enough was done with the Sirens.The performances are top-flight all around, with only Pete (John Turturro) not given much to do. Tim Blake Nelson (director of ""O"") is a discovery as Delmar and shows he has talent in front of the camera as well. But once the film was over, I didn't feel that it had left me with much to chew on, as the saying goes, except that I was humming ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" for the rest of the evening."	3.0	Disappointed	2002-10-03	7	2	5
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A39CX0EE4BZCZC	Craig Connell	"This may be the only film that is blatantly anti-Christian that I still give a high rating, simply because it was so entertaining. Hopefully, some of the religious digs were tongue-in-cheek and not meant in a mean-spirited way, but I'm not sure, especially considering the Coen Brothers made it.The music in here is super, led by the catchy ""Man Of Constant Sorrow,"" performed by Dan Tyminski. I also loved ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" humorously sang and presented by the three main characters: George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. Those three guys were hilarious, particularly Nelson with his rubber-faced looks. Audibly, the entire soundtrack is outstanding, under the direction of T-Bone Burnett. I wound up buying the CD as millions of other people did. Fantastic music.The way this was filmed makes it visually fascinating, with scenery enhanced by computer graphics and all-time great Roger Deakins in charge of the photography. All the people in this movie are wacky, as are the people who made it. The parade of wild characters, wild scenes one after the other and the three likable leads (yeah, even excessive abuser of the Lord's name in vain Clooney) make this an extremely fast-moving 103-minute movie."	4.0	Mixed Emotions Message-Wise, But Extremely Entertaining	2009-03-30	2	2	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	First - the movie.  Three convicts escape from a chain-gang and set of on a quest, supposedly based on the Odyssey, although the Coens later claimed to have never read it.  However, we have Sirens who abduct one of the escapees, a Cyclops (played by John Goodman), and a Penny (Penelope).  In addition, we have less obvious characters, such as a manic-depressive bank robber, a KKK-belonging gubernatorial candidate, and his populist encumbant opponent.  All of these characters provide some big laughs, little chuckles, and a healthy dose of bluegrass music.  It's all presented in a washed-out colour that lends a beautiful visual style to the piece.The film has most of the hallmarks of the Coen brothers.  This depression-era Mississippi didn't ever exist, but we wish it did.  It's filled with caricature characters with amusing quirks and one-track minds.  Missing is the occasional brutal violence that has a tendency to crop up in some of their work.  As such, this is one of the most good-hearted of the Coens' films, and I enjoyed it more than, say, Fargo.  However, it's probably more forgettable than their other work.  In addition, the film is almost a musical with its profusion of tunes.  However, I'm not much of a bluegrass fan, so found that the musical parts, though well-done, could have been shortened.  It moved just a little too slowly and lingered just a little too long in these passages.Secondly - the DVD version.  Obviously, the sound and picture is very good, but the DVD left me disappointed.  Who could be more interesting in a commentary track than the Coen brothers?  Alas, there is no commentary - the best we get is a making of featurette that is only 20 minutes or so.  It's okay in itself, but too short to compensate.  Of equal length is a piece on the digitisation of the film to achieve the desired look (which could have been told in 1/2 the time) and a storyboard-to-film comparison, which was not particularly interesting.The film might rate a 4, but this DVD edition is disappointing, and drops the rating to a 3.  I would certainly recommend it as a renter, but not worth the cost of buying the DVD.	3.0	Possibly the Coens' best, but a poor DVD	2001-12-02	4	0	4
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	"I stupidly let this go by when it was in theatrical release. Then one night I rented it on a whim and was blown away.Some have made a great deal of this as a retelling of Homer's Odyssey.  My own thinking is that even though there is a ""cyclops"" and a scene with ""sirens"" and a few other superficial similarities with Homer this is really its own tale. I guess you could occupy yourself in identifying the various names as a kind of puzzle, but this really isn't the Odyssey in any deep way.  However, it is a lot of fun with great music and the humor is a delight from beginning to end. It is a movie I enjoy watching over and over again to catch little new things here and there.It isn't a deep movie, it isn't particularly profound, and it isn't a laugh until you drop kind of comedy. But it is a bright comedy with intelligence and wit to spare. I have enjoyed watching it several times.  Don't miss it."	5.0	Don't miss this gem! Both Fun and Funny.	2001-08-19	0	0	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2FES1XMFNP3UP	Cristian	"I was in Miami with my wife at the moment in which this movie premiered on theaters at the U.S.A.; and knowing that it has been directed by the talented Coen brothers, rushed to the cinema to see it at once, thinking that we were going to find something close to ""FARGO"" or ""THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE"".Unluckely, 20 or 25 minutes after the beginning of the film, we found ourselves looking at each other, and thinking something like ""When will the usually original and funny Coen movie's plot begin?"". Well, It never did...We waited for 10 or 15 fifteen minutes more, and as nothing interesting was yet happening on the big screen, took the decision of leaving the theater, and drove back to our hotel... Perhaps, we still had the chance to catch another movie -anyone would be better than this- on our room's pay per view TV.By the way, anyone who intends to understand why the Coen brothers gained their fame of being part of today's great American filmakers (like Clint Eastwood, Martin Scosese, Francis Ford Coppola or Aaron Aranofsky), should see (i) the excellent ""FARGO"" (with Frances Mc Dormand and Willian H, Macy), (ii) the very good ""THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE"" (with Frances Mc Dormand, Billy Bob Thornton and James Gandolfini) and ""BURN AFTER READING"" (with Frances Mc Dormand, George Clooney, Brad Pitt and John Malkovich), or (iii) the good ""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN"" (with Javier Bardem -winner of the best supporting actor's Oscar for this performance-, and Tommy Lee Jones), who won the 2007 best film Oscar, although it should have gone, instead, to Paul Thomas Anderson's much better ""THERE WILL BE BLOOD""; absolutely avoiding ""BARTON FINK"" or this one (""O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?"")."	1.0	"Worst than ""Barton Fink"""	2009-06-14	28	2	26

I really enjoyed looking for parallels to the Odyssey while watching the movie, and it made me want to reread the Odyssey and then watch O Brother again to pick up on all of the allusions.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A7XFG3KKTK8H5	Dave	This movie is well made and perfectly depicts the south, especially Mississippi in which I unfortunately live (for 7 years now). Also, it accurately depicts the mentality of women in the south, always looking for a &#34;bonafide&#34; suitor (rich guy) to buy them a meal ticket out of poverty, while at the same time starting drama at every turn, because they have no life. I like to think that politics and business in Mississippi is pretty much the same now, as depicted in this movie, except for maybe some modern technology and newer automobiles. Southern baptist culture is the same, with superstitious ideologies and secret hatred towards blacks. All in all, this is a timeless movie, loosely based on  &#34;The Odessy&#34; by Homer, and well worth the price of rental.	5.0	Great movie and totally accurate	2014-04-18	0	0	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	AEMZRE6QYVQBS	David A.

You can love this movie without knowing Homer, of course, though it's based on that bard's Oddysey.That's the common touch of both Homer and his erstwhile partners-in-crime, producers Ethan and Joel Coen.Filming this flick must have been more fun than a body should have. From the blind oracle on the railroad pump-car warning about the 'Ob-stackles of life' to the 'Sigh-REENS' that appear to have 'loved (Pete) up ... and then turned him into a horny toad' to the delicious stares and triumphant penultimate scene where the Soggy Bottom Boys regale a political rally with their irresistable hit 'Man of Constant Sorrows', O BROTHER never falters.It's a film for watching over and over again, preferably introducing somebody who hasn't seen it each time you do.Ne'er doubt!

The color scheme that they used in the filming, whatever they did, perfect also. The transitions, the composition of every scene. Absolutely amazing work. The movie just flows, from one scene to the next. No abrupt changes that make you question the transitions.The soundtrack is perfect. The entire movie goes along with a soundtrack, almost making it a musical, without you even knowing. You think you're watching a movie, but I also have kept this movie on in the background, while doing work, and I can actually listen to the movie. It's as entertaining to listen to as it is to watch.I'm not much of a judge of acting, but I would assume that the acting is great, also. Most people here seem to say it is.

This will always set an example and become a classic for movie makers to learn from for decades, perhaps centuries to come!George Clooney sets himself apart from every other role he's ever played, and should have walked home with an Oscar for his hilarious portrayal of the perfect backwards southern gentleman and leader of the fictional Soggy Bottom Boys...""Believe me Delmar, woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days of man!"" John Turturro, ""Do not seek the treasure!!"", also rounds out the ""three stooges"" group with a magnificent performance with Tim Blake Nelson...""We thought you was a toad!"" John Goodman is perfect as the 'cyclops' personae of Homer's vision.And then there is the soundtrack! As the 'angels' walk through the woods singing ""Down In The River To Pray"", you can actually feel the same awe and astonishment the Boys are feeling. You almost buy the fact that Clooney's lip-synch to ""Man Of Constant Sorrow"" is really his own voice, which only adds to the charm of the performance.Like I said, 5 stars and 2 thumbs up aren't enough for this one! Those of you who didn't understand this film are just as hilarious as the movie itself. Clooney's 'Ulysses Everett' said it best...""I swear you boys are dumber than a bag of hammers!""Homer would be proud!"	5.0	I can only give it 5 stars? What an injustice!!!	2008-04-07	1	0	1

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1T9YSDAYS097M	D. Bannister	Tagged as the team of the consummate quirky movie, the Coen brothers' newest release, Oh Brother Where Art Though, is one supposes their clever reconstruction of Homer's Odyssey with a heavy sprinkling of blue grass music.In it three connected members of a chain gang go on a journey for treasure that George Clooney's character, Ulysses Everett McGill, says he has hidden. His partners played by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson complete the ensemble of misfits.There are some readily recognizable episodes from the Odyssey imaginatively set in the 1930's South. The most pleasing is John Goodman as the Cyclops. The music is placed throughout the movie and seems a natural counterpart to the performance. The movie is well acted and constructed.However, as with all the Coen films, their humour is inevitably at the expense of a disadvantaged demographic. Their films habitually exploit the setting and people in rural, geographically depressed areas. What is funny about this? It is pity that they feel they have the right to mine this material in the first place, and it is a pity that their imaginations cannot extend beyond it.There is a limited appeal to the Coen films which I'm sure they rationalize as being misunderstood by the wider audience. In plain fact the audience recognizes the films as meanly comical and wildly stereotypic and chooses not to go. Oh Brother, Where Art Thou is only another sugar-coated extension of this meanness.	2.0	Is it really that funny?	2001-06-19	8	3	5
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2H6JYJZBHQJT7	DB	This is one of my favorite movies of all time. However, the Blu-Ray version has serious problems. It will play in an older Sony Blu-Ray player, but it won't play in my newer Sony Blu-Ray player. After over an hour on the phone with tech support at Sony, I learned that many new Blu-Ray discs are having problems and they cannot keep up with the firmware upgrades. Since Sony is one of the originators of the Blu-Ray format, I am obviously disappointed. They said that only if enough customers call in with the same problem will they commit the time to make their player work with a disc based on their technology. Before purchasing a newer release on Blu-Ray I would recommend verifying that the manufacturer of your Blu-Ray player has already verified compatibility.	2.0	Great movie; Bad Blu-Ray	2012-03-29	3	2	1

Listen to it carefully, even if you are not a bluegrass fan.  Although not a traditonal musical I can think of no other movie in modern times that is so closely tied to the music.  I will not try and explain all symbolism and references to Homer or other works.  I just have to say that this movie is remarkable and I do think you have to watch it at least twice before you make a judgement about it ( I have watched it about 5 times in the last two weeks).

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2F94EINMH2JLT	Debbie	Speaking as a true, Southern American, the wit and humor in this movie was outstanding. I constantly caught myselfing looking at George Clooney trying to see past the character-he made it so convincing that one forgot who he was-he reminds one of a seedy, on-the-outs version of Clark Gable. Who knew he had it in him?? It's one of those movies-which is rare-that you want to watch over and over. The music, along with the fine acting, made for an outstanding viewing and listening experience.In my opinion, the movie captured the essence of southern America-the ability to laugh at our own foibles and eccentricities. In a nutshell-&quot;good ole southern humor and music&quot;. I hated seeing it end.....

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A23GFTVIETX7DS	Debbie Lee Wesselmann	This is one of those movies that will have you shaking your head throughout, not because you don't understand it, but because you can't believe how the Coen brothers strung the scenes together.  Three convicts escape from a chain gang to search for a treasure their leader (George Clooney) vows to split with them.  This is the nearly invisible thread that holds the movie together; everything else feels like a series of unrelated bits - until the end, when most falls into place.At first, Clooney's acting seemed terribly self-conscious and flat - I could understand only half of what he said because of mumbling delivery.  Soon, however, both he and I grew into his role as the fast-talking, pomade-obsessed, singing leader of the gang.  Holly Hunter, as his wife, steals every scene she's in; Hunter plays this small part with just the right mix of spunk and self-righteousness.The Ku Klux Klan scene has to be seen to be believed.  I didn't know whether to laugh or be horrified - the true mark of the Coen brothers.Although the soundtrack seems to be better known than the movie itself, the film deserves attention in its own right.  If you're looking for something offbeat, this is your film.	4.0	Quirky fun!	2001-08-08	10	7	3
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2UI2GW70Q8EXA	"""debbie-n-va"""	First, and foremost, I am a bluegrass fanatic, so that is what drew me to this movie.  I also had the soundtrack to this movie since the day it became available.  I find this movie very entertaining and while not totally historically accurate, who cares?  It was one of those movies that left you feeling good.  As for the music, I'm a Ralph Stanley fan (who wrote or recorded a lot of the songs in the movie) and I love Dan Tyminski (who is the voice you here when Clooney supposedly sings.  Dan was once a member of Allison Krauss and Union Station) and I have followed him for years.  How refreshing to hear Dan's voice coming from George Clooney's mouth!!  At first I didn't think that George would be able to pull off this role, but he did a fantastic job as Ulysses Everett McGill.  The other two &quot;cons&quot; were perfectly casted and John Goodman was his ever brillant self.  This movie is worth watching and owning!!	5.0	A very very entertaining movie.	2001-07-16	4	4	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	ARC5GYVVR3J2V	Decimated1184	Just like the Cohen Brother's last effort, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou?&quot; suffers from the fact that it's wonderfully done with a vast amount of flair, but suffer's from an otherwise &quot;uneven&quot; story-structure, and rather pointless non-potent social commentary. Very well crafted and very well directed, it's an enjoyable experience, if not  a hilarious one at that. The perfomances are great, with John Goodman and Geroge Clooney coming out on top, not for all tastes, &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou?&quot; is pure Cohen Brothers, and some of it's subject matter might upset a marginal pair audience. The films photgraphy is beautifully done as well, with it's symbolic browns and greens crused into one frame. It may not be in the Same League as their &quot;Blood Simple(1986) or &quot;Fargo(1994)&quot;...but serves as a good companion piece to their second string &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, both films that center around a pair of misfits who find themselves in the most non-ambiguous of situations.Rating: 31/2 out of 5Grade: B 86%	3.0	A typical beautifully done but otherwise &quot;uneven&quot; Cohen film	2001-08-14	3	0	3
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1AEDW75371P5M	Dellin Canfield (dellincanfield@hotmail.com)	Sorry, even though I love the Coen brothers I just can't give this movie more than 3.5 stars.  I'm not exactly sure what it is that didn't grab me. I was absolutely stunned, as always, by the tremendous visuals that the Coens threw up there on the big screen, but the lack of a clear, coherent purpose in this movie set me off a little bit.  First of all let's get one thing straight, this movie is not based on the odyssey.  Apart from the siren scene, the fact that Clooney's character is named Ulyssees and that his wife is named Penelope there are no similarities.  The movie does have it's highlights (a muffed KKK ralley for example where the Coens make the sheet toting idiots out to be the total morons that they are) but I think the predominance of bluegrass music really threw me off.  As with every Coen movie, every component--dialogue, cinematography, music--all are utilized to their fullest potential and injected with the maximum amount of meaning.  The bluegrass music is therefore a key component and you can't just tune it out if you hate bluegrass music like I do.  So essentially if you love bluegrass music you might think this is the best movie ever made, if not, you'll still find something to enjoy, but it will be somewhat tainted.	3.0	Three and a Half Stars	2001-06-15	31	6	25

It's a comedy with music, long but pretty funny.The southern characters are depicted comically well past hillbilly.The film takes place in the depression era Bible belt south.  Southern Hymns ""Old Timmy"" style music is sung throughout the film which is quite beautiful. (Historically the music is from real depression era artists.  George Clooney's song and singer received a Grammy award for this film).  The meant to be absurd deep, deep, deep, south accents, names (""Hogwallop"") and dialog (""Hemp ya sef "") are hilarious.Even the KKK's ridiculous song singing and choreographed dancing, takes the seriousness from there goal.George Clooney plays an intelligent guy with the ""gift of gab"" who's also obsessed with his hair needing pomade and a hair net regularly, ""My hair"".John Turturro plays a pretty serious southern companion of Clooney's, ""You stole from ma kin!""

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	ABN5K7K1TM1QA	Dennis Littrell	"This depression era period piece is simply a delight.  The music is wonderful; the fanciful, on the road story of lovable escaped convict country bumpkins, who pratfall their way through numerous scrapes invites hilarity; and the beautifully dove-tailed script by the Coen brothers is marvelous.That script was nominated for the Oscar for Best Screenplay based on material from another medium for 2001, but didn't win.  (Stephen Gaghan won for Traffic.)  But never mind.  The writing is just so clever and that is part of what makes this movie so much fun to watch.That won't surprise viewers who are familiar with the work of Ethan and Joel Coen.  Those guys are strikingly original talents who can write comedy and noir with the best of them as in, e.g., Raising Arizona (1987), Blood Simple (1984)--their first, and in some ways, their best--and of course Fargo (1996).  Their work is characterized by irony, satirical intent, and sly plotting in which later events are foreshadowed by previous events.  O, Brother, Where Art Thou? is especially replete with clever foreshadowing.  Characters appear, as they are wont to do in road movies or epic wanderings, and then they are left behind as our heroes move on.  Here however, the first appearance of a character is probably not the last appearance.  When John Goodman first appears as a morally and ethnically-challenged Bible salesman who welds a mean stick, we may think he is gone, but (I'll keep this vague) when he reappears we are not surprised; in fact his reappearance is just right.One of the highlights is George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill whose sweet-smelling Dapper Dan hair pomade plays a bit of a role in the plot.  He is perfect as a slick-talking, hairnet-wearing country wordsmith who could charm the birds out of the trees.  With the slicked-back hair and the thin moustache, he reminded me a bit of Clark Gable, which is only right since Gable was a thirties film star whose style was much imitated.Clooney is supported by John Turturro, who has played in at least two other Coen and Coen movies that I have seen.  He is one of those non-glamourous actors who is at the top of the profession.  It may seem a bit of a casting stretch to play him as a Mississippi bumpkin, but he pulls it off.  This is the same guy who was just perfect as a New York Jewish writer gone to Hollywood in Coen and Coen's Barton Fink (1991).This is the first time I've seen Tim Blake Nelson, but he was also very good as the third country musketeer.  As usual the alluring Holly Hunter gives a solid performance as Everett's estranged wife about to marry another man, the mother of his six daughters.  But make no mistake about it, Clooney clearly steals the show, and I am surprised he wasn't nominated for Best Actor.  He was really that good.  (He did win a Golden Globe award.)And the music: country, bluegrass, hillbilly, gospel, traditional--and I know not what else--is really at the heart of the flick.  When the ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" come on with their ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" it really brings the house down.  The Coens know this, and so later in the movie when the boys appear on stage, looking a little like ZZTop on a budget, they reprise it to the delight of the Mississippi folk at a political rally and really get the joint to jumping--and of course it all figures in the plot.  And how appropriate is that lyric for a depression era song: ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow""!See this for both the Coen Brothers who know how to have fun with a movie, and for George Clooney, who puts on a mighty good show."	5.0	You're gonna love this movie	2005-03-22	4	2	2

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3QEVXTJ82LD4M	D. Horton	For a lot of people like me who live in the Deep South, this movie has become a cherished cultural gem since it was released ten years ago.  Not only is it one of the funniest movies the Coen Brothers have ever released, it seems like every man, woman, and child south of the Mason Dixon is issued a copy of the soundtrack at birth.This movie has begged for a BluRay release since the inception of the format.  It was one of the first movies to be given digital color correction in post production, which gives the movie a sepia toned look reminiscent of photos you'd find taken in the era.  There are a ton of wide shots that feature a late summer landscape of Mississippi, which are going to look awesome in high definition.It usually doesn't make a whole lot of sense to spend a few bucks extra for a BluRay of a comedy movie, but this is one exception where it's absolutely worth it.  The only downside about this BluRay is that it's taken so long for it to be released in the first place.	5.0	Took WAY too long to get this on BluRay!	2011-09-12	2	2	0

This movie is a quirky adventure which features three escaped convicts (George Clooney and his two bumbling counterparts) who experience an epic adventure together.Overall, the plot is quite simple (as is many aspects of the movie), but it is full of interesting scenes and witty dialogue.  I was really surprised by how well that George Clooney pulled off his role, and how funny some of the rather bizarre scenes turn out.  The soundtrack was also quite good, which was a nice bonus, especially considering the fact that I am not a big bluegrass fan.I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys offbeat comedy, especially with a Southern flair to it.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A11PTCZ2FM2547	"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here"""	"Only the Coen brothers would be warped enough to come up with a tribute to the The Odyssey based in Depression Era Mississippi in their entertaining O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?  Only the Ulysses this time is an escaped con, who along with two cohorts, embark on a surreal journey searching for an alleged ""loot"" that will make them rich beyond their wildest dreams.  But they're already rich and famous--they just don't know it.  Joining a fourth man who has just sold his soul to the devil to play the guitar, they record ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" in a cracker box studio, calling themselves the Soggy Bottom Boys; the tune becomes a statewide sensation.  Yet Ulysses and his group are constantly on the run, primarily from prison guards intent on inflicting their own vigilante justice; en route the runaways encounter just about everything, from seductive sirens to a one-eyed con. . .even a choreographed Klan rally.  Yet as this delightful film comes to its climax, we learn the real reason Ulysses wants to escape from prison.George Clooney is sensational as Ulysses Everett McGill, a smooth-talking persuader with a weakness for Dapper Dan pomade (no doubt a tongue-in-cheek spoof to Clooney himself). But even better are John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as Pete and Delmar, the fellow cons who escape with Ulysses.  Both sport enough clueless facial expressions and thick hick twang to make Hee Haw look like Masterpiece Theater.  John Goodman, always remarkably good, has a brief role as a one-eyed Bible salesman--a salesman with other intentions up his sleeve.  And the rest of the cast more than holds its own.  But the real stars of O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? are the imaginative Coens, who through their images and music and settings serve us up a slice of Down South Americana. It's definitely humor with a dark edge; the flawlessly choreographed Klan rally (conjuring images of Nuremberg) is fabulously funny, yet its ugly point is unmistakably made.  Sometimes a bit too whimsical, O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? is still a grand satirical tribute to one of the oldest tales of time.--D. Mikels, Esq."	4.0	From Sirens to Klan Dancerrs	2013-07-12	0	0	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	ARFLESOGLXAFD	"Doc Dave ""Doc Dave"""	This is my favorite movie of all time.  I never much liked George Clooney until I saw this film and realized how wildly funny he can be.  His compulsive haircare and the fit he pitches over FOP vs. Dapper Dan just kill me!  The acting is great by all though, and the characters are truly priceless!  I am tempted to describe all my favorite bits from the movie here, but it would just be way too much writing.  In my opinion, the best humor in this film is subdued, but it is also extremely clever and biting.  I also appreciate the loose connections with actual events and people from the period: Tommy (Robert) Johnson at the crossroads, George (Baby Face) Nelson, TVA projects, etc.  It probably helps if you don't hate old-time music and bluegrass, but being steeped in it myself I really couldn't say.  For me, purchasing this movie was worthwhile, because I never get tired of watching it.  I hope you'll like it too.	5.0	my favorite	2005-11-17	6	6	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM	Dom Miliano	I approached the DVD with reservation. My friend said that it was his wife's favorite movie and they had watched the DVD so many times that now he had begun to like it a lot too. I got a copy and was caught up in the story right away. The cast of characters are almost cartoon-like in their simplicity but the actors play them with energy and creativity. Clooney's star power comes through but he doesn't dominate the film. Instead, he come across exactly as he should - as a man who has survived on his charm and not his wits. The masterful way the music is used as a unifying force worked very well for me (I bought the CD as well). Without the outstanding music score, the movie would not have been as appealing. It is making the rounds on cable these days and when I scan past it, I hang in there for a while because the acting is so good and each scene is photographed beautifully. Maybe not a film for everyone, but it works just fine for me.	5.0	Probably not for everyone, but it's a wonderful movie	2003-01-10	2	1	1

By the time the movie is over, you will and I would recommend that you order the sound track CD at the same time you are buying this.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1TJIJKKN15KR9	drqshadow	Maybe the perfect adventure film, this instant Coen classic is impossible to turn away from. Though it makes no mistake about its influences - an early title card immediately identifies the picture as an adaptation of Homer's Odyssey - the brilliance of O Brother is in its departures from the source material, which come so frequently that the carryovers (the Sirens, the Cyclops, the protagonist's escape from captivity) are celebrated as nods and winks, expected but also unexpected. George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson are perfectly cast as the charismatically brainless scoundrels at the story's epicenter, while guest spots from John Goodman, Holly Hunter and Charles Durning take the whole mess over the top. Amazingly rich, sharp-witted, engrossing stuff that's accompanied by an all-time favorite of a soundtrack.	5.0	This Depression-Era Tall Tale Never Gets Old	2012-01-16	0	0	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A152SSOLOQH272	E. A. Bush	The Coen brothers said that O' Brother, Where Art Thou? was loosely based on Homer's Odyssey. They delivered the goods. It's loosely but not that loosely based upon that ancient tale. O' Brother improved upon the Odyssey for one thing: it has a great soundtrack, which isn't surprising as Homer was not noted for his singing. If you like traditional southern music, it is a delight.

The first time around, I thought it was witty and funny, but a mediocre film.I finally got around to watching it a second time all the way through.  Since then, I have become a Coen affecionado, discovering more and more the subtle yet hilarious comedy that the Coen brothers seem to flavor all their movies with.  I HAD to go out and buy this film, and I've watched the movie about a dozen times now, finding it more funny every time.  One of my most-watched DVD's in my collection.I recommend giving it a try - and if you've seen it once and didn't like it, I recommend giving it a second chance.	5.0	GREAT MOVIE!!	2001-11-17	3	2	1

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	APVNDUMOTRJ78	E. Drake	I don't think there is a single thing I can add to the reviews on this film that has not already been said. For the sake that I intended on saying something about each of the Coen Brother's films, I just have to say something however.Yes, I agree. This film is a perfect, I do mean perfect, film experience. Not only do the Coen Brother's (and cinematographer Roger Deakins) bring us into the Dust Bowl era, they unintentionally bring us a piece which works as a complication for the entire history of film making. The characters, the many styles, the weirdness, the seriousness, the stupidness, the intelligence, the colors, the editing and the the story were perfectly orchestrated into this perfect film. The only other thing I can mention and haven't mentioned is the music. I have been listening to Blues music since I was in elementary school and I must say that this complication of Blues/Gospel/Country/Field work music is simply stunning.The Coen Brothers, their actors and production team have done an incredible job on this one.	4.0	Coen Brothers: Film # 8	2008-05-13	1	1	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A15TNUM2PBS6F0	"Ei ""crzybookmoovielover"""	I guess this movie is supposed to be some kind of modern day Homer's Oddessey.  I never read it, but I've heard that it's a bit similar, but not completely like it.  It stars George Clooney who really surprised me in this movie! I am not much of a fan, and I thought he was very good as the prisoner who breaks loose from a chain gang.  He's kind of the one is charge, and the two men he drags along don't want him to be the one who's boss. One is played by John Turtorro, and well, honestly I have no idea who the other actor is, but he is very good and extremely funny in this movie  They are all on the lam together, and as Clooney is trying to get back to his wife and family the thre of them have adventures -- not all good ones.  They even start a singing career as the Soggy Bottom Boys.  All the songs are old folk and blue grass songs, and the actors lip synch.  I really thought it was Clooney singing the first time I saw this!  The singing and dancing really brings great delight to this very sunny little movie. It kind of reminded me of The Wizard of Oz in that way.  There is even one scene where they view KKK members marching around while hiding behind a bush.  They eventually manage to get three of the members and steal their uniforms to save a man from being killed...In the wizard of Oz, the three friends of Dorothy watch the henchmen for the witch march around and eventually steal uniforms from three of the men.  There is even similar chanting in O Brother... I don't want to give anything else away, but JOhn Goodman plays one of the many people they meet along their journey, and Stephen Root, who is a very funny character actor(the boss on Newsradio) plays a blind dj, who made me howl with laughter. Holly Hunter is in it as Clooney's estranged wife Penelope. The best thing I really loved about this movie is the music.  I bought the soundtrack the next day, and it is awesome.  If you are fan of folk and bluegrass, you'll absolutely love this soundtrack.  It's a very funny film that is well acted and beautifully filmed.  The Coen &quot;brothers&quot; have made another excellent film.  I also love the way the film is made to look like it is an old movie, with the coloring that is used.  It really adds to it. I highly recommend this one..IT's defintely worth buying.	4.0	love those soggybottom boys....	2001-06-22	1	1	0

But when the critics started trashing it, I decided that I was going to wait untill it came to DVD.This Friday while at work,I got pretty interested in the film when I saw that the DVD's were selling like hotcakes. So I said what the heck and bought the last one. Boy were the critics wrong! This is a superb movie. It is rich and vibrant with color along with humor and a great story. Since it was based on the Odyssey by Homer, (which we read in Englis class), I found it fun figuring out who all the charachters were. Not only is this film fun, clever, and exciting, but it also has a deeper, less notable undelaying theme mocking todays society. I hope you go out and buy this movie no matter what anybody says. The only problem with this film is some of the charachtor's southern accents are hard to understand (me being from connecticut and all) so I had to turn on the sub-titles one in a while. But otherwise A damn good movie. I learned only one thing out of all of this. Screw the critics, just go with your gut feeling.	5.0	Damn Good Film	2001-06-18	1	1	0

A343FLTE5IPJ7R	eric	There have been so many great movies (starting with &#34;Blood Simple&#34;, which I still remember seeing when it debuted) that picking 1 is based more on personal preference than anything else. This story, based loosely on The Odyssey, has the great acting seen in all Coen movies (I enjoy seeing many of the same actors in their different movies and it's more like a family getting together to create). It's a fast, funny at times, crazed version of the old story of a lost man trying to find his way home.

A313FHXGRZNB68	"FateJacketX ""FJX"""	"I really love this movie and it would be absolutely perfect if not for its occasional lags in interest, especially during the space in which the two convicts lose their friend to the Sirens. But, I'm jumping ahead...let's get to the review.The opening sequence is a great musical experience which begins with a 1930's singing chain gang, voiced by James Carter and the Prisoners (found on your best Blues collections.) That goes straight to ""Big Rock Cany Mountain,"" a bluegrass favorite, as we cut to Pete, Delmar and Everett hauling ass through a field, having escaped the gang and are searching for freedom. Amazing way to open the credits.Once the boys are on their way, we get to meet them. Everett, played by Clooney, is a know-it-all with an obvious education and a vain care for his hair. Pete is an angry country boy who loves conflict - John Turturro is great in this part. Delmar is their sometimes innocent, always simple-minded end to the trio. Everett has talked the other two into escaping with him to find the treasure he stole, buried, and was sent to jail for.This is a sometimes loose adaptation of Homer's ""The Odyssey."" The Cohen Brothers have admitted to never reading the book but they seem to have really studied the cliff notes front to back. If you look closely, you can find every piece of the film's inside to the poem. For instance:The prisoners find a blind railpusher who tells their future just as Odysseus was told his by Tiresius.Everett's first name Ulysees is Roman for the Greek Odysseus.The Sheriff plays the part of the Devil. But, I think, the GOV candidate is supposed to be Poseiden. THAT IS made thinkable by the fact that the CYCLOPS/John Goodman is his minion.The trance-like prayer flock that goes to the river to pray are just like the drug-addicted ""lotus eaters"" that Odysseus has to keep his troop away from.John Goodman's Dan with the eyepatch is one-half of the ""Cyclops."" The other half of the Cyclops (which Odysseus outsmarts) is the blind radio announcer that Everett swindles out of extra money.When Everett goes to find his estranged wife Penny (Odysseus' Penelope), he finds that she has found a suitor. Odysseus finds his wife and family overtaken by many suitors.Everett gets beaten down by the suitor just as Odysseus gets jumped by many suitors.It goes on but I won't list them all. What I want to mention the most here is the sterling sountrack. It's got a little blues, a shade of country, but tons of bluegrass that I had no idea I was a fan of until I saw the movie. Great favorites all around, well integrated into the movie. Parts that I loved the most in the film are...""Damn! We're in a tight spot!"" (you'll know what I mean)The opening.Tommy the guitar player.The major-hot Sirens.Every time the boys sing ""Man of Constant Sorrow.""""Angel Band"" from the end credits.It really is one of the Cohen Brothers' best.

It gave me a giggle but I can't say it really gave me any belly-laughs. George Clooney is George Clooney, a bit arrogant and self opinionated, not to say selfish to drag out of the prison two other crooks who had the misfortune to be chained to him although they only had a few weeks to do before being free with the temptation of sharing a 1.2$million booty which didn't really exist.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3IKBHODOTYYHM	"fra7299 ""fra7299"""	"The ideas behind this movie were wonderful. I mean, who would have thought of making a modern version of Homer's work The Odyssey to fit a group of criminals in the early 1900s. Our hero must go through many of the parallels of a Mythological epic, namely a one eyed prophet, beautiful Sirens, and continual problems with the ""gods."" The three convicts get separated and try to reunite; the hero's journey (George Clooney) is characterized by bad luck, mistiming, and encounters with both good and evil individuals. What makes this a unique film is the humor that adds in to the serious plot, such as the hero's believe that one of his friends has, in fact, been turned into a frog.I thought it was a little over-the-top in the soundtrack department, however. We really didn't need song after song after song. One or two would have sufficed. It took away from the flow of the story, and made the movie tend to drag a little.A 3 and a half stars is about the rating I would give this film. I think it is better than average movie, but still has its flaws. Still, it is a movie I would recommend overall because it concieves a very original idea and goes with it. It is a movie that is willing to take a chance on making a serious and revered work into a modern adventure."	3.0	A Southern Odyssey	2002-07-17	3	1	2
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	ACVNA57PI4DLV	Francois Tremblay	Seeing the movie &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou&quot; is an enjoyable experience, if only for the brillant soundtrack. Everyone knows the song &quot;I am a man of constant sorrow&quot;, if anything. The visuals are very well done : this is a skillfull movie.It is not just a skillfull movie, but also a witty and intelligent movie. I don't want to sound like a sycophant for saying that, but I really think it is.It has a &quot;happy-go-luck&quot; attitude as to its subject matter. It is, ostensibly, a modern version of The Odyssey, and it does spoof the Odyssey in an intelligent and somewhat credible (but most importantly, funny) manner, but it is much more than that.Some people have said it was just about laughing at rednecks, but I would say that's only the first level. The two themes I see as most important in that movie are its spoofing of the Odyssey, and skepticism/freethought (especially about religion), as exemplified by the main character.This movie is definitively enjoyable. It was nominated for two Oscars, but is evidently too much of an intelligent movie to have actually gotten any. If you are smarter than an Oscar judge, you will love this movie.	5.0	Intelligent comedy	2002-09-11	3	2	1

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3RA4OH4FDPS03	"""gastoryrguffa"""	If the thing that attracts you in Coen brothers films is the thrills or the dynamity, you better leve this one in the shop. But if you are into their movies because of the lovable characters or just the general &quot;feel to it&quot;, ou should have a go. It is not as violent or dark as Miller's Crossing or Fargo, not as sharp as Big Lebowski, but it is so sympatethic that you can't go wrong with it. There are still funny characters in it, although nothing quite hilarious as Jesus Quintana, Mike Yanagita, Marge Gunderson or Carl Showalter. The best thing in it is the music; &quot;Man Of Constant Sorrow&quot; , for example, stucked to my head instantly, although my musical taste is usually far from roots or bluegrass. Only if you are a Homer's Odyssey purist, you might be dissappointed, because although it is loosely based on it, it's far cry from it, really. This is probably the best Coen movie for those who don't even like Coen brothers' films. Highly recommended.	4.0	A laid back Coen film	2001-06-24	3	2	1
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A29RF8DYFWG0U2	gayle findley	I am not a Coen brothers fan.  I loathed &quot;Fargo,&quot; and got only a chuckle or two out of &quot;Raising Arizona.&quot;  &quot;O, Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; is an entirely different matter, though.  The art direction, production design, and set design all perfectly capture the ambiance of Mississippi in the 1930s, and the casting, from George Clooney on down to the smallest roles, is superb.  It is fanciful, funny, and sometimes even touching.  I think this film is already a comedy classic.  And then, of course, there is the music.  The soundtrack has become a hit in its own right.  Bluegrass musician Ralph Stanley has found himself to be a minor celebrity at the age of 75 because of it.  Use your imagination, sit back, relax, and enjoy,  for it is a rare comedy indeed that works as well as this one.	5.0	The Depression Was Never This Much Fun	2002-08-19	4	4	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3HYKSKAT77SFK	gbworld@comcast.net	While not normally one with extremely eclectic taste in movies, I must admit this film hit a spot with me. A retelling of Homer's Odyssey through the eyes of an escaped convict during the Great Depression. How wonderful.The basic story, for those who have never read Homer's classic work, deals with a man name Ulysses (Odyseus was his Greek name), who is forced to wander rather than return straight home. Along the way, he meets a Cyclops (John Goodman is perfect in this role) and sirens (wonderful scene). At home, his wife has been set up to wed someone whose ethics are less than sterling. And, it is all here, only a lot more humorous.In many circles, the soundtrack (wonderful bluegrass) has gained more attention than the movie. While the album is excellent, the movie also has its sterling moments.Now, this may just be a guy thing, as my wife, who had never read Homer's Odyssey (not sure how that happened) thought the movie was just plain wierd.I would love to give this film 5 stars, and probably should, but I am sure part of my adoration comes from the fact that Hollywood has churned out so much garbage lately that this film shines that much brighter in my book.	4.0	Homer rolling over in his grave	2001-12-05	3	1	2

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1VFKMHY42W2O3	"George R Dekle ""Bob Dekle"""	Three prisoners escape from a Mississippi chain gang and hurry toward a buried treasure. They must reach the treasure before a dam is completed and the treasure further buried beneath a man-made lake. Thus begins an episodic quest in which the trio confronts numerous odd and interesting characters and situations before they find a treasure more valuable than the millions they seek. The Cyclops, the Sirens, the fight with Penelope's suitors: all these adventures and more from the Oddyssey are recreated in offbeat style. The songs and music are dead on, and the movie's evocation of the rural South is realistic and idyllic at the same time. One scene where a speaker truck drove the backroads blaring out country music and political solicitations struck home to me. Riding as a child in just such a truck is my earliest remembrance of Southern politics.Graphic violence, graphic sex, surreal computer generated special effects, potty mouth dialog, heavy-handed messages on &quot;politically correct&quot; issues, commercials interwoven into the plot. A little of the foregoing can be tolerated, but in much of modern moviedom these features overpower the plot. &quot;O Brother&quot; is definitely out of step with the trends of modern film making. I understand that the critics trashed this movie. The critics cannot have been raised in the rural South.	5.0	The &quot;Oddyssey&quot; meets &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;	2001-06-17	0	0	0

It's a wonderful movie with some outstanding acting (Tim Blake Nelson was robbed of an Oscar nomination).I would like to comment about the DVD version of this movie however.  Apparently there was some kind of problem in production as there is a glitch in one scene that causes the movie to freeze as if you've hit the pause button.  I bought one the first day it came out, took it back when I noticed the problem and the replacement copy did the exact same thing at the exact same spot in the movie.I also noticed some of the color scenes seem to be out of whack.  There are some scenes where the 3 main characters look white as sheets, and the whole scene looks washed out.  I don't recall that being the case when I was watching the movie at the theater.  So I'm assuming something didn't translate well to DVD and it has altered the colors.Overall the movie is great and I wouldn't let these technical problems keep me from buying it and enjoying it.	4.0	Great Movie but DVD problems take away a star	2001-06-15	1	0	1
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2NRJPY8LPHYJL	ghtx	It sounds cool, right? The Coen Brothers (&quot;Fargo,&quot; &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;) doing a retelling of Homer's The Odyssey, set in depression-era Mississippi, filled with a stellar soundtrack, the usual Coen cast plus George Clooney, and an homage to Preston Sturges. And it is pretty cool, but it's not great, and perhaps doesn't live up to its expectations. Undeniably, the music in the film is fantastic, and the soundtrack album is well worth buying. Clooney turns in a great performance in his first outing with the Brothers, and John Turturro, Holly Hunter, and John Goodman are great as well. Any fan of Homer or Sturges would be proud. However, the movie seems to fall short of what the viewer wants. It lacks the humor and the precise attention to complex and fascinating characters that we found in previous Coen Brothers films. The three bumbling escapees (Clooney, Turturro, and Tim Clarke Duncan) are the expected dim-witted good-hearted Southerners, and in the course of their odyssey to uncover the $1.2 million that Clooney stole and buried, meet a fanciful enough cast of weirdos. There's no laugh-out-loud oddballisms, no endearingly pathetic losers, no poorly thought out crime capers, to keep us really engaged. If it weren't for the music, I'd have checked out. In short, the film's worth seeing, but not keeping. Hey, we can't expect the best of these guys all the time.	3.0	Decent, but expect more from Joel and Ethan	2001-07-15	6	3	3

For soundtrack and cinematography alone the movie could take awards.  But it's greatest acheivement is the performance of the actors and the very hilarious dialalogues and scenarios that run throughout the movie.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3VJZVVZZLVTYK	"""greysky6"""	All in all, I thought this was a fairly successful film. It is an adaptation of Homer's &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, set in the early 1900's South. It follows the journey of three chain-gang escapees, searching for a treasure that will help them get their lives back on track. What they encounter and find on their journey is unexpected, but all the more entertaining.Though this film seem's very strange at times, when one considers that it is based on such a early epic as &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, it is easy to understand why it appears this way. Upon closer attention, you realize that the way the story is adapted from the original is clever and engaging. Not to mention, at times hilariously funny. The film also succeeds with its strange but fitting acting, and its beautiful settings.Fans of the Coen Brothers' other works will find this movie to be a funny and unexpected escape from the boring usual fare.	4.0	A New Twist On Homer	2001-08-08	1	1	0

Such as: George Clooney's &quot;modern,&quot; &quot;sophisticated&quot; character, vain and verbose, is contrasted to the simple spirituality of his jailbreak companions, and of the era, and is found wanting; his agnosticism falters in the face of death, and, having been spared, reverts back to his unbelief; his companions are &quot;holy fools,&quot; who find their faith rewarded; a haunting scene where the KKK is doing a group dance, and the leader is singing a creepy spiritual ... full of surprises, subtle (and otherwise) humor, and some very memorable images.Not to mention how the movie is infused with bluegrass, blues, etc. which captures the atmosphere wonderfully. Our heroes purported hit, &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow,&quot; is quite a catchy number, one that you might want to watch and hear over and over. John Turturro's dancing accompaniment to Clooney's crooning (near the end) is hilarious.The film was also digitally processed to show the exact colorings wanted by the directors.A great DVD ... if only it had a commentary track!	5.0	Amazing and haunting.	2001-06-15	0	0	0

I am a big fan of the Coen bros. style, but unfortunately, this film was a disappointment if there ever was one. The story is original, but is destroyed by stupid cameos and unfunny one-liners. The film is also very offensive at times. Every character seems to have a look of mental disability on his face. This is not funny, it's downright stupid and has no meaning. All the other Coen bros. films have meanings for their characters to have funny looks or funny faces but O Brother, Where Art Thou? does not explain anything whatsoever. And there's a scene where a cow gets run over by a car whilst the boys are being shot at. This is totally a totally gut-wrenching scene, all the audience - about 12 people where in the theatre - looked away from the screen, no laughs going on. I guess the Coen bros. think they can get away with anything now, after all their success. Tim Blake Nelson is the only really impressive performer. George Clooney can sing really well, but him acting in a Coen bros. film is a bit beyond the pale. So, what's good?

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A18MBO1U4DPY20	Harkanwar Anand	"I saw this movie last Saturday and I think it has one of the most originally amusing scenes to start the film with.The movie has three well defined characters.I'll speak more about them.The movie recreates the distant past in a way quite extraordinary.I think its a travellor's movie and the three run into a lot of characters. I laughed out loud while watching two scenes in the film.I liked the mini Satan show. Those who've seen the movie just might follow what I said.Enjoyed the Baptism bit and I think the music played throughout the film is quite inspiring and adds to the mood of the movie.Where the movie lacked was in coming to the conclusion.I wasn't too impressed with the flood scene. The last scene in the film with the blind man on the railway tracks was moving in a way.Overall, this film is the kind I wont give a second watch anytime in the near future. It made me realise Clooney isnt a bad actor and the character who played ""George Nelson"" was my favourite(short role)though. I liked the cars and cows collision too.Replayed it thrice.Can't make out whether its special effects or not.Well Done , Coen's"	3.0	"""We Thought You Was A Toad"" (3 and a half stars)"	2005-02-28	3	1	2

Mr. Clooney has you believing in his character's zany attempt to get out of prision and make it back to his family before his wife marries a &#34;bon-e-fied&#34; (as one of his six daughters says her moma calls him) suitor.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3NIU8O31SVXP7	Hedley Lamarr	Every few years, among the dung heap of crappy movies comes along a masterpiece. This is one of them. Ok, it's not Gone With The Wind, but it's still a classic.  You leave the film wanting more, but knowing a sequel would be a let down. You play back certain parts in your mind, and you wish to watch the movie over, and when you do, you take away even more from the film - my definition of a classic. Who would give this less than 4 stars? I knew it before I even looked, but I looked anyway - Holy-rollers. They can't stand anything that slaps religion in the face.  I've been saved.... My sins have been washed away..... even from that piggly wiggly I robbed.... If you can't laugh at something like that, either get the starch out of your collar, or don't buy or rent movies.

I love, love, love the art direction in this movie.  The scenes are beautifully set up.  And the music is amazing.  My teen daughter watched this in English at school and also loves it and likes the music.  This movie made this music cool to teens, which is pretty impressive.  There's not much plot, it's more of a character study.  Think of it like an extended music video with a little bit of a plot.  I'm wanting to watch it again after reviewing it.

The BRILLIANT ACTING--GEORGE CLOONEY (HE has the capacity to be so wonderfully self deprecating), JOHN TURTURRO and TIM BLAKE NELSON--all of them could not have been more PERFECT.

The humor can only be fully appreciated by those fortunate enough to remember Mississippi in the ""Old South"" period.  Each time I watch it I have trouble breathing due to laughter beyond my control.  The writers, actors, director and all involved in the production of this film created an almost perfect portrayal of the state during the years of the great depression with one exception.  There are no rocks or stones of any type or kind in the Mississippi Delta where the state prison is located.  At the beginning of the movie they were ""busting rocks"" which made a great scene to set up the story line.  However, I noticed those particular rocks and they are quarried in Arkansas Ozark Mountains."	5.0	Destined to become an all time clasic	2014-03-14	0	0	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2VLM3Z7KYN98P	H R Kuehne	My 5 stars nothwithstanding, this movie has several flaws -- Clooney's worked-beyond-the-point-of-death pomade fetish being only the most obvious and grating. What it also has, though, is several scenes that are nothing less than astonishing. At the top of my personal list (I'm sure you have or will have your own) is &quot;Down in the River to Pray.&quot; I have not listened to the CD &quot;soundtrack&quot; of this movie, but, reading the reviews, I get the idea that Alison Krauss pretty much took over the song there. If true, that's a shame, but whether it is or not, the visual element is so strong -- and so essential to the subsequent progress of the movie -- that no audio-only rendering could possibly duplicate the experience of the DVD. In this scene, the faithful &quot;materialize&quot; out of the woods -- and out of your rear speakers if you have a surround system -- to involve you personally. In their white robes (which costumes are repeated later in somewhat less harmonious circumstances -- a &quot;coincidence&quot; that I'm sure was NOT lost on the Coens), the congregation represent the ingenuous best in depression-era southern culture.Hmmm, I guess I better quit this review now, before I talk myself out of the 5 stars. ;)	5.0	Care for Some Gopher?	2001-09-01	0	0	0

But this movie doesn't stick in your mind like the Coens' better efforts.Great movies have moments that stick with you long after the movie is done. In &quot;Barton&quot;, it's the flaming hotel hallway with John Goodman on a murderous rampage walking through it. In &quot;Fargo&quot;, it's a pregnant policewoman walking through snow drifts; a desperate woman trying to escape from kidnappers while wrapped in a shower curtain; a man being fed into a woodchipper.This movie, while fun, and at some points quite funny, just comes up short on those kind of moments.

He can act and act well.  Even his country accent is on the mark.He reflects a boyish wonder throughout the whole movie.  Yet, you know that he is in charge all the time.John Goodman has a colorful part in this movie, too.  He is a bible salesman who is anything but christian.  He plays his part very well.  He was a good choice.Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou is a wonderful movie.  It keeps you watching and wondering what these three fools will do next.The music is very good, too.

It might actually revive the art of 3-part harmony.Everyone in it looks like he's having the time of his life. I can't look at Tim Blake Nelson w/o laughing, & his singing voice is beguiling. George Clooney is PERFECT, Charles Durning is stupendous, Holly Hunter is--as always-- marvelous, and I think the guy who plays the blind manager of WEZY & that unforgettable woman in the bank who whispers, ""That's Baby Face Nelson"", deserve a new category of Oscars: ""Best One-Minute-or-Less Performance"".I love the women's shapeless feedsack dresses & faces w/o makeup. I love the baptismal procession to ""Down in the River to Pray"" (best song in the movie, though that's a close one).

I, for one, can't get enough of the gubernatorial candidates - whether it's Homer &quot;Soyvant(sic) of the Little Man&quot; Stokes or Menelaus &quot;Pass The Biscuits&quot; Pappy O'Daniel. All of the film's characters stick to memory like glue - Delmar, Wash and Pete Hogwallop, and Everett - there really is no role in this film that's insignificant.If DVD's were at all like video tapes, the underside of my disc would probably be all scratched by now.It's difficult to describe how funny this film truly is - you will probably understand only if you already have seen some other Coen Brothers films. But I can't commend this film enough - let me just say that every person should see it at least once - just be ready to laugh until you pass out.In conclusion, I should add that the soundtrack to this film is also excellent.

We all, after all, know LA intimately through &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;.OBWAT captures the American culture in a much more colorful and deeper way than &quot;Fargo&quot; does. It addresses governance; in some obvious ways, but also more subtly, alluding to the effects of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), with it's zeal for dam- building on the lives of landowners. Any reader/watcher of the popular &quot;Cadillac Desert&quot; book/PBS-series would catch that.But what has this to do with Tarkovsky? Yes, what about the religious procession in the forest to the river? What about the hope and optimism that Clooneys character? The quest for redemption? Each is very evocative of scenes and major themes in Tarkovskys &quot;Andrey Rublev&quot;. No, I'm not accusing the Coens of plagiarism, but rather I'd like you to consider the parallels between the two diverse Russian and American cultures.	5.0	Tarkovskys Cadillac Desert?	2001-07-10	2	1	1

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2X3025TZFOQ1O	"Jacob A. ""braintoad"""	First off let me say the movie is beautiful. The cinematography is great and the faded and brown overtones, which the whole film is shot in, give it a really rustic and homey feel. THe movie was casted perfectly, and every character coems to vibrant life. It really feels like your travelling down south in the early 30's or 40's. The crowning achievement on the film is the soundtrack. Aside from the &quot;man of constant sorrow&quot; song, which is heard several times throughtout the film, the backround music as well as the songs sung by the supporting cast are all excellent. They really immerse the audience into the movie.  The disc itself is good as far as dvd's go. THe picture is very crisp, and looks beautiul on any tv. the sound wasn't mind blowing but was very good. Extras are there but they are kinda boring unless you're really interested in the computer generated elements of the film. The best extra is the music video which is fun but not stupendous.I'd say the majority of people will at least kinda enjoy the movie, even if they dont love it. In the same vein as the hudsucker proxy and Raising Arizona, O brother is a whimsical journey through the back country. Fun, Fast paced, and full of good music, if nothing else you gotta rent the film.	5.0	The Lighter Side	2002-01-10	1	1	0

O' Brother Where Art Thou?, does not fall short st all. It is a very funny romp and the Acamedy thought so too. O' Brother Where Art Thou?, was nominated for two Acamedy awards and robbed of both. It was nominated for Best Screenplay and Best Cinemotography.The story follows three prisioners that become disenchanted by the daily drudge of crushing rocks on a prision farm in Mississippi, the dapper, silver-tongued Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney) heads up the jail break. The problem is that they are still shackeled together from when they were in a chain gang- bad tempered Pete (John Turturro) and sweet, dim-witted Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson). With nothing to loose and a buried loot to gain-before it's lost forever in a flood-the three embark on the adventure of a lifetime in this hillariuos offbeat road comedy. Populated with quirky characters (as seen in the Cohen brothers othe masterpiece Fargo), including a blind prophet, sexy sirens, and a one-eyed Bible salesmen (Johm Goodman), it's an odyssey filled with chases, close calls, near misses, and betrayel that should be missed by anyone.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1A535W556ROBQ	James Ferguson	The Coen Brothers have done some pretty audacious movies, but this may just be there most audacious yet, as they take on the great book, The Odyssey, and do a might fine job of it in depression-era Mississippi. George Clooney is Ulysses, but of course one can't take him too seriously in the role.  He gets some fine help from John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, as the three convicts make their escape from a chain gang.  Along the way we are introduced to a strange assortment of characters (What would you expect?) held together by a well-conceived storyline that doesn't fail to deliver a fine ending.  T-Bone Burnett provides an inspiring Folk and Prison Blues soundtrack that resurrected James Carter singing Po Lazarus.  While the movie has more than a passing nod to Sullivan's Travels, it moves along at its own brisk pace, as the hapless trio seek its redemption via a series of obstacles that would have made old Preston Sturges smile.	5.0	A crazy mixed up world	2004-09-18	12	11	1
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2WIA1X9OHMIOT	"James Flanagan ""jamesf991"""	As an admitted fan of &quot;art&quot; and &quot;cult&quot; films, I enjoyed O  Brother very much. The occasional disjointed dialog reminded me of theater of the absurd or the X-files at its most ponderous. The music, of course, was superb, and George Clooney seemed to look more and more like Clark Gable as the movie wore on. The rest of the ensemble was excellent as well. The audience went out smiling.One American movie that I can compare it to was &quot;Cannery Row&quot; with Nick Nolte and Debra Winger. If you enjoyed O Brother, you'll probably like Cannery Row as well.Five Stars.	5.0	A wonderful little film	2001-07-07	4	3	1

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	AXCNYOFET1LI2	James M. Cauhorn	If you are looking for subtle humor, classic parody, or just want to see George Clooney in a role quite unlike any other he has ever played, this movie is for you.  Losely based on Homer's &quot;Odyssey,&quot; the story line revolves around early 20th century back-woods prison escapees and their adventures while eluding recapture.  I found the film to be very funny visually as well as with the clever writing.  Clooney was terrific in his strange role.  I bought the DVD after having seen the movie in the theater.  Enjoyed it even more watching it at home.	5.0	Something different	2001-07-02	1	1	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	AQ01Q3070LT29	James McDonald	"If it wasn't for George Clooney, I probably would not have watched this film.  This film I'm sure was well intended.  However, since my family and myself in part came out of Kentucky and some thereabouts, I found this film depressing.  I do understand the comedy they are making in the film.  But, this film is also real and was real.  Depends on where you lived and how you lived.  The music is fine.  That is what country music used to be.  DVD contains the music video performed by Soggy Bottom Boys, ""I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow"", an 8-minute featurette on the production, and another 9-minute featurette ""Painting With Pixels"" on getting that old, dusty Kentucky look, the digital way."	3.0	Where art thou, life, money and comedy?	2003-08-28	5	0	5

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1EBJ93E1T50RT	Jason A. Miller	"Each recent Coen Brothers film mirrors the one before it.  ""Fargo"" was a dark comic tale with one million dollars at its center.  ""The Big Lebowski"" was a comic tale with one million dollars at its center (in both cases that center included Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare).  ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", however, is different.  It begins with a search for one-point-TWO million dollars.""The Odyssey"" meets ""The Three Stooges"" meets Delta-blues-and-bluegrass meets Robert Altman's ""Thieves Like Us"", the latest Coen offerent almost defies conventional description.  Like ""Big Lebowski"", it's best viewed as a collection of anecdotes, and it doesn't really ends, so much as cuts to the closing credits at a logical breaking-off point.Three escaped convicts bumble around parched Mississip in 1937.  Their lead is played surprisingly well by George Clooney, who's covered in dirt, stubble, and Dapper Dan pomade from beginning to end.  John Turturro is rather muted, dropping out of the middle section entirely.  Tim Blake Nelson, playing the ""dumb"" one (similar to Steve Buscemi's role in ""Lebowski""), was previously unknown to me but stole nearly every scene he was in.  The movie's signature line belongs to him:  ""Oh, George, not the livestock!""The supporting roles are all Coen Brothers returnees: John Goodman, Holly Hunter, Charles Durning, and of course they steal all their scenes as well.  You'll never want for great acting in a Coen Brothers movie and this is one of their stronger casts.The DVD contains a couple of interesting features, and I say this without having watched the multi-angle storyboards.  The cinematography featurette is an eye-opener, pointing out details in the film's color scheme I would not have noticed on my own.  It's also so earnest that you'll be forgiven for thinking it's another Coen Brothers DVD-extra hoax a la the ""Blood Simple"" disc.  The making-of featurette contains an interview with the Coens themselves, most intriguing of all.  I am grateful for their appearance -- unlike their next film, this time they are not the Men Who Weren't There."	4.0	"""Oh, George, not the livestock"""	2002-01-28	1	1	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A18OUQEK7IZ2F2	"Jason Kirkfield ""The Pride and Sorrow of chil..."	"* By ""Dummies"" I don't mean viewers have to be dumb to watch it; rather, I am referring to the popular series of books published by IDG Books during the 1990s, which made technology and later varied subjects accessible to readers. To that end, making this film required viewing in schools might get kids interested in classic literature. The lesson plan could even include watching ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" then reading Homer's Odyssey.Still, this film is different than most of what shows up in theaters, and thus not everyone will love it, at least not on first viewing. I thought Clooney's character was over the top, and was disappointed to learn that he was the only one who didn't do his own singing. Great supporting roles all around, though.To me, the best part is the music (2001 Grammy for Album of the Year).O Brother, Where Art Thou?As for the disc itself, this was the first and so far only DVD release in this country, and it is practically screaming out for a multi-voice commentary. Perhaps Buena Vista is waiting to release a 10th Anniversary Edition this year? Rating: 3.5 stars, rounded down until they come out with a better DVD."	3.0	The Odyssey for Dummies*	2009-09-21	2	0	2

This is a not a run of the mill film, and I think what happened is they let a run of the mill marketing group handle the publicity for it.  It is really not a fugitive story, which is what everything from the cover to the commercials had me thinking.  This movie has good humor, a likeable story and great old-timey and gospel music (and I don't listen to either of those and still thought they were great).  The Siren Scene was my favorite.There is only one fault I can find with this movie: The last scene in the old cabin in the valley was completely unnecessary for the story and I would have enjoyed this movie more without it.  We did not need to bring that plot line to a close, it was satisfying enough before.  I felt that the scene was a gratuitous excuse to throw in another song or draw the movie out another 5 minutes to meet some kind of quota.One fault not withstanding, this one is a gem.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	AYVFNOQHY8P3	J. Christal	This is Joel and Ethan Coen's best film behind Blood Simple, Fargo, Raising Arizona, and The Man Who Wasn't There.  The Coen Brothers have a pretty good film here, recommendable to say the least.  It is a good-natured odyssey inspired by the one by Homer, about 3 convicts (George Clooney looking like Clarke Gable, John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson) who escape the chain gang in 1930's south to go look for hidden treasure, even if there are distractions along the way.  Those include becoming blue-grass singers, John Goodman as the Cyclops and a trip of singing sirens on a river.  About the 4th best film in the ring of Coen bros.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2WJSVSBXEYEF	Jefferson T. Packer	"This film passes almost like a dream - if dreams were spiked with slapstick humor.  It evokes, more powerfully than anything I have ever seen, the essence of an America that is no more.  Which is both a good and a bad thing.It's a good thing because no one in their right mind would want to go back to the era before the Civil Rights Movement changed the face of the south and put old Jim Crow to rest.It's a bad thing because television, air conditioning and sealed up cars have basically ended society, and left us with a thin, fragile shell of a community.In 1930's America, there was nothing to do on a hot summer night but sit on the front porch, drink lemonade, and talk with your neighbors who were out walking, looking for a breeze.On Saturday, there was nothing to do but go into town with your children and see everyone out walking around downtown, going from store to store on the sidewalk (imagine that...)On Sunday, you went to the church of your choice, where you tried to worship the Lord over the rustling sound of whispered gossip, some of it about you and yours.It was a socially tight, often restrictive world; but it was a world that was focused and centered around people relating to each other; not around gameboys, X-boxes, PC's, cellphone IM's, or sitting alone in your house on a beautiful summer night with all the windows down tight, the AC on full blast and the TV making that flickering, eerie blue light in your curtains.""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"" reminds us both of what we are so glad is over, and of what almost all of us miss on some subconscious level in our hearts; the feeling of being a part of a community."	5.0	Like a dream	2005-08-08	9	8	1

Dixon ""Jess Dixon"""	"O Brother, Where Art Thou? starring George Clooney, Tohn Turtubro, Tim Blake Nelson and John Goodman with Holley Hunter, is an unusual, twist of lemon, kind of off kilter comedy that when a loaned copy was not return, I had my wife buy another one for us to view throughout the year as a repeat movie.  For us, it ranks with ""My Cousin Vinny.""George Clooney's fixation with his hair and his claim to being a ""Dapper Dan"" man, and the crack-up line, repeated ""We thought you was a TOAD!""  the FUN music, makes it a HIT FLICK! It includes bazaar things like when the three escaped chain-gang prisoners are unaware that they have become over night recording stars, and Clooney, finding his three little girls, is shocked to hear that his wife told them ""Daddy was run over by a train,"" and has found a new boyfriend who is ""bonified,"" suggesting their ""now alive Daddy"" is not!, fires Clooney with renewed zeal to re-capture the love of his wife and have his family back together once again. Clooney's character convinces the other two prisoners all chained together, (which forces them all to escape together on Clooney's lead) - that he is going to retrieve a lost treasure.If you have kids, they will laugh along with you throughout this movie.  The characters, the baptisms in the river, the eating of gophers over a camp fire, and Clooney's constant obsession with ""My hair!"" just makes for a really FUN movie.  So much so, that after just writing this I'm tempted to watch it again this weekend!  A clean, but really unusual, very funny movie!  It provides quaint lines in the script, that, if you are anything like my wife and I, you will find yourself tossing out to each other or other family members at those ""perfect moments in life when comedy is in order""  (I thought you was a Toad! for instance!)

It's rare to find a movie that hits a home run visually, musically, with a wonderful story AND superb acting. The movie pulls you into the characters' lives (and what characters they are) and the deeper undertones of life and times in the South add a certain poignancy and depth to a wonderfully unique and engrossing story. And speaking of the acting...I am a fan of George Clooney and thought he was an adequate actor but was blown away by his performance in &quot;O Brother.&quot; The highest praise I can offer is that I forgot it was &quot;George Clooney&quot; in the part -- he took over his role and made it his own, and certainly deserved his Golden Globe. This movie offers qualities often missing in many if not most cinematic offerings today: uniqueness, quality and depth.

I've seen O Brother four times already, and I can't wait for the DVD.  I was recently introduced to Cohen films by a good friend who knows just about everything about film.  He slips the Cohens into our movie nights--- I haven't been disappointed yet.  The Cohens have crafted a film that is both entertaining and cognitive- I laugh until I cry yet I am made to think- two things you don't often get in the same movie.  To say that this film is boring translates into the ideas that there is nothing intruiging about human nature, that life deserves no more than a sigh, and that there is nothing funny about existence and the paths that we take.  Human nature is and always will be something to be pondered and something to be smiled at.  The Cohens have given us another chance to do that.  It's dangerous ground to mess with a classic, but they have pulled it off beautifully with a tale that I think even Homer himself would approve of.	5.0	R-U-N-N-O-F-T and see this film!	2001-05-01	4	3	1

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A311QTXJK64LRM	Jim Butler	will be required.  This is a very funny highly enjoyable movie.  You cannot watch it just once to fully appreciate the whole thing.  To get all that is in this movie you need to own it.  The first viewing will just whet your appetite, if it doesn't trust me and watch it again.  You enjoyment will grow with each viewing.  The story centers around Everett McGill (Clooney) trying to get back to his wife and some buried treasure.  To accomplish this he brings his prison buddies who are shackled to him (Turtorro and Nelson).  This trio finds adventure and humor in the Klan, Bad politicians, loose women, backstabbing family, Bible salesmen, and all manner of quirky characters on their journey.  The characters are wonderful. The performances by the entire cast are fantastic.  This is not a George Clooney movie you have come to expect.  He is so different and fresh and funny you won't expect the performance you are seeing.  His costars are equally perfect. You will find yourself reciting lines from the movie that are bound to become classics.  On top of all this is the music.  This is bluegrass and oldtimey sounds.  I realize that most people are probably not fans of this type stuff and honestly neither was I, but the Coen brothers make it work.  The music is half the fun.  I find myself singing the songs around the house.  It is a movie that can be watched by the family.  There area  few bits of profanity, not too much but the story and the humor and especially the music can be enjoyed by everyone.	5.0	Repeated viewings.....	2001-08-20	15	14	1
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A59LBV682DWGM	Jimmy E Ayala	From beginning to the end, this movie is a hoot!The story is loosely based on Homer's The Odyssey. George Clooney is Ulysses. who is trying to go home to his wife. On the way he has adventures. The Sirens call. Those three women washing clothes in the water are  the Sirens. John Goodman is the Cyclops, the one eyed monster. Clooney's wife is Penelope. The blind man on the handcar on the train track is Homer.I have watched this movie three times in three weeks. It makes me feel good.Notice the order of the scenes: day, night, day, night, day, no night, day, night, day, night, and day.In the first half of the movie, the three men fear the day. They have escaped the chain gang and they do not want to be recognized. They are more comfortable in the night in the woods around the camp fire.In the second half of the movie, the three men are more comfortable in the daytime. The fires at night have become torches of evil. The night scene of white robed and white hooded white men dancing in the woods by a burning  cross is a deep American nightmare.And the music! The songs are so deeply American. The songs make me sad, make me sleepy, make me cry, make me laugh, make me stamp my feet and stick my fingers in my mouth to whistle as loud as I can.That may be why this movie attracts me so. The scenes are icons of such deep American imagery.: chain gangs, apple pie cooling in the window, flat farmland, model T Fords,  burning crosses,  lynch mobs, etc.I repeat, this movie makes me feel good. Every image is uniquely American . The music is uniquely American.  It makes me feel good to be American.This movie is a hoot!	5.0	This Movie Is A Hoot!	2002-07-13	3	3	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	ACIVY289F6728	J.J. Hanson	This was one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen lately. Funny, original, and delighful. I loved the &quot;old timey&quot; music, and the bleached out color of the film was perfect for this era. This was probably the best role (so far) that George Clooney has ever had, and Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson were the best! Charles Durning did his usual great acting job. Kudos to the &quot;bit part&quot; actors...John Goodman as the con man and Michael Badalucco in the role of Pretty Boy Floyd were terrific. Who ever did the casting for this pix was right on the money! I received the DVD of this movie for my birthday and have watched it several times. I never get tired of the story, the music or just the pure fun! Bravo to the Coen brothers...lets have more of your efforts.	4.0	A &quot;feel good&quot; film	2002-02-08	1	1	0

I had rented it because lots of folks touted the bluegrass aspect, which I did enjoy and therefore gave it 2 stars.  But, after George Clooney (Dan Tyminski) sang at the radio station the movie just went down hill.  When the scene with the cows getting run over arrived I almost decided to turn it off, but my teenaged nephew asked to watch a bit more.  However, things just got more disappointing after that and we ended up turning it off before it finished.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.

Well, barely 10 minutes into the show, we both looked at each other and said, &quot;Wow!, this is actually a REALLY good movie!&quot; We both agreed that on a scale of 1 to 10, this is definately a &quot;10&quot; movie. It's defiately going to be in both our DVD collections.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	AIWRBCDSPCDRE	"John Adams ""Farley Flavors"""	Joel and Ethan Cohen have taken us into the inner depths of Americana. From the Cold recesses in the Midwest in &quot;Fargo,&quot; the bland suburbs of LA in &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; and the solitude of the deserts in &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;. Now The Coens have taken us into the heart of the Deep South in the 1930's in an imaginative and surrealistic telling of one of the original novels in the history of writing.Obviously it took the Coens a while to properly concieve Homer's &quot;Odyssey&quot; not only in a different setting but as a comedy which boasts a surprisingly piquant wit. Well they've managed to do it in an almost seamless manner. As you can see the Coens wasted no time in setting the scene. Opening with sweeping crane, and still shots of a chain gang singing their haunting melody. Then soon we jump to a montage of our heroes Ulysses Everett McGill, Pete Hogswallop, and Delmar O'Donnell, making a discreet yet clumsy escape from &quot;The Farm&quot; while incorporated with richly authentic, old-timey music. It shows us that these three men obviously have a long difficult path to follow. Then post-credits we are immediately supplied with a hilarious physical gag right out of the gate. Then soon we finally get the taste of the trio's personalities. spontaneously you see that Everett is a proud man who attempts to be intellectually inclined. Then you have Pete, who's highly rough-around-the-edges. The there's the clueless but good-hearted Delmar. Immediately they set up the characters likeability within the first five minutes with the sparkling dialogue. Which has become a staple in the Coen Brothers' illustrious careers.Aside from the films delightful surprises you get to see some of our favorite actors, new and old, playing charaters that go beyond unique. Probably the one most worth mentioning is George Clooney as Everett. The casting job couldn't have been more perfect(Clooney now has a Golden Globe to prove it). As you watch him boast and brag you see the constant look that states that he's so sure that he is right all the time.  When in reality the opposite is the truth. Next there's John Tuturro as Pete. His stance and his gruff tone display his harsh, rough upbrining. Which explains his tendency to lash out. finally there's Tim Blake Nelson (Director of &quot;O&quot;) and his performance as Delmar. Nelson's performance is dead-on target. even when he's handing George &quot;babyface&quot; Nelson his Tommy Gun, he still asks what George's profession is after George opens fire on the police giving chase then on helpless livestock. And you can see the childlike innocence on his face when he whimpers &quot;Oh, George, Not the Livestock.&quot;And even the otherwordly characters from the basis novel. make unique and symbolic appearances from the blind wandering prophet, the Cyclops (played to perfection by Coens Alumi John Goodman.), plus the standout scene of the three sirens singing seducing and sedating our three heroes. &quot;Those Sirens loved him up and turned him into a... Horny Toad!&quot;You gotta love the utter creativity and originality that was put into this film. I won't go around saying that everyone will enjoy this film because it's a confirmed fact that The Coen Brother's films are an aquired taste. Only the intellectually inclined will find this film to be a hilarious romp. But if you have an open mind, don't hesitate to give it a try.	5.0	A Comedy For Those With &quot;The Capacity For Abstract Thought&quot;	2001-10-09	20	18	2

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2TDK8D4HEMUYW	"John ""MovieAddict"""	"I haven't seen many of the Coen Brothers' films, although one of the two I have seen is one of my favorites (&quot;Fargo&quot;), and the other I've seen is one I don't care for very much (&quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;). One of the films has a lot of humor, the other doesn't. One of the films is extremely entertaining; the other is just sort of boring.&quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; is a retelling of Homer's &quot;Odyssey,&quot; or &quot;Homer's Odyssey,&quot; since you never see the title without the name preceding it anymore; Homer's name is practically part of the title, now. Am I digressing?It starts with three runaway convicts, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro), and Delmer (Tim Blake Nelson). Everett - as his chumps call him - has a strange fascination with his own hair, and Dapper Dan hair cream. &quot;I'm a Dapper Dan Man!&quot; he proclaims after being offered another brand of hair cream by a store clerk (who unfortunately doesn't carry Dapper Dan but looks as if he couldn't give a hoot either way). And, in another one of the film's few funny scenes, we see local police picking up a trail on the threesome after a bloodhound finds a tin can of Dapper Dan and a hairnet lying by a diminished fire.The trio has escaped from jail in hopes of finding an ancient treasure not delved into by the film so very much. Along the way they meet an odd assortment of characters, including a black guitarist who sold his soul to Satan so that he could learn to play guitar; a baby-faced criminal trying to make a name for himself; and a bulky thief (John Goodman) who steels what little fortunes the men have achieved by singing on the radio under the combined name of The Soggy Bottom Boys.Along the way they also encounter Everett's wife (Holly Hunter), who claims he was hit by a train, tells her seven children this, and refuses to acknowledge him as her husband. With the law in hot pursuit of them, the boys have only their brains to fall back on - and they don't have much of that available for use.The plot's not the problem with the film (per se). It has fun with itself; the bluegrass music is perfect for the film and makes you feel like you're in Mississippi. The problem is the way the film has a million different ideas going on that it never seems able to make sense of. The film takes spiritual detours that pay off at the end, but nothing is ever truly resolved. In one scene towards the overdue finale, Everett gets down on his knees and prays to God to deliver them from their doom. Suddenly a gigantic tidal wave roars through and demolishes their surroundings, leaving them alive and bobbing on the water's surface.I've read &quot;The Odyssey,&quot; but even with all its weirdness in mind I don't remember it being this weird. It's been a while, yes, but I don't remember a giant tidal wave and I certainly don't think it belongs in a feature film with enough wasted ideas. At least ""The Odyssey"" was weird for a reason - ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" could certainly do without the strangeness.Every time George Clooney is on-screen you'll be having some minimal amount of fun at least, but when he's gone and the film takes its time rooting through some unimportant sub-plots, it gets to be a real bore. It's not even two hours long but it feels like it's three.The plus side? Depression-era Mississippi comes alive, and in some scenes the dry filming makes you thirsty for a glass of cold water. Not only that, but just as in &quot;Fargo,&quot; the Coen Brothers are able to make us feel a sort of attachment to the characters - but even with Everett's funny infatuation with hair gel, he's not in the same league as Marge Gunderson, and he never will be.The first time I saw this movie in 2000 (the year of its release), I absolutely hated it. Back then, perhaps I was expecting something too close to &quot;Fargo.&quot; Maybe I just wanted something better. So with last night's repeat viewing, I made sure I wasn't expecting anything. I made sure I put away all pretensions. It still didn't impress me.&quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; does have some good parts, but for being a comedy it certainly doesn't have very many laughs, and for being a lightweight, uplifting drama it seems too caught up in darker ideas that don't need meddling with. And, apart from everything else, it's just plain weird. It's a whole lot different than &quot;Fargo,&quot; which might sound good since change is often welcomed from director(s). But whereas M. Night Shyamalan's &quot;Signs&quot; was different than &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; in a delightfully splendid way, &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; is sort of like George Lucas' latest installments into the extended &quot;Star Wars&quot; series. They may be different, but they're definitely not any better."	3.0	A far fall from &quot;Fargo&quot; for the Coen Brothers...	2003-12-02	15	3	12

My favorite character is Delmer, played by Tim Blake Nelson.  He was a wonderfully lovable guy, and he actually sang &quot;In the Jailhouse Now.&quot;  This is a sentimental, affectionate comedy.  I've always been a Coen brothers fan.  This film should have been up for best picture, but it's a rare day when a comedy is up for best picture.  It was also nice to see Southern people (with the exception of the kkk) depicted in a positive light.  They weren't all racists in the 30's, which is the prevailing notion.

But the Coen brothers shall set thee free if you let them.  With a tightly written script and magnificent use of color in every scene, &quot;O Brother&quot; takes us to a place so unique yet familiar.  The DVD is very well assembled, with some good behind-the-scenes stuff, including a facinating documentary called &quot;Painting with Pixels&quot; which details the exclusive use of computer color processing for the entire film(quite a challange).  The 5.1 Dolby soundtrack creates a masterful sound field which adds so much to the experience.  There is also a DTS for anyone who can decode it.  This movie is somewhat quirky, so be careful whom you spring this DVD on.

I'm glad that I was smart enough to see this one in the theater,and even on the small screen,O' Brother is just as enjoyable.Loosely based upon the epic Greek poem ""The Odessey"" by Homer,Everett,Pete and Delmar embark on an epic journey after escaping from the chain gang by overcomming their obstackles to retrieve ""the treasure"" Everett promises his more gullable partners.Strange characters and situations are experienced along the way to their long journeys end,even by accidently starting a blue grass revival by sing'in in an old timers can.Always on the run Everett,Pete and Delmar find themesleves in one mess after another after their enounter with the Oricle on the railroad,George Nelson(Baby Face Nelson) the cyclops(John Goodman) and comming accross the Sirens that no red-blooded man could resist(even I was panting durring that scene).Everett spills his guts at the end admitting there was no treasure and his sole purpose was to interveen and keep his wife from re-marrying(obvious relation to ""The Odessey"").In the end,he and his friends are pardoned,escape death and are re-born victorious.This film is a perfect ballance of story telling in the ""old timie traditions"" with the help of Homers Odessey,southern myths and legends with the obvious reference to meeting the devil at the crossroads where the legendary Robert Johnson himself sang about learning to play the guitar by selling his soul.A great cast and spectacular script along with an even more memorible soundtrack head this film.As always,the Coen brothers again master the means of timeless directing and story telling.You can't go wrong with O'Brother,well worth owning at almost any price."	4.0	We got to R,U,N,N,O,F,T	2006-12-02	1	0	1

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A17Y3OEOOAGEJ3	Joren R. Cain	I am a big fan of the Coen brothers, as most of the people who give movie this 4 or 5 stars are, so I may be a little bit biased.  I was not a huge fan of this movie at first; it just didn't seem as funny to me as it was intended to be.  However, after watching &quot;Sullivan's Travels&quot; recently and re-watching &quot;O Brother&quot; (to save space, I'll leave out their connection; it can be found in other reviews on Amazon), it was MUCH funnier for me-&quot;Sullivan&quot; definitely put me in the right mind-set for this.  After a few viewings, you can also pick up all the great dialog you may have missed, and you notice all the elements that are in here-Homer, &quot;old-timey&quot; music, American folklore (the crossroads, the klan, etc), road pictures, Preston Sturges' influence, and alot of the trademark Coen brothers stuff.  It seems to me that being familiar with any of these is definitely helpful in enjoying this film.  That's what gives it 5 stars for me; I'd have given it 4 stars before seeing &quot;Sullivan's Travels&quot; and really taking the time to soak everything up that's in &quot;O Brother.....&quot;	5.0	Yes, it is a good movie.	2001-12-26	0	0	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1S33479O893GE	Joseph Ganakos	I find it interesting that this film has polarized the viewing public.  Alternately touted as the 'best film of the year' and the 'worst', I didn't know quite what to expect when I sat down to watch &quot;O Brother.&quot;  While its themes are thousands of years old (due to its loosely adapted Homerian plot) its placement in the Depression-era South is as intellectually stimulating and entertaining as one could possibly expect.  The music is so good that I won't even bother to comment on it save that everyone should purchase the soundtrack.  But the film itself is what sold me as living up to the accolades that many critics (both professional and amateur) have heaped upon this film.  The characterizations are tremendous, the representation of numerous real-life characters and Southern archetypes (the 'Robert Johnson' bluesman who sells his soul or the 'Kingfish' demagogue) are dead on target, and the individual performances are tremendous.  John Goodman does some of his most compelling work as does George Clooney.  But the people that stole the show for me were John Turturro and Charles Durning; their characters were as rich as the script allowed and made me appreciate both the intent of the script and its tangible outcome.  My best advice is to ignore everyone's opinion and watch it yourself.  If you're like the rest of the reviewers (including mine) you'll either love it or hate it.  I think its easy to see in which camp my review falls.  My guess is that if you give this movie half a chance you'll have no choice but to buy the DVD when it gets released.	5.0	Serious kudos to the Coen Brothers	2001-05-24	1	0	1

OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU is loosley based on one of the oldest stories ever recorded by man THE ODDYSSY BY HOMER. instead of odysseus trying his best to return to his wife in ithica greece, george clooney plays ulysses everret mcgill, an escapee from a chain gang in 1930,s misissippi who with 2 friends is doing his best to get to his wife who has divorced him to try and get back together again. clooney is witty ,fuuny and just about as great as youll ever see him. listen to his dialogue as he wisecracks his way through the film and youll just find yourself laughing out loud. the photography is outstanding and has a sureal quality to it. the soundtrack is early american folk gospel and country and its just great to listen to. john turturo and john goodman are the usual cohen regulars. john goodman is outstanding as a parable to the cylops in the original oddyssy. just as in the original oddyssy there are sirens, strange caracters and a mysterious blind man who predicts theire future. great music,great photography and an oddbeat funny film with outstanding acting and dialogue. the cohen brothers are if anything always unique	5.0	clooney is soooo cool	2006-03-14	3	3	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A75FAUW3VXNKL	Joshua M. Clark	I just saw this movie for the first time. The music is, of course, one of the centerpieces of the movie, and it is incredible. If you love bluegrass and folk music, you will not be dissatisfied with the supply in this movie.I also enjoyed the portrayal of human nature, especially in connection with Christianity. Although the salvation and subsequent baptism of two of the main characters was admittedly quite shallow, the foolishness and hypocrisy of the third character was clearly shown, as in the end he winds up praying for a miracle, receives it, and then attributes it to physical forces apart from God's control. This is certainly a foolish action by the character, but the Coen brothers expressed it as foolishness, for which I am grateful.There are drawbacks, however. Since the movie is based on Homer's epic, the Odyssey, the producers had to insert a scene with the famous Sirens. They are by the water in skimpy, wet clothing, and seduce the three men. I would recommend fast-forwarding through this part. Also various unbiblical assumptions about the family and women are assumed in the actions of some of the characters, but they are really quite laughable, and I think the movie is still worth watching despite them.	4.0	Good music, good themes	2002-09-01	9	2	7

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	AJBYS5T61GAKV	J. Saxton	"This is a movie which is beautiful on all levels. The cinematography is truly astounding, in fact I believe it won an Academy Award. The story is a Depression-era South adaptation of Homer's Odyssey. It is what you would call ""loosely based"" on this epic. It is a movie that manages to be funny, odd, and heart-achingly beautiful all at the same time. The 3-stooges dynamic between Clooney, Turturro, and Nelson is excellent. Clooney proves he can do comedy, and I must admit, I was surprised. The music is also excellent; a cross-section of blues, bluegrass, and other old-country styles."	5.0	Excellent Movie!

Watching it was like chewing ice cubes while being run over by a really slow steamroller.  Trust me, I understand what the Cohen boys were trying to do with this movie, but I also understand what Facebook was trying to do when they IPO'd at a $110 billion market cap.  Failure is failure, regardless of past perception.In short, this film is a mess; and a mess that is so long that the best part of it is the closing credits because then you know it's actually over.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2840RARRE4T83	J. Shell	The Coen brothers serve up a beautifully filmed and nearly perfectly executed movie with many scenes and songs that linger in ones head.  It shows both the dark and light of the South in the depression, and reminds us of the power of the music that tried to help everyone get through the rough times.  The warmer sounds of songs like &quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain&quot; and &quot;I'll Fly Away&quot; are yearnings for that better place far away.  The premier song, &quot;Man of constant sorrow&quot;, is a great blues\bluegrass piece, with both performances by Clooney and Cohorts being enjoyably funny.  But perhaps the most impressive song and visual in this film is the baptism scene, when our heroes are suddenly surrounded by white clad Christians floating through the beautiful Southern woods like fireflies all singing a building gospel hymn &quot;Down to the river&quot; - a very mesmerizing moment.The performances are great.  Clooney has an energetic wild eyed zeal and pulls of some great rapid dialog as Ulysses.  Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro do well as the slow witted traveling companions.  Daniel von Bargen (probably known best currently for his role as the Commandant at the military school on &quot;Malcom in the Middle&quot;) fits the old image of the sherrif perfectly with his cool mannerisms, black outfit, sunglasses (the only person wearing them) and black hat.While generally funny, the film also has reminders of the effects of the depression on already poor farmers.  It also doesn't forget racial issues in the form of the KKK and how many of its members could make themselves out to be &quot;normal decent folk&quot; during the day when they weren't hiding in bedsheets carrying silly names.  Some people take offense at the KKK scene in the movie, but I thought it pointed out the silliness of these people dressing in these costumes and thinking they were superior while also showing that enough stupidity gathered together can do some pretty terrible things.  It can be an uncomfortable scene, but it does contribute to the story (and shows, through our heroes, that not *every* white person in the south was a bigot).Ultimately, this movie was an enjoyable experience for me.  I could even call it uplifting, as it's beautiful photography and soundtrack have caused me to start liking the South again and appeciate more of the Gospel and Bluegrass from the time.  I love listening to &quot;I'll Fly Away&quot; from the soundtrack and picturing soaring up over the dusty roads and fields through gold tinted lenses.	5.0	Down to the river to pray in the beautiful south	2001-04-21	60	53	7

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2OIU5OIG10YEG	"Juliana L'Heureux ""juliewriter"""	"George Clooney and his terrific co-stars in ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou?"" create colorfully believable characters who present moviegoers with a comic reflection on a period in American History we might well forget. Thank goodness for this movie because I believe the popularity of the plot along with the excellent CD movie track will keep America's dark secret of discrimination practiced in pre-World War II Mississippi from falling off our cultural landscape. Couched inside the politically correct safety blanket of colloquial comedy, the three escaped prisoners (Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson)take on individual situations of racial prejudice in Mississippi, with unlikely charm and innocence, in contrast to the seriousness of the issues. All the while they are on the lamb, the three men are becoming popular with southern country music lovers because they serendipitously recorded a song with a blind radio producer who didn't know they had latched on to a Negro guitar player - thus creating a de-segregated or ""mulatto"" performing group.  Charles Durning is a favorite actor of mine, and his performance as the incumbent Governor Pappy O'Daniel is memorable for his colorful irreverence for hyperbole but also for his refreshing political honesty. This movie is worth seeing over again because it leaves Americans with something to remember about our past - so we're not doomed to re-live it.  Although the movie is loosely based on Homer's ""Odyssey"", this analogy doesn't really cut it with the elite set - rather, this movie is about what it's about,  and I don't believe it should be given any pseudo-intellectual accoutrements. It's simply a gem."	5.0	Historic Comedy with a Memorable Plot	2006-08-19	5	4	1

I loved the story and the music that carried it along.  Not true that the Coen Brothers never read the Odyssey...that was a bit of a joke...they said in another interview that that is their favorite book, and they read it quite often.Loved the characters, but everyone seems to have the impression that it starred Clooney, Turturro, and Goodman, in that order.  They forget Tim Blake Nelson, who had most of lines -- if you don't count Everett's loquacious yammering.  In fact, Blake's character Delmar (&quot;dumber than a bag of hammers&quot;) had the best, funniest, and most provocative lines in the movie.  He also had the right accent, something most of the supposedly Mississipian characters did not.  George Cloony's was on and off, mostly off, although the actor is originally from Kentucky. (Blake is from Oklahoma and sounded dead-on just like my southern relatives.)The jacket hints that Pete (Turturro) is bad-tempered, but nothing would seem to indicate that he was.  He wasn't as adorable and innocent as Delmar, but he wasn't much brighter.This movie sings! :)	5.0	Quirky and Uplifting!	2001-11-07	3	2	1

I got a kick out of the song he sang with ""The Soggy Bottom Boys"".  Clooney has such a wide range of talent.Unlike his recent release, the remake of the 1972 classic ""Solaris"" was a lot more intense, but very good.  ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" is lighter and less taxing drama-wise.  This by no means makes any of these movies any less enjoyable.For one thing, Clooney's character is not without flaws.  He lies, cheats, and steals to get what he wants. Also, he loves to grease his hair.  It's not until his ex-wife decides to marry another man that he discovers what is really important.  In spite of his rather charming nature he still manages to be fooled by a shapely body feeding him moonshine in scantily clad, wet clothing while she harmonizes with two others of the same body type.The amazing thing about Clooney's character is he mamages to stay a few leagues ahead of the athorities.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2DKTZMMG3JHN4	K. Burns	"The first time I saw this movie, I actually thought it was quite ridiculous. I think it was because the humor was so dry.I caught it on tv again one day which started my love affair with this film. I have probably seen it at least 100 times, if not more, and it gets funnier every time I see it.My only problems with it are: 1.the Woolsworth scene is terribly edited and 2. the last scene has the McGill family missing a kid. If you count their daughters going over the train track- there's one missing?My love for this film is that there is a quote for every issue in life:When you wake up...""oh, my hair""; when you find yourself in trouble... ""we're in a tight spot"", having people problems...""only a fool seeks logic in the chambers of the human heart""; let someone down...""God forgive me""; how old you'll be in 50 years...""well, I'll only be 82""; come to spiritual knowledge...""come on in boys, the waters fine""; hostile towards cattle...""one thing I hate more than coppers is cows""; finished with an argument...""I've counted to three""; warn friends of impending danger...""do not seek the treasure""; and so on, and so on.The majority of my every day language comes from the lines in this movie and I find that is all the language I need."	5.0	My Favorite Movie of All Time	2009-10-20	3	3	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A13EUSV15UDAUG	"kennedy19 ""kennedy19"""	Fans of the Coen brothers are sure to enjoy this offbeat movie, which tells the tale of three escaped cons in the south during the depression who somehow get mixed up with Missippi politics, the Klan, popular music, con men, and many other strange comic adventures. George Clooney is good as the calm, conniving leader of the escapees, and his dirty sidekicks are hilarious. John Goodman has a notable appearance as a smooth-talking cyclops, and the man who plays the governor (whose name alas eludes me) is absoloutely superb in his role as corrupt politician. The film is visually beautiful, shot entirely through some kind of yellow filter that gives it a bleached appearance that feels very appropriate both to the American south of the period in which it is set, and to the ancient Greek world of Homer's Odyssey on which the story is based. The old-timey music that the convicts perform (at one point they become a singing trio called &quot;The Soggy Bottom Boys!&quot;) is appealing as well. You will enjoy watching this odd and unpredicatble effort, but I must say that it is not perfect. I have a problem with the way the Odyssey parallels are handled. Simply put, they don't make much sense in the modern setting unless you know that they are meant to be from the Odyssey. There is no subtlety in the parallels, so that basically what we are given is the Odyssey set in 1930s Missippi, for no apparent reason. I wish they could have done a better job of making events ring true in the modern setting - so that if you watched the movie and didn't know the Odyssey, it would all still make some kind of sense, however odd. But this is not the case, and I feel disappointed, in that they could have made it into a truly great movie this way instead of merely an interesting and good one. It works on some levels, but not on others.	4.0	Interesting...	2001-10-30	8	3	5

The reviews only show that the old adage, ""In matters of taste, there can be no argument"" is all too true. I loved this movie!! It has stayed with me for days and is a work of art, that all involved in making it, can be proud of.  Full of warmth, humor, compassion, intelligence, and wonderful music, it works on many levels to produce a beautiful film. I am amazed at all the subtle details that were put into the film, like little treasures, for the audience. The acting, across the board, is masterful, and all aspects of the film are presented with clarity and loving care.I'm not a blue grass or country and western music follower, but I loved the music in this film. I hope more movies of this quality are made, and that the director and cast are not put off by those who didnt tune into what they so beautifully did. Believe me, many did and said, ""Wow.""

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A267Y012F8WQDT	Kevin C.	As with all Coen brothers movies, it is off-beat and unlike anything else out there.  Those that don't appreciate the Coen's will say 'thank god', but for those of us who look forward to anything they come out with, it is worth seeing.  I'd put it a notch or two behind Fargo, but Clooney, Turturro and Blake are all great.  Clooney as the silver-tongued lawyer wasting his insights on his fellow escaped convicts with a combined IQ in the single digits.  It's not standard Hollywood fare, but it is entertaining, funny throughout and the music is enjoyable.	4.0	O' Brother--it's original and a hoot	2001-12-14	1	1	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A5YSAONJ07GAD	"Kevin Tumlinson ""Wordslinger"""	I was raised in the South, by grandparents who lived through the Depression and the Dust Bowl era. I was raised on Bluegrass music and a simple, conservative outlook on life. And in my later years I was exposed to world and classic literature, which sparked a love for both. This film hit all of those notes in me, and remains one of my all-time favorites.The Coen brothers have crafted a masterpiece with this work, and it remains one of George Clooney's best roles. The characters are lovably flawed, the landscape is character in itself, and the music ... dear Lord the music. It's like revisiting my childhood with better production value.	5.0	Nostalgia and Literary License &#8212; A perfect film	2014-03-28	0	0	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	AC2TK7NHKB5C0	"Kiki B. ""The Shepherdess"""	Oh, brother!!!  The only reason I was interested in & purchased this film was because I understood it spurred a revival of interest in bluegrass music.  How fully disappointed I am!  This film is offensive and pointless from the get-go, with profanity and misuse of the Name throughout.  The portrayal of the people of the Deep South during the Depression is of a vulgar, common folk who cannot think for themselves or formulate an idea of depth, full of hate and mistrust toward one another, with the protagonist being the lone thinker in the entire cast.  What a useless waste of time!  I fast-forwarded through much of it, seeking to at least find a song here or there to give the film credence.  Even that was disappointing, as only during the credits at the end were there a couple of songs that weren't interrupted by absurdity.  I feel terrible that I wasted ten dollars on it.  I initially thought that I'd sell it or give it away once it was over, as I knew I had NO further use of it; however, it is now packed away neatly in its case at the bottom of my trash bin.  Please invest your money and your time in something of value, not this garbage!	1.0	Save a Sawbuck - Disregard this Film!!!!!!!	2009-12-24	31	3	28

The colors were lush and warm, and completely appropriate to the story. But the story was slow and the characters frustrating. There was so little depth to any of the characters, that you didn't really care what happened to them next. This movie does showcase yet another facet of George Clooney's acting talents and if you're a George Clooney fan, you'll probably enjoy this one more because of it.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3K1LK6DJCVPUK	K. Palmer	Whenever I read a review of a movie written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, I invariably see the words &quot;original&quot; and &quot;quirky&quot; in the description of the film.  But after renting and watching &quot;Oh Brother, Where Art Thou&quot;, I am coming to the conclusion that &quot;original&quot; and &quot;quirky&quot; does not necessarily make a great film.I wanted to enjoy &quot;Oh Brother, Where Art Thou&quot; and I did think that the cinematography was excellent and the old-time songs were terrific, but this movie is harmed by too many long, drawn out scenes that do little to advance the plot.  I cite as examples the three convicts meeting the three women at the lake/river, the entire governor election subplot and the George &quot;Babyface&quot; Nelson sequence.  These scenes contain actors I enjoy watching (Charles Durning and Michael Badalucco from &quot;The Practice&quot;), but they do little to move the story along and I wondered if they were included just to make sure this movie was a reasonable length for a Coen movie (because without them, the movie would be about an hour long).I think that the three convicts (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) each have their moments, but there just isn't enough meat in the story to make their performances that interesting in general.  I will say that Clooney makes a great slimy character.The Coen brothers have become established enough that just about anything they do will garner praise from the critics.  In some movies, like &quot;Fargo&quot; and &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;, the praise is well-deserved, but in others, like &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; and &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot;, it isn't.  I have to put this movie with the latter category.  Better luck next time, Joel and Ethan.	2.0	It Should Be Called &quot;Oh, Brother, Where Art My 4 Bucks?&quot;	2001-06-13	13	3	10

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1D8FXMKOLTL7A	Lalalalaura	I have two problems with this movie.  The first is that I found it relatively boring.  The only parts where I felt really involved with the movie were when there was music playing, so you might as well just get the soundtrack (which I've done).  George Clooney was kind of nice to look at, but I didn't care about the characters.  What a waste of John Turturro!  Not to mention Holly Hunter.My second problem is more complicated.  As someone from New England who has grown to love the South, I was annoyed by the way accents seemed, in this movie, to be used to show the intelligence of the characters, with the smarter characters having less accent, the less smart ones more, and the downright stupid characters combining their thick thick accents with stuttering, gulping, and bugged-out, rolling eyes.  I should say that my friends in the South don't mind any of this, but that's probably because they don't live with this kind of charicature of the South on a daily basis as I do.  Maybe I'm being overly sensitive here, and maybe if I'd loved the movie otherwise I wouldn't have noticed it, but for me it cut too close to all the other times I've heard people use southern accents to indicate that someone is stupid, even if that person is actually from New England.	3.0	you'd do better to buy the soundtrack	2001-09-30	13	2	11

Still, as is The Hudsucker Proxy, this film is whimsically amusing and highly stylized, though it probably will not be everyone's cup of tea. Fans of the Coen Brothers, however, will think that they have died and gone to heaven, when they see this film.The film takes place in Mississippi, the heart of the deep south, during the depression. Ulysses Everett McGill, charmingly played by George Clooney, who displays some real comedic talent, is a dapper dan of a fellow. Working on a chain gang, he escapes along with two other felons, disarmingly played by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. They are on their way to hunt up some buried treasure, the proceeds of a robbery, which McGill claims to know about. It later turns out that this was a mere ruse on the part of McGill, as he really had a different agenda.During their episodic odyssey, they encounter a motley crew of characters who brighten the cinematic landscape. The film also resonates with the sounds of blue grass and down home country music. The cinematography is wonderful, as it conveys the dustbowl feeling of the depression era, rural countryside. All in all, it makes for a pretty terrific, though highly unusual, film. Funny and, at times, enigmatic, it is a film only the Coen Brothers could or would make.	4.0	THE COEN BROTHERS DO IT AGAIN...	2006-12-09	0	0	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A29M11KZGBXC4V	Lee	You don't necessarily need to enjoy bluegrass, but it sure don't hurt because some of the finest bluegrass in the world is probably heard in this video.  Norman Blake does a terrific rendition of &quot;You Are My Sunshine,&quot; and you'll find a real &quot;old timey&quot; sound coming from The Whites, The Cox Family, Allison Krauss, and other Newgrass artists.  The movie is charming, gutsy, and hugely entertaining.  George Clooney-- who happens to look remarkably like Clark Gable in this movie-- shows his talent for the comedic in his role as Ulysses Everett McGill, the smooth talker in the trio of escapees fleeing a chain gang in 1920s Mississippi.  Adventures, escapades, and political predicaments follow hot on their recently-freed heels, and all of it is accompanied with unforgettable music.  Buy the soundtrack if, for nothing else, the &quot;Soggy Bottom Boys'&quot; rendition of 'Man of Constant Sorrow.'  O Brother is a treasure.	5.0	A rare cinematic odyssey	2002-01-25	0	0	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	AYMZTWBG0V53W	"Leslie Karen Rigsbey ""Leslie Rigsbey"""	"Idiotic film about a motley crew of escaped convicts (lead by the shyster supreme Clooney) who attempt to locate a cache of riches that the Clooney character has buried for himself. He is anxious to get off the chain gang so that he can retrieve his wealth, but long before the script can get to what it's about, it takes some absurdly inconsistent detours, one in a hick music recording studio, one in a KKK meeting (this part is actually disturbing), and one in a vintage movie theater...but if you're still interested in seeking the treasure by this time, then you don't understand what the Coen Brothers are doing here. And, in point of fact, I'm not sure that I want to. Religious beliefs, backwoods dialects, race, gender, and even talent are all parodied in a VERY insulting fashion here, all without the graphic and demonic violence that the Coen Brothers are usually all too happy to include in their efforts at telling narrative stories on screen--something they obviously have yet to perfect, in any case.Most of these performances are very silly, and I have no idea as to why this film became as popular as it did. Some of the music is okay, but not of the kind of best-selling, ""oh my gosh you must hear it"" variety. It is an unusually framed and colored movie, but you have to have a pretty strong mind to handle the assault upon basic intelligence that this film proffers. Another pile of hand-me-down hogwash from the Coen Brothers, who actually manage to offend fans of Preston Sturges along the route of their cinematic destruction course. If you are interested in gaining wisdom instead of jumping upon the bandwagon, read the write-up by the accredited university professor near the back of Ronald Bergan's published biography of Joel and Ethan (in which the professor derides these guys because he explains that ""the message is that there is no message""--he can help you to understand why the Coen Brothers and their films are utterly pointless). It will tell you all that you need to know about these intellectually dishonest moviemakers, and will hopefully set viewers upon the proper path of rejecting movies such as this one.

It wasn't up to par and didn't get me running out to by a CD.  But don't stop here -- read on to obtain suggestions for CDs to include in your library.The characters are quirky and the somewhat forgettable, but I enjoyed it while it was on the screen.  There were some side-slappin' times and one of the few films that could bring this generation of movie-goers to visit the Great Depression.  For that reason alone, I give it three stars.I hope younger folks will turn to their parents or grandparents to learn about their own stories of this unforgettable time in our country's history.  Perhpas even the ""coolest"" of kids will secretly be tapping their toe to a sound that is much of white America's dreams and struggles.**** for the effort to show our humble years in the depression.  Hartford himself would have been a great character for this film, but I have since learned of his illness during its' inception.Don't just go away with a cute story in your mind though.  Check out ""Mark Twang"" or ""Steam Powered Areoplane"" by John Harford (once famous for the song ""Gentle on My Mind""); or pay the price for the three disc compilation called ""Will The Circle Be Unbroken.""

My first reaction to it was - `what the heck is this?' and then when I watched it again last night - for the fourth time - I found it very entertaining, strange, humorous and definitely mesmerizing in parts.It's got everything, weirdness, action, adventure, strangeness and lots of very difficult performances. George Clooney leads the ensemble with appearances by Charles Durning and John Goodman. The films tells the story of three convicts from the 30's escaping their prison sentence but with the problem of finding a large amount of money hundreds miles away. Two of the convicts are not so bright and George, although seemingly a person who is well read, is somewhat out of tune with reality.This film is definitely for the eclectic person who likes the unusual but entertaining strangeness that this movie is.

This guy is rightious, if it weren't for him I don't think that I could give this movie five stars! The rest of the charectors are great as well, but in my opinion, George Nelson is on the throwne of great charectors! everytime I watch this movie, I always look forward to the part where the cops are car chasing George Nelson and all of the sudden, George starts shooting the live stock and all this time the cops are a little distance away from Georges car and some cows walk between Georges car and the cop cars and the car in front rams into the cow and I swear the front of the car jumps two or three feet in the air and it just totals the car. Everytime I see that part, I swear I am going to kill my self because I am laughing so hard and I can hardly breathe, let me tell you why I think that part is holarious! because back in 1994 me and my dad were driving out in the backroads in his 1973 ford high boy, we had just barely got done restoring her so she still had some bugs in the engine that we had to work out and she died on us, so my dad's friend came and towed us back to the farm with his 93 ford truck and basically the same thing happened to us, we were a ways from the farm and we were being towed back and this damn cow got right between the two trucks and SLAM we hit that damn cow and literally ran over the damn thing and it hurt like a bitch when we hit the roof. That is why I find that part so funny, because I can't imagine how the cops in that first car felt, plus it brought back some old memories, not to mention the look on george nelsons face, something happened to the cow and the cops which he hates one almost as worse as the other. Another reason why I think it is so funny is because movies don't usually show that anymore and you aren't expecting it and then all of the sudden the car jumps three feet in the air and the cow is laying in front of the car as mangled as the car is. It is kind of sad when you think of the situation and probably to most people that scene is really uncool but if you have ever had that experience, I can promise you that you will laugh your ass off! all in all this movie is totally kick ass, so get home early one night,sit down with your family, get the bowl of popcorn, and grab that bottle of beer and sit back and enjoy the ride	5.0	I'M GEORGE NELSON, BORN TO RAISE HELL	2004-10-22	13	8	5

I even enjoyed the Blue Grass sound track, although I'm more of a pop, classical, and jazz kind of guy. But the music was great, too, and it really added to the overall ambience of the movie.Some of the scenes are just classic, such as the Baby Face Nelson gettaway with the cows, the KKK ""dance of the sugar plum fairies,"" (as I call it), the scene with the ""river sirens,"" and the scene at the concert where the Soggy Bottom Boys finally sing their hit song to the entralled crowd, which the guys can't figure out.I recognized the actor who played George Nelson from The Practice TV show but hadn't seen any of his other work before, and I thought his over-the-top portrayal was really amazing considering he plays a stolid, respectable lawyer and  very different character in the TV show.I was also amazed at how well George Clooney pulled off the dancing and high-stepping at the concert and political rally. He proved himself to be a pretty competent hoofer in the great tradition of hoofer actors (like Bob Hope, James Cagney, and Gregory Hines, etc., although of a different style).So overall, another very funny, wacky movie from the Cohn bros. that certainly won't disappoint the fans, and with a classic Blue Grass sound track that really fit the movie well."	5.0	A few comments	2004-02-29	5	3	2

The acting is great - over the top, and the cast of characters are somehow the perfect mix.  Seems like each time I watch this, I see something new. George Clooney is just perfect in the Ulysses role, with John Turturro and Tim Black Nelson as his stumbling and earnest sidekicks.  John Goodman is the cyclops, and Holly Hunter is a delight.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	ATLZ3GS1UMK2Y	Mandamus	"It is unfortunate that a film that received such widespread acclaim and boasts being based on Homer's Odyssey could let its viewer down with such a hollow piece of work. The synthesis of Depression-era Mississippi and Homeric Greece falls flat on its face; instead of intelligently incorporating the Odyssey's themes, the film blatantly steals scenes to no apparent effect. The siren scene, for example, is of no consequence to the film; our hereos get sucked in by their song and then....nothing. The scene with John Goodman, who turns in yet another memorable albeit brief role as the ""cyclops,"" also has no significance to the ""plot."" Rather it seems that the Coen brothers stole the form of the Odyssey but left the content behind, apparently for no other reason than to get people to see this vacuous movie.Speaking of getting people into the seats....George Clooney was hopelessly unconvincing as a smooth talking backwoodsman with pommaded hair. The film is full of largely unknown actors, most of whom do impressive jobs, and their anonymity adds to the believability of the movie. Yet Clooney stands out like a sore thumb in the dusty, gritty setting. His character is not even that likeable. For example, his whole reason for escaping was to reunite with his wife, with whom he has about as much spark as a jar of mayonnaise.A few redeeming qualities: the music is quite good, and Clooney's sidekicks give very good performances. But throughout the film, I was waiting for it to inspire me, to move me--hell, just make me laugh. It did none of this. Like the average American tourist in Europe, the Coen brothers did nothing more than walk through the motions of the Odyssey, stopping every now and then to take photographs of their ignorant, smug faces in front of a majesterial backdrop they fail to comprehend."	2.0	Disappointing	2002-03-06	14	4	10

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1IANEBSMVGHS9	"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny"""	Ever since I noticed the hype around this movie and its soundtrack I confess I had been a bit skeptical about watching it: I'm not a fan of bluegrass music or movies that take place in the beginning of the 20th century, but the Cohen Brothers most recent masterpiece (they have The Big Lebowski and Fargo among others, in their background) proved me wrong.The whole theme for the movie can be based off Homer's &quot;Oddisey&quot; or even &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; as one reviewer conmmented before. But the real key to the heart of this movie is the goof nature of the characters: just as Joel Cohen says in the production featurette included in the DVD, the funny trio are like the &quot;Three Stooges.&quot;This has been one clever movie all through which I was able to laugh very hard, and the funniest thing about it is that it's not a comedy at all. More like the struggles of this runaway trio you sympathize with from the very start, to find some treasure that Ulysees Everett McGill (played by Clooney) buried before going to prison. Through their adventures they face the sirens call, they oppose the cyclops (Big Dan Teague, played by John Goodman) and hit local musical stardom not knowing about it with the song &quot;Man of constant sorrow.&quot;The acting is very solid: Clooney, Turturro and Nelson all play great roles. The cinematography, by Roger Deakins (long time film companion of the Cohen brothers), is even more outstanding: it is the first time the entire post-production of a film is done digitally. The process used for doing this is explained in extensive detail in a very interesting featurette included in the DVD.Overall, deserving all the credit and the hype around it: it's an authentice masterpiece overall. Thanks to the Joel and Ethan Cohen for such good film making.	5.0	THREE STOOGES RESURRECTED!!	2001-09-09	4	1	3

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	AH86MZPURQLCR	Marc Harris	I was amazed the good reviews this movie received, because I found it embarrassingly cheesey and contrived. Maybe that was supposed to be part of the charm, who knows...The movie felt like in a lot of scenes, they were trying to be quirky and offbeat just for the sake of being quirky and offbeat, and it just ended up not being very entertaining for me. George Clooney felt like he was acting...only the always excellent John Turturro was believable for me. The music was effective and really crucial to setting the mood of each scene.  ..in fact, that may have been the most entertaining part of the whole movie. I think I chuckled maybe once or twice thruout the whole movie and really lost interest in it part way through.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A36YCH7L60U7L1	Margaret E. Dillard	I saw the original &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou? in the theatres three times and simply loved it. It was probably my all-time favorite movie --that is, until I bought my own copy and saw how money-hungry, consensus-building editors had ruined this masterpiece. I am a big bluegrass and blues fan and really loved the varied music, and in the original, caught a glipse of the South of my grandparents' time in the picturesque scenery and hilarious spoofs on the bigotry that was an unfortunate reality of the day. The portions that were cut out of the theatre version were the very &quot;glue&quot; that held the story together from beginning to end and what made the corallary with &quot;The Odessey&quot; credible. Worst of all perhaps was the omission of critical scenes that not only destroyed the plot and developed the characters, but defamed the music as well, especially Allison Crouse's solo and subsequent choral crescendo leading up to the baptismal scene. What a sad, sad hack job. It makes me want to weep. And what I wouldn't give for a copy of the unadulterated, unbutchered version!	2.0	O Brother - Where Art The REAL Thing?	2002-01-15	8	4	4

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A110GNXU0AL7LR	MARK A BOWDEN	When I first saw this movie, I didn't understand it and thought it was stupid.  My problem was that I didn't understand anything about Homer's Odyssey.  I didn't realize that this was supposed to be rather silly.So after a short time passed, I thought I would give it another try.  I thoroughly enjoyed it the second time through.  Some of the music is a bit slow for my tastes, but a lot of it is just great, down-home bluegrass.  The movie can drag on a bit as well.  (That's why I gave it only 4 stars).The characters in this movie really are characters in a different sense.  Clooney, Turturro and Nelson do a wonderful job in this movie, and seem to portray people of this era well.I think that if you know ahead of time that this movie is supposed to have some silliness in it (okay, a lot of silliness), you will enjoy it as I did.	4.0	I Had to Watch This One Twice to Appreciate It	2002-03-01	2	2	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A129YBX5BVNW2	"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry"""	"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2011 ALL-REGIONS BLU RAY REISSUE ***""Hot Damn! It's The Soggy Bottom Boys!""When the Coen Brothers unleashed ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" into cinemas in September 2000 - it was an audio and visual sensation. The DVD that followed in 2001 received equal praise. But little will prepare fans for this truly beautiful 2011 BLU RAY transfer - it's properly gorgeous to look at - and up there with the best this (often frustrating) format can offer...When it was originally filmed on location - a 'lossless' digital process was used to fully realise the specific light and scenery of Depression-hit Mississippi in 1937 (beautiful gold and yellow hues). That process combined with the stunning cinematography of Roger Deakins both get to shine like never before. There are times when the visuals are quite literally breathtaking in their clarity. And the canvas to impress your eyes just keeps coming at you as the movie progresses from location to location - open fields, hay barns, twisted swamps, dust roads, river banks, inside period cars and beat-up trucks, the chain-gang detail, radio stations and bank interiors. Even in the notoriously difficult indoor scenes in ramshackle homesteads and around campfires at night - it all looks 'so' good. Add to this a blisteringly funny script full of savvy life-observations and brutal local colloquialisms - and it's hardly surprising that it was nominated for 2 Academy Awards in these areas (Best Script and Cinematography).Defaulted to 2.35:1 aspect ratio - it has bars top and bottom of the screen - but even when stretched to full screen - it rarely loses any definition. And better news for fans around the world is that this issue is an 'ABC/All Regions' BLU RAY - so it will play on every machine (as well as PlayStation 3 consoles).Written and Directed by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen - ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" comes across as a sort of Three Stooges Road Movie with song accompaniment. Roughly based on Homer's Greek tragedy ""The Iliad"" about a journey of salvation with many ""ob-stack-les"" along the weary way - its genius soundtrack also sparked a worldwide interest in Blues, Gospel and Old Timey Country music - much of which had been long forgotten and often derided as hick and corny (2011 saw a 2CD 'Deluxe Edition' reissue of this). The film was immediately followed by the DVD release of the ""Down From The Mountain"" concert in Nashville, Tennessee featuring live music played by musicians on the Grammy-winning soundtrack. Anyone who has seen it will know that it's an equally joyful and musically charged experience. This is America before the sadness and loss of 9/11 - enjoying itself and celebrating its heritage - and rightly so.The large and varied cast is exceptional - especially the grotesque caricatures that pepper scene after scene. Quinn Gasaway as a gun-totting boy in filthy overalls, Stephen Root as the bug-eyed giggling recording studio boss, John Goodman as the dodgy Bible salesman Big Dan Teague whose ears pop up when he hears the crisp click of dollar bills in a restaurant. His eye-patch signals him as the club-wielding one-eyed Cyclops. Wayne Duvall as the hood-wearing racist Homer Stokes trying to get elected over Charles Durning - the portly but wily Governor of Mississippi - Pappy ""Pass The Biscuits"" O'Daniel who also hosts a radio show. So many great parts...The story goes something like this - chained together as a trio of escaped convicts - they are driven to find a $1.2 million dollar treasure Everett is supposed to have hidden in a shack in a valley that is to be flooded in five days time to build a massive hydro-electric dam. But they are being pursued by the Devil in sunglasses with his mean dog - Sheriff Cooley (played with relish by Daniel Von Bargen). After visiting a relative of Pete's called Wash (a man who rarely does) - the boys are hounded off the farm yet again. They then meet a Negro called Tommy Johnson at a crossroads and give him a lift (superbly played by Louisiana guitarist Chris Thomas King). He explains that at midnight the night before he sold his immortal soul to the Devil in return for a guitar that he ""sure can play"" (like the folklore surrounding Blues legend Robert Johnson). Delmar is appalled but Everett sees a business opportunity. If they can get to a radio station on the outskirts of the State - there's a man there who'll give them money to ""sing into a can"". They eventually get there - pretend to be The Soggy Bottom Boys - do a charged rendition of ""I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow"" - and cut a record. But unbeknown to the hapless crew - a radio hit is born that will literally save their souls (and lives) in the end. But before they can get to that redemption of sorts - all sorts of journey hilarity ensues - including a reunion between Everett and his estranged wife Penny (Holly Hunter) and their 4-strong progeny of mouthy daughters. There are gun-battles with a madcap bank robber George 'Baby Face' Nelson who shoots livestock because he hates cows (a fantastic turn by Coens' favourite Michael Badalucco) and sexy Sirens by the river who turn Pete into a horny toad. It all ends with tins of Dapper Dan pomade floating by the screen when the big flood comes (along with everything else)...The music deserves a special mention. While audiences expected to howl with laughter and cringe at the array of unhygienic ingrates displayed on screen - what they hadn't expected was to be so moved by the old-timey music - full of ballads about heartbreak, poverty and death. A perfect example is The Cox Family singing ""I Am Weary (Give Me Rest)"" on a truck at a town gathering - the melody and lyrics are genuinely moving. The congregation making their way through the trees to the river to be baptised as they sing (Acapella) ""Down To The River To Pray"". Country and Blues musicians also have on-and-off-camera cameos - Clooney lip-synching in the recording booth is really being sung by Dan Tyminski of Alison Krauss' band Union Station - Gillian Welch asking for a copy of the song in a record shop - Alison Krauss, Gillian Welch and Emmylou Harris provide the Acapella vocals as the seductive Sirens on the river - Ralph Stanley of The Stanley Brothers singing ""O Death"" as Tommy is led by a lynch mob to a gallows and a burning cross - The Fairfield Four Gospel group singing as they dig graves by a log cabin...But the movie belongs to the three principal leads - John Turturro as the permanently moaning Pete Hogwallop and Tim Blake Nelson as the less than Mensa-material Delmar O'Donnell (a role he would revive to great effect in ""Flypaper"" - see review). There is a rare and completely believable chemistry between them. But the big revelation here is George Clooney playing the philosophy-jabbering Everett Ulysses McGill. While he doesn't quite reach the cult-inducing peaks of Jeff Bridges as 'The Dude' in the Coens incomparable ""The Big Lebowski"" (a part emblazoned into cinema lover's hearts forever) - Clooney shows a deftness of touch for comedy and pathos throughout that is quite fantastic. More importantly he seemed to finally park his devastatingly handsome good looks by taking a career chance and showing the world that he was more than just a pretty face. Clooney can act his soggy pants off if given the right part (something he's proved many times since).The only real let down is the paltry extras (those that accompanied the initial DVD issue) which last only a few minutes and leave you craving more.Still - this is a fantastic advertisement for what BLU RAY can offer. I only wish I had a humungous home-cinema system to watch it on.To sum up - after they fail to catch a passing train full of men with ""aimless lives of wandering..."" Delmar is asked by the other two squabblers to give the deciding vote on who is leader of the trio. Delmar sappily says - ""I'm with you fellas!""I wholeheartedly agree.BLU RAY Specifications:VIDEO: 1080p High Definition - Aspect Radio 2.35:1AUDIO: English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and Spanish 2.0 Dolby DigitalSUBTITLES: English SDH (Hard Of Hearing), French and SpanishEXTRAS:1.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3QIEISBZP4QTV	"Mark E. Baxter ""Inquirer"""	I don't know if you get as tired as I do looking for a good, intelligent movie, but I get tired of Jim Carey making strange faces and depressing losers on a crime,sex,or drug spree.  I had no idea what to expect when I saw this movie while waiting to meet someone at a mall, but I was entranced.  I found it touching, funny, and thought-provoking all at the same time.The only drawback was that sometimes the dialogue was unintelligible - kind of the aural equivalent of all of those scenes where it's so dark that you can't see what is happening. Now I realize that making the movie-goer uncomfortable and sit forward in his seat may have a role in a suspense movie, but there is no role for this kind of manipulation in a movie that is supposed to be entertaining.Nevertheless, I bought this movie the first day it was out - I even pre-ordered it.  I usually don't buy movies, nor do I watch them more then once.  I've enjoyed it immensely and the music is incredible.	4.0	Best movie of the year (and I even bought the soundtrack)	2001-11-21	1	0	1
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A36EW68H08UOCS	"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!"""	Joel and Ethan Coen seem incapable of making a film that isn't at least interesting, and often their movies are absolutely delightful.  I think everyone has their favorites (mine are &quot;Fargo&quot; and &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;), but this film touched a few cultural nerves that are infrequently accessed.For one thing, the soundtrack features a brilliant collection of grass-roots and Americana music - acoustic blues and jazz and bluegrass.  Alison Krauss, already a novelty around Nashville as a platinum-selling bluegrass artist, received a thunderbolt of a boost to her career by supplying several tunes and vocal parts to the soundtrack (for example singing the Heavenly &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot; during the baptism scene and the seductive voice of one of the sirens later on).  Dan Tyminski, one of the musicians from Alison's band, Union Station, supplies the singing voice of George Clooney and Dan Tyminski's &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; became even MORE of a novelty around Nashville as it won one Country Music Award after another without the benefit of any significant radio play.The script is VERY loosely based on Homer's Odyssey and knowing that allows the moderately educated a few hearty chuckles recognizing, for example, that John Goodman's Eye-Patched Bible Salesman represents the Cyclops.George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson deliver the Coen's rib-tickling dialogue with gusto.  I don't know why it's so entertaining to watch characters who are clueless, or at least more clueless than they think they are, but to see three bravura performances as chain-gang refugee dunces is a treat here.In a typical early sequence our trio has just made their break from the chain-gang and Clooney's Everett begins taking charge.  Turturro's Pete questions him:&quot;Wait a minute.  Who elected you leader of this outfit?&quot;Everette responds &quot;Well, Pete, I figured it should be the one with the capacity for abstract thought.  But if that ain't the consensus, then hell, let's put it to a vote.&quot;&quot;Suits me&quot;, says Pete. &quot;I'm voting for yours truly.&quot;&quot;Well, I'm voting for yours truly too&quot; replies Everett, not backing down.Pete and Everett turn to their slightly denser partner Delmar to break the deadlocked vote.He ponders it thoughtfully.&quot;Okay.... I'm with you fellers&quot;.Classic Coen Brothers.----------------------------One tidbit provided on the &quot;Alison Krauss and Union Station LIVE DVD&quot;: Dan Tyminski, upon learning that he was going to be providing the singing voice for George Clooney, called his wife to give her the exciting news.&quot;Honey! They're making a movie and I'm doing a voiceover for George Clooney!&quot;&quot;Oh, that's good, Dan.  What's a voiceover?&quot;&quot;Well, when people go to see the movie and look up on the screen, they'll see George Clooney, but when he sings it'll be my voice coming out of his mouth!&quot;&quot;Oh Dan&quot;, Mrs. Tyminski replied. &quot;That's my fantasy!&quot;	5.0	O Brother, It's Good	2004-06-09	6	6	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1HFIKNWLABJIN	"mark ""weeping_guitar"""	"O Brother where art thou comes courtesy of Joel and Ethan Coen who do nothing to break their reputation of making quirky and ultra-stylish films that end up magnificent. Following their tales of the upper Midwest (Fargo) and a bowler from LA (The Big Lebowski) comes a take on Homer's Odyssey in the dirty 30s. George Clooney stars as our traveling hero Ulysses Everett McGill a man obsessed with his image and his special hair treatment.McGill convinces his jail buddies Pete (John Turturro) and Delmer (Tim Black Nelson) to escape alongside him with promise of a million dollar treasure awaiting them at the end of the trip. The trip really is all about him trying to re-unite with his wife in time before she gets remarried. Right away they run into a prophetic blind man on a railroad cart who warns them of their fate and then the standard Coen craziness begins.Among the things our trio of runaways encounters are one-eyed bulky bible salesman, 3 sirens who seduce them, the Klan, and a manic depressive bank robber amongst other things. Joining them off and on through their journey is Tommy, a black man who tells them he sold his soul to the devil so he could play the guitar, which does come in handy when the pop into a recording studio and make some easy money singing what becomes a smash hit for the movie world and in reality with ""Man of Constant Sorrow"".I will admit to having to see this film 3 or 4 times before it really clicked with me, but Coen fans in the end will absolutely adore this picture. The film is highlighted by solid acting performances and some great cinematography and the roots soundtrack, which brought as much attention to the picture as anything. So another solid fare from the Coens would have firmly rooted themselves as consistent filmmakers who can still make original films when they're most needed."	4.0	Another Fabulously Crazy Coen Comedy	2001-10-28	0	0	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	Joel and Ethan Cohen, two brothers from the Midwest, have been making quirky, flamboyant movies for two decades. They have created some delightful films, including Blood Simple, Raising Arizona and Fargo. O Brother, Where Art Thou? isn't one of their best efforts. It has some great scenes and superb acting, but the whole thing never quite adds up to a satisfactory whole. Still, even a minor Cohen movie ranks above the Hollywood average.The movie is based loosely - very loosely! - on Homer's epic Greek poem, The Odyssey. It takes place in the Mississippi Delta during the Great Depression of the 1930s. When it opens, Ulysses, Pete and Delmar [George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson] are escaping from a chain gang, and they spend most of the rest of the movie running from the law. Ulysses talks the other into escaping by claiming he buried the loot from a big robbery. They have to get to it quickly, he says, because the place where he buried it is about to be flooded for the creation of a lake. Their madcap adventures cause them to meet many strange, eccentric characters. There is the blind man who endlessly rides the rails and foretells the futures of those he meets. They meet the Bible salesman from hell, enthusiastically played by John Goodman, as well as three sirens who set out to seduce and rob them, a black blues musician who has just sold his soul the Devil at the crossroads, and Ulysses' wacky wife and daughters. They find some interesting discoveries, as well as some ugly surprises.As is typical of a Cohen brothers film, this one is fast-paced and rarely gives the audience time to think about what it has just seen. The movie is more a series of vignettes than it is a well structured story. Scenes that work are both hilarious and impressive, but the problem is that others fall flat. Also, the ending is uninspired, as if the team were unable to come up with a suitable punch line to their tale.Most of the actors here have worked with the Cohens before, which allows them to be quite comfortable in their roles. Tim Blake Nelson, as dimwitted Delmar, and Holly Hunter, as Ulysses' wife, are standout. This is George Clooney's first picture with this group, but he has no trouble fitting in. He is very good and very funny. In fact, in the last five years he has become one of my favorite actors.	3.0	Playful Coen brothers romp is a bit uneven	2002-03-15	1	0	1

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2BAUJLJCEYBYB	"Matthew MacDonald ""mattymacd"""	I just watched this film and can say that I enjoyed it upon first viewing. It left me entertained and was very inventive and original, like most Coen brothers films. However, a rental might be the ideal way to go before buying to get a taste of the film or else it may leave a little to be desired. Those expecting &quot;Fargo 2&quot; just because this is by the Coens should go elsewhere.Purportedly based on The Odyssey, the film can be enjoyed without any prior knowledge of that book. There are plenty of moments where the film left me confused, but you tend to overlook these things in a film like this. It can be enjoyed on two levels: as a story about 3 chain-gang escapees and there adventures, or as that coupled with the symbolic references to The Odyssey. Though some of the references aren't too difficult to associate with some basic knowledge of that work (the sirens, the cyclops), it would be pretty neat to have read the book and deduce the references to it.The actors give good performances, although the characters are somewhat overshadowe by the humorous southern accents and odd situations they're put in. My main problems with the film is its characters as they don't seem to have much depth, especially John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson's characters. The main characters seem only to serve as mechanisms to further the plot by getting into sticky situations and then getting out of them again. Not a problem in a comedy, but I don't know if you can say this film fits completely under the comedy genre.The DVD is pretty well done. The Painting with Pixels extra discusses how the filmmakers achieved the film's dry, burnt coloration and it's pretty cool; the look of the film is fabulous and really takes you to the Depression-era.  Also, the multi-angle feature comparing the film to its storyboards is well done (although your standard storyboard comparison), and the music video &quot;I'm a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; is a good addition as well.I only gave this film 3 stars because I can't justify giving it a better rating (maybe 3 1/2). It is enjoyable in an old-fashioned slapstick adventure way, and if you're a Coen brothers fan, this will probably be up your alley.  However, his film may be lost on a lot of people. Even if you're a fan of the Coens, it might be to your distaste. It's not a bad film, but if you often find yourself going &quot;What? What happened just then?&quot; a lot during a movie, you might want to skip this one.	3.0	An acquired taste...	2001-09-29	5	3	2

And if you took the risk on this movie, well all i have to say is sorry because it doesn't have any dialogue nor nutin.  But what makes you hate the movie the most is just that it isnt funny at all.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A257K87KQ1IP28	"M. Buisman ""Martijn Buisman"""	The Coen brothers have done it again. After Fargo they made another brilliant and different movie.It's an adaptation of Homer's Oddysey and there are numerous references to that ancient story.Ulysses (*) Mcgill gets out of prison with two men who are next to him on the chain gang. They call themselves adventurers and it really is an adventure through the state of Mississippi. They meet sirens, a cyclops and a blind radioshow host (Homer).Besides the ancient myths there are also some southern myths, like when they pick up Tom Johnson at the crossroads after he had just sold his soul to Satan to play guitar. A myth that later Robert Johnson took over and made it his own.Talking about music, never has one movie done a type of music so much good. Bluegrass, country, gospel, beautiful music in the entire music. Getting the soundtrack is almost worth as much as the movie. Another thing that is soothing to the ear are the great dialogues spoken by George Clooney.Soothing to the eye are the beautiful colors used. It was one of the first movies to digitally enhance some landscapes and because of that the colorsetting of the movie is now yellow, with some white and green and everything in between.A real treat for the senses, including the mind.	5.0	Wonderful movie steeped in mythology	2005-12-24	3	3	0

Our other choice was Shaft, which we all wanted to see, Burke insisted we watch O Brother Where Art Thou.We were all pleasantly surprised...although amazed might be a better word.  This movie, which roughly follows the Odysey (John Goodman as the Cyclops, the sirens and a possible Circe reference involving a frog are the only obvious parts) which is interesting.  Much better however is the wonderful camraderie between the various leads, especially George Clooney's fast quipped lines &quot;I'm they're pater familias&quot;You never know for sure which way this movie is going it meanders like a walk on a warm summer day and that is a wonderful, wonderful thing.

Clooney is a natural ham when lypsynching, you would swear he was singing. And even if you don't like folk/bluegrass music, you will love it when the film is over. &quot;Man of constant sorrow&quot; is a wonderful song, and if you are around 50 you will recognize it from the sixties when it was done at a slower tempo by folk artists. Scenery is breathtaking in the film. John Tuturro is a hoot and so is Tim Blake-Nelson. What a voice he's got. I always love Holly Hunter in everything and John Goodman is perfect as the conman/bible salesman. I want to watch it over and over to see what I missed the first time.

I also bought the CD, the first country or folk recording I have ever bought in my life, so that I could listen to the music in my car.Every Coen brothers movie is a marvel, but this one is just a gem.  It's hard to say what is so special about it.  The music -- American folk that has nothing in common with the electric &quot;country&quot; on the radio today -- is certainly unusual, and beautiful, and powerful.  The acting is wonderful.  The Coen brothers seem to get wonderful facial expressions out of everybody (the recording studio, Turturro boiling into anger), and I never realized George Clooney was such a wonderful actor.  The story has the zigzagging, zany quality that we have come to expect from the Coen brothers, laid over the Odyssey, and a sly humor that gets funnier every time you see the movie (&quot;we thought you was a toad!&quot;).

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	Another bizarre entry in the Coen Brothers arsenal, O BROTHER is a thoroughly entertaining if somewhat unusual film.  The story focuses on three prison escapees who are going to Mississippi to collect the 1.2 million dollars supposedly hidden there.  Based on Homer's ODYSSEY, the film involves our three heroes/stooges in some unusual adventures, all leading to a lot of twists in its looney conclusion.  What makes it work is the spirited performances of George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as the escapees; the charming bluegrass music including the surprise smash hit I AM A MAN OF CONSTANT SORROW and some nice bits from supporting players John Goodman and Holly Hunter.  It has some Three Stooges touches, and is filmed quite beautifully.  All in all, a weird but enjoyable comedy.	4.0	MEN OF CONSTANT SORROW	2006-10-11	0	0	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2ZLROGIL2V7GV	Michael Crane	I have to admit, I love movies by the Coen Brothers.  They're responsible for great movies like &quot;Fargo&quot;, &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;, and &quot;Big Lebowski&quot;.  I just watched this movie a couple of days ago, and well...  It was interesting.Don't get me wrong, I thought this was a pretty clever comedy for the most part.  Clooney and two other prisoners have escaped and are looking for buried treasure.  Along the way, they run into some very interesting characters and unpredictable situations at every corner.  This movie is based on &quot;Oddesy&quot; by Homer, except it all takes place in a different time.  A good example is John Goodman who plays a one-eyed Bible salesman, who of course resembles the Cyclops.  (Even though he was only in the movie for a small portion, I thought he had one of the best parts.)  George Clooney also does a superb job, and in fact, we even get to hear him sing.This was a clever comedy, but I felt that some parts were a little slow and hard to understand.  Some parts were more confusing than funny.  It's just not your typical Coen film, and maybe I expected a little more.Maybe this is one of those movies you have to see a second time to fully appreciate it for what it stands for.  There is some outstanding acting and twists along the way, and there are plenty of laughs for everyone to enjoy.  You may want to get familar with some of the &quot;Oddesy&quot; before you see this movie.  My advice, rent it first before buying it.  It's an odd comedy that isn't for everyone.  There's more intelligent humor than toilet humor in this movie.All in all, I thought &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; was a good movie, but I still think that &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is by far the best Coen movie out there.	3.0	DIFFERENT, BUT FUNNY	2001-07-12	4	2	2

In order to regain his family, Ulysses must battle both the human monsters of the modern world and the monsters contained in nature still exist between floods and intense rains. Throughout the journey home, the escaped group of convicts encounter obstacles that nod toward the historical roots of The Odyssey from the previously mentioned Cyclopes to the Sirens...a group of very attractive women who hypnotize one of the prisoners leaving him without clothes.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3QZCA4LTTVGAD	Michael J. Mazza	&quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou,&quot; directed by Joel Coen, is a quirky delight. The screenplay, by Joel and Ethan Coen, is allegedly a loose adaptation of Homer's Odyssey; I think of the script as more of an original story with certain elements inspired by the Odyssey. But however you look at the film, it is a unique and well-made piece of cinematic art.George Clooney plays Ulysses Everett McGill, an escaped prisoner who embarks upon an episodic journey with two fellow escapees in the Depression-era Southern United States. Along the way they encounter a one-eyed Bible salesman, &quot;good-ole-boy&quot; politicians, and Ku Klux Klansmen, among other characters. Clooney is hilarious as McGill, and the rest of the cast is also excellent. Tim Blake Nelson is particularly engaging as McGill's Forrest Gump-ish comrade, Delmar.The film is full of excellent music that evokes the folk traditions of the rural U.S. The costumes, sets, and cinematography are all first-rate, and blend perfectly with the other elements of the film. There are some great comic sequences, many with a satiric bite. Overall, &quot;O Brother&quot; is a really different, richly entertaining film.	5.0	A comic journey filled with great music	2001-06-09	16	14	2

Starring George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro,  it features a brilliantly written script, superb acting by a wonderful ensemble cast, and a musical score that's simply second to none.&quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; is a simple story really... set in the Mississippi delta region during the Great Depression, it's the tale of three petty criminals who escape from the chain gang in quest of buried treasure and experience a series of misadventures along the way.  Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney) is the silver-tongued, self-appointed leader of this odd trio, a man who claims to have stolen and buried over a million dollars in cash.  Delmar O'Donnell is the docile, sweet-tempered dimwit (played to perfection by Tim Blake Nelson).  The third member of our little gang is an irritable, acerbic fella named  Pete.  Together they set off, chained to each other, in search of McGill's treasure, which is buried somewhere about to become a man-made lake.  Our heroes have only four days to find the loot before it's lost forever at the bottom of the newly created reservoir.As they begin their journey, the run across an old blind seer who prophesies that they  will find a fortune, but not the one they seek. with a posse of law enforcement officers and vigilantes hot on their heels, Everett, Pete and Delmar ditch their chains and prison garb and continue on their quest.Our trio's journey is anything but quiet and uneventful.  They continually run into strange people and situations... At one point, soon after stealing a car and picking up a guitar-playing hitch-hiker, they stop at a local radio station and, posing as an &quot;old-timey&quot; music group called the &quot;Soggy Bottom Boys,&quot; they cut a record that's soon all the rage throughout the region.  Later they encounter a Baptist congregation at river's edge, singing a beautiful song, lulling our heroes into sweet forgetfulness for a few brief moments.  They happen upon three washer-women, also at river's edge, whose siren-like song ensnares our three miscreants... George Nelson, a bank robber on the run, who nearly co-opts our heroes into a REAL life of crime...  the one-eyed, fast-talking Bible salesman Dan Teague (played by John Goodman) who offers Everett, Pete, and Delmar a hard lesson on economics and life in general in the Depression-ravaged Deep South...  and other characters as well:  Governor  Pappy &quot;Pass the Biscuits&quot; O'Daniel, running for re-election against a reform-minded candidate named Homer Stokes... Everett's ex-wife Penny, soon to me re-married to a real drone named Vernon Waldrip... and a whole gang of fellas dressed in white sheets and hoods who take exception to our heroes' intrusion into their ceremonies.One of &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou's?&quot; greatest strengths is its musical score.  As the Coen brothers point out, nary a scene goes by without some kind of music in the background.  The songs - 19 of them by my count - are  all wonderful.  It's a sublime mixture of old-time gospel and country music and African-American spirituals.  From James Carter and the Prisoners' &quot;Po' Lazarus,&quot; through Alison Krause's sweetly  simple and reverent &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot; (with brilliant harmonies added by the First Baptist Choir of White House, Tennessee);  the old-time country classics &quot;I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Hard Rock Candy Mountain,&quot; and &quot;You Are My Sunshine;&quot; to the old-time Gospel classics &quot;Keep On the Sunny Side;&quot; &quot;I'll Fly Away&quot; and &quot;I Am Weary (Let Me Rest),&quot; (and many other songs as well), the music adds an extra dimension to this already multi-faceted film.  (By the way, all these songs can be found on the &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; soundtrack compact disc... but that's another review!)I've now watched &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; about  a dozen times.  Each viewing has been a genuine pleasure for me. This film is clever in its conception, extraordinary in its execution, sublime in its storytelling, and masterful in its music.  In short... wonderfully entertaining in every respect.  A definite &quot;must-see&quot; for movie-lovers everywhere!	5.0	Homer meets The Three Stooges in the Mississippi Delta!	2002-03-16	16	14	2
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A27PSZX2SE0B51	Mike Stone	"""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" does a fine job building up a reservoir of good faith.  From the first shot of Our Heroes emerging from the wheat field, to Clooney's curious predilection for a certain brand of pomade, to the lovably sweet mug of Tim Blake Nelson, you just know that a rocking good time is going to be had by all.  That's what I mean by good faith.  And it's a good thing it works so hard at building it up, because it nearly runs out of it in the end.  Luckily, the closing credits pop up just in time.Not being expertly familiar with ""The Odyssey"" (my English degree hides its eyes in shame), I only got the most obvious of the movie's Ulyssean references (e.g., Clooney's name; an eyepatched John Goodman as the Cyclops; the Sirens).  Don't think it mattered much, though.  It does help if you look at the story as something mythic rather than something realistic.  Suspend that disbelief, and you shall reap entertainment.The Coen's pay a lot of attention to making the land being traversed optimal for this particular quest.  The terrain flows from arid squalor to lush greenery, from the isolatedly rural to the hecticly urban, and the cinematography is apropos in each setting.  It's also quite gorgeous.  It's not as cartoonish as, say, ""Raising Arizona"", but the Coen's sure know how to frame a comedic shot and sequence.George Clooney, as the loquacious leader, is miles away from anything else he's done.  I've heard it time and time again that he is a one-note actor, given to hanging his head in a grating, sheepdoggish manner (I call this the `Doug Ross Tilt'), hoping for your forgiveness but not really sorry.  Well, he does none of that here.  Instead, he bugs out his eyes, messes up his hair, and screams like a little girl.  It's a great comedic performance.  He's ably backed up by Coen regular John Turturro, who appears to be a ragged collection of arms and legs and teeth, and Tim Blake Nelson.  I was surprised to learn that Nelson is also a playwright, screenwriter, and director.  Surprised because his Delmar is ""dumber than a bag of hammers"", but blessed with so much pure folksy wisdom that you just fall in love with him.  There are some moments when he is caught with just the most blissful look on his face.  They say more than any dialogue ever could.  Bless the Coen's heart for letting them do just that.  Also on hand here filling out the minor roles are Coen veterans John Goodman (a big and blustery bible salesman) and Holly Hunter (as Clooney's [ex-]wife), as well as prodigious scenery chewer Charles Durning (as the incumbent governor of Mississippi) and the underrated Stephen Root (as a blind recording engineer).Helping to flesh out the movie is a soundtrack packed with and abundance of ""good-timey"" country-bluegrass classics.  Tops amongst them are Clooney and the boys joined by a Robert Johnson-like guitar player (they pick him up at the crossroads, natch), recording a song as `the Soggy Bottom Boys'.  Their song is supposed to become a huge hit in the narrative, and it's such a joyous number that I can truly see that happening.  And watching them perform it live (twice!) is such a treat, especially since Blake and Turturro do perform some wonderfully ludicrous dance moves.There's so much here that's just plain energetic and ridiculous, you're bound to fall in love with it."	5.0	Amusing Odyssey of the Soggy Bottom Boys	2001-05-29	8	8	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A14XYBN4B7DRLS	Mike Workman	And it isn't just the M. When I heard this was based on the Oddysey, I snorted. However, having seen it, I say it is the best religious cinema since Pulp Fiction. The characters were done so well, I think all three leads deserve Best Actor. The music and scenery were haunting and beautiful, but believable. And who ever suspected that George Clooney and Chuck Berry were separated at birth? If you don't have to change your underwear after the big political rally scene at the end, you need to sleep in a coffin.	5.0	What do Mediterranean and Mississippi have in common?	2001-12-02	2	1	1

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3UVGHUDOY77YR	MissPammy	This was a really entertaining movie with an old-time flavor.  The antics of John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as George Clooney's sidekicks were hilarious, and Clooney's role was central.  I loved their rendition of &#34;I am a man of constant sorrow&#34; which was voiced by a real country singer and his group, and the outrageous hillbilly dancing.  As cute as the movie was, be advised that there was some fairly brutal violence in it that you would not want children to see.  I would characterize this movie as an adventure film that involves a journey.  The three men escape from prison and go through a number of escapades and dilemmas as they meet a sequence of people along the way, some of whom end up being very significant to them in one way or another even though at first glance they don't seem so.  At the same time, Clooney's character goes on an inner journey in which he evolves as a man and outgrows some of his wayward tendencies--although not his vanity, as the constant reminders of his favorite hair pomade, Dapper Dan, show.  The photographic work was exceptionally good.  Throughout, the camera provides that old-time feel, probably through the use of filters, and the filming of the flood scene was amazing.  I would recommend this movie highly for adults.  I plan to watch it again before the rental time is up.	5.0	Loved it!	2014-03-09	0	0	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A27RJ30RN5K9MX	Mitch Weaver	The story is set in Mississippi during the Great Depression. The silver tongued Everett McGill ( George Clooney)busts loose from a prison farm. However, he is still shackled to his two chain-mates from the chain gang - the bad tempered Pete ( John Turturo)and the sweet and dimwitted Delmar ( Tim Blake Nelson). With nothing else to lose, the trio sets off in search of buried treasure that will help them all start new lives. Everett claims that he stole and buried over one million dollars in cash. The only problem is that they only have four days to find it before it is lost forever at the bottom of a reservoir. But as luck would have it, they keep running into strange situations, and even stranger people. The trio steals a car, and eventually pick up a guitar playing hitchiker. To make some extra money, they stop at a radio station and pose as a music group called &quot;The Soggy Bottom Boys&quot;. The record that they cut soon becomes the hottest record in the reigon. However, the adventure does not stop there, as they encounter many more strange characters that include : a blind prophet, a bank robber ( Michael Badalucco), a crooked one-eyed bible salesman ( John Goodman), and Everet's ex-wife ( Holly Hunter)who is about to get re-married. This crazy adventure filled with close calls, near misses, and betrayals will have you laughing every step of the way.Oh man, what an oustanding film. This film succeeds on so many levels. The first is the story itself. Watching the three run into one thing after the next will keep you entertained for the entire film. Next, is the amazing cast. George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturo are all spectacular in their roles. All three are extremely different, but will make you laugh the same. The supporting cast is quite good as well as features performances by Holly Hunter, Michael Badalucco, John Goodman, and Charles Durning. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the amazing soundtrack. It features a wide variety of different artists and each song is spectacular. Dan Tyminksi provides the singing voice for George Clooney on &quot;I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;. This is the Soggy Bottom Boys song that serves as a template for the bluegrass laden soundtrack that also features : Alison Krauss, Ralph Stanley, The Whites, John Hartford, The Cox Family and Gillian Welch.The acting is spectacular, the music is amazing, the story is extremely well rounded, and it is down right hillarious. The DVD is outstanding. You not only get great picture and sound quality, but outstanding extras as well. The DVD offers a behind the scenes featurette, the &quot; I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; music video, and so much more.

Of course I'm the only one in my family that loves George Clooney so that might have helped. The sountrack is GREAT if you love 30's music which I do.

You can enjoy this without ever knowing the story of the Odessey, but I would recommend at least reading the cliff notes for it.  Knowing the Odessey makes the movie much more fun to watch.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	AJTNW79MK6A4C	"Mr. Remoto ""Mr. Remoto"""	"This Coen brothers' retelling of Homer's ""The Odyssey"" is an Academy Award winning modern day classic and the Blu-ray remastering does it justice. My living room theater set-up is reference quality (Integra DTR-50.3, Jamo Concert series surround, Sherbourn 7x200 amp) and I'm something of an audiophile. The ambient sound in this movie has always been in my top 5 and the remastered DTS-HD doesn't disappoint. For two great examples of what true surround can sound like, skip ahead to the scene in which the three escapees are roasting gophers over a fire and a group of born-agains march through their camp like ghostly apparitions to a river baptism. The other great scene is the clan meeting that they infiltrate nearer the end of the movie.As far as the video I would tend to say it's on par with the audio or possibly better. If I remember correctly this movie was one of the first shot on digital media instead of film back in 2000 or 2001. It gave the Coens more control over the saturation effects they used to bleed out the color schemes of the movie, giving it that dusty, southern summer look in yellows and greys. Even though it was shot in digital I believe they still used a 24 frames per second format (or the digital equivalent, anyway). It seemed pretty flawless to me and thanks to the Academy Award winning cinematography it's strengths are on display.I won't get into the actual content of the movie and I have only seen a few bits of the extras so I can't honestly comment on those either but for the blu-ray remastered audio/video I'd say this movie should get a 9.5 out of 10 and that's because I don't think anything will ever be a perfect 10."	5.0	Classic film we remastered	2012-04-09	3	3	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1X910WAOVYV8M	"Nathan ""Cawntry-fried Calypso Beach Bum"""	I am a really big fan of the Cohen brothers. They are one of the most original and wickedly funny filmmaking teams to come along in some time. I've seen just about all of their movies, but of all their great films, I think this has to be my absolute favorite. I didn't go see this in the theater, because I had read some negative reviews of it, but when this came on video, my cousin who works in a video store told that it was hilarious.So one night while his wife was working third-shift, he brought it home and I came over, we ordered a pizza, cracked a few brews, and watched this movie. Let me say that I don't know if I've EVER laughed so hard in my life. It's just a fun thing to watch and listen to.  So many great one-liners and oddball humor, the dialect, the ridiculous situations, the way Clooney sends up his own dapper image, as well as his hopeless attempts to lead the trio.  I just can't get enough of this, fa'real.  They play a group of escaped convicts who are determined to find some buried treasure that Ulysseus CLAIMS he knows where is.  The film is loosely based on Homer's 'The Odyssey', but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy the movie unless you're familiar with the book. I haven't read it since like the 9th grade, so I'm a little dusty on picking up all the references myself, but I still thought this movie was hilarious. I'm gonna have to go back and re-read it someday. The scene right after their encounter with the singing muses at the lake, when Ulysseus and Delmar think Pete has been turned into a toad is absolutely gut-busting.  Then when they come across him in the movie theater... damn, I can't even finish explaining the scene because I'm laughing so much right now just thinking about it.The acting is absolutely superb, particularly John Turturro as Pete who proves once again that he is one of the most underrated and multi-faceted actors working today. The story is comical and always interesting, and the cinematography looks fantastic perfectly re-creating the bleak, dusty, bone-dry Depression Era South of the 1930s. The Cohen brothers are absolute cinematic geniuses and have proven it time and time again over the years. It's just all in good fun. They don't take their art too seriously, and therefore they make TRULY GREAT art.'O Brother Where Art Thou?' is a modern classic, and if you don't get into upon your first viewing, then watch it again and I guarantee you it will grow on you. After my first viewing at my cousin' house I immediately went out and bought this movie, and since then I've watched it probably a good thirteen or fourteen times at least. I mean, I just can't get enough of it. The only recent movie that can even compare to it in terms of originality and entertainment is probably 'Snatch' which incidently I also have watched a ridiculous amount of times. And, on a final note, the bluegrass tunes in this movie are wildly addicitive, even if you don't like that kind of music.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1V6X3STFFESI3	neverwithoutespresso	I cannot recommend O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? highly enough.The Coen brothers skillfully revive classical literature (The Odyessy of Homer) in the story of three wanderers trying to find their way home, and recall American history in a beautifully imaginative, archtypal way.For example, the main characters are three hoboes whose downright stupidity, ineptitude, pathos, and vulnerability are much too exaggerated to be realistic--and that's the point. They're supposed to be emblematic and archetypal, and as such they are a triumph.  They are also hysterically funny.  They are lost, vulnerable, dirty, unlettered but sweet and innocent, hopping freights, trying to keep body and soul together.George Clooney masterfully portrays one of the bedraggled trio, dumb, dizzy, clueless, but handsome and masterful, with more charm than the law allows--indeed he is consciously recalling the legendary charm of Clark Gable with grace.  I'm sure Gable would be honored.John Turturro is also clueless, dumb, and vulnerable, with intensity extreme anguish, and confusion added in.  The combination can't help but make you laugh.  He's the one that keeps ending up in deep doo-doo through no fault of his own.  He emits a silent scream that sends his buddies running to rescue him, stumbling all the way.The third of the team is mild mannered, dumb, confused, innocent, toothless, and incredibly sweet and supportive--up for anything he has to encounter (just like Ulysses).And the challenges are as daunting.  There is a chilling seen of a Klan meeting: There are hundreds of Klan members dressed in those evil, medieval-looking robes with the pointed hats, marching in a circle with burning torches, evoking the monkey guards of THE WIZARD OF OZ and the depraved monks in THE NAME OF THE ROSE.  They are approaching a huge, burning cross upon which they plan to lynch a black man.  This part is not funny.  But, again, it is even larger than life (if that is possible in the case of the Klan) and seems more of an archetype than an attempt to mimic reality.The snippets of folk music on the soundtrack throughut the movie are the icing on the cake.American history and its folkways are clearly close to the Coens' hearts.	5.0	Classical Archetype Meets Humor Meets Pathos Meets History	2006-06-12	4	3	1

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3FD3PH7L4P568	"""niewojt"""	"This is a very good movie.  It was funny and entertaining.  This film was not very realistic, but I enjoyed it any ways.  It was not meant to be taken very seriously, but paints a very real picture of life in the south during the 1930's.  The music is good too--blue eyed blues.The DVD was a good purchase as well.  It includes the video of ""Man of Constant Sorrow"", as well as other footage.This is clearly a good movie about three men who escape the chain gang in order to seek treasure.  The mastermind, Ulysses (George Clooney), appearently lied about this treasure in order to reach his ex-wife before she remarries.  His lie was necessary since the two others were clained with him.  On the way they get into all sorts of situations, including rescuing their friend from a mob and assissting in a bank robbery.  All this in order to remarry an overbearing woman, who seemed disinterested in the father of her own children.  Only after they realize their own popularity as an old-time country act does their fortune change.The movie is 103 minutes, and 24 chapters.  It was orginally released in 1996.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A33TBHM3O9AY17	No one of consequence	Homer's Oddysey set during the Great Depression, with a trio of chain gang fugitives as the protagonists. Who woulda thunk? I don't know either, but give him credit for a fabulously enjoyable movie.George Clooney is magnificent as Ulysses (that's really his name), an extremely witty and articulate convict who is obsessed with two things. The first is finding a hidden treasure from one of his earlier &quot;jobs,&quot; and second is his hair. The contrast between his brilliant and often incisive repartee, and the dull witted utterances of his oafish companions, is truly a sight to behold (can I say that about the spoken word?).The &quot;Odyssey&quot; theme is well developed, complete with Sirens and the Cyclops (played by none other than John Goodman, of course), and the movie loosely follows its plot line. There are some interesting allusions to the supernatural, and some blatant allegorizing of several characters, such as the ubiquitous &quot;boss&quot; sheriff with the fires of hell reflecting from his sunglasses. Several scenes are downright surreal, while others will have you holding your gut with laughter. Oh, and by the way, the good guys manage to &quot;get religion&quot; and turn the popular music world on its head as they go on about their merry way.Literary references aside, though, you'll enjoy this movie immensely even if you've never read Homer. The language is generally unobjectionable, there's no nudity, and minimal non-gory violence, in other words, a family friendly affair. Watch this flick.

Only the Coen brothers could conceive of re-staging Homer's Odyssey in the deep south (complete with a couple of foxy Sirens and John Goodman as an evangelical Cyclops), mixing it up with with a gang of pea-brained runaway criminals, the legend of Robert Johnson, some cross-burning, a weird guy with a dog, a local election and a totally impromptu - not to mention utterly gratuitous - cow-poke country song performance, which the whole film then proceeds to snag itself upon - or congeal around really - and still come up with a thorougly delightful picture. George Clooney isn't even slightly irritating, and the Soggy Bottom Boys' &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; has made instant bluegrass fans out of more people I know than probability would dictate.	4.0	Men of constant sorrow...	2001-06-17	0	0	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3J1BRVN7GXC1E	Optimistix	This movie was quite a joyride, and one must really 'doff one's hat' tothe Coen brothers, the producer-director duo who make 'different' movies.The movie is a take-off of sorts on 'The three stooges' and 'Ullyses',but you may not notice that without looking at the 'production feauterette'- one of the many 'DVD extras' included.The story goes like this : Clooney plays a smooth-talking convict whotells the other two prisoners chained to him at the prison farm thathe'd buried a treasure before getting busted, and they escape, settingout in search of the treasure.They run into a blind old man, who prophesises that they'll have a longjourney, a the end of which they'll find a great treasure, though notthe one they seek. He also predicts that they'll have a great manyadventures along the way.And so begins a roller-coaster ride, which takes you along the tide ofemotions, with many a laugh all along, and a generous dose of greatfolk music (the movie is set in the depression era of 1930s).The acting is great - Clooney's outstanding, and is ably supported byJohn Torturro &amp; Tim Blake-Nelson, Holly Hunter &amp; a plethora of actorswith interesting cameos who keep coming all the time.The direction's even better, as the narrative flows smoothly - youdon't realize where the time goes, and there lots of 'little touches'here &amp; there which underscore the expert direction.But the real highlight is the great music, which is really infectious- in particular 'Man of constant sorrow', which is the showpiece song.I can't help humming it all the time, ever since i heard it !!Coming to the DVD, it's been put together very well - the 'productionfeaturette' gives you an insight into how the Coen brothers work andlittle tidbits about the movie &amp; the actors, and there are 'sneak peeks'and a video of 'A man of constant sorrow', apart from the trailor.But the part that i liked best was 'Painting with pixels', in which youget to know how Computers were used to give the scenes a unique feel.They show you he scenes as taken originally by the camera, and thenafter 'treatment' on the Computers. The 'before-after' difference isamazing ........All in all, a movie &amp; DVD i heartily recommend - two thumbs up :-) !!	5.0	O brothers, thou art great !!	2002-01-28	4	4	0

The blind man could see, and  unlike most secularist, like Everett, who cannot and will not.

A3NFDFNZX300S4	"P. cunningham ""barney rubble"""	O brother where art thou , what can I say , could this be a sign that mainstream America is starting to grasp onto the ideals of European film making. The Coens have surpassed themselves with this film , though Fargo and Blood Simple are both excellent.The Coens have grasped the fact that what makes movies great and will make them be remembered in the future is not special efects and CGI but good old fashioned storytelling and great dialogue .Ok they claim to have gotten inspiration from Homers Odyssey and who am I to disagree , not being a Greek scholar? But what they have created is believable characters that you truely feel for even knowing they are criminals and that by the end of the film they are the ones you are rooting for, how rare is that in modern Hollywood. The Coens still seem determined to make movies that push the boundries of what is classed as mainstream Hollywood. George Clooney does more in this movie to redeem himself from Batman and Robin than I have known any actor to have ever done before , plus I love his homage to James Stewart.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1HUVTK5HHHTK4	Peeps	"OK. I've decided once and for all not to waste peoples' time and give a synopsis of each movie, knowing that it's already been done by the Plot Synopsis.With that said...one of the things one can appreciate is seeing an actor play a character with a style and personality that he/she hasn't performed before.  Such is the case with George Clooney in ""O Brother Where Art Thou"".  In all the films and television shows I've seen that have included George Clooney, I've never seen him perform this character before.  A proud man Everrett, who sees himself as intellegent in the field of modernization and science.  But his world is thrown off balance when he, and his traveling companions Delmar and Pete, set off for home on a path that requires more faith than scepticism.  Homer's ""The Odyssey"" is well adapted, including a blind railway worker as the seer, three prostitutes as the Sirens, and a con man as the Cyclops.The movie caused me to pick up Homer's ""The Odyssey"", translated by Robert Fagles.  It's a very moving and exciting read if you have some time on your hands.Going back to acting, John Turturro's performance is classic.  He maintains the role of a hot-headed escaped prisoner throughout the movie.  And the singing, hillbilly scene with Tim Blake Nelson is hilarious.  Contrast this with his role as the slimy brother in ""Miller's Crossing"".What is amazing is that the music is so well fitted for the plot.  Gospel and blues accompany the escaped convics as they travel seeking a hidden treasure, and is quite appropriate considering the spiritual journey the men are faced with.  It's interesting how Everrett takes a 180 degree turnabout regarding faith, then is quick to dismiss it minutes later.The soundtract is worth getting, and the DVD companion ""Down From the Mountain"" is fun to watch."	5.0	Just some good ol' boys...	2007-02-11	4	4	0

It's an over-the-top funny - and touching - movie about three cons on the run in Mississippi in the 30s. George Clooney, playing  dapper Ulysses Everett McGill, is the thinker, the planner, the schemer, of the impossible trio. He's slick, quick-talking, and funny as hell.John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson play the two side-kicks, dumbos who go along for the ride and add comic bits to the action as the runaways encounter every possible sort of human as obstacles in their path. There's a blind man, a one-eyed crook, sexy singing girls, a Blues guitarist, crooked politicians (is there any other kind?), and so forth.And the soundtrack is so incredibly good that you'll want to go right out and buy it - as I did - and I don't even like country.

While making fun of the Southern ""Christian"" culture, it seems to say that there is a reality behind the fake.  The movie is full of gospel tunes and great music.  The acting is funny to the nth degree.  The dialogue is funny, funny, funny.  I would give this movie 10 stars if I could."	5.0	O, This is Funny!	2003-11-26	3	1	2

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1CSXM5HAD85EW	"playerking315 ""project892"""	So refreshing to see this film when I did....when inane movies like Pearl Harbor clogged the multiplexes I caught this gem at a low budget art house. True, I have recently been introduced to the genius that is the Coens and have been going ape for every thing they have done, but I think this film exceptional and would recommend it to Coen fans and non Coen fans alike.  A good comic performance from the usualy flacid Clooney, usual brilliance from Turturro, and the best of the three, Tim Blake Nelson tie this Homer-based epic together. The synthesis of the writing, directing, and acting was complete and that is at the very heart of good theatre/film- the point when you can't tell who is responsible for the brilliance you are watching.  The Coens have outdone themselves with this hugely comic and ultimately moving romp that leaves nothing left untied, and no plots left unwrapped and explained. Nothing in this film is there without meaning and purpose.  A hillarious supporting performance from John Goodman is only one of the many laurels this film holds in it's ever so eccentric boughs. Immediately arriving on my top ten films list, besides being brilliant, this film inadvertantly contains on of my favorite sequences in film- a thrilling mix of the KKK, the wizard of oz, and a busby-berkley parody.  The Coens have yet to do a commentary track (that being my favorite DVD aspect) but the producers of this DVD have covered it with other goodies- two featurettes and a couple of smaller behind the scenes type deals.  I shouldn't say that the film is brilliant. I should just say that I love it, and that I would highly recommend the film (and the purchasing of the DVD) to anyone who loves great art.	5.0	O Brother, What a GREAT Film!	2001-07-04	3	3	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	The Coen Brother's O Brother, Where Art Thou? is based on Homer's Odyssey and the film is a magical journey through 1930's Mississippi.  The film centers on three escaped convicts who are trying to get to $... that Everett has stashed away at his home before it gets flooded out for a new hydropower network that's being set up.  The three cons are hilariously played by George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson and John Tuturro.  Mr. Clooney in particular shines as Everett.  He fashions himself as an intellectual and his crazed obsession with his hair is hysterical.  Everywhere he goes he must have Dapper Dan pomade and hairnets.  Along the way on their journey, they met a man who sold his soul to the devil in order to play a mean guitar,  cut a record as The Soggy Bottom Boys that, unbeknownst to them becomes a big hit, met three sirens who seduce them, met a crooked bible salesman (played with hilarious gusto by John Goodman) and cross paths with the governor (Charles Durning).  In the end Everett is really looking to stop his wife (Holly Hunter) from remarrying.  The film strings together all of its twists and turns brilliantly.  The acting is first rate, the cinematography adds a brownish hue reminiscent of photographs from the era and of course, the soundtrack has recently won a Grammy as Album of the Year.  All in all, O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a first rate film.	5.0	Coen Brother's Score Again	2002-03-13	5	3	2

No wonder it was nominated for 2 Academy Awards (Screenplay & Cinematography).  It plays out kinda like a hillbilly bluegrass Three Stooges episode.  No foolin'.  George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson are superbly cast in this funny but meaningful look at life in the South.  The soundtrack had me knee-slapping and the song ""I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow"" by the Soggy Bottom Boys is worth a Grammy (if it hasn't already earned one).  And, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention John Goodman's brief appearance as a Bible salesman...priceless.  I've never seen Clooney in such an offbeat role.  It may be his best work ever.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1S3IEVZI29T7H	"Raider Jack ""Jackie D Gray-Romeyn"""	I must say at the outset that I am a TOTAL Coen Brothers fan and have seen ALL of their projects.  This ranks right up there as one of their crowning achievements.This is a re-telling of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; by Homer and after viewing this, I finally got a handle on just what the &quot;Odyssey&quot; was about.  In a nutshell, it follows the exploits of a man and the exotic characters he meets along his journey.  The way the Coen Brothers personified such stalwart literary characters as the Cyclops (John Goodman) and the Furies is most creative.Excellent performances all around from the likes of George Clooney (in one of his most endearing roles), the incomparable John Goodman, Holly Hunter, John Turturo, Charles Durning and a wonderfully strong supporting cast.However, one cannot mention the merits of this movie without a mention of the soundtrack.  It is most obvious that the Coen Brothers invested an enormous amount of research to make sure that the music adequately accompnaied the mood and tone.  A wonderfully indelible example is the use of an acapella song (that utilizes no words, only moans) still used in African-American churches that is beautifully realized.The music in this project is positively spellbinding, regardless of your particular musical preferences - there is something here for everybody.  The soundtrack deserved the kudos it received.This one you will enjoy over and over and over again!!!!Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeexcellent!	5.0	One of Their Very Best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2004-06-16	5	3	2
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3JY8FE2BUCI3	"Randall L. Golden ""randy_golden"""	This movie is best on DVD.  The extra material on the single DVD includes the trailer, the music video of &quot;I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow,&quot; a &quot;making of..&quot; featuring directors/writers/producers Ethan and Joel Coen and &quot;Painting with Pixels,&quot; an intriguing look at the use of computers in making this feature.  While most of the colateral material is the standard stuff, the Painting with Pixels is an interesting foray into the use of computers to create effects on screen and the treatment of the film when completed.  Cinematographer Rodger Deakins explains his job creating the final cut, then the computer artists take over, working with him to get a unique look and feel for the entire film.  I was amazed at the information in this piece.The Coen Brothers generously credit Homer with the top writing credit.  Homer, a Greek poet, wrote The Odessy, upon which the film is loosely base.  Joel and Ethan added the Three Stooges and the Depression-era South, swirled in some instantly likable bluegrass music and came up with a winner of movie.The film begins with the escape of our heros from a chain gang in the backwoods of Mississippi.  Our adventurers are supposedly in pursuit of 1.2 million dollars buried at the home of this Ulysess (George Clooney).  Clooney plays a wonderful Moe Howard, always willing to throw in an esoteric word or two to liven the conversation.  His buddies John Turturro (Larry) and Tim Blake Nelson (Curley) and he try to escape the movie's antagonist, beautifully underplayed by Daniel von Bargen (seemingly straight out of Cool Hand Luke).During their escapades our trio mixes it up with three &quot;sirens&quot; (singing the most alluring version of the old black lullaby &quot;Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby&quot; that I have ever heard), a church choir, a &quot;cyclops&quot; (John Goodman with a eye-patch, stealing his scenes with panache) and the Ku Klux Klan.Don't look for historical accuracy in this film.  The Klan was never noted as either good dancers or good chanters and &quot;Baby Face&quot; Nelson dies in a hail of bullets not the electric chair.But the Coen Brothers aren't reaching out for accuracy.  They are looking for pure entertainment and they achieve this goal.An important note: My wife is not a Three Stooges fan but she loved the movie.	5.0	Fun, great music, a life journey, adventure..	2001-07-12	11	10	1

The use of filters also lent a unique, old-world, feel to the shots (not quite sepia-toned, but similar).

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	ABU7I2Z9M0Q5I	"rballjones ""rballjones"""	"When I saw ""Fargo"" a few years back, I was thoroughly unimpressed. But so many people claimed its virtues, I began wondering if I'd just been in a bad frame of mind at the time.  Having now seen  ""Oh Brother,"" by the same filmmakers, I know my impression of ""Fargo"" was no mistake.  ""Oh Brother"" suffers from many of the same problems.Both films overwhelmingly rely on trite and shallow stereotypes of people (Fargo-Upper Midwesterners;  Brother-Southerners) for their humor-such as it is.  ....  It's one thing to laugh at human foibles, it's another to make disparaging characterizations the central focus of the film-especially when there's little else to commend.""Oh Brother"" skips along, illogically, with subplots that appear and disappear without any development and, often, without connection.  For example, three escaped cons and a guitar player they meet on the road, hornswoggle their way on to a radio broadcast singing a highly polished rendition of ""Man of Constant Sorrow""-although their connection to music up to that point in the film is non-existent.Later, they happen upon three sultry young women (Sirens) in the woods.  The possibilities look good for our three cons when (poof!) two are now on the ground, waking-the third gone.  No clue as to what happened in between.  Kirk Douglas made us live, vividly, through every moment of his encounter with Sirens.  ""Oh Brother"" by contrast, doesn't bother with such details.  It's enough to say, ""We met `em--let's move on to the next scene.""  And don't forget the corn pone.Elsewhere, filmgoers are treated to a train, a mass baptism, a Ku Klux Klan rally, a bank robbery, a swindling Bible salesman, corrupt politicians, hound dogs and a sheriff with mirrored-glasses.  Get the connection?  Hee haw!""Oh Brother"" has been widely associated with a resurgence or discovery of bluegrass music, the soundtrack selling millions.  I, therefore, expected music to be at the forefront of the film.  It isn't really (contrast with ""The Blues Brothers""--where good music is at the fore and the plot is discernible).There are couple of nice bluegrass moments, however.  In one, a group of people are singing as they walk toward a baptismal pool.  In the other, The Whites are on a stage, looking as if they might be the Carter family (the film is set in the 30s)--singing ""Sunny Side of the Mountain.""  But these moments, unfortunately, are short and they don't make up for the rest of the film.I'm puzzled at the connection of this film with bluegrass for one of the things that makes this type of music attractive is its authenticity.  Bluegrass and old-time country is heartfelt, simple music, shorn of pretense and connected with the lives of real people.  But there's nothing at all authentic about ""Oh Brother,"" the film.  In fact, it's almost as if the film is mocking the music.  I was sorely disappointed to hear Ralph Stanley's voice (in its only appearance) coming out from behind a Ku Klux Klan hood.Based on the film, the music on the soundtrack is probably pretty good.  But don't expect the film to be a representation of the spirit of that music."	2.0	Not bona-fide	2003-07-19	31	5	26

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1J2931UBBJPXM	Reviewer	"Producers/writers/directors Joel and Ethan Coen evoke the essence of such classic films as ""Sullivan's Travels"" and ""I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang,"" with their Depression Era comedy, ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" directed by Joel Coen and starring George Clooney.  Borrowing the title of the ""meaningful"" film that successful comedy filmmaker Sullivan wanted to make in the 1941 Preston Sturges film ""Sullivan's Travels,"" and finally-- in reality-- making it, is only the beginning of this clever, funny tale based on Homer's ""The Odyssey.""  The hero here is one Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney), who along with two others, Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson), escapes from a chain gang, commencing an ""odyssey"" for the trio wherein they ultimately traverse many of the railroads, back roads and tank-water towns scattered throughout the good State of Mississippi.  It becomes an adventure of the first magnitude as the three cohorts encounter situations and characters that are humorous and sometimes poignant, and-- for the audience-- always fun.  It's a richly woven tapestry of Americana (including plenty of traditional music) that is bound to leave an indelible impression in the mind of the viewer.  Leading man Clooney has one of his best character roles yet-- it's a Clooney we've never quite seen before-- and he is more than up to the task.  Invested with the mustache and rugged good looks of Clark Gable, and with his natural charisma working overtime, he creates a likable, articulate character that stands out in marked contrast to just about every other character in the film.  And he's a joy to watch; his Ulysses is a real kick from start to finish, and it's a performance that is worthy of an Oscar.  Turturro, as well, creates one of his most memorable screen characters, drawing heavily upon the naturally quirky side of his own personality and accentuating his own unique physical traits which lend themselves so well to the embodiment of Pete.  And Nelson does the same with his Delmar; like Turturro, he successfully captures the soul of the character, both physically and emotionally, and-- it must be mentioned-- both actors (with Coen's help, of course) manage to avoid the trap of making their characters mere stereotypes, and it's one of the reasons they are so engaging:  These guys are the genuine article.  The extraordinary supporting cast, all of whom individually create truly original characters in their own right, includes Holly Hunter (Penny), John Goodman (Big Dan), Chris Thomas King (Tommy), Charles Durning (Pappy O'Daniel), Del Pentecost (Junior O'Daniel) and Michael Badalucco in a memorable turn as George ""Babyface"" Nelson.  Not content to sit on their laurels, the Coen Brothers constantly seek to expand the boundaries of their personal cinematic universe, and they succeed splendidly with ""O Brother Where Art Thou?""  It's a rousingly warm and witty and-- most importantly-- highly entertaining and creative film that takes the viewer on an unforgettable journey.  The Coen's distinct imprint, like the cinematic equivalent of The Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, is stamped on every frame of the film, and it's like an assurance of quality and a good time to be had by all.  There's magic in the movies the Coen Brothers make, and this one goes far toward proving what anyone who has followed their movies over the years knows already:  Nobody does it quite like Joel and Ethan.  This one is not to be missed."	5.0	&quot;Sullivan's&quot; Film Finally Makes It To The Screen	2001-02-12	38	33	5
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A12PXEV350NSWL	Reviews Z. Booke	One of the biggest draws to this wonderful movie is the way the Coen brothers where able to give a unique sense of style and location to this period piece.  From the wonderful cinematography to the highly acclaimed soundtrack, the viewer gets a a stylized version of the southern U.S. of the 1930s.  The storyline, roughly based on the Oddysey, goes throughout the land in a somewhat haphazard, but madcap way.  It's not the end result of the plot that matters, though, it's the journey.  As with other Coen brothers films, the dialogue and regional dialect is a big draw, with the great cast delivering tons of quirky, hilarious sayings.  One note, however, with many Coen movies, I've noticed people seem to love them or hate them.  O Brother might not be everyone's cup of tea, though after many a repeated veiwing, I find it wonderful.  Aside from the film, getting the soundtrack would be quite worthwhile as well.The DVD has a few nice bonuses, the best of which are a couple of interesting featurettes, and the 'Man of Constant Sorrow' music video.	5.0	Another great, yet peculiar Coen film	2001-07-04	3	3	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A12X2J7AVZ04IQ	"R. Gawlitta ""Coolmoan"""	For some reason, I avoided renting this film (now, I think I'll buy it!). I hate to think that I'm swayed by critics, but,in this case, I guess I was. What we have here is a wonderful narrative of three very individual prople, escaping from prison (but &quot;nice guys&quot; so it's OK). Most of their collective motive is greed, but some great bonding ensues, friendships develop (new &amp; old), conflicts happen, etc. Put it in the hands of Joel &amp; Ethan Coen and you have (another) unique blend of movie-making and thought-provoking controlled insanity. I loved this film! What a pleasure to see John Turturro in a somewhat under-control performance. I'm not sure that I've ever heard of Tim Blake Nelson, but he's a brilliant actor (best in the film, I think), truly supporting an incredible performance from George Clooney. The two were a real &quot;pair&quot;. Another reason I avoided this film was it's Oscar nomination for screenplay in the &quot;adapted&quot; category (suggesting its basis as Homer's Odyssey!). How presumptuous, I thought. Well,leave it to the Coen's. I don't know any mistake they've ever made in a movie: &quot;Blood Simple&quot;, best murder mystery ever, &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;, second best comedy ever; &quot;Miller's Crossing&quot;, second-best gangster movie ever; and &quot;Fargo&quot;, their best &quot;everything&quot; movie. I love the Coen's (though I admit I still don't understand &quot;Barton Fink&quot;, though it was a wonderfully scathing comment on the Hollywood movie-making process).There's a continuing, innate sweetness about this film, though it pulls no punches. The Ku Klux Klan is presented as too organized and with political overtones...which may be true, and which may be the Coen's idea to expose this group as heartless and evil as they are (and, especially, were back in the 30's). Tackling some outrageously seriously themes, the Coen's have once again succeeded in making the ugliest of reality seem to be amusing and utterly entertaining. It must be very tough to make light of some of the most horrible moments in history...Mel Brooks did it and so did Benigni; Billy Wilder (Stalag 17) &amp; Stanley Kubrick (Dr. Strangelove). One must admire the creativity &amp; control involved, so as to not offend, present your material and have it accepted. It's called &quot;Entertainment&quot;, and the Coen's deliver this up with side-dishes and garnish on the plate.	5.0	The Coen Brothers did it again...	2001-07-29	2	1	1

Thus when I heard of this movie at the time I couldn't have been more excited: among my favorite directors and music, that's going to be great! WRONG! Dead wrong!This movie is everything the Coen movies are not.Instead of the brothers' usual dark and witty corkiness, we are treated with jokes so juvenile it rivals such classic as ""Dumb and Dumber"".Instead of their habitual pinpoint accurate and fascinating depiction of a particular area, culture, social class, or population segment, we are immersed in some of the worst clich&eacute;s about the South I have ever seen in recent times(Southerners are dirty, racist, retarded, and ""cultishly"" religious. Are we still really at that level of stupid bias).Instead of a solid yet with unexpeted twist and turns scenario, we get a storyline that meanders around nothing and goes literally nowhere (and spare me the parallels with The Odyssey, which merely consist in having a guy with an eye-patch and some deadly girls charming the protagonists).And what the heck were these guys thinking when they cast Clooney, with one of the worst bogus Southern accent that Hollywood ever had the balls to insult us with!?!The two positives about this movie to me was the stunning cinematography and art direction, and the gut wrenching music.The movie recently came up on late TV and I figured I gave it another chance...

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2ONQ1AFSEOCQO	Richard W. Kirkendall	Music is almost never underestimated in movies today.  Just look at any current movie preview, and chances are you'll see a list of artists contributing to the soundtrack, usually popular bands and / or rap groups.  As appealing as these soundtracks sometimes are, especially to the &quot;teenage demographic,&quot; few of these top-sellers actually contribute anything to the storyline and plot movement.  In fact, hearing P Diddy or Smashmouth blare out some tune at a key moment in the movie is often more distracting than it is helpful.That is what makes &quot;O Brother&quot; so special.  The soundtrack is simply phenomenal, and it blends so effortlessly with the rest of the film.  Some people refer to the movie as a musical, which it isn't; but I wouldn't mind seeing a musical with more of the same kind of music.  It is important to note that none of the music I'm referring to is &quot;background&quot; music-- instead, it is all sung by characters in one manner or another.  And the music alone would make the movie worth seeing, let alone the fabulous acting, which others have touched on nicely.All in all, &quot;O Brother&quot; stands as a great flick, dedicated to entertaining us with sight AND sound.  Two thumbs up for the Coens.	5.0	A Winning Formula	2001-11-16	2	1	1
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	AIRMPS9O9RXV7	Rich	I'm not convinced its a classic. The key to this film is the music, and if you hate the music you hate the film. I went to see this movie at the cinema and i loved it, in fact i went back. The directors have put together a montage of colours and images that will im-print themselves in cinemas' hall of fame. I was excited about the release of the film on dvd and bought it on the day of the release, the extra features are minimal, and think they are a lot funnier and impressive than they actually are and the menu is just annoying.The film does have its ups, george is suprisingly good, so good in fact that the critics forgot to actually watch him closely enough to see he is playing a very easy part, with pretty much the same lines repeated over and over in a different order, hair, treasure, hair, wife, moeny, hair. And whilst he babbles on about hair nets (which at first is pure genius but soon rather stupid), the story takes it time to meander through a 'musical' type structure which to be fair is predictable and unbelievable. Paradies to 'homer' will be made, and to be fair i think thats fair, after all the coen brothers announce at the the beginning that the story is based on homer!!Moments to watch out for: The orical figure on the tracks isnt new but sure hits the spot that the rest of the film wanted to focus on! A wonderful musical  rally, on an epic level. And a nice moment at the end with a dog... you'll have to wait and see.Perhaps a rent is a better idea, buy it if you like it the DVD is a good quality.	3.0	A good film, but i'm not convinced it hits the spot!	2001-05-17	5	2	3
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A51QW9KI70Q04	"Richw ""Rliege"""	Don't expect the Odyssey, but expect a very clever movie.  Lot's of fun and you'll enjoy seeing it over and over. The entire cast is incredible, and the songs linger in your mind for days afterward. I bought the CD as well as the DVD, just to be able to listen to it in my car.My wife enjoyed it as much as I did, which really surprised me. She was doubtful, at first, but barely into the film she was hooked. She enjoyed the bluegrass music too, and she has never cared for that type of sound before.Although it's not THE Odyssey, it is AN odyssey, a winding story-adventure. I was surprised that George Clooney could pull it off. Some of the lip-synching was off, with the voice not matching the character.  All in all, we found it a very good movie, and still watch it from time to time.	4.0	Very good entertainment	2002-05-05	2	2	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	AHBNPMHDWZ7SB	RJ Smoove	"The Coen Brothers have to be in my top five, as far as favorite filmmakers go. They're incredibly creative, witty, and abstract. While ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" may not be Joel and Ethan's best, the film certainly has more than enough redeeming qualities to be a pretty enjoyable one. Humor was a constant all the way through, although it was often more subtle than I expected it to be. It took me no time at all to pick up on the parallels between 'O Brother' and Homer's ""The Odyssey"", and going into my second viewing knowing this film was based on that made it even more aparent. The story follows three guys through 1930's Mississippi on a mission to find a burried treasure, that turns out to be more than they expected.George Clooney, John Tuturro and Tim Nelson play Everett, Pete and Delmar. This goes without saying, but George Clooney was fantastic. I've been hearing people say he's overrated a bit too often lately. I call bullshit. He's one of the wittiest, and gives some of the greatest soft-spoken perfoamces that I've seen. Maybe watching this film right after The Descendants allowed me to appreciate his abilities even more. Tim Blake was pretty good as dimwitted Delmar, and I often felt bad for Tuturro's Pete. I especially liked John Goodman's appearance, despite how short it was. There are always memorable moments in the Coen Brothers' films, and O Brother Where Art Thou does not disappoint. It has quite a few memorable moments, and this is the only film I can think of that'll make you both laugh and feel bad for cows at the same time.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	"O Brother, Where Art Thou? (Joel and Ethan Coen, 2000)First and foremost: the person who decided that the score for this film needed nominating for an Oscar should be boiled in lead. Even if some of the other pieces therein were engaging, catchy, etc., the version of ""I'll Fly Away"" that ""graces"" this soundtrack is the very resurrection of the shrieking out-of-tune harridans whose off-key warbling made the soundtracks to so many fifties and sixties musicals unlistenable. Even worse, whatever infernal power resurrected them allowed the decay of forty years of neglect to stay in their vocal cords, and they sound worse than ever.All right, aside from that, this movie was kinda fun. Far more mainstram than one expects from the Brothers Coen, especially with the nose-thumbs they presented society with in their last film, the brilliantly funny Fargo (1996). But they do go on to assert, and with enough backing to make it believable, that no, mainstream does not have to equal crap. They do this mostly the way they always do it-- by getting the finest possible ensemble cast to worm its way through their twisted scripts.In this case, Jason and his Argonauts (you did know it's based-- very, very loosely-- on The Odyssey, right?) are George Clooney, an unrecognizable John Turturro, and the slightly more recognizable Tim Blake Nelson, last scene in yet another cameo in The Thin Red Line. (Nelson's been spending more time behind thecamera these days, having recently finished directing _O_, the newest film retelling of the Bard's play Othello.) They are besieged and beset by some of the more memorable characters from Homer's work, most notably a Cyclopean John Goodman and Michael Badalucco as Babyface Nelson (I know, given the number of roles this guy had, I shouldn't keep referring to him as ""the guy who played Davey Zifrin on Law and Order,"" but jeez, he was SO good in that role...). Add in Holly Hunter, fresh from a stint in the indie world, as Clooney's wayward wife, and you've got a fun little flick. It probably won't be remembered as the height of the Brothers Coen's career, but if you turn the sound off during ""I'll Fly Away,"" it's a worthy enough addition to the corpus."	3.0	Cast: good.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A288BKE773ZLVJ	Robert F vonBriesen	Were things really that bad in Mississippi during the depression? But then, this is  entertainment based on stereotypes and imaginary events so I suppose there is no need for historical / societal accuracy.  As a fan of folk & bluegrass music, I enjoyed the background theme of the music but thought that the escape scenes were a bit far-fetched.  There was no explanation of how 3 white boys could break away from a chain gang with armed guards on horseback watching every move. Later, sneaking into a prison dormitory to rescue one of their trio was also a bit of a stretch.

They do it again with O Brother. Only the Coens could mix Homer with Bluegrass and come up a with a winner.The story is silly and fun and keeps a smile on your face. The music is a much needed cinematic nod to a unique American sound that has been lost to so many of us. The tunes fit the story perfectly and lift the movie to a level of pure enjoyment. Or was the story wrapped around the tunes? Hard to tell and doesn't really matter.There are lots of moments in this film that will leave you chuckling long after you see it: The Siren scene; Clooney's rapid exit from a boxcar; the upside down bloodhound drifting by in the flood; the blind radio station owner (talk about great character actors); Delmar's joyous river baptism; and on and on and on.It's worth noting that the Coens pay tribute here to the wonderful 1941 film &quot;Sullivan's Travels&quot; from which they unabashedly took their title. The ideas for a few scenes seem tie back to &quot;Sullivan&quot; as well, including the boxcar chase.Finally, Tim Blake Nelson is incredible as the sweet half-wit Delmar. Clooney and Turturro seem like easy choices for the Brothers Coen, and both do great work here. But how on earth did they find Nelson? He nearly steals the movie. Sings a pretty mean rendition of &quot;In the Jail House Now&quot; to boot. Who knew?	5.0	The Coen Brothers do it again!	2001-12-23	8	8	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	This is the first film I can remember that starred the musical arranger.  While there are many very, very good things in this film it is dominated by its soundtrack, and well after seeing the movie, after you have forgotten the characters and what they said, you will vividly remember the music.  Burnett also was the musical director for THE BIG LEBOWSKI, and I was tremendoulsy impressed in that one with his musical selections, especially the hysterical Spanish language version of &quot;Hotel California.&quot;  But Burnett outdid himself in O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU?  All of the songs were newly recorded for the film, but each one felt as if it had stepped right out of the 1920s or 1930s, when they were all written.  Every single one of the songs was memorably and magnificently performed, in particular the great traditional song &quot;Man of Constant Sorrows,&quot; whose unexpected success on the radio plays a major role in the movie's plot.(Sidenote:  anyone who loved the version of &quot;Man of Constant Sorrows&quot; in this film owes it to themselves to search out a CD with the Stanley Brothers performing this song.  Ralph Stanly in fact performed one of the songs in the move:  the eerie &quot;Oh Death&quot; performed at the KKK ralley.  The Stanley Brothers consisted of Ralph and his slightly older brother Carter.  As good as Ralph is, Carter Stanley, who unfortunately died in 1966, had almost without question the greatest voice in the history of Bluegrass.  And absolutely no one ever sang &quot;Man of Constant Sorrows&quot; better than Carter Stanley.  Whereas Ralph possesses a fine voice that is somewhere between a low tenor and a high baritone, Carter possessed a high, brilliant, piercing tenor that is one of the glories of American folk music.)The music alone makes this a great movie.  Without it, the movie would have lost a lot of its cohesion and texture.  I am a huge fan of the Coen Brothers, but if you take away the music, this film would probably rate as their weakest film yet with the exception of THE HUDSUCKER PROXY.  The film on its own doesn't quite cohere at every moment, and there are some moments that are just flat out weak.  But as a whole, the movie has a tremendous period feel and a wealth of great minor characters.I thought George Clooney excelled as an escaped convict with a penchant for Dapper Dan hair pomade and sentences that make him sound considerably smarter than he is.So, my recommendation is twofold:  first, see and enjoy the movie.  Second, run out and buy the soundtrack!  This movie just might have the best movie soundtrack to have come out in several years.	5.0	The Star ot the Film is . . . T-Bone Burnett	2001-06-21	1	1	0

But when telling someone about it, I described it as an oddysey, in that the heroes travel from place to place and meeting strange and sometimes famous people with whom they champion their way through difficulties.  Because of the title and the poster images, a lot of people think this is a rather heavy film with some humor. If you want to get a bead on what this film is most similar to in flavor and in its unfolding I would say Pee Wee's Big Adventure. It is laugh out loud funny very early on. And as a bonus you get to listen to a really outstanding soundtrack you may even want to own. I was talking over the film with a friend and we both agreed this was George Clooney's best and most likeable role to date. Perhaps John Turturo's as well. So if you are not fond of either of these actors, set your reservations aside. Oh Brother, Where Art Thou became popular through word of mouth. The audience I saw the film with really was enjoying this film, especially the &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; segment, and you should have a good time as well.	4.0	One of the best 5 films of 2000	2001-06-25	3	2	1

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?""  is ostensibly based on Homer's ""The Odyssey,"" but I have no reason to doubt the Coen Brothers when they say that they've never actually read it.  The film really has nothing to do with that epic poem other than the fact that the filmmakers throw plot elements from the original haphazardly into the mix every now and then.  Need a Cyclops?  Dress John Goodman up in an eye patch to no point or purpose.  Sirens?  Have the main characters stumble across three beautiful women singing and washing clothes by a riverside, even though the scene seems totally contrived and arbitrary in the context of the story.  The Coen Brothers' lack of familiarity with the original is only too apparent.Actually, this is one of their worst films, no doubt about it - slow, arch, disjointed and heavy-handed in both its plotting and its humor.  The original ""Odyssey"" was an epic tale filled with adventure, high drama and great themes involving issues of courage, pride, commitment and love.  ""Oh Brother"" is none of these.  It is, in fact, silly, cramped and trivial.  The role of Ulysses has been assigned to George Clooney, as the leader of a trio of convicts who escape from a chain gang in the Depression Era Midwest.  As they roam the countryside, they encounter a myriad of bizarre, eccentric characters, some derived loosely from ""The Odyssey"" and some not.  None of it really works, partly due to the arbitrariness of the plotting and partly due to the fact that the humor is not very well executed.  In fact, most of the wit consists of having the actors overplay their facial expressions and accents.  As a result of these two factors, the strain never ceases to show.So are there any good things to be found in ""Oh Brother""?  Well, the movie does look good, thanks to fine cinematography and art direction, which beautifully capture the look of the dusty rural countryside of the 1930's.  And there is, of course, the occasional joke or idea that actually does work despite the fact that the film as a whole is a major disappointment.  Perhaps, in the case of this particular Coen Brothers film, the title is inadvertently symbolic."	2.0	Should Be Called &quot;Oh BrotherS, Where Art Thou?&quot;	2001-08-20	23	8	15
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1GDIJFAYH8OXB	Roman	Even though the movie had been released nearly 2 years ago, I still hadnt seen it. It came on tv about 2 weeks ago, and since I sat down and watched it that first time, I've bought the dvd and watched it about 10 times over. Usually PG-13 movies dont do much for me, but when a movie comes along with a great story, great characters, and great writing and directing, its destined for....well, greatness. This movie deserved at least one Oscar, and in my opinion, O Brother is a better, more enjoyable movie than The Coen Brothers' other success, Fargo. This movie has the same cooky style to it, focusing on a culture and region, and exaggerating that. Fargo made hilarious the already wacky accent of Minnesotans, this time around the Coens' made hilarious the already wacky lingo of the south, and bringing light to a dark time known as the depression. I've heard people were offended by the KKK scene, when all the Coen Brothers did was poke fun at the clan the whole time. If you get offended at that, I pray you dont turn on the tv or walk out youre front door, cause reality is much more offensive than a humorous PG-13 movie. George Clooney shows a whole different side of his ability as an actor, and I have new respect for him as a comedic actor, because I know not just anyone could pull off what he has as the dapper man he portrays. If you havent seen this movie yet, you REALLY should. Bravo to the Coens' for having the guts, brains and imagination, to make a movie based around the great Odyssey. Oh, and this is a review of the dvd..... Dolby Digital's good, but DTS is better, and this dvd has it, that's a plus. There's a neat little behind the scenes featurette, featuring the stars and the Brothers, and a cool little extra about the post production process, which talks about the things they were able to do to the movie since it was shot digitally, rather than on regular film. Love this DVD!!	5.0	Who else could stylize and bring humor to the depression?	2002-04-04	3	2	1
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3DK1K26XYXXJN	"Ronald L. Levao ""Ron"""	"This is a wonderfully silly, smart (if maybe smarty-pants) film, weaving together several ""quest"" narratives, the oldest of plots--mostly the Odyssey, but  with many  nods to Sullivan's Travels (including the in-joke title) and the Wizard of Oz (especially the KKK-rescue  scene).  Lots of Americana in it (besides the great music).  It's not necessary to ""get"" the allusions, but I think those who hated the plot misunderstood it.  One criticism, however, does seem valid. O Brother relies on a lot of rural/Southern stereotypes.  The Coens are often smug in their character-mockery.  But the use of grotesque, cartoon-exaggeration is their way into surrealistic farce, and they make brilliant use of it as they do in all their films, taken as a whole:  from suicidal CEO's and personal trainers to rabbinical wisemen.  In their defense here, one might note that the Southern crowd turns against the hypocritical candidate when he begins spewing race-hatred. They want to hear the music. Joy and absurdist hope are as prominent as cruelty and corruption. A great film."	5.0	Quest & Questioning	2010-01-30	1	1	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2XGD133BN97BD	"R. PC ""rando7"""	This is a movie that seems better looking back on it than it does while being watched.  Many scenes are stand-alone works of art, visually and aurally enchanting, and looking back on these scenes will make you think the movie must have been better than it seemed at the time.  The acting is superb (not just Clooney, who is great, but the supporting cast shines with only a couple of exceptions), the music is just wonderful (traditional American music, sweet and haunting), and the cinematography is outstanding.The problem, unfortunately, is that the threads that try to tie this movie together are weak.  My recollection of Homer's Odyssey novel (which this movie is based on) is not that strong, but I don't remember it being a buddy picture where the characters move from one escapade to another with little common goals or plot.  Supposedly the plot is to retrieve some buried money and for Clooney's character to get back with his wife, but so many scenes do nothing to advance those issues at all and are done with such care and spectacle they end up as just confusing.  At the end of &quot;OBWAT&quot; I had to ask myself &quot;what was the point of that?&quot; and I have to answer that the point was to put a bunch of very pretty scenes together.My other beef with this picture is in how it was advertised.  The studio tries to sell it as a comedy, and while there are some funny scenes and I did laugh out loud a couple of times, this is really an art movie.  Don't buy or rent it expecting to curl up with some popcorn and have a laugh riot, you will be disappointed.	3.0	Movie less than the sum of it's parts	2001-12-10	5	2	3
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A387BD735MI50R	R. Schultz	This movie appears to be a random mix of themes and genres.

The result is a scarecrow, a straw man covered in everybody's cast off clothes - out there flapping goofily in the field.No, I don't understand the point or praise of this one.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1IH7JOUIM7DPL	"R. van Pietersom ""ray van p"""	While seeing this movie, a feeling of relaxation came onto me. We see three men escaping from prison (time setting somewhere around 1920) and start looking for their fortune. This brilliant movie (Joel and Ethan Coen, director and writer brothers, made Blood Simple and other great movies) does not explain much to the viewer, but gives you time to enjoy the adventures of these simple minded guys. And that's where Relax! comes in - there's no need to hurry to the plot because there isn't one. After half an hour I started to suspect that this is the truth, no plot? And shortly after that I realized: no problem because it's just a lot of fun. It is a crazy story, with crazy guys. Beautifully shot, nice performances and great props. There are some people in the movie that have to be as crazy as they appear on screen - I couldn't believe my eyes sometimes.Have some time off and laugh your socks off with O Brother!	4.0	Relax!	2002-09-18	3	2	1

As someone who typically finds George Clooney wooden and annoying, I found his performance in O Brother to be absolutely hilarious, and the supporting cast was in perfect harmony throughout the laconic romp through the Great Depression Era South . The music is simply phenomenal- I knew (and still know) next to nothing about traditional country/blue grass/spiritual music, but the cross section of truly fitting music in O Brother has me curious- I bought the album a couple of days after its release. All in all, O Brother was a great movie, and while it wasn't Casablanca or China Town it can more than hold its own against most of the schlock that you'll typically pay eight bucks for.	4.0	Most Underrated Film of the Year	2001-06-06	20	17	3

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB	"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First"""	"""O Brother Where Art Thou"" was an entertaining journey through the Great Depression and Homer's Odyssey. The stellar cast (including George Clooney, John Turturro, John Goodman, and Holly Hunter) shines. All of the characters are quirky to say the least: a one-eyed KKK Bible salesman, a Dapper Dan-obsessed intellectual jailbird, a blues guitarist who sold his soul to the devil, a blind ""prophet,"" the Devil bent on revenge. This is a Coles Notes approach to Homer at best (even the directors, Joel and Ethan Cohen (""Fargo,"" ""The Big Lebowski,"" ""Raising Arizona"") admit to never actually having read ""The Odyssey,"" the story on which ""O Brother"" is based), yet is unusual and highly entertaining in its own right.Fueled by an eclectic soundtrack, ""O Brother"" brought about an unheard-of resurgence of early country music, winning the Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack and outselling most other CDs that year. The selections include gospel, blues, a chain gang song (""Po Lazarus"") and a hobo anthem (""Big Rock Candy Mountain""), along with plenty of toe-tapping country music from The Soggy Bottom Boys (fronted by Union Station's Dan Tyminski), Alison Krauss, Gillian Welsh, Emmylou Harris, and more.The film has an unusual look as well: it was digitally edited to give it the washed-out appearance of the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression. There is a very interesting documentary about this process on the DVD; it is the first film to use this technique in North America (although not in Europe). In fact, there are several interesting extras on the DVD, including a making-of, a music video for ""I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow,""  and a script-to-storyboard comparison. ""O Brother"" is filled with fun, unexpected turns and twists, and a great soundtrack.

Included are clever references to the Cyclops, Sirens, Lotus-eaters and many more.Dapper, smooth talking Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney) breaks free from a road gang with his two dim-witted partners to whom he is chained (John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson).  Together the trio sets out on an epic journey across the state to retrieve a fortune before it is drowned beneath the waters of a man-made lake that will be created by the completion of a dam.  Along the way they encounter a crooked Bible salesman, corrupt politicians, a blues guitarist who has sold his soul to the Devil, a tommy-gun-toting gangster, and the Ku Klux Klan, all the while recording a hit record that tops the country charts.Beautifully photographed in a sepia -colored haze, chock full of traditional bluegrass music, brilliantly written and directed by the Coens, who  elicit wonderful performance from the three leading actors, as well as supporting players like John Goodman, Holly Hunter and Charles Durning.This is one of those love `em or hate `em movies .

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2RN2AO4BE6F4K	"Scott Bright ""scottypotty"""	Movie Summary:  It's the 1930's in Mississippi and Ulysses Everett McGill has just escaped from a chain gang. He still has part of the chain and it attaches him to his fellow inmates Pete and Delmar. Together this threesome is trying to recover a buried treasure before it is covered by the new lake that will be formed when the river is damned. Along the way they meet a Cyclops, sirens, and a soulless guitar player. They hitch a ride with George Nelson (don't you dare call him &quot;baby face&quot;!) and form the Soggy Bottom Boys. All the while being chased by a devil of a prison guard.My Opinion:  This is an offbeat movie. Not only is the story different, but the entire feel and color of the movie is different. While some people may have problems dealing with the differentness of this film, I found it very refreshing. It was fun to watch a movie that had themes, motifs, and allusions to other classic stories. I enjoyed the story and the music very much. The Soggy Bottom Boys know how to rock! George Clooney is in great form. He always plays himself in every movie, but there is nothing wrong with that. He fits in great here. It was even fun to see the Dapper Dan Man making fun of himself.DVD Quality: Widescreen anamorphic - 1.85:1 my favorite since it fills the entire screen on my portable DVD player! Making of Feature, Soggy Bottom Boys Music Video.What You Should Do:  Check it out. It's different so you'll probably love it or hate it.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2J9L1COE71AJL	Scott Hartig	Just how it is that hollow and boringly common films like Chocolat and Erin Brockovich got nods for Best Picture over this terrific little film is beyond me.  What a memorable and gorgeous motion picture this is!The stars of 'O Brother' aren't George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson.  Nor are they even Joel and Ethan Coen, the masterminds behind the project.  Indeed, the real stars of this film are the music and the cinematography with a supporting effort by the script.  All three are so masterfully crafted that they actually accomplish overtaking outstanding performances by the entire cast and become the stars of the film.Roger Deakins, the genius behind such other aesthetically beautiful films as 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'Kundun', 'The Secret Garden', and several other Coen brothers films, really brings the Depression-era South to life with very dusty earthtones and deep, sun-drenched oranges and yellows.  Deakins' visuals in 'O Brother' are so textured and real that I swear I felt myself sweating along with the chain-gang workers as they sang their worksongs.The legendary T-Bone Burnett oversaw the marvelous music in the film.  By mixing some actual country-blues hits from the era (such as &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot;, &quot;A Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;, and &quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain&quot;), Burnett provides the Coens' and Deakins a firm and beliveable canvas on which to paint.  As astounding as the visual aspects of 'O Brother' are, the grandeur of the film really rests more on the aural landscaping.  The filmmakers obviously spent a lot of time and money on the music and this effort pays off in big, big ways.The writing is classic Coen.  They (purposely) exaggerate the local dialect (much like they did in Fargo, Raising Arizona, and others) and don't have to rely on cheap sight gags or crude jokes to get laughs.  'O Brother's' laughs aren't bellylaughs, mind you.  Instead, they accomplish subtle humor through the sheer determination - not to mention incompetence, innocence, improbable success, and all-around lovebility - of the Clooney character and his numbskull accomplices.Of course, the story is loosely based on Homer's &quot;The Odyssey&quot; and the Coens are properly respectful of the epic.  Anybody familiar with that poem will immediately recognize many of the characters and incidents.  And the plotline requires some significant payment of attention - much like Homer's work does.  However, the Coens raise the stakes of fun and spice up the story by using real-life (or near real-life) characters from the Depression:  Babyface Nelson, Robert (aka Tommy) Johnson, Pappy O'Daniel, etal.This film probably isn't so much for the weekend-night-out types as it is for fans of classic literature, early 20th century American history and music buffs, and students or admirers of art-house cinema (though it certainly was something of a mainstream hit).  I think this explains why there seems to be so much dissension in the reviews here.  Viewers seemingly either loved 'O Brother' or hated it.Frankly, I think the music and cinematography alone are enough to deserve a look-see.  Even if they don't know &quot;The Odyssey&quot; or care very much for the typical art-house film, I think most moviegoers will find something about this gem to love.  I imagine the respect and value of 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' will go markedly up over time.  It's just too special a film to have garnered the relatively small amount of attention and love it has.	5.0	One of 2000's (and the Coen brothers') best....	2001-06-11	4	4	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	While my favorite Coen brothers' film is &quot;Miller's Crossing,&quot; &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; is my favorite comedy by these two mavericks.Loosely based on Homer's &quot;The Odyssey,&quot; earning an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay even though the Coens' admitted to reading only the Cliff Notes, &quot;O Brother&quot; is the Coens' tribute to American bluegrass music.  For some reason, this movie was shamefully snubbed at the Oscars, but George Clooney earned his Golden Globe award for best actor.Clooney plays the fast-talking Clark Gable wannabe, Ulysses Everett MacGill.  Unfortunately for Ulysses, his mouth runs about five steps ahead of his brain, and his delight in the clever, hyper-articulate use of the English language cannot mask his delightful naivete.  In a performance of sly self-mockery (can you think of another major film star who would so earnestly ask for a hair net to sleep in or speak movingly about being a &quot;Dapper Dan Man&quot;?), Clooney steals one heck of a show.Ulysses escapes from a chain gang in Depression-era Mississippi with his sidekicks, the hot-blooded Pete (John Turturro) and easy-going Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson).  Allegedly going to find some treasure before a river gets dammed, sinking the treasure beneath a deep lake, this trio begins a bizarre journey across the Deep South.Along the way they meet guitarist Tommy Johnson, who followed an American musical legend by selling his soul to the devil at a crossroads in exchange for the ability to play the guitar, Big Jim Teague (the Cyclops), three Sirens, a blind seer, Baby Face Nelson, a spelling-challenged rifle-toting youngster, and Governor Pappy O'Daniel (conveniently relocated from Texas to Mississippi).  Recalling the ultimate road story of the Odyssey, &quot;O Brother&quot; breezes from episode to episode with delightful ease.As ever with Coen brothers' films, the movie looks wonderful and feels authentic.  You can feel the oppressive heat of the Mississippi sunshine, you choke on dusty roads, and you glory in the greens and yellows of the languid countryside.  Unlike so many films set in the Old South, characters are fully-realized (even if hilariously flawed) rather than caricatures.  The minor details of daily life in the South (a mild oath from Ulysses gets a stern warning -- &quot;Watch your mouth, young feller, this is a public shop&quot;) are delightful touches.Of course, the true star of this movie, other than Clooney, is the soundtrack.  Almost solely responsible for the recent Bluegrass explosion, &quot;O Brother&quot; lovingly grounds this musical genre in its appropriate time and space, and the songs form a perfect accompaniment to the rest of the movie.  When the congregation sings is gospel tunes, or Pappy O'Daniel leads the Soggy Bottom Boys (what a name!) in a rendition of &quot;You Are My Sunshine,&quot; the powerful force of music resonates throughout this delightful film.One of the best movies of recent years, it's hard to understand why &quot;O Brother&quot; was so snubbed by the Academy.  Like other recent snubs (e.g., &quot;Shawshank Redemption,&quot; this movie is sure to generate more critical acclaim as it ages.Whether it's for the wonderful acting, terrific writing, or amazing soundtrack, &quot;O Brother&quot; should be in your collection!	5.0	The Best Coen Comedy!	2004-05-07	12	11	1
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1NRHJW5X9COX	Scrivener	&quot;O Brudda&quot; is like, sheer freekin GENIUS.

Bad hair day? All you need is Dapper Dan and a hairnet. Boo-yaahhh!The gopher-on-a-stick was pretty funny, as well. John Turturro's stint as a toad was also GENIUS ...I liked Clooney repeating the mantra &quot;We're in a tight spot!&quot; when a posse finds our heroes holed up in a barn. The movie looks great. Sounds great. Is great. Clooney's the pater familias, and the Devil has a red, bifurcated tail. You will LAUGH when Don't-Call-Him-Babyface Nelson kills cows, and you will LAUGH harder when the cows get their revenge!  The KKK-Dance Scene is just weird enough to merit a musical of its own:  perhaps the Coens should take it to the Great White Way in NYC and use it as an opener to Mel Brooks'  &quot;The Producers&quot;!

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1R3WRV2ES39C5	Sean Purcell	Homer's Odyssey, re-figured as a myth of the Depression-era South... and a satire... and a love song.  O Brother is in my Top 5.What ties this movie together is the intelligence that pours out of every frame and every line of dialog.  (Think &quot;Rushmore&quot;).  Slice this movie along any axis:- Intellectualism / Book Learnin'.  It's based on Homer's Odyssey -- Come on!  Top that off with dozens of quasi-historical references that I don't even get.- Satire.  It goes from big and blunt (&quot;The KKK Scene&quot; is the best KKK treatment I've ever seen) to so subtle and detailed that you barely notice it (look at the earnestness on Delmar's face when he sings &quot;I am a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;!)  But how can the movie be a satire when it revels so much in the lush mythology and history (good and bad) of Mississippi?- Music.  More perfectly woven into this movie than any I've seen.  (And no it doesn't hit you over the head like musicals do.)  It sounds trite, but you *will* be singing these songs after the movie.  And you might even want to buy the soundtrack and put it next to your Radiohead CDs.- Cinematography.  Just gorgeous.- Acting.  In some ways the weakest part of the movie -- George Clooney was great, but only got to 95%.  John Goodman was... John Goodman.  But for some characters, brilliant.  I absolutely believed that Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) was a dumb hick, even though I know it's impossible.  And the blind Radio Station Man (Stephen Root aka Milton the Red Stapler Guy from Office Space) was genious.- Beauty.  See Music and Cinematography.- Dialogue.  It takes the deepest intelligence to write this way.  Strongly characterized, referential, regional, colloquial, and so so funny.  Ulysses' rhetoric is priceless.  And Delmar's southernisms slip in so smoothly that you forget to ask - how did two brothers from Minnesota write this?- Cheer Factor.  Damn!  Those boys can sing!And it's funny as hell.O Brother is one of those movies that I can play again and again like an album.  You know the story, but who cares -- you just want to sit back and marvel at the work.	5.0	O Muse!	2001-07-06	8	7	1

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A25IIPLKRQ7519	"Shannon Riley ""writer and publisher"""	"O Brother, Where Art thou is a dark comedy imbued with shades of the mystical.  Based on ""The Odyssey"" by Homer, it is set in hard-hit Mississippi during the 1930s Depression.  Everett Ulysses McGill (George Clooney), desperate to get back to his wife and family, escapes from a Parchman chain gang with cantankerous Pete (John Turturro) and sweet, clueless Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) and begins the long and arduous journey back home.  Along the way, the three adventurers meet a host of interesting characters, including George ""Baby Face"" Nelson and, with a bow to ""The Odyssey,"" three beautiful Sirens, a blind prophet and the Cyclops (John Goodman).  They join forces with Delta bluesman Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King), who is reputed to have sold his soul to the devil for musical fame, and manage to save him from a Klan lynching.George Clooney is perfect for the lead and John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson are wonderful in their supporting roles.  In fact, the entire cast turns in outstanding performances.The Coens describe the film as a ""Ma and Pa Kettle film with high production values,"" and that is certainly true.  The settings are true to the period and the artistic filming is in tint similar to the photography of the day.  Like photos from an old family album, scenes bring a touch of nostalgia for a way of life forever gone.The folk, bluegrass and spiritual music are perfect for this story and add authenticity to the tale.  In the film, Clooney, Turturro, Nelson and King, calling themselves the ""Soggy Bottom Boys,"" cut a record entitled ""I am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" to earn money.  Clooney lip-syncs the song, which is actually sung by Dan Tyminski.  Tim Blake Nelson himself performs the song ""He's in the Jailhouse Now,"" also in the film.  The Soggy Bottom Boys' guitar accompanist, Chris Thomas King, who also performs the Skip James' blues song, ""Killin' Floor Blues,"" is an accomplished blues musician and recording artist in his own right.The writers obviously did their research well.  The Southern politics and methods of campaigning, the Appalachian folk music and Delta blues, and the country customs, the dialog and expressions are right on target.  This film tells a story that is far more than just a comedy.  As a life-long resident of Mississippi, I found it touched me on so many levels.  The baptismal scene was awe-inspiring, the Klan meeting chilling.  The film encompassed everything I both love and hate about my great home state.  Even in its most comedic moments, it whispered truths.O Brother, Where Art Thou garnered two 2002 Academy Award nominations:  Best Adapted Screenplay (Joel and Ethan Coen) and Best Cinematography (Roger Deakins).  For his work in the film, George Clooney received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy.Brilliantly produced and directed, from the cast to the script and the setting, this movie is as good as it gets.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3PIJJ4J2DDI6Q	"Shawn M. Warswick ""High School History Teacher"""	In their latest film, O Brother Where Art Thou?, the Coen Brothers use their quirky mix of humour and high brow production to satirize Homer's The Odyssey.  Set in depression era south, the film is the comic saga of three convicts on the run done only as the Coen's can.Like all of their other films, this one contains an ensemble cast of characters unique and compelling.  First, we have Ulysses Everett Mcgill (played to the hilt by George Clooney), a smooth talking man with a streak of vanity a mile wide.  He has a tendency to repeat things (as most Coen characters do) and has a thing for his hair and hair pomade.  George's performance shows he is an actor capable of true greatness.  Why he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this performance is beyond me.  The good thing is it garnered a Golden Globe for him, and was well earned.John Turturro makes an appearance in this film as well (seems like he is in almost every Coen film).  Here he plays the serious side kick named Pete and delivers a great performance in this role.  The best part is his reaction to The Sirens.  Not quite as good as his performance in The Big Lebowski (that was the best!) but nonetheless, quite good.All of this is set against a backdrop of beautiful scenery and wonderful cinematography thanks to longtime Coen Brother's collaborator Roger Deakins.  Once again the technical aspect of the film is right on the money, the film is stylish without being campy.  The musical score, supplied by T Bone Burnett, is a wonderful amalgamation of blues, bluegrass, gospel and more.I can highly recommend this film if you wish to add a bit of Coen brother quirkiness to your collection.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	AP3V63JVKLEO5	Sherman A. Thompson	Don't take my word for it; read the other five-star reviews.  They cover just about all of my observations well and there's no need to repeat them. I am in my 70's and remember the great depression well. It was another world that this flick depicts accurately, albeit without all of the intense sorrow that also went with those hard times.  Judging from the automobiles and events depicted in this film it was set in 1938, give or take a year. It brought back many personal memories.There really was a Governor &quot;pappy&quot; Lee O'daniel who was associated with a flour company and a country music group, but the real one was governor of Texas (not Mississippi) from 1939 through 1941, defeating Lyndon Johnson. I can still remember Lee O'Daniel's Light Crust Doughboys on the radio every evening.  The catch phrase in their bumper music was &quot;Please pass the biscuits, pappy.&quot;Casting in the film was perfect. Many locals were undoubtedly used because no actor could depict the country characters so authentically. The music was as it really sounded back then.  It was refreshing to escape to the real thing without today's slick and professionally perfect plastic sounds. The songs were truly representative of the era, as I remember it.This is a relaxing, refreshing, no-think film that works well on many levels. Every time you see it you see something you missed on previous viewings.  I completely missed its esoteric parody of Homer's Odyssey the first two times.If you are in the mood for a fast moving, outrageosuly funny comedy that doesn't require delving into heavy, dark, brooding, depressing, and stressful psychological concepts, then this is the film for you. Even the manic-depressive behavior of &quot;Babyface&quot; Nelson was depicted in an hilarious manner.This film consists of many sub-plots, all masterfully woven together into a coherent string, each serving as a vehicle for great comedy and wonderful country music as it was played, sung, and heard in the 1930's. I can't praise this film enough. It should have received many top awards, but we all know that awards are based on advertising budgets and Hollywood politics, not quality of the craft.See this film once and you will want your own copy to view over and over again.  The kids will also love it.	5.0	WHAT A DELIGHTFUL LARK! ONE OF THE ALL-TIME GREAT COMIDIES	2003-01-01	4	3	1

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3BZYC9YAQOCE4	"""silevine28"""	"I watch a lot of movies and have seen all of the ""classics"" and O' Brother Where Art Thou rates among the best of them - no kidding! Twenty years from now, they'll be airing this film on AMC and TCM alongside the likes of North by Northwest, The Wild Bunch and How Green Was My Valley.The story is completely engrossing and the cinematography is stunning.  Realize that filming took place in June/July when the Southern countryside was a lush, verdant green. That bone dry, depression-era dust bowl aesthetic is a wonder of digital editing.The Coen brothers have done two things that are all too rare in Hollywood these days.  First, their screenplay is original (yes, it's loosely based on Homer's Odyssey but to evaluate the film solely on this narrative framework is to overlook the other aspects of the film). Second, they've produced a film that captivates not with multi-million dollar action sequences and the latest Moby track but with great dialogue and an authentic blues/bluegrass soundtrack (well worth buying) that is as much a character in the movie as the three principals - Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson) and Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro).  The eclectic cast (that also includes Charles Durning, Holly Hunter, Stephen Root and John Goodman) turns in superbly acted performances across the board.  Clooney, who all too often plays 2 dimensional characters, gives an award-worthy performance in what is unquestionably his best role to date.  Those not familiar with Nelson or Turturro will be impressed by these wonderfully skilled actors.I will say that a lot of people have told me that they didn't care for this film, which I find incomprehensible.

I guess &quot;loosely&quot; is a key word here; you won't find much Homeric imagery in this movie.But one thing that does seem to be adapted from Homer is the style of the story, which is not so much a single plot as a succession of adventures loosely strung together. Here the Cohen brothers did a good job of constructing a series of adventures that are worth the telling, and are up to their usual standards of presentation.I found the prominent use of bluegrass music throughout the movie a little hit-and-miss.

Bros are giants in a race of pygmies.At the heart of their work are three of the finest films ever made in the United States, made consecutively, ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"" and this. One of the glorious things about these three films is how different they are. ""Fargo"" is a police procedural and morality tale set in the snowbound backwater of Minnesota, ""Big Lebowski"" a glorious send up of film noir set in the asinine wilderness of Los Angeles. ""Oh Brother"" is a musical epic, an enchantment, set in Depression era Mississippi. If the idea here is to signal which movies are not simply worth seeing but specifically worth buying, where a movie worth buying is a movie that will delight not just on a single viewing but repeatedly, on viewing it again and again, all these three movies are eminently worth singling out. I've seen them all several times now and they just get better.  Many movies get to be classics because of just one or two scenes that have some peculiar magic. This movie is composed almost entirely of such scenes.In essence it's a comedy and seems to spring from an almost infinite well of comic invention. Here we get George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill, the smooth talking ""Odysseus"" character with his loquacity and vanity, John Goodman as Big Dan Teague, the one-eyed ""Cyclops"" (with an neat pun on that word's murky second life as a term for a KKK officeholder) bible salesman and thief, Michael Badalucco as George ""Baby Face"" Nelson the manic depressive cow-hating bank robber, Stephen Root as the strangely manic blind recording engineer and radio station manager in the middle of nowhere, Wayne Duvall as Homer Stokes the KKK-affiliated candidate for governor with his performing midget, Charles Durning  as Menelaus ""Pappy"" O Daniel, the incumbent governor, terrified of losing, Holly Hunter as Mrs ""Penelope"" McGill who has told her army of children that her fallen ex-husband was run over by a train, Ray McKinnon as her suitor who, inverting the Homeric source, is more than a match for Everett in a bout of fisticuffs,  Lee Weaver as the ""Tiresias"" character, the blind driver of a handcar, and Daniel von Bargen as an avenging angel, the sheriff, who is also at once The Devil and the Greek God Neptune. All the above act like people who never expect to be offered a better-written part and many of them never will. Quite good comic films could be made from one twentieth of the cinematic ideas on display here. The Coens just have such an abundance of them, they toss them off, exult briefly in them, and them move gaily on to the next. If there's one quibble, it might be Pete and Delmar, McGill's companions, who have escaped with him from a chain gang. While Walter Sobchak in ""The Big Lebowski"" was not merely an idiot but a magnificent, outrageous idiot of Dickensian dimensions, these two, though certainly well enough acted by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, are much closer to being stock comic characters whose plain unembellished dumbness is intended to render them funny. If ""Big Lebowski"" is a better comic film, as I think it is, I'd single that out as a reason why.As well as the Coen's, the movie's magnificence owes a large debt to T Bone Burnett who put the music together. It's very much a musical and the soundtrack is pure heaven to listen to, especially those items involving the marvellous singing of Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch. Though if there is one slightly off note here too, it is Ralph Stanley's ""O Death"" sung by a hooded KKK chief who turns out to be Stokes. Not only is credulity strained in supposing Stokes could have a singing voice remotely like Stanley's but it seems far too cool a song to be found on the lips of so desperately uncool a character. But again now I'm splitting hairs. This is a classy, classy movie and a pure joy to watch."	5.0	An embarrassment of riches	2003-12-08	12	11	1
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3LDSD574010LM	snorsicgsn	The picture will cut off on the sides at certain points in the movie in many of the night scenes. Also the top black bar will come down into the picture at times ruining the viewing pleasure. There is no quality control, and the company making these discs should be shot.

I'm always a little wary of period pieces set in the 20th century south but I think the Coen brothers brought the right mix of comedy and larger than life characters to re-tell the Odyssey.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2LICSQ2IFE3C5	"SPM ""scott_maykrantz"""	After The Big Lebowski, the Coen brothers refined their approach to movie-making. They stuck with the idea of including any idea that was funny and slightly strange, but this time they imposed a plot that made sense. Like Fargo --- which was supposed to be based on a true story but really wasn't --- Oh Brother Where Art Thou is based on the Odyssey (a seemingly true story that they could use when it served them, or dump when it didn't). Then they  added the Depression, southern politics, and lots of music.If this had been written and directed by anyone else, it would have been a mess. But with the Coen brothers, it's a musical comedy disguised as a screwball period piece. It helps that the casting is perfect. From the three principal actors to the major secondary characters (like John Goodman's Big Dan Teague/Cyclops) to the smaller parts (like the governor's two dim-bulb campaign managers and the radio station owner) every actor is funny and perfectly in sync with the tone of the film.The Coens added quite a bit of computer effects and all of it works. The obvious example is the color-grading. The short documentary on the DVD shows how computers were used to wash out colors and tint different scenes. Then there are small parts, such as the underwater shot of Dapper Dan cans and a dog floating  by. Those cans are computer-generated, and the dog was composited into the shot. You don't notice this stuff until the third or fourth time you see it. Once you notice, it makes the movie even better.This is one of the best Coen brothers movies, and one of the best movies of the last 10 years. The music is so good, you'll be humming every tune the day after you see it. It's very funny and beautifully designed, as well.	5.0	A musical odyssey in Mississippi	2003-12-10	8	6	2
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3HPOCPJJQNMWN	SS-3	This movie is loosely based on the Homer Odyssey and centers around three escaped convicts in the south during the depression. One of the convicts (George Clooney) has escaped to stop his wife from marrying another man. He persuaded the other two convicts to follow along with him promising them hidden loot from a heist. The movie has its high and low points but never fully engages the audience. There are a few memorable scenes such as the Sirens and the flood scene. The music really is a big part of this movie and sets the tone. It is an older style Deep South country style that will not appeal to all and if you do not like the music you will not like the movie since the music is an integral part of the movie. After viewing this movie it left me with a neutral feeling. I did not despise it nor was I crazy about it. The video transfer is an excellent 2:35 Anamorphic transfer that shows no signs of edge enhancement. The colors are clean and crisp even in the darker scenes. The Audio track options are DTS 5.1, Dolby 5.1, and Dolby 2.0. The DTS track being the best with good channel separation and dialog focused on the center channel.	3.0	Neutral best describes this Movie	2001-10-29	0	0	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3LSK9Z0DAMRWV	Stacy A Conner	Let me just say God Bless the Coen brothers. These two guys from Minnesota have given us some of the most original and funny movies of the last 20 years. After releasing a modern day classic with &quot;THE BIG LEBOWSKI&quot;, the Coens then gave us the depression era comedy &quot;O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?&quot;. With the Coens you never know what to expect, but you know it will always be a well made movie that gets better with repeat viewings. This movie ranks in the Coens top 3 behind &quot;FARGO&quot;, and just ahead of &quot;RAISING ARIZONA&quot;. The movie has top notch performances from John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, John Goodman, Charles Durning, and if you ask me a very Oscar worthy turn by George Clooney. One of the Coen brothers great talents is too paint a great picture of when and where the story is taking place, and this movie falls right in line. Set in the heart of the Mississippi during the depression, Clooney and his partners in crime travel thru absolutely beautiful delta land in search of their goal. Just watching it makes me want to sip on an ice cold lemonade, no kiddin'. The film transfer and colors are excellent on this release. Basicly, you've got a great movie with great performances, but this all actually takes a back seat to the best part of the movie, the music. Leave it up to the Coens to bring roots music back to the to the attention of music fans everywhere. The music is great, fits right in with the story, and the sound on this disc is perfect. Definetly no complaints with the movie, a must see. The disc includes a cool but not long enough featurette, post production process, the Soggy Bottom Boys music video, theatrical trailer, and a very interesting script to storyboard feature. My only wishes were maybe some deleted scenes, and the ever elusive Coen brothers commentary track. Neither of which appear on this disc, but hey, I can't complain with the overall quality of this movie and disc. This will make a great addition to any collection. Enjoy movie and DVD fans.	5.0	Must have DVD for your collection!	2002-05-22	0	0	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1HZFWDL7MOSFQ	Stephen Fleschler	I want to add the other famous movie sequence which occurs at the KKK rally.  The Wizard of Oz.  Notice that the three overtake three guards (aka monkeymen) and are on a quest to save a decent person (blues singer - Dorothy).  The fire is a predominant factor in hurting the singer (Witch's broom on fire).  My first thought was that this scene was lifted from the Wizard of Oz rather than the Busby Berkeley aspects, the later of which are apparent in the choreography of the march scene.  Otherwise, there are many layers of tributes to old films which added to my enjoyment - my family's film of 2000.	5.0	Did anyone mention the other famous movie sequence?	2001-06-18	2	2	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A3U56M0Y8LYO6J	"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict"""	"The Coen Brothers bring the story of Homer's The Odyssey into the twentieth century in ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" and the result is a mixed bag.  The film follows Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro), and Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson) through Mississippi during the Depression years as they come into contact with a number of colorful characters and situations.  The Coens do a wondeful job of capturing the mood of the era by populating the film with bluegrass music and images of chain gangs, cotton fields, hobos, and bogus medicines, but these assorted elements never mesh.  The film seems to be just a jumble of component parts that don't add up to anything when put together.  There's a semblance of a story at the outset when McGill recuits his two cohorts to help him find a hidden treasure but this story thread becomes lost among a Klan rally, an encounter with sirens, meetings with pompous politicans, and a picnic with a Bible salesman.  I realize the point of the film is to chronicle the adverturesome trials and travails of the journey from point A to point B, but the stops along the way just aren't interesting enough to keep you involved.  When the journey concludes, you feel unsatisfied because there wasn't a grand pay-off that justified the time you invested in the film.  The bottom line is that ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is filled with wonderful music and visuals but is frustratingly empty in the substance department.  Clooney, Turturro, and Nelson all give good acting turns but their efforts feel wasted.  When Ulysses Everett McGill yells ""Damn! We're in a tight spot!"", he might have been talking about all the problems apparent in the script."	2.0	"""Do not seek the treasure!"""	2003-01-26	29	14	15

Oooops, scratch the latter - somehow the hillbilly South managed to produced a Rhodes Scholar Hollywood-liberal icon and if we admit that, it threatens all the stereotypes this film depends on.

I think he is a wonderful actor, but I saw him as being Doug Ross in the Depression Era South, and that didn't work for me. But I wanted to see it because I am such a music fan, and come on, this is some great musical work!  However, I will proudly admit that I couldn't have been more wrong about George. I now know that Clooney is one of the best actors of our time and he truly gave an excellent performance. His comedic performance in this movie was unparalleled! This is now one of my favorite movies and I hope that Clooney is given many more roles that let him expand his talent, so that he isn't typecast as the handsome rogue in everything.  There is much more to him than that.  As always, John Turturro gave an outstanding performance, as did Holly Hunter and John Goodman...LOVE HIM! And I fell in love with Tim Blake Nelson's Delmar. This movie should be on everyone's list of favorites and you HAVE to buy the soundtrack.  And back to Clooney....wow!

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	AWILLSV3J6T9X	The end is	I'm not a big Clooney fan, and I barely remember the Odyssey, but this was my favorite movie of 2000. It was quirky and out of the ordinary, but still hugely entertaining, which is tough for these kind of movies, since it's so easy to ruin them. The combination of mood, music and humor make this a must see for anyone. I picture the 1930's South more like this than the great classic movies such as Grapes of Wrath (in which life was always miserable)and the screwball comedies (where life was great).  Life was tough, but people still lived there lives and still tried to enjoy what they could.  I've seen this movie 4-5 times and listen to the soundtrack often.  It also gave me a new appreciation for old time southern/bluegrass music that I never had before.  I think this is easily the best movie that the Cohen Bros have done, and hope they do more like it.  The music from the baptism and the Sirens was terrific.	5.0	And now for something completely different...	2002-01-27	1	1	0

Incidentally, I live in Manurewa Auckland New Zealand.I found the sound track on an on-line music site; loved the music so much that I hunted for & purchased the DVD. It was out of distribution in New Zealand so I had to go ""off-shore"".I found it to be a grass roots DVD & not everybody would appreciate the music showcased in the film. ie: It is aimed at an audience that likes the Southern States culture & music of the 1930s.This Reviewer enjoys the type of music showcased in the movie, so gave it a five(5) Star rating."	5.0	This is a Technical Review.	2008-01-07	0	0	0

I had not heard of the movie, I had seen no reviews.  Day after day I considered it, but passed it by.  Then a friend at work mentioned that he was looking forward to renting it for the third time, for a relaxing weekend.  He was in love with the &quot;Old-Timey&quot; music.  When my parents were here for Thanksgiving, I was looking for a movie that would appeal to them, and I remembered the recommendation.  What a hoot!  We were sitting there watching it over and over, and everyone in my family from age 14 to 74 enjoyed it.  My only complaint is the over use of mild profanity, mainly taking the Lord's name in vain.  They should have left that out.  Otherwise, it was the wierdest, nuttiest, funniest, most touching, and yet suspenseful movie I have seen in a long time.  Must see (and hear).

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A19123D9G66E0O	Tim	"This story is built around the ""Odyssey"" by Homer, and although the following of it is very loose it does not take away from the fact that this is a great film. I would hope you have some idea of what the ""Odyssey"" was like, but if you don't this movie is about a man's journey to return to his home. It is filled with adventure and in the case of ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" lots of modern day comedy. I would say it doesn't offer too much for children, and does have some light violence (animal killing and guns) and some occasional swearing. This is why it is rated PG-13Overall the movie is very entertaining and I enjoyed it back when it was first released and I was 15-16, and the most recent time I watched it which was last night."	5.0	Great Remake of an Old Tale	2012-05-17	0	0	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A79Y9MC6OD8UO	Timothy Cade	This movie is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DID NOT WATCH THE DVD FEATURES, the story is the THREE STOOGES on HOMER'S ODYSSEY. It has nothing to do with yellow brick roads and wizards of oz and all that CRUD. Even though the Cohen Brothers never read the story, obviously some reviewers have not either, because if you had, you would know that it follows The Odyssey almost to a tee. In Cyclops' first scene in the book, he kills one of Ulysis' friends (squishing the frog they thought was their friend). And in their second encounter with the Cyclops they defeated him and his village of other Cyclopses (The KKK) and saved their friends who were captured the first time (in the book of course, Tommy wasnt there the first time they met Cyclops in the movie. Then there are the girls at the river they MOST OBVIOUSLY AS HECK REFERED TO AS SIRENS. In the book the sirens lewered the men from a boat and got some of them killed. There are also dozens of other mythological figures that come into play, but none of them turn out to be from Munchkin Land. All in all it was an awesome movie with wonderful music, I even bought the soundtrack today.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2J0VNTQTQO4R4	ToonForever	"I'm a big fan of the Coen Bros., including Raising Arizona, and esp. Fargo, so I was expecting to enjoy this.What I was not expecting was that I would be absolutely enraptured by it.  I was so enveloped by the sense of place, the razor sharp acting, the constant self-inflicted misfortune, and especially the music.  The music!  What a stunning, skillfully rendered and executed soundtrack.  I didn't realize what I was missing all these years, ignoring bluegrass the way I did.Well, back to the movie.I don't have to repeat all about the movie being based on Homer's Odyssey... oops, just did.  Well, that aside, I spent some time thinking about what touched me and made this so enjoyable, more than nearly every other movie I've ever seen.  I found many things.Of course, the casting is delightful.  Where do you find people who can pull off Clooney's sidekicks the way they did.  If I met John Turturro or Tim Blake Nelson on the street, I would probably be just shocked to find they aren't doltish hillbillies!  John Goodman is a perfect cyclops, in a goofy, ominous, hulkish way, and Christ Thomas King, who I believe is really known for his guitar playing, still plays the understated Tommy Johnson beautifully, as if it makes perfect sense to meet the devil at a crossroads in the middle of nowhere and sell your soul to him for a good dose of guitar skill.  I could go on and on about the cast, but you won't find a sour note in there.  You'll be convinced that none of these people could live anywhere but the Depression ear South.  Before I move on from the cast, something that goes unmentioned a lot, is the brilliant performances by some of the bit players, such as Frank Collison as Wash Hogwallop, Stephen Root as the Radio Station guy, and Millford Fortenberry as the Geographical Oddity storekeeper.  It may seem easy to do a small part for a little time, but this really underscores the Coen Bros. talent for getting a pitch perfect performance from every actor, no matter how small the part.Much has been made of the music... and rightly so!  I suppose it was less than surprising to learn that the music was actually a large part of the genesis of this movie.  You could almost say that this is a musical of sorts, not of the broadway style, but some sort of hybrid, as only the Coen Bros. can do.  My favorite musical moments are probably nearly the same as everyone else's, such as Man of Constant Sorrow.  How can you not just love that song?  The Sirens singing Didnt' Leave Nobody But the Baby with the way they used those rags for their loose-boned and sultry rhythm would certainly be tough to resist :)  O Death at a KKK rally, what a sendup that was!  The horrifying ridiculousness of that strangely choreographed scene was reminiscent of everything from the Nazi's Nuremberg rally to the Wicked Witch's guards from the Wizard of Oz (tell me you don't hear an echo of their ""Oh we love--Noooo one"" at the beginning of that scene.)  But I have to admit I was strangely moved and affected by my favorite scene, Down in the River to Pray, the baptism scene.  There was something beautiful, serene, and noble about those people in white, moving toward a turning point of purity and devotion down to be immersed in their new life.  I loved it, utterly.You may have noticed by this time that I haven't really mentioned Clooney but in passing.  There's a reason for that.  Probably the one thing that most deeply moved me was the character of Ulysses Everett McGill.  Though it's not obvious at first, I think Everett is a beautifully developed, complex character.  As the movie went on, I began to see him as insecure, loaded with good intentions, but without the inner strength to carry them out, full of regrets, yet a slave to his own passions and his desire to be admired.  When we begin to realize that what Everett's looking for is to get his wife back, the whole situation seems just delightfully silly at first.  But underneath, Clooney manages to display McGill's sensitive and wounded heart.  He's terribly insecure and masks his insecurity with too much talk and a know-it-all attitude, as well as his addiction to Dapper Dan and his own appearance.  A very telling scene is in the Geographical Oddity shop, when he obviously wants to tell off the shopkeeper who can't get his car part or his Dapper Dan for two weeks.  He's mad and looks to storm out, but instead he crumbles and buys the pomade and hair nets.  I think a lot of people miss that one.  Everett is lost in a mess of his own making and is desperate to find that one rope strong enough to pull him out of the hole he's in.  I think we all know people, or have one time *been* people who have become mired in their poor decisions and are further derailed by their attempts to circumvent the consequences.  When people like this get that one opportunity to escape their pattern of failure they often miss it, but once in a while they grab hold and make it.  I'll let you see what really happens in the movie, but George Clooney and the Coen Bros. have wrought a beautiful, tragically flawed, yet good and loving at heart protagonist and should be long recognized for it.I cannot recommend this movie enough, aside from what I've mentioned, it is loaded with fun and frolic, good and evil and the strange, enormous grey area in between, tragedy and triumph.  Some of the lines and gags in this movie are priceless and the sort of thing you find yourself saying to friends at odd times just to crack things up (Do - Not - Seek - the Treasssure!)  It bears multiple watchings well, as there are so many little details to pick up on, and its fun to find the direct Odyssey references within, some of them less obvious than others.I'm not sure it's ever been so easy to give a movie five stars."	5.0	Come on in, Boys, the Water is Fine...	2006-01-28	104	100	4

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	"Only the Coen Brothers could loosely base a film on THE ODYSSEY, set it in rural 1930s Mississippi, change the lead character from a war hero to an escaped chain-gang convict, and make the movie work successfully. The plot of the movie is that Ulysses ""Everett"" McGill, Pete, and Delmar are three convicts, chained together, who have escaped and are on the run to supposedly fine some loot (1.2 million dollars to be exact) that ""Everett"" buried before he was put in the pen. Along the way they meet a variety of characters from a blind railroad man, a one-eyed Bible salesman, three beautiful sirens washing clothes in the river, and George ""Babyface"" Nelson. Throw in a Klu Klux Klan meeting that starts off in a rousing musical number that seems a cross between a Broadway musical and the flying monkey theme from THE WIZARD OF OZ; a couple of lynch mobs; back-stabbing family members; a prayed for miracle flood of Biblical proportions; and a strange character who seems a lot like the devil and you're in for a toe-stomping, roller coaster ride of a movie filled with humor of all kinds.Many people have criticized the movie because they don't understand what's going on throughout the movie. To begin with, the film is loosely based on Homer's THE ODYSSEY. If you're familiar with that classic piece of literature, you will have a better understanding of the movie and perhaps appreciate it a bit more. But if you aren't familiar with THE ODYSSEY, it really shouldn't make too much of a difference. This is a Coen brother's film and like all of their movies it is quirky, somewhat bizarre, and full of classical and pop cultural references. The humor is on several different levels from visual gags to witty word play.However, not everyone will find the film enjoyable. Nevertheless, this is probably the most audience accessible of all Coen films. It's made in the same sort of style as RAISING ARIZONA and THE HUDSUCKER PROXY and has a ""happy"" ending. The film feels like one is watching an old silent film brought to life and connected together. Not only that, but the movie also has one of the best soundtracks in recent years; the music is a key part of the film.Other than that all I can say is that my brother and I are different as night and day and there aren't very many movies we both enjoy.

Many people refer to the Homer's ""The Odyssey"" as the main filmic reference this movie. While that is true to a large extent, ""O Brother..."" is also an homage to Americana. And it's not only the music. From references to Busby Berkeley (the men on the chain gang as the movie opens move in syncopated rhythm like the swimmers and dancer of the early Berkely films), to the ""Wizard of Oz,""  Chris Thomas King's ""Robert Johnson-like"" character who sold his soul to the devil at the cross-roads to learn to play guitar, to the James Agee and Walker Evans Depression Era photography, ""O Brother..."" is a gorgeous culmination of over 100 years of American filmmaking."	5.0	Pinnacle of the Coen Brothers' career	2008-04-09	3	3	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2UK7F1U7SDP5N	"V. A. Tyler ""CoyoteDancer"""	When the Ku Klux Klan was marching at their ceremony, did anyone get a hit of the Wizard of Oz? I swear, I kept waiting to hear &quot;OH HE HO, YO-HO.&quot; It seemed just like that scene in front of the wicked witch's castle, where the guardsmen are marching around, and then march into the castle, where the good guys sneak in, to rescue Dorothy. Only here, they're rescuing Tommy Johnson.Anyway, it is no way lessened my enjoyment of this movie. I find these guys to be incredibly clever and rather sweet-natured with their products. Plenty of laughs at the foibles of humans, but not ill-natured ones. Besides, I'd pay good money just to watch that one scene of John Turturro dancing onstage while they sing &quot;He's in the Jailhouse Now.&quot; Absolutely classic!	5.0	Did any one else feel like this?	2002-01-07	1	1	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A22KH1SE5T0YOY	Vijay Devarajan	For those of you who complained about this movie, you obviosly have never read the Odyssey, by Homer, upon which this movie was loosely based. For me, being quite familiar with the story, &quot;O Brother&quot; came alive. Those scenes that &quot;dont help the plot along&quot; are actually cleverly inserted parallels to stories contained in the Odyssey. For example, the Sirens, the Cyclops, Ulysses' decent into hell, and fighting against his wife's suitors. Nearly every scene had a clever parallel, which made this movie more enjoyable ten-fold. Add the ingenuity with a genuinely funny screen-play and a stand-out performance by George Clooney, and you got yourself a winner.

A18758S1PUYIDT	Viva	"I mean ""milder"" in the sense that it's not nearly as violent or profane as some of their other work--not that I necessarily have a problem with either of the latter as long as it's necessary to the story. That's all.Anyway...Apparently, the brothers based this screenplay on Homer's The Odyssey, and that makes me wish I had actually read it because then I would have a fuller understanding of what's going on.Still, I enjoyed the weirdness and unexpected events--the sirens in the water, the one-eyed con man, the little girls singing, the sudden baptism, the camaraderie and chemistry among the three escaped convicts, and the climactic flood.Minor quibbles:  Holly Hunter's role is so small that many other women could have played it; I'm not sure why George Nelson had to be in the film at all; I don't know if Klansmen really march around in formation and sing the way they do in the film; I remain in mystery as to the fates of Delmer and Pete at the end.Quibbles aside, if you are a fan of the Coens, you will enjoy this odd, unpredictable, quirky tale."	4.0	An entertaining, milder Coen Bros. film	2008-05-06	2	1	1

Very roughly based on events in Homer's ""Odyssey,"" this is a tale of three convicts who escape from a chain-gang in the 1930s. Their adventures are crazy, but insightful into the south during the Depression.There are actually a lot of elements from the ""Odyssey."" The convicts meet three ""sirens."" A man running for governor has the first name of ""Homer,"" another man is blind in one eye, and in the end, the men wind up in a courthouse where ""Ulysses"" metaphorically slays the ""suitor"" of his wife.In their over-the-top journey to find a stash of robbery money, they are involved in one incident after another that perfectly catches the spirit of America during the Depression.The music is wonderful, and the songs and comedy will stay with you forever--""Man of Constant Sorrow"" and ""Let's Meet at the River to Pray"" to mention two of the wonderful songs.I've watched in many times.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A39Z2M0O2K3XY2	Warlen Bassham	I rented it first, just to see what all the hullaballoo was about.  Now I'm buying it.You don't have to love the Coen Brothers to love this movie, although it wouldn't hurt.  Anyone familiar with the 'exploding man' in Raising Arizona or the 'evil woodgrinder' in Fargo will realize that there has to be *something* twisted coming in this one.  When it does come, it's pretty tame, but by then you're hooked.It's hard to find any fault.  Clooney is perfect as the loquacious and fussy Ulysses.  Goodman ditto as Cyclops.  Durning ditto as the slummin' southern governor.  Holly Hunter as Penelope doesn't get much screen time, but she makes the most of what she does get.  And then of course there's the music, which is just too good to be true.The only thing that bothered me at all was that the brothers didn't 'bring me along gently' into the style of this particular story.  In Fargo, you don't realize what you're in for till it's too late.  In Raising Arizona the plot has you hooked early enough so you have to put up with the gore.  There's no similar 'upward path' in this.  Bang, five minutes into it, there's Clooney spouting his effortless and greasy brand of codswallop, and I found myself going &quot;This is supposed to be FUNNY?&quot;Well, yeah, it was, and in fact, once you get used to it, it IS.  In fact, I haven't laughed this loud or this long since SLEEPER.  By the end I was so wound up in the Coen's brand of madcap humor that even the swimming dog scene put me into stitches.  Even such an unlikely subject as a roll-top desk turns out to be a screamer.You HAVE to see it!	5.0	Took A While, but Now I Love It	2002-08-26	4	4	0

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1HMHA19BL5HQS	William T. Sawyer	One of the most enjoyable movies I've seen - funny, uplifting, thought-provoking.  But, you must have familiarity with The Odyssey, and DEFINITELY have an understanding of the Depression-era rural south, and southern culture in general, in order to appreciate the rich and subtle substance of the film.  If you don't, watching this movie is a poor use of your time.  In direct contradiction to comments from some who apparently fail to meet these criteria: the music is simply marvelous (again, if you enjoy the harmonies and lyrics of bluegrass and folk music), the dialogue (particulary Clooney's part) is witty, and the stereotypes (and allusions to other films) are both necessary and delicious, and clever as well. This is most certainly not a racist film and the point is NOT the 'plot'. Yes, there are a few rough spots and historical inaccuracies. But, they are trivial. This movie is an testament to the talent of the Coens, and far better than Fargo, which had a dark and bizarre side!	5.0	Outstanding!!! (IF you understand the American south)	2001-06-24	1	1	0
B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2VJCYKSTCKJNZ	"Willow Polson ""writer and whatnot."""	This is definitely one of the best films of 2000 and what's not to like? Both goofball and sophisticated humor, visually stunning, simplistic on the surface while being complex underneath, it's a delight for the senses and a thinking person's film despite the seemingly dopey subject matter and main characters.It's a very loose retelling of Homer's Odyssey set in the American deep south during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The three main characters are escaped convicts, and their adventures will keep you entertained throughout the film and wanting more. The acting is right on the money and not overdone (which it could have easily slipped into considering the subject matter). A quote from aint-it-cool-news.com sums it up well, &quot;George Clooney will never again be this cool in a film.&quot;I immediately went out and bought the soundtrack, which, if you enjoy the roots of American music like I do, is a great selection of &quot;mountain music&quot; and blues songs as well as soundtrack elements done in a slightly more modern style.This film has so much going for it.

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A2QK0CLGM4Q0R3	"yarden ""yarden"""	The Coen brothers have a cult following, but until I saw this movie, I didn't count myself among the masses that love the Coens.  However, with this movie, this brother team has cemented their reputation as serious and skilled filmmakers with a lot to say and a stylish way of saying it.This movie is a loose retelling of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; by Homer, set in the Depression-era Deep South.  George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson make an unlikely team of escaped convicts who embark on a journey of the weird and wonderful.  Watch for the appearance of many famous Odyssey allusions, such as the Sirens and the Cyclops (among others).  The Coens' quirky take on this classic tale is delightful and perfectly executed, and the script is beautifully and humorously written.  The sets and filming are artistic and a bit mythical, and the casting choices are just great.  The film is peopled with interesting characters, in classic Coen brothers fashion.  Look for great supporting characters played by John Goodman, Holly Hunter, Charles Durning, and others.And that's not all!  Interwoven in this film are great depression-era songs and some original songs, with excellent music direction by T-bone Burnett.  Who says Moulin Rouge is the first movie in a long while to take the musical format?  This movie is just as much a musical as Baz Luhrmann's much-hyped movie.I really believe that this movie reaches heights that previous Coen brothers movies (even Fargo) haven't reached.  In addition, I believe this movie was slighted by the Academy during Oscar time.  This movie was one of the best films of the year, and excelled in every aspect a film can be awarded for.	5.0	A triumph of a movie, thoroughly enjoyable	2001-06-04	119	104	15

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1TOML01ZYPUFR	"Zachary S. Houp ""RAREfiend"""	This is a rare opportunity, to review a film so entirely enjoyable,  so entertaining beyond my wildest imaginations, funnier than I could have possible expected, yet still without living up to the potential that it undoubtedly possessed.  I've heard--whether or not it is true, I don't know--that the Coen brothers prided themselves on the fact that &quot;this is their interpretation of the Odyssey without ever having actually read it.&quot;  I'm inclined to believe that if they actually HAD read it, they could have constructed a far more diverse spoof that covered some of the more absurd and interesting adventures of Homer's tale.  But, regardless, whether they did or not I cannot say anything but that this film is one of the most entertaining I've ever had the pleasure to witness.And thus, this film becomes somewhat of a paradox, because there is a lot for me to criticize.  Admittedly, Homer doesn't follow an ongoing plot too closely; he seemed content to get his hero home and with his wife.  The Coen brothers, however, take this neglegable attention to plot to an even greater extent however, as it follows more traditional road trip, buddy comedies by interspersed adventures that have relatively no bearing on future events or occurances.  I have to imagine that they could have weaved a much more integrated tale, combining their elements more comprehensively into a geniune story--or at least something resembling it.  For this reason, by the film's conclusion I find myself somewhat unsatisfied, as I know the potential was always there, but never executed to the degree that such a promising idea should have been.But still, beyond that, I was entertained.  As is expected from the Coen brothers, they somehow dredge of the greatest characters ever to grace the screen: always just craziest enough to represent some guy that you know.  The acting is superb, especially leads George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro.  Meanwhile, as the stories &quot;plot&quot; takes our protagonists from hilarious situation to hilarious situation, the film just keeps getting funnier and funnier, entertaining in new and obscure ways that one might have never thought imaginable.So, to summarize this film, it is perhaps the funniest and most entertaining movie that ever succeeded despite its blatently apparent lack of overall cohesion.  If you can overlook something negligable like cosistancy--as I most certainly did--then you will no doubt learn to love this film for all of its humorous situations, idiosyncratic characters, and--yes--even its faults: indeed they are big, but of little consequence when you find yourself so wholly enjoying the film before you.  I'll admittedly leave off with the comment that this isn't the Coen brothers' best, but even after adding it to their repotoire, cannot be deemed in any way &quot;bad.&quot;  They are two of the greatest filmmakers in Hollywood, and if this movie can prove that even one of their lesser pictures still exceeds almost everything else offered, then it stands as a testament to their ability and genius.	4.0	Funny, Funny, Pointless, and Funny	2001-12-07	6	4	2

B00003CXRM	O Brother, Where Art Thou?	A1JLMQRXW1LA74	Zan Gillies	I haven't seen a Coen Brothers movie that I didn't like. This movie is no exception. &quot;O Brother&quot; has everything: Comedy, Action, and great music. It's based loosely on Homer's Odyssey, taking some of the character traits and situations from that and putting them into a more modern scenario. For example, turning Tiresias the prophet into an old blind African American Railroad worker, or Polyphemus the Cyclops into a con man/Bible salesman with an eye-patch. The movie is full of humor that anyone would love. I'm fourteen and I loved it, my sister, an eighteen year old, loved it, and both of my parents loved it. If you liked this movie, I also recommend &quot;Raising Arizona,&quot; &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy,&quot; and almost any other Coen Brothers movie. Some of their movies like &quot;Fargo&quot; and &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; have a different kind of humor, but they are still funny. If you haven't seen this movie, it's well worth buying. You'll want to watch it over and over again.	5.0	The Coen Brothers Strike Gold Again!	2001-07-24	9	8	1
