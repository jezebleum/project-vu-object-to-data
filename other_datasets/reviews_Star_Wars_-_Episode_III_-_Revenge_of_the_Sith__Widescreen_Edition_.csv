B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3A1OA237FOZFK	#1 Amazon Fan	For any true Star Wars fan, I don't think this movie will disappoint. There are some interesting discrepencies or misnomers that don't completely jive with the latter 3 movies, mostly due to the order in which they were made and the technology available.  It sure seems like R2D2 can do so much more than he can later, for instance.Overall, I really liked the movie and the effects and soundtrack are absolutely superb.  However, you should take pause before allowing someone 12 or younger to watch it.  I realize that this should be a given based on other reviews and the movie's rating, but our 8 year old is a Star Wars fanatic.  I read all of the reviews about the darkness of this movie when it hit the theaters and how particular scenes could be very disturbing to a younger audience (most seemed to emphasize the killing of the Jedi children).  We decided to let our 8 year old watch it with us anyway, and oddly enough the scene that really flipped him out was when Chancellor Palpatine fought Windu and turned red-eyed and hideous looking during the fight.He did not watch the rest of it, and I do believe as Anakin turned to the dark side and became red-eyed and downright evil, it would have been even worse.  He really liked Anakin and it would have been too much for him to absorb and understand.Take this review for what it's worth, just thought I'd throw it in as it really helped me to read other's comments.	4.0	Absolute for any SW fan, but not for younger audience	2005-11-19	2	1	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1ALOIPRR8Q06J	"2 cents ""meaningless memes"""	"NO. This movie did NOT succeed in salvaging the prequels from their legacy of disappointment, but rather merely demonstrated what may have been - what COULD have been.In the end you can feel sympathy with Darth Vader's howl, ""NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!"".So, oh well. Lucas blew it.Was 3 better than 1 and 2? Sure it was. Better than Jedi? Arguably. I'd say in some ways better. Does it being better than these colossal disappointments make it a great film? Nope.It's all been already said a million times, but the moral of the story of Star Wars is that to tell a great story you have to be a great story teller.George Lucas had a great vision but couldn't realize it. He is like George Bush in that he clearly got in way over his head. Shoulda let Spielberg direct and talented writers help out way more with those awful scripts. He created his own lame a$$ ""Empire"" which he became victim of in a way."	4.0	Redemption?	2008-03-14	4	2	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3HS5U2UUSQP0N	"&#34; Anti Microchip &#34; ""Jesus Christ can ..."	"Yes Revenge of the Sith has its flaws as do all the Star Wars films. First, unlike some I think the acting is subpar in this film, the dialogue is anything but perfect, and at times it seems forced. Why do I give it four stars? Because what it does well makes everything else easily forgiven.First, the evil Darth Sidius is the best part of this movie. He clearly is the villan that has started the clone war, is manipulating the war from both sides, and (at least for me) perfectly portrays a politician who is hungry for power. Anakin Skywalkers transformation into Vader for some is unbelievable, and I can see why one might have issues with it. However, it is how Darth Sidius manipulates Anakin into believing that he can save his love if he joins the dark side. Further, it is how Sidius manipulates Anakin into believing that he truly is the benevolent one that is probably the most compelling performance of the film.I found things in this film that can reflect real life which is probably why I enjoyed it so much. First, you have a crooked politician who started the war and is running/leading it from both sides. Second, This same politician (darth sidius) easily manipulates the populace and in the end has them cheering for their own enslavement. Plus I found Darth Sidius very compelling when he stated, ""Execute order 66"" to have the republic army (who the Jedi were working for) murder the Jedi. He than had Darth Vader kill the Viceroy who were helping Sidius run the droid army on the other side. Just like crule dictators like Stalin or Hitler, Sidius murders those that helped him rise to power. The scene where the lead viceroy of the droid army looks at vader and says, ""but Darth Sidius promised us peace"" only to have Vader slice him in half with his light saber immediately after makes one think. One has to wonder if Lucus took history as a blue print for this film."	4.0	Better than most give it credit for.	2010-07-13	5	4	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2ICVNCPSTI1CS	400 Spurs in Brain	Unlike many, I still appreciate Episodes I and II despite their faults.  They present a nice contrast to, but also effectively set up the original trilogy.  Compared to the past two movies, however, this movie is a triumph.  Of course, the FX are great (the space battle over Corusant, and Obiwans altercation with General Grevious), but this movie has more soul to it than the past two.  Finally there is a sense of actually caring about the characters, which was somewhat absent from the first two.  A New Hope effectively set up the characters in one film, but this trilogy took 2 movies to do the same thing.  Nevertheless, Episode III is surprisingly more emotional than any of the previous films- even Empire.  Perhaps the best part of this film is Palpatine's manipulation of Anakin and his convincing turn to the dark side.  This, with very good dialogue, was done way more effectively than Episode II which had a completely fake evolution of Padme and Anakins relationship.  This movie is very surprising, in just how dark it is.  It certainly makes the lighter hearted A New Hope a fitting sequel.  In all, the film does a great job at tying the saga together and adds to the substance and importance of events in the original trilogy.  There are some short comings, like Padme's uneffective role and expected terrible dialogue, but the movie is far better than the previous two and is a proper keystone in the saga.	4.0	Finally, the Star Wars we've been looking for....	2005-09-26	2	1	1

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AV2KX7UVT8O6Z	A. amstadter	"And thankfully we as a audience get to enjoy every minute of this theatrical release. From the beginning the movie starts out with a great flying battle sequence that's only a temptation for what lies ahead, and it isn't long in the movie where it wins it's new pg-13 rating.Yes this movie is very violent, not like kill bill blood splattered every possible place violent, but more violent then let's say the first trilogy. Though not alot of the violence is shown, it's always hinted at. It's like lucus watched a bunch of horror movies that were more psychologically suspenceful than your normal movie in the genre. However don't let this fool you into thinking that there is no action scenes, there are plenty.The sound in this movie also comes through too, but then again it's star wars so that's pretty much a given. All of the sound effects come out sounding clear and the score is still at the top of the genre. The only problem that I had during the movie (and most of the prequils) is that alot of the saber fights have music in them, now this may not effect the normal fans of the movies, but the hard core fans will notice this and may or may not be mad at this change since the original films were just the sounds of the sabers.The acting and the script are kinda good but for a starwars movie the script is one of the best out there. The way some events happen in the movie comes off really well since we know what's going to happen, but somehow not knowing how it all happened. Thankfully lucus uses this to his advantage and exploits it as much as possible. For the most part the acting is decent too, every one plays there roles right and you can really belive them... except for Hayden Christensen. Hayden... Hayden just can't act! But besides Hayden everything is good acting wise. And while were on the subject of problems in acting and the script I also didn't like how Anakin becomes who he is eventually supose to become, it was like here I just killed the only people who know the truth come to the darkside. And I really disliked how they addressed children as ""youngins"". Come on youngins? That just sounds stupid!Maybe they should've covered the youngins up with more special effects since that came off better than that line. The special effects in this movie for me were a little bit of a let down since I've seen spider man and the movie did come out just right after e3. But for the most part the special effects are still pretty good, it's just that alot of the backround effects and yoda were better than other things like star ships.All in all it's a most see, however I would like to reccomend not bringing in children during the movie cause it's really intence and just children shouting out things during the movie takes people out of the mood it generates. Not for ages under 8 but still good none the less."	4.0	hey george lucas decided to actually make a movie this time!	2005-05-31	10	4	6

Without these elements this movie wouldn't be the ridiculous montage of clich&eacute;s I regrettably saw last weekend.Outside of the predicable plot, obnoxious characters and horrifying costume design, I couldn't help but wonder if they actually filmed any of this movie. It looks like they just threw in cheesy 3D backgrounds from Myst. Not in just a few of the scenes, but throughout the entire movie. In fact, what you see here is not Star Wars Episode III; it is actually a 3 hour commercial for the Star Wars Episode III X-box video game.I also find it hard to believe that in this futuristic wonderland they have mastered the art of stylized android warriors but fail to produce effective birth control.In short, this movie is the equivalent of a computer animated sci-fi version of the Christian soap opera Passions. I was horrified to read such enthusiastic reviews but I shouldn't be so surprised because this movie is obviously about making money and I guess most journalists are too.Drink Pepsi One"	1.0	"""I saw him on a security hologram killing younglings"""	2005-05-28	41	26	15

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3DGB4HN3QCGAL	A. Burchfield	I bought it because I've got all 5 of the other Star Wars movies on DVD and wanted to finish my collection. Considering we've basically known the story for the last 20+ years Episode III did a good job of finishing the prequel series of showing how it all began.I must admit to being somewhat depressed over the story but there were a lot of good bits in it. Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor were better than Hayden Christensen but that would be easy enough considering his role (I did think his turning to the dark side went too fast). The scene I liked the least in the whole movie was the battle between Obi-Wan and Annakin on that Lava world, the heat (and likely unbreathable atmosphere)would make that impossible.I noticed a solid stream of special effects and computer generated scenery, so much of it that I suspect some must've been there just because they could do it. I think I've always liked such things in the Star Wars movies, that and the great set design work.Anthony Daniels (C-3PO) and Kenny Baker (R2-D2) are in the whole movie (and all 6 movies). Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca)I think was in only one scene on the Wookiee planet, hardly worth putting on the costume for but a nice touch.The extras weren't too bad except that the photo gallery has some would be interesting shots of things that seem to have been taken with a fisheye lens making it too hard to see anything. I noticed that the crew had a lot of fun taking some of these shots because more than a few show somebody horsing around. What might have been the most interesting picture was of the Naboo Queen in scene 48, Padme Amadala's funeral procession. She's Keisha Castle-Hughes who played Paikea in Whalerider.Not the greatest movie but still worth watching.	3.0	It was really all it could be, good end to the saga, some extras lacking	2005-11-16	1	0	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1NY8E3WRXPWCX	"A. Catalano ""Worlds Greatest"""	"I would compare the 3 Prequel films to rides in an amusement park. They are fun for those few minutes, but then later you realize that was silly.The ending was horrible. Or at least how it was written. So Vader just tried to kill padme, and he asks after being put in the Darth Suit ""Where's Padme""? He is told, you killed her. We hear the dumbest ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"", ever recorded on film.And the dialogue was garbage throughout all three prequels. As Harrison Ford once said "" George you might be able to right this crap on paper, but nobody would say that"".  Unfortunately, George was surrounded by Yes-men who would not tell him what horrible writing this was.Also, how many  CGI light saber battles were there. The Whole General Grievous character was too cartoonish.  They should cut him out the film, and worked on more character development.In Star Wars and Empire you actually care about Han and Leia. When Vader tortures Leia on the Death Star, the audience wants the rebeillion to win and dust the Death Star. When Han is put in Carbonite in Empire, you feel general sorrow and look forward to the revenge in Return.In Revenge who does the audience feel for? I was honestly rooting for Anakin in the climax to the movie, because everyone (Yoda, Obi Wan, Mace) are a bunch of clueless knobs who couldnt figure out the Emperor was the Devil. Have some Dagobah - Yoda for loosing to Palpatine when he already got a beatdown from Mace 20 mins before.Speilberg claimed in Cried at the end of ROTS. I cried during Schindler's List and ET.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2O8RIDCJ0H83V	Acoma	"Episode III wraps up George Lucas's epic space opera. Out of all the prequel movies Episode III is by far the best of the three. My only big complaint for tying up all the loose ends is that Jar Jar Binks did not meet a grisly fate at the hands of a Clone Trooper or Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber.In my opinion, there didn't need to be three movies. They could have told the entire story in one movie. Nobody really cared what Anakin was like when he was a little kid working in a shop in Tatooine and dear lord, could we have please picked another planet? There are thousands of worlds but somehow Tatooine, a backwater planet, is at the forefront of all the major happenings in this galaxy. If there is a bright center of the Universe then Tatooine is the planet farthest from? Could have fooled me. In the prequel movies I would have assumed it was a moon off of Coruscant.Episode III mostly delivers what Star Wars fans were aching for. We see Darth Vader on screen for the first time, but even that was ruined with his Luke Skywalkeresque ""Noooooooooo"" when he asks Padme's fate. I wanted to throw my popcorn at the screen, but sensibility prevented me...well, and the fact I paid five bucks for it.Rated Episode III as 3 stars mainly because dismissing the plot there is a lot of action sequences which were enjoyable to watch. The lightsaber duels and the huge space battle were really fun. Knocked off two stars mainly because of the incredibly craptastic acting by Hayden Christianson. I hope I never have to see him onscreen anywhere and he is subjected to living out the remainding years of his life at Sci-Fi conventions signing copies of collector edition DVDs. Maybe him and Jake Lloyd can team up for a buddy film.The thing with Episode III and indeed all the prequel movies which just didn't have the feel of Episode IV through VI was the actor chemistry. It was basically an ensemble cast with a lot of big name talent in the lead roles. The thing that made the original movies work is George Lucas spent a lot of time seeing how the actors worked together with each other and looked. He realized a need for chemistry between everyone in the originals. It is blatently apparent there is little to none throughout all of the movies. The most critical element of plot for Episode III is the relationship between Anakin and Padme. I don't see any real relationship there and I don't think moviegoers seen it either. I could buy the vision that Anakin had about Padme dying in childbirth is somewhat plausible I suppose but the writing and acting did nothing to back it up. You can take a very ""out there"" plot element and make it believable if you write/act well. There was neither for this film.I've went off topic a bit outside of Episode III, but this is the completion of the saga. Does it accomplish this? Yes it wraps up nicely. However, the prequels were not even up to par with what Star Wars fans had come to love.Bottomline, is it worth your money? If you are a Star Wars fan like I am you will do the same thing I will...buy it. Despite it's failing it is the best of the three and the action sequences will justify my money."	3.0	Coming full circle...	2005-10-06	17	9	8

You ask a friend for goofy words to write in the blanks (""give me a color, a kind of animal, a form of transportation, and a place!"") You write what your friend says in the blanks and then read the zany story back to them in its entirety, with the words they've chosen in it, so you end up with something like : ""The purple elephant rode a skateboard and went to the library!"" and everyone laughs (well, if you're 8 years old).I'm sure Lucas spent most of his time writing ""Revenge of the Sith"" sitting by the pool with his assistant in situations like this:Assistant:""OK, Mr. Lucas, I need an animal, the name of something commonly found in a room or office, and a geographical feature!""Lucas:""Ummm, let me think a sec: 'lizard', 'a window', and 'a volcano'.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ALIBRR4PLLLX2	A Customer	George Lucas intended the prequel trilogy to be about Anakin, Amidala and Obi-wan.  In many ways it turned out to be Palpatine's trilogy, a Sith trilogy.At the beginning Sidious had staged his own capture.  Let the Separatists believe they had captured Chancellor Palpatine.  Only Dooku knew that Sidious and Palpatine were the same man.  Not even Grievous knew the truth.Anakin and Obi-wan were sent to rescue the Chancellor.  As far as Dooku knew the plan was for him to kill Obi-wan and then stage his own capture by Anakin.  He believed that the plan was for him push Anakin to the edge of the dark side and for his grief over Obi-wan to push him over the edge.Sidious watched as the 3 of them dueled.  Obi-wan thrown across the room and knocked cold.  Then Dooku did indeed push Anakin.  The result was Dooku loosing both his hands, and being at Anakins mercy.Laughing with delight Palpatine commanded Anakin to kill Dooku.  Sidious watched as Dooku realized, in the few seconds that Anakin hesitated, that he'd never really been the Sith Apprentice - realized he'd just been temporarily holding that place.  Then Sidious's chosen apprentice decapitated him.Anakin then freed the Chancellor, then went to revive Obi-wan.  Palpatine commanded Anakin to leave him behind while the 2 of them escaped, he refused.  Killing Dooku had made Anakin vulnerable to the Dark Side, but not enough - not yet.Sidious's next step was to send Obi-wan to battle Grievous. He knew that Anakin had recently had a vision of Amidala's death and that only Obi-wan's influence could keep Anakin's attachment to her under control.  With Obi-wan absent Palpatine revealed who and what he really was to Anakin.Anakin didn't immediately accept the offer of becoming the Sith Apprentice, even with Sidious's promise that he had the power to protect Amidala.  Anakin revealed Palpatine's true identity to the Jedi.  Who immediately went to arrest Palpatine.  Which was exactly what he wanted.Sidious dueled several Jedi and killed most.  However Master Windu reflected Sidious's own Sith lightning back at him.  How and why Sidious's face changed during that battle is unclear, perhaps even he didn't fully understand it.  Whatever the reason his face became corrupted, a manifestation of his inner darkness.The duel got Sidious what he wanted.  By trying to arrest the legal Chancellor the Jedi technically became traitors. Also  Anakin had finally given into the Darkness that had been swelling in him since he'd murdered Dooku, together he and Sidious killed Windu.  Immediately afterward Sidious renamed his new apprentice Darth Vader.Order 66 was just one of many contingency plans the clone troopers had been trained with.  It was hidden among so many others, unnoticed.  With the Jedi legally traitors Palpatine was free to issue order 66.  That had always been the point of the clone wars.  Because the clone troops would take the Jedi completely by surprise.  All over the galaxy thousands of Jedi perished, almost at once.An assault on the Jedi temple was lead by Vader, on Sidious's order.  Afterwards Sidious sent Vader to kill the Separatist leaders - to officially end the clone wars.Palpatine already controlled the senate.  In essence he'd been an emperor for some time.  With the Jedi dead he simply declared that officially true.  Democracy died with Thunderous applause, and an empire was born.Afterward Yoda came to kill Sidious.  The Jedi Grand Master and the Sith Master dueled in the Senate -in the very heart of what Palpatine had spend his life trying to destroy.  They were deciding the fate of the galaxy right there. They'd become the embodiment of the Force, they were Light vs. Darkness, winner take all.  Sidious proved stronger.Once Yoda was defeated, once Sidious was no longer in immediate danger, he quickly sensed that Lord Vader was in mortal danger - and went to save him.For all his power and knowledge not even Sidious had been prepared for Vader's defeat on Mustafar.  Was dismayed to find Vader dismembered and horribly burned.Some Force users believe the loss of so much of his body would weaken his Force connection, others believe it would only limit the ways he could express that power.  Either way artificial hands and legs would prevent him from casting lightning, and leaping about as the Jedi often did.  Vader would be physically maimed and his power restricted.Even with all that Sidious  believed Vader would still be stronger than any other. His surgeon droids replaced limbs with prosthetics and sealed Vader in a life support suit.  Vader would be imprisoned in the suit for the rest of his years.Then Sidious informed Vader of his wife's death.  Leaving Vader with nothing but the Dark Side and his Master.  Sidious believed beyond any doubt that Anakin was dead and only Vader remained.At the end Sidious and Vader were looking at the skeletal structure of a, still unnamed, moon sized space station.  A space station whose power core, internal structure, and primary weapon were still completely theoretical.  It would take nearly 2 decades to turn theory into application.Sidious's plans were complete.  The Jedi order was destroyed and republic was no more.  His apprentice was his at last - even if Vader wasn't precisely what he'd bargained for originally.  The galaxy was his to rule as he saw fit.But there were a few things Sidious was unaware of.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1D5WQXFHTTICB	A Customer	Sith (SW III) provides Star Wars fans with the long awaited story of how Anakin (played by Hayden Christensen) turns to the dark side and aids in the Jedi purge.While the movie is full of dazzling special effects, the dialogue is lacking for most characters.  Windu, Palpatine and Yoda are distinguished exceptions to this. Ian McDiarmid plays a compelling and sly performance as the Chancellor as the plot unfolds. The lightsaber duels and battle sequences are powerful and give the viewer a strong sense of involvement.  The battle between Obi-Won (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin is arguably the highlight of the film and ranks against the duel between Darth Maul and Obi-Won (Episode I).A notable failure comes with Lucas and love scenes. Natalie Portman's (as Padme) capabilities as an actress were not used in this film.Altogether, this movie does far better than its prequel predecessors and ranks wholly on par with Empire from the original trilogy. Unlike the previous prequel movies, this movie captives and compels attention to the sequences. In addition, the movie is considerably darker, and parents are well advised to prepare children prior to viewing it. This is not a typical cuddly feel-good Star Wars film.[...]	4.0	Overall, an intense and great movie.	2005-09-14	7	5	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3JXOXKWOIETIY	"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse"""	"Star Wars III, Revenge of the Sith has the best Special Effects I've ever seen.  The backgrounds are made infinitely intricate with computer graphics, so see it on a big screen if possible.For those who've followed the other episodes, this one is about Anakin up to the point he becomes Darth Vader (Haiden Christensen).  Anakin and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are Jedis until the Chancellor induces Anakin with the Dark Side and pits him against Obi-Wan.  The script writes itself and anyone who's seen the original will know beforehand the film's conclusion, however the conclusion is still moving as the 6 film series comes full circle.Some interesting political jibes are thrown in by Lucas, such as when Anakin says, ""You're either for me or you're my enemy.""Obi-Wan replies, ""Only Sith speaks in absolutes!""  That the film premiered at Cannes in France is not accidental and Lucas said, ""I hope people see the relevance of this film"".The original which I saw premiered as a kid is still the best in my book; though 1977s technology limited the FXs it was a fresh new film with a great John Williams/London Philharmonic soundtrack.  A couple things about this one:  Luke and Leah were said to be siblings, not twins, in Return of the Jedi.  Also I know the sounds the fighters make are cool, but there is no sound in space.  But the effects are the reason to see this one as well as the mindblowing scenery that comes with them."	5.0	Best Special Effects Ever, good political allusions also	2005-05-23	5	1	4
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2UALOIFBDOI60	Adam Chen	"Perhaps the most emotionally jarring of all the sci-fi epics out there, Star Wars episode III is the most efficient use of lightsaber combat seen yet. I would rate the fights as top notch, save for the over-the-top acting potential that was reduced to excess lightsaber hits and other redundant lines, combining in a sort of waste that evil thrives on.I believe this work to be the finest of Lucas yet, finer than even that of Episode VI, V, or IV, because of its respect for the tendencies of evil to thrive unnoticed, and the fact that not once did I believe, while watching the film, that Jedi were in fact good, but all evil.This is a major change from the first three episodes released, and to say the least, I would consider a complete shift from Good to Evil and all-powerful to be a master director's most beautiful composition.I would highly recommend this to all kids and all adults. It's ""damned near impossible"" to justify violence from seeing this movie. The only thing you can do is scare young children, which should happen. That said, the number of people complaining about the violence has been nill. Or virtually nothing. This is powerful. The first movie ever to merely receive criticism, without review board criticism, or skeptical philandering of wanton individuals who need to get their heart put on paper. I would not reject such a movie ever, if it be such a life-threatening expose of a jurisdiction given to few souls with individuals attached for free.This is like saying that this movie is determined, not guaranteed, to teach you something about evil and how it's made up entirely of all good. Something like that deserves a round of applause. I would consider its value as a teaching mechanism better than 20 parents of today's average caliber. And if they read this, they would agree wholeheartedly."	5.0	Exciting and adventurous	2005-07-13	8	6	2

Despite a problematic plot, the movie lives up to the adrenaline rush that it was supposed to provide with its amazing imagery and special effects.What do I mean by ""problematic plot?""  Well, early in the movie Obi Wan and Anakin are each flying spaceships in the middle of a battle scene when they get attacked by small robot droids that grip on to their spaceships and proceed to start tearing them apart.  (The scene is reminiscent of William Shatner's classic Twilight Zone episode in which he sees a gremlin tearing apart the plane he is riding in.)  The problem is that you can't help wondering why Anakin and Obi Wan don't use ""the Force"" to simply flick the little droids off of their spaceships.It's also not very obvious why the Chancellor had himself kidnapped early in movie.  Was this an attempt to provoke a war between the Separatists and the Republic?And a third example of a problematic plot revolves around the central character of Anakin and his love interest Amidala.  Natalie Portman is one of the world's most beautiful women and she consistently provided the best acting performances throughout the trilogy.  The problem is that the ""love story"" itself could not come close to matching the classic Han and Leia story.  The princess falling in love with the ""scoundrel"" in episodes four through six was a far more powerful device for endearing the audience to the central characters.Overall, however, Revenge of the Sith is an excellent movie and one of the best sci-fi flicks of all time.Review by: Adam Platts"	5.0	"Star Wars ""Revenge of the Sith"" review, by Adam Platts"	2006-06-23	5	2	3

There was only a few scenes that had terrible dialogue, and they were all romantic scenes. Hayden Christensen has definitely improved over his performance in the second movie.

Estes	"Despite being a jaded ""Star Wars"" fan, which basically stems from my under-enthusiasm for the previous two prequels, I still stood in line last night, with all the geeks and misfits in tow, for the midnight screening of ""Revenge Of The Sith,"" the closing chapter that links all six movies together and gives all of us fans one last chance to enjoy ourselves watching a new ""Star Wars"" film. Not just that, this is also George Lucas' last chance to prove to his fans, and more importantly, his detractors, that he's still got it. Well, it's safe to say that the man has outdone himself.""Revenge Of The Sith,"" ""Star Wars III,"" or ""Episode III,"" whatever you choose to call it, is one word: breath-taking. Sure, you already know how it ends. Sure, the dialogue is a bit hammy and the actors tend to overact quite a bit, but that's sort of what makes this movie so great. It feels just like watching the original ""Star Wars"" movies. It has that same, authentic, feel that takes you completely out of the realm of the real world and let's you get sucked into a new world where all of your skepticism is left at the door. Two hours of non-stop action and drama, little nods to future films and memorable characters materializing along the way. It's hard not to watch The Chancellor transform into the Emperor, or more importantly, Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader, without a giant smile forming across your face. This is what all the build-up has been for. This more than makes up for whatever mistakes were made before it (Damn you, Jar Jar). I really shouldn't go too much into the details of the plot, but rather, I urge any fan, die-hard or casual, give the series one last chance with this one, you simply can't be disappointed.The last half-hour of the movie is where the real meat is, and perfectly sets up ""A New Hope."" If that movie didn't already exist, I would be pumped for it's release. If anything though, this film just made me appreciate the ""Star Wars"" flicks that much more. Now I find myself with the urge to go back and study every single little piece of dialogue, just like the true fanboy I have become. ""Revenge Of The Sith"" is everything a monumental movie event of it's kind should be, and George Lucas finally pulled off the impossible: A prequel that actually fits thematically and stylistically with the older films that everyone knows and loves."	5.0	The Redemption Of George Lucas	2005-05-19	14	10	4

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AL7OLWGAAH7K8	"Aitor Mendoza ""Artemis Fate"""	For those of you who are new to the Star Wars universe(What planet are you from?!) here is a brief story on the films.  Originally conceived as one film (supposedly) by George Lucas, Star Wars was thought by the studio to be too big for one movie, so George divided his story into episodes and decided to do Episode IV - A New Hope in 1977 because it worked as a single movie.  He then named it Star Wars, but kept the episode's title on the beginning scroll.  He figured if it doesn't work, it will be just one movie, but if the public liked it and it made money he'd do the rest of the episodes.  Well, the people liked it alright.  It became the top grossing movie of  all time, until E.T. came along, but then after the re-release in `97 it regained the top spot again with $460.9 million.  That is until Titanic came along with $600.8 million.  But anyway, its still # 2 and if adjusted because of inflation, it's the 2nd highest grossing film ever at $1026.7 million, after Gone With The Wind $1187.7 million.Anyway, even though it was his creation and it made tons of money, George didn't have a pleasant time directing that movie due to the limitations at the time.  So he passed the directorial reigns to other directors for Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back and Episode VI - Return Of The Jedi both of which continued the success of the original.  Many fans consider The Empire Strikes Back (which at the time was considered dark and didn't quite match the originals box office) to be the best of the trilogy and even the whole saga.  This is because here we learn who Luke Skywalker's father is and the story line gets elaborate and we have a few twists and turns that are later resolved in The Return of the Jedi.  Anyway after Return of the Jedi he decided to call it quits, since the trilogy ends in a happy note.  One thought remained in George's brain, originally the movie's story line revolved around Darth Vader, his childhood and his seduction to the Dark Side.  In these three movies, you only get to see his redemption and also Luke Skywalker comes off as the main character.  So George put off making any sequels and actually decided to scrap his idea to make it into 9 episodes.  He thought that if he did all episodes, he'd be well into his 80's and too tired to take on such projects.  So 6 episodes was his final decision.  He felt he needed to tell the beginning of the story and luckily for us started making Episodes I, II & III which show us Anakin Skywalker before he became Darth Vader.  So in 1999, after decades of waiting, Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace was released and then in 2002 Episode II - Attack Of The Clones.He directed both of them and that is probably the weakness of these movies.  Now don't get me wrong I love all these movies, 5 stars to all, but George is a storyteller and a special effects director, he is not good in the Drama department or the screenplay dialogue.  Some fans felt a bit disappointed with the last two movies, even though they still flocked to see them.  I wasn't disappointed, it is all one big movie and even though some of the dialogue was boring and some of the love story seems childlike (mostly in Attack of the Clones), I have a good imagination and go with the flow.  Had I been the director I would have eased on the quick editing and elaborate more on some of the feelings and characters scenes, I always feel that he cuts away right when there could be some more emotion showed.  In my opinion when I view each movie individually my favorite is still 1.) The Empire Strikes Back, then my second believe it or not is 2.) The Phantom Menace, it's the beginning of the story and I love the setting, everything seems light and pure, before the Dark Side starts messing things up.  I was not bothered by the dialogue, it explains all the politics at the time, I liked it.  I liked the Qui Gon character played by Liam Neeson and of course Darth Maul, the best Sith warrior in the movies in my opinion.  And everybody's favorite Jar Jar, the most hated character ever, who just happened to be digital, did not bother me at all.  I thought Boss Nass was more annoying, but it's a small price to pay for such an awesome movie.  Many disagree with me and consider this one to be the worst of the bunch, oh well.  My 3rd favorite is now 3.)  Revenge of the Sith (see below) then 4.)  Return of the Jedi and finally I'm tied for 5.) & 6.) with Star Wars A New Hope and Attack of the Clones.  Some days my least favorite is the original and some days Attack of the Clones, this is because I find the beginning of A New Hope a bit boring, only picking up when Han Solo is introduced.  But I still love them both.Now we are BELOW.  Ok I loved Revenge of the Sith.  I can't review a lot of it because I don't want to spoil it for you.  Here's what I thought.  It is awesome, mind blowing and dizzying at some points, maybe cause I was close to the screen or maybe because its jammed packed.  I did feel it was a bit rushed for me, hence my comment above of adding some of this story line to Attack of the Clones.  Also I hated the childlike tone in some scenes and the stupid little noises the droids make, it's supposed to be funny.  Anyway most of my demands were met.  Not entirely to my liking but they were explained or hinted at, specially the whole father issue with Anakin (watch the Phantom Menace).  I thought the love story was better handled here and Natalie Portman did a great job in all her scenes (she was given very little)  This movie makes the original 3 more poignant, you feel sad when you start seeing the repercussions of Anakin turning to the Dark side and you see what a jerk he becomes, you feel the betrayal.  I thought some parts were very well acted by all, some were ok, like Samuel L. Jackson's screaming, a bit overdone.  Yoda is cool, you get to see Chewie again and the movie just moves along quickly.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A14G1CE3AB3DV6	A. Jenista	"I wasn't terribly disappointed, but I didn't have exceptionally high hopes.The ""real"" first Star Wars movie was a swashbuckling action fest, with heroes daring to rescue a princess, a bad guy with a great sonorous voice (and bizarre religious convictions), and a swaggering renegade smuggler with his furry compadre; it was sci-fi at its very best, and of the like never seen before. It was totally unexpected.The problem with prequels is that for the first part, we already know how they will end. With Star Wars III, we know exactly how it will end, before seeing a single frame - all Jedis but Vader, Obi Wan, and Yoda will die. Padme will die giving birth to Luke and Leah. Annakin will give himself over completely to evil, Senator/Chancellor Palatine will become the Emperor, and Vader and Obi Wan will have the final fight where Vader will be forever scarred and crippled, to live in his robotic suit. And, that's pretty much what happens. The movie settles all scores, and we can all say we've seen it.The bigger question to me is this, ""Do we really need to see it? Does that make it any better?"" I would say no - I had no need to see Annakin go in to the temple sanctuary to slaughter all the child Jedis. What exactly was the point? Nor did I need to see the killing of the Jedi heros. Why bother?If you are the type that wants to drive slow by an accident, then this is the 5 car crash, with bodies and gore by the bucket. In Lucas' attempt to seal our hatred for the Villains, he has made this film inappropriate for any child under 15, or maybe older. It is stuff like this that make our society more callous; for some reason I expected more from the man, who painted such a hopeful future in his child-friendly Star Wars: A New Hope.Personally, I am sorry, and a bit ashamed with myself. I used to know very well that some things are better in a story left to the imagination. But Lucas has appealed to the voyeur in us all, and we are drawn to see this happen, even though we know the story, and know it can only end one way.So, how well was it executed? Haydn's acting was much better, to which I was great relieved. Ewan's acting was excellent, and Padme hardly got a line (though she delivers the best line in the movie, ""So is this how liberty dies? With thunderous applause?""). But the story seemed constricted, and every scene that was not a fight, a chase, or CGI, seemed affected by the outcome. It was like going through the inescapable motions of doom, with the characters barely able to scrape up real emotion or belief in the lines they deliver quite tersely, as they trudge along to their bleak destinies.But, as I said, I wasn't terribly disappointed; this is what is to be expected.I loved the effects, I loved the fight scene, and for a short time I even loved Palatine, for exposing the frailty of Jedi belief, and having them reckon for their pompous self-righteous rhetoric; the type that leads to putting people like him in power to begin with. But Annakin killing the children made my heart a stone for both him and the Emperor, so Lucas won out in the end. There were my bad guys, the good guys were clearly still the good guys, and all that was left was to see the showdown fight, and Annakin putting on his black armor.If you're a big fan, and you feel compelled to know, and your imagination cannot serve up a bigger, better, and more hopeful version, then I suggest to go.There is one ray of light for me - now hopefully Lucas can turn all this technology and money to something new for a change."	3.0	The expected happens about as good as expected.	2005-05-19	15	11	4

It is fantastic to watch the effects improve with each movie.	5.0	I wish there was one more trilogy.	2007-02-10	4	2	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3TLY1A7NGVCQM	"Alexander E. Paulsen ""AlexP"""	I guess if you are like me and have followed this story from the very start - yes I waited in lines to see the original - you kinda of have to see this one to fill in the remaining gaps and bring the story full circle.I have no issue with the concept or the overall story arc. But truth be told this movie is atrocious.The script looks like it was written over a weekend if that. It's obvious that a lot of the movie was laid out before the script existed, but that understandble to a point in a movie that ends a previously defined arc and the final installment of a trilogy. The whole thing was pretty much laid out in 1976.My problem with the film is that it's so poorly executed. Here we have a movie a cast of fine actors (with the exception of Hayden Christensen that is) and none of them seemed to be into or maybe even aware of their characters at all. The quality of the performances was embarassingly terrible. It was amusing to watch parts of the bonus materials showing Lucas atttempting to teach Hayden how to act - it didn't work. He still used the same dull monotone in each scene regardless of whether he was fighting or kissing.It may be the over reliance on CG. I'll bet that 99% of the scenes were filmed on greenscreen thus giving the actors no anchor to the scene in which they were performing. Maybe the current CG trend is just asking too much of human actors.Possibly this is the case since in my opinion the only character that showed any kind of believable expressions or emotion was Yoda and he wasn't even real.Star Wars III distilled to its essence was just a big loud cartoon with humans. The CG scenery ws beautiful but also sterile making it look too much like CG despite the photorealism.The movie was not all bad and there were several wonderful and moving scenes, but they were the exception.I hope that this movie wakes up Hollywood a little and sparks a trend towards slightly CG and special effects. When the day is done we go to see the story and the performances. Otherwise we are just watching a flesh and blood version of a Japanime cartoon. This movie was way too much like one.	3.0	Needs to be seen by all, but.......	2005-11-12	4	3	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A23L2BR07AOBG1	alex bushman	"#1 would have to go to Empire Strikes Back.  This is the best Star Wars film that Lucas has made so it shows off his strengths and weaknesses.  His strengths: action and visuals. His weaknesses: drama and dialogue.  With these two powers combined it makes for an uneven movie, but this film needs to be critiqued under a different system because it's related to other films and people have come to expect things.  One thing above all else is the lightsaber action.  Other less significant things are any other types of action, operatic battles between the purest of good and evil, and bad dialogue, really bad dialogue.  Oh yea, and a lot of special effects, some good, some bad with the good ones exceptionally outweighing the significance of the bad ones.  This film is the second best in the entire series because it delivers the lightsaber action big-time, it delivers a whole bunch of other action as well and most of the time, we are bombarded by gorgeous, digital establishing shots.  It gives both the ardent and casual fan what they expect when they come in the theatre and in that sense, it's one of the most successful summer blockbusters ever.  That being said, well, that's saying a lot.  One thing that Lucas deserves credit for is making the motivations during the crucial actions crystal clear.  This doesn't mean that he has improved his dramatic direction, or dialogue at all.  It's still terrible and the relationship between Anakin and Amidala suffers because of this.  Ultimately, this problem deflates the dramatic significance of this trilogy and doesn't make it resonant in the end.  However, there are bright spots in the cast and they are Macgregor as Obi-wan, Jackson as Windu, and that guy who plays Palpatine, they all display a certain subtlety while dishing out very obvious words and more importantly, their actions are believable and understandable as opposed to just being understandable and that's what Haden Christensen's performance as Anakin is, just understandable.  As before, there just isn't any chemistry between the two romantic leads and what little momentum their stoic romance can muster is muddled by the clumsy and childish dialogue they are given by Lucas.  It's really sad to experience, but unbelievably, it doesn't ruin the movie.  The reason for this is: we don't expect much in this department from Lucas (at least I don't)and our judgment on whether the film succeeds or fails is based on the action and visual execution.  In those departments he does better than usual and even surprises by at least making certain plot points crystal clear (how could they be muddled if everyone knows what they are, you ask?  Well it's happened before, money does that to people).  The result is the second best film in the anthology.  It eclipses ""Return of the Jedi"" because it doesn't feel as though it lingers too long,  that movie did.  I must also credit the film with integrating its appendices as opposed just putting them back to back to back to back as the last Lord of the Rings film.  You end up feeling the film's length, but you don't mind it.  That's the best thing about this one, the ability to overlook it faults even when they're extremely obvious.  Lucas has himself an accomplishment here, but he definitely hasn't made a great movie for reasons mentioned before.  My feelings on the film are that it delivers the goods to anyone who has a vague conception of what they might be getting going into the movie and knows going in that they will like it."	3.0	This is probably  #2 in the entire film series	2005-05-19	6	4	2

The script is just awful, the acting pretty bad, the special effects we've seen before (nothing new)...We knew the movie had a tricky ending (we've known for twenty years that the bad guys win), but other than this it had a great set-up: a republic transofrms itself into an autocratic empire without anyone noticing until it is too late, the hero becomes the villain...  When I think of what any decent director could have accomplished with this raw material, I wan to cry - or puke, I cannot make up my mind.If you need a permit to direct a movie, someone please take away George Lucas' - he shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a camera, ever!

Yet everyone, me included, seem much more interested in discussing the flaws of the film. Two things bother me most. First, Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman had no on-screen chemistry. Jake Lloyd (the boy from Ep. I) had more of a spark for Portman than Hayden did. Second, I hated that Padme was portrayed as an emotional and helpless mother to be. Padme served as a heroic Queen, a respected Senator, and fought in two wars. A woman with that sort of background would not have ""lost her will to live"" when Anakin died, she would have pulled together for her kids. It would have been more believable if Lucas had set it up so that Anakin caused her mortal injury in his fit of uncontrolled rage at Mustafar right before he fought Kenobi. Lucas was obviously trying to thematically hint at Romeo and Juliet (i.e., Padme could not live without her Anakin) but once again, Hayden and Portman could not pull that off."	5.0	Best movie of 2005, despite its imperfections...	2005-10-27	7	5	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3C6X0DAM87GN4	Alex Udvary	"After watching this, supposedly the final chapter in the ""Star Wars"" series it seems like deja-vu. Here we are three years after ""Attack of the Clones"" as the same agruments are being made against this movie by some people. Many complain the film's acting is stiff, the dialogue is poor, and the action is weak. And I find myself repeating what I said about ""Attack of the Clones"". Who goes to watch a ""Star Wars"" film for Shakespearian dialgue? Who goes to watch a ""Star Wars"" film and expect Oscar caliber acting? Isn't the whole joy of watching a film like this to sit in wonderment at what director George Lucas has created? Don't we go see films like ""Star Wars"" because it's fun to see what new characters Lucas has created, what new worlds we can explore, and those lightsaber fights? Is it just me or am I crazy? That's what I look forward to when a watch these movies. Nothing more, nothing less. To do so otherwise would be a mistake. Why? Because you're not going to get it and in the end will feel disappointed.But, despite this there are some flaws to this film and that in itself is sad. Because with this being the final chapter we really wanted Lucas to go out with a bang, and ""Revenge of the Sith"" doesn't quite do that in my opinion.First of all, all ""Star War"" fans know what to expect coming into this film. Here is one of the few times the audience isn't just a step ahead of some of the characters, we are actually three movies ahead of everyone else. This makes certain sense work that shouldn't have but also lessen some of the excitiment. We know Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is going to become Darth Vader, we know Padme (Natalie Portman) is going to die while giving birth to twins, and we know this will be the last time we see certain characters like Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), but this also adds a poignancy to some scenes exactly because we know what's going to happen. When Padme's children are born we already know what is in store of them and who they will become.But something else bothered me as I watched this movie. It was the first time I thought the special effects got in the way of the story. I didn't think that with the other two films, or any of the original three, but here, there were some scenes where the effects looked a little phony. It bothered me.I'm not going to go in detail over the film's plot, because I find that to be pointless. Anyone is going to see this film has some clue as to what to expect so all I'll say is ""Revenge of the Sith"" is not better than ""Attack of the Clones"". I really, really enjoyed that one. And I really really enjoyed the original three, one only other ""Star Wars"" films this one is better than is ""The Phantom Menace"". And to me that's not saying much because I didn't really enjoy that one too much.I also felt Lucas was under some sort of time pressure. Trying to hurry things by and get to the transformation. I didn't sense the struggle Anakin goes through. I thought over all the trilogy didn't do a very good job and presenting the person Anakin becomes. I think the original trilogy does a much better job showing how Luke transforms into a Jedi knight.But does anyone really care? The vote is going to be split down the middle here once again. Those that have defended Lucas in the past, with the two previous films will do so again. Those that were disappointed with the past two films will probably be disappointed again. In fact why they even bother to see the movie in the first place will remain a mystery to me.""Revenge of the Sith"" is the darkest of the trilogy, kind of the way ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was the darkest of the original trilogy, but this film is even darker. And to the pleasure of some I can tell you there is only one scene with Jar Jar Binks, whom I don't think even has a line of dialogue. And Chewbacca makes his appearance here, though it is very brief.""Star Wars"" fans will rejoice over this film, now they can finally move on with their lives, the sage is complete the tagline says, and will we also remember the world George Lucas has created for us.  *** 1\2 out of *****Bottom-line: Not the big impressive knockout the film should have been Lucas doesn't end the series with the bang he intended to, but, you have to give him credit anyway. He tries his hardest. Some flaws plague the film, but, fans won't really be paying attention to them."	3.0	All Things Must Come To An End	2005-05-20	5	2	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AX3Z95IPNLK0S	Ali Hosseinian	"I want to say that Revenge of the Sith is a fantastic addition to the Star Wars saga.  I completely enjoyed the entire Prequel Trilogy unlike some ""fans"".  I want to say this to the fans who whine & moan about movies they claim not to care about.  The Prequels are not the Originals.  I love the originals, I grew up with them in the 80's.  I am as hardcore fan of the original three as you will find.  The reason people have such a hard time with accepting these 3 prequel films is because people were convinced it had to be exactly like the orignal films.  That notion is ridiculous.  Episodes 4-6 are taking place in a time of REBELLION, of course the characters are going to be more feisty and easier to root for, it is always easy to relate to a underdog as Han, Luke, and Leia are.  Han Solo works so well in 4-6 because symbolizes a REBELLIOUS spirit, their is no need for a REBEL in 1-3 because their is nothing for are heroes to rebel against.  In the prequels the characters are in completely different situations, mostly people with power such as the Jedi and Queen/Padme Amidala.  The Anakin/Padme love story is differnt to the Han/Leia love story because Anakin and Padme are engaging in love that was forbidden and could ruin them, they had everything to lose by risking it.  Han & Leia had nothing to lose by falling in love, they were rebels just trying to avoid being killed by the empire and their was nothing forbidden about it.  Lastly I am and sick and tired of people complaing about the acting and dialogue of the films.  Firstly noone goes to a Star Wars movie for acting or dialgoue.  People go to Star Wars movies for 3 main reasons:1. Unforgettable Characters2. Fanatastic Story3. Great Special effects and BattlesI also think Hayden did a fantastic job as Anakin Skywalker.  He and Ewan McGregor made that duel fantastic and made it absolutely unforgettable.  I am glad I finally got to see how Anakin becomes Vader!P.S.:  I don't care if people find this review unhelpful, so go back to talking to yourself about how you hate Lucas and how he ruined your childhood!"	5.0	A sad end to the greatest saga!	2005-12-03	15	7	8

The movie is great, makes up for the previous two prequels. Ties into the original trilogy seemlessly as well.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1SBVESHFBLMP8	Alyssa	Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith is an excellent movie! This is the film in which Anakin's fall to the dark side becomes complete, and he is to be known henceforth as, Darth Vader! This film does a great job of showing how Chancelor Palpatine preys on Anakin's fears of losing Padme, in order to recruit him as a Sith apprentice. This movie also shows how suspicious the Jedi are becoming of Palpatine, and his increasing need for power, which will ultimately lead to the formation of the new Galactic Empire, and the fall of the 25,000 year old Republic. All this intensity culminates in the epic Order 66 scene, and the Obi Wan vs Anakin duel, in which Anakin is defeated by his master, only to be saved from death by Palaptine, and encased in the famous black suit and mask. Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith is a must see film, as it completes the prequels of Star Wars, and allows the entire saga to come full circle!	5.0	Great ending to the Prequels of Star Wars!	2013-04-19	2	1	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A23EQM24O960QP	A. MacPherson	"I thought the movie was pretty good. That being said, after seeing it, I know why it was rated PG-13--with the other 5 movies being only PG. The fairly traumatic visuals of death and suffering were more akin to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (whose release prompted the creation of the PG-13 rating at Spielberg's behest) than what is commonly associated with Star Wars. A couple of times, I had heard toddlers and young kids crying in the theater because it was a little too much for them while others were snugly being held in their parents' laps by the time the lights come on.It was no secret that this movie was supposed to be ""dark"", as it would obviously take some severe emotional (and physical) trauma to turn Jake Lloyd's Anakin into probably one of the most recognized icons of evil. Now, I do not mean to spoil some of the scenes for fans, so those who do not wish for examples can just take my word for it, and stop reading now, but otherwise I will give some examples and hope I don't ruin the movie for you in the process as opposed to just getting you prepared for what you (or more importantly any young kids that might go with you) will see.Anakin is the center of much of this carnage--going on killing sprees like the Sand People camp scene in Episode 2 on a number of occassions. From the trailers, you see a few clips of him slashing through members of the Seperatist Leadership while Obi-Wan's ""Who could have done this"" remark is spoken when he and Yoda are crouching over the slain ""Younglings"" (i.e. those little kids practicing with their mini-lightsabers in front of Yoda in Episode 2 while Obi-Wan was bewildered about the location of Kamino). Like the Sand People, the actual killing spree is not shown, with the scene cutting away with Anakin igniting his saber and coming at them (though part of the slayings would later be seen in a security camera holo). Finally, in the first of a few saber-induced limb-severings, Anakin grabs a second lightsaber and shears-off someone's head in cold blood in a fairly classic swords-as-scissors-type of move fairly early in the movie.Not so disturbing, but equally violent, is the sequence of ""Order 66""--i.e. the Star Wars equivilant of the ""Night of the Long Knives"" pogrom, though in this case it is the Clone Troopers against the Jedi as opposed to the SS/SA against German Jews. While the trailers' clips seems to imply that the Jedi are merely rounded up, what is actually happening is that the Jedi are attempting to lead advances underfire against the Droid Armies, only to have the Clone Troopers sneak up behind them and do the equivilant of emptying their magazines into them in the next couple of seconds. One is on screen, one they start firing into them but the camera pulls back and is obstructed by a tree before the scene ends, while two more just have the vehicles they were driving shot out of the air. Finally, Bail Organa's ""NOOOO!"" scream behind a speeder occurs when he witnesses one of the Younglings escaping the temple and attempting to fend off a half dozen clones, only to be shot down by a hail of blaster fire despite his valiant efforts.The violence is not just an exclusive domain of Anakin and Clone Trooper gun play. In the prior two movies, Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, Anakin, and the other Jedi would carve, impale, and decapitate droids with their lightsabers throughout the action sequences--which is one thing. However, in this movie these attacks are mostly directed towards the human clone troopers after about the first third of the movie. This can be a little more ""real"" for people than just mere robots--consciously or subconsciously.Finally, and most significantly, is the immolation of Anakin, and his subsequent Darth Vader-izing, at the end of the movie. When someone is ignited on fire, it is not a pretty sight during--and especially afterward; Anakin looks like that Japanese mortar crewman from ""We Were Soldiers"" that was hit by napalm in the friendly-fire incident during the ""Broken Arrow"" airstrikes scene. His body is shown fully--with some close ups and obviously accompanied with agonizing screams--for a good 5-10 minutes of screen time. This includes the time it happened, his retrieval by the Emperor, and finally through the fairly grisley surgery that grafts all of his cyborg and life-support components to him.One other little note you might want to prepare for is that it was no secret that Padme was going to be pregnant throughout this movie and one of the more anticipated moments was the scene at the end where she gives birth to Luke and Leia. This might prompt a few ""where do babies come from"" questions since it is so rare for a movie to feature pregnancy (at least beyond a few romantic-comedies)--let alone birth. So you might wish to be aware of that."	4.0	Parents/Feint of Heart: PLEASE READ--PG-13 for a Reason	2005-05-20	3	2	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3EBHHCZO6V2A4	"Amaranth ""music fan"""	"George Lucas intended for Anakin Skywalker to be a Lucifer-like character,full of greatness,hope,and promise,and falling terribly through his pride. At this point in the story,Anakin is among the greatest Jedi knights,but is impatient at not being promoted and disgruntled at his abilities being overlooked. In ""Phantom Menace"",Anakin was portrayed as a bland,boring boy who gets into the Jedi knighthood thanks to a blood test,and in ""Attack of the Clones"",he is a brave warrior who's compromising his vow of celibacy by making moves on Princess/Senator Padme Amidala.In ""Revenge of the Sith"",Anakin and Padme are now secretly married,and somehow manage to live a bourgeois married life on Coruscant,home planet of the Jedi. They have an apartment,and the affair seems to be conducted behind everyone's back in front of everyone's face.Surprisingly,Obi-Wan Kenobi is very understanding about the whole thing,and doesn't even give Anakin a slap on the wrist. Anakin&Padme;'s marriage is forbidden...but not that much. George Lucas could've given the love story bigger stakes,and realistically show how celibate Jedi (who are basically monks) would deal with an erring member.Since Anakin learns of Padme's pregnancy,he has nightmarish visions of her dealing with childbirth. There's an Oedipal undertone to this,since Padme is supposed to be motherly towards Anakin (she is older),and he's afraid of losing her like he did his own mother. This fear of loss turns Anakin to the Dark Side of the Force.Anakin's ""conversion"" is,unfortunately,unconvincing. Anakin's transformation from a frightened husband to a bloodthirsty killer doesn't really work. The only convincing scenes are towards the end when he lashes out at his visibly pregnant wife,nearly strangling her,and his battle with Obi-Wan.The highlight of the movie,other than Ewan Macgregor's amazing turn as Obi-Wan,are the final battle scenes,Anakin's sole sexy shirtless scene,along with the birth of Luke&Leia;,and the ""birth"" of Darth Vader. Lucas powerfully juxtaposes Padme's death in childbirth from despair with the gruesome surgery that turns Anakin into Darth Vader.When the Darth Vader theme is finally played in its entirety,it sends chills down the spine. ""Revenge of the Sith"" is the strongest and darkest of the prequel trilogy,and the conclusion is a perfect starting-off point to ""Star Wars:A New Hope."""	3.0	Anakin's fall from grace	2007-10-08	4	1	3

And it seems I was right to expect not much from that last Prequel.Not only does the acting get worse, making it very difficult to believe in Anakin's inner conflict between good and evil, but the movie lacks the serious tensions and dramatic dimensions it should have: OK Annakin turns into Darth vader; so what ? it takes and lasts after all only a few minutes before he surrenders to the Dark side and pledges allegiance to Palpatine in a glimpse of an eye.  What happened to the climax one could expect from such a choice that would decide for the rest of his life ??? Well, nothing really.  No deep analysis/description as how it affects him, dividing his soul, tearing appart his beliefs, changing his fate (almost) for ever etc.As for the movie itself, well, it gives us what it said it would : entertainment.  ILM made a tremendous job with the Special effects.  But, appart from them, the story fails to bring us all the serious answers we were (all?) expecting :  Where does Anakin come from, as even his mother Schmi was very ""dark"" about his origins in EI? No answer as to who might be his father ? Or why he does not have one, Etc...Well, for those who believed they would get some kind of a Starwars Holy Grail after a 28-years quest, that will not do. And, that's serious disappointment, I tell you.  Lucas said the six movies make one single story told all along. I agree but he could have told us the whole thing with less than three chapters for sure now that I look at the six episodes...  Is it unfortunate or already part of some marketing plan to extend the Starwars universe/story beyond the movies.  Who knows...Because, by making it six, Lucas should have provided us with the many answers to all the questions asked in the previous chapters, especially about Anakin's origins, the reasons why the Jedi thought he could be the Chosen One to bring balance to the Force, according to some Prophecy (what about it by the way ??)And, no more clues as how the Sith have been Jedis' ultimate enemies, apart from knowing they are on the other side of the Force Etc...I will not list here the many points that feed my bitter disappointment and make me feel like this entire prequel saga does not bring anything satisfying about the true story of Starwars.  But be sure that if I were to meet a Dark Sith Lord right now, no doubt I would turn myself to the dark side.  After all, anger, pain and sufferrings do lead to the dark side, don't they ??

Problem is that they're wrong; this is a deeply flawed movie where despite the strictures imposed by the story arc, plot has been sacrificed for special effects and fight scenes. The movie starts at full tilt dropping the viewer in the middle of a battle where the Android general Grievous has succeeding in kidnapping chancellor Palpatine. Who is this General, where has he come from? Explanations aren't forthcoming, though trawling through reams of additional canon material may enlighten those who feel the need to find out. Padme is reduced fairly quickly to a tearful ineffectual brood mare, which is a shame as looking at the outtakes reveals that an entire plot thread that clearly leads to the foundation of the rebel alliance has ended up on the cutting room floor. Much of Natalie Portmans work went with it, apparently to make way for another of the incessant and protracted lightsaber battles:-  Dooku/Skywalker, Kenobi/Grevous, Windu/Sidious, Yoda/Sidious & Kenobi/Vader etc.Don't get me wrong the action sequences are very well done and the special effects are top of the line, but the plot and logic have clearly been sacrificed to get just that one more explosion into the available time window.Perhaps most inexplicable is Anakins conversion to the dark side, he was always an arrogant twerp, but his capitulation to the blandishments of the Sith lord was feeble. ""Join me young Skywalker and gain godlike powers"" "" OK "" and that's it, from arrogant, but generally well intentioned Jedi to homicidal child murdering loon in the blink of an eye.There are hints of a better film, here; the emotional vacuum at the heart of Jedi philosophy, How Bail Organa got involved. Unfortunately none of it got the attention it deserved, being bulldozed by the inexorable avalanche of special effects and CGI.It's not a bad movie, but it clearly could have been a great deal better if George Lucas infatuation with effects had been reigned in and the story line been given more room to breathe.I remain immensely glad that I own a set of unadulterated pre CGI tapes of the first three films. They remain the best thing Lucas has done and I deplore his continuous attempts to revise and improve. They don't need it and have not benefited from this incessant tweaking.Though I may be persuaded otherwise if he could edit all those blasted ewoks out of existence."	3.0	Overloaded CGI thins plot to point of invisibility	2005-11-08	17	13	4

Maybe it's an ego thing, or maybe he really thinks this stuff is the cream of the crop of film making. I don't know. All i do know is that Part III is hardly better than Part II, and only a few action set pieces highlight it. The intro battle is fun to watch, but emotionally hollow. How they pulled that off i don't understand.I watched the Clone Wars CARTOON the day after watching Sith and not only was i emotionally engaged with the characters and action, i was on the edge of my seat. It was EXCITING!Episode III, and all the prequel trilogy really, botches the opportunity to delve deep into the Star Wars myth. i've read a lot of the Expanded Universe that has evolved over the years, and much of that would have made an excellent film.All i can say if that they DO make more sequels, make them cartoons.	3.0	Not that Good	2005-05-25	10	3	7

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AP9UOXX9272YO	"Amazon Customer ""Noble Poet"""	So it is here.  Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.  In a long anticipated wait to see the film, I watched the beginning with strong hope that this film be better than Lucas' 2 recent prequels.  It is.In this film, those who are not familiar with the books or stories as originally told (like me), discover just how young Anakin Skywalker turns to the Dark Side.  Never knowing beforehand that Padme plays a significant role, I learned for one that she is the love of Anakin Skywalker, and the mother to Luke and Leia.  After seeing the age difference in the first Episode, and not knowing Padme's role in the books, this came to me as a surprise.Moving on, we see how the Republic falls to the Dark Side and how easily it is turned, much due to the desire to grow in power.  We soon find  out who the Sith is (if no one had figured it out already in Episode I), and the viewer can now understand how Anakin turned and why he did.  Anakin's desire to grow more powerful, mixed with his uncontrolled emotions of fear, makes him vulnerable to the Dark Side and is easily swayed.  His transformation to the Dark Side marks the end of the Jedi Council, and nearly all its members.When Obi Wan learns the unthinkable truth, that his apprentice has turned to the Dark Side, he is faced with the mission to destroy the now Darth Vader.  This difficult confrontation can be compared to the confrontation Luke has with his father in Episode V.  Though in Episode VI, Luke overcomes his fear to face his father ultimately, Obi Wan cannot finish the job.  The scene observing Darth Vader transformed into more of a machine than a human was in my opinion, very well presented.The downfall I had with this film was again, the screenwriting (like in Episode's I and II).  The script was weak in the beginning, but gradually came to back to life.  The performance by Natalie Portman as Padme unconvincable to me.  I respect her very much as an actress, and look at her with someone with great potential, but I do not believe she was fit for the role of Padme.  I thought that the age difference between Padme and Anakin should have been made more apparent.  It seemed to me that Anakin got older from Episode I-III, and Padme got younger.  Just my opinion.Hayden Christensen performs B class for the role as Anakin/Darth Vader, but I thought it was a grade better than his performance in Episode II.  He portrayed vulnerability quite well.Ewan McGregor did his consistent role as Obi Wan rather well.  His character did not seem to change much between episode's I and II, and you could even say it is matched with Alec Guinness' performance as Obi Wan in Episode's IV-VI.  Ewan McGregor is just a bit faster with his weapon (like all characters).I thought the highlights of the film is the special effects (of course), the scenes showing the fall of the Jedi Knights, the transformation of Darth Vader, and the role of Yoda.  We finally learn just how strong the Force is in Yoda and just how well he can use it to fight.  We now understand why he is left to go into hiding.  As one who never read the books of Star Wars, Yoda's role in Return of the Sith clears up some misconceptions I had.  And who didn't want to see Yoda fight?  It was about time!Overall, I'd give Star Wars Episode III: Return of the Sith 3.5 stars.  The plot was clear, the action was well animated, and the roles of the people were fulfilled with meaning I hadn't seen in the previous 2 Lucas films.  The screenwriting and the cast is the only thing I would have liked to have seen better.	3.0	Better, Not Best	2005-05-22	5	2	3

The first two films suffered from underwritten dialogue and insufficient characterisation. Fortunately Episode 3 is a big improvement over the first two prequel films.Not that that isn't saying much.The first twenty minutes of this film are absolutely stupendously breathtaking. As far as humongous droolworthy space battles for the modern era - this is the one to end them all. Seeing those two Jedi Starfighters flit between these lumbering behemoths and massive explosions is worth the price of admission alone. Another great aspect of this film is the obvious close camraderie between Anakin and Obi-Wan. Great big kudos to George Lucas for FINALLY giving his two stars a chance to shine. There's a lot more fire and passion to Ewan MacGregor's and Hayden Christensen's performances this time around. And the dialogue in those first twenty minutes are as good as anything you'll find in the original trilogy.The film begins to sag towards the middle, despite the inclusion of a great fight sequence between General Grevious and Obi-Wan Kenobi. And then the last 30-40 minutes the pace really picks up - THESE are the moments that George Lucas has been aching to write (and we've been waiting to see) for these past nine years. It really is great to see that origin finally up on screen, and the passion shows - both in the actors performances and in the way those sequences are written. And, as John Williams promised, his music absolutely totally soars here. I was actually moved almost to tears by the ending to this film - and that's quite remarkable considering just how much I really hate these prequel films.And has anyone notice just how nicely the very beginning of Episode 4 ties into the ending of Episode 3? They use ""prequel characters"" in that intro to tie the two sets of films together. Amazing how he could anticipate that over twenty years ago.So would I recommend seeing this film? Much to my surprise, yes! But only for the first 20 minutes and the last 40 minutes of the film. I think George Lucas and co. have done a much much much better job in this film than in the other prequels. The acting - particularly from the three leads - is much much better than in previous films. The dialogue has that slight spark that made the original trilogy such a joy. And John Williams music - especially right at the end - is really given a chance to soar. And despite the apparently bleak ending, the music (did I mention that already?) along with the visuals give us an incredible sense of hope that all is not lost."	3.0	Worth watching for the first and last 20 minutes	2006-09-24	7	5	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3TNM3C9ENUCFW	"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster"""	"George Lucas's much awaited and anticipated ""filler"" Episode III is the movie that (arguably) most fans have been waiting to see the most, to see just how Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) will become Darth Vader etc etc etc. The movie opens in the midst of a huge star battle with Anakin and ObiWan (Ewan McGregor) attempting to rescue Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from the evil clutches of Count Dooku, and General Grievous (a sort of droid with one or two internal organs), and never really lets up in pace or impressive visuals throughout. For those who have followed the story, this begins 3 years after the last movie and sets about filling in all the holes between then, and the emergence of Luke Skywalker in the original picture, and does so very well, in my opinion. The strength of the movie lies not only in the visuals, but Lucas's uncanny knack of holding your attention throughout the movie, when you already really know the ending (assuming you have seen the original Star Wars picture) or where it is heading at least. It's the journey from A to B that absorbs you, and is enthralling and entertaining, even if it feels a little hurried during the last 20 minutes or so of the story.This is a dark movie however, with hardly any moments of levity as so often welcome in the other movies in the series, and deals with the insidious and beguiling evil of Senator Palpatine, turning the young impressionable Jedi from good to Evil. I'm not going to go into the story any more than that really, as it will be undoubtedly covered in many reviews and websites. Speaking of reviews, it's had a mixed reception with the media, and criticized for some stilted acting, and lack of passion in some areas. Christensen may not be believable enough in tender moments opposite his secret wife Padme (Natalie Portman), but he more than makes up for this in other areas, particularly in one rather distressing scene (cleverly alluded to off camera) where he is seen to pass the point of no return on his path to the dark side. On the whole I found this to be a great movie, with lots of action, a tight script, and some good acting, particularly from McGregor and McDiarmid. Yes it has some problems, and one or two areas where I felt even the seamless CGI was top-heavy, particularly in the light saber battles. But overall this is head and shoulders above the last two movies, and time will judge as to its success and appeal when compared to the original picture now over 25 years old. One or two scenes may distress very young children, but other than that this is a good family movie, which like the final Lord of the Rings movie, has now heralded sadly, the end of an era"	4.0	The Circle is completed	2005-05-22	5	3	2

Some, like myself, love them for what they are.  Others absolutely despise them.  But most will agree that they simply don't live up to level of the original series.  But even if you agree that George Lucas scored 2 strikes with Episodes I and II, with Episode III he knocked it right out of the ballpark.I absolutely loved this movie.  In my opinion, it did rise up to the level of the original series.  Even though I pretty much had a rough idea of everything that was going to happen, to see it played out on screen was a very emotional experience for me.  Why was Episode III so much better?  Because this was THE story that everyone was waiting to see.  The first two Episodes were really prologues.  With Episodes I and II, even though I enjoyed them, I still had the feeling that they were a little contrived.  For instance, the big action scenes in those movies felt like they were put in there for their own sake rather than to advance the plot.  It was like, ""now here comes the pod racing scene"", ""now we're going to give you the double-bladed lightsabre battle"", ""now we're going to show you Yoda in a fight"", etc.  In Episode III, not only are the action scenes among the best in the series, but they don't feel contrived at all.  They actually advance the plot along.Check out the opening shot after the crawl.  Its one of the most breathtaking (and longest) special effects shot you'll ever see. The first half hour (the rescue) is absolutely thrilling.  General Grevious is a great villian.  Not only is he unbelievably cool, but his presence in the film has an actual point.  He represents where Annakin Skywalker is headed if he continues down the dark path.Plot holes?  Yes, there are a few minor ones, but by and large Mr. Lucas has wrapped things up pretty tightly.  It could be argued that Owen Lars would have recognized Threepio, but its been established that protocal droids are extremely common in the Star Wars universe.  Plus, he had different plating when he first lived on the Lars homestead, and in Episode IV, he never actually introduced himself by name to Owen Lars.And in Episode VI, when Leia claims to have remembered her mother, its never established exactly who she is referring to.  It could have been Bail Organa's wife, who may have died when Leia was very young.  Bail Organa may have remarried, and Leia may have assumed that his first wife was her real mother.  Its a stretch, yes, but in Episode VI she did not seem to have any knowledge of her true origins.  If she knew about Padme, wouldn't she have wanted to go to Naboo to find out the whole story?  Wouldn't she have found out about Annakin and Luke as well?  Wouldn't she have asked her father, who was still alive in the beginning of Episode IV, about her true origins?Another, simpler argument could be made that Leia remembered her mother though ""images and feelings"" because she was unusually strong in the force.All and all, this is a great film.  Now when I watch Episodes IV-VI, I actually believe its Hayden Christianson under the helmet.  That's something that Episodes I and II didn't achieve."	5.0	The Magic Returns	2005-08-11	3	2	1

Reading the plot line before it comes out not only ruins the magic, but spoils the fun. As to those who think this will be horrible based on I and II, give it a chance before you hack it to death. I personally liked PM and AOTC. Not as much as ANH, ESB, and ROTJ, but I liked them. But even if you don't like them, that does NOT mean this will be the same. Who knows? I watch IV, V, and VI because of the action. I watch I, II, and III because of the story line. Yes, the action is cool too. But it's the storyline that intrigues me. How all the Jedi save Obi-Wan and Yoda are killed off, how Anakin makes the final choice to the Dark Side and becomes Darth Vader, how the Republic becomes the Empire, what happens to Padme and Luke and Leia right after they're born.

For those of us that grew up on the original trilogy, these new ""Episodes"" may seem rushed, over hyped, and largely exaggerated.  In a sense they were.  George traded in puppets for computers and actors for stars.  TPM was a huge disappointment to most as was ATOTC.  Need I mention Jar Jar?I have never considered myself a Star Wars geek and I never will.  I enjoy a good movie, but would never wait in a 4 month line to see it.  This movie, ROTS, is the big pay off we have long waited.  I watched TPM and ATOTC and found myself entertained during each but I was always missing something the original trilogy had.  Something deeper.  ROTS brings that meaning back and ties together the two trilogies in traditional Lucas fashion.As I write this, I find myself attempting to avoid any spoilers, but it seems inevitable.  Do not read on if you do not want to know...Episodes I and II were not so much episodes as they were introductions to Episode III and I find, having watched Episode III now, that if you consider the prequel trilogy as one movie instead of 3 different movies, Episodes I and II become forgivable.  The prequels are about Anakin becoming Vader.  Everything else is just fluff.  Watching Episode III, you get that!*****************************SPOILERS*********************************Episode III leads us through the creation of Vader, the birth and separation of Luke and Leia, the death of Padme, the fall of the Jedi, the rise of the Emperor and the Sith, the creation of the Empire and the Death Star, and Yoda and Obi-Wan's exile.  Episode III introduces MANY of the characters and elements of the original trilogy.  This is the movie prequel.  Episodes I and II lead to this and perhaps could have been cut down to one movie.  Everything you need to know about the original trilogy happens in this movie.I did feel that some of this movie was rushed, and understandably so.  Lucas tried to condense so much into 2  hours, that portions almost left me craving more.  I am positive that a DVD release of this movie will fill in some of that.  Lucas does a fantastic job during Sith of foreshadowing, however subtly, Anakin's descent.  Ewen McGregor does a fantastic job emulating Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan.  Natalie Portman's character felt a little snubbed by a lack of screen time but Ian Mcdirmond makes up for it by introducing us to the Evil Emperor.  His few stints on screen are both memorable and illuminating.My biggest complaint about the movie is the lack of Jedi action.  Aside from the climactic Obi-Wan/Vader battle and the Emperor/Windu battle, light sabers seem to be missing.  Over all, I think this movie will satisfy fans, young and old and leave them with a satisfied feeling that the 6 movies are worth the price of admission."	5.0	Star Wars:  The Long Awaited Pay Off	2005-05-20	0	0	0

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A29X0YEL6O4KZI	"Andrew J. Dobrow ""Career Writer"""	The saga is complete! Star Wars Episode III is by a wide margin, the best of the newest three entries to the Star Wars realm. The opening battle sequence is a magnificant display of Special Effects and high tech weoponry. The one on one light saber duels are masterly choreographed.Although some of the acting seems a little droned out, the majority of the movie is a science fiction buffet. In recent memory, there has not been another movie that has shown itself to have such beautiful aesthtics. The beauty of the sequences unravels, and you are drawn into your seat.And of course you cannot forget the transformation of a man to a monster. Anakin Skywalker succumbs to the dark side of the force after being persuaded by the Sith Lord that the Jedi are no more than power hungry fools. Although he is hesitant at first, as you can tell by his actions of telling the counsell Palpatine's offer. Though, his hunger for powers are soon to much to control.The final battle between the now Darth Vadar and Obi-won Kenobi is a brutal and emotional duel between to men that used to be not only teacher and student, but best friends. This is were the reason for Darth Vadar's robotic armour is revealed.This film also shows how the Stih Lord plays with the heart strings of Young Anakin. By using guilt and bribery, Anakin is now consumed by the dark side.The end of the film poses a seamless transition to A New Hope and is a beautiful way to begin the series all over again.Not only is this film the best of the new three, but I believe that aescticly it is a modern Sci-Fi classic, and is a mighty fine way to end the series.My Favorite Star Wars Movies (from favorite to least):1. A New Hope IV2. Return Of The Jedi VI3. Empire Strikes Back V, Revenge Of The Sith III (tie)4. Attack Of The Clones II5.

DUNCAN ""Movielover"""	I enjoyed this, but did not like it to the extent that I usually do, at least not to the extent I liked all previous versions of the story--however--upon reflection, I realize that this is the plateau in the story that--in retrospect--set the stage for the rest of the story (other versions), which may be what soured me a little on this one.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3EW4TUSY1HAXC	Andrew Mcdonald	I had a fun time in the movie theater watching Revenge of the Sith and would certainly recommend that ALL star wars fans get this as the action sequences are superb and the light saber fights are breath-taking. Also, this movie contains more planets (some new, some old) than any previous star wars movie. The scenery in some, especially the lava planet, is fantastic. I watched it in the movie in theaters (twice) and rented it a few times before finally deciding to buy it.But if you are a star wars fan, you probably have already bought it anyways. And so I would like to discuss some of the problems I had with this movie that any person who is on the fence about buying it should know.My number one problem was Hayden Christen's acting, which earned him a well deserved Razzie for worst supporting actor of the year. This kid can't act. Period. He can scream, he can swing a light saber, but he can't act. The middle part of the movie was especially painful to watch for all the wrong reasons because this is the part where Anakin puts away the light saber and starts talking. I can only guess that Lucas hired him because he fit the physical requirements of being a young Darth Vader. Although I did think that the actors playing Obi-wan, Yoda (he's CGI, I know), and especially the evil Emperor Palpatine did a good job.Anyone who believes the love story between Anakin and Padme wasn't botched is deluding themselves. In fairness to Hayden, I don't know if any duo could make this kind of dialogue work:Man: You are so beautiful.Woman: It's only because I'm so in love.Man: No, it's because I'm so in love with you.Roger Ebert is right: To say that George Lucas can't write a love scene is an understatement. Christmas cards have more passion.This movie had the potential to be better than the original and possibly on par with the Empire Strikes Back. That said, this is still a good movie, at least as good as Return of the Jedi. My two cents.	4.0	Good movie, but...	2006-12-29	5	4	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1D6DFC3AGV3JZ	Andrew Parodi	"""Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"" has been criticized by some for cardboard acting, stale dialogue, thin plot, and over-the-top special effects akin to a video game. Yes, all of these elements are present. But have we forgotten that they were also present in the original trilogy? I recall a flimsy plot in the first Star Wars movie (now dubbed ""A New Hope"") about some top secret plans that basically said, ""Shoot in this hole and the Death Star will explode."" I recall Han Solo exclaiming, ""One thing's for sure, we're all going to be a lot thinner,"" as the walls of the garbage compactor closed on him. And I recall the Ewoks looking cuddly and lovable and completely out-of-place for a science fiction movie. ""It didn't have a very successful ending,"" Harrison Ford recently said, ""what with that teddy bear picnic.""It seems that my generation, those of us around 30, have forgotten about the flaws of the original trilogy and have unfairly measured the new trilogy against our idealized and nostalgic recollections. We have also forgotten how young and impressionable we were the first time we saw Star Wars. Most of us were from ages 5 to 10 when we were first introduced to the Star Wars saga. As children, we didn't care much about the weak plot, we didn't notice the occasionally corny dialogue; we weren't bothered by some of the flat acting. All we cared about was the great special effects, the awesome action sequences, the nifty getups worn by the villains, the exotic locations, the huge spaceships, the hinted-at yet never-fully-explained spiritual system known as The Force. It was a swash-buckling space adventure fantasy to help us escape everyday life. It worked for us as little boys (and some girls), but we are unrealistic to expect it to have the same affect on us as adult men.During my second viewing of Revenge of the Sith (I saw it at 12:01 am and then at 4:10 pm on May 19th), I realized that many of us are not so much frustrated with George Lucas for not continuing the fine tradition of the original trilogy. We're frustrated with him for not being able to turn back the clock and restore to us that idealistic innocence we had the first time we saw Star Wars. We're adults now. Go watch the original trilogy through your adult eyes and you will see the inherent silliness was always there. Go watch The Bionic Woman, Little House on the Prairie, The Facts of Life, Silver Spoons, through your adult eyes, and you will see the same. The impressionability of youth allowed us to see past and excuse many of George Lucas' failings as a director and writer. George Lucas hasn't lost his touch. We've lost our youth.On the other hand, even George Lucas himself admitted that there isn't much story to this new trilogy -- or at the very least he spread it very thin. In a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, Lucas admitted that about 60% of the story of the prequels can be found in Episode III, with 20% being found in Episode I and 20% in Episode II. The rest, he admitted, is filler -- pretty special effects to delight the eyes. Lucas explained that this prequel trilogy was written merely as a back-story to support character placement and development in Episodes IV through VI. He said that he could've rewritten the story of the prequel trilogy in order to make it more intricate and sophisticated, but he wanted to keep the prequels true to the back-story that he had written back in the early 1970s.If you go into Revenge of the Sith hoping for it to rekindle your childhood, then you will be disappointed. If you accept Revenge of the Sith for what it is -- a fun, sci-fi, popcorn movie for the masses -- then you'll enjoy yourself."	5.0	Accept it for what it is and you will enjoy it	2005-05-25	17	12	5
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ABSX5TGEGRH76	"Andrew ""Radaar"""	"Ok, I'll admit that, while Episode 1 was a disappointment, I didn't  think that it was as terrible as some people say.  Also, I thoroughly enjoyed Attack of the Clones; I realize that it does have flaws, but on the whole, I think that it was a good film.  But both Episodes 1 and 2 have been panned... a lot, both by critics and fans.  So as Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith neared release, there were equal amounts of anticipation and worry.  Fortunately, I can definitely say that not only was this movie the best of the new trilogy, but it also can contend with Episode 6: Return of the Jedi (although, Empire Strikes Back is and shall always be the greatest of the Star Wars films).A few years after the end of Attack of the Clones, we find that the Clone Wars are winding down, and the Republic has nearly won the war.  However, there are still a few loose ends to tie up, involving Seperatist leaders Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus (Christopher Lee) and General Grievous (Matthew Wood).  Leading the fight for the Republic are Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), now a general and Jedi Master, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), and Jedi Master Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson).  While Kenobi goes off to a distant planet to help fight, Skywalker has been asked by the Jedi Council to spy on Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), whose growing power in the Senate has begun to worry the Jedi.  Meanwhile, Anakin's wife Padme (Natalie Portman), whose relationship with Anakin must remain a secret, has just learned that she is pregnant.When fans first heard that George Lucas was doing a prequel trilogy, I have no doubt that the material covered in this movie is the stuff everyone has been waiting for.  WARNING: BEWARE OF SPOILERS (However, it's not like I can give away the ending for you).  We finally see Anakin's final steps to embracing the Dark Side of the Force, we learn how Emperor Palpatine became so scarred and disfigured, we see the final development of the Empire, and we finally see the purging of the Jedi Knights by Anakin Skywalker himself, now using the Sith name Darth Vader (and let me tell you, this leads to some great death scenes, especially Mace Windu's).Of the many positive aspects that this film has going for it, the one that I want to mention first is the improved acting by most of the actors in the film, especially Hayden Christensen.  Now, keep in mind that I'm speaking relatively of course; Christensen still won't win any awards for his performance here, but it is much improved over his performance in Attack of the Clones.  Getting to see Darth Vader again is always a plus, so that definitely helped this movie.  Then, there was Obi-Wan's desperate speech to Anakin near the end; while in Episode 2, we were TOLD that Obi-Wan and Anakin were good friends, we didn't really feel it.  Not the way we felt it in this movie.  At the beginning, we finally saw the bond between these two Jedi Knights, and at the end, when that bond had been broken, it was amazing to see the effects.  And then, it's great to see how everything comes full circle at the end; we see transitional ships and costumes that fill the gaps between episodes 2 and 4, and we even get to see some familiar old ships, such as Bail Organa's (Jimmy Smits) cruiser featured at the very beginning of the very first Star Wars movie (A New Hope).  We also get to see Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) again.  It's too bad that they decided to cut out Han Solo from the script.  In earlier drafts, it is said that a young (probably 10-year-old) Han Solo would play a ""small but important"" role, but he was ultimately cut out because the didn't think that anyone would be able to fill Harrison Ford's shoes.  Finally, the closing shot of this movie is just so great, as it reflects a key shot from the original trilogy (there's no way I'm spoiling this one).Having listed this movie's strengths, I must now list its weaknesses.  While the acting did improve a lot, it still wasn't anywhere in the neighborhood of great, and the same goes for some of the dialogue.  Fortunately, there were a lot fewer bad lines than there were in the last two films, but when the dialogue was bad, it was REALLY BAD (such as Obi-Wan's comment at the beginning about ""Being smarter than this"").  Then of course, there were just some of the same problems that plagued the previous two films, which dealt with annoying creatures.  For example, the droid army still speak in really dumb, high-pitched voices.  And, there was this creature that Obi-Wan used as a ride, and its voice was extremely annoying.But the positive far outweighs the negative here.  Lucas has finally done for the prequel trilogy what he did for the original one back in the 70's and 80's.  It's too bad that he won't be going on to make Episodes 7, 8, and 9, but when viewed as a sextrilogy (no, that's not a dirty term, it means a series of 6 movies), Star Wars can be seen as being centered around Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader.  It shows his rise, fall, and redemption, and it is a very interesting story."	5.0	An Epic Comes To A Dramatic Close	2005-05-19	4	2	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A20F0VHBQ48NFF	Andromeda	"Words don't describe how wonderful this movie is. It is a masterpiece. Everything in this movie is perfect. The acting, the special effects, everything comes together so beautiful, so perfectly, and so tragically. We open in the biggest space fight in history as the Separatists are attempting to leave Courscant with the kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine. Anakin and Obi Wan fly in assigned with the task of rescuing the chancellor. Both are even better looking then in Attack of the Clones. Upon arriving on the ship they immediately realize it's a trap set by Dooku. As Obi Wan says so well ""Let's spring the trap.""  They find the Chancellor and Dooku starting the first awsome lightsabre duel.  Obi Wan is quickly knocked out of the fight leaving Anakin and Dooku. Anakin defeats Dooku using the dark side of the Force.  At Palpatine's urging Anakin kills him in coldblood taking another step towards the dark side which Anakin immediately regrets and is horrifed by his actions. I love the way Hayden Christienson played Anakin so well from his cold blood murder to being confused by his actions.This are not the ways of the Jedi. Palpatine tries to assure Anakin that it was all right and that Dooku was too dangerous to keep alive. He then tells Anakin they need to get off the ship and to leave Obi Wan behind. This time Anakin refuses Palpatine's order and goes to retieve Obi Wan. I love the way Anakin looked at Palpatine and told him ""His fate will be the same as ours.""After an exciting crash landing back on Courscant Anakin is reunited with Padme who tells him she's pregnant. Anakin's over joyed but that's quickly destroyed when he has a premontion that night of Padme dying in childbirth. Similar to the dreams he had about his mother before she died. Anakin's determined not to let this premontion come true. Anakin goes to Yoda first to seek advice who gives Anakin the typical Jedi response after all the Jedi aren't suppose to have attachments.  The scene between Yoda and Anakin is very well played. Here's  Master of the Jedi order and the Chosen One in Yoda's small room both of them almost completely cloaked in darkness with only a little light illustrating how neither one of them is truly seeing the other person.Anakin's relationship with Jedi Council has become difficult to say the least. His close relationship with Palpatine has the Council concerned especially now that the Jedi are growing suspicious of Palpatine. They don't like the way he keeps finding ways to stay in office even thought he's term has expired or how he keeps getting more power voted to him through the Senate or the way Palpatine interferes with Jedi affairs.  Including putting Anakin on the Council as Palpatine's personal representitive. While trying not to be controlled by Palpatine the Jedi in fact end up doing exactly what he wants by denying Anakin the rank of master knowing it'll create more cracks between Anakin and the Jedi.  The Jedi have their suspicious about Palpatine but they have no proof so the Council ask Anakin to spy on the Chancellor who inturns ask Anakin to spy on the Jedi. Which side will Anakin chose?Palpatine being his helpful self offers Anakin an answer when during that incredable opera scene Palpatine mentions a Sith legend about how a Sith was able to keep those he cared about from dying knowing full well this was exactly the answer Anakin was looking for. At least a glimmer of hope that there was away to save Padme. Ian plays the role of Palpatine flawlessly as he insidiously moves all the pieces into place for his endgame. He's got to be the best villain I've ever seen.Back that the Jedi Council Obi Wan is chosen to be sent off to defeat Grevious and hopefully put an end to the war over Anakin once again this is exactly what Palpatine wanted. Its such a tragedy watching the Jedi Council scenes knowing these Jedi are trying so hard to stay out of Palpatine's manuiplations and bring an end to the war and get Palpatine office without them realizing that they are in Palpatine's trap.  That's really the hard part for the Jedi is that their enemy Palpatine knows them so well that he knows exactly what move they will make even before they make it. I mean its like watching a football game where one side has the other team's play book.Obi Wan goes off to face Grevious but not before the beautiful and emotional pack of his last conversation when Anakin apologizes for his behavoir and Obi Wan gives him praise. You know this is the last time they'll be friends which makes even more emotionally packed. I'm usually pulling out the tissues at this point in the film.Once Obi Wan is gone Palpatine reveals himself to Anakin who turns him into the Jedi Council. Mace takes four Jedi to arrest the Sith Master but orders Anakin to stay behind because of his mixed feelings. Mace and the Jedi arrive in Palpatine's office and attempts to arrest him. What follows completely surpised me. Palpatine leaps from his chair and kills three of the Jedi leaving only Mace. Now I know Palpatine's a Sith and Sith use lightsabres despite that I was shocked that Palpatine had one. The dueling being Palpatine and Mace is amazing.Back at the Temple Anakin's contomplating things and he has Palpatine's voice (literally) in his head warning him dies all hope Anakin has of saving Padme dies with him. Anakin gets up and looks out the window out at Padme's apartment. Padme sensing Anakin gets up and goes to her window. This is one of the best non-speaking scenes I've ever seen. You see the emotion and love between the two while Anakin makes his decision.Anakin arrives at Palpatine's office to find way appears to be a very similar seen to him and Dooku. A Jedi about to kill an unarmed person. Of course Palpatine set it up to look just like that unlike with Dooku, Palpatine's playing possum. When Anakin cuts off Mace's arm Palpatine hurls lightening at Mace which sends him out the window and to poor Mace's death. Samuel L. Jackson did an awsome job of protraying Mace from his frustrations with Palpatine over not stepping down from chancellor to conflict with Anakin to Mace's conversations with the other members of the Council. I like how Mace did originially intend to simply arrest the Chancellor and was unprepared for how powerful Palpatine was to his attempts to get Anakin to realize that Palpatine was the traitor.This is Anakin's irreversionable step to the dark side of the Force. I love Anakin's horror of what he just done, that he made the wrong choice and realization that he can't go back. Anakin kneels in front of Palpatine/Sidious to become a Sith and receive his name of Darth Vader. Its an emotional and powerful scene at the same time. The intercut to Yoda on Kaskyyyk clutching his chest in confusion while this was going on was amazing.Anakin now Darth Vader marches up the steps of the Jedi Temple leading a legion of clonetroopers while we go from planet to planet through the galaxy to watch the heartbreaking scenes of the Jedi being gunned down by their own troops. Its heartbreaking, devastating and so sad to watch people who devoted their entire lives to the Republic being gunned down and declared traitors of the Republic and the Jedi in the Temple being killed by one of their own. Yoda dropping his cain as he felt the pain of the Jedi being killed was very well done.This is where Senator Organa, Leia's future adoptive father shows up at the Jedi Temple demanding to know what was going on only to be turned away by Clonetroopers at gun point. Organa leaves but not before witnessing a Youngling attempting to escape gunned down.  Jimmy Smits plays his part every well. I love his line ""And so it is."" At being told it was time for him to leave. It was the line and the expression of someone who's worse fears had just come true. Organa leaves Courscant to find surviving Jedi he finds of course only Obi Wan and Yoda. They decide to return to Courscant Organa to attend a special session of Congress where Palpatine declares himself Emperor to the sound of applause. Its an amazing scene caped off with Padme's perfect line ""So this is how liberty dies, to thunderous applause.""Intercuting this scene is Anakin/Vader slaughtering the Separatists. Indeed the Republic's dead. At the Jedi Temple Obi Wan's shocked at the finding even the Younglings were killed and wants to know who's behind it. How wonderful and yet tragicly fitting  that Obi Wan doesn't realize it was Anakin until he goes to the security holograms. Ewan McGregor who's all ready been putting in an incredable preformance as Obi Wan Kenobi pleades with Yoda to send him to kill the Emperor so he wouldn't have to go and face Anakin. You can see in his eyes and words of desperation he doesn't want to be the one to kill Anakin. But Yoda wisely and rightly knows that he must be the one to take on Palpatine/Sidious.Obi Wan hides on Padme's ship after to follow her to Anakin after informing her of Anakin's turn. Natalie Portman who's also been putting in an incredable preformence gets even better as she goes to Anakin. This scene between them is so perfect. Padme wants him to say that it wasn't him or that Obi Wan's claims were crazy. But Anakin doesn't. He tells Padme that he's becoming more powerful then any Jedi could ever hope to be and he's doing it for her to protect her.  He tells Padme of his plans to over throw Palpatine and they can rule the Galaxy Anakin says this in a tone of desperation, of insanity, of unstablity, irrational and Hayden completely sells it..that in this moment of craziness Anakin truly believes this. Padme slowly begins to back away from Anakin realizing that Obi Wan was right that even though she loves Anakin and would follow him any where she can't follow him down this path. She tells him that you can see a switch in Anakin/Vader as Padme pleades with him to come back but Anakin/Vader's not seeing her anymore he sees Obi Wan behind her and is outraged believing that Padme bought Obi Wan with her to kill him. Padme's protests are silenced when Anakin/Vader force chokes her. I love the way Obi Wan advances on Anakin/Vader ordering him to let her go. Anakin does and she falls. Obi Wan and Anakin  circle each other slowly Anakin clearly consumed by the dark side and Obi Wan trying to get Anakin see that. You can see Obi Wan's trying not to end up fighting Anakin but realizes after talking with Anakin that there's no other way. They begin the amazing Obi Wan and Anakin duel we've been waiting thirty years to see and weren't disappointed. They fight through the buildings and around fiery lava. They both know each other so well they know each other's fight and it a long time before Anakin's defeated. I love how Obi Wan tried to get Anakin not to make that fatal jump which severs Anakin's remaining arm and legs. Obi Wan's emotional cry to Anakin before picking up Anakin's lightsabre and leaving.Intercut is Yoda and Palpatine/Sidious fight which is just as incredable. The two masters of their orders battling it out light vs. dark winner takes all duels in its well done. Palpatine hurling Senator pods at Yoda who sends them back.  Even thought Yoda ends up being the one to withdrawl from the battle I say it was a draw. Yoda realizing that withdrawls from the battle and is rescued by Organa. The they meet up with Obi Wan who's carrying Padme. Intercut between Anakin being reborn in the black suit Padme gives birth to Luke and Leia and dies but not before telling Obi Wan that there's still good in Anakin something which we know Luke will take to heart. Padme's body is sent back to Naboo for her funeral while Leia and Luke are sent to their respective homes. We actually get to see a glimpse of Alderaan and Leia's adoptive mother. The final second with Ben, Beru, and Luke standing where Luke will eighteen years later is a beautiful way to end this emotional roller coaster of a movie...and a great way to end the series.Everything in this movie was perfect. All of the actors played their rolls perfectly.  The special effects was perfect. Little details like Governor Tarkin with Palpatine and Vader on the Star Destroyer looking at the Death Star. Return of Tantive VI, the ship Leia will be captured on to Padme holding Anakin's gift to her from The Phantom Manace during the funeral prosession. Revenge of the Sith was everything I wanted it to be but even better.Although it the deleted scenes and not the actual movie I did like the scenes with Padme and the Senators you could see the beginnings of the Rebellion. I love how it was started by Padme and these Senators and would lead to Empire's defeat by her daughter Leia. I have seen this movie a hundred times and I'm still blow way with how amazing it is. Its truly a masterpiece."	5.0	A Masterpiece	2007-07-29	10	6	4
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A119FSJDJJEJP4	Andy Kuhlman	This is without a doubt the best Star Wars since the originals. Every time I watch some part of my mind says that Anakin won't really turn to the dark side and then betray his hot wife, but then I realize that its only a movie and then I am ok. I would say it is one of the best movies of 2005, right along with Batman Begins. My question isHOW THE HELL DIDN'T IT GET A SPECIAL EFFECTS NOMINATION FOR THE ACADEMY AWARDS, OR SCORE, OR BEST PICTURE.I can't imagine what the people are thinking who decide who gets what at those awards. Yes it is one of the best pictures for this year and yes it has one of the best scores for this year, and yes it DOES HAVE THE best special effects of any film this year. Take it from me, a movie lover with home theater, this puts to shame King Kong and thats up for an Academy award, what a shame. What is to be expected when the best picture and acting and score might go to a movie about homosexual cowboys with a nobody director and a nobody composer and nobody actors. WHen I realized this, I was almost glad Star Wars was nowhere to be found in the mix. But then I realized that it was being nominated for best make up!!!!!!!MAKE UP, BELIEVE IT, I'M NOT LYING, IT GOT GYPPED ON ALL AWARDS, AND THEN WAS NOMINATED FOR BEST MAKE UP. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH. THAT IS THE MOST PATHETIC THING I HAVE EVER HEARD. THe academy awards have gone to HELL.THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE DESPITE THE CRITICS AND ACADEMY AWARDS PEOPLE, A GREAT LOVE STORY MIXED WITH DEEP EMOTIONS, GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS, EPIC OUT OF THIS WORLD WAR SCENES, AND A GREAT SCORE TO GO ALONG WITH IT.LUCAS DID GREAT ONCE AGAIN	5.0	Best of the New Trilogy	2006-02-02	6	4	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1J4UEQFQG9WL	AndyPratt	im surprised to see that the rating for this movie at amazon is so high, due mostly to the fact that there are a good amount of people out there that were totally disappointed with the film, some of those people have very good reasons to be and thus i respect that, and some are just pompus...well, lets begin. If you have seen this that most likely means you have seen the other 2 movies that lucas made as well, as a spontaneous idea only intended for him to get more money off of the star wars name (does anyone really believe he really planned on making these but couldnt cause of the lack of 'special effects' for the time? lucas presented himself as a true artist, maybe not the best but he was able to basically create everything in the first trilogy out of sh*t so would that reason really have stopped him?) and for any fan that loved the origional trilogy we all knew deep inside our hearts that its greatness couldnt be compared too or out done by lucas, because to do so would only make the begining of the epic tale good and everything would go down hill from there, causing many to loose interest after the third movie. in that aspect im thankful these movies werent anywhere near up to par.quite frankly when i saw this movie i was surpsised and have to admit its the best film ive seen all year in the theaters, but thats mostly cause im a fantasy freak and the other movies i have seen where of the type of The Grudge and Cursed... with that said, this movie is great to kill a few hours with and if you can let yourself escape your cynical judgement scales you will be drawn into the world and brought to various places and atmospheres that are beautiful and can only exhist in the mind.but in respect for all the star wars buffs who werent fond of this movie, there were some pretty bad parts too this. first off the acting isnt that good (natalie portman can't act for sh*t) and the other acters you could tell had no interest in the actual 'life' of the star wars legacy, but were there just to make some bucks. and then there are many loopholes that Lucas didn't even bother to fill in (probobly due to his lack of heart and ambition to finish what he origionally created)for those examples read one of the top reviews, one of them does a great job pointing out things that a by-and-by movie goer never even noticed. because of this, i subtract one star, because lucas shouldnt of half assed this movie, expecially this movie out of all the 3 in this series.but i wouldnt say that lucas totally screwed it up, it did have its moments. Mostly in this i have to promote the wonderful display of how human emotion can cloud and totally screw up our judgement over things that we already know to be wrong. Anakin obviously ignores reason and common sense to follow a fantasy like 'vision' that he so dreads to have come true. so many people hate this and think its so stupid, but the inner poet in me absolutly loves this! Anakin is so in love with his wife at first, becasue from what we see that after he lost his mother and due to his life of slavery and lonliness, she is the only person that he can trust to really care for him besides ben kenobi, and theres only so much a person can trust with a mentor/teacher. even though it is just a dream it keeps on happening, and we all have had nightmares that we were afraid to come true. So when Anakin finds out about Palpatine's offiliation with the dark side (keep in mind he never knew before this movie) he cannot help but be interested in finding a way out of the dire situation that could happen, and since palpatine mentions it to him this can only lead Anakin to believe the dream more, after all did he tell palpatine? no.Anakin's character was never ment to be a mentally healthy and purely stable character, so for the viewer to really think that using intellectual reasoning is really an option here is proposterous! do you know how much more the whole series (and life itself) would suck if we all stopped to think? everyone would be to cowardly to fall in love, try new things like mountain climbing, flying, and even driving, or finding medical cures or ailments that seem controversial to an unnaccepting society in the earlier times (christian persecution anyone?). it only makes sense that Anakin follows his inner hearts ambitions into the 'dark' side (after all, what is dark? what is evil? what makes evil bad? and if a person can feel good about themself and in control, are they really bad?) so this begins his downfall and degredation to the person he becomes later.i loved the twist of anakin turning on the ones he spent his life with helping and trusting, and finally killing the woman he so much loved in the end. this reflects on the human natures ability to become corrupted with power, history has shown this with influencial people (think of hitler). once anakin let in the true darkness becaus of his ignorance, he became corrupted and vile like all of things he once hated, this explains for his actions and intense hatred shown to kenobi and his wife. Lucas was thinking through all this so i do not believe it was any mistake that the now Darth Vader character asked if padame was alright, due to his emotional relapses and conflicts of power within himself anakin does not have the ability to function as a mentally stable human being in any way shape or form. what we have now is a insecure, darkened figure controlled by his inner fears, and a lust for power.i definently agree the acting could of been better, the special effects didnt impress me too much though theyre good, and i dont mind the robots but they shouldnt be saying stupid cutsey crap. if lucas took more time to have planned the rest of the story he had centered around the emotional drama, we could of all seen a better movie, and what would of made it even better would have been if star wars was never as popular as it is now, because remember with power comes corruption, we clearly see this with lucas making the films more kiddie.and this is my final comment, star wars was never ment to be kiddie, but it was never ment to be adult entertainment either. star wars was supposed to be fantasy, a thing that people of all ages could use to escape their otherwise dreary and unproductive lives with. it was supposed to show to us not how things really happen, but how they should happen when times go bad. remember when luke almost died at the hands of palpatine, and vader found it in his heart to save his only blood son, the only rememberance of his wife and his old self he has? there is so much to star wars that is behind the initial products (the damn movies and books) yet most people will be too afraid or cynical to give open philosphical analization a chance. just cause a movie sucks doesnt mean the story does, if you dont agree with me then fine, we all have different opinions. but if you cannot watch a movie with out being a cynical, analyctic, pompus fool and not even bother to forget that none of the things such as acting, special effects, or camera angles are supposed to matter anyway, then your life must really be more depressing than mine...	4.0	loved the movie	2005-06-09	8	2	6

However, the horror that was Episode Two is yet to be dissolved by the liberal amounts of Clorox I have applied to my eyeballs.  I'm still reeling from *that* one.  Shocking--really, as I am normally lenient when it comes to the Star Wars franchise (hey, I was willing to like ""Return of the Jedi"", yes?).  I suppose I wasn't expecting the cheese until Episode III, but now that I am anticipating ""Revenge of the Sith"", it makes sense that the cheese, sap and schmaltz was dumped in the second episode.  Better to purge now than later, I think, was the motto when ""Attack of the Clones"" was released (man... when I heard that title, I already had a bad feeling about it.  Oh well, que sera sera).  Now, with ""Revenge of the Sith"" I am looking forward to the darkness that so overwhelmed me in ""Empire Strikes Back""; the thrill and heart-wrenching shock I received when Darth Vader said, ""I am your father!"" (waaay before pop-culture turned it into a joke, I assure you.)  I am looking forward to this installment of the series, but Mr. Lucas... shees, this better be the last.

I was enthralled by the commercials, and was bouncing in my chair like a giddy school girl all the way to the theaters.  I had already read the book, which is really good, by the way, so buy it ASAP.  I sat in my chair, and was expecting the usual, you know... end of the scrolly stuff at the beginning, and then starships flying around or towards a planet.  Instead, Lucas gives me the most epic spacebattle yet.  I was blown all the way to the back row by each scene!  Every scene was amazing, and blew away the one before it...  I'm still shaking from the perfection of it all.  The only con some have is that the dialogue was corny, with the Anakin and Padme parts, but it overall didn't really affect the movie.Everyone is always saying that nothing can beat the original three.  My personal all time favorite movie was The Empire Strikes Back.  Episode III has changed it all.  Ep. I... ok, ya know, pretty good... Ep. II... better, but still needs some more work in the action department... Ep. III... (writer falls into coma after recalling the mind-blowing events of Ep. III)... sorry, I'm back.  But seriously, Ep. III delivered more major lightsaber battles in one movie than the other five combined.  I could go on for days...The only things I'm hoping for is that Lucas, or maybe someone else will continue the series with 7, 8, and 9; or maybe remakes of the originals to help to make the effects better.	5.0	THE MOST FREAKIN' AWESOME POSSIBLE END (?)

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2I4VTPKGSQZ75	Anthony Hand	"Geroge Lucas's Star Wars series comes to an end...well, comes to the end of the beginning anyway and I can't help but feel relieved, cheated and underwhelmed. That the Star Wars prequels won't live too long in my memory or heart was obvious from the first two misdirected films. It was very clear that Lucas had lost his vision and was simply incapable of producing a batch of films that equaled or rivaled the first three. Actually, one could argue that the writing was on the wall during ""Return of the Jedi"", which contained some very dodgy parts indeed.It's not difficult to say what's wrong with ""Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"", they're the same problems as episodes I and II. Poor plotting, mediocre to appalling acting, confusing or downright silly action scenes and some truly awful characters all play their part in ruining the viewing pleasure. Into the mix is thrown the fact that none of the actors hearts seem to be completely in the project, except perhaps Ian McDiarmid, who turns in another trilogy winning performance as Senator / Emperor Palpatine. Ford, Hammil, Fisher and Co. also thought that they were in a rather silly mess of a film, but enjoyed themselves nevertheless and still managed to turn in decent performances at the end of the day. And though the aforementioned actors of the original series were no `screen burners' by any means, they were leaps and bounds ahead of the absolutely appalling Hayden Christensen, who has been lumbered with a character of central importance and he is simply just not up to the job. Don't get me wrong, he's much better in Ep3 than he was in Ep2...but that certainly isn't saying much. Never once does Christensen convince the viewer that he is dealing with the stress that the story of Darth Vader demands.The other failings of the preceding two episodes are still apparent in Ep3, although less so, I must admit. Although there is no Jar Jar Binks and that's good, we still have those incredibly annoying (Roger, Roger) `droids and they still exude an utter impotence. Besides them George has presented us with another ridiculous character in the Confederacies' General Grievous. A cyborg being, encased in a metal suit / structure who has amazing Jedi powers even though he suffers from a chronic cough...all the more amazing than his Jedi powers, because he apparently has no lungs! In one idiotic sweep, Lucas destroys what could have been a decent villain.The CGI effects too are insipid, although the opening battle wasn't bad, even if it did include silly space `droids that rip up Republican spaceships. They're not a silly idea per se, but are rendered so because Lucas has seen fit to give them cutesy sound effect voices. Therefore eliminating the threat they potentially pose. The CGI effects also still are unable to match the grittiness of the model work of the originals and as a general rule are still a long way off from doing so too. But it remains quicker and cheaper to execute.""Revenge of the Sith"" is a film of two halves. I'm tempted to say the Bad half and no-so-bad half, but that would be somewhat unfair. In reality the last hour of the film isn't that bad and goes some way to recapturing the flavour and excitement of the originals. There is a sense of oppression in the latter half of ""...Sith"" that was completely absent from Ep1 and Ep2 and therefore there is a sense of the gravity of the situation. But unfortunately this is too-little-too-late and really cannot redeem what was a quite dreadful series of films.There is, however, a darkness in Anakin Skywalker's descent into Darth Vader that may have some children of an overly sensitive nature feeling uncomfortable. The final scene, where Kenobi and Skywalker duke it out, is easily the best set piece of the entire current series. The culmination of which is Skywalker's battered and burned transformation into the dark lord of the Sith, `Darth Vader'. It's all very interesting, even if Vader's first words are laughable.All in all, ""Revenge of the Sith"" remains a mostly unsatisfactory end to an very unsatisfactory trilogy. The films never seem to belong to the superb originals and always come off as some other director's pale rip-off's, even with all the bells and whistles attached. Ultimately, there is no need to expose ones self to this series to enjoy the original series. In fact, doing so could render the possibility of diluting the impact of Episode IV, V and VI a reality...At best, Ep3 can be used as a semi-introduction to the original trilogy, even though the history is questionable in some places. For instance Leia says that she had some ""memories"" of her mother in ""Return of the Jedi"". Quite impossible if Padme died in childbirth.""...Sith"" can be viewed without having viewed Ep1 and Ep2, but I am left with the feeling that what is really needed now, more so than the Vader back story of Ep1, 2 and 3, is the story of what Darth Vader did during the 20 years between Anakin Skywalker's transformation into the Dark Lord, up to the events in Episode IV.Just don't let George Lucas direct it."	2.0	Here comes Darth...	2007-02-19	17	13	4

"After the horror of Jar Jar Binks and the disappointing Attack of the Clones, my hopes were not that high for Revenge of the Sith. As a HUGE fan of the Original trilogy, I had no hope that any of the Prequels would reach up to the original's level of quality. Revenge of the Sith proved me dead wrong. Let me just say that it's ending packs all the brutal two-punch combo of ""I am your father""/""I love you""""I know"" in Empire Strikes Back.The climactic lightsaber battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin is surprisingly hardhitting. George Lucas pulls no punches, and, while the film starts off with a fun, if not particularly groundbreaking bang, and the middle is mostly Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen moping, politics, and something about some Sith lord named Darth Sidious, the ending is absolutely memorable, brilliant, and haunting.While Sith is nowhere near the quality of A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back, it is at least better than Return of the Jedi, and far finer than either Menace or Clones.  In its own right, and as a satisfying and tragic trilogy-capper, Sith delivers; as a tie-in to the Original trilogy, Sith delivers; as an ending to the sad saga of Anakin Skywalker, Sith delivers. As an adventure film, and action film, and a space-opera, Sith delivers.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A29Y34ALWJUGB5	"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment"""	I was sceptical about this one. Episodes I and II were horrifying compared to the masterpieces from the late seventies and early eighties. Nothing in I and II seemed right (except for Yoda). All the seriousness in the plight of the characters were gone. Jar-Jar? Pod races? A boring two-hour romance? No space pirates and furry creatures? But then Revenge of the Sith came out on DVD and perhaps saved the entire trilogy from falling into damnation. Revenge of the Sith, while still not as good as the original three movies, has everything a Star Wars fan has come to know so well. Darth Vader, Wookies, space battles and land battles, Yoda, Yoda with a light saber, and that horrible mechanical breathing that has become legendary in American society.Alone from the series, this movie stands up well. It has great action and dramatic characters (though no new characters). The drama and suspense that surrounds the young Darth Vader is visible in every action he makes. The ending is relevant and leaves you wanting more. The movie, from start to finish, just carries itself well.My one problem, however, is the throw-away characters. Without spoiling the story for those who haven't seen this movie, there are two characters that seem to have been put in the movie merely to create two action scenes and to lengthen the movie. Both characters have played dramatic roles in previous Star Wars projects (that includes the animation) yet are little more than extras here. But, in the scenes they are involved in, the action is great, so that does make up for some of their apparent uselessness. Thrills still win out over story in American film.Obviously, I recommend this movie to Star Wars fans, but also to fans of great action. I'd also recommend picking up the animated Star Wars Clone Wars Volume 1 so that there's little confusion between Episodes II and III.	4.0	Not a Stinker	2005-11-02	6	4	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1DIO5OVSSB86L	"Anton Jackson ""agentundercova"""	George Lucas has completed a seemingly impossible task - he's bridged together two generations with one single film.After disappointing critics and hard-core fans alike with the first two installments of his trilogy of Star Wars prequels, George Lucas has redeemed himself with a dark, gothic, furious and stunning Episode III in Revenge of the Sith.This final installment in the Star Wars franchise contains little or no narrative suspense - no querying and quarreling about intergalactic politics in this one. Oh, no, we know exactly where it's heading. And it contains little to no real surprises, since the majority of the fans easily will have figured out its one plot-zinger from the earlier episodes.But that doesn't seem to matter at all. The film captures you from its exhilarating trademark opening sequence and pulls us mercilessly along its course with the grip of the last gruesome act of a tragedy. Its entrancement is not what happens but HOW it happens.But one important fact, perhaps more than any movie sequel or prequel ever made, is that this one requires our acquaintance with what's taken place before and after. If you haven't watched the other five episodes, or at least refreshed your memory recently, then you might be lost.Therefore, the film pitches us three years into the Clone Wars and a critical situation in which Obi-Wan and Anakin must rescue the abductted Chancellor Palpatine from the fiendish possession of Count Dooku.From there, the movie darts us to the planet of Coruscant, where the increasing danger of the Separatist druid army inspires the war-weary Senate to hand over its power to a dictator, in which a achievement is in the works that will transform the Republic into the evil Galactic Empire.And the key to this event, dating back to The Empire Strikes Back, is the seduction of Anakin by the Dark Side of the Force: Not from lust of power but as a deceived act of love.When Obi-Wan discovers that his apprentice is defecting, he immediately has to stop him as it all boils down to an epic lightsaber battle on the volcanic planet of Mustafar that will end, of course, with the creation of one of the greatest movie villians of all-time: Darth Vader.Why is all this so much more captivating and breath-taking than The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones? The fact is that it's because those two earlier outings contain a large majority of the character construction, which was essential, of course. While Revenge of the Sith is an entirely breakneck-paced story.Whether you believe that or not, some others may reference Episode I and II's wooden acting, uninteresting characters, confusing political mumbo-jumbo and excessively tedious and floundering action. But there's absolutely no question that this series finale is the structurally secure, dramatically tense and appetizingly gloomy installment that people have been waiting for.Want an idea of how gloomy it is? Well, it's the only Star Wars film with a certified PG-13 rating and it's, quite frankly, it's certainly the most gothic of them all - visually and conceptually. It's the inevitable story of a pleasant character sinking into depths of pure, authentic evil.A young children will definitely have difficulty following what is probably the most political of the Star Wars plots, and containing some nipping parallels to our own present post-9/11 world.But the cast towards the climax deliver surprisingly enjoyable performances. Christensen epitomizes Anakin's unique blend of strength and weakness with style, charisma and magnetism. McDiarmid nearly steals the show, with his excellently diabolical turn as Palpatine, Natalie Portman manages several emotional scenes with great effectiveness and even Ewan McGregor finally suggests that he could grow up to be a believable Alec Guinness.Apart from all this, the real feat of Revenge of the Sith is that it bridges the prequels to the original trilogy in small, delicate ways, such as using numerous musical references to the original `77 score, and in the larger way of reconnecting some of us with our childhood memories.And there you have it. The Star Wars saga has come full circle. What would have been predicted as another disappointing prequel, Lucas proves the majority of us wrong and redeems himself in the process. The space opera that many grew up to love has finally been connected in a magical way. The story of one man's journey from the Light Side, to the depths of the Dark Side, and back again is now complete.	4.0	The Story Is Complete	2005-05-19	9	7	2

This movie seems to satisfy fans, knowing kids love violence today and are use to seeing it in everything they watch these days. I was excited when I first saw the opening credits, but my anticaption turned into boredom. I knew that the movie would lag in places, and I would be disappointed. Wookies were seen about 10-15 minutes in the movie, Darth Vader was only seen in about 2 minutes, so many things that irked me. The action was heavy, probably making alot of fans happy. The story seemed to be rushed, and I watched part 4 when I got home and noticed many errors from part 3. I think Ewan Mcgregor played a better Obi One then Alec Guniess did almost 30 years ago; The prequels made Obi-one cool, but in part 4 he is a bore and is killed off very fast. The storys dont match, and the movie was killed for me after seeing part 3. Why realize parts 4,5,6 then realize a computer generated borefest of parts 1,2,3?

As you can tell, I'm one of the group that was underwhelmed by the lastest Star Wars trilogy. The first two (Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace (Widescreen Edition)&Star Wars - Episode II, Attack of the Clones (Widescreen Edition)) had to be endured in the hope that the ""The Revenge of the Sith"" matches up with the standard set by the first Star Wars trilogy (Star Wars Trilogy (Widescreen Edition with Bonus Disc). Although better that epidodes 1 & 2, and more intense, it doesn't. The film still leaves you wanting more substance.The Amazon review states ""Episode III is easily the best of the new trilogy--OK, so that's not saying much, but it might even jockey for third place among the six Star Wars films."" No, sorry. Easily ranks fourth. And to be honest I wasn't a huge fan of episode 6,Star Wars Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983 & 2004 Versions, 2-Disc Widescreen Edition). I felt it had too much of a ""muppet"" feel to it. But Episode 3 suffers the same issues as 1 & 2, too much dependence on special effects. Way too much. In this type of film do we want great special effects? Absolutely! And Episode 3 succeeds wonderfully. But we don't want the effects to overshadow the main plot or the characters. This is where the movie fails. Time and time again I found myself concentrating on the effects and not paying that much attention to what the characters were doing.But, I guess overall we have to have the series. It wasn't a dud, and therefore a good purchase, if only to round out your Star Wars Collection. When George Lucas originally wrote the plots for Star Wars he actually wrote 9 episodes, and has said time-&-time again that he is not interested to filming episodes 7 - 9. Based on episodes 1 - 3, I think that is a good idea. But if he does eventually choose to do so, let us hope that he will retain only the Executive Producer role and pass the actual film making duties to better directors.

I kept on hearing about how this character is like Darth Vader on steroids but he just sounds goofy like he's from Jar-Jar's tribe.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AGO5LRUVQLH0Q	A. Schneider	"You know I was expecting this film to be at least ""good"" if not ""great."" I was deeply disappointed by the last two ""Episodes"" prequels, but this debacle just confirmed my thoughts: whatever masterpiece George Lucas made, he also managed to ruin it with his last three Star Wars movies.One of the worst things about this movie was probably the high amount of goofy comedy. While this has often been a criticism of the ""Episodes"" I thought this movie was at least slightly better than the last two. However, this movie surely pales in comparison with the original Star Wars movies. The comedy factor alone is a large one to consider.In the original Star Wars trilogy there was comedy, but not a goofy, childish comedy we see in movies today... it was a sophisticated comedy, whereas here it just seems to have been in poor taste (probably for younger audiences). One example of how poor comedy was used in the movie can best be illustrated in the movie's beginning: some of the creatures early in the movie were burping and excusing themselves while serious events were desperately trying to catch the viewer's interests. In addition to that another scene comes to mind, a scene where a Wookie on the Wookie's home world swung from a vine and made a Tarzan sound... amusing? I suppose, but not when a few seconds later the audience is expected to feel sympathetic for Anakin's conflicting emotions.Another criticism which this film shares with modern action films is the poor use of expensive CG. Somewhat familiar with designing computer graphics myself, I realize how much time and money they must have put in to make many of the CG scenes throughout the movie: unfortunately they put so much so CG in this movie (as well as the last two ""Episodes""), that the movie ends up feeling ""plastic"" or fake while the battle scenes seemed rushed and over dramatized. However it should be noted that in this reviewer's opinion the CG was far better in Episode III than they were in either Episode I or Episode II.Another major criticism which I see has been shared among both Star Wars fans as well as the common movie-goer is the fact that the acting in the ""Episodes"" has been of extremely poor quality. Episode III is no expectation in fact this movie probably has the worst dialogue and acting of all the Episodes (save for the child portraying Anakin in Episode I). The dialogue is phony and the characters seem time shining through as the Anakin's actor seems to whine out his lines like a child... is this dark side naivety? No, instead it is a poor casting choice which Lucas was forced to stick with. Too bad. The other performances aren't much better - a huge Samuel L. Jackson fan - his part in the movie was minor as it always is, his dialogue was just cheesy as one would expect from such an action movie. I suppose some movie-goers can forgive the actors and script designers for this flaw, but an avid sci-fi and fantasy enthusiast, I cannot and find it extremely insulting.Romance scenes? As always they were poorly done and worth a laugh or two on their own... hard to take the relationships seriously when you could easily close your eyes and imagine a pre-pubescent teen telling his fourth grade crush the same silly things.There are a few things which might be of interest to Star Wars enthusiasts. Enjoying the expanded universe set forth by a myriad of authors and short film independent film creators I've come to enjoy watching or reading about the Star Wars galaxy unfold. While the performance was poor at best, this movie surely offers an on screen portrayal of the events which occurred in the Star Wars galaxy.Flawless at least as far as story goes? Certainly not, Palpatine's rise in the senate (which led many senators to clap in the movie) was absurd - I was expecting something more political, a better speech and some more evidence of the Jedi's so-called treachery against the average people of the galaxy... no such luck. Did he earn the support of the people before going against the Jedi council? Superficially, yes... and yet it could have been portrayed better. And yet I suppose in the end the younger audiences would have found such sci-fi politics boring.Gold contacts... plastic looking ships, angry lines which are spit out decently enough but ultimately sound as though a youngsters mentality was behind them... childish comedy and no sense of class leaves this movie, as well as the Episodes before it without any redeeming qualities. These prequels could have been and should have been so much more."	2.0	George Lucas Lost it! Watch it if nothing else is on.	2005-12-08	24	18	6
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1I9DQA9HCQKBR	Ashley Allinson	There is no doubt that Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith is the best film of the new trilogy. In fact, it far outweighs both Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones (Clones) in many ways. However, even groundbreaking CGI could not permit the third installment of the Star Wars saga to reach the heights of the original trilogy, due, in part to some fundamental changes in narrative.The opening scene of Episode 3 begins with an unbelievably detailed and exciting dogfight. The special effects could actually give someone motions sickness as optical points of view from the pilots, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), take us through countless twists and turns. However exciting this might be, it falls flat in terms of building suspense and then delivering, for at no point in Episode 3 does George Lucas allow the audience any sort of tension.Take for example Return of the Jedi. There is a great built up of tension as the audience watches the corralling of Imperial spacecraft waiting to fight off the rebel fleet's attack on the Deathstar. By jumping right into the middle of fight scenes, an Episode 3 staple, the engagement of the audience is isolated to payoff, transcending any notion of build up. Perhaps this has to do with the incredible amount of time, space and story Lucas had to make up to bring the plot up to speed with that of A New Hope. Regardless, this bereft delivery of action is less effective than in the past films.Another example of this lack of tension is the first lightsabre battle between Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) - the Sith Lord who fought-off both Obi-Wan and Anakin in Clones. He is now worked-over by Anakin within seconds of the opening credits. Anakin says his powers have improved since their last meeting, but this fight was a joke. The ever-ominous Dokku that we saw in Clones turned out to be a total pushover.And what about Anakin's step over to the Darkside? And if what I just said was a spoiler then you really need to catch up on your Star Wars. I mean, Anakin was forced to choose between Palpatine, the benevolent, dictatorial and power-thirsty leader of the feared Galactic Empire, and the Senate, who granted him a seat but not Master status.Palpatine wants to show Anakin the balance of both good and evil, subtextually working in tandem with the movie itself as a means of balancing the entire saga. Had Anakin's love, Padame (Natlie Portman) been killed, I could see his decent into darkness. However the brevity of his decision-making, staged like a sales meeting, was not believable. Again we must settle with the fact that Lucas had to bridge time and space to the detriment of story.Finally, there is Anakin's rise to power. It is surely an homage to Al Pacino's rise to power at the end of The Godfather, intercutting between mob hits as each nemesis is checked off the hit list. Anakin marks every Senate member of death as he ascends to power, leaving the craftiness of the masters to fend for themselves. Is the Darkside a critique of organized crime? More positive notes include the final duel between Yoda and Darth Sidious, by far the best lightsaber battles of any of the films. Intercutting between this fight and Anakin and Obi-Wan's final battle is one for the ages, lasting over 20 minutes. Truly amazing.Essentially, you will not be disappointed with Episode 3, not in the least. Just prepare yourself for the fact that you will be thrown right into the action as George Lucas must fit a whole lot of story into a short frame of time.	4.0	Too Much to Say...Too Little Time	2005-05-21	3	0	3

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2WX1UESDOLXRE	"Ashley Quinn ""Ash"""	"This film is everything that the Episodes I and II should've been. Yes, there is a slight cheese factor in this movie with some of the dialogue, although I would say that Lucas has significantly improved in that area. I watched in complete agony as Anakin Skywalker completed his transformation into Darth Vader; I knew it was inevitable, but I had no idea that the transformation would be so emotionally powerful. Another improvement is Christiansen (Anakin). While I had no problem with his perfomance in Episode II (some critics called it ""wooden"", I say it was perfect for the nature of his character), he shows a wider array of emotions in this. He's lost and confused, and the Dark Side is an emotional comfort, especially when he learns that it can save Padme from death.The film opens with a battle scene between the Republic and the Sith Lord and his apprentice, Count Dooku, who has kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine. The special effects in this scene are awesome; it's amazing to see an all out space battle between so many ships. Anakin and Obi Wan are sent to save Palpatine. There's a wicked light saber fight between Ani/Obi and Dooku, in which Obi Wan is injured, with Anakin ultimately slicing off Dooku's hands and holding two light sabers up to Dooku's neck. Palpatine hisses at Anakin to finish him. Anakin's not sure; it's not the Jedi way. But he does it anyway, becoming angry at himself for letting his emotions get away from him. Afterward, Anakin rejoins Padme (their wedding is still secret), who tells him the news of her pregnanacy. I love Anakin's face when she tells him-- he's happy, but worried, and not just for her but for himself. It's the kind of face a 15 year old boy would make when his 15 year old girlfriend says, ""I'm pregnant."" The story continues, with them keeping their love a secret, as well as keeping the fact that Anakin is the father of Padme's unborn baby a secret. Soon, Anakin is consumed with fear, waking up sweaty after having dreamt Padme died in childbirth. You really get a sense of their love for each other in this, their unbelievably strong love, which is the catalyst for all of Anakin's actions that will make you say, ""I can't believe he did that."" His love escalates into obsession and into fear. As most of us know, fear is the path to the Dark Side, as outlined by Master Yoda in Episode I. The pair attempt to keep the lines of communication open, but when Anakin pledges allegiance to Darth Sidious (with hopes of keeping Padme alive), the communication stops. Anakin is Darth Vader. And he didn't even need the suit or helmet to make it happen.I absolutely love this movie. I definitely want to see it again at the theater-- especially for the lava scene, in which Anakin and Obi Wan have that much-hyped light saber duel, which totally lives up to the hype times ten. What happens in this scene is intense, so intense that I actually cried. I wasn't the only one either; not only were other theater-goers boo-hooing, but Anakin himself even sheds a few tears throughout this movie, frustrated and confused with himself. He is his own worst enemy.The saga is complete now. I actually appreciate Episodes I and II even more now afer having seen Episode III. I refuse to pick a favorite. I'll take them all. I love the journey."	5.0	How far would go for the one that you love?	2005-05-19	12	11	1

""ok.""] and in sheer bulk of cgi, easily comparible to Sky Captain, but with a screenplay as laughable as Ed Woods Glen or Glenda, this feels much more like a very bad parody of the other movies, and honestly most parodys,including thumb wars, are at least twice as good. you can tell from the opening words scrolling down the screen that Lucas is doing a half assed job. and it doesnt help that everyone knows how it ends, and how does Georgie boy mix it up then? thats right, be making every single action sequence a badly edited and acted duplicate of the other movies, I didnt even bother to count the number of hands lost in this movie. yoda fights again, of course no one wanted to see him fight in the first place, but Lucas seems to enjoy seeing a digital green ball with a sword. I did not have many expectations for this, I just thought it would be better than episode 1 and 2, but even that was asking too much. I think the most depressing thing in the world is that this probably wont be nominated for a single Razzie even though it deserves a clean sweep, even sameul L and Natalie Portman deserve a nomination at the razzies, just for allowing themselves to become affiliated with such a terrible movie. Now if youll excuse me, I have to write to George demanding my $6.50 back from the most dissapointing midnight prmiere ive ever been to.One thing that really dissapoints me is how everyone says this is good, ""oh sure the acting is bad, but it's an Awesome movie, Its great!"" people really need to learn the difference between subjective opinion and fact. Example:Pulp Fiction, a very well made film often called horrible because it was violent, you should be able to admit a movie is good if you dont like it just like you can like a movie and still recognize that it was badly made, i think Bill and Ted was a funny movie, but I wouldnt call it a good movie, in fact it sucks. and I know it sucks, I admit it sucks, but I still enjoy it. So please, if you DID like this movie then just say you enjoy it, dont say its oscar worthy, or even good in general, the simple fact is, it is an extremely flawed, and dreadfully acted piece of film, and hopefully you're smart enough to realize that, even if you did like the movie"	1.0	I wish I were an idiot so I'd be able to enjoy this.	2005-05-22	55	21	34

In the end I felt like hopeless, confused and sad,  but well,  the whole movie will be a particular experience for each one. It was specially hard to hear Yoda say: I must go into exile, I failed.About acting, I only have two complaints: it's hard to understand how 'easy' was for Anakin to fall into the Dark Side, I mean it had to happen but I was expecting more fighting with himself before falling into darkness. Also more fight from the other Jedi, the are not so great like Obi-Wan but I think  we were expecting to be more difficult to defeat in fighting.	4.0	Stunning... it had to be that way	2005-05-23	4	2	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AHKP7P4T2QDU5	Aubrey Ward III	Not much to say about the plot because everyone already knows what happens. Anakin goes to the Dark Side thus becoming Darth Vader, Luke & Leia are born, Palpatine becomes Supreme Emperor of the new Empire, and the Jedi Order is almost fully exterminated. All the loose ends are now tied up and now Episodes 4-6 will be even more special because now we clearly know why there's a Rebellion fighting for freedom from an tyrannical Empire.Episode III is a great film. It reminded me of Empire Strikes Back where it's the bad guys turn to be the winner. There are a few hopeful endings but the overall tone of the film is tragic. It's just one loss after another. But that's the way the story goes. It was just pleasantly overwhelming to see history unfold. I dare say that seeing the birth of Darth Vader as well as the birth of the twins is equal to seeing the first Star Wars film. It's a major event as epic as the movie itself.Critics and fans alike will rip this film to shreds over a myriad of little petty things but despite all that Episode III is an amazing film that must be viewed in a theater to get the full experience. I hope that this is not the last Star Wars film to be produced because nothing compares to the George Lucas Experience....ok, except maybe Lord of the Rings, ha ha ha. See it twice.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AI46E73DWKD2B	BackToGood	"REVENGE OF THE SITH (2005) concludes the STAR WARS PREQUEL TRILOGY, a phrase that will go down in infamy! George Lucas opted to deviate from expectations based on the OT and cater to current movie trends: overuse of CGI, minimal character detail and development, using music to underscore EVERY scene and not letting the scene breathe and stand up on it's own. ROTS got the best reviews of the PT, but, frankly, I find it almost as unwatchable as the atrocious ATTACK OF THE CLONES. Again with ROTS, the CGI is allowed to dominate the action and there are literally no authentic set pieces or locales. There's an annoyingly fake quality to ROTS that I just can't overlook. The one thing that ROTS does (a bit) better than AOTC is that the love story of Anakin and Padme (admirably played by Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman) is somewhat more bearable (in particular, their first scene where Padme reveals her pregnancy, after Anakin returns from a mission, is quite endearing). The unbelievably unreal dialogue in AOTC sunk their story in that one, but in ROTS, while the dialogue is still generally too simplistic and clunky, at least here Christensen and Portman actually have chemistry!In addition to the aforementioned Portman and Christensen, all actors do the best that they can in ROTS. Ewan MacGregor fares well as Obi-Wan Kenobi as the makeup department did an awesome job of giving him a more mature, distinguished look as you can really imagine him morphing into Sir Alec Guinness' Obi-Wan look in the OT! Additionally, Sam Jackson (as Jedi leader Mace Windu) and Ian McDarmid (as Chancellor Palpatine) are solid in their roles. It's difficult to even trash the acting in the prequels due to how amazingly simple (not a compliment!) the dialogue is. I mean, even the greatest actors would have trouble selling Lucas' words!In addition to the ever-present CGI, the real killer of ROTS is the main plot point, which we all know is Anakin Skywalker's final descent into the Dark Side and becoming the full-fledged Sith Lord Darth Vader. The turn is so abrupt, unexpected (well, if you just go by the events of the movie!), and cheesily done that it plain does NOT ring true. It takes all of 5 minutes for him to turn! I mean, literally, a few minutes earlier, he was totally against Sidious and what he stood for and then...POOF...he's his greatest ally. Also, it annoys me that all of the subplots with Count Dooku, General Grievous, and the Separatist movement are rendered totally moot (and almost seemed unnecessary to begin with) as in the end, it's all about the Sidious' plan to rule the galaxy! And with all of his Separatist allies destroyed, exactly where did Sidious get his bottomless pit of loyal minions ready to go evil? Also, it's hard to fathom that the automaton clones in the PT morphed into being the ""human"" Stormtroopers in the OT. Other than the fact that the Stormtroopers wore the same uniforms, they actually seem like individuals, not clones!The final dual lightsaber duels (pardon the wordplay!) of Yoda-Sidious and Anakin-ObiWan come across as overdone, dizzying, and incoherent. Just a lot of quick movements, twirling, spinning, etc. Not to mention that all involved seem like there are actually points where they FLY. I didn't know Jedis could do that! While the last scenes of the doomed Anakin-Padme love story, the birth of Luke and Leia, the self-imposed exiles of Yoda and ObiWan, and the beginning of the Emperor-Vader reign are pretty heart-wrenching as it all comes full circle leading into the OT saga, it is the GETTING THERE that was a total fail!I still argue that THE PHANTOM MENACE, the first of the PT, is the best because it had the best plot (similar to the original STAR WARS), best heroes (Liam Neeson's Qui-Gonn Jinn being a standout), best villains (Darth Maul and his mentor Sidious, who started out as an enigma), best action scenes (cleverly blending live action, animation, and CGI), which include ""keeper"" scenes (the exciting podrace and final lightsaber duel), and has a memorable musical score (which I actually thought was Oscar-worthy). That said, TPM definitely had it's flaws, so that the subsequent prequel movies AOTC and ROTS could have improved upon TPM...They just didn't!"	2.0	Not how I imagined it	2011-03-19	3	2	1

I use powerdvd, although which player will be best for you will depend on your system I guess.The only real gripe I have is that what made the original star wars movies so good is that they were actually collaberative efforts.  George has taken too much control of everything and this has made some of the cheeziness that has entered some of the dialogue of the movie.  The same is true of this movie.  If the producer had only had some input, I think the deleted scene with Yoda would have been great (which is on the dvd btw).  Otherwise, it's a great special effects movie and the dvd's are loaded with extras.  Most poeple, I hope, that love star wars should not be dissapointed.	5.0	pretty good dvds	2005-11-12	5	2	3

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AE2G6FAHRHXJE	"Bart Simpson ""Dvd-Pro"""	"With Revenge of the Sith George Lucas has created a film that will finally meet the sky-high expectations of even the most diehard of fans of the 1977 original classic. The last two, although excellent in their own separate rites, were too much of an intellectual departure from the swashbuckling original to truly sate the palette of all you dress-up wookies and Vaders out there. But finally there is closure. And with this closure comes a rewind to the roots that made Star Wars the classic it is today. Essentially, Lucas makes Episode III his masterpiece by carefully tying together the strings left from the politics of Episode II and the swaggering adventure of Episode IV. It forms itself into a symphony finale, a space opera if you will, that ties together and intelligently completes a saga that follows a civilization's collapse, revolution, and destruction that spans the length of three generations and tells its story with harrowing, jaw-dropping excitement.The film opens with the rescue of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from the grips of the evil Separatist Federation star-ship caught in the midst of its escape. Heading up the rescue are Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen). Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) stills leads the Separatist movement in its as-of -yet successful attempts to divide the Republic. Second in command to Dooku is the aging droid General Grievous (voice of Matthew Wood), whose command of the lightsaber soon causes him to yield a stunning four weapons simultaneously (that's right, four lightsabers...way cool). After dealing with the situation with Chancellor Palpatine, the two Jedi return to Coruscant to discuss matters with the ever-faithful Jedi Council, led by the legendary Yoda (Frank Oz) and Master Windu (Samuel L. Jackson).Anakin is still secretly romantically involved with Senator Amidala (Natalie Portman), soon learning that she's pregnant with his son (and daughter for that matter). However, all this success certainly has its price. Anakin has been having prophecies (i.e. nightmares) that foreshadow the death of Amidala during childbirth. To stop the hand of fate, Anakin utilizes his newfound friend, the Chancellor, to help him find a way to save her.As in all the new Star Wars films, the level of sheer, meticulous detail in Revenge of the Sith is stunning. From John William's brilliantly nuanced score, to each of the many tiny insignias on every costume, to the multiple levels of sound effects and editing, to the greatly improved graphics and visuals, Episode III is a gold mine of sensory detail. But of course, I probably didn't need to tell you that. As usual, we're pulled so far into the Star Wars universe that we find ourselves sadly reluctant to leave.This time around, however, the world of Star Wars has gotten a fair bit darker. Lucas pops for the PG-13 rating in return for the chance to successfully illustrate the Clone Wars in full detail. We're treated to a myriad of action sequences involving good-ole dogfights, chase sequences, and epic warscenes between the droids and the Jenga-Fett based Clone Soldiers. There's essentially a lot more action in Episode III. I use the word ""more"" in the sense that the violence has less of a base in politics and more of a base in adventure. The fights now go back to roots. Think of the good old lightsaber duels and dogfights between X-wings and A-wings, where the fights were campier, nerdier, and best of all, geekier.Because although Revenge of the Sith really is the darkest of all the films, Lucas manages to steer it back to the classic science fiction roots it began with. But that's not to say that Anakin's slow, painful turn to the dark side is any less tragic. In fact, the reason for the PG-13 rating is less because of the war sequences, but more because of Anakin's disturbing metamorphosis into the villain we all love to hate, Darth Vader. He performs his fall out of his love for Padme Amidala, not just out of pure villainous hate. This makes the deterioration into something of a Greek tragedy, creating some truly powerful scenes between Anakin and his master Obi-Wan, who's raised him in the Jedi arts since he was a little boy back in Episode I.Star Wars was originally a success because it sketched an entire universe out of a simple Japanese legend and molded it into a pulp science fiction symphony of the highest form. The prequels have damaged this image a tad, not really injuring the film's reputation, but more shifting it towards intellectual and political realms that were originally overlooked. But now Revenge of the Sith ties the two sides of the saga together, mixing adventure with politics, and allowing us to finally see and fully appreciate the entire picture; the supreme masterpiece that lurked in Lucas' mind for decades which has now brought itself to full universal splendor in the hearts and minds of every science fiction geek who's nerd enough to watch it. I believe Revenge of the Sith is a fitting end to what has been a long and arduous journey for the saga. It's easily superior to the latest two films and on par with the quality of the originals. Yes, it's really that great."	5.0	Star Wars Is Getting Better	2005-07-27	3	2	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AKHP38ZBW5DRK	Basil Khamis	"Unlike all the other Star Wars where we would find out something new, be introduced to someone new or witness a twist of events this one had none.We all knew Anakin would become Darth Vader & is Luc's father & we knew the Sith were going to win no matter what. So what's new? Nothing. My point exactly.This movie was made to serve a purpose & the purpose being to link between the classic trilogy & the modern ones. Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back & Return of the Jedi were all classics, masterpieces, ahead of their time etc... the downward trend started with The Phantom Menace and is now at the lowest point.Unlike the past episodes where emphasis was on the characters' personality & charisma, down to earth dog fights & a constantly exhilarating story line this had none. Lucas turned this into a big budget Soap Opera with special effects (you realize I am referring to the lovey-dovey dialogue scenes between Padme and ""Annie"") this is not Star Wars.Well the good thing is that we did not expect much; the first two episodes were below par & hence we assumed this would be close to them in ""suckability"" and we were right.As for the camera-work, the graphics etc... they were what you would come to expect from a 21st century Sci-fi movie so I can't say much about that although I did secretly hope and pray that their would be something in the movie to change my mind but it was not to happen; sigh... c'est la vie.I would think die-hard Star Wars fans would probably be split in two distinct groups right now; those who feel betrayed by the last 2-3 episodes & those who think Lucas is an icon  for all things sci-fi and are still perplexed on the whole evil-good issue with Darth Vader & ""Annie"" - I like the name Annie!!! No wonder he left for the dark side. The most powerful Jedi of them all & his name is ""Annie"", no wonder he hides behind that mask.On a serious not; I can't say I am disappointed because I sort of expected the out come, so if you've got 3 hours to spare go watch it, don't forget the Coke & the Pop corn it makes it a tad more watch-able."	2.0	No Surprises...

Bauman	Though the prequal trilogy is often disliked by fans of the original trilogy, even these fans must appreciate this end to an epic saga.  Unlike many people, I enjoyed Episodes I and 11.  They had more action, and the lightsaber duel(Maul vs. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan) whih is second only to the Mustafar battle.  Episode III has the great plot everyone loved from the originals and the action that made me enjoy the new episodes.  I can easily say the best parts are the final lightsaber duel on Mustafar, R2D2's fight scene with the super battle droids, the wookie army, and the fact that Jar-Jar Binks is only there for two seconds (Really, I counted!).  It successfully brings the two sagas together, filling in all the gaps.  I highly recomnd this to both fans of the new and old trilogies.	5.0	Revenge of the Sith Surpasses its Predesessors	2005-11-19	8	1	7

Darrow ""hulkfanatic"""	"Ok, first off I am giving this film 4 stars because it WAS much better then the last 2,(but, in the long run, that isn't saying much.)  Plus, most of the action scenes wewre pretty cool.  The acting was ok,(especially Ewan & Ian.)  The loves scenes with Padme & Anakin are still forced, for sure,(especially when they're on a balcony & he says, ""You're beautiful...""well, if you've seen the movie you know the scene.)  Plus, there are SO many inconsistencies in this movie it isn't funny.  Now, I KNOW I'm going to get the wrath of God for writing the bad points of Revenge Of The Sith, but, I don't care.  First of all, how does R2-D2 have all these new powers, like flying, or burning up droids?  Plus, if the Jedi are so wise, how come they don't know that the Chancellor is the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious?  That whole explination in AOTC's where Dooku says, ""the Dark Suide of the Force has clouded their vision, my friend"" doesn't cut it.  Also, in that same regard, if they can see things before they happen, how come they were so easily killed off?  Also, how come someone falls to their death when in AOTC's Anakin can fly through the air...yes, with the greatest of ease, haha?  Also, if they,(Mace & The Emperor,)are fighting by an open window, does George not understand about gravity?  Especially since, VERY earlier in the film, when a window was blow to bits, people were pulled towards the open window, due to...gravity.  Plus, when the Jedi ARE killed off, as someone said earlier, those scenes are pretty unspectatular.  They were done so fast, it's like George almost did that as an afterthought to the rest of the film.  Plus, when Palpatine changes from the Chancellor to the Emperor, even the most faithful Star Wars fan ought to die from laughing.  Also, the whole ""Arise Lord Vader"" scene was spoiled, thanks to the teaser.  So, that was pretty unspectacular,(it would have been unspectacular even without it being shown in the teaser.)  Also, along the lines of Darth Vader, I wasn't fully convinced of Anakin's downfall.  Yes, in AOTC's we saw Anakin kill Tusken Raiders, & he DOES kill lots of people in this movie, but, I wish that they would have spent more time on his downfall from Jedi to Sith on a more pyshcological level.  I HAVE seen the movie 3 times, so, the ""NO!"" line, even though it seems uncharacteristic of Darth Vader, doesn't cause laughter anymore.  As someone told me, you have to remember, he is STILL mostly Anakin, & that was the last of his humanity dying.  I just hope that, when they make the TV show, they make him into the Vader we all love.  You know, the most iconic villian of all time, not crying over losing his beloved.  But, I admit to getting chills when the mask is being put on & you first hear Vader breathing.  Anyway, despite my misgivings of the film I STILL cannot wait for the movies release on Nov. 1st to complete my Star Wars DVD collection.  Plus, I have to admit, it was cool seeing how everything falls into place.  But, in my opinion, not as ""neatly"" as some would want you to believe."	4.0	Inconsistencies abound	2005-08-14	12	2	10

Pfiester	"I really tried to like Episode 1-III, but they failed on so many levels from title's, character development, dialogue, and special effects, that I will run out of space on this page!Episode III looked promising from the previews, however, so did Anchorman!  This movie fails from the infamous opening, where a brief description of the movie horizontally scrolls across the screen.War! is the first word we read.  I thought Episode III was supposed to be about the creation of Darth Vader, whom is omitted from the opening credits.The opening battle scene looks like one of those ""cut scenes"" from a PC game.  All you see are bursts of colors from lazer beams, and fighters everywhere.  It's like they are trying to recreate the scene from Return of the Jedi when there are dozens of Tie Fighters coming after Lando in the Falcon.Not even the talented Natalie Portman can save this fiasco.  That really says something when the best actress on the screen has trouble being convincing!Even the title of the movie (Revenge of the Sith) just sounds force fed.  Return of the Jedi was a clever name for Episode VI.  George Lucas took a lot of heat over the names of the 1st 2 movies, you think he'd put a little more thought into this one!True Star Wars fans will always wait in line to be harassed by Triumph the Insult Comic Dog.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A44L1371VP728	Ben Klenke	"Where has the time gone? It's amazing to think that for better or worse I've been influenced someway of another by Star Wars my whole life. I've never formally written a review of any of the six movies. Not that I haven't tried, but it always seemed to difficult to sort out all the feelings and thoughts in my head into a proper paragraph or two of review.That being said this is my first, and probably last review of Star Wars.(This review contains spoilers)Revenge of the Sith is an outstanding movie, and not just in Star Wars terms. It carries a depth and emotion that transcends the screen into the viewers mind and imagination. The movie is very fast paced, the fastest of all six films. I feel the need to see it several more times just to take it all in, but I've said that before on these films.The opening space battle is visually breathtaking, and has some excellent dialogue with Anakin and Obi-Wan that reminded me a bit of some Han/Luke exchanges in 4,5, and 6.In fact, let me just for the record put this in writing. This movie has the best drama driven dialogue of all six films. I've never bought into the ""wooden"" acting that supposedly haunts the prequels. It doesn't exist. It's the same dialogue in 4,5, and 6. It is fantasy dialogue, not real world dialogue. There, end of rant.Count Dooku gets very little screen time before he is beheaded by Anakin (nice touch with the dual sabers). He does get a good one in on Obi-Wan. Apparently Obi-Wan just doesn't know how to fight this guy.The films only lull in pacing occurs after the Courescant battle, where Lucas needs to setup the chess pieces so to speak in their right areas. This period in the film does give some excellent screen time to Ian McDiarmid to further the ever threatening Palpatine.Visuals on the film hit the mark everywhere. There are an orgy of lightsaber battles, the best is Obi and Anakin and Sidious and Yoda. I've already written too much, but here is a list of great things I loved:The Jedi Temple raid: AWESOME! Lucas proves that just implying violence is as effective if not more so than showing bloody carnage ala Kill Bill. The youngling slaughter gave me chills!C-3PO gets his memory wiped, but R2 doesn't! He knows everything! What a great revelation!Yoda in every second he occupies this film is fantastic!Order 66 montage. Another chill moment !Padme dying because she lost the will do live. Very good Shakespearean angle.Anakin's burning scene. Man that was intense!Anakin's birth into the suit juxtaposed with Luke and Leia's birth. Brilliant work!Vader breaking off the table like Frankenstein, too cool.These are just the few that pop right to mind. Yes, my fanboy eyes got wet during this movie... oh hell, I was mush from Padme's choking scene onward, but isn't that what Star Wars is all about. To move you?One final segment. I've been asked this question more than any other... what is you favorite Star Wars movie? As a child I couldn't say Return of the Jedi fast enough. In my teens that phrase was replaced by Empire Strikes Back. I can honestly say, without any doubt, that because of the last three movies (Menace, Clones, Sith) I no longer have a favorite. That is probably the greatest compliment I could ever give to George Lucas and his movies. They all are important, mythical, moving, and fun as hell to watch.I can't picture Star Wars and not see Qui-Gon tending to Anakin's cuts, Padme and Anakin in a lover's kiss, or Luke staring out into that twin sunset, wondering what his destiny is. Star Wars has meant many things to me at many different times, but there is never a day that goes by that I'll regret saying I am a Star Wars fan.So, as a wise man once said, the force will be with you... always.Rating: ***** (A+)"	5.0	We end where we begin...	2005-12-02	7	4	3

George, you out did your self, and in the process you regained your reputation. Thank God. I thought that the choppy, stiff and down right bad Episode I and the not-so-choppy, still stiff, and a bit better Episode II threw the name of Star Wars into the mud. After the original three made me a big fan, the first two prequels scared me. I thought that they were crap, and Star Wars would never be the same. This movie saved it, and Thank God it did. I'll admit some parts don't flow, but the fights and the unraveling of Palpatine's plot were extremely well done, in my opinion. To see Palpatine's rise to power, who in my opinion, has always been the real bad guy, was more than I expected. The fall of Anakin Skywalker didn't interest me as much, probably because of the stubborn and boring acting. However, the action took the movie industry to new heights, the acting of Ian McDiarmid, and the overall story of this movie made me proud to say ""I am a Star Wars fan"" once again!

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AG5XM49AZVIYH	"Ben ""Pizza Enthusiast"""	Lets start back at episode I. Jar Jar gets on everyones nerves and we have to listen to Kwi Gon explain everything to young Anakin, even though the audience already knows everything he's babbling about.Episode II: Though just as boring at some parts with the whole love thing going on with Anakin and Padme, it is a much better movie than Episode I because the action keeps things interesting.Episode III. This one is the best. It starts out with an exciting space fight and there is a lot less slowing the movie down. The whole movie kept me interested. Though Anakin turning to the dark side so quickly was surprising, I can see how it happened.What I was disappointed with was the end of the battle between Mace Windu and the Emperor. I knew what had to happen, yet Mace Windu had the Emperor on his back and against a wall, defenseless. He wastes about 5 minutes rubbing victory in the Emperor's face and well... you get the picture. Emperor wins. That was the only part I thought was written poorly (Mace should have killed him and there wouldn't be any reason for Episodes IV V and VI). I also wish they would have shown more jedi temple and Kashyyyk action.The ending showdown was definitely a high point. Anakin and Obi Wan battling was about as far from disappointing as you can get (I dont know what some of the other reviewers are talking about) and the emperor taking on Yoda was also good, though I was left wondering why Yoda didnt use the force to get his lightsaber and keep fighting. I also thought it funny that what Anakin was seeing in his dreams was the consequence of going to the dark side. If he had ignored his dreams nothing would have gone wrong. But overall, this is one of my favorites, probably beating out all but episode IV and V.	4.0	Without a doubt the best of the prequels.	2006-03-28	3	2	1

Evil dominates this movie and the performances by the actors are very solid. The movie is very moving, gut-wrenching and exciting. Every scene has a purpose and the film is solid from top to bottom.The dialogue, which never was and will never be a focal point, actually is engaging. But the focus of Revenge of the Sith is the VISUALS that tell the story and it sticks by the original formula Lucas conceived years ago. MUSIC and VISUALS are what's important in these films.

""The Phantom Menace"" seemed more aimed toward the younger audiences where the plot had no real significance to the Saga beyond the finding of Anakin Skywalker. ""Attack of the Clones"" was overall better,but was very slow-paced and had only momentary action. The Original Trilogy was great, but had several side plots just to extend the movies, slowing it down. ""Revenge of the Sith"", however, has action all throughout the movie keeping you at the edge of your seat, with plot twists that will keep you very interested.""Revenge of the Sith"" does have its share of problems though. Continuity is slightly flawed here, with the unexplained reason why the Clone Troopers' helmets being changed and the droids having higher-pitched voices than the previouse two films. Count Dooku played a very inportant role in ""Episode II"", and I wish it could be so in this one, but it is not as Anakin kills him very quickly early on in the film. After watching the ""Star Wars: Clone Wars Animated Micro-Series"" I expected General Grievous to be the ultimate ""Star Wars"" villain, but it turns out, he was just and over-confidant pushover that could have been left out of the film.The rest of the film though is great and easily makes up for the flaws ad so much more.

My opinion is that this is much better than the first two prequels. I'm telling you, the end is going to totally take you back 30 years and make you remember why you fell in love with this saga. Because that's what it is now, a saga. Loose ends are tied up from the originals, the action sequences are spectacular, the special effects are the best ever seen before, but if you're expecting General Grievous to steal the show, he doesn't, he's not in it all that much. When he is in it though, WOW, very original character. Yoda is all I have to say on this one. He steals the show again. To tell you the truth The Emperor and Yoda steal the show. This movie gives insight as to why the Emperor is the Emperor. The best thing to do though is go see this for yourself, don't listen to these reviews because it's all based on opinions. My opinion is that it's better than the first two prequels.	4.0	Better than the first two......	2005-05-19	8	5	3

Ever since I can remember my sister and I would always watch the originals in the livingroom nonstop. Now with the new trilogy I got to experience the same as the kids of the 70's and 80's. The modern effects won me over, not that I'm opposed to the effects created by Lucas back in the day but its more my generation. Anyway this movie blew me away when i went to see it. The action is crazy, its emotional, and its the missing key that ties the two trilogies. But it's a hard decision to decide if this movie is the best of all or is it episode 6.

Sure, it leaves some things in the air (how Leia remembers Padme, etc) but I like that it leaves the little things up to your own imagination.  The story was well written, no 'yippees' or other iffy dialouges.  Don't get me wrong, I loved Episodes I and II.  Anyone who is a TRUE fan of Star Wars loves ALL the movies.  If you love the taste of orange juice, how could you not like the taste of orange?!The acting was superb, heavy emotions that make you feel for the character.  You could feel the chemistry between Hayden and Natalie, between Hayden and Ewan, and between Hayden and Ian.  Hayden did an excellent job and Ewan, like always, did an amazing job.  Natalie also did good...even if she didn't, her good looks make up for it.  Ian has always done a extremely good job at bringing Palpatine to life as the man in the chair that talks and acts very political.  Now he brings even more to the character as Palpatine gains the throne, wields a saber, and turns even more spooky.As for Vader's ""Nooooo!"" at the end of the movie...well wouldn't you scream 'nooooo!' if you just found out that you caused the woman you truly loved, who was your everything, your heart, day, noon, and night to die.  I know I would.  Any NORMAL human being would (except for film appreciation teachers, it seems.) In conclusion, I say that Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith was truly worth my money, and cannot wait for the DVD release in November.  It truly was a heart-pounding, intense movie that made me, along with everyone in the theater at the end applaud and cheer...not a boo-er or sit-downer in the crowd.  A great film that deserves great respect.By the way, Amazon.  I have to agree with 'Mr. Professor' on this one:  You do need to change your rating system to include more stars!

Tarkin (played by Peter Cushing in film one) is apparently introduced at the end with a younger lookalike actor in a dialogue-free bit role. The thing is I always though Tarkin was only acquainted with Vader long after the latter and Kenobi quit being friends. I feel Tarkin showing up at the end was unnecessary as he was really a forgotten character from film one and he was only so important to begin with anyway. Just seeing those guy in greyish-green Peter Pan-like outfits around Vader looking at the completing Death Star at the film's end was good enough to foreshadow A New Hope. Tarkin unneeded! I feel they did say earlier in the film no more droids so at the film's end when the empire is now going to use just mostlky non-force ridden humans to run the empire that it explains why the 70's and 80's SW films were less advanced looking in technology than the prequels.	3.0	About the film's ending (spoiler)	2005-07-11	9	1	8
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A25HYPL2XKQPZB	Bill Garrison	I'm not enough of an expert to comment extensively on this movie and its context with in the series.  But I enjoyed episode 3 as Anakin slowly turns to the dark side as he believes it is truly the only way he can save Padme from death in child birth.At times, the plots from episode 1 and 2 seemed to be bogged down in political details.  This movie is straight forward and easy to understand.  My favorite part of the movie was Hayden Christianson.  As other reviewers have mentioned, he is very good at the evil Darth Vader.  He easily lets his anger take over as he is manipulated by the Chancellor into believing the dark side offers the only hope of saving Padme.As the movie concluded, I was thinking how exciting it would be to continue the story while realizing that is what Episode IV does.  I think its good that Star Wars was already made because if Episode IV were to be made today, it would be overloaded with special effects and miss out on the great story.  Episode 3 is the payoff for watching 1 & 2.  To me, the story of 1-3 could have been told in one epic film.	4.0	A fun movie, Darth Vader is born	2006-04-14	2	0	2

The elements are there... but Lucas blows it.The Sith finally reveal themselves.  They are going to control the galaxy by a clone army.  Wow.  That makes the original Star Wars a lot more interesting if this fact could be used.However, Lucas has grown weak in the force.  His directing style is off key.  The action, such as with the battles with General Grevious, feels faked and computer controlled.  Grevious should stop smoking so as to get rid of that stupid hack.Then there is Vader.  Sob.. sniff.. sniff..  Lucas should be horse whipped for taking a perfect bad guy and making it into somebody who is a whinner.  Spencer Tracy gave advice to Burt Reynolds ""Don't let them see you act.""  The ""actor"" (I'm loathe to mention his name) has a look like you just beat him in a video game.Also, I want to know how people with faster-than-light space travel and advanced robotics can't do any more for a pregnant woman than was done in the early 1900s.  Can we all say ""hole in the plot"" together?Bad acting is all through this movie.  Samuel L. Jackson, a wonderful actor, looks wooden.  This banal script would put you in a daze.Buy the video.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1EJ6J6N9I7W35	Billy Hollis	"There's plenty to like in this movie, but also some things that just didn't come together. Let's start with the positive.The action scenes are superb. These are best Jedi battle scenes yet done, and all of them have fantastic detailed visualizations as a backdrop. The entire movie just feels incredibly rich in visual detail, in fact.A fully CGI Yoda finally looked completely natural in this movie. In re-watching the original trilogy after seeing this, I found myself wishing that Lucas would go back to the old movies and insert a CGI Yoda. It is that much better.The conclusion brings the entire series together. The parts that concerned Padme were a tad bit rushed, but otherwise there was little to criticize. The minimalist treatment of the transformation of a burned Anakin into a helmeted dark lord was completely different from the rest of the movie, and somehow struck exactly the right chord. The rest of the ending is extremely well done - the bequesting of the children and the droids, the scenes on the Bail Organa's ship (which is the first ship seen in episode 4), and the tie-in of Qui Gon Jinn.But not everything was ideal. Lucas just doesn't write scintillating dialog, but then we all expected that. The biggest flaw to me was the unconvincing final conversion of Anakin to the dark side. It's just too easy to ask yourself ""How could he be that stupid?"", and that spoils the so-called willing suspension of disbelief that a movie needs.The political scenes were rushed, probably because the movie was already too long and the youngsters in the audience don't care about such stuff anyway. But I missed them - they were handled much better in the book.The scenes between Anakin and Padme worked only a bit better than in Episode 2 (where they bordered on silly). Hayden Christensen just can't seem to bring off the romance scenes.With the superb visualizations and the connections of the old trilogy with the new, this is a must-have for Star Wars fans. For casual viewers, it may not be worth the money, but for those of us, who grew up on Star Wars, it's a vital part of our DVD collection. I'm looking forward to getting it on November 1."	4.0	Good: Great battles, satisfying conclusion. Bad: Lame dialog	2005-08-27	9	7	2

The Phantom Menace is my least favorite of six, but I still think it is better than a lot of movies out there. Attack of the Clones is better, and I liked the complex plot surrounding Count Dooko which I thought was something different for Star Wars. It isn't that these movies are bad, it is that they didn't live up to expectations. People went to Episode 1 expecting the greatest movie ever made, and it wasn't that. It wasn't even the greatest Star Wars movie made to date.  It was just a pretty good movie, and I enjoyed it. So that being said, Revenge of the Sith is right up there with the original three. Whatever complaints people may have had with the first two should be quelled here. The emotional impact is amazing. Even knowing what will happen, I still found myself feeling upset seeing Anakin turn. And that is a compliment to the first two as well as this one. It took those first two movies to get me emotionally invested in Anakin's character so that when he made those fatal decisions in episode 3, I felt the disapointment.	5.0	Best of the prequels, and one of the best of the six.	2006-04-03	8	4	4

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A311HBNQ5OBFDB	B. K. MORTON	This was certainly the most intense of the six movies.  Granted, the droids and General Grevious were rather... cartoonish.  That, and the characters of Watto and Jar Jar Binks (thankfully not in this one, or at least kept in the background) tended to kill the credibility of the first two movies.But this one Had to be intense.  This is the Big One - the movie that brings everything together, and (supposedly) answers all the questions. (Although I still don't know who the Whills were.)  Let's face it, folks - it's tough to build suspense when everybody knows how it's going to end.  There is plenty of action, to be sure, but it's also very heavy on drama - even moreso than The Empire Strikes Back, which is saying a lot.I remember back in the '70s (or was it the '80s?) Lucas said something to the effect that one of the reasons he started with Episode IV (other than the fact that CGI hadn't been invented yet) was that Episodes I-III were heavy on character development, rather than action, and that he felt audiences weren't ready for that yet.With some of the reactions to these movies, he seems to have been right.	4.0	Intense	2005-06-08	4	1	3

Awesome special effects, great costumes, and some great scenes.  However, the big flaw with the film is the main character.  Hayden Christensen is a HORRIFIC actor.  Probably one of the worst leading men I have ever seen in a movie of this scale. Instead of coming across as a powerful cunning Jedi, he looks like a drummer in a boy band that plays in cheap bars. He has no screen presence at all, yet he was tasked with carrying the movie for most part.  His character is incredibly important, so why did they choose a lightweight like him?  He's surrounded by some great actors (Samuel Jackson, Natalie Portman, etc.), but all that does is highlight his horrible acting. There was an important romance story in the movie that involves Christensen and Portman.  Very important to the Star Wars story.  Yet, he and Portman have zero chemistry.  None, nada, zip.  You look at their characters and the first thing that comes to mind is, how can a sophisticated intelligent woman like Padme be attracted to this simple minded dullard named Anakin Skywalker?  Ewan McGregor should have been Anakin Skywalker.  You would have had a completely different movie.** SPOILERS AHEAD ** There are also some problems I had with the plot.  Anakin's transition from hero to villain was way too quick and unconvincing.  Of course, a decent actor would have helped here.  One second he's ready to help arrest Darth Sidious, the next scene he's ready to massacre Jedi ""younglings"".  Doesn't make a lot of sense. It just happened a little too rapidly.  Another glaring plot failure is how Padme dies.  She loses the will to live because her heart is broken at the thought of Anakin turning to the dark side.  Huh?  Are you kidding me?  I'm sorry, but a woman who just gives birth to twins has plenty to live for.  Anakin was more important to her than her kids?  Come, on.  That is in stark contrast to the level headed caring person that they built up Padme to be during the three films.  It's a total plot failure.  It would have made more sense that she die of wounds received from Anakin when he attacked her.  Much more sense. These things certainly hurt movie, but it did not sink it entirely.  There were enough good things here that I can still recommend the movie.  The light saber dual's were terrific.  The epic battle between Sidious and Yoda was amazing.  There's still plenty here to get your money's worth."	3.0	Could have been great.  Missed opportunity.	2011-09-20	4	3	1

The first 2 movies were a joke but Lucas manages to capture a little bit of the spirit of the original Star Wars trilogy with a satisfying conclusion. (or beggining). The acting was a bit improved over the last 2.

What about that scene in which Yoda touched down on Dagobah?  Yeah, it should have broken your heart to see that one get cut.  And it should have been longer!  If Peter Jackson can get away with making a masterpiece like Return of the King so long, then it would have been ok to lengthen this film just a bit more.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com"""	"There's always a sense of releif and sorrow when you come to the end of a journey. For this newest trilogy, the relief is in the form of finally seeing Darth Vader fully revealed, and the sorrow is in how quickly this was achieved. Now I have to admit that there's a time limit that moviegoers allow film makers to get their points across; but fans (at least from my perspective) rate a film by how effectively you accomplish this. Let me explain:We all knew that Anakin would become Darth Vader, we just weren't sure exactly how and when this would happen. Those of us who've been following his rise through the Jedi ranks knew it would come in this film (we drooled, mentally, over this coming transformation, dark pessimists that we are). But the cross over to the dark side came so abruptly (""I turn myself over to you, Lord."") that we -- I -- felt pretty let down.Why was all this film time spent on General Grievous, a character who came and went in this one film, and we never hear from again?Why did we have to visit the Wookie homeworld? Did it add anything to the movie? In my opinion, no. Couldn't they have spent more time on those characters we came to know and love and not on those that we never see again or only see again fleetingly?Okay, so I've told you what I DIDN'T like about the tranformation, now let me tell you what I did enjoy. We all knew that Obi-Wan and Anakin would have their saber duel in this film, and Mr. Lucas doesn't let us down. As soon as Anakin spies Obi-Wan on a transport ship that's landed on a volcanically active planet, everyone in the audience knew, just KNEW!, that the battle was coming. The psychological set up was nicely played up. And then, as the battle comes to a close, we get to see the physical transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader... and a bit more psychological trauma added to Darth's psyche by the Emperor. Awesome.Even though there are problems with the ""hurry up and finish it"" style of filming and plotting that plagued the end of the movie, I'm glad I saw it on the big screen. It is by far the best of the new trilogy.(P.S. I didn't mention Padme, Natalie Portman, because she just didn't stand out as a strong character in my mind. She's just the mother of Luke and Leah, and dies because ""she lost the will to live."" Well I lost the will to talk about this character as soon as I saw that.

Disguised in this movie is a brilliant political statement about the world we live in.  The leader you think is good has a way of blinding the young and uninformed to believe his way is the right way and you are fighting a good and just battle when in fact, the rest of the galaxy sees you as a rising Evil Empire.Then with the massacre of the Jedi and their younglings because of their religion; it reminded me of world history.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1JUGQ8IQRW5MA	boldsworthington	"*Star Wars* -- finished at last! And not a moment too soon: Mr. Lucas seems to have run low on engrossing ideas here and filled in the gaps with formulaic froth. A prime example is the excessive number and length of lightsaber duels -- way too many *High Noon* showdowns. These battles turn ""old"" and tedious *really* fast. After all, how many different and interesting ways can you take a whack at someone?While we're in battle territory, I'd like to raise a point I've not seen discussed elsewhere. Granted, we're in Fantasyland, where folks have extraordinary powers. But even fantasy must follow certain rules of plausibility to persuade us to suspend consensus-reality beliefs. So how on Earth (or off) could Anakin and Obi-Wan breathe all those noxious volcanic vituperations toward film's end, all the while expending the respiratory energy of 10 men -- not to mention surviving temperatures that should have turned them into burnt pork rinds at an altitude of a thousand feet? Yet here they are, rafting like fireproof demons through vast rivers of high-speed lava! I don't care if they *are* Jedi. The episode is exciting but physiologically absurd. Anakin doesn't start burning until he hits the edge of the lava pool? He and Obi-Wan should have vaporized long before that! (And no, I don't think invoking the protective powers of The Force offers a satisfying explanation for how all this lethal gas and thermal overload fail to kill them both.)I'm glad I saw this film, but having revisited the first trilogy just before seeing *Sith*, I find that on balance, the *Sith* characters are almost never as deeply engaging. Only the Emperor (the magnificent Ian McDiarmid) has bearing and (evil) allure comparable to those found in the first trio. If I like Obi-Wan, it's mainly because I adore Ewan McGregor.The biggest contrast between *Sith* and the first trilogy? The new film lacks the spirit of sheer fun that helped make the first trio so irresistible. I realize that this latest episode tells a naturally darker tale. But under all the fast and furious action lies a plot far too weak to offer ample support. (Was Lucas so preoccupied with cramming in all the setups for Episode IV that the foundations of the story just broke down under the weight?)And let's face it: Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen just can't bear the mythic freight that their prominent parts demand. I wanted to like them more than I did. But I just didn't care a whole lot about what was happening to them. (How different from the intense caring inspired by the fates of Luke, Leia, Chewy, and Han --  not to mention the droids!) They seemed like little more than puppet stand-ins. I found little regal depth in Natalie's ex-queen, and her anguish inflicted only superficial wounds on my heart. Nor is Hayden the larger-than-life hero who could credibly flip inside out to become Darth Vader. To transform convincingly into someone so grandly bad, he first must be as grandly good -- and he is that only in the script, not on the screen.Frankly too, I liked Yoda better as a puppet. He had a certain charm now forever lost in some black hole of cyberspace animation. Seeing his CGI self whipping around is cartoonishly ridiculous in the extreme (the backward somersaults look especially silly).Maybe everything will feel different when I can see all six films strung together. On second thought, maybe not. In any event, I still love to visit Lucas's world (the cityscapes in *Sith* are magnificently imagined and realized), and that means taking in all of what remains, all in all, an amazing imaginary creation.I'll close with a few of the visual echoes I noticed (you'll probably think of others):* The great chariot race from *Ben-Hur* (I refer to Obi-Wan on his giant chameleon [or whatever lizardy thing that was] chasing General Grievous in his ""rollover rover"" [my name; we'll have to wait for the DVD behind-the-scenes bonus disc to find the official name for that one!]).* Multilevel urban air traffic as in *The Fifth Element*.* More westerns than you can shoot with two Colt .45s and a rifle full o' buckshot."	3.0	Not as much fun as the first three, but worth seeing	2005-06-02	6	3	3

We owned the original movies on video, and whenever my older brother popped one of them in, I would sit down and watch it with him.  I liked watching them, but I don't think I really started to enjoy them until probably about a year after the ""Phantom Menace"" came out.We all know the plot by now, blah, blah, blah.  And you know what?  The movie actually is not that bad.Don't listen to the people who say this is a bad movie.  It is what it is, you can't change it, so stop complaining.  Anyway, about the acting.  Yes, there are some cheesy lines, ""From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.""(What's up with that?).  And all Natalie Portman gets to do is worry about Anakin, despite her great acting talents.  Though, I liked her reaction at the the end when she finds out Anakin has turned to the Dark Side.  I don't think the acting is wooden.  Blame George Lucas and his dialogue writing!To distract us from the bad dialogue, old George bombards us with special effects.  And that is a-ok with me.  It looks pretty comvincing to me.The fight scenes are awesome!  Lightsabres abound.  I can't believe somebody would say the fights are boring.  If you think those lightsabre dual scenes are boring, I'd like to see you go do them.  The Mustafar battle was awesome!  I loved the ""Battle of the Heroes"" song that plays during the scene.

The main complaint that I hear about this triology is that ""it is nothing like the first, there's no story line, the acting sucked,"" blah, blah, blah.Well, of course this is not like the first triology.  It isn't supposed to be like the first triology.  It tells a different story that is connected to the one within the first Star Wars triology.  The second trilogy is about how Anakin is found and how he is manipulated by evil, which is excellently captured by the character of Palpatine, into turning to the dark side.  Anakin is quick to anger and fears the loss of those he loves (his mother and Padme).  Anakin allows himself to be used by Palpatine.  He ignores the people who truly care for him and listens only to the counsels of Palpatine.  This explains why and how he becomes Darth Vader.  When a person only listens to advice from a person who is evil, manipulative, guileful, hateful, and wants power so much that they will use anyone to get it, then you yourself will become that person and take on the same qualities.  You really see Anakin's faults and how Palpatine uses them in Episodes II and III.For those of you who hated Episode I, suck it up and watch it again without a critic's eye.  Episode I expertly portrays the relationship between Obi'wan and Quigon'Jinn.  It show how Anakin is discovered and how Obi'wan was wary of Anakin and only agreed to be the boy's mentor because of a promise he made to his teacher.  This undoubtedly had an affect on the relationship between Obi'wan and Anakin.  Then there is Episode II which shows how Obi'wan has grown to love and care about Anakin and how Anakin drives Obi'wan crazy because he won't listen to him.  If Obi'wan seems cranky he has good reason.  Think about it.  If a person you care about will not listen to you, it drives you nuts.  You see Anakin's tendecy to blame other people for his problems and to get angry at those who care about him.  Anakin blames Obi'wan for his mother's death, even though it's not his fault.  He is very defiant and will not listen to Obi'wan or Yoda who try to help him by telling him what he needs to hear, the truth.Episode III provides a good finish for how Anakin becomes Darth Vader.  You see how strong of a hold Palpatine has on Anakin.  When Anakin learns who Palpatine is, yeah he tells Windu, but then he kills Windu to save Palpatine because he could not let go of his lust for power and his fear of Padme's death.Padme's character captures how a person will try to save the ones they love from self destruction.  She could see the stress her husband was under and knew that Anakin wanted more power and control over things, but probably did not want to admit that the man she loved was disappearing.  You see her self-denial in the scene between her and Obi'wan when she learns about Anakin's role in the destruction of the Jedi Temple.  This is why she dies.  She dies of a broken heart.  Natalie Portman does a good job in portraying Padme.  Padme is a very strong, forceful leader who believes strongly in democracy and in the preservation of the republic.  And she truly cares about the people she leads and represents.  I have heard complaints about her character in Ep. III and how it is a bit more docile and not needed, but her character is needed.  She's pregnant and of course is not going to go after some bad guys with a blaster.  Instead, she has a different battlefield which is within the senate.  She sees the republic failing and tries to tell Anakin about it and how there is something wrong with Palpatine still being in power and he gets angry with her.  Padme does one of the hardest things a person can do.  She sees a person she loves on the road to self-destruction and tries to pull him away from it all because what she really wants is to live her life with Anakin and raise a family.  Anakin rewards her by putting her in a choke hold.If you want to know what Anakin does in the next 20 years as Darth Vader up until we meet Luke, this tells you right here.  Anakin has completely lost himself.  Tee innocent boy that we met in Ep. I is gone competely, since as Yoda put it, Anakin is gone ""consumed by Vader,"" by his own anger and hatred and envy, traits we all have.  Anakin's path to the dark side symbolizes what happens to those who give in to their anger, their jealousies, and their want for power.I like Obi'wan's portrayal in Ep.III.  You can see how much Obi'wan has grown to love Anakin as a brother and perhaps a son.  At the end of the movie he knows what will happen if he pursues Anakin to the Mustafar system and begs Yoda not to send him.  However, Obi'wan is very diligent in his duty of doing what is right and just.  He finds Anakin and fights him after seeing what Anakin has become, but he doesn't kill him.  The scene where Obi'wan tells Anakin how much he cared about him while Anakin is missing three of his limbs, really puts into perspective how much Obi'wan loved Anakin and that love carries over to Luke in Ep. IV,V,VI.  Obi'wan could not bring himself to kill Anakin becasue he remembers who Anakin once was.Episode III finishes the 2nd triology nicely.  It really shows how Anakin becomes Darth Vader and how Obi'wan and Yoda get to be where they are when we meet them in the first triology.  Ep. III is the final link in the chain that tells the story of a galaxy far, far away, a long time ago.  The two triologies are two different stories that tell one story.  I think the reason why some people did not like it, was because it was not what they thought it should be.  When Ep. I came out we all knew what the storyline was going to be and so everyone pictured what they thought the 2nd triology should look like: what it should have and what should happen.  George Lucas wrote the story the way he thought it should be and becasue it did not fill all of our expectations people had and wasn't produced the way we would do it, it got some bad reviews.  I think the acting was done well in the protrayal of the characters.  The dialogue may have been a bit dumb in some places, but what movie doesn't have instances of bad dialogue?  The story of the 2nd Star Wars triology is a good story line and it explains how things are the way they are in the first triology and Episode III finishes things up nicely.  Yes, it has a lot of action, but people expect that in a Star Wars film.  It is a bit dark and depressing, but there is hope there too becasue we know what comes next.  For those of you who did not like the 2nd triology I suggest that you watch it again and don't think about what's wrong with it, but just watch as the story unfolds about a man who gave in to his anger and his weaknesses and the cold counsel of a nefarious senator."	5.0	A Good End to the Second Triology	2007-03-07	7	5	2

This is the final installment for Lucas' Star Wars franchise.The premise of the movie is that the Republic goes under extreme changes, and you learn what leads to the Darth Vader's creation and reasons for this dramatic change.You also learn what becomes of the Republic and who the new ruler is.Out of the 3 prequels, this one is probably the most dramatic and intensifying one you'll see.Full of dramatic twists & turns, you'll be amazed at the special effects; although, there seem to be less special effects as there were in the previous ones.Episode 3 seems to be more focused on drama and action than it does on actual special effects.You'll also be introducted to Chewbacca and the wookies and see Yoda wielding a light-saber.I cannot readily recall if you've seen Yoda wielding a light saber in the previous 2 episodes, or not, but you do in this one!Excellent movie for those interested in learning Darth Vader's creation.I give this movie 4 stars because the ending was lackluster and lack of special effects and vivid colors. However, the acting and the story-line itself were superb.*Highly recommended for those 13 and above due to violence.	4.0	Exhilirating,exciting, and most of all..DRAMATIC!	2006-01-30	5	1	4

Gee im going to go staughter millions and millions of innocent beings because I had a gay dream that my wife died during child birth. NONSENCE.Could'nt you give us something better than that.  And hey lets turn in this sith lord to Mace Windu then change my mind and go kill him. Duh! (which by the way Sam Jacksons acting in this movie was so bad I thought it was comedy releaf at first.) The only person in this movie that can truly act is Ewan McGregor. Well I could go on for ever at how bad this stupid movie was but I cant waste anymore time with it.

Everyone complained about Episode 1, namely because of Jar Jar. Episode 2 was a little more action packed, and we got to see how Anakin began his gradual slope towards evil and how he fell in love with Amidala.Then comes Revenge of the Sith.From the very beginning, you get all the action in Star Wars you want, and then some. I noticed that only three lines seemed cheesy and sort of out of place.Things got real dark when Order 66 was issued. Some people complained that the Jedi were killed off too easily. (Read the book to open your eyes, foolish ones.)The movie boasts some of the best lightsaber fights ever seen in Star Wars. Grevious was sort of a disappointment, seeing as how the general audience kept asking (Duuuh, why is he coughing?)Anyway, the fight between Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi was the hallmark of any lightsaber fight, ever.Then came the Immolation Scene, which was one of the most painful scenes in the entire movie.Then came the infamous ""Noooooo!"" line that everyone thought was awful.

Smith	Despite the misplaced critics of this new Star Wars episode, I thought it did its job rather well, though I'm no SW fanatic. I grew weary of the endless light saber duels which never seem to go anywhere. And the lengthy battles are a lot of noise and light with little sense. However, where this one satisfies is in its explanations and depictions of where Darth Vader came from, as well as his mentor. You also see the rather goofy young Obi Wan Kenobi at his peak. The massacre of the Jedi is an obvious ripoff of The Godfather where the Don's Mafia rivals are executed, as is quite a bit of this film, I thought. I liked the special effects here, and cannot quite share the dislike of others for this latest incarnation. Well done.	4.0	Satisfying plot connector	2009-03-09	1	1	0
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AR8Y6VPVUHCSB	"Brad Torgersen ""Full-time nerd, part-time sol..."	Whatever became of Lucas's writing and directing skill?  It's nowhere in evidence on this third, wholly underwhelming prequel to the blockbuster ORIGINAL Star Wars Saga.  The acting talent is (mostly) there, but it's horribly wasted on a dull script.  Plot?  Who needs plot when we can suffocate the moviegoer with super-fantastic 21st century CGI cinematography!  Action?  Oh yeah, lots of that.  Way too much in fact.  A great deal of it pointless and/or gratuitous.Like just about everyone else who grew up loving the original Saga, I greatly anticipated Lucas's return to this rich mental playground he has created.  Alas, through three ham-handed prequels, he's managed to utterly extinguish my enthusiasm for the Star Wars universe, insomuch that I am probably going to just disavow the prequels altogether.And this particular prequel is the worst of the bunch!  And it's all on Lucas.  The genesis of Darth Vader, the emergence of the Empire, the revealing of the Emperor, all of these things provided fertile soil for what should have been a gripping trip to the Dark Side; alas, like the previous two films, Lucas turned Episode 3 into popcorn kiddie fluff that bores when it does not nauseate.  The villains do not scare, the heroes do not thrill, and there is little of the mystery, suspense, or wonder that comes with any of the originals.And the romance between Portman and Christensen is totally lifeless; a poor, poor follow-up to the sparks that flew between Ford and Fisher.  Vader's relationship with his lover/wife should have given us even more high drama than even his relationship with his lost son.  But Lucas bungles this, as he bungles most else in the prequels, and I can only shake my head and wish that I could get back the hours lost watching this movie.Do yourself a favor.  Don't waste your time or money.  Invest in the original Saga and pretend the prequels ever happened.	1.0	Lucas should have stuck to producing!

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3FL2SSZ980NOY	"Braithwaite ""W."""	"The only thing good about this movie are the light sabre battles; and even they have glaring flaws.Lucas has shown his utter contempt for his audience with these prequels.  I remember well when he saw the line of fans who had waited years for a ""star wars film"" since ""Return of the Jedi"" and Lucas sarcastically quipped that the fans needed a life.  A strange remark coming from a man making very bad prequels but who had many people willing to put money into his pompous pockets just to relive a moment of Star Wars history,--that moment they felt when they watched the first three movies--especially ""A New Hope"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"".  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" being arguably the best movie in the entire series.  The magic began to fade during ""Return of the Jedi"" when Lucas had the little Ewoks basically being the cause for the destruction of the Empire.  Luke, Vader, and the encounter with The Emperor being the best part of the whole movie.  He should have stopped while he still had some of the old magic left.  Oh yea; and we come to find out that by the third movie ""Return"" this is somehow some morality play about Vietnam and how a less advanced society could overthrow the shackles of a powerful empire.  I guess the Ewoks were the Viet-Cong (the good guys to Lucas); and the United States was the Empire (the bad guys).  This is a constant obsession with George Lucas.  Right through the prequels into this movie: ""Revenge of the Sith"", Lucas still made comments about this being a metaphor for the Vietnam War.  He is inane to say the least.  I payed attention to his ramblings over the years, and he has basically lost it.  His contempt for the people who paid to see his movies is a stated fact.  The movies themselves, as embodied in the prequels, is just one more point which proves the case.The more success Lucas gained with the original three, the less controul the studios and others had on the content of the movies.  The constant meddling by others kept Lucas from completely getting his way during the first three movies, thus their appeal to the audience.Thus when we come to the ""Revenge of the Sith"" Lucas is entirely in the drivers seat.  That is why this movie is ultimately a failure.  Plot contrivances and holes an eighteen wheeler could drive through galore.  Bad dialogue; bad acting . . . without Ian McDiarmid and Frank Oz, with a brief appearance by Christopher Lee, this movie would be unwatchable.  The very first light sabre dual, it is clear Count Dooku (Lee) is more powerful than either of the Jedi.  Obi-Wan seems continually the weaker of the two; and I still cannot figure out how Anakin beat Dooku when Dooku was tossing both of them around like rag dolls without their stuffing.The CGI effects were good; but one gaf after another make watching the entire movie untenable for me.  I generally just cut to the chase and watch Yoda and The Emperor duel to the death,--well almost the death.  How Yoda had this much evil sitting right under his nose, I'll never know.  You could smell the Emperor's power in the outer rim.  Yoda must have been dozing instead of meditating during the ""quiet time"" of Jedi reflection! ""My my Palpatine, what a big nose you have!""Even that battle was less than satisfactory.  Yoda was clearly the more powerful, but not by much.  Palpatine had lived for 70 years; Yoda for 800!  If Palpatine had had ten more years, he could have put Yoda in a blender and made a very green protein shake!  :)The constant statement is the Good Side is more powerful; but the Dark Side keeps kicking Jedi posterior all over the place!  It just doesn't work.  The messages are contradictory in the extreme.  Actions speak; the rhetoric of the Jedi proves them liars--or delusional!And could someone please tell me how Obi-Wan and Anakin could fight on a Lava Planet without force fields and both of them not be reduced to ash!?  If someone stood at the mouth of an active volcano while it spewed hot lava drops and generally emitting enough heat to melt even Superman, I think that person would basically go poof!  No more person.  All that heat traveling upwards tends to crumble human flesh.Oh; and one last word: Nice going Obi-Wan.  Instead of finishing Vader/Anakin off, just let him lay there and broil in his own juices.  We have to keep the Jedi Code in force.  Never kill an unarmed opponent.  Just let this murdering thug of children lie there and light up the night sky as a human torch.  Such love for your brother to let him die by inches.  No sense wasting your light sabre batteries.  Later Anakin; I have to leave, I just cant watch you burn slowly on convection setting. :)And so, and thus a legend is born!  A very lame, pathetic legend.  Lucas had almost twenty years to think up a good set of prequels.  It shows just how untalented a story teller he really is.But it's alright: Spielberg shed a tear when he saw his horrid movie.That makes it all worth while in the end,--NOT!Braithwaite*I shed a tear too.  I was laughing so hard and thinking: ""Why didn't this schmuck, Lucas, leave well enough alone.  In a word: Ego!***1 Star for Lucas; 3 for McDiarmid, Oz and Lee!**"	2.0	The Merciful End of a Saga that I never wanted to see!  Howard the Duck: where are you when we need you?!	2008-06-30	4	2	2

Harlow	"I caught the show at a sold-out theater last night and (like the other prequels) was not very impressed.This film is long. In fact, too long. They could have shaved about 45 minutes off the run time and ended up with a more exciting film. The lulls in between scenes was nearly torture.SPOILERS:The opening fight scene was just how I thought it would be. Overkill and uneventful. It lasted about what? 20 minutes? Ugh.General Grievous - OK, he coughs...we get the idea already!!!The ""love"" story - so funny I laughed at a few points. Lucas is NOT a good (or even adequate) screenwriter.Yoda - UGH! Enough already!Samuel L. Jackson - he should be VERY embarassed.The Wookies - so completely unecessary. When they popped up to battle I thought ""Oh no...another 25 minutes of watching them just shout & scream"" but luckily the fight scene was practically abandoned.Darth Siddeous - STOLE THE SHOW!!! You can tell the actor portraying him is classically trained since he probably read the script and thought ""well this is putrid, so I'll just make it over-the-top and collect my check."" Loved when he beat up on Yoda!Anakin/Vader - Such a wooden actor, but I guess in a film like this he cannot be blamed. Lucas probably thought it was great that he was so detached and unemotional, save for screaming.Padme - A Star Wars movie and she spends the whole time hanging out in an apartment?R2D2 - overkill on that annoying scream of hisObi One - Ewan will escape these movies unscathed.

The acting is all improved, Ewan McGregor and Iam McDiarmand have the best performance by far.  Hayden Christensen did a little better, if you seen my review for Ep. 2 you know I didn't think he was bad and really good in some parts. The action is probably the best in the series, this movie is filled with lightsaber duels and they are all great especially the one on Mustafar.

"I admit it, I was one of the first to call George Lucas overrated in regards to the original trilogy and the two previous episodes.  And frankly, even though I like although unevenly every movie in the Star Wars saga, none of them really made me fall passionately in love with Star Wars like episode III.  For some reason, Revenge of the Sith is a perfect movie to me.  I know many people might argue that there isn't such a thing as a ""perfect"" film.  They're right in their own perceptions of it and I respect that.  But personally, since I am someone who was never transfixed as a child by the original trilogy, I might have quite a different take on it.Discussions about the story would be rather pointless since everyone is familiar with most of it.  But Revenge is to me the culmination of everything I wanted out of Star Wars.  The images are breathtakingly luscious and so busy you'll need multiple viewings to take all of its splendor in.  The special effects are once again flawless in their execution and all the work involved in every single frame of film is clearly visible in every shot. But mostly, George finally gave me a reason to respect his wisdom in doing exactly what he wants without any apologies in terms of story. And in my book, he totally succeeds on that front.Revenge is to me the kind of film I can watch dozens of times and this quality is very high in my book.  This was also surprisingly one of his best reviewed movie and deservedly so.  Don't let your expectations of what Star Wars should be in your own mind ruin this delightful and grandiose cinematographic experience.  George had to satisfy expectations of so many legions of fans from different demographics that it's a miracle he was able to hold true to his vision from the very beginning and the huge success of Revenge at the box-office is a testament to his powerful cinematic abilities.  I just LOVE that film.  George, add me to your millions of fans who have been completely satisfied."	5.0	The culmination of every expectations...	2005-11-06	8	2	6
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1TR0WPC93BEC8	"Brendan L. Agnew ""rothwyn"""	"Only 3 Stars? ""Nooooooooooooooooo!!!""Well. . . it's the best Star Wars film since Jedi.Unfortunately, there's so much that's uneven about Episode III: Revenge of the Sith that this is really some of the best praise that can be heaped upon it. The film wraps up what whas begun in 1999's ham-fisted and juvenial The Phantom Menace and continued in 2002's cheese-ridden and painfully soap-operatic Attack of the Clones. And while Ep. III retains the stilted dialogue and (frequently) awkward performances of its predecessors, it still manages to feel like Star Wars. . . for a lot of the time.To get the unpleasant out of the way, it would be best to discuss Ep. III's weaknesses before its strengths. For a myriad of reasons (mostly because the entire Prequel Trilogy was mishandled from the beginning), Ep. III doesn't make a lot of sense unless you've seen not only Ep. I and II, but also the entire Clone Wars cartoon micro-series that aired on Cartoon Network. The opening scene of the deafening space battle above the capital world of Coruscaunt is easy enough to follow, but the villains who show up shortly after Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi land on an anemy ship to rescue the captured Chancellor Palpatine are sadly underused (or, like Vader himself, get turned lame somehow). Christopher Lee gets even less screen time in this film than he did in the last, and the mysterious asthma-stricken cyborg/Jedi killer extraordinaire General Grievous doesn't fair much better. Apparently, there just there to be cannon fodder.This general breezing through of important information is a lingering problem in Revenge of the Sith. Padme (who is not any more bearable this time around, sorry), goes from announcing a pregnancy to being full-on swollen in abour a half-an-hour of the movie with almost no real demonstration of a time lapse. Characters are either given too much time on screen (Anakin and Padme still have zero chemistry) or not enough (like, say, all the Jedi that are going to be horribly murdered in the movie). Ever other minute it seems like there's a wipe or disolve to take the viewer somewhere else as the movie desperately tries to keep up with the convoluted plots, counter-plots, schemes, and machinations of the future Emperor Palpatine. Most of the time, it works fairly well, but sometimes it just seems like the film is just throwing action around for the sake of having action.On the plus side, the action is pretty damn good. Even in the opening scene of the film, where it's obvious that spectacle is the only important thing about the battle, the action manages to hold your attention and even impress. As do a couple of the performances. It's just a shame that Hayden Christensen's isn't one of these.And this is the real problem. Anakin's fall to the dark side, the most important part of the entire prequel trilogy, just doesn't pay off. While there are moments when you can see some geniune feeling and darkness, there's still just too much of the transformation that comes off as Anakin being a sulky jackass. Some great fabulous acting from Ian McDiarmid helps in a few key scenes (though he degrades to a horrible B-movie rendition of his brilliant Emperor character from Return of the Jedi later in the fil). However, Anakin's seduction by the dark side never seems natural, and far too forced in many scenes, less of an actual fall and more of a ""quick, we only have one movie to really turn him into Vader"" series of events.However, there are still some great moments here and there, and the overall quality is definitely above its prequel bretheren. The aforementioned Diarmid does a wonderfully twisted fatherly figure, as well as reminding us how nasty the Emperor in Jedi could be just by smiling congenially at you. Ewan McGreggor does an admirable job of carrying a lot of the film, and Frank Oz turns in a touching performance as Yoda, even without a muppet to help him. And finesse or no finesse, when the fit hits the shan, it can be pretty wrenching. Even if you don't know anything about the Jedi that are getting mowed down by stormtroopers, they're still Jedi, and it sucks to see them bite the dust like that. And as you may know, there are lightsaber fights. And yes, they rock. The final duel between Anakin and Obi Wan doesn't quite reach the level acrobatic perfection achieved by Duel of the Fates (too many close-in shots), but it's much easier to sit through the film to get to it.Overall, Ep. III, uneven as it is in plaves, is undeniably the best of the recent trilogy (if only by default), and is worth sitting through it's two-and-a-half hours, and you'll see some impressive sights along the way. And while there are a few tugs at the emotional heartstrings, don't expect them to be nearly as effective as this trilogy's predecessor was a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away."	3.0	The Force is (sort of) strong with this one. . .	2005-11-07	13	11	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A5BKZ17F36KE8	"Brett A. Tolino ""Brett Tolino"""	Think of Star Wars as a book told in film. Each episode represents a different chapter. Yes, as in a book, each chapter CAN be read separately but if you read them individually or out of order, you don't get the whole story. Additionally, as in a book, some chapters are more exciting than others but that doesn't make any chapter less important when trying to understand the whole story. And the tale Star Wars is trying to tell is one of the greatest stories of our generation, possibly ever told.In the most simplest terms, Star Wars tells the story of how a good person can go bad through choices made throughout a life and these are the very same, basic choices which each person faces every day of their life. Like most people's lives, Star Wars begins the tale of this individual as a child, a good person, making it easier to discern how this personality assists in the decision making process utilized when facing their choices.The themes covered in Star Wars are basic though told in a simplistic, entertaining fashion that communicates to people of all races, creeds and ages. There's something in it for everyone: adventure, romance, humor, heartache, family, fun and spirituality. It also tells the tale of how a democratic government, one developed around the choices of the people can fall, transforming into a destructive dictatiorship, leaving the people with, no choice.An exciting film with tons of heart, Revenge Of The Sith is the centerpiece of the saga, the turning point, the place where everything from Acts One and Two meet and collide, setting the stage for the next three Acts... and if you watch one and two, one would never have imagined it would roll down the path seen in Acts Four, Five and Six. Through the pure genius of George Lucas' storytelling, Revenge of The Sith, perhaps one of the most underrated films of our time, taking cues from Shakespeare, Dante, Milton and Faust, shows in essence how the road to hell is paved with good intentions.Excellent. Pure, genius. On a scale of one to five, it gets 105.	5.0	The Greatest Story Ever Told.	2005-08-02	13	10	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A141HP4LYPWMSR	Brian E. Erland	With the release of the '05 film `Star Wars - Revenge of the Sith' it appears George Lucas got the message and delivers a dark, brooding tale that the older and largest portion of this fan base can finally enjoy. It's a wonderful journey that takes the viewer down the dangerous path awaiting those that allow themselves to be consumed by fear, desire, selfishness and obsession.While this film suffers from the same lame dialogue we've come to expect, the awe inspiring special effects and finally complimented by a storyline worthy of our time and attention. Gone are the cutsie little creatures that dominated `The Phantom Menace' and `Attack of the Clones' giving way to a marvelous battle to the death between the selfless Jedi and the self obsessed Sith.`Revenge of the Sith' is definitely the best of the three most recent episodes in the `Star Wars' saga, surpassed only by the original `Star Wars' and `The Empire Strikes Back'. A nice way to wrap things up, thanks Mr. Lucas!	4.0	"""I'm Not The Jedi I Should Be"" ~ Embracing The Darkside Of The Force"	2008-05-30	0	0	0

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3H2CKTFZ3B3GD	Brian Hawkinson	"... because this is such a horrible movie.  The first two were okay, nothing special, and perhaps lived on the hype of being the long awaited Star Wars movies that Lucas was writing.  But this the third installment is absolutely dreadful.  The writing is bad, the acting is bad, even the special effects make it look more cartoonish than it does a high budget sci-fi film.The writing.  Could we be any worse?  The storyline is forced, which is understandable since Lucas had to force this film to connect with the original series.  But what is with the cheesy, one liners from the humans and the droids?  When an elevator shoots up the shaft two robots say, ""uh oh"", and this happens continuously.  The robot one liners happen so often you become distracted.The acting, especially when coupled with the writing, makes this movie unbearable.  Here is a quick interaction between Padme and Anakin:""You are so beautiful""""It is because I am in love with you.""""No, it is because I am in love with you.""Could this be any worse?  Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen already couldn't act, but with this script they looked awful.  Or how about the Choobakka characters swinging from flying ships doing the tarzan yell?  Why bring in stuff like that and detract from the uniqueness of this potential story?  But it is done time and again.This A rated film and budget is nothing more than a B rate film in disquise with poor performances from all of the actors (even Samuel Jackson was horrible and unbelievable) attempting to make money off of the Star Wars legacy of the 70s and 80s.  If there is any saving grace with this film it is that it is finally over, and that at least there was some explanation for how Vader became who he was, how he became the deformed Darth Vader of the much loved and respected original Star Wars films."	1.0	A sith lord must have infiltrated LucasFilms...	2005-11-12	27	18	9
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A391YPR0NFTCLK	Brian	"I think that this movie will capture the same magic as ""The Empire Strikes Back"". Becuase if you think about it ""The Phantom Menace"" was goofy and to kiddish just like ""Return of the Jedi"" it was more for the younger audiance. ""A New Hope"" was more like ""Attack of the Clones"" because it was serious but also alot of fun. It blended adult themes and made them fun for the kids and adults. Now I think that ""Revenge of the Sith"" will be more like ""The Empire Stikes Back"". Why because ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was the darkest and most serious out of the Star Wars Episodes. ""Revenge of the Sith"" scemes to be very dark due to the story line and for the fact that every charecter we know from ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones"" is going to die and Anakin will become Evil. I think that most adults will love this movie because ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the best and I think that ""Revenge of the Sith"" is going to please fans and bridge the gap between the story lines. I think that you will be plesantly supriesed, well probably depressed after the movie is over because everyone dies, but I still think that this movie is going to be great. To tell you the truth I think that ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones"" are great movies and I think George Lucus will have to hack ""Revenge of the Sith"" appart for me not to love it. ""The Phantom Menace"", ""Attack of the Clones"", ""Revenge of the Sith"", ""A New Hope"", ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"" are all classic films that I know I will show my kids and I will cherish these movies forever.Other Classic Sci-Fi Series I Love:""The Terminator""""Terminator 2: Judgment Day""""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines""""The Matrix""""The Matrix Reloaded""""The Matrix Revolutions""""Back to the Future""""Back to the Future: Part II""""Back to the Future: Part III"""	5.0	My Predictions	2004-09-11	11	5	6

The plot is lame, Lucas had THREE movies to detail the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker and Anakin turns to the Dark Side like in 15 seconds with the all time lamest motivation. ""I had a dream that my wife was going to die, if I learn the ways of the Dark Side I can learn how to bring her back to life!!"" Sounds like a plan moron, too bad you couldn't have a dream about the thousands of soldiers that were going to betray the Jedi, pretty nifty bit of deception that.The list goes on and on but now I'm wondering why I took the time to review this waste of film so I'll stop here.Lucas is insane.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3TTK5BJ4JXZFJ	"Brian Libby ""Gadfly"""	"This will be short, partly because, unlike I & II, III has at least a consistent story line. Mr. Lucas had to accomplish a certain number of things to link with the next film, so he could spend less time on tangents. One could point out that, as the possibility of ever-more-spectacular SFX becomes reality, the film depends too much on mere visual glitz--the opening battle being a good example, in that it is not clear to the viewer exactly why the battle is being fought (or who wins it, for that matter), but we must accept that Mr. Lucas and his coterie of animators and computer mavens have pretty well been seduced by the dark side of the... I mean, have reached the point where in their minds flashy things on the screen are a desirable substitute for story and acting.My chief objections are about the end of the film.First, we learn that Anakin joins the Sith primarily because he hopes to save Padme from death. But the Emperor tells him that this can only be done with additional research. (""If we work together, I know we can discover the secret."") But since Padme is supposed to die in childbirth, and is nine months pregnant, it does not seem that there is much time to get this research done, does it? Anakin might at that point have realized that Palpatine can actually do nothing to save his wife, and has been lying to him.Padme's death: entirely unconvincing. We are told she is in good health. We see that she is conscious and rational: she names her children. Then she dies. Of a broken heart? But would not the birth of two healthy children, and her maternal desire to raise them, keep her alive? Would she die and abandon them? Now, Padme's demise was actually caused by the plot of the film: since Luke S. has no living mother in Parts IV-VI, Mr. Lucas just had to get her out of the way. Why he chose to do so in so unconvincing a manner I don't know. But, then, screenwriting has not been his strong point in the last few years.""Hidden, safe, the children must be kept"" says guess who. Yes, fine. How shall we do this? Well, let's give the girl to Bail Organa, one of the most conspicuous figures in the Senate, one of three people nominated for Chancellor when Valorum was forced out. (Would not the sudden appearance of a baby girl in his family attract at least a tiny bit of attention? Adopted? Where is the paperwork?) As for the boy--""to Tatooine and his family send him"". (Ha! That will fool the Emperor--he'd never think of looking there.)George Lucas should have hired a writer--several writers. He simply no longer has the imagination and skill to write good scripts. He is mainly interested in spectacle and SFX (and marketing. Several times I almost wrote Lucre instead of Lucas.). He has been seduced by... oops, there I go again.(For a very entertaining, and somewhat harsher, review of this movie, look up the Nov. 21, 2005, 1-star review ""Yikes"" by mptesteroni. It's a most enjoyable piece that rises to real heights of intelligent irate indignation. You may enjoy it more than the film.)"	2.0	STAR WARS III - Revenge of the Plot	2007-07-12	18	14	4
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3TUE4JZMN4HYO	"Brian Martin ""foliowyrm"""	I was a huge fan of the original trilogy growing up in the 70's  and 80's but my affection for the Star Wars universe is somewhat dimmed with the addition of episodes one, two and three.  The special effects and and CGI in Episode 3 are top notch and the opening sequence is perhaps the greatest visual space battle put on celuloid to date.  I will gladly admitt this film is beautiful to look at.  The problem is just about everything else.First off there is no tension in the story as anyone who saw the original trilogy will know the fate of each and every character in this movie.  Personally I think Lucas erred in recycling characters from the first trilogy.  Aside from Kenobi, Anakyn and Yoda there was no need for the rest.  Too much old and not enough new.Second, Lucas skills' as a director are limited and he doesn't bring out the best in his actor's to say the least.  McGregor is a great actor but not evan he can save this film.  Natalie Portman especially suffers in this movie and it is a shame because she is a great actress not just the eye candy she is in this film.  Speaking of Portman I'm not so sure she is proud of this film, when it came out I did not see her promote it at all.Finally the story was just not that compelling to me.  I always had envisioned Darth Vader as the ultimate villian and tragic character who's fall from grace would be epic.  Lucas' vision is a whinny teenager who can't get his way.  Oh well, it is over and done with I guess.  The movie is watchable eye candy if nothing else.	3.0	I guess you can't go home again.	2007-11-25	4	4	0

From the moment that I saw the trailers for the film, I knew that it was going to be an awesome movie but I was totally unprepared for exactly how awesome, both visually and emotionally, the film would be. ""Revenge of the Sith"" is largely a satisfying payoff for everything that has been building up from ""The Phantom Menace"" and, of course, sets the stage for the events of original Star Wars trilogy 19 years later. The music, once again composed by John Williams, is excellent as always and includes the awesome new theme, ""Battle of the Heroes,"" composed for the inevitable and historic lightsaber duel between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. Although others might disagree, I felt that the acting by the principals in ""Revenge of the Sith"" was much improved from the previous two prequels, or at least the ""bad"" acting didn't seem quite as noticeable given the sheer intensity of the multiple fast-paced action sequences in the movie. Natalie Portman's role, was MUCH diminished in this movie, apparently because the directors wanted it to focus mainly on Anakin and his final seemingly irrevocable turn to the dark side (there were some pretty good cut scenes viewable on the DVD regarding Portman's involvement in the beginning phases of the future Rebel Alliance however). I can't say enough good things about Ian McDiarmid and his portrayal of the evil Darth Sidious/Chancellor (turned Emperor) Palpatine in this movie. He was simply OUTSTANDING in his role and Ewan McGregor, as he did in the previous movie, presented as a very believable younger Obi-Wan Kenobi. The movie is certainly one of the darkest and most intense Star Wars movies to date with the possible exception of ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Although there are some small victories for the ""good guys"" (Obi-Wan and Yoda survive and save Luke & Leia after they are born), it is the ""bad guys"" who end up carrying the day in this movie: All of the members of the Jedi High Council except for Yoda and Obi-Wan are systematically killed and the Jedi temple is stormed and its inhabitants, including the ""younglings"", are mercilessly slaughtered with Anakin leading the attack himself. Finally, the Clone Wars comes to an abrupt end with the deaths of Count Dooku, General Grievous, and the Separatist Leadership Council, only to have the Senate vote Palpatine's Empire into existence. Despite the desperate attempts of Yoda and Obi-wan to take down Darth Sidious/Palpatine and Anakin/Darth Vader, they ultimately succeed only in crippling Anakin/Darth Vader and (barely) escaping with their lives. The movie ends on bittersweet note with Padme giving birth to Luke and Leia only to pass away immediately afterward and Obi-Wan and Yoda make the decision to hide the children and retire into exile to wait for another opportunity to take on the Empire. I don't have any MAJOR criticisms of the film, just a few ""nitpicks,"" that, ultimately, really don't impact the viewing pleasure of the movie for me too much, if at all:1.) I wish that the writers could have given a more plausible reason for Padme's death. Her supposedly dying of a ""broken heart"" just seemed silly. I like to think that the she just succumbed to the strain of everything that had happened to her plus Anakin choking her out of rage when he thought she had betrayed him. 2.) I wish that the writers would've left some scenes in the film that hint at the coming rebellion against the Empire like the deleted scene where Padme and the Senators attempt to persuade Palpatine to sign a petition agreeing to give up his emergency powers at the end of the Clone Wars. 3.) I wish that we could've actually SEEN or HEARD Qui-Gon talking to Yoda about his newfound abilities to return as a ""ghost"" using the force. I don't know if Liam Neeson was unavailable or unwilling to do such a scene but it would've made the scene at the end more interesting/compelling rather than having Yoda simply tell Obi-Wan about it but that's just my ""point of view"".Nitpicks aside, ""Revenge of the Sith"" was, overall, an EXCELLENT film. If you are a Star Wars fan or even a casual moviegoer, I do not expect that you would regret seeing this film. Also, I would recommend reading the excellent novelization of the film by Matthew Stover and the immediate post-""Revenge of the Sith"" follow-up story, ""Dark Lord:The Rise of Darth Vader"" for some additional character development in regards to Anakin/Vader, the rise of the Empire, and the fate of the remaining Jedi.

The graphics are incredible, the story line is great, and all the losse ends are tied up. I think that in this episode George Lucas perfectly connected all of the other star wars films. He made the movie with breathtaking battle scenes as well as great characterization. Anakin was his true stroke of brilliance; in Revenge of the Sith Lucas does a perfect depiction of Anakin's inner conflict and makes it evident how he was swayed down the path of the dark side. From what I saw in the 2nd episode, I expected Anakin to already be at conflict with Obiwan and to be farther down the rode of Sideous' apprentice, but the movie starts him off as a true friend to Obiwan and a jedi with good virtues and over time he falls into darkness. An amazing movie except for two things I found. The 1st is some short instances of pathetic dialog between Anakin and Padme that could have been done better. And there is one very minor story error at the end of the movie(I won't spoil the ending so I'll let you find it), but other than those to small things this movie was dynamite!	5.0	A Perfect Movie	2005-09-11	3	2	1

Compared with those movies, this movie is not so great. Compared to the other two prequels, it is the best of the three. It turns away from the tortuous details of Senate politics that infected its predecessor, ""Attack of the Clones"", and tries to get back to the action, relationships, and moral dilemmas that are at the heart of the ""Star Wars"" series. However, this film has many flaws that could have been eradicated with more of a conscientious effort by creator, director, and writer George Lucas.It basically forms a straight line, plot-wise, from Episode Two to Episode Four with no surprises and little character development, and depends upon what you already know about the entire Star Wars mythology to invest you in this movie and its characters rather than the action and dialogue of this one particular film. Also, there is little use made of either Natalie Portman's  Padme Amidala - who actually has very little screen time - or the excellent Samuel L. Jackson, who is completely wasted given the small part that his character has in this film. Why employ such a great actor if you are going to give him lines that any extra could deliver?Additionally, for someone who has spent the last ten or fifteen years learning and living the ways of the Jedi, Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker seems to have very little inner turmoil making a sudden and complete transformation from protector of innocents to the apprentice of evil. He irrationally uses his desire to ensure his wife's safety - when there is no perceivable threat to her health other than his own premonitions - as an excuse to savage anyone who might get in his way and even some who couldn't if they wanted to, such as the ""younglings"" that he slaughters in the Jedi temple at Palpatine's behest. Thus the so-called transformation into Darth Vader is more like the flipping of a switch - more binary than analog.The best performance is that of Ian McDiarmid as Chancellor Palpatine/""The Emporer"". He has a serpentine smoothness about him as he subtly plants doubts in Skywalker's mind about who is really on the side of evil while deftly handling all of the warring factions of the Republic so that people will actually be grateful when he takes complete power.In summary, if you have seen all of the other Star Wars films you will probably enjoy this one because it fills in all of the gaps and answers all of the remaining questions. However, with some more effort in the direction and writing, those questions could have been answered with much better dialogue and characters that were more three-dimensional."	3.0	Best of the Star Wars trilogy of prequels	2006-06-18	4	3	1

I love it more than any other movie, and i love the other episodes pretty damn much!I always knew, that George never dissapoints, and i just relaxed and waited until he would give us ep.3!! I loved ep.1, and saw it 15 times at the theatres alone, and many, many times at home as well. I unfortunately didn't see ep.2 many times at the theatre, but i couldn't stand-up after the first showing, because it simply blew me away and took my breath away!All of you, who don't get it: Watch something else, and be happy with your ""meaningful"" Matrix, LOTR ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,haha,hahahI really pity you people, because i have never experienced so much stupidity, as some of you people, are going on with trying to destroy the enjoyment of the best movies ever made, which will never be possible!!!It's zen buddhism, and so deep, that you fools have no idea what you're even talking about!!!It's about the complexity of life itself! The line between good and evil is not as clear as one might think, and there is always a reason, why somebody has become evil. In Episode IV. we saw, good versus evil, but then we figured out that the bad guy is the good guy's Father!!! Then the good guy, begun to believe, that there's still some good in the bad guy and in the end, was even willing to sacrifice himself, to show his father, that he completely trusts in him, and that at his heart, he is still a jedi and can undo his mistake! His father then begun to realize his failure and returned to the good side!!!One other thing: Leia said that she just remembers images of her mother, and that she was very beautiful, but sad: Who said that this had to be Padme!!!!!????? Did you ever think????? DO you ever think????It, of course, was her foster mother (Bail's wife), who apparantly died relatively soon afterwards, because of some sort of sickness (people can actually die of sickness!!) or so!!Nobody ever mentioned Padme's name, when talking about Leia's mom!!!!!! So, where is the mistake??????Leia never knew her real mother (Padme) or father (Anakin-Vader), so she thought Bail and his wife, were her real parents!!! It's as simple as that!!Thank you very much!Star Wars is a symphony, an opera, a masterpiece in every way!Just the scene where Padme dies, and at the same time Vader comes to Life, as well as Padme gives birth to Luke and Leia!!!It's magical, as are so many other moments in all of the series!I'd really love to see ep. IV.,V., and VI redone, at the very least, many of the visual effects and the like!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Yoda ist perfect in ep.III, the detail is just breath-taking and this version of him should be in all of the episodes he his in :ep.I, ep.II, ep.V and ep. VI, as well as Jabba the hutt, should be replaced with the episode I version of him!!!!!The Rankor monster and all the others!!!!!!!Ep.III is perfect (everything is relative!)The should apply the flesh and bone tecnology, they used in ep.2 and ep.3 on ep.1 and the other episodes as well (Mos eisly in ep.IV)! It would add a lot of realism to the whole thing!!! But those are only tecnical problems!But it really would be great and help the overall experience!They are truly inspiring movies, and if we unlearn what we've learned, then we can learn a lot from them! May the force be with you!!!!Anakin is attached to Padme (ego, greed, lust, creates jealousy, fear of loosing and wanting to keep, which leads to suffering!!!! 100% Buddhism which is understanding reality whith Pranja (wisdom beyond the mind but the heart)Read some zen Buddhist books, and you'll understand!!!The best movies ever, they are!!!!!That's the problem with you people!!! You don't understand, that everything is changing, all the time! You cannot stop the change, and if you hold on to things, then you will suffer, and you do!!!You buy a new car, you drive it for some time, it will have problems (sooner or later, fall ill) and die!The same with people (Life, Age, Sickness, Death)!And that is true for everything (all matter), may it be in the microcosmos or macrocosmos! And because you want to hold on to your found meomories, of the original trilogy, and cannot accept the changes, which he totally has the right to make, so you complain and suffer!The original trilogy was great, when it was originally released, but it would, and does still look ridiculous today, because things have changed (Tecnology, fashion,....) and he want's to use these new tools, to come closer to his original vision, which he couln't archive back then, because of the limited time, money, tecnical know-how and so on!So, wake up to reality, and eighter accept the way of things or go and watch ""the awesome"" (i'm kidding) Matrix, LOTR, Harry Potter or whatever!! Because those are truly art movies, extremely meaningful, and there's nothing wrong with those, right???Things ""you"" cannot change, you eighter accept, or let-go of, but not complain and whine like a 2 yer old girl!!Understood??? I truly hope you got it!!Ther is yet another thing i really wanted to tell you:Emotion is something natural, and all of you, at least used to have it too!!When Padme finds out, where her husband and most beloved one is going to (the dark side), then this would be heartbreaking for everyone, who's not made of stone or a buddha (full of compassion and wisdom), wouldn't it?? I mean, has none of you ever honestly loved anybody, or are all of you so afraid of true emotions and true feelings!!????!??? Are all of you ""Plastic People"" like in Frank Zappa's song!!!????Wake up to reality!!!!Anakin has turned into a machine and changed sides, just to save his love, and then to find out, that she died anyway, does this not justify a ""no"" sream!!!????? Are you acutally human beings??????????????And some peple said that: Decapitation is always cool!!!???!!!I'm sorry, but i was deeply shocked, when Anakin decapitated Dokoo!!!!! Because it was clear, that he did something very wrong!!! Cutting heads of, is NEVER a good thing, and that was the message in the movie as well, and very clearly!!!All of you, who think, killing, torturing, decapitating people and the like are cool things to do, then please get a treatment immediately!!!!! You're truly sick and dangerous!!!!!!!!It's only a movie, but if you watch a movie and don't invest emotion into it, then what's the deal????I don't get you folk's!!! You're so superficial!!!Just think, you would be in their situation, and i'm sure you would never find it cool anymore again, right???I found ep. III extremely emotional and tragical and sad!!!!It's the greatest tragedy ever!!!Especially when Padme arrives at Mustava, the duel and the emotional breakdown of Obi Wan, just after, cutting his Legs  and one of his arms off! So horrible!!!I'm not a baby, but i would never harm a living being willingly, because i'm vegetarian for life and couldn't even kill a spider!I would never touch a weapon, because i know, that killing never solves anything, only destroys and brings suffering!!Kill somebody else is killing yourself as well, because we're all one!And this oneness is greatly felt in Star Wars!!!Wake up and enjoy Star Wars for what it is:The best movie of all times, featuring: The best story, the best actors and actresses, the biggest exitement, the biggest tragedy, the best visual experience, the funniest experience, the most complex interwoven storyline, the most wisdom!!!!Shining examples of intelligence, wisdom and marvelous creativity!!!!!Thank you George!!!!!!!! And John Knoll, Rob Coleman, Dennis Muren and all the fabulous people, who were working on these movies!!!Thank you very much!May the force be with you!!"	5.0	The best movie ever, in context with all the other episodes!	2005-08-27	20	9	11

(I mean the REAL original 3, don't get me started on the ""special editions"")I should say hear that I did greatly enjoy seeing this movieThat said, I can now start my...LIST OF (most of my) COMPLAINTS1. Ridiculous dialogue between Padme and Anakin. (For more information on this see any of the 300+ reviews that talked about this.)2. To many attempts at humor involving the droids. (It smelled keenly of the Jar-Jar debacle)3. Far to much computer animation. I can understand them animating some of the more bizarre creatures but somehow even with all their bleeding-edge technology, the spaceships looked more ""real"" to me in the original 3.Now it would be very easy to blame all this on George Lucas...So that is what I am going to do. He is the obvious choice. (It's like he can direct and write extremely well (see original trilogy), he just won't.)Despite all this it will be worth it to go see it anyway, (I did not see it as another liberal lecture against George Bush, I have yet to see W shoot electricity from his fingers) so fork out the seven bucks (plus the lord knows how much for snacks) and watch it for yourself."	4.0	My Review (Yes, yet another series of shots at George Lucas)	2005-05-23	4	2	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AOXC7HI3O8JWI	"Carlo San Juan ""Caz MD"""	"Three words: It doesn't suck.Two more words: It's awesome.The circle is now complete.I am quite simply amazed.  It pays to go into a theater with low expectations but George Lucas had truly captured and portrayed in this film all I had wanted to see in the prequels.  And he did so in style.""Revenge of the Sith"" is a monumental leap from the previous two episodes and is by far the greatest among the prequels.  It is by no means a masterpiece but most faults from the last two films were done better and many things were just done right.Using all the powers he had with his digital fingertips, Lucas really made one beautiful looking film.  It's gorgeous, almost too much for the casual movie-going eyes.  It seemed every little corner of the screen had something to look at.  At times, however, it was too much and was distracting from what we're supposed to be watching.The battle of Coruscant was breathtaking.  As a viewer you're proverbially thrust into the action without the chance to gasp for air.  As an unfortunate result, the sequence loses steam early and you're left watching a fantastic scene without actually feeling engaged in it.  An example of such a sequence done right was in Episode IV, when X-wings were scorching down the Death Star trench you're kept at the edge of your seat at times, waiting and wondering if Imperial TIE fighters would suddenly rain doom on the heroes.  Nevertheless, the battle is immense and a wonder to behold.The characteristic Star Wars humor has finally returned.  In ""Attack of the Clones"" jokes felt flat and forced into the film.  Here, I actually found myself laughing.  It is the friendship and brotherhood between Anakin and Obi-Wan that kept me empathized with the film as they did their business with appropriate flippancy.  Heck, even the ""feisty little droid"" R2D2 gets his 15 minutes.  This little garbage can with legs steals the show and deals with trouble with the same resourcefulness as his Jedi masters.Christopher Lee returns as Count Dooku though his menacing demeanor in ""Attack of the Clones"" is gone.  He has disappointingly short screen time but the most is made of it.  The much-awaited General Grievous shows his mettle but his role is, while important, forgettable.Ian McDiarmid finally reveals his acting prowess as Chancellor Palpatine.  The strength in his portrayal is in his subtleties (as it should be for in film, really, less is more).  His seduction of Anakin Skywalker to do his bidding is masterful.  It's a star-making performance and I wouldn't be surprised to see him in more roles in the future thanks to the exposure from this movie.  Bravo!And yes, as we all know, the Sith get their revenge.  But even with this knowledge and anticipation to see how it all pans out, I found myself wishing it wouldn't happen.  As each Jedi fell I wished for deus ex machina, someone to ride the white horse and save the day.  Much like in ""Titanic"" when we all knew the ship would sink but wished it wouldn't.  That's how good it all came out.  The fall of the Jedi was heartbreaking.The love story.  The weakest point in ""Attack of the Clones"" was strengthened tremendously as Anakin and Padme now have actual on-screen chemistry.  However, it is still weak and cheesy but I'm glad it wasn't there too much as more pressing matters besides their love grew to the forefront.  Natalie Portman played her role very well, apparently making the most of what was given to her.  This is an Oscar-nominee and it shows how poorly she was directed by Lucas.  Her talent is, however, well-enough reciprocated by Hayden Christensen whose acting has improved greatly since Episode II.  Playing with fundamentals that seem straight out of acting school, his devolution from Jedi Anakin to Darth Vader is well portrayed.  At least well enough for a Star Wars movie.The much-awaited lava-planet duel between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader is marvelous.  It is fast.  It is intense.  It is technically mind-boggling.  But in all the fast and furious action there is no tension.  Instead of a heart wrenching battle of former best friends we have a great display of fantastic swordplay.  Which you feel is more important is your choice, but I would have preferred seeing more of the emotions behind it.  Nevertheless, toward the end we get a satisfying denoument which leads you right into the original trilogy.Perhaps it is best that the last two films were lackluster and flat.  If you had to watch all six films in chronological order, you'd have a steady increase in quality until Episode V.  Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, is a satisfying finale to the series.I do have a lot of nitpicking and philosophical ponderings which I will discuss later on.  But rest assured, if you're a Star Wars fan, you're gonna love this movie.  It is heartbreaking both in it's content and in the realization that this is the last cinematic Star Wars film.  I rank it 2nd in the overall series, just narrowly beating ""A New Hope"" and just losing by a nose to ""The Empire Strikes Back"".  It is well-made and a redemption of the franchise.  Even for the non-Star Wars fan this is a thrilling and entertaining film.  George Lucas did this one right, my friends.  Go see it.  Then you'll want to see it again."	5.0	The Force is strong with this one...	2006-01-21	6	1	5
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3BFKEJ0NMADSJ	"Carl Patton ""drcoolphd"""	First of all, I know that there are fanboys that are going to vote no just because they disagree.  But to the rest, let me just say that this movie is not only the best movie of this trilogy, but it does indeed run with the best of the first trilogy.  The lines are pretty simple and that's what makes Star Wars so liked worldwide.  It's easy for all members of the family to enjoy. The acting in this movie is really good. Hayden Christiansen steps up and delivers in this movie, as does Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor.  The best acting though goes to Ewan McGregor who not only nails his role as Obi Wan Kenobi but is the embodiment of everything Alec Guiness in this movie without being an impersonator.The story is great and makes sense if you look to the grand scope of the saga. The reasoning for Anakin turning to the dark side is well developed and explained in a very human fashion. If I had one complaint, it is that Count Dooku died so early.  In Episdoe II, I thought Christopher Lee was one of its highlights for he is a great charactor actor.  And even though he meets his fate early in this, he does go out in a characteristic blaze of glory (like Saruman in Return of the King, Special Ed.).Overall, a great movie that deserves to be seen. The movie is so well made that it seemlessly flows with Episode IV. So, where you rate it is your call.  But to me, it was definitely one of the better entries and that's a honor for a franchise to go out, for the time being, on a high note.	5.0	A Great End to A Great Saga	2005-08-04	8	6	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A63VIA3VPU3Q5	"Carl ""why did Lucas have to make Episode II?"""	Let's get it out of the way first. I love Star Wars. I'm not an uber-geek, but I know a lot more about Star Wars than the average person. And this movie is definently better than either of other prequels, and is a fairly entertaining movie on its own, but, unlike what the New York Times says, it is not better than the originals.Let's start out with the good things in the movie. First of all, there is a much quicker pace to this one than Episodes I and II with  less poor diologue, which is a very good thing. Hayden Christensen does a much better job of potraying an increasingly evil Anakin, but perhaps that might be because he is no longer supposed to be playing a hormonal teenager. He still isn't the best actor ever, but he improves. Ewan Mcgregor does a very good job of potraying Obi-Wan, and Yoda seems so real at times it's scary. But most importantly on the positive side, something that the new movies has not yet done, Episode III actually can get you emotionally involved in the movie, especially as Order 66 is carried out.It does, however, have its faults. One would be plot holes. Some stuff in this movie has just doesn't connect with the old Star Wars or plain logic. For instance, R2-D2 manages to do all this stuff that he couldn't do in the old movies without any explanation as to how he can no longer do it. Another example is how Padme would have die in childbirth in an age of advanced technology, while we can pretty much prevent it with modern technology. Speaking of Padme, Natalie Portman still fails to deliver. Which is weird, because she is supposedly a good actor in the other movies she is in. Perhaps Lucas just poorly constructed her character. She does seem to get her fair share of half-baked lines. Not that she is the only one. There are still quite a few, and sadly Darth Vader (in actual Vader suit) gets his evil coolness lowered with some. And it does feel like there has been a large chuck of time chronologically between Episodes II and III, it that isn't a good thing. You feel randomly thrown in, with new characters like General Grevious and references to events you've never heard of all over the place. I know that this would be limited if you had seen the Clone Wars shorts on Cartoon Network (which I haven't yet, but I plan on buying them), but it shouldn't be necessary to the comprehension of a movie to see an outside source.On the whole, better, a lot better, but I'd still rather see the old trilogy.	3.0	Vastly Improved...But Not Perfect	2005-05-31	10	5	5

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2JH0SGOYF5INB	"Casey D. Rhodes ""Boba Fleagle"""	"So let's get the obvious out of the way--""Revenge of the Sith"" is better than the first two episodes. That being said (and it's not saying much), let's move on to the review...First of all, let's eliminate the first part of the movie; that is, the scenes in which Anakin and Obi Wan rescue Chancellor Palpatine from the clutches of the newest CGI villain in the Star Wars saga--General Grievous.  If you read most reviews of this movie, it seems that most agree that they could've done without this sequence altogether and I tend to agree with them.  I really don't understand why, when it would seem that we're reaching a zenith of digital effects technology in film, that Lucas feels the need to 'wow' us by overloading the screen with his incessant need to prove to the world his films are the end all, be all of digital effects.  Who cares?  George, have you even viewed a film that's been made in the last five years?  We've seen it already.  It doesn't add anything to the film whatsoever.  You're not going to get any ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" from the crowd anymore.  You know what we really want?  How about some dialogue?  Oh, that's right, your 'Achilles' heel' in filmmaking has reared it's ugly head once again. The pacing, the dialogue, the useless comedic banter between Obi Wan and Anakin, combined with the innane use of digital effects, make for a pretty bad opening of a Star Wars film.  Let's just remove that for now, shall we?Now for the part of the movie that the critics seem to all like--the turning of Anakin to the Dark Side of the Force which, by the way, is what these first 3 movies were supposed to be all about, remember?  First of all, thank you, George, for sparing us from having to sit through more of that sappy, pseudo-romantic, banter between Padme and Anakin ala Episode II...at least not more than we can handle.  Don't get me wrong; it's there, but in much smaller doses.  I'll never forget the combination of 'moans' and 'chuckles' the following exchange got in the theatre...Anakin: ""You are...so beautiful.""Padme:  ""It's only because I'm in love with you.""Anakin: ""No...no it's because I'm so in love with you.""Oh my Yoda!  Are you kidding me with this?  Luckily, the sap ends there more or less and moves on to more important issues like, what IS that Chancellor Palpatine up to?  Tomfoolery?  Much worse, it would seem...I have to say that Ian McDiarmid's performance in this movie was fantastic.  Dare I say, oscar-worthy?  Yes, I said it.  Think about it:  when you are given a George Lucas script and create a performance out of it as powerful and convincing as his, doesn't he deserve at least a nod?  It's like MacGyver making a bomb out of a pencil, a rubber band, and peanut butter.  Amazing!  Although I feel that the overall pacing of the film from beginning to end feels a bit rushed (""Quick, let's get Anakin in that Vader costume before people leave!""), I was thoroughly convinced that Palpatine could convince a confused, ambitious, and troubled Anakin Skywalker to turn to the dark side.  Kudos to you and your evil plan, Darth Sidious!My favorite scene in the movie has to be the droid assault on Kashyyk.  This was the battle scene that I had been desperately waiting for that I did not get in the first two installments.  It had me reminiscing of the good ol' battle scenes on Hoth, except much shorter(quick pacing, remember?).Then there's the all important epic battle between Anakin and Obi Wan.  Hmmmm....still unsure about this.  Yes, it was climatic, I'll give you that, but, lava planet?  Is that necessary?  Does that make it 'hotter'? More epic?  No, not really.  Just more opportunity for CGI magic, thanks to the kids at ILM.  Seriously, Obi Wan and Anakin could've dueled in my back yard and I still would've been interested (trust me, my back yard is NOT climatic).So, in conclusion, you may ask, ""Gee, with all of your scathing criticism and negative comments, I just don't see how you still managed to give 'Revenge of the Sith' 3 stars"".  Good point, my young padawan.  And I guess this is where I am weak in my dealings with the force.  Look, I'm a HUGE Star Wars fan, I admit it.  I know more things about this saga than most nerds don't need to know.  But, I'm also a huge movie fan, so I know what works and what doesn't.  So, flawed as it may be, I still loved this movie, as I did the first two.  When it comes down to it, I am interested in this story, no matter how it's told.  I consider it the story of my generation.  How a good kid could become so evil?  Then, how does his son succeed in his ultimate redemption?  I love this stuff!

And yet, Lucas has pulls it off brilliantly!For the first time since the original trilogy, the plot is driven by the characters rather than the technology, and the result is stunning. Hayden Christensen, who plays Anakin Skywalker, carries the movie as he completes the transformation from the troubled young Jedi to the full-blown Sith Lord soon to be known as Darth Vader. Ewan McGregor, as Obi Wan, is the perfect Jedi foil for Anakin's insidious journey to the dark side of the Force. His grief and anger at Anakin's chosen path mirror the audience's as he cries out: ""You were the chosen one!""For that entire generation of Star Wars fans who grew up with the original trilogy, this is a exceptional treat. Lucas has seamlessly tied together the storylines in an emotional extravaganza that will have you both cheering and crying before the final credits.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2IUXZX5WJJBYQ	Cathy A. Rowe	"I put off going to see the film because I knew how it would end.  We all know that Anakin will turn away from Obi Wan and the Jedi and become the hated Darth Vader.  We know that the infant Luke and Leia will be raised apart by foster parents.  The film goes a long way to explain how this comes to be, but not in enough detail and motivation for me.  It seems to me that no matter who requests it, or how much pressure is brought to the Jedi council, they had no business approving Anakin being allowed to interact so closely with Palpatine, because it is simply too close to being involved in politics.The other thing I have a problem with in this last installment of Star Wars is the treatment of Padme.  Gone is the strong, eloquent former queen that was in the first movie, and the warrior and rebel in the second movie, and in her place is a mild, reticent pregnant woman who can only say repeatedly, ""I love you.  I'll stand by you.  Let's go away.""  That's not the Padme we came to know in the first two movies.Obi Wan leaving Anakin to die in agony was a travesty to the friendship these two men shared.  I can't beleive that Ben would not put him out of his misery and leave him to die as mutilated as he was. Even after the horible things he did in the Jedi Temple, he didn't deserve to die like that.The best thing I can say about this film is the photography.  It is hard to tell what is computer generated and what is real.I will definitely buy this dvd if only to complete the set, but it is definitely not the best in the series."	4.0	Good But Not The Best	2005-08-25	3	1	2

It seems the crew from this film was dedicated and talented and thoughtful, but the script was plain awful and had even talented actors like Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor gasping for air and not engaging the audience.This is the first film I have been to in a while where I was actually cringing in embarrassment throughout many scenes, particularly the romantic exchange in the bedroom between Padme and Anakin. It was so BAD.It was nice to see the story come to a head, but we couldn't take anything seriously it was so poorly written and directed.	1.0	The only thing this had were sets and costumes	2005-10-05	28	14	14
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AW97B68KGUANY	"C. Clark ""bigchris04"""	I am very pleased with how Episode III turned out. It certainly blows I and II away easily. The dogfights in space are nothing short of spectacular. There are a few annoyances with this film that can be and are easily overlooked. Hayden Christensen does a better job this time and seems more comfortable with the role of Anakin, whereas in Episode II he was clinging to Lucas's atrocious dialouge. This time he plays off Ewan McGregor and is a lot more relaxed with it. I could never understand why in Clones and now in Revenge Lucas could not do an effective love story when he has the blueprint of how to do it in Empire. While the chemistry between Christensen and Portman is there, its stomped flat by some of this restrictive writing of Lucas's. Clearly transforming into Darth Vader is going to cause anyone stress. Any villian is going to be overstressed, that's the point of being evil. When Anakin's turn is almost complete, Padme's emotion in pleading with him to stop is very strong and right where it needed to be. The workhorse of the film however is Ian McDiarmid. Lucas might as well call it Star Wars: Episode III - Palpatine off the Leash because that's exactly what I saw. McDiarmid was fabulous. In the original trilogy really doesn't go into the Emperor much, you just know that he's the boss. Palpatine takes center stage now as he assumes control of what's going on. He's cagey and crafty, then kicks it into high octane as he forges The Empire. While the story of the prequels is uneven. You definitely want to keep Episode III. and if you are a hardcore fan, you may want to try ignoring Phantom Menace and begin the saga with Clones. See if Attack of the Clones, both volumes of Clone Wars, and Revenge of the Sith will save you a few migranes.	5.0	All work and no play makes The Chosen One a dull boy!!	2005-10-30	11	8	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3IPEBN6ESBPEZ	C. Clark	"This film was the best of the three prequel installments. It was without a doubt the most action-packed. At last Lucas dispensed with the cute, fuzzy creatures, and moved back to what made Star Wars a classic--a story depicting the battle between good and evil.Finally Lucas shifted from the first two movies, where we were forced to ""like"" the annoying, tempermental Anakin (played by the irritating Hayden Christensen), and gave us leave to absolutely despise Anakin by the end of the third. Frankly, it was a relief to be able to watch the movie and hate the future Darth Vader.I never thought these words would ever come from me, but the movie was improved by the increase of violence. Lucas did not sugar-coat this movie. Again, finally, back to the original film's style. Although violence distresses me (anyway), I was glad to see that Lucas did not try to tone it down. He finally turned Anakin into the big, bad dude we remember so well.I was a little ticked off by a few errors in the story line. By the end, I was wondering if Lucas had completely forgotten what went on in the original series. I suppose he killed off Padme after she gave birth for dramatic effect, but any die-hard fan will tell you with anger that she did not die in childbirth. She lived long enough for Leia to have some childhood memories of her, according to Return of the Jedi.Would I recommend buying this movie? I would to a true SW fan, if only to keep a collection intact. Otherwise, I wouldn't necessarily call it a movie worth watching again and again."	3.0	Return of the Original Formula	2006-09-06	4	3	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1N00127IDBHD6	CConn	"I was, at one time, a gigantic Star Wars fan. I knew everything there was to know (still do, actually), but as the quality of the films fell with the prequels, so did my interest in Star Wars as a whole. To the point where I actually didn't even have any want or need to see Episode III. But then, following the days after its release, I was barraged with positive reviews from critics and raves from friends. The thought began to enter my mind that maybe, just maybe, I would enjoy this movie. ""ROTS"" would actually be a worthy edition to the Star Wars Saga. Sadly, I couldn't have been more wrong.While the plot actually seemed quite interesting in the comic book adaptation, in the film it's almost non-existent. And we seem to travel from CGI-loaded battles to tedious, poorly-written and averagely acted scenes without any reason or rhyme. This reduces even the action sequences to nothing more than boring, wastes of time. Despite the very large and iconic events that take place in the film, I couldn't help but feel a sense of utter pointlessness. Now, I'm not one to particularly have problems with sitting through movies, but by the end of the first hour, I honestly was praying this film would end...and quickly.That was the first hour. The second hour, I'll admit, is a bit more interesting (as it should be considering all that transpires in the time frame), but it's no better in terms of quality. This steams from the film's lead character himself; Anakin Skywalker. Lucas hurt the liability of this character greatly in AOTC by turning him into nothing more than, effectively, a whiny brat. In this movie, Lucas does succeed in making him ""evil,"" he definitely does. BUT, he does it in such a way that you don't feel sorry for Anakin one bit, his constant petty selfishness is simply too greatly for me (at least) to give a damn about him. By the end of the film, I wanted Anakin to die the firry death he almost succumbed to; he deserved it.Now, you're probably saying, ""isn't that what you're supposed to do when turning a character evil?"" Well, in answer, no, you're not. Yes, Anakin should be evil, should be a character you can hate. The thing is; (as an adult, at least) he was NEVER a good guy, never someone you could care about, never someone you thought SHOULD be ""saved"" in the end (of the Saga). So, thusly, once he does turn evil, you don't just hate ""Darth Vader,"" you hate Anakin in his entirety. Which again, seems to make the movie, and really the prequels, in general, a utterly pointless affair.The acting is, surprisingly, quite good. Or, at least, bearable. Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman turn in fine performances despite their intolerable dialogue. Ian McDiarmid became was disappointment for me though, as after he is ""revealed"" as the mystery Darth Sidious, his performance deteriorates to nothing more than a campy, over-the-top, entirely silly rendition of the Emperor. He might have well have painted on a mustache, and donned a trench coat he hams the film up so much. And, of course, there's still Sam Jackson, absolutely stinking up the place with his portrayal of Mace Windu, and, Hayden Christensen appears have not improved at all since his effort in Attack of the Clones. This is most depressing as, Christensen is, supposedly, the undisputed star of the film, yet he barely flickers. And I barely cared.I won't even go into the special effects or action, as its normal Star Wars fare as usual; fun and exciting fights and battles augmented with utterly pointless CGI, etc. I would probably be raving about it all if I were more intrigued by the story, but, since I wasn't, the effects became nothing more than Technicolored distractions.One of the things I was most looking forward to in this film was the cinematography; and even that let be down. One of the few things I liked about AOTC was its cinematography; its excellent blending of different colors and environments. Say what you will about AOTC, no one can deny, despite an overload of CGI, it was a beautifully shot film. ROTS, simply put, has absolutely none of that beauty. Some, particular scenes and shots are nicely done (the opening battle, Mustafar), but overall, much like its plot, the film's visuals are nothing more than a bland, tan-brown wasteland. A major disappointment.Lucas' direction is, of course, just as horrible as it has been for all of the prequels; absolutely no direction for his actors, and an overall lack of vision that, seemingly, has been missing since the days of A New Hope.I would like to say, overall, ROTS is, at least, watchable. That, despite poor filmmaking, it is a fun flick. But it isn't even that. It's boring; a struggle to watch, for me at least. Oddly, though, I have an immense desire to watch it again, not because I took any enjoyment from the film, but because I simply can't believe I could dislike a Star Wars film as much as I completely dislike this film."	2.0	And this is good...why?	2005-06-29	19	11	8
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2QOYGY2XJISKT	"C. Covington ""Lucas Fan"""	"I'm giving this movie a 5, because that's what it deserves.  If anyone paid attention they would have seen that this story played out exactly like Lucas wanted it to and my reasoning behind a lot of his actions are this.1.  First his remakes, a few years ago and probably sometime soon with an entire box set.  Why were they remade you ask, because the episodes originally released in 1978 and so on were ROUGH DRAFTS and thats that.  Anybody who's ever written a story or painted a picute would realize that you never make exactly what you want when you first finish, you go back several times and even then, you still might not be satisfied.  Plus, he's trying to create a real continuity between these episodes and the older episodes, hence all the changing.2.  The reverse in technology and why do the planets seem more primitive.  Why does it seem that technology has declined from episode 3 to episode 4?  It's common history, that when a nation falls to a dictator, every single resource goes to one place, the goverment.  Also the rebellion uses such shoddy crafts because what rebellion have you ever heard of that was able to use top-of-the-line equipment to take down their oppressers.  And the planets, where else would a rebellion hide in episode 4, 5, and 6, in the midst of the Empire, not likely.  They're safest bet would be that of remote planets that have little ""visible"" technology and seem to serve no supreme purpose.3.  How are the Ewoks able to help destroy the Empire.  Well, not because they're cute and cuddly but because of one simple term.  Guerilla warfare.  They didn't take on the Imperial Forces head on, yet they hid on Hoth and used that to their advantage.4.  Why is it that Kenobi and Leia's memories change from episode 3 and episode 4.  One, human nature, you forget things as you grow older and they even change over time, for example what do you remember that happened over 20 years ago that is exactly how it happened.  As for Leia's memories of her mother, who's to say those aren't of her adoptive mother, we don't know.  Memories change and there is even the known idea of false memories or memories that are planted when you're a young child.5.  Jake Lloyd.  What is the problem with Jake Lloyd portraying Anakin as such a young and free spirit in episode 1?  Nobody wanted to believe that this kid was going to help destroy the republic and Jedi Order but he did, get over it.  Think of this, nobody looked at Hitler at the age of 8 and went ""Gee, I bet that kid grows up and kills millions of people.""  It just shows that Anakin grew up with the same innocence that every child has early on.And last, those who say that Lucas has destroyed the story, remember, it was his story in the first place, so who's to say he destoryed it, he showed us what he wanted us to see."	5.0	Why doesn't anybody see this?	2005-06-05	7	5	2

He knew he could not fight Vader and defeat him, so why bother? And not only that, but Leia was being taken away IN FRONT OF LUKE'S EYES, and what does Luke do? HE FIGHTS VADER INSTEAD!

Luke never learns because he never listens - Yoda: ""Don't go to Bespin, don't bring your weapons in the cave, be patient, lift the X-Wing out of the darned pond!"" Pointless.Then The Phantom Menace... oh boy where do I start? How about I don't and just go to Attack of the Clones? First off, why did Jango shoot his changeling friend instead of just taking out Anakin and Obi-Wan? HE HAD 2 JEDI RIGHT THERE FOR THE TAKING AND WHAT DOES HE DO? He shoots that stupid woman! And what's up with Jango, anyways? Why is he hiring some girl to do his dirty work when he is a ""bounty hunter"" himself? More like an assasin. And why the hell didn't he just get that robot to shoot Portman instead of it shooting worms out? Oh, I forgot, Lucas wouldn't know how to direct and write a movie for the world.Now this movie. This is the worst movie of all time. WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. Next to Shawshank, Empire Strikes Back, Batman Begins and a few others. First off: Where's my Playstation 2 controller?No seriously, where is it?

After you beat the stage, you fight him one last time, this time it's harder and you get beat around a little. Then a little circle flash shows his weakness (his heart) and BAM. You win!Why did Darth Vader choke Padme? ""Because he's in the dark side..."" That's why the first thing he asks the emperor is if Padme is OK, right idiots? Not to mention the fact that Hayden and Natalie are extraordinary bad actors, rivaling Keanu Reeves and Paul Walker.""What have I done?!"" right after Anakin lets Mace die... oh and what happens next? HE TURNS TO VADER. That's right; after killing someone, he whines about it and turns to Vader. I thought he was going to be SEDUCED by the dark side - kind of like Frodo being seduced by the ring, except instead of a ring Palpatine's doing it. That's a great idea, but I forgot that Lucas is a fool and wouldn't know how to make a great idea anyways since 1977.Dumb movie.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AODPXDDXB1S4T	Cerrick Ganthor	Set during the tail end of the Clone Wars, the film starts off with a bang, as two lone starfighters careen over a first-generation Star Destroyer.  The seaming calm of space is suddenly shattered, as all hell breaks lose.  Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, in a series of aerial heroics, make their way for General Grievous' ship, which contains both the captive Chancellor Palpatine, and his captor, Count Dooku.None of the hype, nor the novel, could have prepared me for the bold leap this episode takes.  Right from the start, it's apparent that the story is altogether tighter, and the series has been returned to its original origins.  This is what most Star Wars fans have been waiting for, since the release of The Phantom Menace six years ago.Of course, I can't speak for everyone.  All I can say is, the dialogue, the acting, and the story's structure have all improved from the last two episodes -- though I don't hold a particular prejudice toward any of the films.  In fact, many would argue that this should have been the beginning of the prequel trilogy.  And there are still the critics who believe that if it isn't great literature, it isn't worth your time.The film is not what I'd call a crowd pleaser, although it does get a bigger applause at the end credits than the prior two films did.  It isn't something one can necessarily root for.  After the first fifteen minutes, which essentially sets up the rest of the film with outlandish humor from R2-D2, it's clear that this is less of a drama, pertaining to its roots as a Greek tragedy.  And the moments are dark.  Yet, they're done with such depressing flare, that you could almost feel a shiver ring through the entire audience whenever we got to a major plot point.  The music, along with the visual montages, aids this film in its purpose, taking us to a realm that has never been reached in any Star Wars film to date.  Its darkness definitely earned it its PG-13 rating, a first for the series.Impressively enough, Lucas doesn't leave any ends untied.  The film flows much more smoothly than Attack of the Clones, leaving behind the scattered checklist of plot points and ringing true with a more important, and more focused, story, as we watch Anakin's descent to the Dark Side.  And it goes without saying that, there really are no disappointments.  Some would argue that the film's climax came too swiftly, and didn't offer much of a lead-in.  But even they would have to admit, some of the material goes beyond what is usually accepted in a traditional Star Wars film.  Lucas cleverly scraped the surface when he did this.And one other thing I would like to note: for those who question George's directing ability, this doesn't seem like a George Lucas film.  And yet, he is credited as having written and directed it.  People are saying it's the best of the prequels, and it is.  Others go as far as to say that it's the best film directed by George Lucas; and in my opinion, that also is true, although it really depends on how bias you might be to the original trilogy.  And then there are those who go all out, and say it's the best of the six, and again, that's probably dependent upon what era you grew up in.  The Empire Strikes Back was great in its visual style, its victory in strengthening its ancient predeccesor, darkening the plight of the characters, and revealing to the world the true identity of Darth Vader.  Revenge of the Sith is simply better told, with a more in-depth, if not more emotional story, and it holds true with its array of classic trademarks: a gold-plated C-3PO, the appearances of Chewbacca, Darth Vader, and a decrepid emperor, an intense and rousing musical score, and a very satisfying, if not sad, climax that does exactly what Lucas promised it would: it cleverly bridges Attack of the Clones with A New Hope in a truly fashionable way, a way that can only be appreciated by the true Star Wars fans; not some old prune who thinks every movie should look like Citizen Kane and sound like a Charles Dickens novel.	5.0	He saved the best for last	2005-05-19	6	4	2

This one is entertaining enough, but IMHO, it's still surpassed easily by Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Sith is vastly improved by its PG-13 rating, adding a bit of edginess and more violence that it's long needed.Lucas went beyond the constraints of the typical PG- rated sci-fi, but he's still determined to make a movie that's under three hours.  This really undermines the character development, namely in that of Anakin Skywalker.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2DE249NY4SMSN	Chad Taylor	"We see that Anakin is a whack job in Episode II because of his feelings regarding Obi-wan and the counsel holding him back, but this is only in his mind and not in any Jedi masters intent.  We never see masters or Obi-wan really plotting against him, we never see why this guy is a few fries short of a Happy Meal and yet he is.  Yes, he's Oedipal, but is that at the heart of all his machinations?  My trouble with episode III appears to be down a similar vein.  Although, he is told by Palpapine, the obvious villain since the beginning, that Padma will die, Anakin has a total of 2 nightmares about her screaming her head off and this is enough to convince him to forsake all others?  Now 10, 15, 30 or 40 nightly scream sessions might drive me crazy enough to choose the Dark Side to save a loved one, but not 2.Even more disturbing, when he realizes that Palpapine is the Secret Sith Lord, why didn't he think, ""Hmmm, are Palpapine's predictions about Padma true or just a ruse to get me to submit to the Dark Side?"" Remember everyone realizes Anakin's abilities, but it never enters his mind.  Now He is supposedly the ONE that Jedi legends fortold of and yet he can't even imagine the newly uncovered bad guy may have been influencing him with the Dark Side the whole time?Finally when he faces off with Obi-wan at the end, he strangles Padma, eventually leading to her death.  Now this is the woman he wants so desperately to protect?I will probably buy the DVD because it does complete the final or missing episode, but it left me feeling very mixed.WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN BETTER IF:  Anakin would have had several (I mean several) dreams about Padma's death, even during waking hours so as to drive him to the point of insanity?  Wouldn't it have been better had Palpapine showed Anakin a way to soothe his troubling nightmares by using the Force, but not yet revealing Palpapine's true identity and letting Anakin know Palpapine knows enough of the ways of the Force to help Anakin save Padma?  Wouldn't it have been better if Obi-wan and Mace had discovered Palpapine's secret, Obi-wan battling him and witnessing the Senator killing Mace?  Then later when attempting to arrest him, have Anakin intervene because Anakin thinks Palpapine is still a good guy (and can help him save his wife?).  Then a battle ensues between master & pupil leading to the lava scene and later Anakin now as Vader then hunting down all of the Jedi?

This flick'd finally revealed the set-up and scenes in the Star Wars genre for its entirety:* How VADER (Anakin) came to be* Luke and Leia's birth* The Skywalkers's destined respective destination on their families to-be* Mace Windu's death (this one I've presumed and how it came to be, along with how Luke and Leia's birth)* The extinction of the Jedis* Why's the emperor's face wrinkled, and Vader's physical appearance became (with this one I've a 50% correct prediction, however I use to think that those who dwell with the dark side withers in their flesh cos the strong power surge of the Dark Force drains em - when it turns out Mace Windu actually toasted the Emper.. er, hope I'm not giving to much away for those who are yet to see it).*and yeah, who the emperor culprit really waswhich to my surprise- that although i've been able to decipher in predicting accurately some certain details in the SW plotline (perhaps with some use of the Force, or just maybe out of familliarity for being a Star Wars fan from waay the heck ever since at 6 years old in '78), still it did effectively thrilled me at some repects.Quite a pun it is when Christopher Lee is his character is addressed by Anakin as 'Count' before their inevitable battle to the death alongsides Obi-Wan (quite a rehash with Maul is it a bit, and a certain hint of Kenobi and Vader's battle from the first Star Wars flick). Notably, Peter Cushing (who appeared in the said first Star Wars flick on a prominent role beside Vader in operation on the first Death Star) and Christopher Lee, both appeared now officially in the series. Man, they could've met! (Wonder who'd be getting the stake this time.)NOTE: Take a closer look for the stand-in on the movie's last scene. Ewan McGreggor - pathetic as he might've appeared in that crappy feast-ala-pretensious movie MAULIN ROUGE - did an excellent job playing as Obi Wan Kenobi worthy in the footsteps of Sir Alec Guiness. Hayden Christensen is good in being the still-young Anakin Skywalker. And most notably of all, I guess Ian McDiarmid plays a great highlight with his character in this film. And further, I still prefer that classic Carrie Fisher look against Portman's thin and too young ambience.I guess the other side of em Star Wars fan(atics)- the 'Purist' (every genre has some i guess), I wish they'd cut George Lucas some slack in being too hard on the old guy. Though he may've faltered at some respect from the first two prequels (mainly on EPISODE 2)- this final installment shows mr. Lucas to've perhaps reconsidered the error of his ways, and although it may have never granted anything new to moviedoms universe like the original series have contributed in the history of Sci-Fi and the whole universe of the movie industry in its entirety, EPISODE 3 has its merit on its own.Quite intact that made me glad to see is that the whole FORCE theology went well in being intact with this one (which is mainly adapated from the christian ethical dogma the concept of the good against the dark side (which sadly Mr. Lucas during in an interview in a sloppy fat of excess out of his success have detailed as 'myth'), and the modern 90's style effects are well attuned decently with the scenes.So much so, shall we ever encounter the now considered pro-sequels being prospected for the Star Wars saga? Time will tell that we shall see - yonder to the days of further future history... May the Force be with Us.In passing ... lemme mention that working on a call center at one time recently I get to dial by random one of Toto's ex-vocalist Joseph Williams' dad John Williams phone, and had a brief phone talk with the geezer- he's a grumpy old guy.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A33IZJVCKFKDPU	Chris	"And so it finally comes to a conclusion.  I wonder what will happen to poor Anakin, Obi-Wan, Padme, and the rest of the Star Wars gang.  Don't you kinda hate going to movies when you already know what is gonna happen at the end, to everybody!This is the only movie of all of the prequels that George Lucas actually had to live-up to the expectations.  People let the first two prequels slide, saying ""Just wait for Episode III to come out.""  George Lucas better have been feeling the pressure to deliver, although he thought that the first two prequels were great movies.Basically Revenge of the Sith is the build-in to A New Hope.  Everything that you know will happen, happens.  Anakin becomes Darth Vader, the sith lord.  Him and the emperor make everyone turn their backs against the Jedi's and kill all but two of them.  Padme gets pregnant and gives birth to a boy and a girl (you know their names).  And a lot of big, expensive, CGI effect scenes take place and you have your finally to the Star Wars series.This movie was clearly the best of the prequels.  It has some dialouge that might actually be spoken by humans.  Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor both delivery very strong, emotional performances.  Everyone else gives an average performance.  The CGI Effects in this movie are some of the best that I have ever seen.  You can still tell that they are computerized, but they look stellar.  And finally the storyline for this movie was better than the other prequels, probably because there was a direction that Lucas wanted to go in this movie, as compared to the others where he was just trying to fill two hours of film.Now for my complaints of the movie.  First off, the beginning of the movie was way too long and way too slow.  This created a feeling that the movie was beig rushed towards the end and thats the part of the that the most time should have been focused on, which leads to my second complaint.  George Lucas did not spend nearly enough time on what these three movies have been based on: the transformation of Anakin from the Jedi's to the dark side.  Anakin becoming Darth Vador just happened with very little build-up.  This should have been the most emotional, longest part of the movie, but instead it just sorta happened.Overall, I would say that this a good movie.  I think people are saying that this movie is awesome because it is Star Wars.  Had it been just another sci-fi movie, then people would be saying that it is either average or below average.  One thing to consider with the prequels is that their is a really good story at the heart of all of the movies.  A story about a man's battle with good and evil, emotions and restraint, love and fear.  I just don't think that there was enough story here to make three movies from it."	4.0	Good Way To End A Legacy	2005-06-04	5	3	2

Best of the bunch, not becuase of dialouge or story line but because of special effects not available 28 years ago.  3 does tie the previous movies all together quite well and I was suprised by that.I literally asked for my money back on episodes 1 and 2.  I could actually see myself seeing the final episode a second time.  Don't get me wrong.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ	Chris Kennison	After watching Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith last night, I realized something.  The whole problem with the entire trilogy was story and choices of story.Revenge of the Sith is the juice of the story. It is what the other two movies were leading up to... but frankly, that's why the other two films STUNK. Because their entire reason for existence was SETUP!! They had very little story... LOTS OF FLUFF and no MEAT.We all know the outcome. We know that Anakin will become Darth Vader. This isn't a surprise. So, basically we had to sit through 2 poor films and one awesome one to finally get to the punch line which we already knew.I understand that the story Lucas had to tell was predestined, but I think had he condensed the first 2 films into one, shown more of the CLONE WARS and gotten to the Darth Vader punch line sooner, this would have been a much better trilogy.I mean... there's a whole lifetime worth of Darth Vader stories left untold.Well, Revenge of the Sith hits it out of the park. Better scripting. Faster. Darker. Wookies.From the opening scene, we are instantly ejected into a faster moving adrenaline ride of a movie. There's a sense of dread, urgency and fear that the first 2 movies didn't have. There is a tremendous danger and it's coming to life.The final scenes of SITH are gut-wrenching. The emotions that were lacking in the first 2 films are in the third.Absent is the goofiness of the first two... that bad child actor, Jar Jar, the stupid cafe scene, the completely unnecessary robot factory scene... in its place is necessary, relevant scenes that are exciting, dark, dread inspiring and finally a solid lead into 3 of the best films ever made.I think now... you can make that 4 of the best films ever made.	5.0	Well... it took 3 films... but finally....	2005-05-19	0	0	0

I found the movie too rushed and scenes left me wanting more.  It was like half the conversations were completely left out.  Not just conversations but entire scenes. Padame's role was pretty usless in the movie.  She had no spark.  My husband and I were confused at first thinking they substituted Natalie Portman with another actress.  She looked a little different and her voice seemed odd at first.  Not sure why.  As for the turning of Anakin to the Dark Side, it was only slightly hit upon what his internal war was.  It wasn't just Padame and if I hadn't read the book I would have been like, ""This is it? This is the only reason he turned?""  The movie basically fell flat for me.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AF26UCWNV8HVT	Christopher C. Rydo	"Yes, ""Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" is the best of the prequels, by a long shot.  It's not nearly as perfect as the original trilogy (Episodes IV-VI), but then again, few things are. Of course, after the last two, you weren't really expecting that, were you?  But again...""Episode III"" is a far cry better than either ""Phantom Menace"" or ""Attack of the Clones"".Granted, as brilliant a producer as George Lucas is, he's not so hot as a director or screenwriter.  That's partly why ""Empire"" and ""Jedi"" were so great; he employed others to take care of those things for him.  Now, although he once again handles the duties here on ""Sith"", he actually does quite a good job of tying up all the loose ends that lead into ""Episode IV"".  And right off the bat, just so you know, the last 30 minutes of this movie redeem any shortcomings that may occur int he first hour and fifty minutes or so.The visual effects are great.  Right from the beginning, the audience is plunged into a battle over the Republic capital of Coruscant.  Chancellor Palpatine has been kidnapped by the evil Separatists, led by Count Dooku and General Grievous.  Of course, Anakin Skywalker & Obi-Wan Kenobi are the only hope of rescuing the Chancellor, and they do so, after what virtually amounts to a 20-minute non-stop battle sequence(incidentally, when did R2-D2 learn to fly?  And why can't he do it anymore in ""Episode IV""? OK, so maybe not ALL of the loose ends are tied up... ;) ).Now, after this, things do drag a little bit.  There's an awful lot of gabbing, done mainly to fill the audience in on the ongoing war, and the growing distrust of the Jedi Council for the increasingly powerful Chancellor Palpatine.  Palpatine, in case you haven't figured it out(and it's surprising how many people hadn't even after the ""Attack of the Clones""), is really Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord bent on ruling the galaxy.  And, of course, he's pegged Anakin to be his new apprentice.  As even a casual Star Wars fan, you know he's successful, but watching the transformation of the beloved, seemingly compassionate Chancellor into the diabolical Emperor is definitely the most compelling aspect of this entire prequel trilogy.  That being said, Ian McDiarmid(Palpatine) absolutely steals the show.  While little more than a supporting character in the previous two films, he rises to the occasion here as the source of all evil and the cause of all the galaxy's problems.  If MTV doesn't give him a ""Best Villain"" nod at their next Movie Awards, there's something seriously wrong with the world. And while the much-anticipated ""Anakin vs. Obi-Wan"" lightsaber duel is impressive, I'd say ""Emperor vs. Yoda"" steals the show!Which brings me to the last half an hour of the movie.  It ties everything together quite well, and almost makes you forget about the last two movies of this God-forsaken prequel trilogy.  Well, almost.  That's why, despite some of the boring dialogue and what not, this movie still gets 5 stars from me.  It does a pretty good job in actually explaining what the Sith are, and again, Palpatine steals the show, whether it be in his manipulation of young Anakin or his subsequent transformation into the Emperor.  Even if you swore you would never see another Star Wars movie after ""Attack of the Clones"", watch this one through to the end!  You won't be disappointed!"	5.0	The Best of the Prequels By a Longshot	2005-08-19	6	3	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1EO5YR1238VL3	Christopher Fama	"I was determined to wait for this movie on DVD to see it, but after hearing a bunch of ""it's so much better than the first two"" I buckled in and went.  Once again, I found out that the service of a memory weighed in more than the actual quality of new product for fans easily subjected to a Jedi mind trick, again.This movie isn't better than ""Episode I"" or ""II"" - it's as bad or worse.  If you think more screen time for Hayden can help anything, the force runs kind of weak in you.Here's what we have:  a lot of chaotic action sequences stringing together the main plot point; Darth Vader turns to the Dark Side to save his wife and children, doomed to die at childbirth.We see how Darth Vader came to be.  Sounds great, right?  But Hayden's acting, already horrible at best, sinks further and further into deliveries that would shame a high school student - just in time for the all-important transformation.  With all of the money spent on this film, would a few more takes to get a credible performance for the finale broken the bank?The Emperor also has a large part in this film.  I loved this character in Return of the Jedi, but he is stripped of all his power and poise in Sith, becoming more pedestrian as the plot plods on. In fact, die hard fans will easily recognize signiture lines in this film, lifted from Jedi.  I was embarassed, frankly.Oh - and I almost forgot - Annakin kills a bunch of ""Youngling"" Jedi.  (This has gotten a lot of press.)  What they forgot to tell you was this was the first and last time you ever saw the Jedi Youth.  Deaths only have inpact when the characters mean something.  I was sitting there thinking, ""it could have been worse, he could have made them watch this first."""	1.0	Toy Merchant, Not A Director Is He	2005-05-31	38	22	16
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A4LLXH0IZ3LMQ	"Christopher Forbes ""weirdears"""	I've come to view the Star Wars franchise as a giant amusement park ride. It's thrilling but fairly lightweight. And the thrills of the new trilogy have been fairly middling. So I was looking forward to the new movie with some trepidation. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that this movie might indeed be the strongest in the entire series, and certainly the only one with a true sense of dramatic tragedy.Careful....this review may have a few spoilers so be warned.I don't want to oversell the film because it is still sort of flawed, but I think what made this one work for me is the same thing that made Empire Strikes Back work for me....those two films were more about character development than many of the others and had alot of darker elements. Sith is clearly the darkest of the entire franchise. It's actually a tragedy in the true sense of the word....almost Shakespearean in plot if not in actual dialogue. Unlike the first two episodes, in this one I actually began the film liking Aniken, partly I think because Hayden Christiansen is a much better actor now than he was when Clones came out. Marlon Brando he's not....but he's improved immensely. For the most part I bought the conflicts in his character and his transformation to the dark side. TThe only big issue I have is that the key scene where he saves Palpatine from Samuel Jackson was underwritten....they gave him several motivations for his turning to the dark side but the key one I thought was the love of Padme and this ended up underwritten in the scene. Could have been fixed with just a little more work. Instead they focused on a misplaced loyalty to Palpatine as representative of Republic. When it was clear in the scene that Palpatine was no longer a republican, that misplaced loyalty should have been dissolved. Instead Anakin pledges himself to serve Palpatine. It jolted a little. Had they just done a little more with the Padme-Death line this flaw could have been overcome.For my ear actually, one of the biggest flaws of all the SW movies has been stilted dialogue. I think that in this department Sith is the clear winner over all the other movies in the franchise. The dialogue isn't stellar, but it's much more natural and cadenced than anything else in the series.The special effects were of course the reason to see any SW movie and this one outdoes anything else in the series as well. I thought particularly that the computer generated material was much better than in either of the other two in this trilogy which I think reflects the immense improvements in technology since Clones. The integration between live action and computer generation in this movie is nearly seemless, which for me was never the case with the others.I also thought....again not to oversell it.....that the movie wasn't complete mind candy....there really are some interesting ideas in the film about democracy and totalitarianism....and about the nature of good and evil....that are more convincingly portrayed in this film than in any other one in the series.

Given the fact we know what's going to happen the movie does a good job at making the transition compelling. I think Anakin's transition  to the dark side is a little shabby, but it still works. It's ultimently a very dark story, and it earns the first PG-13 rating in the Star Wars universe. Now I'm one who actually liked The Phantom Menace, but for those who didn't I think they'll find this one fixes a lot of the porblems of that decent albeit flawed piece.	4.0	The best of the Star Wars prequels.	2006-01-26	4	0	4
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1CYOHNGQ1WED1	Christopher Hivner	The opening scenes of the film are exhilarating. An incredible battle going on between an uncountable number of ships in all shapes and sizes. Obi Wan and Anakin trying to save Palpatine. The first minutes have a little everything. Great action and special effects, humor, well-choroegraphed fight scenes. I thought, finally Lucas has gotten it right again. And then the movie ground to a screeching halt. Anakin and Obi Wan talking. Anakin and Padme talking. The Jedi council sitting and talking (for people with so many special powers, they do a lot of sitting around and talking), Palpatine and Anakin talking. In the first 3 movies, the Senate and other things political were mentioned, but you never saw them. Why Lucas thinks that 20 years later what we want are scenes of a galactic C-SPAN, I don't know. The Senate is boring. Politics are boring. Anakin and Padme trying to be lovey-dovey with each other is boring and the dialogue and acting are terrible. I know Natalie Portman can act, but you just can't do anything with dialogue this bad.The action eventually picks up and you get more cool scenes, like when you see how the Emperor becomes so disfigured and the final fight between Anakin and Obi Wan. And of course when the suit and helmet first get put on and we see the Darth Vader we all remember from the first films.Parts of this movie are great and parts are terrible. I don't know what happened to Lucas in the years between the two trilogies but he forgot how to tell a cohesive and interesting story and the fact that he can't write dialogue for crap. It's a good movie and I'd actually like to see it again for the good scenes, but it could have been better.	3.0	Great action, terrible pacing	2005-06-17	1	0	1

I didn't see the first two movies about Star Wars, but I can tell you that this is silly and a waste of time.First of all, it's all about people fighting each other with swords made out of lasers, which is not very realistic--even in the future (when this is supposed to take place). Also, there are a great deal of creatures and robots that are not very good actors, except a hilarious fella named Jar Jar Binks (give that guy more screentime!)The human acting is really phenomenal, but lightweight effects and a not-too-well-thought-out story makes this movie too terrible, and I can't imagine there will ever be a Star Wars 4. If there was one, though, they might want to put Tim Allen in it, because he's hilarious.	1.0	Star Bores	2006-07-10	23	6	17

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A14CLNK8XAFL8O	Cipher	Revenge of the Sith rappes up George Lucas' famous collection of sci-fi movie madness that captivated our minds for around 30 or so years.Revenge of the Sith shows the birth of the empire, and how dark side twisted the prosperous minds of young jedi(Anakin). The movie begins when Chansoler Palpatine is captured as a hostage by the CIS(the droid army). The republic has some big battle over Coursante and send our 2 fav. jedi out to rescue Palpatine from a new menace, Genral Grevious. After Anakin and Obi-Wan save Palpatine, Anakin keeps havin' 'visions' of Padme dieing in childbirth, making Anakin very frantic to find a cure, even if it means the lure of the dark side...I found the movie very rich in speacial effects, like all Star Wars movies. But in my oppinon why it was rated 13 and up is because it is a little bit disturbing to see Anakin kill the jedi children just cause their in the way. But also, I found it kinda corny that after Mace dies, Anakin starts crying cause he killed Mace, but then two seconds later turns into a sith apprentance. But overal, it's an essential for all movie lovers.	4.0	No title	2006-04-18	1	0	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2X8KN82L07RSK	C. Johnson	This movie is the best of the 1st three prequels of the Star Wars story.  Our hero Anakin and Obi Wan save Senator Palpatine from Grevious' ship, but Grevious manages to escape.  Upon returning from the mission Anakin is greeted by Padme who informs him that she is pregnant.  They decide to hide the pregnancy from everyone else while they decide what they should do.  In the days to come, Anakin starts having nightmares of Padme dying in childbirth and thirsts for even more power that would allow him to stop her from dying.  His thirst for power begins to go against everything that Obi-Wan has taught him and eventually consumes him, turning him to the darkside of the force. I will stop right here and won't give away anymore of the storyline for the handful of poeple that haven't seen the movie or know anything about the Star Wars universe.In my opinion this is definetely the best out of the first three star wars movies.  The special effects and sounds were pretty good.  But comparing the sound to LOTR I would have to honestly say LOTR is superior in the sound department.  I also noticed that in the first scene where they are flying to Grevious' ship, the sound effects and dialog seemed to drown out the BGM more than I would have liked.  I orignally thought that there was no BGM playing but I listened closer and noticed that there was some music playing, just very hard to hear. I thought it was my receiver at first, but LOTR did not seem to have this trouble at any point in the movie.And while the acting was very good in my opinion it did not seem to be on par with the acting in LOTR.  This is forgivable, because I have always been a HUGE fan of the Star Wars saga and I could care less if none of the actors got an Oscar for their role.  It was a excellent movie overall and that is all that really matters to me.This movie did a very good job in tying up the loose ends between episodes 1 - 2 and 4 - 6.  While it was very sad to see Anakin turn to the dark side as he did, the scene in which Anakin becomes Darth Vader could not have been done any better.  Leading up to this unforgettable scene, the tone of the movie gradually went from light to dark.  The final fight scene(s) between good and evil were two points of the movie that vividly still stick out in my mind.Without spoiling the movie, I will say that the movie's ending was very sad compared to Episodes 1 and 2, but this may be one of the things that makes it great, besides we all knew it was coming.This movie gets 5 stars because it was so well done.  Many my argue that Episode I sucked, and Episode II while a bit better still wasn't up to par, but I don't think that there can be any disputing that Lucas certainly saved the best for last.  I could watch all of these movies over and over again which I plan to do in the near future.  Its actually kind of sad for me that Revenge of the Sith will be the last Star Wars movie ever made, but this is a good thing in a sense because I fear that if more movies were released they will not be as good as the original trilogy (4-6) or episodes (1-3)	5.0	Anakin is no more......	2006-04-25	3	2	1

While watching the original trilogy countless times, I eagerly anticipated the release of the prequel movies. `Sith' is remarkable and spectacular.The innocence Anakin once portrayed is now gone and replaced with a cold, merciless desire for power. Friends become enemies, democracy dies and hope is shattered. `Sith' delivers what we've been creating in our minds all these years: the subsequent annihilation of the Jedi Order, and the fall of Anakin Skywalker to yield the rise of Darth Vader.Duel after thrilling duel transpires, including the climactic one between master and apprentice. Yoda's lightsaber skills are again used, but for a dire purpose. Yes, the Jedi do meet their end in this movie. There is a haunting and eye-opening scene about half way through the movie where we are taken from planet to planet watching all the Jedi we have come to know these past six years meet their untimely demise. The plot to destroy the Republic and the Jedi unfolds and all the questions asked years ago are answered.The highlight of the film was once again hearing the mechanical and chilling breathing of Vader. Accompanied by the charismatic voice of James Earl Jones, we are once again enthralled by the familiar Darth Vader from the original trilogy.`Sith' will leave you rushing home to immediately watch the rest of the saga; complete, perfect and magnificent.	5.0	Sith Delivers	2005-07-09	12	10	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AJT0EYLB3P85L	clambucket	"After viewing the horrible atrocities that were the first two movies, I vowed that I was done watching these new star wars fiascoes.  After hearing how episode III was the ""best of the series"" or how they ""had finally gotten it right"", I broke down and watched it.Like many star wars fans, I grew up with the original movies and cherished them dearly in my youthful years.  I don't consider myself a star wars nut or fanatic, but I do have a warm place in my heart for the original movies.  Perhaps it is because thinking about the originals takes me back to a time when I was an innocent pawn of the marketing giants and played blissfully unawares with the figures, creating my own richly elaborate plays of death and heroism.  Perhaps it is because these creations were based upon the movies themselves which somehow captured my imagination.Sadly, that mood was not recaptured with the new trilogy.  I think that, in the end, that was why I watched all three of them.  I somehow hoped that the magic would be rekindled and that I would be transported back to happier times and filled again with the wonder of childhood.So, is it really the fault of the movie that it sucks?  Or is it my own beaten and cynical viewpoint that is to blame.  I don't know.  All I know is that this is not a movie that I would consider well put together.  I don't like wasted scenes or characters and this movie has plenty.I think this stems from the fact that it tries too hard to tie in to the original series.  Does yoda really have to go to wookie world and bid a fond farewell to chewbacca?  Does C3PO and R2D2 really have to be in these movies?  What point do they serve?  I can only be thankful that Jar Jar has only about three seconds of screentime in this one.  But really, couldn't he have been brutally murdered somehow?I can't explain it, but I started out kind of liking this movie, but as it wore on, it became tiresome.  Once again, I can't really explain myself adequately.  All I know, is that if you're a star was fan, you probably, like myself, will have to watch all three of these movies.  There is nothing I can say that will help you to avoid wasting part of your life on these things.  I can only caution you not to buy them outright.  Rent it first and then decide.  It is this caution that may save you some hard earned money.  But nothing will save you from the sadness that a wonderful series from your youth has been horribly corrupted and will never be the same again."	2.0	I wish I had followed my first instinct....	2006-09-18	9	5	4
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3U6ULTAKCT341	ClassyFrank1701	Lucas has finally lived up to his true directing potential.  This movie was absolutely brilliant and was better than the original Star Wars (A New Hope)! Like usual, most of the dialogue is not very good, but the movie makes up for it in the amazing lightsaber battle sequences.  The special effects are phenomonal, especially for Mustafar and Kashyyk.Additionally, the acting is muchh better in this movie than in the previous two.  Indeed, it has some of the finest acting of all of the movies.  Hayyden Christensen and Ewan McGregor's acting skills have improved tremendously since II.  Natalie Portman, however hot she may be, has, unfortunately, once again proved that she can't act. What really saved this movie, however was the performance of Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine/Sidious (Sorry if I just ruined that for anyone who didn't know). His performance was brilliant and dominated the movie.John Williams also did a fantastic job with his score for this movie, bringing in themes from the two previous movies as well as from the original trilogy.  His piece for the two major battles (Yoda vs. Sidious/Palpatine and Obi-Wan vs. Anakin/Vader).Finally, this movie does a terrific job of tying up all loose ends that had to be tied up to connect the two trilogies.  It is a spectacular ending for the Star Wars saga and is worthy of being called Star Wars.There are only a few things I'm disappointed with, but I won't post them here because they are spoilers.If anyone's interested, here's my ranking of the Star Wars saga:1. The Empire Strikes Back2. Return of the Jedi3. Revenge of the Sith4. A New Hope (The original Star Wars)5. The Phantom Menace/Attack of the Clones	4.0	Brilliant!

After all, I had heard great things from friends and critics alike.This might have made my expectations too high, but I was not very impressed with the movie. I had hoped for something classic, but what I saw was a by-the-numbers movement from Attack of the Clones to A New Hope, with nothing that really seemed creative.Granted, this is better than the previous two. There were several great scenes, Yoda looked better, and Hayden Christiansen's acting wasn't as painful as last time. ""Better"", though, wasn't enough to overcome Anakin's contrived turn to the dark side. He listened to a Sith (a liar by trade) and went bad because he believed it MIGHT help him avoid the CHANCE that his DREAM could come true and his wife COULD be in danger.Just let that sink in for a moment.Revenge of the Sith is a decent movie, and Lord knows the best of the prequels, but it feels like the first draft of something that could have been great."	3.0	Not as great as I've heard	2005-07-02	9	3	6

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"The last 3 Star Wars movies reminds me of finding out an old friend of mine was unavailable. I found out by overhearing her gushing to her friend about her engagement ring. You see I heard what I wanted to hear(whether I had a chance or not) but I found out in a way I didn't want to. And so it is with the Prequel Trilogy: we find out what we want to know but it still doesn't feel right.  You're kind of like ""is this really the way to tell this story?"" Episode III is certainly better than I or II but still, it just almost makes it past Empire.The entire 6 episode saga of Star Wars is mainly about Anakin Skywalker, his rise, fall and redemption. Here, we have his fall. Anakin, growing increasingly confused over unorthodox Jedi requests and a meddling Chancellor ends up putting him in an odd position. And nightmares of his wife Padme dying in childbirth aren't helping things either. So he decides to pursue alternative methods of power, namely that of the Dark Side.The film opens with a simple shot of 2 spaceships racing along the edge of a big one only they swoop down and we realize they're in the middle of one big ****ing battle. It's a pretty long shot too. Once all that's cleared up we have Episode III's biggest shortcoming: non-story scenes. Scenes with Anakin talking to Padme about things or Obi-Wan discussing Anakin just don't gel. This all changes when Anakin finds out the truth about Chancellor Palpatine, then the film gets really better. Then of course it slows down then picks up. The pacing is extremely off in this film.One thing that Episode III has is memorable images: Anakin showing off his yellowish eyes for the first time, Order 66, Yoda taking on the Emperor and destroying half the Senate Chamber in the process. And of course what we're waiting for: the climactic showdown between Anakin and Obi-Wan Kenobi, his mentor.Some things just seem a bit too convenient such as Anakin making his turn happens quite quickly. And when Padme gives birth to our favorite Skywalker kids, she just names them out. There's no thought or ""hmm....wonder what I can name this baby?"" it's just Boom. Luke. Boom. Leia. And of course there's stupidity running rampant. For example, why didn't ANYONE know Padme was carrying twins? And the ""she's lost the will to live"" is just stupid. Or when Anakin or Obi-Wan are fighting and Obi-Wan is higher than Anakin, why didn't Anakin just float downstream a bit THAN get on, rather than jumping over?Of course the action scenes rock(but some with the dramatic thud of a paper airplane) but what about the love story, since that's what causes Anakin to go all Darth? Well same as last time: it sucks. Anything with dialogue such as ""hold me like you did by the lake on Naboo"" or ""Anakin you're breaking my heart"" is just cringe-worthy. In fact, the notably better love story scene is where they stare at each other from distant buildings(this scene is too eerily similar to Apollo 13). This holds more resonance than any gushing I love you scene.Disappointing are the extras. Instead of the excellent Beginning documentary from Episode I or the 2 documentaries from Episode II, we get an hour-plus documentary on one frigging minute in the film(the Mustafar duel). It's set up so that they show how many departments worked on it from costumes, rotoscoping, cameramen, editing, sound, music, compositing and many more, even catering. The sentiment's nice but it comes off as slightly silly, I mean one minute on one scene? What about that kickass opening? The Yoda fight with the Emperor?Sure it's no Empire but it ain't Clones or Return either. This film's noticeably darker and even better. Oddly enough, the prequel trilogy got better and better with each installment with III being the best. Too bad."	4.0	Better than the last 2 and I hate to say it but it's probably second best overall	2005-11-03	3	2	1

And SW wasn't uncool in the craze that went after. Everyone I knew up and down the streets, neighbors kids , everyone was into SW and the adults were eating it up as well. My neighbor's kids had almost a hundred kenner figures. I only had one figure and an X-wing. People were buying the soundtrack like crazy.  Kids were reading the picturebooks during recess in class. Games would be played in which kids would boast who saw it how many times, and bet who can recite every line by line of the movies. Think at that time, the Atari 2600 game machine still hadn't come out, folks were listening to LP's.  The Police and Sting hadn't entered the scene yet. Most everyone had a TV-ear antenna. Sound systems were crappy and monoaural and then came SW which seemingly blasted entertainment ahead 20 years. I bet the fandom for the movies was just as big as teens now with their Xboxes and/or keeping up with their buddies on getting the latest 3D video card. The morass of entertainment products today was basically nil and stuck to lousy tv shows and lps in 1977. Kids played outside , went to Halloween walks, people jogged and rode bikes without being heckled by drivers. You left your door unlocked in nice suburbs. Iraq was then the U.S. ally against Khomeni and Iran. So seek a better understanding of the classic entertainment SW was to us before Lucas screwed it up in the prequels.As for how Ep. III will turnout. I'd say there's a low chance it'll turn out decent. Lucas can't direct; he was good at creating a vision culled from the LOTR books, but a heck of lot more other people who not yes-men and real talent created the first SW not to mention Marcia Lucas' oscar winning editing.What needs to happen in Ep III is that it needs one or two standout performances , maybe from Christensen, Portman, or McGregor. Something to make the role like Depp did in POTC but not lunatic. Because Lucas has no idea how to direct actors into becoming characters we would be interested in. The actors will have to improvise or make their own directions. Filming again using total CGI backgrounds again is still iffy. The CGI in AOTC looked totally fake, blurry and uninteresting.

Nielsen	"Everything that was good about the original trilogy has been stripped away and replaced with heartless, visionless filler. The only thing I found satisfying about the movie is that it was able to tie into the original Star Wars . Most of it was boring. The script was atrocious. Lucas continued to make the same kinds of mistakes that I thought he made in the last two movies.Yoda played too big of a role.Dooku is a stupid name. So is Grievous. A caughing robot? Come on! Stupid! Almost as stupid as Jar Jar with his Jamaican accent.Jar Jar Binks appeared in a couple of scenes.Lucas showed altogether too many creatures and people and flying ships. The sparseness of the original Star Wars is what captured my imagination about that movie. Lucas failed again to realize this and destroyed the most interesting thing about the original Star Wars.The ""Force"" was demystified by ""mitochlorians"" or whatever they were called in the previous movies. The whole idea of the Force has been ruined. In this movie it is a mess.There were far too many BORING light saber battles. All they are is glorified sword fighting using light sabers which are not novel anymore. You've seen one of these fight scenes, you've seen them all, and there were far too many of them in this movie.The attempts to weave modern day politics into the script and the philosophical statements coming out of Yoda's mouth were moronic.Too many new inventions. So in the original Star Wars, technology actually decreased?Uncomfortable, melodramatic ""giving birth"" scene, along with awkward dialog.Ewen McGregor and Sam Jackson and Natalie Portman were all miscast. They should have gone with unknown actors. The fact that these actors are so well recognized detracts from the appeal and the immersiveness of the Star Wars universe.I don't think George Lucas is a good director.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A38U7Z88Q1MDWL	Cody Patton	"Star Wars Episode III-Revenge of the Sith is, I'm glad to say, the first movie of the Prequel Trilogy to truly live up to the hype. After the first two blew most people's Star Wars bubbles (I admit I didn't hate them as much as most), skepticism for this final installment (ever!:() reached an all-time high. Everybody knows the story (or they don't want it to be ruined) so I'll spare you the unnecessary summary/recap. The real questions are ""Is it any good?"" and ""Why should I believe you?"" Well, it is quite good actually and I should know or a great deal of my life has been wasted (some would argue that to be true anyway, lol). This has the meat, the payoff and the execution to make it all mesh. The acting is much improved, the lovey-doveyness kept to a minimum and the tone more suited to it's fan's actual age-group (hint: people over 12 probably won't be bored and/or disgusted this time). The action is, of course, superb in it's choreography, but this time they finally remembered to add in some passion and emotion as well! Overall, it is a powerful movie with only a few flaws, most of which are just ""I would have done it this way"" type complaints that I'm not arrogant enough to actually let ruin movies for me. George Lucas is the filmmaker, not me. That being said, Poor Mr. Lucas will probably never be able to achieve the emotional resonance of say, Lord of the Rings, but he did manage to whole-heartedly redeem this franchise and connect it with his old masterpiece trilogy, which was what was ultimately expected of him (Thanks George, for all of it!).Revenge of the Sith is suprisingly shocking in parts. The intensity of this film's climax is unmatched in the entire series and leaves one rather depressed, despite it's double-sunny, hopeful last shot. It is definitely dark and the evil is hammed up to the point of being bizarre in parts, which I rather liked! As far as performances go, Hayden Christensen is improved from Episode II and has the look down pat. Natalie Portman finally seems somewhat comfortable in front of a blue screen and is a pretty convincing cryer as it happens. Ian McDiaramid makes his Emperor from 1983's Return of the Jedi seem tame in comparison to this incarnation. As Palpatine/Sidious/Emperor he gleefuly overplays it to the max while retaining the ability to instantly transition from insane cackle to just plain menacing stare with that quiet sense of creep. Yoda makes his best appearance of the prequels. Sam Jackson get's his wish and doesn't go out like no punk. However, it is Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan who ultimately steals the show. His performance makes you chuckle (intentionally), cheer, goosebump and ultimately sympathize! He makes you believe in the Alec Guiness transition more than ever while making his own sizable claim to the role.Overall, Episode III should finally please the fans at the close of this classic 28-year saga. It's definitely got the goods while keeping the bad to a merciful minimum. Those who ""had a bad feeling about this"" will find their fears and past disappointments vindicated, for anyone who desires to have fun with the force one last time most certainly will.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AQVBOVE8P7K3J	Condor Libros	To call this one the best of the prequel trilogy is not to say that it's a good film. It isn't. For one, the characters and their motivations remain paper-thin, even obtuse at times. Anakin's motivations for joining the Dark Side, for example, wind up as clich&eacute; and are never believable (a flaw magnified by Christenson's wooden performance), while his love story with Padme is one of cinema's most underwritten.The film is also overstuffed with digital vistas and creatures, but Lucas is as clumsy a visual stylist as he is a writer and is thus unable to make any of it look especially good. And like its two predecessors, this film spends far too much time on the politics of the Jedi and the Republic. Here, Lucas seems to have forgotten what made the old films so good (minimal politics, real adventure, and characterizations that were better than average for space opera fare). Instead, he's gotten bogged down in his own mythology.And oh, yes: the scripted dialogue is still atrocious, even for B-movie fare (does Lucas actually think people speak this way?), and the performances are almost unanimously wooden. Only Ian McDiarmid, as the Emperor, comes through somewhat unscathed.	2.0	It's Wooden...	2011-07-09	7	5	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3AQDK1F0YQKAS	"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado"""	I saw this film on opening night at the midnight showing, and I left feeling rather impressed by what I saw. This is by far the best out of the prequel trilogy, which isn't saying that much, but nevertheless it's closer to the originals in terms of quality than 'The Phantom Menace' and 'Attack of the Clones'.The dialogue was an improvement over the previous episodes, and for the most part didn't feel anywhere near as godawful and corny, except for a few choice exchanges between Padme and Anakin.General Grievous was a rather impressive villain, in fact he had more of a presence than Darth Maul ever had, which is sad in a sense since Darth Maul had so much potential.Visually the film was a tour de force, far outshining the movies building up to this sensational climax of epic proportions. Overall I didn't get the sense that I was watching a CGI film, as it blended more seemlessly in with the surroundings and actors than previous attempts. It appeared that Lucas has mastered this aspect of the artform, finally.The cinematography was stunning, one felt as if one were really there in the middle of the dog fights in space or a spectator to one of the greatest duels of all time. Lucas succeeded with drawing the audience in and keeping the fans enthralled, in essence making the fans a part of the film.I was really disappointed by the Wookies' home planet and its indigenous population, rather the lack thereof since there wasn't all that much screen time devoted to this concept. That's one of the things I was looking forward to the most, seeing Wookies kick some serious behind. Much like Darth Maul in episode I, a horrible waste of a tremendous potential.The biggest dissappointment for me was Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader. Visually it was awe inspiring, but the actual emotional journey, the turning to the dark side and the succumbing to its power was not convincing, not only for lack of motive but also how the leap of faith occured.  It seemed as if Anakin's turn to the dark side occured at the click of a button rather than a slow, tortured and tumultuous trial.  I still feel that the casting of Hayden was simply the wrong choice. His acting skills are fine, but he just does NOT embody the essence of Darth Vader, not by a long shot.Light saber duels were outstanding and completely engaged me with the drama onscreen. Yoda in particular elicited alot of emotion within me when he worked his magic, but it's ironic that a CGI puppet works better than the main protagonist/antagonist, Anakin. The fight between Obi Wan and his protoge' was riveting and ultimately touching, seeing the end result as tragic as it was.As far as the movie's purpose goes, it succeeds in achieving what it set out to do, which was to set up the story for the original trilogy, and fortunately the ending was appropriate, a subtle yet effective approach.One last disappointment is how the Jedis died, I figured they would go out with more of a bang than a whisper. I realize that they were caught off guard, but nonetheless, they have the force with them so they should have sensed something was amiss, and taken out at least a few more of the enemy before fading into the annals of Star Wars history.A little more focus and development of the last Jedis, excluding the main characters, would have been a welcome addition to the final installment of the Star Wars saga because we still know virtually nothing of these intriguing guardians of the force.  They came, they fought, they died, but who are they?  I for one would really like to know, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.I particularly was pleased with the development of Emperor Palpatine whose transformation from his shell to his true evil form was right in line with how I'd imagined it would be. Mace Windu's role in that was poignant and his exit was quite memorable. Palpatine's presence was far more menacing than that of Anakin which I'd prefer to be the reverse, but he does end up being much of the saving grace of the film, since Star Wars is the ultimate battle between good and evil, and without a truly evil presence, there wouldn't be much to the film at all. The story development in this regard was also the most significant, as the audience learned quite a bit about the origins of the emperor and gained a fascinating insight into the dark side, which I'm sure many of us have often wondered about. I really could have done without the midichlorians again, though, because as far as I'm concerned, the force is a metaphysical concept which is immeasurable and cannot be reduced to a quantifiable amount in a petri dish.  In a Star Wars purist sense, Lucas' scientific attempt at explaining the force ruined much of its awe and wonder.  The Star Wars universe is one of imagination and magic, not one of skepticism and science.All things considered, I truly enjoyed the movie, and I'm glad to see that Lucas has learned from the mistakes that he made with the previous two films, for the most part anyway. A fitting end to a truly magnificent saga. Despite some of Lucas' failings in recent years, I think he has made up for his shortcomings and I must give him respect for wrapping up his story in a manner befitting that of a Jedi. George Lucas, thank you for an admirable conclusion.	4.0	The Best of the Prequels, However...	2005-11-10	14	7	7

They had terrible reviews about OVER acting and lame effects....they did great at the box office every time.  And thus Lucas started his millions, and began a trend of having the credits at the END of movies.OK, we all loved the first 3.  As a major fan of the series...I will admit...I did NOT like I and II when I first saw them...the more I watched them....the more they made sense. (I even like Jar Jar now...) You begin to understand how they acted and why they acted in certain situations...(my only acting complaint was Anakin's mother...ugh I was the ONLY person clapping when she died in II).  The Galaxy was a more ""civilized time"" during I and II.  People acted with respect towards others.  We saw the Senate for the first time...the weight of it's destruction in ANH further enforces the gravity of the situation.  Everyone in I & II had their place and acted accordingly with proper etiquette....other than Princess Amidala wearing the skimpiest of clothing around her ""bodyguard""...Ahem.  A little of the old SW attitude showed in II when Anakin and Amidala were being tied to the columns about ""rescuing"" Obiwan.  That civilized time and is about to become undone, to show us where WE all started the story back in 1977.  Characters will die.  It's going to be the bloodbath of the Star Wars universe.  It should be quite emotionally driven... the true hate for Obiwan from Anakin will fester new ""opportunities"".  Obiwan's character loosen up a bit in episode II...I expect Anakin to explode in fury... we'll see how well the actor can express the emotion.  I have no doubt this will be the best SW of the new 3 movies.  It should be the standard 2 hours theatrical bliss of all the other 5, but may just stand alone as the pivotal part of Lucas's whole Star Wars cannon.  He HAS to do this right...if not for the fans...for the story itself...or the whole Sextet is  broken.  He won't allow that.  We'll just have to wait and see, but I still think it'll be the best movie of 2005."	4.0	Let's think about this from an overview...	2004-09-23	14	6	8
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AB2Z4F37OUAXE	"Corey""handy""Beliles"	In my opinion, Star Wars Episode III was an excellent movie which is sure to be the biggest money-maker of the summer( if not the year). The acting in this film muchly exceeded that of the previous two( especially Ian McDiarmid and Ewan McGregor's performances). The special effects have taken a quantum leap and the design and look of the film makes you think about the original films and what classics they truly are. After seeing it, I went home and saw Episode IV which truly made me feel that the saga had come full swing. I really enjoy these movies and probably will for the rest of my life.	4.0	The Best One Of The Prequels, Possibly The Best Of The Saga	2005-06-05	4	1	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1S64KURC42A3K	"Cornwall Bucket ""Lurker"""	George Lucas is to be commended for his original Star Wars triliogy. They were films with heart and soul that spawned beloved characters.As for the prequels...well, we've all seen them. A CGI obsessed Lucas trades flash for substance and blasphemes his own creation.SITH follows the prequel pattern: A product devoid of any trace of what made the original trilogy so great: great characters you could actually care about and an actual focus on them.SITH is two hours of horrible acting, dialogue, and editing. The final scenes of Vader being encased in the black shell we know and love are absolutely horrible and unforgiveable. It is nothing short of blasphemy.If you love and cherish the original trilogy, if you spent years fascinated with the enigma that is Darth Vader, don't waste your time on this shameful, pathetic insult to what should have been.I'm completely disappointed.	1.0	PUTRID!	2005-05-21	35	12	23
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A39AWL2FKWDFK6	Cory D. Slipman	"George Lucas' finale to the Star Wars saga ""Revenge of the Sith"" is easily the best of the three most recent of his flicks, but still not on the same level as the original trilogy.  As usual the special effects are stupendous, the action continual and the dialogue campy and inane.  The love scenes and resulting conversation between Natalie Portman as Padme and Hayden Christiansen as Anakin Skywalker were preposterous in their effectiveness and sincerity.In ""Revenge"" we find Anakin and Obi-Wan Kenobi, his Jedi master, played in full Scottish accent by Ewan McGregor still at war with the clones.  Anakin, while accepted as a Jedi knight, is still considered too young to be considered a master by the Jedi council, which includes Yoda and Mace Windu played by a surprisingly wooden Samuel L. Jackson.  Anakin's marriage to Princess Padme is still a secret as is her just revealed pregnancy.Skywalker begins to dream, having nightmarish premonitions of the future, of the death of Padme in childbirth.  The schizoid Supreme Chancellor Palpatine played nicely by Ian McDiarmid, who is really the evil Sith attempts to seduce Anakin to the dark side of the ""Force"".  He promises Skywalker that if he foresakes his Jedi friends and adopts the ways of the dark side his beloved Padme will be saved.  This is the beginning of his transformation into super villain Darth Vader.  When he aids in the killing of the Jedi and especially Jackson as he fights with the chancellor his transformation has become complete.His altered personna alienates best friend Kenobe and his love Padme.  Padme eventually bears twins Luke and Leia who are spirited away under the guidance of Yoda and Obi-Wan to become the characters we are familiar with in the trilogy.The best part of the flick was the transformation of Anakin in to Darth Vader.  Anakin and Obi-Wan are having one of the many fierce light sabre duels on a volcano planet, which incidentally is by far the most impressive setting created for the film.  Anakin is left for dead, limbless and burned severly by the molten magma.  He is rescued by Palpatine now the scarred and dentally challenged emperor and brought to a medical facility.  There he is outfitted with mechanical limbs and the familiar long black cape and helmet containing that wheezy breathing devices.My only wonder is what George Lucas' next project might be as he very neatly ties up his ongoing plot in a very sensible conclusion to his lucrative and long term enterprise."	4.0	The saga finally comes full circle	2005-06-01	5	2	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AC8Y5IJOJZQWY	Cory K. Schmidt	"If this movie stood alone I would say it is fairly average and would have given it three stars. Of course it doesn't stand alone and when taken in context with the rest of the Star Wars movies I have to give it an extra star. It did a good job of tying up loose ends left between Episodes I/II and Episodes IV/V/VI.The good:1. Episode III captured some of the dark feeling that was so appreciated in The Empire Strikes Back and so lacking in the Episodes I and II.2. The action sequences were visually appealing but did not drag on like the podracing scene from Episode I. They were long enough to hold yur interest but not too long.3. The technology in this film really looked like it could have been earlier versions of the technology in Episodes IV-VI. it really established some continuity.The bad:1. Dialog. Of course Star Wars movies are held to low expectations in this department but some of the dialog in this film was downright laughable. A couple of examples are Padme saying, ""I'm beautiful because you love me."" (or something close to that, Obi Wan stating that ""Only Siths think in absolutes."" (which is itself an absolute). Most noteably is the scene in which Anakin is transformed into Darth Vader. He walks off of the operating table like a 1940's b-movie monster and then screams ""NOOOOOOO!"" while looking towards the heavens after hearing that Padme died.2. Questionable plot points. A few that come to mind are:- Why doesn't anyone know Padme is carrying twins? This seems ridiculous considering all the advanced devices that are present in the film, not to mention that no Jedi could feel this through the Force.- Why is Yoda the only one who seems to feel that something is amiss when the Jedi are starting to be massacred?- Why are the Jedi killed off so easily?- What exactly does Padme die from?- Why couldn't Anakin jump over Obi Wan in the final duel?3. All of the Star Wars movies have made a fortune in merchandise but this one in particular felt like a 2 hour long commercial for toys and video games. Many of the action scenes looked like they came directly from a Playstation game.Overall I was pleased with the movie. I agree with many critics that it was head and shoulders above the first tow prequels - though it would be really hard not to be."	4.0	Probably deserves 3 stars but...	2005-11-03	8	6	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ALM496CS05C6T	"Cory Ross ""Metal Meistro"""	"Alright,you have heard over a thousand reviews on this but what the hey, Ill throw in mine!!  When Lucas first anounced his intention to create 3 prequials to the Star Wars epics, it was met with a very mixed reaction.  The newer generation of fans seemed to generally appreciate the idea, while older viewers booed the notion, probably accurately labeling it as another Fox effort to milk the money making Star Wars machine.  Who is right? You decide.  I would, however, like to point out the sad little outcry of ""your destroying my childhood memories!!"" that was heard so often after the first film fell short of expectations.  Ill admit, taking a kid to see Jar Jar Binks in action has the capability of leaving some scars on their fragile psyche, but come on if a movie is enough to cripple the inner child, you need to evaluate whether or not that inner child is playing far too large a role in your ADULT life.  Anyways, on with the show.Episode 1:  For the most part, this film was a let down from the adult standpoint.  Keep in mind that it was geared for kids, which can save it to some extent.  The whole mediclorian thing was a total waste, and Jar Jar will continue to plague us in much the same way as Barney and the TeleTubbies, but if there is redemption to be found in this, and it is a lot of redemption, it is the end fight between Maul and his punching bags ""cough"" the Jedi.  Wow, awesome scene.  Whenever this movie graces my player, I generally skip to this part.Episode 2:  Right, I disagree with the general consensus on this one.  I found episode 2 to have all the elements the first one lacked, such as plot.  The acting was fairly competent for a Lucas film, with the exception of McGregor (ObiWan) who was great, and the whole clone concept was great.  The end scene was a finale worthy of Star Wars.Episode 3:  Alright, here it is.  Episode 3 was everything I expected it to be, which is the most violent of the Star Wars saga.  PG would not cut it for this one, considering you were dealing with the biggest fall to darkness in the history of story telling, and Lucas delivered.  I mean come on, you know your loosing some major Jedi brownie points when you go into a room and wax all the kiddie Jedi!!  As far as acting and dialogue are concered, again with the exception of McGregor everything was fairly sub-standard.  However, this did not bother me in the least.  Why?  ITS A LUCAS FILM!!!  This is the man that introduced Mark Hamill to the acting world, who still holds the record for worst scream of despair in movie history.  (Empire Strikes Back) Face it, you go to Star Wars for the epicness of it, the larger than life aspect, not the quality of acting.  Although I will say that Hayden carried a convincing role until his official turn, at which point his conversation with ObiWan right before their fight destroyed his evilness.  All in all, I was pleased with this effort, and felt it salvaged an otherwise half and half attempt at bringing the old magic back.  Oh, and the fact that Jar Jar was responsible for the rise of the Empire totally redeemed Lucas on that aspect!!!  Now if only we could blame Hitler on the TeleTubbies...."	4.0	The Force is stronger with this one!!	2005-11-11	5	4	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2O7XXGIOYVR8R	cousinpaco	"I really admire the courage of George Lucas.It takes a brave, brave man to spoof his own creation -- especially when it's a creation that became a worldwide cultural phenomenon like ""Star Wars.""And ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a sublime example of satire. In the original trilogy, Darth Vader was portrayed as a formidable villain with style and panache -- not to mention a wicked sense of humor (his sarcastic threats in ""Empire Strikes Back"" are both humorous and chilling). We're told he helped the Empire ""hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights,"" which implies that his power and command of the Force are prodigious -- perhaps even greater than Yoda's.Lucas must have found it amusing that the VILLAIN of his movies became such a pop-culture anti-hero celebrity, so he decided to undermine the character (much like the ""Silence of the Lambs"" sequel did to Hannibal Lecter) by turning Vader into a whiny, creepy, sniveling wuss. In 'Revenge of the Sith,"" Vader blindsides Mace Windu (but leaves the real dirty work to Palpatine), he kills a bunch of kids, and murders a bunch of unarmed diplomats. Yeah, he beheaded Count Dooku/Darth Tyrannus, but really, even the SCRIPT implied that Dooku was long past his prime.Best of all, when we finally see Darth Vader in full iron-lung armor, he clomps around like he's just had an intimate encounter with an Imperial Probot, and instead of strangling an officer or something, he asks if Padme is okay like a lovesick seventh-grader. And the final line of James Earl Jones-voiced dialogue we'll ever hear is not a foreboding declaration of evil -- instead, we get ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!""It's hilarious and inspiring to see Lucas deconstruct his most enduring legacy in response to the overblown status he achieved in the first place. For an artist to be able to confront his own success with pith and irony fills me with awe.Wait -- what?He WASN'T spoofing ""Star Wars""? He was SERIOUS?!?"	5.0	BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!	2005-11-07	14	11	3

It inspired me to buy the latest DVD set which had the first three movies released and then reacquire the Clones film to complete my DVD collection of it.  Now, I suppose I'll buy the Blu-Ray versions, if-and-when they ever come out.The special effects were, of course, top-notch. When you go back and see those early Star Wars films you really see how far Hollywood has advanced in this area. I cannot imagine how many hours of work it took the put these storyboards and computer artwork in this film, there is so much detail. It's mind-boggling.I know a lot of fans of this series feared the writers would mess up the final but their fears were not realized: this was a super ending to a memorable saga that endured for almost 30 years amazing.	5.0	They Really Did Save The Best 'Til Last	2009-04-26	4	3	1

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	"Just before the end of Revenge of the Sith, you realise three things:1. The effects are far superior to Eps. I and II2. The film is better and more enjoyable than Eps. I and II3. You want to immediately watch the original trilogy againAll of these point are extraordinary in that Lucas fulfills the promise of both the Star Wars franchise and computer animation as an enhancement to telling his story.  The filming is deep, textured, and seemless.  When compared to the washed-out backgrounds of Ep. I, you can easily see how far computer-created graphics have come.But what is more extraordinary is that Revenge of the Sith actually is the best movie of this trilogy, and in fact makes all the other episodes more poignant now that we see how Anakin's seduction by the dark side actually takes place.  Fans of Star Wars already know what happens in the film: Anakin turns to the dark side, helps the Emporer destroy the Jedi Knights, and then is defeated by Obi-wan Kenobi in single combat on a lava planet.  Left for dead by Obi-wan, he survives only because of the life support that the famous Darth Vader suit provides.  We also see the birth of Luke and Leia, the offspring that Obi-wan and Yoda hide on Tatooine and Alderaan, respectively, awaiting the time when they can grow up to challenge the power of the Emporer and Vader.Surprisingly, knowing what is going to happen does not make the movie less enjoyable or entertaining.  We see spectacular special effects and the greatest lightsaber battles of the series.  The problems that plagued Ep. II, especially the lack of creativity in the alien worlds and the brutal dialogue, are essentially fixed in Ep. III.  There is some exposition, and there are some cringe-inducing moments between Anakin and Amidala, but they are limited and don't detract from the overall enjoyment of the story.  And there are some spectacular sequences, especially the Obi-wan vs. Grievous battle and the crash-landing of a space cruiser on Coruscant.The performances are far superior to the previous film.  Hayden Christianson embodies the attributes of a rebellious and conflicted young man who allows his personal flaws to take control of his entire being.  Ewan MacGregor, easily the best actor in the film, closes the circle linking this trilogy to the new trilogy - his mannerisms, his smiles, his hairdo, even his dialogue is an echo (or foreshadow) of Alec Guiness.  There is one moment in the battle with Grievous where he smiles a smile that is eerily reminiscent of the smile Guiness uses just before he is killed in Ep. IV.  Even the digital characters have more weight, and seem to obey the laws of physics, something Jar Jar Binks never seemed to do in Ep. I.  The only disappointment is that Amidala is not given anything to do except worry about Anakin, which is a waste of actress Portman's considerable talents.But most importantly for the series as a whole, this film makes the original trilogy better.  In Return of the Jedi, many complained that Luke's turning of Vader back to the good side is ""cheesy,"" put in because Lucas needed a happy ending.  After watching Ep. III, you can believe that Vader's transformation to the dark side did not fully submerge his goodness and that his turning back is a redemption in a way that the original trilogy could never really demonstrate.The DVD has the usual array of extras.  These Star Wars DVD's all contain great extras and some of the best audio commentaries out there.  There are cut scenes and a couple documentaries on the making of the film, all of which are interesting and informative.  For sheer volume, I think there is less on this disc than on previous films in the series, but even so, it is better than most DVD's out there."	5.0	Makes the other 5 movies more poignant and better	2005-11-08	14	10	4
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ABM4K7QY8N4UZ	"C. Ream ""xdelusion"""	"Before I begin, let me say that  Ewan McGregor, Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Jimmy Smits did a wonderful job, and I couldn't have asked for much more from them.Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen just don't seem to be able to act, even Ian McDiarmid was not in character at some VERY important moments at the beginning of the movie!Lets start with the opening scenes. The 1st thing that really troubled me was that the Cutter Driods that were on Ben's ship talked to one another in these cartoon like kiddy voices.I ask you, since when do Starwars droids talk like play things outside of the old 80's droids TV series!??!Second more, what reason does a space droid need for verbal communication when they are IN SPACE? They communicate via remote signaling for crying out loud! There was no need for this Jar Jar esque garbage!The next thing that bothered me (even though the scene was funny) was when R2-D2 had to fight the driods on General Grievous' (oh my name is so dark and...Earthly) ship. That scene was just totaly un-realistic for his type of droid, also the part where Ben tosses the communicater to him and he catches it!?!?The next scene was when they find Palpatine and palpatine looks to be in good health, good humor, and so on.When they find him in the book, he is supposed to look starved, sick, weak, beaten, etc. So when he screams to little orphan Annie, to kill Dukoo, Annie could then think (as he did in the book),""Palpatine is acting VERY strange, but look at him, he must have been through hell"".  NOT IN THIS MOVIE! Nope, in this movie Palpatine is just out right evil straight from the get-go, and no one seems to notice.None of the action scenes really took place as they did in the book, infact it was more like watching a typical hollywood action film as opposed to watching a Kung-Fu movie, or something to that effect which the Jedi are supposed to be molded after, such as in the 70's and 80's films).Palpatine throwing those seating dishes one after another like frisbees? That's just retarded! Also why did Samual Jackson's character have no trouble at all with Palpatine, but Yoda did not? Well it's explained VERY well in the book and has to do with why the Jedi have fallen, but alas, Mr. Lucas failed to include that vital detail.When Anakin finally realizes that Palpatine in infact the Dark Lord, he is supposed to be torn up! He is supposed to absolutly struggle to walk his way back to Sam Jackson, and report to him (while trying to keep his vomit down) that Palpatine is the one.They kid grew up and trusted this guy, it would be like finding your beloved wife of 20 years in bed with your best friend while you were away at work, or worse yet, doing it in front of you so you can see!!!Also Hayden's transistion seemed really abrupt! He was suddenly like,""oh I will serve you my master"" then he tilted his head a bit low and tilted his eye browes a bit, so that he would look evil. Great acting there guy!!!As if that wasn't bad enough, he seems to have no trouble killing children in the next scene, and ironically when the find the children later, it looks as if all limbs were intact and no one made any struggle or attempt to get away...Also why if Padme had no reason to live at the end of the movie, did she take time to name her two children, the only thing she had left in this world that belonged to her, and her lover!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!??Besides, that's now how it went down in the book.I could really go on and on. The book was not one of those books where it would have been in any way impossible to translate to screen 100%. But when you select bad actors just because they appeal with the youth demograph at that time, and when you choose to do the Disney treatment on a story that wasn't too grown up for kids in the 1st place, or when you throw in characters from the old films into the knew, without any real tangible reason for them to be present, just to capitalize off the old fan base or what ever.......well it is pathetic.He should have had David Cronenburg direct the dramatic scenes, he should have taken notes from the book when putting the movie together, and he should have left C3PO, R2, Chewbacca, and other pointless ironies out of this!Give it up Lucas!Long live the Clone Wars cartoons!!!!!!!!!!

This despite having promised myself after seeing the last two episodes that I would never see another Star Wars movie in the theaters unless it was ""The Empire Strikes Back.Nearly three hours later, after the movie rudely and severely diminished my IQ by about 30 points merely by watching it, I left the theaters with the eminently quotable ""Noooooo!"" line which is how previously bad ass Darth Vader reacted to the news of Padme's death.  I guess his vagina hurt him real bad after getting dumped inside a molten volcano by Obi Wan.  Either that or he was so busy being crushed by the weight of his own profound philosophical musings:Peace is a lie, there is only passion.Through passion I gain strength.Through strength I gain power.Through power I gain victory.Through victory my chains are broken.The Force shall set me free.""to notice that he had become a veritable pussy.In closing I would like to say that I hate George Lucas, I hate the jedi and I hate this stupid movie and that I copied and pasted the quoted ""philosophical musings"" from someone else.I would also like to say that if you vote for my review as being helpful to you, you will enjoy the kind of serenity that that little, green, Kermit look-alike jedi dude does and that if you vote for it as being unhelpful I will be forced to quote Darth Vader in his darkest hour."	2.0	A really good movie - if you're retarded.	2005-12-30	15	10	5

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AB74AZNZK69B9	C. Smith	So here we are, at the end of what should have been the greatest trilogy of all time.  It didn't quite happen, did it?  I just watched Revenge of the Sith, a movie I saw twice at the theater and really wanted to like, and I tried to convince myself like everybody else that this one was better than the first two.  Now, I think it was worse.  Not because of special effects or pitiful acting or unreal looking movements of CGI characters or cruddy dialog or any number of other complaints you usually get, but because the story doesn't jive with the old stuff.  It seems George doesn't know his own story.  Remember when Leia said she knew her mother as a young child?  That was a great emotional moment between a brother and sister who never knew each other, and now it makes no sense.  What about Yoda telling Obi Wan that Luke was not their only hope, that there was another Skywalker?  Now Obi Wan is delivering the babies, so he shoulda known, right?  Look, I know the special effects and the acting suck, but dammit at least stick to the story.  Don't undo the magic of the first trilogy with this nonsense.  I'm sure the list of discrepancies is a few miles long, but these are the two at the end of the movie that really made me feel like Lucas has got Alzheimers disease.  Or maybe he's always been that way, because he used to say he always intended on Luke and Leia being siblings, yet he's got 'em smoochin' through the first two movies and she's hanging off his crotch on the first movie poster.  And what's with the technology and spaceships being more advanced in the past than the present?  It's stupid.  Just come on and lets have the old trilogy on dvd the way it used to be and we'll pretend none of the rest of this happened.	2.0	Sith Happens	2005-11-05	20	15	5

George Lucas should never be allowed to write anything ever again. His insipid, cliched dialogue (particularly in Amadala's ""Angry at her 'secret' husband"" scene) was more suited to an episode of G.I. Joe than a multimillion dollar movie. Flat characters abound, even when they're supposed to be going through huge life changes. Anakin turns into Vader with little or no persuasion. Obi-Wan chooses the biggest, noisiest animal to help him sneak into a secret meeting. The ""secret"" lovers ""hide out"" in the princess' quarters, with everyone knowing they're there, amid the huge windows! The movie is so horribly, irredeemably bad that one is praying for it to end at least an hour before it finally wraps up (in a series of endings, involving ""hiding"" the children with the most inobvious people: Anakin's brother on Tattooine and Senator Organa who was their known ally). The only good point was that there was no Jar-Jar except in a silent cameo. If I could give less than one star, I would. Second worst movie.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2RLK9KKVGEETZ	"C. Tsao ""Seaview1"""	"George Lucas has come full circle by completing his Star Wars mega epic with Revenge of the Sith, a marked improvement on the earlier prequels and paving the way to the storylines of the classic trilogy.  Sith is really the episode where most filmgoers could start and not miss too much storyline. Previously, The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, were padded with exposition on the Anakin Skywalker's formative years, and there is no doubt Sith is better than both prequels combined.  While this comeback film isn't quite as good as any of the original trilogy, it is a successful realization of Anakin's descent into the Dark side as Darth Vader.Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), rescue kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from warring Separatists led by Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and General Grievous, a humanoid robot whose features foreshadow Darth Vader.  As Anakin returns home to his now pregnant wife, Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), he has recurring nightmares of her impending death.  Desperate for any means to protect his love, he comes under the influence of the Chancellor who has continued to consolidate his control of the Senate.  Palpatine describes the powers of the Dark side as a means to help Anakin save his wife.  Anakin's ambitions are also frustrated by a denial to join the Jedi Council headed by Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and Yoda (voiced by the winning Frank Oz).  As Obi-Wan pursues Grievous, the Jedi Knights, supported by massive Clone armies, are spread thin in the galaxy.  Anakin searches his emotions even as he suspects an ultimate evil is among them in the form of Darth Sidious.  Alerted by Anakin of possible treachery by Palpatine, Windu and a handful of Jedi Knights come calling in what proves to be a major turning point that severely tests Anakin's loyalties.  Subsequently, the Jedi Knights are vanquished through a series of calculated moves and directives to the Clone troops as Darth Sidious grows stronger and Anakin becomes his deadly enforcer.  This young man who is prophesied to be ""the chosen one who will bring balance to the force"" is instead the one who brings darkness to the Republic (at least until the next generation).  While Obi-Wan and Yoda are among the few to survive, each must face their Dark side counterparts, and the formation of Darth Vader and the future of the Republic in the newly born Luke and Leia foreshadow the next film, A New Hope.The story opens with so much eye candy that the screen becomes one busy video arcade.  Industrial Light and Magic does a smashing job of effects work as always, but the problem is that while the technology is vastly improved, the screen becomes almost too busy.  The dramatic scenes do not complement the action because there is a lack of emotional involvement for the audience. The pacing at times is a bit jarring in jumping from scene to scene.The main theme rests on depicting Anakin's fall to the Dark side.  At times the transformation is unconvincing.  Although Portman and Christensen are talented stars, they lack the experience and directorial support to overcome a simplistic script littered with pedestrian dialogue. Ian McDiarmid comes off best as the subversive Senator Palpatine who may not be who he seems. Ewan McGregor lends a distinguished turn as a mature Obi-Wan with a twinkle of Alec Guinness.  An effective Samuel L. Jackson preferred his character to go out in a blaze of glory, and it is his action scene where the entire movie pivots and the tone of the story takes a decidedly menacing turn.Speaking of acting, one only has to look at the original trilogy to appreciate the chemistry of Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford whose acting skills improved with each film not coincidentally as Lucas began to employ strong directors (Irvin Kershner and Richard Marquand) to compliment his visual production style.The last hour, which is the best, has a Francis Coppola (Lucas' mentor) influence as sequences alternate in operatic grandeur similar to the climaxes in the Godfather films.  These concluding set pieces elevate the film to dramatic heights and recall Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan in which sequences cut back-and-forth between life changing events.  Yoda's battle with Sidious (whose appearance is not unlike the devil of The Exorcist) and Anakin and Obi-Wan's duel with Anakin alternate in epic grandeur. Also, Vader's Frankenstein-like `birth' and Padme's child bearing contrast with almost mythic proportions.The colorful musical score by John Williams links many familiar themes with an updated edge, and the choral background is effective in the climax.  The set designs and costumes are top notch.  Some of the camera shots are striking particularly in an overhead view as Anakin enters the Jedi temple.The film is certainly more intense and violent than any previous Star Wars film and earns its PG13 rating.  It is ironic that Lucas (and Spielberg), who almost single handedly forced the MPAA to create a niche rating with PG13, now returns to that territory.Lucas has propelled his original trilogy into new territory.  By playing on the audience's emotional attachment to the characters and story, the original trilogy takes on a wholly different context. Now and forevermore, lines of dialogue and subtle nuances will take on deeper layers of meaning, and that makes these originals more interesting to watch all over again! Lucas also does a good job of matching and referencing links between Sith and A New Hope right down to the hairstyles, spaceships, and costumes.  Even old favorites like a young Chewbacca make a brief, but memorable appearance.  Through it all in every episode are robots C-3PO and R2-D2 (who acquits himself well).  It would be interesting to see audience reactions watching the series chronologically as intended. Perhaps, Lucas may show the films on television with restored footage as a colossal event like Coppola's Godfather Saga.  How about The Star Wars Saga?Certainly, moviegoers have put Lucas on a higher standard than most filmmakers, perhaps unfairly. Because we want the film to be perfect, it suffers from the lofty standards set by the original films. Without a doubt, Lucas was on the right track with Sith. If only he trusted a strong director of actors and a top screenwriter to improve the dialogue, he would have the makings of a classic to rival The Empire Strikes Back. Was Lawrence Kasdan (who wrote these characters in the original trilogy) too busy to lend a hand?"	4.0	Revenge of the Sith is a Welcome Return to the Dark Side	2005-05-27	5	3	2

Brown	"Once again I was awed by the special effects...George and ILM never fail to impress and excite. For this reviewer, the lightsaber duels were never more powerful or spine tingling as these.  There is one aspect of the movie, however, that I felt left me wanting more...and that was the emotional element of the characters. This may be the woman in me, but Hayden is an exceptional, breathtaking actor who I felt if left to just take the scene and go with it would have made the movie even more.  (for those of you who are skeptical, make sure to see Hayden's performance in Life As a House).  The same is true for Ewan and Natalie.  Just as an emotional scene was coming to life and you were becoming one with the actors, the scene would cut to something else.  Overall I feel that there could have been more intimate ""brotherly love"" connections between Anikan and Obi-Wan to make their goodbye at the end of the movie more devastating.  As for Anikan and Padme, I feel the connections were there, we just didn't get to witness it enough.  Also, my biggest problem with the Padme dying of a broken heart ending was a little weak in that I feel Padme was such a strong woman that she would of done anything to stay alive for Anikan's children.  I feel that the circumstances in the novel, that Anikan in his rage throws her against the side of the ship, was more believable.Overall I feel that this movie was worth waiting for.  It completes the unanswered questions nicely and there was not one scene that I felt was extraneous or uneeded, although maybe too much to try and tell in just one film."	4.0	Epic story in need of more emotional bonding	2005-05-20	6	4	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1HFD1S7QM8RHN	"Damon B. ""Teen Film Critic"""	"It is done. George Lucas' final segment of the Star Wars saga, now nearing its 30th year in existence, is undoubtedly the crowning jewel of the recent trilogy of prequels to the original saga.  In fact, Revenge of the Sith is arguably the finest installment in the overall series since Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back.  While certain minor flaws are present, they're overshadowed by the simple fact that Revenge of the Sith is such an immense welcome breath from the drudgery and rigid problems of the previous prequels (The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones).Perhaps it would be best to first address the issue of the oft-lamented writing and dialogue present in the recent ""Star Wars"" movies.  For the most part, Revenge of the Sith manages to climb out of the deep hole dug by the previous movies: the love scenes between Anakin and Padme are not nearly as lengthy as in Attack of the Clones, Jar Jar Binks literally does not say a word throughout the entire film (although he is present in two scenes), the irritating voices of the droid soldiers have been changed (though they are still a bit grating), and the whiney tone previously present in Anakin's voice is mostly gone.  Sure, the strange dialect of the inhabitants of this distant galaxy is still present as is some stiff, unnatural scripting, but it's time that we acknowledged these traits as ""Star Wars,"" - the original trilogy was equally pretentious with the spoken word.  Rest assured that while the dialogue and writing are still sub-par in many cases, those who cite these flaws as ruining the entire movie are likely nit-picky elitists who are determined to dislike Lucas' work regardless.Despite some flaws, mostly the fault of George Lucas' writing and direction, the overall performances were quite good.  Ian McDiarmid reprises his role as Palpatine and does an excellent job conveying his intense and swift spiral into the dark side.  Concurrently, Ewan McGregor's role as Obi-Wan Kenobi is absolutely spot-on.  Additionally, while Hayden Christensen is simply not an Oscar-worthy actor, his Anakin is worlds more entertaining in Sith than in Attack of the Clones.  As he begins his descent into the dark side, he takes on an almost comical melodramatic approach, and his delivery on some lines is simply flawless.  Cheesy as it may be, shouting ""I hate you,"" at the top of his lungs to Obi-Wan whilst burning to a crisp on the lava planet was simply the highlight of the film.To be fair, however, Revenge of the Sith is not a movie to see for its performances.  What it lacks in this regard, it more than makes up for in terms of special effects, action, and presentation.  The film opens with a sprawling space battle above the skies of the urban planet of Coruscant, and it is simply glorious.  It's not as tense as the more famous of space battles in ""Star Wars,"" history, but it's a pleasing visceral experience and a great way to kick-start the film.  Revenge of the Sith's claim-to-fame, however, are its perfect light saber sequences.  The actors' choreography combined with the stunning computer-generated work make these action sequences work on a level that transcends what was previously thought possible in live-action film.  It's worth the price of admission simply to see the fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin at the film's climax.Hardcore fans of the ""Star Wars"" series will also be pleased to know that Revenge of the Sith is quite successful in bringing back the old ""Star Wars"" flavor not generally apparent in the previous two movies.  The movie proceeds in such a fashion as to allow for multiple storylines, a style vaguely reminiscent of The Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi.  George Lucas is also mercifully discreet with his little quirks this time around: he never slaps you over the head with important ideas and allusions to his previous works prove to be more charming than distracting this time around (fans are still reeling from his grand idea to make young Anakin the creator of C-3PO in Episode I).  The line is almost crossed with the inclusion of Chewbacca in the story, but in the end it's such an insignificant addition that it can be disregarded entirely.In the end, Revenge of the Sith was an entirely pleasant movie-going experience.  It's dark, it's violent, and it is a ton of fun.  For the first time in 22 years, we may actually have a title worthy of the ""Star Wars"" namesake, and at the very least, Revenge of the Sith will wash the bitter taste of The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones right out of your mouth."	4.0	Not perfect, but  certainly a great surprise	2005-08-29	5	4	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ASKUZHOKQ1W3E	"Dane R. Youssef ""surfur"""	"by Dane YoussefIt's all over. The saga is complete. Lucas has come full-circle and so has the universe and it's inhabitants.After ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones,"" Lucas had been accused to selling out on his creation and one of the greatest serial-movies of all time.He had lost the way. Lost his voice. He had become the worst thing an artist can be... a businessman. With all the technology and control in the world... he had become lazy.Unmotivated.Even unimaginative.Being branded just another ""businessman"" is the worst thing that can happen to an artist.At times, the movie feels unnatural and at times, I would call this one of the best thing Lucas has ever done.But this is truly a movie not to be missed.Ever since I was a little boy, when I first saw Darth Vader, I asked myself, ""Is he supposed to be a robot? An alien? Why does he wear that strange suit? It's probably just to make him look scary."" For those who've all wondered the same, Episode III answers that and a lot of others. And you will never look at ""Star Wars"" the same way again.George Lucas seems to be trying to make amends for his later and lesser films, and I for one, think he succeeds wholly here.Lucas totally the gamut totally here and shows the world (just like he did in THX 1138 and American Graffiti) that he is a force to reckoned with, even feared. The force is not merely with him, he is controlling it here.Of course, throughout his whole career and even now, poor Georgie boy has never been able to write so much as a line of realistic dialouge.But I forgive him. Don't we all? When it comes to the creative writing process, there are two schools of thought and different ways to go.those who conjure up great, thrilling worlds (like Mr. Roald Dahl) and those who capture the sparkiling art of conversation (Kevin Smith).The two just don't ordinarily mesh together very well. They just mix like oil and vomit. And Lucas is a dreamer, so we can understand him wanting to do it his way.I don't like to give things away in movies, but really, what's to give away? EVERYONE who has seen ""Star Wars"" and anyone who's seen any of the first three released chapters knows EVERYTHING COMING.We know that Anikan will convert to the dark side and become Darth Vader. We know that the traitor in the midst is Chancellor Palpatine, who will become the Emperor. And that Padme will bore Luke and Leia. Even in Episode IV, Darth Vader tells us how a showdown between him and Obi-Wan turns out.But to see how it all came to be is just plain shocking and even a little disturbing. There is such cruelty and sadness in this chapter. Haven't we all grown up laughing and smiling and looking to ""Star Wars"" for fun and upbeat cheer? ""Star Wars"" has always stood for escapist fantasy.His movies are about visual worlds and dreams, not sparkling, chatty conversation. Lucas pretty much does it all here, so he exposes all his talents and faults clearly. But he is truly a dreamer. Perhaps Lucas wanted to do it all so he could see (and the whole world could as well) just how good he truly is and what good he's at.I truly believe that if Lucas wasn't a filmmaker, Lucas would be that older guy sitting around the campfire telling stories. Old, long forgotten legends of ancient lore and spinning some new ones. Lucas is a dreamer, a homage-payer in his movies.The battles are so amazing, we can forgive everything Lucas has done wrong in his career so far.He creates beautiful galaxies and worlds, especially the planet Mustafar. Another moment comes in a showdown between one of the great Jedi masters and the great Sith masters.Perhaps one of the problems was Lucas has all but done away completely with sets. All of his movies since 1999 are filmed in front of green-screens (or are they called ""green-rooms""? I forget).You can finally see why Lucas has abandoned real sets and muppets and locations in favor on green-screens. Finally, after all this time... you've never seen a movie like this! The first-class FX are all seamless. I know that this is all a movie... all actors, sets and props... but Lucas made me forget.Christensen and Portman feel more natural here than they did in ""Clones."" Probably because their lines here are only half as awkward. And the movie doesn't gloss too much over cheap ""romance"" scenes. Lucas and his team have NEVER excelled there.Well actually, the dynasty between Han and Leia was worth it's weight in gold. Han and Leia. Hell, Luke and Yoda. But Lucas attempts to handle all of the production of this one (and the earlier two) himself.Some artists are talented and blessed enough to be able to just go into a movie and single-handedly make a masterpiece. Some artists do their best as soloists. (Orson Welles, Edward Burns, Woody Allen, Albert Brooks, etc).Others just... need a helping hand.When Padme' tells Anikan she is pregnant from what they've been doing together (see ""Episode II."" Or rather DON'T), Anikan seems like this'll get in the way of his becoming a true Jedi knight.Lucas has problems directing dramatic scenes and even more writing them. As for love scenes, Good Lord, he sure as hell can't write them. But a moment where Padme' expresses her pain at where Anikan is headed and we see his reaction....The ending is so sad, so heartbreaking. We have to remember that this is only Episode III of VI.The average American household (or any other country in the world) has Episodes IV-VI waiting for them at home. After Episode III, IV would be good to wash away this downbeat feeling.""Star Wars"" has always been a hallmark of childhood fantasy, but in this entry, everyone does a lot of growing-up. You'd think all this reality and contemporary sadness would ruin the memory of ""Star Wars.""But no. It doesn't ruin ""Star Wars."" As a matter of fact, it deepens it.This is a movie that needs to be seen by every ""Star Wars"" fan.This is a movie that needs to be seen by every movie fan.This is a movie that needs to be seen by everyone.Why are you even still reading this?

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A169I83JL8QJGN	Daniel A Moir	"I agree with the complaints that people had about Episode II, but Episode III, in my mind, is the very movie fans have been waiting for since Lucas announced the prequels. It is here we see the transformation from Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader. It is here we see the Jedi purge, and it is here that we see a political plot that many are comparing to what is happening in our own government now. The fall of the Republic, and the rise of the Empire. Though I feel this is more similar to events that occurred in history, such as the fall of the Roman republic and the rise of their empire. At any rate, unlike real life this story is clear cut good versus evil, and details a good man's decent into evil.Although I felt that the novel was a better interpretation of the story the movie certainly did a fine job of presenting us with clear and precise logic to Anakin's fall. Palpatine's manipulation of Anakin's feelings, and fears. Much like how the media preys on the fears of the general public, and feeds them exactly what the people need to hear in order to respond the way the media wants them to. Anakin was in a position where he had to go off of what he was told, and never knew any the wiser. On the one hand the moral Right of the film (the Jedi) warning him to steer clear of the Chancellor but in the Jedi tradition they are vague about their reasons. On the other, the Dark lord of the Sith, which convinces Anakin (and everyone else) that the Right is evil, and sets things into motion to obtain permanent power, and orders their extermination. I am a huge Star Wars fan and know a lot about the ideals of both Jedi and Sith, and the core beliefs are Right and Left winged and both exist in terms of light and dark, in a universe painted in shades of gray. The two groups represent a refusal to take the bi-partisan route and find a middle of the road approach that would be for the common good. ROTS demonstrates what is going on in our government to an extent (though again not to the degree that some people have alluded to, Jedi are anything but allegory for liberals) in that the power struggle between Right and Left wages on negating the needs of the people, and those of us who are in the middle.Political forces are demanding that we choose a side, and are painting the other side as being evil regardless of their intentions. The people who reside in Lucas' universe are lucky, however, as the Sith are clearly evil. We have never had a prominent religion outright banned in the USA the way the Jedi were in our lifetime, though forces have moved against various religions in the past. In fact the Jedi purge could be said to (in a way) more so resemble the persecution and purge of the early Mormons in a variety of states back in the 1800s. It's not that big of a stretch. You could also make comparisons of other religious purges, the crusades, the inquisition, etc. There's more to by said by ROTS about the dangers of loosing religion than anything. Being a Sith means you acknowledge yourself as the higher power, the force serves you, where as being a Jedi the force is the higher power and you serve it, much the same way some antagonists of religion see the world. ""Man is the end all tell all, and the world serves us"", vs. religion ""(Insert preferred deity) is the ultimate, and we serve (insert gender preference).""What's beautiful about ROTS, and where it succeeds is that it draws so many parallels like the ones I've illustrated, and in many ways, a lot of the material can be subjective, but even in Star Wars, evil does not see itself that way. They tell themselves ""Peace is a lie, there is only passion. Through passion we gain strength, through strength we gain power, through power we gain victory, through victory our chains are broken."" In that regard the Sith come off as an anti-religious force bent on ridding the universe of a prominent and powerful religion. I think George Lucas had a lot that he wanted to say with this trilogy. For sure, one of those things is that he worries that our republic may crumble. The loss of rights is nothing new, (Government attempts to undo the 2nd amendment as just an example) and the worst part is that just as Palpatine convinced the people it was for their own good the government (not just Bush, but Clinton, H.W. Bush, and going backward) has done the same thing, and if a President does go all the way and bans our right to bare arms they will be met with roaring applause because it makes us ""safe"". In the mean time criminals will still get their guns, and we'll have no way to stop them from hurting us with them... but at least there'll be no way the average citizen could oppose an oppressive government, right? This transition from Republic to dictatorship is a slow one, and I believe Lucas has set out to give us the warning signs of this transition. The point is that this movie accomplishes what the past two installments failed; it showed us what happens when people get misinformed; they then make decisions that they later regret, republics fall and empires rise and good people go bad all because people weren't paying attention to the details, much like most critics will slam this prequel for the same reason. This is a beautiful and wonderful film, it is a phenomenal politically, religiously, and emotionally charged tale with a very clear message. Be mindful of the details, and don't let any government convince you that our constitutional rights are a bad thing."	4.0	Only a Sith wouldn't cry at the end...	2005-05-19	2	2	0

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1SD82ZAT3INZ2	Daniel Hayes	"This was worthy of Oscars besides for special effects and soundtrack you know the customary Oscars that Star Wars movies are thrown when they come out. This was well done all the way from storyline to the cast. Most returned from the ""Attack of the Clones"", and just picked it up from where the last movie left off. I have also noticed that there are little moral nuggets tucked away in these films. The one for here is humility. Not to be humiliated, but to be of a humble spirit. In the scene where Anikan and Obi-Wan were fighting in the volcanic world Obi-Wan reveals to Anikan that he was supposed to be the chosen one to restore the force to it's proper balance. Unfortunately, Anikan couldn't wait to have power, and use that power for the right reasons, so he joins the Dark Side, and uses his powers for evil now instead of good. It seems to me that we as humans have trouble with humility. I am worst of the lot. I can't stand still, and allow the Lord to direct my paths I have to forge it out myself, and believe it's the Lord's will. I feel that Anikan's downfall was the fact that he couldn't wait. It was shown in ""Attack Of The Clones"" that Anikan couldn't wait, and he couldn't control no matter how Obi-Wan tried to tell him to control his feelings, and tried to make him only think of his duty. That's all well and good, but you can't be blind to your passions realize you have them, and be honest about them, so you can learn to control them, and I feel that's where Obi-Wan failed Anikan. I can't help but wonder what it would've been had Obi-Wan tried to be more of a father to Anikan instead of a master. To me a father if he really tried to be a father would be more understanding of Anikan's passions, and the fact that he's a young man trying to show the world what he has to offer. After all they're both human, and Obi-Wan was young at one time when Kwi-Gon Jinn was master, so Obi-Wan should've tried to understand Anikan as he was a human being that had passions, and feelings that were all a part of being human, so instead of teaching Anikan about the Birds and the Bees Anikan is left to his own devices, and he woos Padme into marriage, and finally pregnancy where this begins the next generation of Star Wars. I know that I make sure I do all this with my son to where he's prepared for life when he gets older. Well anyway, this is still a terrific film, and should be recognized as one of the best."	5.0	This is how I like it.	2008-09-04	1	0	1

He was beyond wooden.. he was like lead. It was literally painful to watch. All the fight-scenes in the world couldn't make up for it.By the end of this movie, I wanted to spit on Hayden's face. He is the worst excuse for an actor I've ever seen in my life. I literally hate him.Things I do like: Mace Windu basically defeated Palpatine. Anakin (yes, it's spelled with an ""a"" for ****'s sake...) kills Mace, but Windu basically proved himself to be Palpatine's better.I read the book after I watched the movie.. and it's really great. I mean, seriously, it's awesome. It conveys things in a way this movie couldn't hope to, what with Hayden's acting, and the shoddy script.I mean come ON, ""you're so beautiful?"" What the hell is that?The fight scene at the end was excellent (though they didn't actually sweat any..), and it was a powerful moment when Ewan shouted ""YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE!""Hayden even had his moment when he screamed back ""I HATE YOU!"" the embodiment of pure evil having almost totally consumed him, it is truly a frightening sight to behold.Palpatine's deception at the end becomes complete, and totally evident, when he tells Vader that he killed Padme.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2P49WD75WHAG5	Daniel J. Hamlow	A space battle opens the conclusion of the Star Wars prequel, Revenge of the Sith, full of large-sized battle cruisers and the mad flurry of fighters buzzing around like angry insects in space.  Two of those fighters are piloted by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker.  They are trying to rescue Chancellor Palpatine, who has been kidnapped by the giant skeletal android general and separatist General Grievous, also collaborating with Count Dooku.  This is the final and crucial stage of the civil war that has torn the Old Republic apart.Anakin is praised as a hero with his rescue of Palpatine, but his mind is clouded with fear on several fronts.  One, he has a nightmare where Padme, now pregnant, dies during childbirth.  His love of her is strong enough that he is fearful of losing her the same way he did his mother.  Two, he gets caught up in politics between Palpatine, who increasingly becomes his mentor, and the Jedi Council, who are concerned that the Chancellor has already served more than term limits allow and want him to step down.  He is resentful when the council refuses to make him a Jedi Master.  This is due his links with Palpatine.  The wily Chancellor subtly sets about turning Anakin to the dark side.High points include the battle scenes on Grievous's planet, and other action scenes, such as Grievous battling Obi-Wan with four lightsabres in each of his hands, but as someone raised on the original trilogy, it's the overall occurrence of events that makes Episode III fit in a previously unfinished six-part jigsaw puzzle that got me excited.  And yes, there is a sense of satisfaction in seeing the familiar black armour, skeletal mask, breathing machine, and ominous voice debut in the new trilogy.  After all, Darth Vader was my favourite character during my younger years, along with Boba Fett.  Nearly as mind-blowing is the transformation of Palpatine to the evil wizened dictator,A lot of political relevance can be seen in the new trilogy, which while telling the story of how Anakin became Darth Vader, also tells of the rise to power of Senator, later Chancellor and finally Emperor Palpatine, which has parallels to the rise of Hitler to power.  In fact his rise to power and his Order 66 he gives the Clonetroopers has parallels to the Enabling Act and the Night of the Long Knives (1934).  However, his declaration of himself as Emperor and the leads Amidala to whisper to fellow Senator Bail Organa (the future guardian of her daughter Leia) on how democracy is destroyed under a thunder of applause, bringing to mind how our own democracy was sundered under the PATRIOT Act, by consent of the lawmakers.An interesting differences between the Jedi and the Sith:  when Anakin tells Yoda of his nightmare, Yoda tells him that death is a part of life and he should be celebrate the dying become part of the force, that clinging onto the material part (the ego) brings suffering, whereas Palpatine relates to Anakin the power the individualistic Sith have to save people from death.  The Jedi thus embody a Buddhist outlook of life, whereas the Sith seem to be analogous to Anton LaVey's Church of Satan, though Palpatine uses his power for evil.As expected and promised, this is the most tragic of the series, but given most people's knowledge of Star Wars, this is hardly surprising.  Other stuff:  other than Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, and Ian McDiarmid reprising their roles from the original trilogy, Jeremy Bulloch, who played Boba Fett, plays Captain Colton in Sith.As far as I can see, the loose ends are tied up, setting up the characters of Ben Kenobi, C3PO, R2-D2, and Owen and Beru Lars for the 1977 movie, and that of Yoda for Empire.After the disasters of Episode I, the Video Menace, and Episode II-Dude, Where's My Clone?, George Lucas redeems himself with Episode III-Revenge of the Sith.	5.0	May the Dark Side Be With You!	2005-06-29	12	5	7

George Lucas destroyed the franchise with this travesty you call a film. The only redeeming features of this movie are Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan and the Emperor. Order 66 I will call neutral, because although it was an excellent scene in an otherwise dismal movie, you just know there are plenty of garage bands out there who are now named ""Order 66"". God there is so much wrong in this movie I dont even know where to begin. It does not carry on the spirit that Episodes IV, V, and to a lesser extent VI began. To the previous reviewer who stated that A New Hope started out being called Star Wars is wrong, it was titled A New Hope from the beginning. In fact, many people were confused by the fact that Episode IV popped up on the screen while they were under the impression they were seeing it for the first time. The love story is terrible, especially compared to the Han-Leiah love story from Episode 5. That is one of the greatest love stories of all time simply because it is not overt, its under the surface the entire time, until the fateful moment when Leiah declares her love for Han. Of course this love story between Anakin and Padme is sappy, cliche, and stupid. Plus, what made Vader cool was the fact that he was tempted by the dark side, it was his fate, it was inevitable that he bring balance to the force (incedentally, yes he did. at the end of it all there were two sith and two jedi. Balance.) by turning evil. But no, he did it out of 'love'. LUCAS TURNED VADER INTO A [WIMP]."	2.0	This movie was terrible!	2005-12-28	7	3	4

Watching Anakin fall from the height of his glory to the depths of hate and the bondage that Emperor Palpatine put him in was extraordinary to watch. Lucas did a wonderful job with this one.Yes, Ok, there where some really lame scenes, and too much force powers going on. Did Obi Wan really need  to force jump out of everything? But other than that Lucas stayed true to the original series, matching everything perfectly, keeping true what makes star wars and all its characters what it is.Don't watch this expecting to be unmoved, the feelings portrayed here are to great to not be at least touched by what is happening. But the greatest part of this movie is when we see Darth Vader being created for the very first time. The mask being slowly lowered, and then......the breathing starts.Hayden Christianson is absolutely wonderful as the young Darth Vader, especially when he battles Obi Wan on the lava moon. Such depths of feelings are portrayed in his eyes, and when he cries.....it makes you remember why you love Darth Vader all over again.	5.0	Only the sith deal in absolutes	2005-05-23	3	1	2

We've seen his descent from Ep. 1, but we finally got to see what pushed him over the edge. This episode was darker even than Empire (Ep. 5 for those counting), especially with the PG-13 rating. I was worried by the fact that I was to be in Iraq when this movie hit theatres, and that I woulda missed the full-on THX experience, but, Woo-Hoo!!!! I made it home on leave just in time to see this awesome last installment on opening weekend and it was definitely worth a PG-13 rating and the 3-year wait! The drama is done very well, not childish like the love scenes in Ep II; and the fight scenes are numerous and very dramatic themselves, especially the final duel between Obi-wan and Anakin/Vader; and the graphics are amazing, especially considering the entire movie (except for the Luke handoff at the end) was done entirely in the studio, mostly in front of a green-screen. It was still playing at the theatre on my base in Iraq when I returned and I saw it as many times as possible there (especially since it was free!).P.S. If you didn't like Ep I, and you didn't like Ep II, what makes you think that you'd like this episode? Stop writing reviews bashing George Lucas just because you don't feel that he wrote the story the way you thought it was going to be back when the original trilogy came out.

"Despite all the ridiculous complaining by many Star Wars fans about the previous two Star Wars films being inadequate - Revenge Of The Sith is, by far, the weakest of the current trilogy series. Sure it has magnificent special effects and plenty of shocking scenes. But its all about the story, stupid! Unlike the previous two Star Wars films, which were masterpieces, this finale left me feeling flat as a pancake, disappointed and very annoyed. Maybe the actors were exhausted by an oppressive director. Or, perhaps George Lucas is getting burned out, like his scenes in the volcano. Whatever the reason, Revenge of the Sith certainly didn't capture my imagination like previous Star Wars films did!I also found it quite annoying that George Lucas would force me to suspend every iota of disbelief by watching a rather lengthy hand-to-hand combat scene take place inches above roiling volcano lava! When its all over, one character practically explodes, while the other has only one tiny burn mark on his clothes! It borders on camp, something George Lucas should be truly ashamed of!Nor did I find it the least bit believable to see Anikin become so totally clueless, utterly naive and a cold blooded killer of children all at the same time. Its just not realistic to turn him into such a utter moron!George, you blew it! Next time you make a movie don't focus group the movie to death.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A239PPUVV8O0U0	D. A. Reed	Well Anakin finally becomes Darth Vader and Hayden Christensen actually CAN act. Though some of his deliveries feel flat and the romantic dialog is still iffy, it still doesn't stop this from ranking high (but not topping) the original three. The first hour is setup for the final act but what a setup! The Battle of Coruscant is one of the best space fights since the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi, even the most avid movie goer able to tell what's real and what's computer would probably have a hard time distinguishing, even when you know its computer generated. The fight with Count Dooku is well choreographed and Christensen unfortunately kills Christopher Lee (should've killed him in the last movie, he had the upper hand). Then for about thirty minutes, it feels like the previous installments. Though I don't think Lucas should've cut out ALL of the scenes featuring the birth of the Rebel Alliance, as that would've been an interesting sub-plot and he would've given Natalie Portman more to do than just cry and pine after Christensen. But after that there's; the Battle of Kashyyyk (with a cameo by Chewbacca), Mace Windu fighting the Emperor (and the death of my favorite Jedi, Kit Fisto) and then its Anakin going to the dark side. Out of the six, this is the darkest and, like Empire, the most story driven. Ian McDiarmid is perfect as the Emperor, who clearly is one of, if not the, greastest cinema villain ever. And why is that? He masterminds an entire war and then reforms the current government into the Empire (why does that sound presently familiar? A man who's great at giving speeches, sweeps the Senate into an uproar of promised change and peace and turns it into a dictatorship? Eh, must be my imaginatation. Yeah. Right). Anyway, Ewan McGregor gives an admirable performance, clearly devastated at the thought of Anakin going to the dark side and then having to face him. Of course, the fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan and the fight between Palpatine and Yoda is the best lightsaber sequence out of the six. And of course, the birth of Darth Vader also gives birth to Luke and Leia. And John Williams delivers his best score for the saga, the music that backdrops Anakin and Obi-Wan/Palpatine and Yoda's lightsaber duels.	5.0	Easily The Best of the Newer Three	2009-11-05	5	4	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ABRA9PU5NJMFL	"DaRev1 ""DaRev1"""	Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie''s plot.This movie is the must see event of the past 10 years, possibly more in my opinion. It was amazing. Star Wars fans will love it, regardless of some terrible writing on George Lucas' part, he needs to hire a different writer who has a bit more talent than him.POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADThe effects and the storyline were great. It was very touching, being a HUGE Anakin Skywalker fan myself, I loved it. The light saber dual between Anakin and Obi Wan was awesome, very intense and very upsetting at the same time, to see such good friends go against each other, but this only added to the film.I must agree that Anakin gave in to the dark side rather quickly. It were as if all the Chancellor had to do was snap his fingers and Anakin was his. No resistance what-so-ever.Another thing that dazzled me was how quickly Padme's stomach grew with her pregnancy, it seemed as if every day her stomach got increasingly larger. Then at the end of the movie, it is revealed that she is carrying twins, and for some one carrying TWO babies, that was the smallest pregnant belly I have EVER seen. Then, Luke and Leia (forgive my spelling if that's incorrect) come into the world, and Padme dies immediately following, which makes one question how Leia later states to Luke that she remembers something of her mother.But other than the bad script and a few minor plot flaws, this movie was great and I really loved it and I'm sure all who see it will love it too.	5.0	Best Star War Movie To Date!	2005-05-26	4	2	2

George did an exelent job with this final instalment. I liked how John Williams music gives emotion to the movie and how at the first half of the movie, you can hear sudden dull echoes of sound like if the climax was coming. It was pretty sad how all the jedi died, i almost cried. I loved those duels, specially palpatine against mace windu and yoda... At the end a tear almost came out of my eyes with that music and luke and everything.By the way one of the DELETED SCENES of this movie is when grievus stabs poor Ki-Adi-Mundi in front of obi wan and anakin on the cruiser and when yoda arrives in a small transport at dagobah, thi was the only thing i thought George shouldnt have deleted.If you havent seen it, buy it and watch it, if you have already seen it, then buy it and watch it again.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2HII4U9WQ0XUV	"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep"""	"I've figured it out: ""New Star Wars"" is like the ""New Coke"" that came out a decade ago. It has the same packaging, same styling, pretty much the same contents.But that said, something's wrong with the new formula---brutally wrong. It's just---off. It's too saccharine, too sweet. It may be that George Lucas, who launched his band of space-faring Merry Pranksters nearly 30 years ago, is so radically different a man, and a moviemaker, that he doesn't have the same angle on his material. Or it could very well be that Lucas got very, *very* lucky back with the original Stars Wars, knocked it out of the ballpark, and wisely ceded control of his brainchild to the hands of far more capable directors (as with Empire and Return).Because, let's face it: if Lucas made ""Star Wars"" today, it would be a one-shot affair. There would be no sequels, prequels, or whatever, and Lucas would be looking at a very long career as a special effects flunkey, or second-unit director. At best.Some have lavished praise on ""Revenge of the Sith"" because it isn't the embarrassingly monstrous turd Lucas laid in the first two 'prequels'---and that's truth: for all its lumbering cloddishness, ""Revenge"" looks like Citizen Kane compared to the first two installments.But for all the sound and fury, ""Sith"" is still a turd.With that in mind, what follows is a Blaster-style review, not an elegant weapon intended for a more noble age, but quick and meant for the kill.What worked:1)Light Sabre Duels & Stuff Blowing Up: Props to Lucas---finally he gives the fans what we really want. True, the Emperor-Yoda duel was silly, with Yoda pinballing it around the Senate chamber like some manic green Altoid. But when Sith worked, it worked because of the intense, gloriously choreagraphed saber duels, all bitter, violent, and nasty (Dooku v. Anakin, Anakin v. Grievous, Anakin v. Obi Wan).The big Capital Ship battles at the beginning were also dandy, but we were thrown into them without much context---as a result, they came off as pretty much what I see every day on my X-Box. And I can *fly* the battles myself on my X-Box.2) Hayden Christensen: biggest surprise of the flick---he may have taken flack before for his leaden performances, but the boy can act. ""Sith"" is Hayden's movie, and with a lot of Lucas's dead CGI-weight to bear, he carries it---and owns the flick completely. I never thought I would say this, but here goes: his Darth Vader is actually far more sinister, and terrifying, *before* the gimp suit goes on.3) The Acting! Another surprise---the actors here finally regrouped, drew a line in the sand, said ""damn the blue screens!"" and held their own nicely. Ewan McGregor (Ben), Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine), and Christopher Lee (Dooku) can act in their sleep---and do---but even the weaker characters, like Portman's Padme, Samuel Jackson's Mace Windu, and even fashion-victim Jimmy Smits as Bail Organa---hold their own.4) General Grievous: voiced by sound-guy Matt Wood, Grievous stole the show from former heavyweights like Dooku and hometown faves like the armored up Darth---not bad for a tubercular droid separatist with a Mantid walk and a voice like cookie-monster.The BAD & the UGLY: Pretty much everything else is a monstrous Lucas space-floater. The pacing: pitiful. Lucas hasn't a clue how to pace a movie and milk the dramatic tension; the result is a flick that feels like a bunch of cutscenes from better movies. Everything happens mainly offscreen: the betrayal and destruction of the Jedi, which I could have enjoyed seeing much more of, are almost throaway sequences.The CGI: occasionally awful, and always invasive---Lucas can't resist throwing in cutesy little bots, or flying insects, every time he senses the movie getting quiet. Take the climactic lava-planet fight: at the height of the duel, a little mining probe-bot drops down, burbling and beeping, obliterating the ambience.The Dark Side: I don't buy Anakin's flip-flop from goody-two shoes hero to child-killing war criminal playing light sabre whack-a-mole with the Jedi younglings. His reason? He's afraid Padme will die in childbirth. Umm---and for this you're willing to wreck an entire galaxy? Anakin, I've got a solution, one word: Abortion.Darth: the moment we've all been waiting for---the Crowning of the Dark Knight---edges dangerously close to self-parody, with Darth frog-stepping it off the operating table in true Frankenstein fashion. The Emperor needed only to cackle ""It's aliiiiiive! My creation is ALIVE!"" with lightning crackling around the operating table to complete the scene.And then, just when you think it couldn't get much worse---our newly minted Darth crooks his helmeted head up to the heavens and bellows ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"".I feel your pain, Darth. No, *really*.Worse still, the Darth we get is pretty much in name only: we're treated to nothing more than a jumble of silent vignettes, with Darth chumming around with his new Gestapo buddies and oohing and ahhhing over everybody's shiny new toy, the Death Star.Where is the imminently quotable Darth of the good old trilogy, the Darth who turned out choice one-liners like ""this shall be a Day long remembered"" and ""Apology accepted, Captain Needa"".The answer: that Darth is long dead, like the original Star Wars, like Lucas's once fresh and powerful vision, burned, scarred, and entombed beneath the glossy shiny armor of George Lucas's fixation with digital imagery.Empire Strikes back? Try Empire Strikes Out. This final installment, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing, goes out not with a bang but with a whimper. At least Jar-Jar had the decency to keep quiet during the funeral.JSG"	1.0	Tough Sith	2005-11-03	50	28	22

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1IERRUEEJ35H5	DarkStar	Do not let the prequel-haters fool you. Revenge Of The Sith is by far the best of the 6 films. For people who have actually lived through a military coup, the one depicted in this movie is so accurate in the inner workings, that it will induce a chilling discomfort as you watch the series of dramatic events unfold.As a sword fight junkie, the choreography in this movie is so delightful that it earned the right to be included of my bloody samurai DVD collection (Lone Wolf and Cub, The Sword of Doom ;).

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2ALCP39U486CI	Darrin Matteson	"Many critics pan the first 2 Star Wars prequels commenting on how weak the scripts or story-telling were, how bogged down the plots were by the galactic politics and etc.  But I think to fully appreciate the prequel trilogy one needs to change his/her perspective.Watching Episodes I-III as the story about Anakin turned to the dark side-- the first 2 films are bound to disappoint.  Watching the prequel films from the perspective that these are films not about Anakin's shift to the dark side, but from the point of view of the delightfully Machiavellian Palpatine, then a greater appreciation can be gained.From Episode I we saw the strings being pulled as Palpatine played both sides against each other in such a way that regardless of the outcome, he'd get the results he wanted.Episode II saw an extrapolation of his pure Machiavellian deviousness (was George Lucas inspired by ""The Prince"" when he dreamed up the Palpatine character?)  The clone army had been created to serve the Republic... or had it been created to serve the dark side?  Count Dooku's revelation that the Republic was being controlled by a Sith Lord mirrored Darth Vader's revelation in ""The Empire Strike's Back"" that Darth Vader and Anakin Skywalker were one in the same.  Also the scene with the Trade Federation discussing the weapon they are working on, and then seeing the plans for what, in Episode IV, would become the Death Star!Episode III is the bookend, it's both a finale (for Palpatine's story, his plan is complete) and a new beginning (the birth of Luke & Leia).  It ties up the loose ends and (as other reviewers) have stated adds a poignancy to the friendship/mentorship that existed between Obi Wan and Anakin/Vader.  The scene where Obi Wan sees that Anakin has killed ""the younglings"" (okay, that term is utterly ridiculous-- they're ""children""-- none of this ""younglings"" crap!).  Ewan MacGregor's portrayal of Obi Wan at this point is spot on.  You can both feel and see the hurt in his eyes-- reminiscent of that of a father of a prodigal son.  Hayden Christensen's performance in Episode III, if anything helps vindicate and validate his performance in Episode II.  While he may have been ""wooden"" in Episode II it's because he was trying to do what was right but he had that fear and anger inside of him that kept clouding his judgement.  The wooden performance was of a man torn between the dark and light, straddling a line.  In Episode III, we see that line snap along with Anakin!  Christensen's performance in Episode III was probably his best since ""Life as a House"" with Kevin Kline a few years ago.All in all, a joy to watch!  George Lucas's return to the use of miniatures rather than relying so heavily on CGI (as he did in the first 2 prequels) was also a very welcome shift from Episodes I & II.  While not the best of the Star Wars films it's certainly close!"	5.0	Excellent conclusion to an underrated trilogy	2005-11-01	1	0	1

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1POG11EAC2KLH	"Darth Cheese ""Darth Cheese"""	For many years we have been expecting this movie to be the best of all the Star Wars movies, for many times we have sat in a room with a lot of friends discussing the possible way that George Lucas would approach the absolute destiny of the Skywalker family. And yes, many of our predictions became true,many of our expectations where fulfilled but many also weren't.An important issue came upon me when a friend asked me what the objective of George Lucas had been when Darth Sidious explained Anakin that the miniclorians could be controlled even to the point of giving life, therefore, we understood that Anakin was in fact created by the Sith to bring forth the erradication of the Jedi, because in Episode I we were meant to know that he didn't have a father that he was created by the miniclorians like a modern Jesus Christ. By this, I can conclude that I'm a huge fan of Star Wars but George Lucas had some really crutial errors in his writing, especially, establishing the link between the old saga and the new saga, Did anybody notice that C-3PO lived for some time with The Lars and that actually Owen Lars didn't recognize his name in Episode IV? for me that is the only terrifying error that perils the stability of the whole saga.In my opinion Episode III is the second best of the Star Wars Saga, because it lacks more chaos that we were supposed to be believe, in any attempt to overcome an established government there is military action on the streets, people are pushed to their homes, no commerce is permitted, in other words, all hell is broken loose. But in Episode III, we see in the background of Corusant traffic like nothing is happening in the republic, the only chaos we see is the attack upon the jedi temple.thank you for your time.	5.0	Is Anakin really a creation from Darth Plagius the wise???	2005-08-04	13	6	7

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3GKOMCQTTWPUI	"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL"""	"What excitement! I structured my day around this screening of Star Wars. I even made sure to arrive over an hour early to find parking, to eat so I wouldn't get hungry, and use the bathroom, so I wouldn't have to slip out. And it wasn't just me, we all sat in our seats waiting with great anticipation. Then the words ""Star Wars"" (in that all so familiar font) began floating out in endless space. This audience shouted and clapped with the nostalgia. ""Star Wars"" is certainly an event.The film opens with zest, zeal, a screen full of action, space ships in flight, large, small, bursting in flames, firing round after round. Anakin and Obi-Wan banter via intercoms in their small crafts racing to save the Chancellor. It's a shimmering spectacle of special effects and choreography splendidly set into light.The action is backed with substance. The spiritual battle for Anakin's heart and mind wages. Though many viewers and reviewers did not enjoy this Anakin from Episode II, I did and still do. Christensen is a good actor filling very difficult shoes. Who he is to become is legendary, mythical, nearly godlike to those lovers of the series. That is a tall order and Christensen matches the challenge. Additionally, the dialogue this time around is somehow meatier, much more laden with philosophical choice. ""Fearing loss is the lure of the darkside,"" I paraphrase Yoda. In fact, the troubles that lay on the head of this Anakin are not unlike choices made by all humans. Can I trust my Elders? Can I trust my government? Where does my duty to my family end and duty to myself start? And what about my duty to humanity? These are all great questions with which Anakin struggles in an ever-deepening intensity up until that tragic pivotal moment when he finally chooses ... not just the emotional climax of Episode III, but in fact, the climax of the trilogy. Up until that moment, Episode III is a masterpiece, far outdoing the other two, in form, direction, and drive. But that moment is not only tragic for Anakin, it is tragic to Episode III. The choice is made unconvincingly, weak emotionally, un-involving and absent of a connected upward pointed arch that should have preceded it. Episode III, is a Bolero that climaxes ineptly.Having been so captivated, so thoroughly engaged by this film, that poorly handled moment wounded my ability to enjoy what was to follow. Perhaps five or ten minutes transpired before I was able to coax myself back into appreciating what was truly going well in the film. And so I did. But then an important battle with Yoda ends vaguely, followed by a cliche and impotent Frankenstein-like first stand of Darth Vader. This moment is plainly embarrassing. Two very important emotional moments to the series are not only not brought to full flaming glory, but are actually below the quality of the rest of the production.Despite these deep scars, the film is visually gorgeous, a work of art, never dull, and about the biggest thing to happen on screen this year.Two other points:1) Gravity is greatly reduced in space ... things shouldn't slide off space ships and ""fall.""2) Phenomenal creature art design (all the design is high high quality). I especially appreciated the look and functionality of General Grievous - absolutely top notch."	4.0	I had high expectations...	2005-11-21	6	4	2

Don't get me wrong, the special effects were great, but the story and dialogue was lacking.  After seeing Episode One, I wanted to kill myself, because of a certain character who would not shut the Hell up.  You know who I'm talking about, Jar Jar Binks.  When he had much smaller speaking scenes I was a little relieved, but when he did not speak at all, Oh Eureka!  But all Jar Jar aside, there is a huge gap that needs to be filled between Episode 3 and the movie that started all of this Star Wars craze.

George	"""Star Wars, Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith"" actually is a 4 1/2 star movie, but since Amazon has only full-star ratings, I'll go with the 4 stars. This is the ""Star Wars"" film the hardcore fans have waited for. In my opinion, it is second best of the six, behind ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The last hour and a half of ""Sith"" is, in fact, the best of the entire saga. It suffers a bit again with the clunky dialogue between Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker) and Natalie Portman (Padme Amidala-Skywalker), but once we get past that, the film is absolutely awesome. Once the true identity of Darth Sidious is revealed (I won't give it away for anyone who hasn't seen it), ""Sith"" becomes a dark, grim tale-exactly what this final episode needed. The PG-13 rating is justified; the sequence involving Anakin on the lava bank is grisly, and kudos to director George Lucas for maintaining his vision and leaving the scene in the final cut. I have seen this film four times to date; I can't wait for the DVD, which will be available in November or December.

Either people are hailing it as a great return to the franchise, a better movie then I&II; but still crap, or I enjoyed this movie because i like summer blockbusters.Let me say that I am a complete Star Wars fanboy. But instead of being the guy that was 9 in 1977 I was the guy that was 9 in 1997. I grew up with the originals on VHS and on the WB on Saturday mornings. I read anything I saw with Star Wars on it. And then I went to see all the special editions. So heres my review...I saw ROTS opening night, midnight. I loved it. Opening the movie up with a gigantic battle really saved the movie because right after we get more crappy Padme-Anakin dialogue. Hayden is way better this time around but Portman...ugh I saw you in Garden State...you can freaking emote!But this movie has far less shortcoming if judged alone then Return of the Jedi. Jedi's first hour was amazing but then it slowed down to a crawl with stupid Ewoks and ""Lets blow the Death Star up...again."" Not even that the most fearsome villian is turned into a mere puppet to a old wrinkly guy in a chair. The Palpatine of Ep III is way cooler then Ep VI because hes so smart and manipulative. With Anakin he never shows what he truly has in store but he just lays out everything on the table for Luke. ""Angry now? How about I do this? No? How about I kill your friends? Wanna strike me down with your saber yet? Oh ok, maybe you will later.""Not to mention the terribly played out sister thing.So in conclusion Episode Three while containing things like ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" and ""Your beautiful!""""Only because im so in love with you"" still beats out Jedi in my opinion.My best example is how each movie approches their final duel seqeunces.Jedi: Luke and Emporer talking-Ewok attack-Oh no Shields still up!-Luke vs Vader-More ewoks dying-Exploding ships-Cool lightsabers-Crappy teddy bears-More exploding ships. etc etcSith: Back in forth from Anakin vs Obi-wan to Yoda vs Palpatine...the coolest duels ever."	4.0	Revenge of the Franchise	2005-06-04	5	3	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1FL9JCI32TC0Y	"D. Colley ""daz78"""	...sort of.The best of the prequels, without a doubt. The film is darker in tone, both visually, and of course, in the storytelling.However, the overkill of cartoonish special effects (the primary space battle for example, with 'flying robots' or the long awaited dual on a lava planet) still turns the whole disappointing affair into a sort of giant advertisement for the next-generation of Star Wars fans (i.e. kids). Sigh...But, strangely, you come away from this experience  knowing that you have seen a good film. Its faults could fill a million buckets, but the overall film lets off an emotional energy that was very much lacking in the first two prequel films. We have empathy and sympathy for the main characters (even Anakin, as we know his tragic destiny before he does).In this film, Yoda evolves from being a stiff fortune cookie orator into a vulnerable, lovable creature we know from The Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi. However, Palpatine steals the show, as Ian McDiarmid shows of the darkside of his acting force (sorry). Hayden Christensen is a lot more comfortable in the role that the Attack of the Clones movie, though his romantic pulpish dialogue with Natalie Portman still remains toe-curling as ever. Ewan McGregor, again, plays Alec Guinness's character Obi Wan with enthusiasm and relish.General Grevious, however, serves no purpose whatsoever. His party act of four sabres, replacing the more insidious two-sabred gecko faced ghoul, Darth Maul. Grevious seems a novelty bag guy - filling a void ready to be filled by Darth Vader. Grevious's coughing is slightly embarrassing, and his boom-box voice remains only on a panto stage.It would have been more satisfying if the The Phantom Menace and the Attack of the Clones movies were just one movie (take out all the pretend-grown up nonsense about `tax' in The Phantom Menace, and, the bloated unwanted action sequences in Attack of the Clones) and have Darth Vader's role brought in much earlier (in the mask, he is in this movie barely one minute and his dialogue is just a couple of lines).John Williams's new scores for the franchise seem more fresher and diverse than Attack of the Clones.Conceptual design is amazing and imaginative as ever, with subtle hints of the evolution of the machines, armour and space craft that appear in the old Star Wars movies. The clone troopers in this movie are an evolutionary bridge between the original clone troops and stormtroopers.The special effects, though darker, still seem cartoonish at times. The lava duel, though it's quite emotional in its importance, seems slightly unreal and ludicrous (something you would see on a Saturday morning cartoon). Overkill seems the order of the day - with Lucas's notion that the bigger and faster will deter/answer his critics. Pace is needed more in this film. Not EVERYTHING has to be explained, the audience are not ALL children.Darth Vader's small role is also slightly toe-curling. His Frankenstein stomp made my cheeks burn with embarrassment. At least it couldn't get any worse - but then he went `Nooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!' and I squirmed for the poor guy. His standing next to the newly crowned Emperor, overseeing the construction of the Death Star kind of semi-redeems this however. Just one thing puzzles me; in this scene, a young Tarkin walks away and leaves the two dark ones to gaze admirably at their new toy. Tarkin seems unimportant and not worthy of their presence. But, in Star Wars: A New Hope, Tarkin seems to be Darth Vader's boss (Vader's follows his orders obediently). Maybe it is just me...Side-tracking again!All in all, this is a good film. It could have been a lot better, but with the hype that snow-balled the new saga for nearly ten years (since the prequels were announced) Lucas never really stood a chance.  Though this defense is weak against the first two prequels.Younger kids may find some of the scenes too dark (though suggestive and unseen, Anakin slaughters children, and there are many amputation shots).	4.0	Redemption...	2005-12-14	5	4	1

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A23GFTVIETX7DS	Debbie Lee Wesselmann	"Finally, after two films blatantly dedicated to special effects and marketing, George Lucas has re-discovered story in his Star Wars epic.  ""The Revenge of the Sith"" returns to the battle between good and evil, this time in the person of Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) who will tip the balance of the universe to the dark side.  The film begins with Obi-wan and Anakin's daring rescue of the kidnapped Chancellor and showdown with Count Dooku, an event that shapes Anakin's destiny.  Back home, Anakin is plagued by dreams of his beloved Padme (Natalie Portman) dying in childbirth, and he is driven by his fear of loss and growing sense of his own power.  As the Senate moves away from democracy and loyal Anakin is offended by criticism of these legal acts, the stage is set for the good-hearted but immature Jedi to be recruited by the one who most covets his power, the eventual Emperor, now Chancellor of the Senate.Hayden Christensen is surprisingly convincing and even compelling in his transformation from young Jedi to Sith Lord.  The burning desperation in his eyes becomes intense anger and evil in ways I never expected from an actor who is much less believable in expressing love.  (His chemistry with Natalie Portman is much better in this one than in the last.)  Ewan McGregor performs his Obi-wan persona with confidence, making it wholly believable that he will become the wise, calm mentor of Luke Skywalker. Obi-wan's affection for Anakin lends a poignant context to the original trilogy.  Natalie Portman is given much less to do in this episode; her presence is more expected than noteworthy, although her realization of what her husband has become is one of the most powerful in the film.The fight scenes are tightly edited.  The special effects are mostly first-rate and necessary (save for a show-off pursuit on a lizard), and best of all, Jar Jar barely makes an appearance.  Gone are all the esoteric political alliances and laws that clouded the last two.  Lucas simply tells his story, and as all fans of the original know, it is a good one.  The only thing missing from this episode is the endearing camaraderie and humor of the original ""Star Wars.""""Revenge of the Sith"" is surprisingly satisfying.  Recommended for all, young and old, who have seen the others."	4.0	Much better than the previous two!	2005-06-21	378	255	123

Depaola ""The NEW Wonder Woman"""	"I just saw the movie last night, and I was impressed with the special effects, costumes, and the story line. But I felt that although Hayden Christensen is great eye candy, his acting was weak and didn't seem natural. Natalie Portman looked great, loved her costumes, loved her acting. Everyone elses acting I felt was ""okay"". It didn't blow me away. The story was predictable, but of course it would be, since we all knew how it was all going to go down in the end. I felt the love story between Anakin and Padme was bitter sweet and sad, and the twin babies were so beautiful when she gave birth. A very tragic story and ending, but that is what gives way to ""star Wars, The New Hope"". Episode III is worth seeing and owning, though it is a bit long and the fight scenes do drag on slightly."	4.0	IT HAD TO BE DONE THAT WAY...	2005-05-23	1	0	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1ZU731IFILMV4	"Demonic Kelvin ""Dark"""	The entire movie is full with tremendous special effects which I can say the best of all sci-fi movies. I am truly stunned by all the graffics and visuals in this movie especially during the fighting in space in space battleships early of the movie and the fighting part with lightsabers. No doubt it is the very best technology can made in a movie.Unfortunately, I am expecting much more from this movie. Besides having a magnificent visual effects, it needs a good story and plot as well. Director George Lucas try to emphasize the romance between Anakin(Christensen) and Padme(Portman) in this movie by showing how much Anakin loves and cares about Padme. Anakin is even willing to embrace the force of darkness to prevent Padme from dying. But the problem is, this feeling of LOVE in the entire movie is not appealing at all. The feeling is like falsely made and I can't feel it. I don't expect it to be like Titanic regarding the romance but just a little bit more real and touching will be fine.Besides, this movie focus too much on the battle and fighting scenes and this made the whole movie very stiff and meaningless. George Lucas can't expect to impress the critics just with merely the visual effects. To produce a truly good movie, it needs to fulfill all the aspects needed such as the plot as the whole, the expression of characters, soundtracks, and the acting of the casts. Hence, this movie is still considered not really outstanding if rated overall the aspects.Furthermore, I am confused with the story. Anakin supposed to be the chosen one to bring peace and stability to the force. Why in the end can he become the malicious and evil Darth Vader that help the evil Palpatine to rule the galaxy? The story turns haywire and it's opposing the story brought by the first episode.Perhaps George Lucas is just trying to connect this story with the fourth, fifth and sixth episode which had been filmed years ago.But still, this movie isn't so bad. Most of the Star Wars fans will be amazed and fascinated by the superb visual effects in this movie. It's the best among all the Star Wars episodes.	3.0	Magnificent But Meaningless !!!	2005-06-02	7	2	5

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2FRKEXDXDN1KI	Dennis A. Amith (kndy)	As a fan of Star Wars, I absolutely loved the movie.  I couldn't wait for the DVD release and on Nov. 1, fans got their wish, although with different choices.What was interesting, unlike many blockbuster films that are released on DVD, Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith received special treatment.The three sets featured Obi Wan Kenobi, Mace Windhu and Annakin Skywalker.  The hard-to-find second set features Darth Sidious, Darth Vader and Count Dooku.  The third set featured three clone troopers.As for the DVD, it does not disappoint.  The audio and video is stunning.  The DVD comes with two discs.  Disc one features the main movie (and the dancing Yoda easter egg).The second disc is jam packed with Star Wars Episode III goodness and features six never-before-seen deleted scenes with introductions by George Lucas and producer Rick McCallum.Also included on the second disc isa full-length documentary titled Within a Minute, a featurette on Annakin's transformation to Darth Vader in The Chosen One.  A featurette on the training for the jedi battles in It's All For Real.  Fifteen web documentaries of the making of SW:ROTS.  The music video for John Williams A Hero Falls.  Theatrical teasers and 15 TV spots.  Theatrical posters and print campaigns from around the world.  Never-before-seen production photo gallery.  A playable demo with two entire levels for Star Wars Battlefront II for the XBOX and Star Wars Empire At War.I can't say how much I love this DVD.  If you are a Star Wars fan, the third episode for the Star Wars series is a definite must-buy.  Even for the casual movie fan who is not a big fan, it's just a very good movie.The DVD looks and sounds beautiful and more than enough special features to keep you busy.

Sure, the special effects were amazing, and like the other two prequels, it is visually stunning (and now that I have the DVD I like to pause during specific scenes and just LOOK at it), but I kept cringing at much of the dialogue.However, now that I have the movie on DVD, and I've been able to watch it a couple more times, I'm not as turned off by the dialogue.In a way, Episode III is a lot like Episode IV in that those two movies are the most ""literary"" of the six movies.  Episode IV was like an ancient myth set in outer space with a bunch of archtypal characters (the wizard, the princess, the farm boy, the pirate) on a journey to destroy a dark villain.Episode III is almost Shakespearian, combining elements of Macbeth, Richard III, Hamlet, Othello, and Romeo & Juliet.  The story itself is a perfect example of tragedy:  the hero who tries to defy fate ultimately succumbs to that same fate.Even the dialogue doesn't bug me as much as it did.

From the opening you feel and impending doom on the Characters, all of them, and of course, if you have seen 4-5-6 You know why.But even though the end is there long before the opening logos go dim there is still the urge to root for the outcome that doesn't hapen, or if your a darkside kinda person, Does happen so in your face, and I guess that's what make this a cut above them all. Lucus is just punching you with the story, since in the past he tenderized us with Ep 1 and 2.The movie pushes by pretty fast for all those wanting one more Yoda fight, one more Anikin battle, and one more Obi Wan overacted line. This is the cream of the crop in a galaxy far far away, and Lucus knows he has us, this is why wated till the end to smack us with it. The Dark sides pretty dark, and this movie is pretty fantastic.	5.0	Lucus pulls no punches with this one.	2006-05-21	12	6	6
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AXMPBUWHJGHGO	Desperado	"NOTE: this review may contain some spoilersThis is a very dark film indeed. I really have a great time watching the film.However when the film first begins there is alot of ""cheesy"" humor involving battle droids. In Episode 1 and 2 they only talk when one gives command to another. In this film however they now have small talk, they have feelings they even scream in pain when they get killed (those droid fighters sound alot like jawas or ewoks). I am a bit puzzeled about it. But that humor quickly dissapears when Dooku makes his appearence.(WARNING SPOILERS BEGIN). I felt sorry for Dooku because he comes in with all of his arrogance but that dissapears in an instance when he becomes ""helpless"" thanks to Anakin Skywalker.(SPOLIER ENDS).After the battle the film slows down we get to see Anakin And Padme together, talking about there possible future on Naboo for there ""baby"" But sadly we all know it is not going to happen.(WARNING FROM NOW ON SPOILERS) Then the film really gets dark when Darth Sidious is revealed, there is a lot of bloodshed. We see ALL the Jedi getting slaughtered at the Temple and in the battlefields across the galaxy. We also get to see two former friends duel at the hell hole called Mustafar and we all know only one will walk away. That is my favaroite scene in the film. So in the end, the Republic is destroyed an Empire is forged the Jedi are now becoming extinct. and the Sith finally get there revenge and rule the galaxy.But in the end there is still hope.......(A note I now look at The Phantom Menace and Clones a lot more differntly in a more favoraibly as well as the Orinigal Trilogy)4.5/5 stars"	5.0	Twilight of the Jedi, Twilight of the Republic	2005-05-19	6	5	1

In fact, I don't.  But that's besides the point.  Badly directed, with an overabudnace of cgi vainly attempting to cover the lack of story and characterization, Revenge of the Sith is the final insult in a long line that began with the dreadful Phantom Menace and the three hour toy commercial War of the Clones.

Wake up, whiners. This is the movie where we see Darth Vader's origin. It's not going to be light and fluffy: it has to be dark. You know people are going to die; you know it's not going to end happily ever after, but this is what everyone has been waiting for. You want a happy feeling? See this movie, then go watch the original Star Wars. The happy ending is there.This is easily one of my top three favorite Star Wars films. Let's go over the highlights: Grievous was awesome. Palpatine was incredible. Yoda was ridiculously cool. Hayden Christensen (Anakin) didn't whine this time. Chewie shows up, and of course, so does Vader.Of course, there were some low points. Anakin and Padme's romantic dialogue is still a bit cheesy. Grievous wasn't in there enough. Still no explanation as to why Leia remebers her mom and Luke doesn't. Oh, and Vader moves too much like Frankenstein when he gets off the table.But these are minor quibbles. This movie was spectacular. The audience was going crazy when I saw it, because this is the Star Wars movie people have been wanting to see since the prequels began in '99.

However, I've seen all three new ones multiple times in theaters and the third one is my second favorite in the series. Like anyone not very use to Star Wars, I have to watch each film several times to understand exactly what's happening, but Episode 3 is by far the easiest to grasp and is very enjoyable to watch.Ever since the originals, I've wanted to know why Darth Vader was the way he was. I think Lucas did a really great job leading up to Anakin's fall. Anakin is now my favorite character. The duel with Obi-Wan is really great and the love story was especially interesting to me. I would have liked more definite placements for the twins but the ending scenes with them lead in nicely to the proceeding movies.The music was also incredible, especially the variations of the love theme and darth vader's theme. I also enjoyed the hero's song though I thought it was overused.My only complaint is the length of the movie, but Star Wars wouldn't be Star Wars unless it was long.

The main thing about this movie that pisses me off is the horrendous acting, by almost the whole cast. The only good actors in this whole movie were: Natalie Portman, Ewan Mcgregor, and the guy who played Darth Sidious. Even Samuel Jackosn's acting was kinda stiff. But I guess you can't act good when the screenplay sucks. Although the movie's action and beautiful special effects completely counterbalance that. Along with Ewan and Natalie's fine acting skills. The fight scenes in this movie are even more vivid and better than the first two combined. The one and only thing that they would have had to do to make this movie near perfect would be to do away with Hayden Christenson altogether, I don't care who else they get to play the part, but anyone would have been better than him.Besides some bad acting this movie is perfect in every way, even the storyline (which sucked in the first two) was pretty good. My favorite part of the movie was when they first put the mask on Anakin, which was the most powerful and memorable scene. This movie was very dramatic and is the most emotional of the series.

Anakin Skywalker was a handsome warrior who turned to the darkside because he wanted more power than he could have.  The opening we see Anakin with Obi, fighting aliens and rescuing the Chancellor.  But it is the Chancellor that will bring down Anakin and lure him to the dark side.  He feeds on Anakin's fears and anxieties.  He wants to be Master of the Jedi but there is already a master and he has little patience with the politics of the galaxy.This movie was great to watch.  There are political as well as religious undertones to this movie.  The political is wanting too much too soon which destroys the people and the self.  It compares to the story of Lucifer.  He was once a good angel until he let his vanity get the best of him.  Anakin let his vanity and his strengths get the best of him.  He wanted to fight against injustice but he wanted too much power and recognition and it cost him dearly.Ewan McGregor does a great job in his role as Obi Wan-Kanobi.  He played the role very well as his predecessor Alec Guinness.  Hayden Christensen role was both romantic and tragic.  Let's not forget the other celebrities like Samuel L. Jackson and Natalie Portman.  They were very good in their roles.George Lucas is a gifted director.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3EJYJC25OJVKK	"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer"""	"Although I've often disagreed with a lot of those whove said that the previous two Star Wars prequels were pure garbage, as those two have sunk in over time, I have noticed the glaring problems that dogged those two films. The first one ""The Phantom Menace"" almost felt like just special-effects galore although the Pod Race was a classic but they really missed their chance to make Darth Maul an excellent villain! The second one ""Attack of The Clones"" on average was a moderate improvement on the first but even that one had glaring problems. The worst of all was Anakin Skywalker. No offense but Hayden Christensen's acting of Anakin was among the lousiest acting and the character Anakin overall just comes off as being little more than just some whining brat who lost his video games in space!  The story dialogue was questionable during parts of the last two as well and while I still enjoyed them and still do for all their faults, I can see where the criticisms are coming from. ""Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith"" however unlike the previous two is a dynamite finish to the prequel trilogy and a glorious finish to the Star Wars saga. George Lucas's mistakes are for the most part corrected on here. ""Revenge Of The Sith"" is a grand improvement on the last two and finally puts ""Star Wars"" firmly back on it's feet after all the trouble it went through in the last six years.Three years into the Clone Wars, Anakin Skywalker is slowly but surely moving further and further towards the Dark Side of the force. At the same time, the galactic Republic has been battling increasingly dangerous and powerful separatist forces led by Count Dooku and General Grievous. The planet Coruscant is now under attack and Obi-Wan Kenobi who is now a Jedi master and Anakin who is a Jedi Knight travel over to Coruscant in order to combat Dooku and Grievious, the latter of whom is a far greater threat to the Republic. The leader of the Galactic Republic, Chancellor Palpatine however has become increasingly corrupt, and increasing government powers into a concentrated set of parties has been increasingly at odds with the Jedi Order and many senators who haven't bought into his increasingly corrupt ways have been growing tired of his long overdue stay in his position as Chancellor. Anakin Skywalker however has been growing closer to the Chancellor and has been taking in his teachings about the Dark Side of the force. As Anakin sides more with the Chancellor, including finishing off Mace Windu during a battle, he starts coming into conflict with the entire Jedi Order and even begins falling out with Obi wan Kenobi. Add a third problem, Anakin has been having nightmares about witnessing his wife Padme Amidala dying in childbirth and strives to do everything in his power, even by doing bad things, in order to prevent that from happening. Whatever happens the outcome will be the same, the seeds of a much larger conflict have been sown and will determine the fate of the entire galaxy.Many of the mistakes that were present on Episodes I & II are corrected or reduced to minor on Episode III. Although I like many was not impressed by Hayden Christiansen's acting in the last movie, in my opinion though, I am absolutely amazed at how much he improved on the final episode of the saga. For someone who came off not much more than a whining brat on AOTC, Anakin now finally looks a lot more like a blossoming villain. I just cannot believe how much Hayden improved on Episode III. Ewan McGregor improved on here from the last two as well although he's still no late Alec Guinness in my record book. The characters are also far less wooden in personality and the dialogue is MUCH better than before. The special effects are also incredible! The battle at the beginning of the movie is awesome to watch and the `mosquito-like' droids are really funny to watch. The water like Bubble in the center of the room during the scenes where Chancellor Palpatine teaches Anakin the negative/Dark Side of the force is really beautiful to look at and is one of my favorite CGI effects I've ever seen. Sure some scenes were a bit awkward at times due to occasionally wooden acting by some but overall though, everything is back on track on the finale in the prequel trilogy. I don't care what people say, this is just an awesome end to the Star Wars sage and Lucas finally brings his 30 year franchise to a biblical close. Mr. Lucas, thank you very much for nearly 30 years of great movies from Indiana Jones to Star Wars. If this is truly the final installment in the saga, then it's a wonderful way to go.Although I wasn't even born when the ""New Hope"" and ""Empire Strikes Back"" and was only an infant when ""Return of The Jedi"" came out, I've always loved the originals and they are classics. The prequels however I remember vividly and while they were enjoyable for what they were, they were somewhat disappointing and were hard to digest. ""Episode III"" however is a glorious return to the glory of the original trilogy and closes the Star Wars saga on a glorious note. Episode III is MUCH darker than it's predecessors and the ending is very sad but it sets the stage for the beginning of ""Episode IV"".  There aren't really any spoilers for Episode III since a vast majority of us Star Wars zealots already know the originals. We know what happens at the end of the movie but overall though, it's how it all happens that really makes this an intense closure to the saga.Even if you didn't like the last two prequels, I strongly recommend that you go and see ""Revenge Of The Sity"" as soon as possible! It's that great."	5.0	A glorious finish to the timeless Star Wars saga!	2005-05-25	7	4	3

I was 8 yrs old in 77 when Star Wars hit the box office. I've been a faithful opening day attendee through all its sequels. I, as most, thought the story was done after the fall and redemption.  Episode 3 is very well filmed and the abundance of effects have kept up with the newest available technology and should keep the die-hards and the younglings very entertained.The warning that should be stated is the path of Anakin from good to otherwise is dark and is complicated by love, power, obedience, and loyalty, which can all create very positive constructive discussions between parents and their children regarding these common everyday virtues and temptations.My son pondered if Anakin could have done things differently. My daughter scowled everytime Anakin spoke with Palpatine. Her words, ""He's bad, I don't like him.""There are many harshly critical reviews posted on this list, but truth be told, if you've seen the rest, you must see the final puzzle piece to tie up all the loose ends.  Lucas dropped the offensive footage to maintain the below 'pg/r' rating. Yet, this is not a light film.  There are many subplot areas of deceipt, manipulation, temptation, and malevolence.  Lucas brought us full circle, and it was a great ride cover to cover.PS at 2 + hours, you'll need more than a 3-pack of popcorn. Stock up."	5.0	No Spoiler review	2005-10-26	4	3	1

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A26ARHFAD8X0WR	"D. J. Zabriskie ""zabdart"""	"While ""Revenge of the Sith"" is certainly the best episode of the second triology of ""Star Wars"" movies, it suffers from the same drawbacks of the other two installments, mainly from scriptwriter George Lucas' inablity to write plausible, intelligent dialogue for his characters and his inablity to develop character and conflict in any way other than dazzling action sequences.  Indeed, the action sequences become both surrogate and substitute for character development.  The one exception to this rule, however, is noteworthy.  While the inner-conflicts which lead young Anakin Skywalker to turn to the Dark Side of the Force and his inevitable destiny as Darth Vader are never fully or plausibly developed, the evolution and ultimate immolation of the relationship between young Anakin and his now fully-developed Jedi master Obi-wan Kenobi is what gives this film its true interest and lifts it above its two predecessors.  Alas, that strand of plot and character development is just one of the many things happening in ""Revenge of the Sith,"" and as such is given rather short-shrift.As you would expect from Lucas, the special effects are stunning and revolutionary.  There are light-saber duels galore, for those who are addicted to them.  Yet that begs the question: weren't they more emotionally effective in the first triology, when they were used less frequently and were the core of the movies' climaxes?Ultimately, what defeats ""Revenge of the Sith,"" more than its overreliance on special effects, more than its frequently sappy dialogue, is that Lucas has too many story strands to weave together and resolve in this installment.  The result is that none of these important story lines is given adequate development.  You can't tell where the real climax of the movie occurs, since there are so many stories climaxing not at once, but in sequence, so the denouement goes on for too long, and provides not summing up, but anti-climax.But what did you expect?  Lucas never intended, while making ""Star Wars"" to do anything but make a space-opera with a little sci-fi mythology thrown in for good measure.  What he got, especially after the success of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was to create a phenomenon in pop-culture myth-making.  The charm of the original ""Star Wars"" triology was that it was unashamedly aimed at the 12-year old in all of us, and while we watched its magic unfold on the screen we could be 12 years old again.  In the nearly 20 years between the end of the first triology of movies and the beginning of the second, we all aged, and that inner 12-year old became harder to find.  The PG-13 rating this movie carries deprives it of the very audience it was aimed at.  Yes, it's dark, far darker than any of the other ""Star Wars"" movies, but it's still a KID's movie.The fault with ""Revenge of the Sith"" lies as much in our expectations of it as it does in its own shortcomings."	3.0	Well, What Did You Expect?	2005-06-18	10	8	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A24FFQ2OD0KN1P	D. Marks	When Darth Vader spoke that line after realizing Luke hadn't been frozen, was he really talking about Luke, or did he forsee Revenge of the Sith?This film is spectacular. From the truly amazing super-sized battle in the opening sequence, to the shocking graphic of a legless Anakin being fried in lava and combusting. In between were the also impressive senate chamber battle between Yoda and Sidious, the encounter between Sidious and Mace Windu - forcing Anakin to make a choice, the humorous and fascinating look at Kashyyakk, the wookie home planet and General Grievous' 4-handed lightsaber display. Also, thankfully, the ultra-dull Dooku made a quick exit. Questions were answered, loose ends tied and the dull love scenes between Anakin and Padme were minimal.I don't get why alot of people who are old enough (as I am) to remember when the original Star Wars premiered seemed so disappointed with the first 2 episodes. Maybe some of the reason is because the original movie and trilogy were so cutting-edge for their time, people were so amazed that these new films can't possibly match the feeling you got the first time you saw Star Wars. Yes, Jar-Jar's humor and speech were over the top in Ep. 1 but aside the film was almost non-stop action, new aliens and awesome battles. We all loved Darth Maul, the final battles had plenty of drama as well as action, the trip through Naboo's core was a wild ride and the podrace sequnce was fun too. In Ep. 2, granted the love scenes didn't need to take up 1/4 of the film, but remember how many people hated the Ewoks and they had quite a huge chunk too. Also like Jedi though, it had plenty of action to carry it through, Obi-Wan vs. Jango Fett, the speeder chase and an unrivaled collection of Jedi fighting at one time in the arena battle. It filled alot of the in-betweens and background such as Boba Fett, Owen and Beru Lars, the seeds of Anakins turn and the clone wars. It also gave us the first ever look at Coruscant- Han Solo's home.Reguardless, in my opinion, of the 6 total films Revenge of the Sith is easily top 2 along with Empire Strikes Back.	5.0	"""Impressive!"" - (Lord Vader - Ep.5)"	2005-08-13	4	2	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2HBRINA3F9YHV	Doctor Trance	"Adventurers, Explorers, Kung-Fu fighters, Super Heroes, these are what little boys dream of being from ages 6 to 12.  Star Wars, 1977, a mystique was born, that after a brief resurrection, has now died.  The Star Wars magic is no more.  It was a unique magic, a Force to be reckoned with, that seemed to somehow surpass all others.  Every boy could withouth hesitation, dream of being Luke Sykwalker, or Han Solo, fighting evil across the galaxy, and winning a heroes welcome.Whiffle ball bats became light sabers in our friend's backyards.  ""I want to be Luke"", ""no I do"".  Not many of us wanted to be Darth Vader though, or the dark side, or evil.  We all saw the good in Luke, in Star Wars, and just who wouldn't want to win out in the end, or be the good guy who squashes all the baddies.Star Wars was fun, it was about good triumphing over evil, and an adventurous drive that never burned out.  In all 3 of the original films, with the exception of Obi Wan (whose death was by no means brutal and it turned out to be a blessing to the force) no hero dies, no fun is killed off, no losers in the end.  We all have fun watching the heros have fun; we are all entertained; we are all swept away in this galaxy, which for most of us, could never be that far away.We learned from the original trilogy how Luke's father became a Dark Lord with the help of the Emperor, and many other things about in the SW timeline before the 1st movie.  Most of these things were bad: the Jedi dying out, Luke and Leia's mother not surviving, Anakin turning evil.  All bad things.  Well, who wants to see bad things?  Wouldn't we have rather seen 3 films in the ""further Adventures of Luke, Han, Chewie, and Leia fighting evil in the galaxy and being heroes"" saga than a prequel that we all know is about evil winning?  ABSOLUTELY!Instead, Lucas attempts to go back to the dark times, and create some sort of good out of it, some sort of entertaining movies that he thinks the majority of the SW viewing public would rather see.  I believe he made a grave error.  Now, I loved Phantom Menace, as that Star Wars magical adventure seemed to set sail again.  A thilling, FUN ride through the universe with the majority of the heros winning out, aside from that one exception almost paralleling Obi Wan in the 1st film (Qui Gon).  The magic had again arrived.On to Attack of the Clones, which straight from the opening get-go, was flat out un-Star Wars like, and very unspectacular.  I mean, how can you compare Amidala's decoy getting blown up to all the other 3 film openings (a massive space battle and the arrival of Vader on Leia's ship; the battle on Hoth; the rescue of Han Solo from Jabba; and most recently, two jedi walking into a spacebound trap, only to muscle their way out with the help of their illustrious light sabers... sabers we had not seen for 16 long years).  ATOC just didn't hold up, and there was no winning in it, it only seemed to leave our heros lingering and meddling through a dreadful script.  It also introduced the worst actor in the SW universe, Hayden Christensen.Christensen is one reason which pulls Revenge of the Sith back into mediocricy, back from it's otherwise glorious display of action and light saber duels.  With the way too sudden and very unbelievable transformation Anakin takes to transform to the Dark Side, it would have been extremely difficult for any actor to pull it off, let alone a horrible one such as Christensen.  One second there still seems to be some good, and some conflict in Anakin's thinking, and literally within moments, he is bowing and on one knee, calling Palpatine his Master.  Very, very contrived and hard to swallow.While the light saber duels were spectacular enough to keep your mind off the drenload of CGI going on behind everyone, there was still not enough of the magical SW locations to drool over: Hoth, Tatooine, the palaces of Naboo, were all long forgotten and replaced with studios and green screens.Every good that is good in SW (with ironically, one of the few exceptions being Obi Wan) get killed off.  All the heros are gone.  No one to root for, no magical carpet ride to keep us flying into the sunset.  Even poor Yoda and Obi Wan are forced to hang their heads in exile.  For Obi Wan, the exile on Tatooine didn't do him very good justice, as he leaves ROTS looking about 35, and in 20 years time to A New Hope, he seems to be 65 years old.  Very strange.  Anakin also appears to have aged 30+ years in the time it took Luke to grow up to be a 19 year old boy (judging by his holo image in ROTJ).Who wants to read a comic book, have a spectacular dream, or fantasize about heros dying, villains prevailing, and all that is good in life being demolished.  Not very many of us.  Let's ask ourselves why any of these prequels needed to be shown.  Hadn't the horror stories told to us by the original trilogy characters been enough?  Plenty, to me.All in all, taken on it's own, out of the Star Wars universe, it is an action packed movie that any kick-butt action flick afficianado can love.  However, for those who still have that little boy inside, who is still yearning to go back to a long time ago, and fight, save, and be the hero of a galaxy far, far away, our time in the Star Wars universe has past, and it's a time we may never see again."	3.0	A Long Time Ago, in every boy's fantasy, Far, Far Away	2005-05-19	9	6	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A17II2K378G36C	Dominic Ponder	"It's impossible to provide a film review of Stars War Episode III: The Return of The Soth, as it is in fact an uninteractive computer game and not a film. And as uninteractive computer games go this is a dud. Actors talk in ridiculous bland English accents and computer pixels dance manically across the screen so that the viewer has little idea what is going on and cares even less. Yawn-fest action scene follows yawn-fest action scene and everyone longs for it to be over quickly as it looks like a rubbish computer game. This confirms that the trilogy of Stars War prequels are the most absurd ""films"" ever committed to screen. Cripplingly uninteresting characters and shambolic storytelling, but delivered with a pomposity that suggests that the production team actually believe that these are important works.I was sceptical when told that this film was better than the previous two. Not sceptical about whether it would be better - The Frantic Menace and Attack of the Cloves were so utterly awful watching a hessian sack decompose would be more entertaining. What I was sceptical about was how substantial the improvement could possibly be given the shambolic context and wafer-thin background served up by the earlier shockers. Making a successful film off the back of those two duds would be a process akin to building a full-scale replica of the Taj Mahal on a mound of slippery hamster poo.We may marvel though that technological advancement now means that films look less impressive than they did almost 30 years ago. Star Wars (Episode IV) released in 1977 looks far better than the disorienting soulless computer-generated mess now served up to represent the galaxy far far away. No super cool Han Solo sparring with feisty Princess Leia. No, we're stuck Ewan McGregor highlighting how much better Alec Guinness was, and a chap called Hayden doing the most compelling study of evil since Todd Carty in Krull.This is an overlong simplistic fairytale that Lucas cannot stop telling, even though the overgrown children he is meant to be telling it to have fallen asleep or died through boredom."	1.0	At least that's the end of it !	2005-09-29	31	15	16

And, it's true--they're not as good as the older set. But Episode III is definitely the best of the new films. While Hayden Christensen's acting is still atrocious (""Mannequin Skywalker"" hah!) and while he and Natalie Portman really have no chemistry and while George Lucas' dialogue is awful at times... well... there's some real heart to this film that none of that stuff can take away.The basic story of Anakin's slow turn to the Dark Side of the Force is powerful. Ian McDirmid is wonderful as the seductive Chancellor Palpatine and Ewan McGregor is solid as a youthful Obi-Wan Kenobi.Of course, most all hardcore Star Wars fans will have already seen this movie several times, but we should also realize that this film isn't anything to be ashamed of. Even though it doesn't have quite the same magic of the first three Star Wars films, it's still a good movie on its own merits and tells the story it needs to tell.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AU83LSQXCBR94	Doug Taylor	"I, like most Star Wars fans, have deep roots in the series that date back to my childhood. As long as I can remember, I have hummed bars to John Williams' opening theme. In middle school, when the original trilogy was re-released into movie theaters, this nerd showed up at opening day for each movie, proudly shelling out the five dollars it took to get inside.However, the last three movies, the prequels as it were, are disappointing to a fan that saw these movies as something more than the physical action and science fiction explosions that every fan I have encountered seems obsessed over. The original movies were about a coming-of-age boy chasing his dreams, only to find out his father, his hero, is more interesting than he ever imagined - human - and in true Sophocles style, he has to kill his father to achieve his dream. Each character seems rich and interesting - from the foam puppet Yoda to the protagonist himself. The story paints in generic broad strokes, and it was not groundbreaking, but it was an interesting story.The last three movies, and Episode III is no exception, feel like a video game. The fan is constantly aware that the skylines and spaceships are computer-generated images (CGI). Lucas' filmmaking has moved the technology along, but it seems as real to this viewer as those old Disney movies like ""Puff the Magic Dragon"" when ""Puff"" was literally a hand drawing. Beautifully done, each frame saturates with visions on CGI that it is distracting. Lucas has broken the first rule of story telling - do not distract your audience; keep on message.I cannot tell if it is an editing problem or just that most of the actors are staring at green-screen for the production, but dramatic scenes in the movies are almost laughable. For instance, as Padme, the wife of Anakin Skywalker-turned-Darth-Vader, is confronting her husband, the dialogue is forced and the emotion seems empty.The test of this viewer is to watch a new movie without the famous name that is attached to it. In my opinion, if Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith were the third Star Wars movie and not the sixth, the box office returns would have been poor. The movie leaves this Star Wars fan with an emptying sense of fulfillment, and even less money in his wallet.Mr. Lucas, I have seen all three of these movies, and I want my 20 dollars back."	1.0	Revenge of my Pocketbook...	2005-08-22	36	21	15

Like how does Anakin Skywalker get seduced to become Darth Vader?Criticism:The real quandary for this film, doesn't involve us deciding to view the film.It's whether I should bring my son to watch it, or not?  I haven't figured that one out, yet.  Some violence is more explicit, and some involve young Jedi Knights, etc.My young son, like all his friends, loves Star Wars, but he is certainly not any where's near 13 yet!  And, I am not sure he can handle the violence, or if I should expose it to him.You really have to take some time to figure this answer out for your kids, regardless of how much they love Star Wars.	4.0	The Last of an Epic Drama	2005-05-20	7	3	4

It explains how Anakin becomes Darth Vader very well and I also like how well it ties the old movies to the new ones. George lucas is a fantastic director. The work he does on these movies are out of this world. This movie should be called the best movie of the 21 century because the time it takes to make, the good graphics and the amount of people that likes the movie.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1FIRU9R4GC1LF	Draykov	"George Lucas conceptualized a world that would eventually capture the hearts of millions. With the help of talented individuals like John Williams, Ben Burtt and Ralph McQuarrie, he brought it to life. For many of the children of the 70s and early 80s, the Star Wars phenomenon served as a monumental inspiration that would resonate throughout their lives. Mr. Lucas' contemporary attempts to return us to a galaxy far, far away don't seem to have quite the charm that the original Star Wars trilogy did, but Star Wars - Episode III: Revenge of the Sith comes the closest of all the prequel trilogy films to recapturing the feel of the original vision as it was presented to audiences over twenty years ago.One could argue that nostalgia has tainted the perception of older Star Wars fans or that twenty plus years of built up expectations make it impossible to deliver a follow-up film that is as widely accepted and loved as the original trilogy films. The fact remains, however, that while Revenge of the Sith is a stunning film visually, it's hard to say that any negative criticism levied against it is just the result of OT fan-boy bias. Mr. Lucas did have his work cut out for him in creating this final installment of his beloved franchise. Certain fatuous events were set into motion in Episodes I and II that could not be undone in Episode III. As such, it's hard to judge Sith solely on its own merit (or lack thereof) given that the foundation of its story was more or less laid down in the first two prequel films. Midi-chlorians? Immaculate conception? Jar-Jar Binks? How did these ideas pass through Star Wars QC? What it really all boils down to, though, is that Sith suffered some of the same setbacks that its prequel predecessors did: too much style, not enough substance. Take for instance the character of General Grievous. Conceptually, this was a cool character. General Grievous: a half-droid, half-alien military mastermind who dabbles in lightsaber combat. This had the potential to be a great character for our protagonists to come up against. But he shows up out of nowhere very late in the game (i.e. the third film of the prequels) and for what? To run away repeatedly? Why the silly cough? Is this what passes for character development in the Star Wars universe these days? This character undoubtedly took a lot of time to create and bring to the screen, but he served little to no purpose. Anakin's abrupt turn to the Dark Side (what should have been the most interesting point in the whole saga) is a part of the story in desperate need of some beefing up, yet we spend time watching General Grievous strut around in serious need of some Robitussin. Background characters like the ones we saw in the Mos Eisley Cantina of Episode IV can be fascinating without needing a lot of back-story, but Sith throws allegedly important characters into the mix that serve no other purpose than to move the plot along by getting main characters to chase them to the next scene. I would've preferred a more congruent, believable story to spending screen time needlessly on characters like Grievous, Tion Medon and even Count Dooku. I would've been very happy if I could've seen Darth Maul (from Star Wars - Episode I: The Phantom Menace) develop into a deeper character and eventually serve as the apprentice Anakin kills and replaces.I might be in the minority, but I felt like the dialog and acting in Sith was not quite so deplorable as a lot of critics would have you believe (with one or two glaring exceptions). Ian McDiarmid steels the show as the evil Darth Sidious. I'm sure we've all been wondering when the wise and noble Jedi were going to pick up on the fact that their nemesis was right under their noses, and the scenes involving Sidious/Palpatine are pretty darn satisfying. Ewan McGregor delivers a more emotionally attached performance than he was able to pull off in Attack of the Clones. That isn't intended to be a criticism of Mr. McGregor, but a nod to the fact that he was given more of an opportunity to actually act in Sith. On the not so impressive side, Hayden Christensen's Anakin has a manner that's just too contemporary for me to buy him as an up and coming Jedi with power heretofore unseen in the Jedi Order. His interaction with Natalie Portman in particular seems unbelievable and contrived, though in his defense, that might not be the fault of his acting. In spite of a few problems, his performance is improved compared to Episode II. There was only one moment in Sith where I just rolled my eyes and sighed at the cheesy dialog (Jar-Jar is more or less a no-show for Episode III, thank the maker), but it was pivotal. I feel so bad for James Earl Jones. The guy was 50% of what made Darth Vader so cool and interesting and frightening and and he was given some real garbage to spout out during the ""Franken-Vader"" scene. ""Nooooooooooo!!!"" Give me one huge break, please.With all of that said, Revenge of the Sith is an entertaining, if conceptually overloaded, film. It is arguably the best prequel film, but it wasn't the end I felt the saga deserved. Given the weak framework put in place by Episodes I and II, the deflated end to the once critically acclaimed sci-fi/fantasy chronicle can't all be blamed on Revenge of the Sith. Unfortunately, though, I was left wanting more when the curtain closed on Star Wars (and by that, I don't mean an encore). I'll continue to imagine an Anakin/Obi-Wan back-story that would have been ideal from my own perspective...one free of midi-chlorians, Jar-Jar and fatherless Jedi.As for the DVD in particular, you can expect the same quality demonstarated in the previous two Star Wars prequel film DVDs.  The bonus disc, to be honest, was a little disappointing.  However, in my case, that was because I had already seen most of the disc's content on the Star Wars website prior to the film's initial release."	3.0	An improvement on previous prequels, but that's about it...	2006-02-24	8	5	3

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AH8JZMWED0LBV	Drew	"A Star Wars movie is the kind of film many people feel they really ought to see, regardless of whether they think it will be good or awful (the adjective ""awful"" when used to describe a Star Wars film didn't become appropo until the release of the reprehensible ""Episode 1: The Phantom Menace""), in large part because Star Wars and aspects of its fictional universe have become such a normal and enjoyable part of our own universe.Unlike the previous two releases in the ""prequel trilogy"" franchise, I noticed that there wasn't as much advance hype concerning this one compared to episodes 1 and 2 (both of which, in my opinion, were mediocre, if visually-stunning, films). There wasn't as much ballyhoo regarding the release of this film in the form of toys and other tie-in merchandise. Maybe there actually was but I just didn't notice, because I just don't care as much anymore (I was only 15 when Episode 1 came out but now I'm 21), but I didn't even know there was going to be a new Star Wars film until about two weeks before ""R.O.T.S."" 's May 19 release date.With ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones"" being relative disappointments, I watched ""Revenge of the Sith"" with a very condescending attitude toward the movie. I was prepared to be disappointed and I actually thought I'd be treated to a movie so ridiculous that I'd have a whole new set of ""Starwars'isms"" to refer to in a mocking way (like that howler of a line Annakin Skywalker delivers in Attack of the Clones where, in response to Padme's ""You're not all powerful, Annie,"" Annakin replies with an ear-screeching whine, ""Well I should be!""). I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. True, there are still script-bombs in this movie, such as the oft-discussed (and disgusting) ""I love you,"" ""Well I love you more,"" ""I'll miss you,"" ""I'll Miss you more,"" ""You hang up first,"" ""No, you hang up!"" exchange between Padme and Annakin, but overall this movie is seriously up there with the original trilogy in terms of overall entertainment.The good thing about this movie is that parts of it are lame (such as the boring and distracting segment with Obi-Wan on the planet Utupau, riding that kimodo dragon-like thing) but they work with the other parts of the movie, which are good.The viewer gets a better understanding of Palpatine and his motives, which is central to the movie. I also like how his rather bizarre appearance in Return of the Jedi is accounted for in this film.Also nicely resolved is the height-discrepancy between Annakin Skywalker (who looks tall enough at about 6'2"") and Darth Vader (who is very tall at about 6'8""), as it involves reconstructive surgery at the end of the movie. Also very entertaining is Ewen McGregor's performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi, especially in this film as his appearance really does resemble a younger Alec Guinness (who played the part in the odler trilogy). When he scolds Annakin at the end of the movie, one actually feels that Obi-Wan's heart has been broken.Not so good things about this movie include Padme's character (not the fault of Natalie Portman, but of the script and director) who went from strong-willed, confident modern woman to a cringing, whining, befuddled and male-dominated Victorian stereotype. Maybe this is part of the story, but it just got a bit annoying. Also not so good about this movie are the moments where Annakin stops wielding his lightsaber and resorts to exchanging any sort of dialog with other characters (perhaps Darth Vader wasn't always a machine, but Hayden Christensen's performance even before his character became a robot is irritatingly droid-like).The lightsaber duels were on the whole excellent but all the leaping around and quickness don't seem to match up with the duels in the later (earlier) films, which were just as emotional if not as acrobatic.Overall this is a fine film but upon a second viewing certain inconsistencies show up. Other reviewers have already harped on these so there's no sense in mentioning them again, but if other viewers are anything like myself, they will tend to look upon the classic trilogy as a complete set, with this new trilogy being interetsing but ultimately, except for ""The Revenge of the Sith,""  not tying into the whole story all that well, either extrinsically or intrinsically. "	4.0	A wonderful film the first time around	2005-06-24	0	0	0

Having said that, this is a dark tale [no-pun intended] and a real heartbreaking one as well. It is also an excellent Space-Fantasy in its own right, and is the best of this recent Star Wars Trilogy in my opinion. We do get to see how Annakin somehow went wrong and in so doing, ""TURNED TO THE DARK SIDE!""We also get to see just what Yoda meant in ""The Return of the Jedi"", when he told Luke ""not to underestimate the power of the emperor, or suffer your father's fate you will!"" Before the ""Revenge of the Sith"", we could only guess what that, and other references to the past meant, and imagine them for ourselves. Now our imagination has been replaced and/or confirmed with facts. With this final film of the prequel trilogy complete, the Star Wars universe has just expanded enough to bridge the gap between what had transpired during the original trilogy and their prior causes, as illustrated most graphically with this now fully operational prequel trilogy. For that reason, ""The Revenge of the Sith"", is the most important film of the new trilogy, and is almost essential viewing for anyone wishing to fully enjoy the original trilogy now available on DVD in an enhanced edition.Of course whether or not George Lucas' continued tinkerings with the original trilogy represents enhancement is totally up to the individual.ABOUT THE DVD: I prefer the Widescreen editionSpecial Features include some very neat featurettes, a couple hours worth, and the deleted scenes which show Padm&eacute; Amidala plotting with the anti-Palpatine movement.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A38UH7VCINQJ0F	D. Sullivan	"As this is the summation of the epic that is the ""Star Wars"" saga, I felt compelled to submit a review which sums up my experience with it, focusing, of course, on ""Revenge of the Sith.""In 1977, I had the great fortune to be a 7 year old boy in a 1-screen (!!!) theater watching ""A New Hope"" in its debut. 28 years later, I can recall that experience with amazing clarity. When ""The Phantom Menace"" debuted, I was hoping for a similar moment. Maybe, I thought, the bar might be set a bit higher - what with new technologies in place to flesh out the effects.Suffice to say, I will echo a lot of fans like myself and say that the moment did not happen. I will admit that the effects were taken to a new level, and I enjoyed them thoroughly. ""Attack of the Clones"" was similar for me in that respect, and ""Revenge of the Sith"" raised the bar even higher in that aspect (which is admirable, for it didn't seem possible).But, as I said, the magic of the first films was not there for me. What's the difference? Well, I didn't need to consult any reviews to recognize poorly written dialogue, nor actors who seemed so loathe to deliver such writing, that they mailed in their performances. But, were the first films about acting? Did not the effects blow my prepubescent mind in the late '70s and early '80s?When I fell head-over-heels for Jackson's pentultimate fantasy-genre epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, the answer to the ""Star Wars"" puzzle became clear: I need to be convinced. That is to say, the story and the actors need to be good enough to make me invest emotionally in them so that the grandiosity of the visuals have their full intended effect. The arguments of old school vs. new school Star Wars fans holds no purchase here; it's just basic moviemaking mathematics, if you will. (Not to give Jackson too much adulation here, but his ""King Kong"" shows how the improved storytelling  - via the emotional connection between Kong and Ann Darrow - vastly improves an already seminal 1933 version. Sure the new effects are incredible, but they would have rang hollow without the rewrite.)""Revenge of the Sith"" does a better job, character-wise. Yet, the dark tragedy of Vader, sad as it is, is not voiced with the power it should contain. I am not well-versed in the films of Hayden Christensen, so I can't truly say that he is a good or poor actor. However, his portrayal of what should be complete anguish and misplaced rage comes off as adolesecnt petulance, increasing in volume rather than intensity when things come to a head. There's a marked improvement over the whining he aspired to in Episode II, but it kept me from caring the way I feel I should about the tragic story of Anakin/Vader. What improvements there are in his rendering of character came too late.As for the rest of the ensemble and their performances, it's a mixed bag. As was not the case in the previous two installments, the mix is better this time around. Ian McDiarmid and the CG characters of Yoda and General Grievous are totally convincing.McDiarmid hits the perfect note as an archetype of evil in his portrayal of Darth Sidious/Emperor Palpatine. It's so very close to parody, yet never crosses over, and that very thing shows McDiarmid's pedigree.I am ambivalent about ""puppet Yoda"" vs. ""CG Yoda,"" as Frank Oz is still a factor in the character, and the character has not been lost in the new technology. He is still endearing, enigmatic, and backwards speaks still he does. His saber fighting is more convincing this time around than the crazy-bedbug fight with Dooku in II. He's still more mobile than you may give him credit for, but he's no longer a 33 RPM vinyl album put on 78.Grievous is new, and I don't know of his biological-to-mechanical history, nor of his backstory as a separatist, but I like him. He's an outsized cyborg Napoleon, complete with swoopy cape-coat, eccentric mannerisms, and megalomaniacal arrogance. His pride is such that he fails to recognize that he is in need of a cybernetic tune-up, and has to pause for coughing fits while striding around in a looping, reptillian gait. These little touches make for a well-drawn (on a Wacom pad?) character.Portman and MacGregor are fine actors. But in this film, Portman has been replaced with a wooden facsimile. MacGregor seems to be in a fog. I've heard the excuses with regard to acting to suspended ping-pong balls in a green-screen studio, but the ""Lord of the Rings"" cast had to endure the same, and their overall performances are vastly superior. It's got to be the uninspired dialogue. Lucas should have gotten a full-time dialogue writer and director for I, II and III. The very premise, not to mention the excellent actors at his disposal demanded better. Acting is a 2-way street, and you're only going to get as good as you give. The story was so strong in III... why didn't they see the dialogue hadn't risen to the same level? My questioning is rhetorical in the fact that we'll never see a real answer from those involved.Yes, we end on the highest note possible with regard to the prequels, and for that I am grateful. But the history of this saga shows that the highest points happened a long time ago... in this very galaxy."	3.0	We'll always have Alderaan	2006-01-13	3	2	1

We already know what happens after Episode III so it was not a matter of WHAT happens, but rather HOW it happens. I was really surprised to see the scene with Anakin burning, as I was surprised by the scene with Anakin and Windu in Palpatine's office. I always thought these two were deformed only because of the dark side. I couldn't imagine that Vader would have 1st degree burns and the Emperor would be actually responsible for his own deformed looks. If you are one of those people who believe that Episodes IV-V-VI are superior, you might want to watch this one. The previous two were filmed just so that Lucas could make a trilogy. Episode III is awsome and worthy of the Star Wars Legacy. Even small stuff received attention, such as Ewan McGregor's hair which were made to look like Alec Guiness's. I totally disagree with Hayden Christensen as a Vader choice. He just doesn't look or talk ""dark side"", even as he tries to. Many people say that they chose him because he looks like a younger Mark Hammil (Luke Skywalker), even though Lucas denies that. Ian McDiarmid on the other hand gives it all as Darth Sidious, especially when he attacks the members of the Jedi council in his office. His expressions are unbelievable. In ALL the other episodes he just plays it cool behind the scenes or on the Death Star, but now he really gets involved. A glimpse of the imperial ""decor"" in the final scenes brought back memories, and so did the Death Star (still under construction in Episode III). Lightsaber duels seem to be the feat of the day since everyone fights - even a droid (with 4 lightsabers no less). Obi Wan loses his saber in a scene and is forced to use a blaster, making a comment about ""uncivilized weapons"", just like Alec Guiness in Episode IV. The highly anticipated duel between Obi Wan and Anakin was not as impressive as I imagined it. The duel between Darth Maul, Qui Gon and Obi Wan in Episode I was much better and enjoyable. I will not buy this DVD though. I'll wait for the entire I-II-III trilogy pack in fullscreen mode (4:3)."	5.0	The thin line between dark and light	2005-07-27	3	2	1

All of these variables combined with bit of George Lucas magic yield...a TOTALLY AWESOME movie experience!Unless the reader (or the film-goer) has resided in a cave for the better part of three decades, there are not many surprises in Episode III.  Annikan Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) has been tilting toward the ""Dark Side"" even before he sliced through the Sand People like a hot knife through butter in Star Wars, Episode II - Attack of the Clones.  All he needed was a little coaxing from Emperor Palantine, who moonlights as the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid).  While there have been many, another huge plot hole opens (like a sinkhole in an upscale residential development in Florida) when the Annikan realizes near the end of Episode III that he has destroyed the very purpose that he chose to apprentice for Darth Sidious in the first place.  One would have to think that with all that training, a Jedi Knight would have a little more sense than to fall of the old, ""Trust me, I promise it will feel good"" trick.  Without that plot hole for poor, thick-headed Annikan to fall through, however weak or empty, Star Wars would not have its antagonist, who is perhaps the most well-known villain in a generation, Darth Vader.Like the original Star Wars movies and in the previous two from the first trilogy, the quality of the acting is suspect.  Christensen's Annikan Skywalker is sometimes painful to watch.  Christensen is this decade's answer to Matt Dillon, monotonous, single-dimensional, and dull.  While she has clearly demonstrated in other films great talent and range, Natalie Portman, whose hairstyles in Episode III range between frightening and hilarious, is (and has been) only barely functional as Padme Amidala.  Ian McDiarmid's Emperor Palantine is serviceable, while Samuel L. Jackon's, who portrays Jedi Master Mace Windu demonstrates his talent under what appears to have been a hurriedly directed picture.  Once again, however, Ewan MacGregor, who plays the young Obiwan Kenobi, is the real talent of Episode III (and if the entire trilogy, for that matter.)  MacGregor seems as controlled and confident as an actor as Obiwan does as a Jedi Master.  Apparently, he could work under the most difficult of circumstances with the thinnest of direction notes and still create a memorable character and performance.Other interesting and fun facts about the actors in Episode III include Frank Oz who provides the voice of Yoda, James Earl Jones' completes the ""Circle of Life"" and returns to play the voice of Darth Vader, and George Lucas himself lends his vocal stylings to bring Count Grevious alive.  (It was actually a family affair for the Lucas'.  There were a bunch of them among the cast of small-roled characters.)So, what exactly makes Episode III such a TOTALLY AWESOME movie experience?Well, unless a person also happened to be one of those Chess Club members and Dungeons & Dragon players in high school and had already read `Revenge of the Sith,' the movie patron learned a bunch of things.  First, the viewer discovers how the Empire was formed and why the Jedi were forced to live in exile.  Next, the Star Wars devotee learns how Luke and Leia are orphaned and the reason the two raised separately.  Finally, Jedi Wannabe finds out how Annikan becomes Darth Vader and the reason he wears the infamous black cap, mask, and helmet.  (Inquiring minds want to know!)If that were not enough, the real star of the show is the special effects, which are once again outstanding.  The droids and robots have become almost more real than many of the ""human"" characters, and the Jedi battle scenes with these mechanized and artificially intelligenced bipeds almost convince the viewer to seek out Yoda and submit to a Jedi apprenticeship.  Everything from the dogfight scenes to the light sabre battles to the more tranquil cityscapes, the special effects are tremendous.  At the same time the special effects make Episode III, as it has the other Star Wars movies, what they are, those same effects do actually contribute to the darker storyline.  While other installments of Star Wars included violence, the violence in Episode III is quite a bit more graphic and darker as Annikan embraces his ""Dark Side.""In Episode III, the audience without question knows what he or she is getting into.  There will never be an Academy Award for acting or directing for any of the Star Wars movies.  However, Star Wars is a mostly very fun and exciting, if not a completely logical epic story, and is a fast-paced, intense ride that delivers movie fans at the foot of Luke Skywalker himself.  Still, it is a strange feeling having finished the first of the Star Wars trilogies knowing exactly what will happen next.  Now, however, what fans really need to know is what happens after what happens next?I hope we do not have to wait for another generation to find out!"	5.0	What happens after what happens next?	2005-10-29	17	13	4

Loved the action in Attack of the Clones but hated Hayden Christenson - he's much better in this.

But the best thing about this film is it totally stands up in its own right as a sci-fi/action classic. You don't need all the backstory, you can just relax and enjoy a truly awesome adventure.	5.0	Out of this world effects!	2006-08-08	2	1	1

I actually like some of the hoky fun of low budget sc-fi channel movies but this MAJOR theatrical release with a huge budget and brand name stars simply reeked of imcompetent writing and direction. THE worst acting I have seen in years.Sure the FX are pretty but it all ends there. ""Climactic"" fight between Yoda and prune head (palpatine)- not climactic at all. I actually laughed every time palpatine spoke because the sith style voice effects were just so horrible.The only saving grace of the film is its darker overtones but they are too in-your-face. Look how EVIL Anakin is!!! He's EVIL!!! oohh, who cares!!!My girlfriend laughed through the entire film. I found out afterward that the only reason she didn't walk out of the film was because we were with other people.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A17LD2AH9K9GJD	Dylan	"Well, I got back tonight. Here's my review.I first saw A New Hope when I was around five years of age, and I remember being completely hypnotized by it. The original saga quickly became my favorite movie, and I remember begging for only one thing for Christmas when the new VHS Trilogy came out. I collected the toys like they were cocaine, trying to get my hands on every one I could find. I always found that ROTJ was my favorite Star Wars film when I was younger, I always loved the final battle between Luke and Vader...But as I aged, I found that Empire was the strongest film, as many would agree. All in all, I loved all of them. Star Wars was the event of my early childhood.Oh, fun times.When the prequals first came out, I was around eight or so. I remember being so very excited for Episode I that I was litterally jumping up and down on my bed an hour before. I loved Episode I that day, and I continue to love it. Though many hate it for it's childish ways, I always thought it kept that magical spark the originals had. Then Episode II came along. What a disaster. It wasn't horrible, but it was pretty bad for a Star Wars movie. A weak script, horrible acting from Christensen, boring action sequences, ect. ect. Perhaps the only thing that could redeem it was that it was indeed, Star Wars. Heh, I remember discussing with my friend about the prequals, saying ""Wow, I'll be in High School when the last one comes out!""Now, after having to wait a week, which was like going through labor...I got to see ROTS. I've tried to stay out of the hype this time around, making sure not to get my hopes up like I did for AOTC. Though, as I just said, I was litterally dying as I had to wait to see it. So, I guess, even while I tried to stay out of the hype-It was still Star Wars. It was in my blood. From an explosive opening that hasn't been matched since Empire, I knew that we were getting back into the space opera that I had learned to love. As the movie went fourth, I was simply loving every minute of it. Sure, Christensen still can't act, but at least he was better in this than he was in the previous installment. Of course, that's a given. I knew going into it that he was going to continue to be a stump, but that's alright. None of the Star Wars films have ever had really good acting anyway.To finally see the transformation of man to machine was finally before me, presented in two and a half hours. Though I think the I-Turn-Evil-To-Save-Padme was sort of a cop out, it really didn't take away from the enjoyment of the film. I suppose I just have to accept the way Lucas wants to tell the story, and if he wants the entire reason of his demise to be centered around his longing for love...Then so be it. I'll roll with it. That aside, about everything else about the film worked. Of course, there are some minute details that felt wrong, but I'll leave that for the end. Let's focus on the good for now.It was simply fun seeing a huge battle in the opening, enough eye candy to keep me happy for quite some time. I haven't had this much fun in a theater since Episode I. So, the film started off with a bang, a loud and perfect one at that. Most of the people I've talked to said the film was sort of boring for twenty minutes afterward, but I rather was into it. I enjoy seeing Padme and Anakin discussing their problems, the politics of the Republic, ect. ect. Once Anakin begins to fall into the Dark Side, as Palpatine starts to twist his mind, is really where it all starts to take off. I always imagined it this way from the old movies, thinking about how someone could be so darned evil. Obi Wan said in Episode IV that Anakin was a pupil of his, so I always assumed that Anakin was a nice guy that was influenced by the Dark Side and he was never evil to start with.Once Order 66 is ordered, the film just turns into the most pleasing and rewarding experiences that I've ever felt in film. The Jedi Die. Anakin does everything (including murdering children) to save the only one he desires. Yoda continues to show us how powerful he is. It's perfect. The ending is just...perfect. The final battle between Obi Wan and Anakin was wonderful. Seeing him cry out in pain and get burned to bits was strangely satisfying. Sounds horrible, but I'm glad that I actually got to see the gruesome details...It added to the ending. By th end, I was just so...satisfied. I had sat through a good movie. I was happy I saw it. I'm happy to have all six of them right infront of me. Even as bad as Episode II was, as a whole, it seems to fit. It all comes out good.Now, for the minute details I didn't like.*Anakin's final words in the film. If he would have said the ""Where's Padme...Nooo..."" While he was still burned, on the operating table, instead of in the James-Earl-Jones-Voice-Masking, it would have been a lot more emotional.*The Fight with General Grevious was far too short. I was expecting something epic, but I got meh. There was a lot more that could have been done....That's it. Not much to complain about. Heh.All in all...It was great. Excellent. I'm glad to see that it's all over, and I know that these films will stand the test of time."	5.0	Well, it's all over.	2005-05-26	9	7	2

Day ""ENIGMA"""	"Im sure if you think long enough and mix the letters I-T-H up enough times, you can fill in the word im thinking of. Yes, I know you probably ask how I can make such a harsh comment, yet give it four stars. Well, first off let me start by saying that I am a diehard Star Wars fan (which is the only reason it gets that many stars) that has probably seen every movie well over a dozen times. Yet, one of the aspects Ive loved in every movie (seen mostly in the original trilogy) was there were nonstop surprises and shocks. The first of the trilogy set in 1977 was well ahead of its time, and pretty much every thing one saw was new fresh and unexpected, from the light sabers to the Death Star exploding. The Empire Strikes Back, well I think ""Luke I am your Father"" ranks in the top Five of all shocks of the past Millennia. In Return of The Jedi you met Jabba, found out about Luke having a sister, you saw him grow into a jedi, take out Vader, and what we all were wondering (just what does daddy dearest look like under that mask). Now to the new trilogy---The phantom was fairly fresh with unique ideas, in that you found out about the mini cloridians, saw Darth Maul and that cool double edge Light saber, and you get to meet a wide array of fresh characters that many fans had wondered about (Padme, and Darth Sidious) I wont go much into attack of the clones because outside of seeing Yoda work a light saber that was complete waste of film and a number of fans time. Now, to Revenge, was it a bad movie? No, not really................but I gotta say I was very disappointed in that there really weren't any surprises save possibly why Skywalker went to the Dark Side. Some have told me that finding out Sidious' true identity in the movie, was a shock to them, but to those two or three individuals in the world who couldn't tell who it was in Phantom Menace i got another shocker for you, there is no such thing as Santa either(I mean talk to Scooby and get a clue)Yes, I would see REVENGE the movie again, Yes I will be first in line at Walmart when it comes out on dvd , and yes I will always miss my occasional visit to a galaxy far far away. However to all you fans out there like me, please don't set the bar to high.

But this one comes close to being as good as the originals, now some said that the dialogue in this movie is preety bad. BUt what Star Wars films has had great dialogue? Dialogue is not the reason why people go see SW. But to my Opinion the Dialogue  was preety decent, at least better than the last two, let's just say it got the plot going faster.THe Special effects in this  movie are the best effects i've seen in any movie. The action sequences specially the light-saber fight scenes are really well done and choreagraphed. This sw film had more action than any of the other ones. The acting was alright, I specially liked Hayden Christenses's performance this time, I think he did quite well.The plot, well everyone knows already what was gonna happen in the end, but like I said this movie is packed with action, and to  my opinion this is the best Star Wars film since, Empire Strikes Back.	5.0	Great	2005-08-21	3	1	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AH0K6KAO3N1RH	E. Dolnack	"Give the man his due: ""American Grafiti"" and ""THX-1138"" are thoroughly ground-breaking filmatic endeavors and both are stunning as well as brilliant. George Lucas can create art when he wants to. The problem is, most people choose not to recognize it when he does. My theory is that most detractors of the Star Wars Prequels would have also ""dissed"" American Grafiti and THX-1138 when they were released.The main problem with the three Star Wars Prequels is that they try to tell two different stories, and do so in a messy fashion. The ""upfront"" story is the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker. The ""back story"" is the rise of Emperor Palpatine and the fall of the old Republic. The first story is told easily enough in the formula of the original trilogy - taking place in real time for the most part and seeing the story unravel through the main character's eyes. But the Prequels tell a much larger story than do the original Star Wars Trilogy and the original formula is obviously shortcoming here.If I would have made the Star Wars Prequels, I would have done something unorthodox in a Star Wars movie and added narration overtop the action. Narration is probably the only way to tell such a large scoping story easily so that everyone in the audience understands. I would have began Episode I about ten years after the events of Return of the Jedi, with an aged Luke Sywalker, now a bearded and long-haired Jedi Master like Qui Gon Jinn, instructing a new generation of Jedi Knights and telling them the story of the fall of the old Republic. I would have then faded the image back to show a flashback back in time to events in the distant past. The entire Prequel Trilogy could have been narrated by Mark Hammil and fans everywhere would have loved that, and loved seeing a glimpse of their old favorite characters in the future. There would have this been no need to bring R2D2 and C-3P0 into the Prequels, or any other characters from the original triolgy other than Anakin Akywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi.That's where the Prequels failed in my opinion: they tell the story of Anakin in a decent way, but fail when telling the wider-scope back story of the fall of the Jedi and the old Republic. The action often skims over the widely-important events that are occuring throughout the Republic; events that we, as the audience, need to realize are happening and fully unedrstand their depth and scope. Lucas often can't tell which story to tell and often falls short of really telling either in a satisfying way.But as it stands, Episode III ""Revenge of the Sith"" earns my vote as the third best installment of the now Star Wars sextet. If pressed, I would rate the Star Wars films in the following order of quality:1. Episode V ""The Empire Strikes Back"" - still the crowning acheivment of the entire series.2. The original Star Wars (actually, Episode IV ""A New Hope"") as number two.3. Episode III ""Revenge of the Sith"" being the third-best of the series.4. Episode VI ""Return of the Jedi"" being forth.5. Episode II ""Attack of the Clones"" fifth.6. and Episode I ""The Phantom Menace"" coming in dead last."	5.0	A Very Good Film in Most Respects	2005-10-04	11	3	8

Lucas wrapped up (or prepped up!) for Episode IV really nicely.

I thought the allusions to 4, 5, and 6 were great!  (The only thing missing was Han!  I'm going to look for him when I see the movie again because I simply can't *believe* he was ""left out"" because all the other major players were there, including the relatively minor bad guys!)But this movie was too short (or the time in 1 and 2 mistakenly  used).  There was no time in Sith for the character relationships to develop, so Anakin often seemed indecisive, something I don't really think suits his character at all.  The first 20 minutes were the best when he really seemed to **absolutely** know what he was going to do no matter what:  he was *going* to pull ObiWan's butt out whether ObiWan liked it or not and then ObiWan was going to like it!  If he had stayed that way throughout instead of kind of giving up that determined and controlling aspect of his personality that shows itself ""later"" in the other movies, the tragedy would have been more powerful.  Because in that first sequence (probably just included for the action value), for the first time, I loved Anakin Skywalker.  I really *believed* he could have been the greatest of all the Jedi.It's funny, isn't it?  Anakin was lost because of love.  And he was found because of it.  In case you hadn't noticed, that makes him, probably, the central figure of the Star Wars myth: not Luke or Leia or Han or any of the rest, as much as we've loved them for 30 years.  On May 19, 2005, they all became players in the story of Anakin's life journey.  I'm not even sure that Lucas realized that when he was ""filling in the back story.""  After all, Luke was the one he named after himself. :)I liked this movie very much but could easily have been enticed to like it better with a few more carefully chosen character nuances and a bit more time to see Anakin's devolution."	4.0	Anakin	2005-05-25	6	4	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3Q524S1DGUQNT	elionwy18	"I was brought up on Star Wars. I still have the original three in their original boxes that came out in the 70s and 80s, and I've watched them numerous times. I can quote lines from every movie, and I disavow right now any knowledge of prequels. They have killed Star Wars, and I refuse to acknowledge them as such.I, like so many others, was so excited about Episode I. I couldn't wait to see Anakin Skywalker turn to Darth Vader, and I was excited about the director explaining some of plot holes in the originals. By Episode II, my faith in the so-called ""brilliant director"" had been badly shaken, but I still resolved to give Episode III a chance. I'm truly sorry that I did.The prequels are a disgrace to the name Star Wars. They have disregarded everything previously established in the original movies, as well as the extended universe. So many plot holes were not cleared up, and many new ones were created. How did Padme manage not to age at all while Anakin has gone through three seperate stages of growth? Was it a rift in the space-time continuim? Leia says she remembers her mother in The Return of the Jedi, but how could she possibly if the stupid woman dies in childbirth? Are we to assume that she can retain memories from when she was first born? Is that some sort of galaxy far, far away ability? Why would Anakin be afraid that Padme would die in childbirth? Surely in a galaxy where we can build spaceships to travel to the farthest ends of the universe, we can save people from dying in childbirth?There are just so many unanswered questions in this one, and so many insulting implications. Are we to assume that Darth Vader, the same Darth Vader who in the originals was a very evil and apparently loved being a very evil villain, was duped by Senator Palpatine into being evil? Are we to assume that he slaughtered children (or ""younglings"") for love? Does he think his wife will love him now that he's the most evil man in the universe?More nonsense. Anakin's transformation to evil is really, really quick. Besides being portrayed terribly by a hormonal and very feminine Hayden Christensen, Anakin was the one who mercilessly slaughtered Count Dooku, and now he begs Mace Windu not to kill Senator Palpatine because it's against the Jedi Code. Does that make sense to anyone? And Lucas, we all love wookies, but there's no point in just throwing in random characters in the hopes of earning the approval of Star Wars fans. It's like Boba Fett in Episode II, which I still haven't forgiven you for ruining.What else can I say about this terrible film? Oh yes, the politics. Like many celebrities, George Lucas should really just leave politics out of his movies. He tries to be a Bush-basher, and fails horribly, with stupid lines like ""Only a Sith speaks in absolutes."" The Jedi are the ones bent on killing the Sith because they're all evil, and the Sith speak in absolutes? Hmm...I guess the end was supposed to be moving, and I guess it would have been if it wasn't so comical and ridiculous. Especially the end, with Vader's agonized ""NOOOOO!!"" sounding a lot like Emperor Zurg from Toy Story. It made me laugh, I don't think it was supposed to.I'm giving this movie two stars for one reason, and that reason is Christopher Lee. Yes, he was killed in the first fifteen minutes, but he still managed to pull off a better performance than any of the other actors combined throughout the entire film. I think he should overall have gotten more screen time in the movies, and maybe he could have saved them, but I sincerely doubt it. Not even Mr. Lee, the master of making pure trash great entertainment, could save this terrible movie.Sure, the special effects are fantastic. But as Lucas said in the Making of Star Wars back in the 80s ""a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing."" Yes, it certainly is. Thank you, Mr. Lucas, for proving your point."	2.0	"""No reward is worth this"""	2005-05-31	26	16	10
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1OCOT9XQ1FBSW	El Jimmy	It's unfortunate that this is it, the end of the Star Wars saga. There are rumors that Lucas will be putting out a live action tv series to kinda bridge the gap between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, showing some of the surviving Jedi and how they fight Vader, and ultimately get killed. But its still not a movie.I was not a fan of the first two, Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, but Episode III brought back something that was missing since the original trilogy: You actually care about the characters.  You actually find yourself giving a damn this time, whereas you wanted that annoying kid in Ep I to get stomped on and for the adult Anakin in Ep II to get slapped and to stop whining like a girl. Ewan McGregor has improved as Obi Wan, as has Hayden Christianson, although Natalie Portman is still dull as Padme.  Everyone knew who Darth Sidious really was, but how he turned everything into chaos and became the Emperor was interesting to see.  If you are a die hard Star Wars fan, I recommend reading the book first. You'll enjoy the movie more (however, the Yoda on the wookie planet was omitted from the book) and will understand, emotionally, why Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader.Is this the best in the saga? I still say no, that Empire Strikes Back still has that title. One thing the new trilogy lacks completely is one thing that made the first trilogy memorable: COMEDY! There is no Han Solo-type character, and Jar Jar Binks providing comic relief was a big mistake (thankfully, Lucas realized this and used less of him in Episodes II and III.) Lucas' mistake was directing the films himself. The better Star Wars movies weren't even directed by Lucas (Irvin Kershner for Empire, Richard Marquand for Return of the Jedi, but would have been Steven Spielberg were it not for the Directors Guild preventing it) The dialogue could have been better, the films may have flowed better, stories told better (I personally think Episode I could have been told in an hour and they could have used the second hour with a more adult Anakin Skywalker).Lucas learned to direct much better in Episode III, but unfortunately cannot show more of what he's learned since obviously its the end.  The rumored TV series may show some of it, but like I said, its no movie.	4.0	An end to an era	2005-08-24	4	3	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3QQUBOKHGRY3G	Elle Michelle	"I am very anti sci-fi.  It has just never appealed to me.  In fact, I had never even seen any of the Star Wars movies until recently.  As Episode III came out in theatres, I decided it would be wise to give myself a little 'star wars marathon' and watch the all the movies, in the order that Lucas put them out (4,5,6,1,2,3).  After I saw Episode IV, I have to admit, I was a little lost and bored.  So I figured I'd go on to see what V had to offer, and I was very impressed.  I found myself wanting more.  So I continued on to VI, which i again, enjoyed.  Then on to episode I and II, which were just ""okay"" in my book, often feeling that the movies just dragged on.  Finally, it was time to tie all the movies together so I went and saw Episode III in the theatre.I have to say that I was VERY PLEASED with the movie.  As soon as I walked out of the theatre, I felt as though I needed to turn back around and watch it again!  Episode III might qualify for one of my favorite movies within the Star Wars trilogies (episode V being my personal favorite)!  I think the acting and pace of this movie was 100 times better than that of episode I and II, and I definetly think that each actor developed a better grasp of their role, especially Hayden Christensen, who I thought was horrible as Anakin in episode II, but just wonderful in episode III.  I feel as though Lucas did a wonderful job linking all 6 movies together.  And yes, there are some holes in the plot here and there, but I think that any series that went on for 6 episodes would have its setbacks.After seeing all these movies for the first time within a weeks span of time, I find myself VERY ADDICTED!  I still feel as I need more, and keep hoping that this really isn't the end to the Star Wars Legacy!  If Lucas could turn me (the epitome of anti sci-fi)into a Star Wars FANATIC, then I feel that just about anyone could fall in love with these movies, especially episode III!"	5.0	addicted.....	2005-06-06	8	4	4
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1KB3USMSFCAPA	"El Steve ""roark413"""	"I truly can't believe how this film can get good reviews.  Yet again, George Lucas brings us terrible dialogue, along with some of the worst acting I've seen in quite some time.  I shudder to think that these acting hacks will receive royalties from the continued running of these films.Haydn Christiansen's acting was so bad.  so forced.  so pathetic, that i truly believe that had they chosen to use Tracy Ullman with a fake beard and mustache, they might have gotten a better performance.  Kudos to the only actor showing some depth of performance in the form of Senator Palpatine, ranging from a caring benefactor...to an evil Sith Lord.And most of all, what this movie does NOT show me is WHY Anakin went from a loving, ""I'll take care of you Padme!""-type of guy into a child-killing, ""yessssss....masssster..."" type of villain!  It doesn't work.  And I refuse to believe that people can actually suspend their disbelief to come to terms with that leap.  Of course, a large part of the country voted for George Bush and continues to think that the billions we spent on war was justified, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised at the extent of America's self-delusion.  what did make me chuckle in the end was when Darth Vader yelled out, ""noooooo!!!!!"" when he believed he had killed Padme.  For some reason, it reminded me of Ned Flanders from the Simpsons.  I don't know why.This film sucks.  Do not buy it.  Rent it if you will.  But rent it with 10 other people, as that will make the rental price worth the crappy movie you will end up seeing."	2.0	"Lucas Puts the Crap into ""Crapola"""	2006-01-02	22	9	13

There were so many other directions that Lucas could (and should) have gone with the pre-quels and in this writers oppinion, he missed the mark.I'll grant you, Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen are delicious eye candy, but it doesn't make up for the lack of tangible plot and the poor writing.George, I'm sorry.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AQZH7YTWQPOBE	Enjolras	"There are a ton of things I could gripe about with Episode III. I'll discuss a few below. But by and large, this is the best of the prequels and, in my eyes, ranks pretty highly as a sci-fi film.First, the bad. This should have been more than one film. Rather than a whole film for the events in The Phantom Menace, the Clone Wars could easily have consumed a whole extra movies. Unfortunately, squeezing all of this into Revenge of the Sith means that a lot of important footage was cut. Fortunately, it's all in the deleted scenes section of the Bonus disc.I'm also not crazy about the way Palpatine's character is used in the film. I love Ian McDiarmid, but the whole introduction with kidnapping Chancellor Palpatine seems a bit silly. I also don't think the whole ""aging"" process after the battle with Mace Windu worked.However, these are minor quibbles. Overall, the story works. Hayden Christiansen is a believable Anakin/Vader. Moreover, his reasons for turning to the Dark Side are more compelling and realistic than the motivations of most movie villains (I won't spoil it, but it makes sense). It explains the final fall of Vader in a dramatic and compelling way, with great special effects to boot.With Revenge of the Sith, it seems like Lucas and the case of the prequels finally got their act together for this grand finale. The death of the Jedi is simply haunting - a perfect combination of camera angles, soundtrack, and acting. Let's be honest - 30 years ago, when we all wondered about Darth Vader's background, nobody ever thought it would be this exciting. I just wish this much thought and passion had gone into the rest of the prequels."	5.0	Best of the Prequels	2010-01-18	2	1	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3A6O7SC8LKXDL	EPA316	"I think George Lucas really let it all out for this last one. No more holding back like in Episodes 1 and 2. When you watch this movie, you want to yell out to Anakin KILL HIM! when he has his lightsaber pointed at Palpatine towards the end of the movie. That would have spared himself and the galaxy so much suffering. The only weak point in the downfall of Anakin, I thought, was how he was suckered into believing his wife was going to die. They could have expanded on that a little more, because I was not convinced. That whole ""Padme's going to die"" angle seemed a little vague to me, and that was the main reason he went over to the dark side. And that brings up the only other point I don't like; why exactly did Padme die? She was choked for a few seconds; big deal. The medical droid said she was healthy. Did she die of a broken heart? What, having two kids didn't lift her spirits any? She loses the will to live because of the ex, and dies with 2 new kids lying there waiting for their mother? Hmmm.. not really buying that.. but anyway, other than that, this was a great movie. Lots of fun. The very ending leaves you wanting to see more of what happens in the 20 year gap between Episode 3 and the original Episode 4. I guess that's what the upcoming Star Wars TV series will be all about!"	5.0	Definitely best of the prequels	2006-06-30	2	1	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AXFI7TAWD6H6X	Erica Anderson	"I have grown up on the Star Wars franchise. I love episodes IV - VI but the first two episodes were pure dreck. I especially loathe ""The Phantom Menace"". Still I was anticipating chapter III when Anakin Skywalker stops being Anakin and becomes Darth Vader.""Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith"" is the final installment of the Star Wars franchise. Chapter I shows Anakin Skywalker as a young boy and how he ended up becoming the padawan to Obi Wan Knobi. Chapter II, Anakin has grown up and falls in love with Padme, the mother of his twins Luke and Leia. Finally in chapter III, moviegoers finally finds out how Anakin Skywalker becomes the notorious Darth Vader.I thought out of the first three chapters, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is easily the strongest. The dialogue is a bit weak but then again writing isn't exactly George Lucas' strength. The conversations between Anakin and Padme sounds like it could have been written by the writers at ""Days of Our Lives"". It was pretty cheesy. Thankfully I was pretty much distracted by the action sequences and other visuals of the film.The action sequences of the film were amazing. I loved the battle scenes. I love watching Yoda fight. You would never thought he was capable of fighting someone ten times his height after seeing him in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""The Return of the Jedi"" but he is. The final battle scenes were my favorite. They were very climatic and had me on  the very edge of my seat. The intensity of hatred Anakin had for his former mentor Obi-Wan Knobi certainly showed.I absolutely loved Ian McDormid's performance as the Chancellor Palpatine. His performance certainly stood out with me as did Ewan McGregor's as Obi-Wan Knobi. I loved Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu. He showed a lot of intensity through his character to the very end like he does in all of his films.The graphics in the entire film was amazing. Definitely eye candy. The storyline was more substantial than its predecessors. The action sequences were amazing. I even felt the same magic in this film that I felt in the last three chapters as a child. Even if ""Revenge of the Sith"" isn't perfect, it is still a killer film and a great way to kick off the summer box office season."	4.0	The end of an era	2005-05-23	5	2	3

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC	Eric J. Anderson	As a tour de force of digital special effects technique, this is a five star demonstration project. I'm sure it will drum up a great deal of future business for ILM, Lucas' special FX shop.My best capsule review for SW Episode III is: George Lucas succumbs to the Dark Side of digital filmmaking and forgets how to tell a story.The only part of this film that felt emotionally involving and believable was the final duel between Obi-Wan and Anakin. The rest of it was by-the-numbers. The characters did as the script bid them, but the audience cannot identify with and enjoy the characters like the original Star Wars Episode IV. Lucas has tried to turn campy comic-book fun (the original 1977 movie) into a legitimate drama and failed utterly.A very heavy book could be written on the lack of acting finesse demonstrated by Hayden whats-his-face. I know that Natalie Portman can act, but what happened to Padme? In Episode I she is a brave leader, and in this installment she's become a emotional doormat, her instincts completely overpowered by her (unconvincing) love and devotion to her immature husband. This is not Portman's fault. Lucas gets all the blame.My reaction to this is a big yawn. Lucas sucked all the fun out of Star Wars. I'm sure glad I checked this out from the library and did not waste even a couple bucks on a video rental.Then again, if all you want is amazing visuals, whether or not they contribute to involving and logical storytelling, be my guest -- this is the tops.	2.0	Unless you like special effects for special effects' sake...	2005-11-30	13	8	5

I will blame my 9-year-old nephew who made me take him.I was sooooo disappointed.  Star Wars - Episode III, Revenge of the Sith is a silly story, but good effects.If those so-called enlightened Jedi Knights would have used basic communication skills with Anakin, they could have saved the world.  Instead, they jerk him around and say he can't be a master.  Why not level with the guy and tell him he will be a master one-day.Don't waste your time on the most over hyped movie of the last 10 years.And to think people camped out to watch this movie? They are the ones on the dark side.If you want to watch good entertainment, find Triumph the Comic Insult Dog and his interview of Star Wars fans, from a few years ago.  Those who are `into' Star Wars are such losers who lack any sort of social skills.There is no deep meaning in Star Wars.  And as a movie, it has cool special effects (enough light sabers already!!!) and that's it.All I can say is I am so happy this is the last Star Wars movie!!!	1.0	Triumph the insult dog was right -  Star Wars stinks!	2005-05-30	43	17	26
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2TWLP80OY28S6	Erik Russell Olson	"...That's not exactly fulsome praise.It's difficult to keep everyone happy when you're making a movie like Star Wars - Episode III, Revenge of the Sith.  It has to be popcorn; it has to pay homage to a plethora of characters deeply ingrained in American popular culture without making them seem silly; it has to be kid-friendly; it has to be thirty-year-old-obnoxious-geek-friendly; it has to believably transform a good person into the most recognizable villain of all time; it has to live up to the common assumption (propagated by Joseph Campbell and others) that it is not just a story, but an epic MYTH; in short, it has to fill a seemingly endless array of roles, when most movies would be happy to fill one or two.And at times, George Lucas succeeds.But much of Revenge of the Sith still feels more connected to episodes I and II -- by all accounts a disappointing pair of movies -- than to episodes IV, V, and VI.  Hayden Christensen reprises his role as the precocious Anakin Skywalker, supposedly destined to bring ""balance"" back to the Force (but we all know what really happens).  He sniffles his way through the role, coming across as quite obviously headed down the wrong path.  You get the feeling, as the viewer, that George Lucas wants to make absolutely certain that we know this kid is going to end up on the Dark Side.  And yet, without spoiling things too much, the scene in which he truly makes his choice does not make sense from a motivational standpoint.  He supposedly gravitates toward the Dark Side in order to prevent his wife Padme from ever being harmed, but we're never made to believe that she is in any real danger.  We're left with a hamfisted yet unconvincing change of heart, which is both nonsensical and unfulfilling.Other characters don't fare much better.  Ewan McGregor does his best as Obi-Wan Kenobi, embarrassing neither himself nor his predecessor, Sir Alec Guinness, in a movie series that has seen more than a couple of embarrassments.  Natalie Portman is given little to do in her role as Padme, and most of her scenes come across as maudlin and overwrought (though to be fair, that probably has as much to do with Lucasian dialogue as her acting).  Surprisingly, even Yoda becomes tiresome, as an occasional verbal quirk from the earlier trilogy -- putting all his verbs at the end of sentences -- becomes a constant distraction here, until the content of his speech eventually becomes subordinate to his characterization.  (I don't know about you, but I have always thought being small, green, old, wise, and powerful was enough to set him apart.  He doesn't need every sentence to shout, ""Hey, look at me!!! YODA I am!!!"")  Perhaps only two of the villains (Christopher Lee as Count Dooku and Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine) are really entertaining, and both actors obviously enjoyed hamming it up for their respective parts.It isn't until much later in Episode III -- after Anakin has finally decided where his allegiances lie -- that the movie actually starts to get good.  Yes, the light-saber battles are overly long, and the dialogue which peppers them is bad even by Lucasfilm standards, but some genuinely moving things begin to happen in the last thirty minutes or so.  This is at least partly because of the very nature of Revenge of the Sith; while it closes up the newer trilogy, it also neatly sets up the older trilogy, which I think almost every Star Wars fan will agree is the better of the two.  In short, the end of this movie starts to feel good because it starts to feel like the Star Wars movies we geeks grew up with.  It starts to be driven by an interesting story, rather than by special effects.  We actually come to pity the most iconic villain in the history of cinema.  It's binary sunsets and the deserts of Tattooine.  It's the Death Star and the Empire's vast white mother ships.  It's deja vu in an entirely gratifying way.So you ask: is this movie worth seeing?  Well, the guys in storm trooper getups and wookie suits will watch anything with the Star Wars name on it, so don't bother asking them.  I'm not a hardcore Star Wars buff, but I actually did enjoy this movie, in the final analysis.  It doesn't redeem episodes I and II, but frankly, nothing will.  Walk into the movie knowing only that Anakin will become Vader, and you'll be pretty happy with it.One bit of trivia about episodes I, II, and III: Jar Jar Binks talks all the time in Episode I, and thereby ruins it; talks less in Episode II, though the movie is still awful for other reasons; finally in Episode III does not say a damn thing, and what do you know -- it's also the best of the trilogy.  We might have a meaningful correlation here."	3.0	The best of the new trilogy, but...	2005-05-27	8	6	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA	Ervin Griffin	"Before I review, let me say that while the prequel Trilogy isn't bad, it doesn't capture the magic of the original Trilogy. I can't put my finger on it but the new ones are just missing that something that the old one's had.That being said, Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith is by far the best of the three and holds its own against the original films. While I do agree with many reviewers in that I also don't care for all the CG, I think it was necessary in some scenes (such as the Anikin/Obi Wan fight on the Mustafar system with all that volcanic lava). Let's face it, old fashioned film making COULDN'T pull off some of those scenes believable enough!As for the story, it was easily best story and the best acted of the three. Episode I wasn't a great story BUT I surprisingly liked it only because the actors were putting forth an effort with the material they had. Plus, the Darth Maul Vs. Obi Wan/Qui Gon fight was tremendous!Episode II was a stronger story but it seemed at times the acting was on auto-pilot! I nearly fell asleep in the theater and I have NEVER done that with any movie let alone a Star Wars film!Episode III was over all the best story. I have to agree that Hayden Christenson wasn't the best choice for Anikin Skywalker/Darth Vader. True, he improved since Episode II but he was still lacking something. I wasn't all that convinced that he was confilcted though he was supposed to be. To his credit though, he got the dark side part down pat and he definitely knew how to weild a lightsaber!Overall, the actors did a great job in this one. Even Natallie Portman's performance in this one was much improved from the first two films (though that last scene where she dies was a bit hokey but that could be blamed more on the script than her acting).As for the DVD itself, its got plenty of extras on Disc 2! I haven't viewed all of them but the ones that I have viewed (particularly ""The Chosen One"" and ""Its All For Real"") are good.Overall, it is a good buy even for the die-hard Star Wars fans."	4.0	The Best Of The New Star Wars Offerings	2005-11-12	3	1	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2MVBF21SP3270	Evan Herberth	"This end-all film in the Star Wars saga was definitely emotionally packed. It has many shadows of the former Star Wars' message of morality and the fight between good and evil; sadly, it seems that it was really depending on the message that had been set in the preceding films, without actually carrying much of its own weight (which, though I am not very creative, I believe it had the potential of doing).The movie confuses its own moral message with what seems to be an antinomic philosophy coming from both the Jedi and Sith. A friend, with a smile, suggested that perhaps towards the end of the film, at the beginning of the Anakin/Ben Kanobi battle, George Lucas took a short break and allowed Michael Moore to write some of the dialogue.So, though the movie provides some philosophical beef for wishful-thinkers, for those who truly like a ""unified theory"" and a sum-over philosophy of ethics and morality, this movie is a disappointment (especially considering the ""shoulders"" upon which this film was standing, and which it was expected to match or supplant). After all, the Sith believe that good is just ""a point of view,"" while the Jedi (according to Ben Kanobi) claim that only Sith deal in absolutes. Anyone with half of a mind left can see the contradiction in that, and I believe there are more. The release of the DVD/VHS editions will naturally give way to more scrutiny.On the flip side, the entertainment was excellent, and the special effects were top-notch, I'm sure.May the force be with you!"	4.0	Great, but not the best	2005-06-23	3	2	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1AVSW1LXGBO4Y	"Evan Hinton ""Critic for Hire"""	"This is it.  The big one.  The end of a thirty-year franchise that has touched two generations.  Ever since the summer of 1977, ""Star Wars"" has been an unshakable part of our culture.  Its following sequels made movie-goers even more rabid for adventures set in that galaxy far, far away.  But when George Lucas went back to tell the beginning of the story, his prequel films were met with harsh criticism.  But that criticism is about to come to an end.This year's ""Revenge of the Sith"" is the last of these prequels, tying the two trilogies together into an enormous sextet of stories.  And despite rumors to the contrary, it is the final ""Star Wars"" film.  Ever.  The expectations couldn't be higher.  And for once, they're met.After years of fighting the Clone Wars, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and his former mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) have become well-renowned as heroes across the galaxy.  As the film opens, they must rescue the Galactic Republic's Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from the clutches of the Separatist General Grievous (An ominous, computer-generated lightsaber-wielding cyborg, voiced by Matthew Wood).But the film is far more than a simple rescue mission; once that goal has been achieved, Palpatine puts events into motion that will ensure he has even more power, as well as a young, powerful ally in Anakin.  As anyone who hasn't been living under a rock for the last six years can tell you, this film chronicles Anakin's descent into darkness and his transformation into Darth Vader, the epitome of evil for the last thirty years.Perhaps it was the darker, more complex storyline or the fact that Jar Jar Binks has apparently been demoted to ""extra"", but this film feels so much more rewarding than the last two prequels, and acts as the perfect bridge between the new and the old.The first ""Star Wars"" film to earn the PG-13 rating, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is far more graphic and deals with darker ideas than any of the other films, but still doesn't feel out of place.Each film is usually ""carried"" by a particular actor, such as Liam Neeson in ""The Phantom Menace"", where the performance rises above everyone else's.  In this film, that actor is Ian McDiarmid, who is goes from being subtly manipulative to blatantly evil so gracefully that it is very eerie to watch.  Though it is very doubtful he will get an Oscar nod, one can always hope.Being the dramatic climax of Anakin Skywalker's fall to the Dark Side, this movie is actually emotionally draining, going from light and entertaining to dramatic and saddening over the course of its running time.  This film actually made me cry, a first for a ""Star Wars"" film.Despite some slight sagging in the middle as Anakin's relationship to his newly-pregnant wife, Padm&egrave; (Natalie Portman) is clumsily developed, ""Revenge of the Sith"" moves along at nice pace with all the right amounts of action, drama, and humor to please just about anyone."	5.0	"""Revenge of the Sith"": The circle is now complete"	2005-05-19	16	14	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2R54L1BBS5UIQ	ezekielrage_99	This movie was bad and it was just plain stupid like The Matrix sequels. I have always loved episodes 4, 5 and 6 so I was happy when Lucas was making the prequels to the whole star wars saga. Lets face it we all sat through episodes 1 and 2 whilest thinking these movies must be building to something big, and yes it built up to another disappointing star wars franchise.Now where to start with the overall badness of this film.... The Jedi, thanks George for reducing the ultra cool from 4, 5 and 6 to keystone cops, this is no overstatement. The jedi can detect the subtle emotions of creatures in the star wars galaxy but CAN NOT detect an inanely simple plan from the clone troopers and the dark side. How come one jedi can so easily mind control the storm troopers in episode 4, yet a whole army of jedi scattered throughout the galaxy can't mind control the whole of the clone army also scattered throughout the galaxy? If the jedi are really that stupid they all deserved to be destroyed.Do or do not there is no try, sound familiar? Well it should do, it's Yoda's speech from episode 5. How come that little green hypocrit can say this in Empire to Luke but in Revenge of the Sith Yoda has a little bit of a crack at Darth Sidious and then turns in for the day...What about Mace Windu? Mace was one the saving graces of episode 2, the fight scene with Jango Fett showed how cool Mace was. After having words with Dooku Mace jumps from a great height in to the heart of the genosian arena to get medieval on the droid and Jango. What's this? In Revenge of the Sith Mace gets electrocuted and thrown out of a window and dies, from the physics of the previous film Mace should just dust him self off after landing, run back up to Darth Sidious and kill him in true Pulp Fiction style.Now for General Grievous, previously I thought the most fundamentally stupid and subsequently useless CG character ever devised was Jar Jar Binks, we now have a new winner. You could have replaced Grevious with a brick (which would have been cheaper) or write the character out of the movie completely because after all what was the point of Grievous besides putting another star wars toy in the abundant collection for die hard star wars fans to buy? Grievous added nothing to the story.Anakin and Padme made NO SENSE in this film they where both worried about getting caught by the Jedi Council... They shouldn't waste their time on worrying after all the Jedis couldn't work out a simple revenge plan from a sith lord I don't think they could even work out if Padme was pregnant or not with that big fat stomach.When Anakin joins the dark side this was a low point of the whole movie, the dark side was always subtle and ambiguous then in 'Scooby Doo unmasking the villian' fashion Darth Sidious offers Anakin a job in the dark side... STUPID, but not nearly as stupid as the ala Young Frankenstein creation of the more recognisable Darth Vader or the Obi Wan beating evil Anakin so easliy fight.... That was dumb, Obi Wan can't last 2 seconds against Dooku so he has to get Anakin to fight for him HOWEVER we are led to believe that Obi Wan can quiet easily lobb off some arms and legs in true Monty Python and The Holy Grail style (and yes I was laughing when Obi did that to Anakin).I know there will be fans saying but the special effects were great even if you didn't like the plot (and I use the term plot loosely), THERE'S NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT SPECIAL EFFECTS IN EVERY SCENE.THEY ARE JUST EFFECTS, and they weren't that great I've seen better in the Lord of The Rings Trio.Am I too hard on this film, after all this is a children's film right (well according to several Lucas interview)? Nothing says kids flick like the graphic depiction of violence towards children, women, and pretty much anything that breaths. If this is a film for the kids then I going to show a whole heaps of 8 year olds Fight Club and see how impressed there parents would be.But there was one good thing about this moive, Jar Jar was kept to minimum, unfortunately they still didn't kill him. Do yourself a favor watch something decent like Batman Begins, Fight Club or LOTR Triology.	1.0	This was as bad the Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions	2005-06-21	25	17	8
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3JD8FDS3CO3GH	FairiesWearBoots8272	"Star Wars Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is the movie that Star Wars fans have been waiting years, even decades, for. This movie stirs up the geeky excitement that made us all love the series in the first place. After much training and wooing Natalie Portman's Padme, Anakin Skywalker is now ready to unleash his inner Vader. This, my friend, is where things get interesting. If you suffered through the two previous mediocre movies, I think you will find Revenge of the Sith a very satisfying conclusion to the saga.I think the problem with this ""prequel trilogy"" was that George Lucas took about one and a half movies worth of story and stretched it out to THREE two-hour-plus movies. So you had a little bit of story and a whole lot of filler. And most of the filler wasn't very good. Revenge of the Sith is without a doubt the most satisfying and powerful of the three movies, but it suffers the same drawbacks as the other two: lame dialogue and wooden performances. Admittedly, the performances are quite a bit better in Revenge of the Sith. Yes, the movie has its problems, however with a fanboy geek franchise such as this, awesomeness conquers all and Revenge of the Sith has awesomeness to spare. It gets off to a slow start, but things pick up rather quickly.One of the highlights of Revenge of the Sith is Ian McDiarmid's sublime performance as Chancellor Palpatine. As soon as Palpatine reveals his true colors and his evil self emerges, the movie kicks into high gear and doesn't slow down a bit. The movie is at a disadvantage since we already know how it's going to end, so it has to make up for that fact with sheer razzle dazzle, and indeed it does. After the clunky beginning, Revenge of the Sith is exciting and invigorating for nearly all of its running time. We've got Anakin's change to Darth Vader and Palpatine's reveal as the evil Emperor to relish.It seems that with Revenge of the Sith, Lucas tried to go all-out and deliver an awesome Star Wars movie to win back his favor with the fans. No more of the kiddie-pandering of Episode I, this is the darker, more brutal, more violent story that the fans wanted all along. To make up for the sluggish Episodes I and II, Episode III rockets along at hyper speed with nearly nonstop action and excitement. No less than five lightsaber duels, lots of battles and chases, plenty of colorful characters. It's a fitting conclusion to the series, presumably the last to ever grace the movie screen. It answers some questions about the original film trilogy, gives us a deeper understanding of the characters and conflict and brings the story full circle. If you see only one Star Wars prequel, Revenge of the Sith is the one to see."	4.0	The REAL Star Wars Prequel	2005-10-23	7	4	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A19OQ7LWE2YJL3	"F.Faulkner ""F.F."""	A bit too fast moving.  I found it hard to get into the characters and whole story, but it was done well enough that I could enjoy the Chancellor's manipulation of Skywalker.  The acting was much better this time.  Amonst the Jedi, I felt no sense of purpose, brotherhood or closeness which could almost make me think why are they better than anybody else?  Samuel L. Jackson's Windu is a  dislikeable character whom I was glad to see go.  Darth Vadar looks skinny and chicken-breasted - what was up with that?  It's unbelievable that Kenobi doesn't know that Anni & Padme are married or sleeping together even though he's going to visit him at her place all the time, really now.  Where were the mind powers of Kenobi in this film?  Only Jedi Windu & Yoda were using their minds.  And I never in all three movies felt any honest warmth radiating from Kenobi toward Skywalker.  It felt forced for Episode IV.  Ewan MacGregor plays Kenobi coolly- Yoda showed more emotion.  Maybe MacGregor and the actor who plays Skywalker have no chemistry.  I found MacGregor's relationship with Liam Neeson more compelling.The sobbing out of Darth Vadar was corny when he finds out Padme died.  Her death to me was sort of like ho hum she's dead and none of the Jedi really gave a damn that she was dying.I really liked the very end.  Very enjoyable movie, I liked it more than the first two.	4.0	Highly enjoyable!  A few problems... good ending!	2005-05-21	3	1	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2KW2KWKABNYNO	"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We..."	Star Wars 3: Revenge Of The SithThe moment two generations have been waiting for, the movie that answers the simple question, how? How does the chancellor's plan work out, why is he disfigured? How are all but a few Jedi exterminated? How are Luke and Leha born? In addition, how did Anakin turn his soul over to the devil? In addition, many more how's. Nevertheless, the question is does the movie answer these pondering question? Yes, most of them are answered, but smaller ones are not.Obviously, George Lucas had a very hard time connecting the two trilogies, and some stuff does not connect with the other movies, which unfortunately cannot be fixed unless he redid the original trilogies.What about the story, is it as bad as the first two movies? No the other two movies suffered because this is what they were leading up to, if it had been one whole movie it would have been better. Hayden Christenson said this is the part he really wanted to play, not the character in the last movie. The story transitions smoothly, the dialog is a whole lot better, especially the dialog of Obi-Wan when he leaves Anakin in the lava. Why are the dialog and a couple other things in the movie? George got some much-needed help with writing, and it's even rumored that Steven Spielberg did the Yoda, Evil Emperor Fight sequence.Is Anakin's transition believable? Yes, I know that people say that it's impossible, but it's not it happens to regular humans all the time. When you sin, you are moving to a kind of Dark Side.The special effects are excellent; some of the action sequences are stellar.Overall excellent, bad dialog is minimized, childish elements have been eliminated, the story and special effects now stand on their own ground, most everything is tied together, the movie stirs emotions, and the whole thing seems very satisfying, 5/5 Stars.Note: See my three other Unbiased Reviews of Star Wars.Note: The sequel debate is still up, George says he is not going to make any more sequels and prequels to Star Wars, but that does not mean other people can't do it, but to be fair do something new set in a different period, like the Old Republic.	5.0	An Unbiased Review of Star Wars Part 3	2005-11-06	11	6	5

While many fans were disappointed with the stories in Episodes I and II, I think Lucas really hit the nail on the head with this one.  It had a great story line and great effects, and by the end of the movie the tracks are laid for Episode IV, A New Hope.  It was exciting and suspenseful, and even though I knew how it had to end, the path to that end kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.  This was an absolutely phenomenal movie by itself, and the fact that it has five brothers to go with it makes it even better.	5.0	Episode III-Revenge of Lucas	2005-05-19	3	2	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AZ7HIM13RBIAY	"Francisco Llanas ""unfooled"""	"Lucas ruined episodes 4-6. Think about it, don't just be blindly loyal just because you're fanatical about star wars. if you watch these movies in sequential order, you wind up knowing that Luke and Leia are brother and sister before you're supposed to (it was a bigger shocker and a tender moment when you realize this in 'Return of the Jedi,' thanks to episode 3, it ruins this moment. and makes that part when Leia kisses Luke kind of gross in 'The Empire Strikes Back') besides, it also makes Luke's question to Leia about ""HER"" mother completely worthless (""do you remember your mother?"")  What's also ruined is Darth Vader (In so many ways!) when you see Darth Vader for the first time in 'A New Hope,' it's the classic villian introduction, Now, because you see him in 'Revenge of the Sith' it RUINS that scene. I was Hoping beyond all reason that Lucas would have done something to make it SEEM like Anakin and Vader were two different people and continue with the fisade that Vader killed Anakin until 'The Empire Strikes Back.' now, it's no shock, and there's no wonder to what Vader looks like under the mask. That whole scene when Anakin becomes Vader is EXTREMELY Akward and is too corny to believe. Lucas killed Anakin with episodes 1-3. I always imagined Anakin as this awesome uncompromising Jedi who was GRADUALLY seduced by the dark side. Not a whiney teenager who barely realizes his potential, is way too emotional, who suddenly 'switched' in less time it takes to read this review! All based on a dream that his Jedi training (If he was some awesome/powerful Jedi) should have told him that may or may not have been true (and could wind up being a self-fulfilling prophecy) Episodes 1-3 dumb down Darth Vader to a spoiled brat used to getting his way. How dare Lucas shatter the image of Vader as being an intelligent, powerful, and cold villian. I think it's embarrasing that the audience is almost FORCED to feel more intrest and wonder to the side stories rather than the main story they're supposed to be paying attention to! IE: what happens to Obi Wan, Yoda, and Bail Organa.  I stayed till the end to see what happens to them and wound up not caring too much about Anakin and Palpatine. (because I already knew!) If these movies were going to be made, he should have made them 7-9 so that the technology and story would have been something fresh and new, or here's an idea: introduce a completely different story arc that happens to take place in the Star Wars universe. maybe he should have looked at the millions of books that were written about Star Wars and adapted some of them to film. (because seriously, if you read ANY of them, the stories there are WAY better and extremely more imaginitive than what ultimately became episodes 1-3) To all the fan-boys out there who disagree with me on principle alone, open your mind. I'm a huge fan of Star Wars and consider 4-6 three of the best sci-fi movies ever made. Don't be so blind and say ""well the effects were good"" At this point, there should be no ""bad"" effects, and effects are an excuse not to be imaginitive. Use effects to enhance a story like in ""once upon a time in mexico"" (see the documentary on the DVD and you'll see what I mean) not to tell the entire story."	1.0	Shouldn't have made episodes 1-3	2005-06-24	41	27	14

Watching this movie, you think that it would not be a bad idea to do again chapters IV, V and VI. They would be fantastical!What really disappointed me is the story line. I always expected to see an ambitious Anakin. It was horrible that he became to the dark side because of love. Very bad teaching from Mr. George Lucas for our kids! Anakin became the victim of all this history. Only a few moments of glory for this boy, and a lot of tragedies in his life: when he was taken away from his mother, when he could not rescued her of dying, watching Padme dying, giving everything for her, at the end he could not rescued her either, Obi Wan tried to kill him, and not to rescue him, even he was not really killed but even worst, ""just fried"". Lord Vader lost all the courage after this, he became just a marionette. A character without self will.Also the character of Padme did not correspond to the past movies. After being the heroine in many of the battles, she became like a ""dog puppy"" just waiting her master, Anakin, to come back. She never showed any of that strong character to save her husband or even the people she loved. George Lucas confined her as just a ""pregnant woman"" that can not do anything, but staying home combing her hair.At the end my recommendation is to watch the movie because of the excellent effects, and also to complete the story we were all waiting, but do not expect to watch a good story line, not even a regular one."	3.0	Great effects, poor story line	2005-06-10	3	1	2

From the man who brought you ""Howard the Duck,"" this third (or sixth, not counting ""Battle for Endor"") installment in the Star Wars series is not worth its weight in bantha leavings.After watching Hayden C woodenly spewing his scripted cliches, we are left baffled at how this slack-jawed idiot could ever be mistaken for the powerful & menacing Lord Vader.  ""It's not fair"" is his battle-cry, and his only expression is a sort of sickly pouting which is sure to annoy.In short: if you liked Ep.I (""the Phantom Plot"") or episode II (""Attack of the Cloned Plot"") and want more, then dive right in - this is the movie you're looking for.

And, far more than Episodes I, and II, this one captures the pure emotion and wonder that made Episodes IV, V, and VI such huge successes.  The special effects, as always, where excellent!

Anakin's agony is depicted so convincingly that those of us who greeted Darth's transformation back to good in ""Return of the Jedi"" with skepticism now have no doubts. As he did in ""The Empire Strikes Back"", George Lucas manages to give us special effects that are, well, spectacular without letting the storyline suffer in the slightest.Ian McDiarmid gives a stunning and underrated performance as Palpatine, as does Samuel L. Jackson's swashbuckling portrayal of Mace Windu. ""Revenge of the Sith"", despite the aforementioned strained dialogue, still has a depth missing in other segments of the ""Star Wars"" saga and is a more than worthy conclusion to this fabulous saga.

It is better than the prior two episodes, but that's not really a compliment.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ANMFFCVZ3KM81	"F. Williams ""TheFarisReel on Facebook"""	"(Star Wars - Episode III)  George Lucas has put his crowning touch on this quintessential ""pas de la resistance"" finale.  With cinematic grandeur that only Lucas could achieve, this ending saga quite eloquently weaves continuity into all the loose ends of the five prior epilogues.The battle sequences are exquisite with saber swords blazing; whether matted before mountain fortitude or cascading lava flow.  The audience is slowly manipulated through the ominous sequences and events which lead to Anakin Skywalkers lure to the dark side of the Force.  Though I have serious reservations if that exact reasoning used in the film to trigger the turn to the dark side was indeed strong enough to do so; however, we all knew that Anakin's turn to the dark side was inevitable.As in all of Lucas' films, the CGI effects are seamless and highly effective in whisking us into a galaxy far, far away.  The film's focus was tri-fold. First, was Chancellor Palpatine's rise in the Senate and his continued stronghold over young Skywalker.  Second, was Anakin's lost of faith with the Jedi counsel and his lure to the dark side; and third, was the rise to power of Darth Vader, and the annihilation of the Jedi warriors.Again, I have nothing but accolades for this sixth and final episode.  The apprehension regarding the ""darkness"" of the theme of this film was highly over exaggerated.  As a matter of fact, except for one very disturbing scene where ""newly turned"" Anakin encounters some ""youngling"" Jedi's, everything else in the film is very palatable.  The funny thing about the ""youngling"" sequence is it's implied rather than shown on the screen, and a scene in which (I felt) was more apt to occur at the hands of the evil Emperor, than a newly turned Darth Vader.  (Just my opinion).Sit back and enjoy.

That should be reason enough not to pay attention to them.  Second, pertaining to the bad reviews since its release, what the heck were people expecting??  This is Star Wars.  It's always been about over-the-top special effects, bad dialogue and comic book-type action.  We all know that George Lucas can't write a script (or direct) to save his life.  Knowing that all six films are of this caliber, we can all just overlook that and enjoy the film.And what a film it is!  The darkness of this movie is beyond what anyone would expect.  Lucas wrote a heck of a story (while he can't write dialogue, he can certainly come up with a great story).  It certainly surpasses Episode V (Empire) as a dark chapter where the bad guys win.  Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader happens a bit too fast, but Vader's evil is depicted in the most shocking and vile manner.  A very welcome aspect of Star Wars that was never done before.  True, Padme has little to do with this film, but the story is no longer about her at this point.  Yoda surprises by being so damn cool!  The end of the Vader/Obi-Wan fight came off way better than I thought, almost brought tears to my eyes.Surprisingly, he covers all bases to tie it into the next trilogy.  C3PO's memory is erased (which I thought Lucas would overlook), Yoda and Obi-Wan go into exile, Obi-Wan even takes Anakin's lightsaber (which he later gives Luke).  It shows why Darth Vader doesn't know about Luke until between episodes 4 and 5 as well.At 2.5 hours, it's the longest of the films, but you will not be disappointed with it.  This movie is by far and away exactly what Star Wars fans have been waiting for.  It almost makes you want Lucas to completely re-shoot the next three films so they'll look as cool as this one does.Lots of other reviewers seem to need a bit of info in order to quell their complaints:- In Episode VI, Leia talks about Padme.  In no way does she say she remembers her, she remembers only feelings.  I imagine this in the same way she ""felt"" Luke in Episode V while he was hanging from the Cloud City.  So Padme dying during childbirth is not an inconsistency from the storyline.- General Greivous coughs because he's not fully a robot.  He's a cyborg, which you should know by the end of his fight with Obi-Wan.I believe the only inconsistency in the story line is the blatant, flat-out oddity of Qui-Gon being Obi-Wan's Jedi instructor, when it was revealed in Episode V that Yoda instructed Obi-Wan.I'm sure that anyone reading this will go see the movie anyway.  It's gonna be a huge blockbuster hit...much more so than anyone expects."	5.0	Best of the prequels, maybe even of the series!	2005-05-20	6	5	1

Upon learning that his wife, Padm&eacute; (Natalie Portman) is pregnant, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) fears that she may die in child birth.  Pressured by the Jedi Council, Anakin becomes a prime target for the sinister Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) and his dark teachings.  As Anakin is seduced into joining the Dark Side of the Force, the Jedi Order crumbles and the galaxy falls under the iron-grip of an evil Emperor.After the somewhat disappointing first two entries of Lucas's new ""Star Wars"" trilogy, I was worried that ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" would follow the same path and prove to be a letdown. I tried to remain optimistic since this was the final entry in the saga and the very nature of the events which would inevitably transpire on screen might allow for an exceptional film. On the evening of May 18th, as I impatiently waited for the eminent midnight screening, my enthusiasm and excitement matched that of a small child on Christmas Eve. A few hours later, I had finally seen ""Revenge of the Sith"". I can thankfully say that it was, in fact, very much like revisiting my childhood. There were moments during the screening where I could not help but stare in wide-eyed amazement at the screen, raise up my hands and clap, or murmur excitedly to my friend seated next to me.Like most of the ""Star Wars"" films, ""Sith"" suffers from some clunky lines of dialogue, which include, ""From my point of view, the Jedi are evil"" and ""You're so beautiful...It's because I love you"". However, such poorly written lines of dialogue are few and far between when compared to a film like ""Attack of the Clones"". Lucas' strength as a writer has always been crafting a good story, and he has set himself up for quite a story to tell! ""Episode III"" inescapably culminates with such drama and tragedy and is presented with such captivating visuals and riveting action that I didn't particularly mind a few moments of poor dialogue.Another integral factor in lessening the blandness of the dialogue is the film's markedly improved performances. Ewan McGregor does a splendid job at channeling Alec Guinness, the British actor who originated the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original ""Star Wars"". McGregor seems comfortable in the ""Star Wars"" universe. Finally breaking free of the woodenness that plagued his performances in the previous two films, McGregor's emotional output at the conclusion of his duel with Darth Vader is truly moving. Ian McDiarmid, portraying Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, is also worthy of special mention as he seduces Anakin to the Dark Side with subtlety and menace. Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman, while still occasionally stiff and uncomfortable with some of their ham-fisted dialogue, have developed a nice bit of chemistry. The two share a moment, a wordless exchange prior to Anakin's descent into darkness that is beautifully acted, scored, and edited and not only enhances their relationship but offers a great sense of foreboding. Frank Oz rounds out the cast with his as-always incomparable vocal interpretation of Jedi Master Yoda.All the production departments have substantially raised the bar for ""Episode III"". Stylistically, the film is very different from most other ""Star Wars"" films. Resembling ""The Empire Strikes Back"", Lucas' cinematographer bathes the characters in shadow, illuminating their eminent fates and the tragedy of the story. John Williams has composed yet another unforgettable musical score that ranges from operatic to ominously atmospheric. The meandering and tasteless political dialogue of the previous two films has been excised, allowing ""Revenge of the Sith"" to move at a break-neck pace which imparts a sense of urgency and events spiraling out of control. With many plot threads going on simultaneously, the film left me feeling breathless without coming across as rushed or disorganized. Finally, you can't talk about ""Star Wars"" without mentioning its visual effects. ""Revenge of Sith"" boasts an unprecedented volume of computer generated imagery. The highlight of the special effects work is perhaps the opening space battle which is both visually and sonically arresting. Entire shots are composed completely within the computer. While Lucas occasionally goes overboard and loses focus in the midst of such CGI-mayhem, the effects work on this film has greatly improved upon the work done in ""Episode I"" and ""Episode II"". Computer generated Yoda is particularly strong as the character has understated yet clear emotional responses to the events going on around him.The joy in watching ""Revenge of the Sith"" comes from over 20 years of waiting and anticipating how the saga will draw to a close. There are so many hallmark moments in this film that fans know must happen. Audiences know that all the Jedi must die and that Anakin will fall from grace and become Darth Vader. One might argue that such knowledge would sap the film of any potential tension. On the contrary, the realization of these scenes elevates the film to something of a modern Greek tragedy. When watching ""Revenge of the Sith"", one can see fate at work.After having seen ""Revenge of the Sith"", I don't think I can ever look at the original trilogy the same way again. Vader's already substantial character has been given far more depth and the trilogy, as whole, now contains far more emotional resonance. Small, seemingly unimportant lines such as Yoda's line in ""Return of the Jedi"", ""Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor,"" have been given far more weight and significance. ""Revenge of the Sith"" advances the entire saga, not just Lucas's original trilogy. The admittedly grating depiction of juvenile Anakin in ""Episode I"" will now come off as a stark and poignant contrast after having seen what becomes of the small boy from Tatooine.As the credits began to roll at the conclusion of ""Episode III"", I had never felt so simultaneously exhilarated and depressed at the end of a film. The best thing I can say about ""Sith"" is that, despite the great deal of enjoyment I have taken from the original trilogy, I did not want the inevitable events of this chapter to transpire. I wanted so much for Anakin to make the right decisions. Arousing such emotions and turmoil within an audience takes a great deal of care and balance. Bravo, George! A job well done!"	4.0	Embracing the Dark Side never felt so good!	2005-05-26	12	10	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A6A3JB1GAAD3M	Garridon	It was such a great opportunity to tie up the films and end with a big bang.  Instead, it goes out with a film that just doesn't work.  Here we have Anakin, who is about to become one of the most evil people in the universe and will kill probably thousands of people as Darth Vader.  Why?  What would push a man into becoming that way?  The movie offers very superficial reasons that fail to justify why.  It's like the reasons were just tossed out carelessly so that the movie could get at the ultimate goal, getting the Darth Vader suit on.It really is a shame because it could have been a fantastic movie, and it just didn't work.	1.0	20 year wait for this?	2005-11-25	28	18	10

Star Wars, the one that everybody is waiting for. This was the worst movie i have seen all year. Such poor acting; they did a half a'ed job. The action wasn't complete at all. The action scenes were so lame. The script could have been written by a 10 year old. The best thing about most movies is the script, the dialogue, it should flow and not be awkward by saying only what had to be said like I have to go! It's the only way! or something like that. It's a million miles away from being in the ballpark of say, Lord of the Rings or something else with actual effort. I don't think George Lucas was even interested as he made this movie. I don't suggest this film to anyone. If you want to see it just because everyone else is be my guest. Hey! I saw it so it doesn't matter just a waste of money in my opinion. The way this sad sad world is, one person does it we all have to. The ending was corny no surprises. Not that they're could be. Nothing new happens nothing revealed. The aliens weren't cool looking and there was nothing unique about any of them. The light sabers fights were lame and so was the volcano place. It's just not my kind of movie. I hope I'm not completely alone on this one.	1.0	What a reck. At least its done.	2005-07-05	23	10	13
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A396KEHKOHBB49	G. Avina	The first star wars trilogy had less special affects and is way better than the new trilogy, which has all the special affects money can buy.  What's up with that?  The acting/dialogue was horrible; its obvious that Lucas tried to make that up with all the fancy computerized scenes in the movie.  They picked the wrong actors to play Anakin and Padme.  I had to buy the spanish dubbed VHS of Attack of the Clones because i couldnt stand Hayden's acting.  The only thing good about Episode III is the scene where Darth Vader is introduced.  I pray that the TV series is worth watching.	2.0	Better than the first two, but still missing something.	2005-11-01	10	4	6
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1QCLVHREHFV8U	Geese Howard 4 Life	"When I saw the first three movies I knew it was models and the like used for the ships, but it was a good story. For whatever reason the actors and actresses gave life to the roles that they were given and for that reason alone Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi pushed sci-fi beyond the B-movie mania of too many films that I could type here... but...It was clear in Return of the Jedi that George Lucas had hit some sort of wall. Return of the Jedi was lackluster compared to Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back and I left the movie theater with my best friend telling me; ""Looks like he just wanted to wrap it up and be done with it.""My case in point is Boba Fett.Supposedly he wore the armor of some group called the Mandalorians and his ""fearless efficiency"" in The Empire Strikes Back made him a great supporting character that is widely known by fans and non-fans of Star Wars. The character is one that clearly deserved better than to eventually be revealed to be a clone of a man who lacked enough sense to stay out of a battle that he wasn't being paid to fight in.The revelation that Boba Fett was not some highly trained survivor of one of the factions that was supposedly involved in the war that caused the Republic to fall, but was actually a clone, (a CLONE!) did exactly what all three of these ""prequeals"" did for the entire Star Wars Trilogy.It cheapened it.Clones, ordered by who knows who per Episode II, but of course we know it was the suspicious guy named Palpatine, but we should ignore the fact that this guy is creepier looking without the cloak and hood. We should vote said creepy and downright evil looking man, we should make him universal omnipotent ruler on the word of a creature as wretched as Jar Jar Binks who somehow was made someone who should even be NEAR any important decision... and people who say this movie was good miss this? I say again, how can anyone call any of these movies good when it is Jar Jar Binks that propels Palpatine to Supreme Chancellor in Episode II while Amidala is away.If Lucas was trying to make any political points in Episode III, then he is as clueless as the people he's aiming at (it's like a GI Joe episode... lotta bullets flyin and nobodies dyin, nobodies hit). Palpatine gained absolute authority thanks to the irresponsibility of Amidala leaving Jar Jar Binks, I say again JAR JAR BINKS, as her rep with the Senate. So any talk of how ""democracy dies"" is just someone trying to cover there tracks to make up for the fact that THEY KILLED IT.Anyway, the clones are pressed into service, but if we were even partially awake for any of the actual Star Wars movies one would have to miss the fact that clones are not individuals and probably violate some sort of ""basic rule of life"" under some Jedi code somewhere. It's probably been hidden by ""the younglings."" When I heard that in Episode II I thought it was the National Arbor Day, Plant a Tree FESTIVAL!So now in Episode III, since Lucas has chosen to ignore what he has already laid down some sort of ground rule for in his early work. The Jedi now FAITHFULLY and FLAWLESSLY ACCEPT clones that Obi-wan was already told had limited free thought and absolute loyalty, but they don't know who the person is that ordered AND paid for them!Even if I WAS A ""YOUNGLING"" I couldn't place my trust in something like that! The story is just sooo far fetched in Episode III that unless I totally shut down ANY rational thought of a plot or storyline and just oooo-and-ahhh at the blaring noises and special effects, and why did he make things seem MORE ADVANCED HERE than in his original movies? The stormtroopers look 10X's BETTER in Episode III than in the original movies, but ironically since they are all CGI it's like watching a Final Fantasy MOVIE because you can see the fact that they are NOT real actors in real costumes.Younglings? After that I need a Yuengling so I can be drunk enough to ignore the total lack of writing and creativity AND thank GOD that these three movies were REJECTED in favor of the three that most know of... for once movie execs did us all a favor!With that now said; Were the Stormtroopers in the original Star Wars all clones and if so? How in God's name could they have been so awful in Star Wars and Return of the Jedi if they came from Jango Fett who killed at least one Jedi before being dumb enough to press his luck and lose his head?Adding to this is the fact that in Episode III a simple Code 66 is given and the Jedi are gunned down like the old nintendo game of ""Duck Hunt."" I was waiting for Car 66! Or Route 66! The entire prequel saga seemed like the continuation of George Lucas' lackluster Return of the Jedi, but let's remember that Mace Windu suspects Palpatine and is even concerned about Anakin and his loyalty yet when he has Palpatine down he tries to ""talk with Anakin"" who is eventually bested by a lackluster Obi-Wan by movies end?And I just got an email from lackluster. It wants no further part in my review since it's been ages since someone has used the word so much!Revenge of the Sith had the consistency of day old GRITS! And if you know what that is, then you know, ""it ain't good!""The ""Journey to the Darkside"" by Anakin is so poorly done thanks to Hayden, and Natalie Portman was just ""along for the ride"" in this movie. Nevermind the cheap ""Frankenstein's Monster"" impersonation when Vader gets off the table after learning of Padme's death. I expected that Vader would lash out at Palpatine since Palpatine was supposed to protect her. This would have shown ""the power of the Darkside"" if Palpatine was cast as the Snake in the Garden of Eden and had to use a combination of his power AND persuasion to stop a crazed Vader, but instead we are treated to what seems like a bad game of Simon Says and none of the things that could have OR should have happened take place.Sith is barely better than the other two prequels, but the fact that Obi-Wan in Star Wars has NO IDEA of who R2 is and C-3PO, a notorious LOUDMOUTH, never says a thing to Obi-Wan in Star Wars about EVER MEETING HIM! There are too many attempts to force things together instead of blending them correctly and I don't appreciate Lucas trying to use his cartoon to explain General Grevious' breathing problems! The whole thing is just one giant scam after another in what looks like a blatant attempt to line HIS pocket with ""credits"" while putting out a movie that a bunch of high schoolers could have written and starred in (no offense to high schoolers as this movie is only given two stars by me out of sheer sympathy for what sould have been and will now never be).Mind you, without being a stickler for detail (I'm probably too late for that), Episode II brings the Clones to the forefront, but I don't believe that anyone was comissioned to build the fleet of ships or vehicles that were used and if Lucas is saying that when we saw the Kamino factory in Episode II with the clones marching around that these people built the fleet too... I think the Kamino, they would have been a helluva lot more interesting to showcase then the useless characters and subplots that he went with.Oh and one last thing. A friend of mine who is a casual fan of Star Wars saw Episode III and he called me afterwards. He said something funny; Why didn't any of the ""Jedi Masters"" realize that if Anakin was the one to bring balance to the force that it could LITERALLY mean just that? Balance by way of killing off the far larger number of Lightside Jedi, in comparison to the limited number of Darkside Jedi. By Star Wars ""A New Hope"" there is only The Emperor and Vader of the Darkside and Yoda and Obi-Wan for the Lightside.I told him...

Revenge of the Sith, the final movie, will blow everyone away!  From what I have heard of this movie, I have no doubt of this.  It will feature the largest space battle in the entire saga, 5 epic lightsaber battles including Yoda vs Darth Sidious, Obi-Wan vs Grievous, Anakin vs Dooku, Mace Windu, Kit Fisto, and two Jedi Masters vs Palpatine and Anakin, and finally, Obi-Wan vs Anakin!  Also, it concentrates on Anakin's chilling and stunning fall to the Dark Side and the death of Padme at his hand!  It also includes tons of new things, like a massive Clone Wars battle on Kashyyyk, where Yoda battles the Separatists alongside wookies, including Chewbacca and a sad scene where Anakin goes into the Jedi Temple and kills everyone there including the Jedi children!  It is confirmed that Anakin's red and yellow eyes will be in the film and that, although Vader will be in Revenge of the Sith for 2-5 minutes, he will leave an impact on the fans.  I dont know about you, but this movie is gonan blow my world away and if George Lucas ever had a shining point in his star wars saga, it is now.  He is making this movie so good it will surpass the greatness of the breathtaking Attack of the Clones.  I mean, two large-scale Clone Wars battles and 5 epic lightsaber battles is enough to make me wanna see it and just think, there is more in Revenge of the Sith than that!This movie is so great.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ANBQIWHO9JRFS	General Zombie	"This movie shows the danger of listening to what other people have to say about a film, particularly a major release. There was so much, and such varied pre-release discussion of this film that I didn't really know what to expect, though my hopes were not high. Walking out of the theater, I realized that this movie was exactly what I would've imagined it would be after seeing Episode II. Much like Episode II, 'Revenge of the Sith' isn't boring, but it's pretty damn lame. Virtually everyone proclaims this one the best of the prequels, but I actually think Episode II is marginally better. It has less action, but the final fight there is way better than anything here, and the talky stuff is a lot funnier. A few general thoughts--The acting was indeed terrible. Each and every lead actor was horrific. Some have claimed that the acting was good considering the wretched, laughable script. Balls. Total balls, man. They *couldn't* have done much with the script they had, but as it is they did nothing. The worst offender is, of course, Hayden Christensen.(SP? don't much care) The fault isn't entirely his own: He's horribly miscast. He's too much of a wussy pretty boy. He tries to put on his most menacing pouty-face throughout the latter portions of the film, but he just comes across as a sissy. This film couldn't have with him as Anakin. Period. Fortunately, Lucas made sure it wouldn't have worked anyway.-Though this film was pretty action-packed, much of it was lame. The fight inside the ship towards the beginning is pretty cool, but the space-fight preceding it is wretched, and the final saber battle is utterly uninspired. Sorry, but having them do it in a lava flow is just stupid. And the stuff with the lizard and General Grievous. Ugh, don't wanna get into it.-The plot was terrible, and character motivation really unlikely. What it comes down to, is that Anakin was more or less tricked into becoming evil. If there's a less satisfying way for him to become Vader, I can't imagine it. That and it's not remotely convincing: The senate and other Jedi's are corrupt, therefore I will slaughter the innocent children. Sure, there could've been a progression from one place to the other, but we didn't see it in the film. He just went directly from being a loose cannon to being..... PURE EVIL!!!!!!!!!!!! MUWUHAHAHAHAHHA!!!!!!!-General Grievous: What the HELL?!?-Another Yoda fight. I'll admit it, it was pretty funny the first time.  But, it's totally worthless w/o the novelty factor.-Younglings? hahahaha!!!-It's just all so random, visually speaking. Lucas seems so excited by all the random, stupid crap that CGI allows him to do that he insists on doing it all no matter whether or not it's cool or dramatically relevant. Just because you can animate a stupid giant lizard doesn't mean you should.-He mentioned mitichlorians again. Thought those had been stricken from the record. They ought've been.-Stupid, shallow references to the latter films. CHEWY'S IN IT. OMFG!!!!!!! EEP!!! DERE'S THE DEF STAR!!!!-""Love can't save you. Only my new powers can."" Other lines have stolen the spotlight, but that is, in fact, the worst line in the series.(...)You've gotta be frickin' kidding me. How anyone could not laugh out loud at that is beyond me.Yeah, that's it. This movie is not a return to the old stuff, it's just another stupid, childish prequel in spite of it's superficial darkness. (And I'm not some raving original trilogy fan. I like them, but they're hardly amongst my favorite films.) It's rarely, if ever boring, but lotsa crappy movie are entertaining.Grade: D+"	2.0	Just another prequel... 5/10	2005-07-13	43	22	21

Be prepared, though, for some seriously bad performances.  The writing and acting are so bad, it's almost funny.  Almost.  More often, it just kind of turns your stomach.Special effects are good, but actually not as good as you might be expecting.  Palpatine's transformation to the deformed Emperor is especially disappointing.  A few times the old magic seems to be there--but then one of the actors opens his or her mouth, and it's all ruined.Bottom line: go to see how it all fits together, but don't go with high or even moderate expectations.	2.0	Worst writing, acting and directing ever	2005-05-20	11	2	9
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A26IVJJTXOE85B	Georgio Alfani	"HEY! YOU DON'T SAY A REVIEW ISN'T HELPFUL BECAUSE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THE OPINION EXPRESSED! GET A LIFE!Revenge of the Sith is my second favorite Star Wars film in the saga behind ""The Empire Strikes Back."" I really like how the acting is a huge step up from  ""Attack of the Clones."" The screenplay is also a hundred times better. Our characters finally have something to do!! This is the moment we've all been waiting for all these years and the movie really lives up to my expectations. This movie is serious and really earns it's PG13 rating.The actor that plays the Emperor really gives an excellent performance in manipulating Anakin into the dark side. Every one stepped their game up as far as acting and the battle scenes were spectacular. The screenplay is also the best out of the new trilogy easily. This film is ESSENTIAL to watch, even with the old trilogy. you can't get the complete star wars expeireance without watching this film. Forget the other 2. watch this film right after ""empire strikes back"" and then after watching it jump right into ""return of the Jedi."" IT FEELS RIGHT! This is the only prequel film that helps push the story forward from the original trilogy. The actor that plays Anakin does a better job this time around than in ""Attack of the Clones."" This is how I want to remember Anakin; as a troubled adult!Revenge of the sith has emotion. This is what episode 2 & 3 were missing. The emotional resonance in revenge of the sith mirrors the emotion that was so prevalent in the original trilogy. We feel anakin's struggle because the way the plot is written makes distinguishing who is wrong and right not so easy. I love the way the Jedi are cleverly portrayed as dogmatic and narrow minded. The way they try to decieve the chancellor is a great plot device to help confuse Anakin and seduce him to the dark side. Hayden Christenesen's portrayl of Anakin this time around is not centered on his resistance to Obi's training or desire to be with padme but around his loyalty to the Jedi. The way Anakin's love for Padme is used against him exihibits the attributes of a Shakespearean tragedy. I love it and it help's create empathy for Vader, which ties in perfectly with Return of the Jedi.I also like the lack of comedy in this film, which is a very brief moment with R2 in the very beginning. The film utilizes its time by focusing 100% on Anakin'd decent into the darkside. The beauty of this film is also that you don't have to watch episode 2 to understand, which is an attribute of a great sequel. The addition of the character General Grieveous was awesome too. He is the best new character in the prequels and far more menacing than Darth Maul and the underdeveloped count dooku, who ends up to be merely a plot device for Anakin's decent into the dark side. So much was insignificant in episodes 1 and 2 but here we finally have emotions that contribute to the original trilogy. Some people complain about Padme's death because it was of a broken  heart but for me that is clear mythology. Why believe that a child can be born from a virgin but that someone can't die from a broken heart? People let this bother them too much. Some people also point out that in return of the jedi Leia recalls memories of her mother, indicating a continuity error but how would she know if it is here real mother or not? Of course we know it's not her mother but does she? In other words is she recalling memories of Senator Organa's wife, her foster mother? It's trivial and people shouldn't let this bother them. Some people also complain about Vader's cry of ""No!"" saying it was done poorly but my assessment is that it's edited to the next scene at a fast pace and people wanted more time. They wanted him to fall to his knees, crying, and pleaing for self forgivness, people need to remember this is star wars not lord of the rings. There was a scene in the empire strikes back that was similar. When Yoda utters ""there is another"" it quickly cuts to the next scene. I too was like ""wait a minute. Let it resonate."" but that's star wars and the point I'm trying to make is that it doesn't ruin the film in the slightest bit.I don't care what anyone says this movie is the perfect Star Wars film and a great companion to the old trilogy.

Yes, the Anaking / Padme love story was pretty lame but the last hour of Episode II (from the moment they reach Genosis) is a complete knockout. As for the last episode of this trilogy, Lucas manages to leave you drained out from the emotion of things you pretty much new where going to happen anyway, which is quite an acomplishment.Perhaps time will bring this trilogy a little justice, for some of us, the complete six episode saga will always be there to enjoy.	5.0	FANTASTIC !	2006-02-06	5	3	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ALZ5Y1CE0DWQ1	G. Guberlal	"To be honest, I had great expectations for ""Revenge of the Sith"". However, nothing in my imagination or wildest dreams could have come close to the power of this movie. Star Wars fans, and casual fans alike will explore the Dark Side like never before. My expectations were greatly exceeded.When the film opens and the tears of joy/sadness that this is the last Star Wars film -reportedly- has faded with the roll up introduction so common to us, will we see a film that is breathtaking. From the opening sequence dogfight to save Chancellor Palpatine from the clutches of General Grievous to the last moment of the film, which directly ties it to Episode IV, you cannot leave your seat.In the beginning of the film, Anakin and General Obi-Wan Kenobi (yes, it seems some time has passed since Episode II, although it is never said how long) are like brothers bound to each other and their duties. In that way, it distances itself from the rebellious youth portrayed in Episode II. Obi-Wan and Anakin board General Grievous's ship to rescue Palpatine who is being held captive by Count Dooku. Even in this early onset of the movie, when securing Palpatine, there is a conflict in Anakin. In hindsight of later events, the conflict seems timid in comparison, yet it is there nonetheless. I don't want to spoil this part of the movie for the people who haven't seen it, however, there is a choice to be made: Serve Palpatine's wishes, save Obi-Wan...or both. George Lucas certainly put a lot of thought into this scene which defines the rest of the movie and that of mindset of young Skywalker.What ensues over the course of 2 hours and 17 minutes is the darkest, most twisted, violent, brutal and emotional Star Wars I have ever seen. Lucas takes us so far into the Dark Side as he had the good with Luke, it can be summed up as extremism. That certainly is a good thing - a very good thing.Aside from standard babbling about how good the special effects are and the Lightsaber battles (the best I've ever seen), I wanted to focus of the story itself. Trust me, the cinematics are light years beyond your imagination.I wouldn't bring very young children to see this movie because there is a reason for its PG-13 rating. The story is dark, extremely, as I mentioned before and very disturbing - especially the last hour. The dialogue may not be, as all critics are pointing out despite the ""Two Thumbs Up & 3.5 Star ratings, up there with the great writers of all-time. Did it have to be? No. This tale is told by the actors body language and the scenarios in which they were placed.We all know Anakin becomes Darth Vader and so on, yet his transformation is told is such a powerful, menacing, and highly disturbing way, that even the toughest cynics have to be impressed.In my slew here of adjectives, let me add gruesome. From the final battle with Obi-Wan, it is not a pretty sight being converted from Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader.I didn't want to make this a walkthrough of the movie, nor give away its spoilers (oddly enough, I didn't expect to learn anything new, but I did), so I tried to sum it up in a way that captured the films essence. It is the turn to the Dark Side and indeed, it is the most exhilirating, disturbing, emotional, gruesome, etc... journey I have witnessed.

Although it was pretty kool to see the four lightsaber wielding. I really wish they had spent more time developing Darth Maul but the storyline doesnt allow it since you cant have 3 apprentices. it wouldve been kool if he had come back as some sort of rogue sith lord and never had grevious. But after that the movie is pure bliss. (Spoilers) After you watch the Jedi die and the switch between the 2 climatic battles of Yoda vs. Sidious and Obi vs. Anakin you will be in complete awe. And about Vader not being evil lets not forget he blew up an entire planet and had his own daughter totured in a new hope doesnt get more evil than that. And unlike the second one Hayden gives a better performance here and Ewan is spot on as Obi Wan. Makes you wish the first 2 were never made and after watching this you want more Star Wars. perhaps some sequels following the 6 episode or an episode 4.

The first two prequles were an obvious dissapointment, but I think Lucas redeemed himself with this one. Of course, there will still be the naysayers, but if you were ever a Star Wars fan I would recommend this one. Some of the acting is poor, and the script can be cheesy at points, but let's not forget that this is true of the originals in some respects. It is fair to say that the original cast had a chemistry that it's quite impossible to reproduce, but what can you expect. I like this one more than Return of the Jedi, personally, wirth Empire as the obvious best film of the entire series. For any fan, finally seeing the events that led to the original trilogy is a thrill and it all ties together beautifully. There are things I finally understand about the original trilogy that never made sense to me. How Obi-Wan keeps appearing to Luke as some kind of apparition, for instance. Watching the events that turned Anakin to the dark side is well worth your time.	4.0	To sum it up	2005-10-18	0	0	0

Maudlin. Wooden. Clumsy. It's clear that, aside from cheap nostalgia and a romanticized looking-back to the earlier films, Lucas has lost his way. Audiences who cheer this final film and rave that it's a fitting end to the series and ""the best ever"" are seriously deluded.  Did they watch the same product..er...um...film? Can he even direct a quality film ever again?  This is the hapless final product of someone who has sadly surrounded himself with ""Yes Men"" who are only too eager to validate his every whim.  Full of horribly over-acted performances, cluttered CGI effects, and a thoroughly amateurish script, this is a horrible way to end what many view as the greatest epic series of all time.  Lucas even botched the final transition/reveal of the future Darth Vader - it's so clunky and anti-climactic, you can only wince and try to remember way back in 1977 how the original ""Star Wars"" enchanted audiences."	1.0	Overhyped Ending to Sci-Fi Sextet	2005-11-03	29	20	9

Maybe it was Alec Guiness and Harrison Ford that carried the first movie. And I must say even Mark Hammill was excellent in Episode IV. I just didn't care about the ""Jedis"" who turned out to be boring intergalactic narcs.The special effects are great, but what movie doesn't have great FX these days? How hard would it have been to make Anakin REALLY BELIEVABLY EVIL?The first two ""prequels"" could easily have been condensed into about ten minutes of flashback. Whoever played Obi Wan Kenobi is certainly not going to become any sort of Alec Guiness caliber actor. The whole thing was weak.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3PSEPQX80AUDU	"GP ""PP"""	"*Contains Spoilers*In my review for Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace I wrote how the light and bright Phantom reflected the time in which it was released. 1999 was the dawn of the new Millennium and hope and freshness abounded during what was something of a short golden age for Western Society. If The Phantom Menace was a movie for its time, then 2005's dark and desperate Revenge of the Sith was also a movie of its time and for today. As the world stands on the edge of global despression and we continue with uncertain wars and the face the prospect of ever more sophisticated and outrageous terrorism many of us are feeling a sense of despair - Revenge of the Sith reflects that sense of despair and unease really quite profoundly. This film transends the Star Wars myth and becomes tome for today.The story of ""Revenge"" is basically Anakin Skywalker turning to the dark side and embracing his destiny - Darth Vader. However, this film actually belongs to The Emperor, aka Darth Sidious, aka Palpatine. Its Ian Mcdiarmids outstanding performance of Palpatine that is the glue that holds the film together. As Paplatines plot finally falls into place and we understand at last just who The Phantom Menace is, Mcdiarmid totally eats up the screen. From the early scenes where Palpatine subtlely sucks the unsuspecting Anakin into his dastardly plot (look out for a particularly stunning scene between Anakin and Palpatine early in the movie, where Palpatine relays the legend of the tragedy of ""Darth Plagueis The Wise"" to Anakin. This is possibly the best acted scene in ANY of the six movie Saga) through to the hackling, insane and unbelievably evil Emperor literally trashing democracy itself as he battles Yoda in The Senate, this is Mcdiarmids movie and does he rise to the occasion! This is surely the best Star Wars performance since Guiness in Star Wars and Ford in Empire Strikes Back.However, ALL the acting performances are better in this film. Natalie Portman, Hayden Christenson and Sam Jackson deliver much more solid work than they did in Attack of the Clones. Ewan Mcgregor, if not quite as good as in Clones, is still excellent. The actors clearly relish have more dramatic material to work with, and aside from the occasional poor line here and dodgy acting there, everyones work rises to a better standard in this film.The film starts with an epic space battle as The Clone Wars reaches its final cresendo. Palpatine has set up his kidnapping and Anakin (now a Jedi Knight) and Obi-Wan Kenobi stage a desperate bid to rescue him from the clutches of Darth Tyrannus (Christopher Lee) and new villain General Grevious. The first twenty minutes is non stop, classic Star Wars action. Look out for the shocking moment when Tyrannus is executed at the hands of Anakin. - This is the first indication of just how dark Revenge of the Sith is.The film for me really picks up after the opening action when Anakin returns to Coruscant and is reunited with his wife Padme. He finds out he is to be a father and its at this point he begins to have visions of Padmes death - Which takes us back to his mothers death in Attack of the Clones. This sets Anakin on a journey to stop Padme from dying as his mother did. A journey that sees him selling his soul to the devil and desending litterally into hell. For the knowlage to save Padme Anakin must betray his Jedi comrades and become Sith Lord Darth Vader.The middle of the film, where Anakin makes his choice to turn to the dark side, is where Revenge of the Sith lifts from just being a good Star Wars film to being a great film in its own right. A slient moment of rumination between Anakin and Padme offers one of the most haunting moments in Star Wars history. As Anakin and Padme connect silently across the bustling cityscape on Coruscant, a silent voice wails in pain. The sun sets on the galaxy and on our doomed lovers and Anakin makes his decision.The rest of the film sees the destruction of the Jedi and Anakins appalling betrayal. A pivitol scene between Anakin, Palpatine (now transformed into the warped Emperor we knew from Return of the Jedi) and Mace Windu is really the key scene to understanding just how deep Anakins betrayal was and that he was given the chance to do the right thing, but made the wrong choice - Leading to the quite shocking death of Mace.The final part of the movie is where all the loose ends are tied up. From Palpatine becoming Emperor of the Galactic Empire through to the end of the Clone Wars, through to the mythic and long awaited lightsaber fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan against the volcanic, hellish backdrop of Mustafar, through to the birth of Padmes children, Luke and Leia and the death/birth of Padme/Anakin/Darth Vader, Revenge of the Sith delivers in spades.The shocking irony of Anakin himself making his nightmares come true and lashing out at the woman he turned to the dark side to save  takes ""Revenge"" to the level of greek tragedy. Christenson and Portman are stunning in this scene. The way their relationship just disintergrates before our eyes is so well done and seeing Anakins rage and anger is really quite disturbing.The tragedy continues with Anakins downfall at the hands of his former friend and mentor Obi-Wan. The force with which Ewan Mcgregor delivers his parting words to Anakin are just fantastic and you'll find the immolation of Anakin, even if you know its coming, both shocking and moving. Even though at this point Anakin is throughly evil, you'll still feel, through the music and Mcgregors performance, a great sense of compassion for Anakin plight.So what about the technical aspects of this film? Firstly Lucas's direction is superb. If he was rusty for Phantom and going somewhat through the motions with Clones, then with Sith he definatly rises to the occasion. This is the film he made the Prequels in order to make. This is the tale he's been waiting 30 years to tell. The how and why Star Wars happened.Like Lucas and all the actors, John Williams delivers his best Prequel work on this film. Many of his pices of music are by turns operatic and tragic. The music that accompanys Anakin and Padmes silent ruminations, the fall of the Jedi, the disturbing ""Godfatheresque"" moment of Palpatines triumph as Anakin wipes out the remaining Sepratist leaders and the music that accompanys the battle of Anakin/Obi-Wan and Sidious/Yoda are all notable musical highlights. Listen out at the end of the film and during the credits for pieces of music from ""Star Wars"" itself - Hinting at the hope to come and taking the movie full circle.The special effects, sound effects and costumes are outstanding as ever. Its easy to take ILM's fabulous special effects for granted, but the fact is they produce jaw dropping scene after jaw scene. How/why they never won an Oscare for the Prequels is totally beyond me!The editing from Roger Barton and Ben Burtt is much improved on Burtts solo edit for Attack of the Clones.Also greatly improved is the digital camera. Where Attack of the Clones had a some how false and shiny look to it, Revenge of the Sith looks much more gritty and realistic. If you didn't know, you would definatly think this movie has been shot using regular ""film"" cameras, rather than groundbreaking digital cameras.Revenge of the Sith is a fantastic contrast to The Phantom Menace. If the colour of Phantom is all greens and blues, this film is all blacks and reds. Where Phantom was light, this film is dark. Where Phantom was goofy, this film is mature. There is, very much a sense of despair and desperation about this film and this contrast actually makes The Phantom Menace more interesting, in my opinion. It doesn't negate all the many problems Menace has, but it at least justifys through contrast, the tone that Lucas chose for Epsiode I. Aside from brief chinks of hope with the arrival and splitting up of the twins right at the end of the film, Revenge of the Sith is unremittingly dark. Some scenes, such as the creation of Darth Vader are actually quite disturbing - Hence the 12 certificate.As far as extras go, Revenge of the Sith is unfortunatly somewhat lacking compared to Menace and Clones. The main documentery ""Within A Minute"" is very poor compared to Menaces ""The Beginning."" Aside from that the extras contain the usual film maker commentery, deleated scenes, trailers, web-docs (which are excellent) and music video. But with this DVD its the film that speaks for itself not the extras. So even though the extras are *** affairs, the movie itself is a brilliant *****Along with The Empire Strikes Back, Revenge of the Sith is my personal favourite Star Wars movie. The visual poetry of the final scenes (first dealing with the mother, then the father, then the daughter and finally the son) is just beautiful. As we arrive at the final scene where baby Luke is delivered by Obi-Wan to Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru and the twin suns set over Tatooine, we come full circle and you'll have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by the sheer beauty, opera and poetry of it all.It may not have been a smooth ride, but this film made the Prequels a worthwhile project.Thank you George Lucas for the wonderful ride that is the Star Wars Saga."	5.0	Greek Tragedy Meets Morality Tale - George Lucas's Masterpiece	2008-10-11	9	8	1

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2W6ZK51A4V7Q4	"greatbong ""greatbong"""	"A caveat: I grew up watching Star Wars. My dad took me to see Star Wars Part 1 (now Part 4) in Metro theatre, Kolkata in 1980 and ever since then I have been a junkie. In 1981 when my dad was a visiting professor at Cornell and I was going to school in Ithaca, I got further sucked up into the Star Wars ethos buying almost 20 action figures and watching the next installments of the epic and fighting with my schoolmates of whether C3PO was cooler or R2D2. Hell I even saw the cartoon spinoff---the Ewoks whose title song went :We are the E E E E E Ewoks, one happy happy family.So as you can see I find it very difficult to objectively evaluate a Star Wars movie. For someone who even liked the silly cartoon show based on the Ewoks, it's only natural that I love all the movies of the series.The critics unequivocally hated the ""Phantom Menace"". Ok it was a bit boring and protracted but the final deathmatch between Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan on one side and the ""most-evil-looking-character-ever"" Darth Maul was a classic. The place where Obi-Wan and Darth Maul stand on opposite sides of the force-field sizing each other up waiting for Darth Maul to flick the switch and get that split second advantage----just gives me the willies to even think of it.Some people actually liked ""Attack of the Clones"". I loved it. Granted the romantic scenes were embarrassingly cheesy, Christensen's acting was wooden and laughable----but who cares a rat's ass about dialogues and acting in a Star Wars flick ? It's all about the vision and execution-----and ""Attack of the Clones"" was all about that. My moment of the movie is when Yoda, in an uncharacteristically badass mood, barges in on a marauding Count Dooku, and the lightsaber from the left holster flies into his right hand. A little touch..... of magic.And so, like a wide-eyed kid, I went to see the last Star Wars movie---the Revenge of the Sith. I was like a believer going to service at the temple---not the rational, hypercritical viewer I usually am. I knew Iwas going to be easily satisfied---all I wanted to see is how Lucas would seamlessly integrate the two trilogies. If he did a half decent job at that, I would have got my money's worth. So did I ?You bet I did. ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a masterpiece. It ties up all the loose ends and brings the Star Wars saga to an explosive conclusion. Yet it is so much more ----a tragedy of galactic proportions, breath-taking in its pace , mind boggling in its technical brilliance, epic in its scope and unusually adept in its performances.Anakin Skywalker's character, which had seemed to be cartoonish and petulant in the preceding movies , no small measure due to Christensen's limitations comes into its own in RS. Christensen is also vastly improved in his repertoire and does an admirable job reflecting the deeply troubled Jedi knight. George Lucas spends considerable effort on character-development and Skywalker's decent into hellish madness is well-justified, smooth and believable.In Phantom Menace, we see the child Skywalker with a fascination for fixing things. However as he grows older, he still clings onto the belief that all things may be fixed and fate can always be changed. All it needs is more power. While such a simple logic may work in the workshop, it rarely does in the real world or even in the CGI world of Star Wars.When Skywalker gets premonitions of his wife Padme dying, he wants to rectify the situation despite the fact that he knows it is inevitable. In comes Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious, the false prophet, who promises to give Skywalker the power to fix anything he wants----a power the Jedi order can never give him. Neither can the Sith but that Skywalker discovers too late---3 films too late to be exact. He need not have waited for so long---the monologue of Palpatine deliciously hints at the falseness of his claim but Anakin, like Macbeth listening to the wicked witches, takes his words at face value and does not grasp the subtext.What's remarkable about RS is that the CGI never supplants the story---something the previous 2 installments cannot claim. As a result, the enduring moments of the movie are those of human drama, tragedy, sacrifice and death. Whether it be the sequence where the Chancellor is cleverly corrupting the vulnerable Skywalker by preying on his insecurities or Obi-Wan anguishing over his ruined dream or Yoda plaintively accepting defeat and exile---the beauty comes from the character interaction, acting and expressions --- aspects of moviemaking that Lucas is notorious for neglecting in his work.For me however the best scene of the movie is not any of the breathtaking battle set-pieces or the epic battle between Vader and Skywalker or Darth Sidious and Yoda. It is a scene where Anakin and Padme are in their apartment with the sunlight washing them in golden hues. They stand separate, there is no dialogue (mercifully) and Anakin tries to come to terms with Padme's impending death. Despite the sun and the beauty of the scene, the sense of impending doom is overpowering---you don't need to have a Jedi master's instinct to know that there is no saving Anakin from now on.George Lucas has also been not known for subtlety---there are several heavy-handed touches in this movie too but this wordless exchange between the doomed protagonists was the highlight of the movie for me.In conclusion, go watch Revenge of the Sith NOW. Cancel meetings, dates, a visit to the dentist, or an oil-change appointment.Instead feel the hum of the lightsabers, the metallic breathing of Vader, the rousing score by John Williams and a tear or two on your cheek.Star Wars---take a bow.

Hey, but lots of things blow up, so it is all worth it.This movie is a big screen movie. While it is certainly a bad movie in many respects, Revenge of the Sith will not translate well on a television; there is far too much going on to not get completely entangled in this world.I say this is the best movie of the first three. Gone are some of the stupidest portions of the mythology, like midichlorian virgin births. Unfortunately, the replacement parts are so contrived only a true Star Wars fan will forgive them.The acting is bad. Surprisingly, however, Hayden Christensen's acting actually improves. This is not saying much, as he should have won the pinnochio award for his wooden performance in Episode 3.The script is bad. So many plot elements are thrown in without any apparent reasoning. What, for example, is the motivation for Anakin to reveal the slaughter of the sand people to Palpatine (apparently between movies)? It is merely a way to institute a talk about the dark side, I guess. In addition, many of the plot turns are simply means to get characters to interesting planets with interesting creatures like Wookies and evil coughing robots (yes, elderly robots with coughing fits and no, I am not making this up).The dialog is bad. To push the story through, we need some dialog, but the dialog is rushed. There are just too many things blowing up to spend any time in character and story development.The flow is bad. As everyone is already aware, the primary focus of this movie is explaining how Anakin becomes Darth Vader. It is filling a hole. It does a bad job of filling this hole, as it forgets what needs to be in place to fulfill both ends of the equation. It betrays Ep II by making a mockery of the anger in Anakin (wooden anger, of course). It also betrays the first three by forgetting a few key elements.On the positive side, the action is great. Sometimes it is coming at you so fast that you lose focus on the actors and start watching the incredible depth of field.The music is great. This film could have been a simple rehash of previous scores. I am thankful it is not. Much of the music is fanfare, of course, as there is a lot of action. If the script conveyed the mood as well as the music, this could be a good movie.The faithful will likely pan my review, as Star Wars is a religion for some. I am also a fan, but have been greatly disappointed with the horrible way Lucas has destroyed the magical world he created in the first trilogy. If it were not for the action and special effects, I would rate this one even lower.The bottom line for most, however, is ""should I see this film""? If you want to see the story filled in? Yes. If you are a fan? Yes. If you like action films? Yes. But, see it on the big screen rather than wait for the DVD."	2.0	Best of the First Three Movies	2005-05-22	15	8	7
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A25QXIFEHR6900	Gregory Alongi	Revenge of the Sith was a flawless final piece of the Star Wars puzzle. It's exciting, visually dazzling, funny, sad, and definately interesting. It answers all the questions that episodes one and two created, and does it perfectly.If you thought Anakin Skywalker was just a funny naive kid, and Darth Vader was just an evil man in a black suit, this film will open your eyes to a new light. I feel one of the hardest things a story can do is make the audience feel sympathy for the villain, and this movie pulls it off exactly how it should be done. This movie is a collector's piece and will put your money to good use.	5.0	Such a tragic story	2005-05-23	5	2	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3P0KI3M51LI01	Gregory Masciola	Ah, the final installment to the prequel trilogy is complete.  We start in the middle of a huge battle scene in which Obi-Wan and Anakin are on a mission to rescue Senator Palpatine who has been kidnapped.  They rescue him and kill Count Duku in the process.  The only thing during this sequence that bothered me was R2; he's done by CGI and the way he seems to move is more like some cartoon character than a robot, and his screaming gets a bit annoying.After Anakin and Obi-Wan return to Coruscant, Padme reveals that she is pregnant.  Anakin is very happy, but later he has nightmares of her dying during childbirth and doesn't know what to do.He is then put in a difficult situation because he is asked to join the Jedi Council, but he is not made a Jedi Master (which angers him a bit).  The difficulty is that the Council and Senator Palpatine are both puting different ideas into his head.  The council suspects that Palpatine is up to something, while Palpatine is telling Anakin that the Council is going to try to take over the republic.  Anakin has no idea who to believe.Later, Senator Palpatine tells Anakin an old legend about the Sith and that they have the powers to prevent people from dying (maybe even Padme).  While Anakin keeps going back and forth from the Council to Palpatine, he discovers that Palpatine is actually the Sith Lord they have been looking for and reports it to Mace Windu.  They then go to arrest Palpatine, but he resists, using his famous electric powers to attack Windu.  But Windu reflects the powers back at Palpatine with his lightsaber, which changes Palpatine into that hideous wrinkled man that we all remember.  Suddenly, Anakin snaps and chops off Windu's hands to stop him from killing Palpatine and Windu is thrown to his death from the window in front of them.  Anakin has decided that he must learn the ways of the Dark Side if he wishes to prevent Padme's death, so he offers his services to Palpatine, who sends him on a mission to kill the remaining Jedi.Then, Anakin is sent to a place filled with lava to hide.  Padme knows where he is, but doesn't know that he has turned to the Dark Side.  She takes a ship from Coruscant to where he is (not knowing that Obi-Wan has snuck on board).  When she meets up with Anakin, she realizes that he has become evil.  Anakin then sees Obi-Wan in the ship, and challenges him.  We then go back and forth from the lightsaber duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan, and another between Yoda and Palpatine.Eventually, Obi-Wan manages to cut off Anakin's legs and Anakin is badly burned (but not killed).  Back on Coruscant, Yoda manages to evade Palpatine and escapes in a blockade runner.  Obi-Wan leaves the planet he's on with Padme and takes her to a medical place where she gives birth to two babis (Luke & Leia).  Palpatine senses that Anakin is in danger and goes to his rescue, finding him burnt but alive, and has him sent to another medical lab.  To survive, Anakin must rely on a mechanical body and becomes Darth Vader.We then go back to Yoda and Obi-Wan, where Yoda says something about Qui-Gon becoming immortal, which seemed totally unneccessary.  Then we see Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader on a Star Destroyer, giving us the feeling of the original trilogy.  They look out the window viewing the construction of the dreaded Death Star.THE ENDNow for me to say what I liked and what I didn't like:-I thought Lucas did a good job in coming up for a reason why Anakin turns to the Dark Side (because he wants to save Padme's life) even though it seems kind of sudden, like he doesn't give it much thought.-I really enjoyed the scene in which Palpatine tells Anakin the legends of the Sith.-I don't mind Jar-Jar as much as so many do, but you will be glad to know that we only see him twice and he says nothing!-The way Obi-Wan's voice is really makes you believe that this Obi-Wan and Alec Guiness's Obi-Wan are the same person.  Thumbs up to Ewan McGreggor!Things I would do different:-R2 and 3PO had basically nothing to do with the movie.  They were just background characters, so they may as well have not existed at the time.-The animal that Obi-Wan rides makes very annoying sounds.-While I knew that Anakin would change from good to evil, I was kind of expecting something similar with Palpatine.  In other words, I wasn't expecting to find out that he was evil all along.-At many parts, Anakin and Palpatine's acting is kind of overdone.  The guy who plays Anakin is much more believable in the quieter and emotional scenes, where his performances in scenes where he has to shout is not very believable.  And when Palpatine has become wrinkled, his voice kind of changes too much; he goes back and forth from that cackly voice he has in Return Of The Jedi to a very deep voice which is not very believable.  We have to understand, though, that is was probably very hard for the actors considering that Lucas had them in front ov the blue screen almost 99% of the time, so that kind of makes it harder to give a believable performance.-Last of all, Yoda's comment at the end about Qui-Gon seems totally unneccessary and out of place, because we obviously don't see him in A New Hope (I hope I didn't just give George an idea).  So Yoda's comment makes no sense.  I kind of have a feeling that George is going to to what Jackson did with Lord Of The Rings: he will put out an extended edition of Revenge Of The Sith which will explain more about that; or he will make an episode 3 & 1/2.My only expectation when I went to see this movie was that it be better than Attack Of The Clones.  Let me say, it was much better, so I was quite pleased.	4.0	Met my expectations	2005-05-21	3	2	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ACKDSX71VI5HY	"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader"""	"SPOILERS FOLLOW""Star Wars: Episode III-Revenge of the Sith"" finishes the series' prequel trilogy on a very high note.  While not perfect, it packs in enough compelling storylines to be a worthy film.  It is the series' darkest movie outside of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" and is the only ""Star Wars"" film rated PG-13.A big misguided idea clouds the big upshot of this movie.  On the downside, George Lucas swiftly kills Christopher Lee's Count Dooku, in favor of highlighting a rasping, evil droid called General Grievous.  When he was introduced in 'Episode II', Mr. Lee's character seemed to have rich capabilities for expansion.  It is unfortunate that he was killed for a filler character designed to sell toys and be a clumsy parallel to Darth Vader.  Dooku could have been used by Chancellor Palpatine as a treacherous double agent, a subtly competitve would-be mentor for Anakin Skywalker, until he would be killed by Palpatine himself.  For his part, Anakin carries on a secretive liason with Padme, but he's troubled by vivid nightmares pointing to disaster for his clandestine romance.  The visual style of the nightmares make for some of the most fascinating imagery in the ""Star Wars"" saga. Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor completely mature into their roles and offer their best performances in a ""Star Wars"" film.  Hayden Christiansen also matures nicely for this film, the pivotal transformation for his character.  A paint-by-numbers approach saps that storyline of appropriate momentum, but the eventual appearance of Darth Vader is very gratifying.Also featuring the debut of Chewbacca in the prequel trilogy, ""Star Wars: Episode III-Revenge of the Sith"" is very, very good."	4.0	The final Star Wars prequel lines up very nicely to the classic original films	2011-09-24	2	1	1

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1EYUZTL1RY5CV	"Guy Brown ""Guy"""	My Review On The MovieThis was a great way to end this 6 part series. George Lucas is one of the finest directors and writers ever and Star Wars Episode 3 really proves that.The whole cast returns for this movie. Ian McDiarmid, in my opinion, stole the show. Just seeing him evolve into the character he debut as in Return Of The Jedi, was just so amazing and was well told. Ewan McGregor and Christensen Hayden give us one of the best lightsaber fights ever, definitely one of the longest, but just the effort the two gave is amazing.I never did like Natalie Portman as Padme in the two previous Episodes, but her performance in this film really impressed me. Frank Oz returns for his fifth Star Wars movie, and once again, the character Yoda is the power of the movie, and his fight with the Chancellor is very well done. Samuel L. Jackson returns in this movie, i wasn't really impressed by how he died, i thought that was one of the weaker moments but good nonetheless.The CGI in this movie is completely awesome. As good as the Episodes 1 and 2 were visually, Episode 3 takes it to a completely different level.The acting is a little better, but like the rest of the Star Wars films, they try to keep it very Sci-fi in the acting.Overall, a 5 out of 5 on Episode 3, this movie has all the magic that made 4-6 such classics. Even though Episodes 1 and 2 were good, Episode 3 is definitely the best out of those 3.My Review On The DVD ExtrasThis DVD offers everything we would expect, Commentary, Deleted Scenes, some brief interviews with cast and crew, trailers, etc. I give the extras a 5 out of 5. This 2-disc set for Stars Wars: Episode 3 is perfect.	5.0	A Classic Movie On A Classic DVD	2005-12-28	4	1	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2ZP8PIYL4EHTP	"G. Vernon ""gv"""	"I was 9 when Star Wars came out and it truly changed my life. It would be interesting to have a count of how many hours of my life have been spent on sidewalks in block-busting lines awaiting the next show of Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. A lot.Even at 15, Return of the Jedi was a disappointment. Boba Fett's end, the dialogue, the Ewoks, that song at the end--how could it all have gone so wrong? Of course, all was forgiven after The Phantom Menace. Yet each time I've watched that film I've tried to give Lucas the benefit of the doubt and enjoy it for what it is. And I've tried to sit through the wandering plot lines and loose ends of Episodes I and II with patience, allowing for Lucas to pay it all off with Episode III.So here we are. After 28 years, Episode III arrives and I, at 36, need to check in as one disappointed Star Wars fan.SPOILERS FOLLOW:Here's what we now know, having seen Episode III-1. There was never any reason for ""midi-chlorians."" Ever.2. There was never any reason to get to know Qui-Gonn Jinn. Just a Jedi to die at the end of Menace.3. There was never any reason for the Gungans, or more unfortunately, for Jar Jar Binks. He is virtually nonexistent in II and III.4. There's no reason Obi-Wan didn't immediately recognize, and expect, Artoo's arrival on Tatooine.5. There's no reason Vader didn't recognize C3PO and Artoo on sight.6. There's no reason Leia's dialogue in Return of the Jedi would have any relevance to Luke regarding their mother. Leia never knew Padme, and when she spoke of her mother she could only know Bail Organa's wife. She never knew she was adopted, believing herself to be the daughter of the Organas.In this film alone there is no reason for Yoda to travel to Kashyyk and encounter Chewbacca other than to drop Chewbacca into the film, and at that he's given precious little to do. He's utterly wasted, which makes his appearance more ""bitter"" than ""sweet.""Not to put too fine a point on it, but Lucas gives us Darth Vader killing Luke and Leia's mother. With a simple line of dialogue that makes no sense he tries to absolve Vader while she's giving birth, but it's ludicrous and it really twists the mythology. In general, are we all cool with the Lucas idea that mass-murderers deserve forgiveness if they embrace their goodness before dying? Probably too philosophical...The battle scenes are fun and the light saber fights are certainly highlights. There's way too much digital junk in every frame, in the sense that all the trickery looks cartoonish at best and distracts from the story (what there is of it) at worst.The pacing is exciting and if anything it redeems the utterly boring pace of the first two.But does it redeem the series? Absolutely not. It may sound like an odd comparison, but let me compare it to the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy. The first was a standalone film that could have tanked and wouldn't have earned sequels (so it's mostly self-contained and aside from the coda at the end doesn't really need a sequel). But the parts 2 and 3 are so fulfilling to the story and have so many neat references to each other, it's as if they form one wonderful, unified whole. I suppose the same is true of the ""Lord of the Rings"" but since they're based on well thought out books it's no surprise they're seamless.At the end of the day the Star Wars series, which can at last be judged as a whole complete tale, is one disjointed mess. Loose ends abound, continuity is ignored, even the looks of the ships goes from complex to simple and looks like technology in reverse. Too bad Lucas didn't trust the audience enough to try to make the earlier technology look like it actually preceded the technology in IV - VI (the same fatal error made by the producers of Star Trek: Enterprise).Look, we're all glad this is a better movie than the awful first two. But does anyone else feel totally ripped off that at the end of the day we've endured all these years and all these films to get only one brief shot of Darth Vader -- the REAL Darth Vader -- looking out a window? Am I the only Star Wars fan who walked out of the theater shaking his head and saying ""Disappointed, I am, and misguided these prequels were.""??"	3.0	Entertaining and frustrating at the same time	2005-05-28	126	61	65

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AKWO7PMFZ9ZSU	"Hank ""The Hammer"""	"Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith was a spectacular film with major battle sequences and riveting lightsaber duels. It begins with a 20 minute heart pounding dogfight in Coruscant's atmosphere where both heroes Skywalker and Kenobi are flying Jedi fighters and blasting Vulture droids,buzz droids and attacking separatist ships with the assistance of the clones in arc-170's and republic warships. It continues inside the Trade Federation flagship Invisible Hand, where both the political leader and military leader of the separatists are: Count Dooku and General Grievous. Also to note that this is a rescue mission for Supreme Chancellor Palpatine is a prisoner of the separatists, he's chained to a command chair on the flagships bridge.The first of 5 lightsaber duels takes place here on this bridge as heroes Anakin and Obi-Wan face Count Dooku in battle. Ultimately it comes down to Skywalker and Dooku after Kenobi is knocked unconscious. Dooku is most certainly overconfident but what he senses(and this can only be understood from reading the book) is doubt in his own ability, that somehow Skywalker has mastered his fear and that the Dark Side is prevalent within him. Anakin cuts Dooku's hands off and possesses both his and Dooku's lightsaber,and holds them like a scissor against the count's throat. ""Kill him!Kill him now"" voices Palpatine. Anakin doesn't want to for the count is unarmed literally, but the Dark forces surge within Anakin and it makes him very powerful, he beheads Count Dooku. Anakin can't fathom what he's done, but Palpatine tells him reasonably that Dooku was too dangerous to keep alive. Anakin buys into this but escaping this doomed ship with the chancellor is top priority.After being captured by Grievous, it's R2-D2 to the rescue, Grievous despite being an interesting new villian, is nothing short of a coward and flees the doomed ship, and making sure that he jettisons all escape pods so that the heroes are stranded. In the end Anakin using the force is fully capable of landing the spacecraft or more accurately half of the craft. It's Anakin who takes the glory from the cheering crowd,though he wanted Obi-Wan to join in the merriment,however, Obi-Wan was never much the glory hound.IF YOU LOOK REAL HARD DURING THIS SCENE WHEN ANAKIN AND OBI-WAN'S TRANSPORT TOUCHES DOWN, THIS BEING RIGHT BEFORE OBI-WAN ENCOURAGES ANAKIN TO TAKE A BOW FOR HE HAS EARNED THIS GLORIOUS DAY, JOINING THE CHANCELLOR AND SENATORS,ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER A VERY FAMILIAR LOOKING FREIGHTER CRUISES INTO THE SCENE AND LANDING ON ONE OF THE PLATFORMS IT'S,""THE MILLENIUM FALCON.""After this epic beginning the tale will journey in separate directions for different characters. Anakin is told by the Chancellor that he is to be his personal representative on the Jedi council, an unheard of move that disturbs the Jedi for they believe the Chancellor is not to be trusted. A shroud of the Dark Side looms like a cloud over Palpatine, the Jedi uncertain whether he's the Sith master or under his guise of power will not grant Skywalker the rank of master, and furthermore a request is made to Anakin by Obi-Wan on orders of the council, to spy on Palpatine. Something that disturbs Anakin's physical and mental status. For he believes truly that Jedi don't spy, they don't skulk about like a thief in the night. In a stirring descision, Anakin visits the Chancellor while he's attending a sort of theatrical opera or something or other, and Palpatine discerns the truth from Anakin's emotional state,""So they sent you to spy on me."" It is here when Palpatine preys on Anakin's emotional state, for the fear of losing his beloved Padme to death's untimely calling. Palpatine tells a tale which he eventually reveals later on to be true about a Sith Lord, Darth Plagueis ""The Wise"" a powerful warrior who had discovered a way to bring those deceased back to the living. However, most ironically he couldn't save himself from death as he was murdered in his sleep by his apprentice, which later on we learn that Darth Sidious/Chancellor Palpatine was his apprentice.As Anakin is waffled with confusion and after a visitation with Yoda who tells Anakin what he doesn't want to here, namely to let go and that everything eventually dies, even stars die out, young Skywalker tenders a leaning towards Palpatine's teachings.Yoda will leave Coruscant, a pivotal descision that will take the powerful Jedi Master to Chewie's homeworld of Kashyyk to aide the wookies in their struggle against the Separatists.Yoda will go with an army of clones. This was a move designed specifically to force the Sith Lord to reveal himself now that Master Yoda was far away from Coruscant.After learning the whereabouts of Separatist military leader General Grievous on the planet Utapau Obi-Wan was unanimously chosen by the council to lead the sole charge in destroying him. Anakin grew frustrated and believed that he should have been sent instead. But in yet another pivotal move, he was to remain on Coruscant.Obi-Wan arrives in Utapau, a strange planet with hollowed out caverns and confronts Tion Medon, a frightening alien  who welcomes Kenobi and with a veiled undertone reveals that his people are being held hostage by the droid army. The Separatist leaders are hidden within this planet. Grievous receives a message from Sidious, he's to instruct the Separatist leaders including Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray, that they are to venture to the lava planet of Mustafar where they'll be safe. The second lightsaber duel soon begins between Kenobi and Grievous.Grievous with four arms is fully capable of wielding a lightsaber in each one. Count Dooku taught him how to use them and he's the first non-Jedi or Sith to fight in a lightsaber duel in any Star Wars movie. An incredible battle with Kenobi ensues, at one point Grievous is rotating two lightsabers so fast that they look like propellers with him about to lift off. Obi-Wan charged with the force slices away at two of Grievous' arms and eventually when the clone soldiers arrive and battle with the droids, Grievous seizes the oppurtunity to escape. At one bizarre point he changes his biodroid body into an arachnid, really creepy. Obi does battle with Grievous bodyguards and pursues the general atop a Boga not unlike a Dewback, except with birdlike feathers adorning their lizardlike face and their strange honking. When Kenobi finally reaches Grievous who's about to escape in his ship, Kenobi confronts him, minus his lightsaber which he dropped along the way(hoping that Anakin wouldn't find out about that, seeing the fact that he always got on Anakin's case for losing his lightsaber or for it being destroyed) faces Grievous for the last time, foolishness on the generals part in not finishing off Kenobi quickly allowed Obi-Wan to do the unthinkable, He uses a blaster! And promptly fires at the exposed mid-section of General Grievous and seconds later  Grievous implodes with a fury of death. Now the military leader of the Separatists is dead.On Kashyyk, Yoda overseas a battle between the wookies and the droid army, on Coruscant a communication to Mace Windu by Obi-Wan lets him know that Grievous is dead. Anakin is witness at first hand to a dark revelation by Palpatine the Supreme Chancellor of Coruscant and the galactic republic that he is the Sith Master, Darth Sidious. After Anakin with his blue lightsaber inches away from Sidious's face fails to take him down, conflict is tearing the insides of young Skywalker. He leaves and tells Master Windu, who isn't shocked, but who is extremely hesitant about facing the Chancellor by himself, three other Jedi Masters will accompany him, Saesee Tinn, Agen Kolar and Kit Fisto. Yet, Anakin is told  by Windu to remain at the Temple, this was an unwise move by Windu for when Anakin does arrive he doesn't see a fully powerful Sith but rather a weak old man about to killed without trial by a Jedi. That is the moment when balance will be brought back to the force. But before that the confrontation between a Sith Master and four Jedi Masters.Now in the book when Palpatine was confronted by Mace and the other Jedi, he recorded the conversation and later played it back to the Senate, when they heard it it seemed like the Jedi had gone insane, wanting to kill Palpatine and take control of the Senate. It was altered in the movie, it would have been cool had they followed the book, be that as it may Mace tells Palpatine,"" Your under arrest Chancellor"" 'Are you threatening me Master Jedi' and then bedlam, Palpatine's blazing red saber first connects a death blow onto Saesee Tinn, then Agen Kolar and finally Kit Fisto in what appears to be a matter of seconds. This being the first time Palpatine has excercised a lightsaber in battle against the Jedi, and defeats three Master Jedi in mere seconds, talk about confidence. Though in the films third lightsaber duel his struggle to take Windu will not be easy, for Windu is a Korun Master and has a style all his own. When Anakin comes on the scene Palpatine's weapon is lost and flat on his back where Mace Windu is brooding over him about to end his life. Palpatine pleads with Anakin and begging Master Windu for his life.This is the moment where balance shall be brought back to the force. Both adversaries are confident that young Skywalker is on their side. But only one he chooses, the choice is not easy but at first it does not seem deliberate, when Mace tells Anakin that it's to dangerous to keep Palpatine alive Anakin disagrees and believes that he must stand trial seemingly because he's the accused and not the executed.All the while Palpatine's force lightning is shooting out at Mace, and he's using his lightsaber to deflect it and the lightning comes back to Palpatine and scars his face hideously, the same hideous face from Return of the Jedi.Now we know how that came about. Neither combatants can holdout much longer.This is when Palpatine preys on Anakin's weakness for life. ""You see the Jedi wish to destroy me, their assassins, who will it be, I can save her and I can teach you how to save her. But if I'm dead you'll never procure this power"" Then, a searing pain radiates through Mace's body, for Anakin has cut Windu's arm off. And then after an incredible cacaphony of screaming from Mace, Palpatine seizes the moment and force lightning blazes away from his detestable finger tips into Mace's body, crippling him with severity, and with the Chancellor's window already detroyed from battle his force lightning lifts windu off his feet and he is cast out into the nights sky of Coruscant, plunging forever, forever. Mace Windu a Jedi Master, leader of the council, went out in a blaze of glory. I salute you.Anakin sick for what he's just done weakly surrenders the Jedi within to Palpatine and  joins him willingly to allow his being a life altering state to let the Dark Side of the force embrace his life, forever. Now the familiar robe of Sidious enshrines Palpatine and while Skywalker kneels before him Palpatine calls the Dark Side to embrace his new apprentice. Rise, rise my apprentice, Anakin Skywalker is no more for his temper of evil has ended young Anakin's life and now he willjoin me as "" DARTH VADER ""  Darth is the title of all Sith lords though we never learn about the origin of where the name Vader derrives from. (Maul, Tyranus and Sidious are easy to understand, Maul was basically an apt name for the Zabrak,to maul is to beat or bruise simply to hammer hey that's my name  like a spike. He was flat out a mauler, from Tyranus one could say tyrannical, and Sidious was insidious which means treacherous. But what is the origin of the name Vader? Was it an ancient warriors name?We learn that the Clone Wars, soon to be ended, were not about the Separtist movement, that was engineered by Palpatine, the Clone Wars was only about one thing, the extermination of the Jedi Order. During the wars three years many Jedi have already died. And now the rest would follow when Palpatine executed order 66. A command to all clones that the Jedi were now an enemy to the Republic. The clones simply didn't obey because the Chancellor had spoken but because he awakened them for their designed and outright purpose. It had to do with a chip implanted in their brain. Now they would only follow the words of Palpatine because he had direct control over these creations and no one else had that power. Only his command could drive them for his greater glory.In heart rendering scenes we witness the deaths of Jedi, and most disturbing of all Darth Vader's purge of the Jedi Temple. The younglings, it is very sad and it hit me harder than I could have realized when the Jedi were hunted and killed, but most of all the children. To see that was sickening, this is the very reason for the pg-13 rating. IF YOU HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN, WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE OLDER. THEN THEY MAY UNDERSTAND, AND NOT UNTIL THEN.Only two Jedi will be left, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda. Palpatine who before the Senate will tell them that it is the dawning of a new era, this is to be the birth of an Empire. The First Galactic Empire with he as the Emperor. Darth Vader is ordered by the Emperor to go to Mustafar and end the war by eliminating the Separtist leaders Gunray and company. Vader's mistake is upon visiting Padme he tells her where he's going. Because later on when she refuses to tell Obi-Wan where he is, he hides amongst the darkness and stows away aboard her ship while she sets a course for Mustafar."	5.0	Last of the old Jedi, first of the new (MAJOR SPOILER)	2005-05-30	11	2	9
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3I3QKV0SU9YQ6	"Hanle ""Hanle"""	Finally after two decades George Lucas finishes his work of the Sci-Fi epic movie series Star-Wars. It had been in my life since the first Star-Wars movie, the initial weapon light saber has always been one of my fantasies. The third episode really wraps up the story of young Annakin Skywalker. His desperate struggle for love, which was forbidden by the Jedi order, led him to destruction. From the fall of the Jedi order to the start of the epic war, everything seems to be so dramatic.The special effects are also one of its features, the battle fields present just some of the scenes you will never see in other movies. Laser beams everywhere, monstrous battle cruisers and light saber fights. It's just what a Sci-Fi fan wants.I am a big Star-War fan myself, this is definitely worth collecting.	4.0	Long Road to the Beginning	2006-05-13	2	2	0

The Phantom Menace was well done and I was itching to watch the Attack of the Clones. When Attack of the Clones came out, I was extremely dissapointed. The battle scenes were poorly shot 'cause everything was ""flying"" around and I couldn't make sense of what was going on. The ""love story"" was gag worthy. Lucas could have just laced the love story through the main thought like he did with Hans Solo and Leia in the original trilogy. I definately would wait till the Revenge of the Sith came out on video or DVD before watching it. Even then I would not waste my money on renting it and would just wait till a friend buys it and then just borrow it if the reviews say the movie wasn't well made.In general, I would wait a little to decide whether to watch the movie or not.

Read BOOK!"" needs to do a bit of out-of-the-box thinking before he writes another review.  He obviously missed several key points and, by the looks of it, missed the preceeding films that built up to RotS (which happens to be the climax of said two-film exposition).Further, this movie shows perfectly the change of Anakin and why he falls.  It's because of love, a love that was developing over two films and finally culminating in a tragedy in RotS.  Palpatine uses Anakin's confusion through AotC and RotS to poison his mind so, when the inevitable time comes, Anakin needs only a nudge (""You are fulfilling your destiny, Anakin."") to turn fully to the Dark Side.Brilliance.Not a note was missed in this film, it is the perfect climax to the saga that has enchanted countless lives and shown us what its like to live in an epic galaxy so far far away."	5.0	A Great Film For People WHO UNDERSTAND FILMS	2005-10-10	11	4	7
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A26HFSVLAGULIM	"Heather L. Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi"""	"IN A NUTSHELL: Fills in a lot of missing elements - nicely!With this DVD we can take-off to the original trilogy with a better understanding of what came before.WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT: Parents take note - PG-13 [other Star Wars films PG]----- TURNING TO THE DARK SIDE:Parents should take note that this is and deserves to be PG-13, whereas the first two of the trilogy were just PG. Having said that, this is a dark tale [no-pun intended] and a real heartbreaking one as well. It is also an excellent Space-Fantasy in its own right, and is the best of this recent Star Wars Trilogy in my opinion. We do get to see how Annakin somehow went wrong and in so doing, ""TURNED TO THE DARK SIDE!""We also get to see just what Yoda meant in ""The Return of the Jedi"", when he told Luke ""not to underestimate the power of the emperor, or suffer your father's fate you will!"" Before the ""Revenge of the Sith"", we could only guess what that, and other references to the past meant, and imagine them for ourselves. Now our imagination has been replaced and/or confirmed with facts. With this final film of the prequel trilogy complete, the Star Wars universe has just expanded enough to bridge the gap between what had transpired during the original trilogy and their prior causes, as illustrated most graphically with this now fully operational prequel trilogy. For that reason, ""The Revenge of the Sith"", is the most important film of the new trilogy, and is almost essential viewing for anyone wishing to fully enjoy the original trilogy now available on DVD in an enhanced edition.Of course whether or not George Lucas' continued tinkerings with the original trilogy represents enhancement is totally up to the individual.ABOUT THE DVD: I prefer the Widescreen editionSpecial Features include some very neat featurettes, a couple hours worth, and the deleted scenes which show Padm&eacute; Amidala plotting with the anti-Palpatine movement. Of course the picture quality is great as is the sound, no surprises there.BOTTOM LINE:If you enjoy the STAR WARS series this is a film you will probably appreciate."	5.0	A WONDERFUL ADDITION THAT AIDS IN UNDERSTANDING THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE	2006-01-30	1	1	0
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AUITKX16DITVO	Helel	If Phantom Menace was dissapointing and attack of the clones not all it could have been, this fully shows the brilliance of the series. From the opening space battle, to the surprisingly emotional end lightsaber duel, this is high entertainment that will appeal even to non star-wars fans.The cgi is breathtaking and represents the pinnacle of film as almost animated art, you will find it impossible not to believe that the huge and diverse sets and locations/characters are 95% computer generated. There is alot more back story in this one and a very revealing look at the sith and just who Palpatine is and why he has remained hidden. The resulting manipulation of Anakin is very well done and it doesn't feel contrived or forced.Highlight of the film to me, was the Emperor whose charisma is only matched by Yoda, fitting then that the best fight in the series is between these two. This is also by far the most adult of the series as it does have some genuinly unsettling scenes, such as when Palpatine finally drops his mask of tolerance and shows his almost unrivalled evil and power. In this movie his motivations show the pure emptiness of his soul and as such he is easily one of the best movie villains, totally lacking in conscience with no humanity at all. Well done to the writers for this.The music is compelling and as you would expect from Williams it always fits the mood that the scene requires. The bottom line is if you like Star wars you've probably seen it already and your purchase should be certain, even if you just like a good movie this is one to watch because it triumphs in some many ways.	5.0	The pinnacle of the Prequel Trilogy	2005-09-26	4	2	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3TVVBKWJW00ZA	"Henry Edwards, Jr. ""Henz"""	"*[WARNING: SPOILERS THROUGHOUT]*What a relief! I can now take back what I said in my review for Episode II that George Lucas had ""completely and utterly destroyed whatever good might just have been able to come out of the prequels."" For the most part, this film in my mind redeems Lucas of his awful antics in the previous segments in the saga.I have to admit, though, the opening sequence didn't exactly shoot my hopes through the roof. Having read a few critics' evaluations of the movie, I expected it to be excellent right from the start. It turned out that I was a tad bit disappointed in the beginning of the flick, with the comedy lines by the droids, some cheesy dialogue and subsequent delivery, and a bit of hollow acting (hey, but at least Hayden's a little better) being my main grievances. The awe-inspiring space battle and special effects were great, sure; but I was just afraid that this one was going to be a ""clone"" of the previous films.Boy, was I wrong.My half-disappointment in the first shots' screenplay was soon to be completely erased. Though the movie didn't exactly get on track right off the bat, it soon carried itself through all of its so-so moments in the beginning and justified itself of any of those semi-annoying parts. I thoroughly enjoyed what followed (with a few exceptions).After the intense first scenes, the show quiets down quite a bit (but not for long), following the subtle and not-so-subtle events that ultimately culminate in Anakin Skywalker's (a very unsatisfying Hayden Christensen) transformation into the sinister Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones).The main reason for Anakin's betrayal is that he is afraid his pregnant wife Padme (a pretty bad Natalie Portman) is going to die. He can find no help that sounds good from any of the Jedi (all Jedi Master Yoda [voice of Frank Oz] gives him is garbage about death being a part of life and that we should be happy for the dead). However, his friend and mentor of all things evil, Chancellor Palpatine (an excellent Ian McDiarmid), tells Anakin that if he learns the ways of the Dark Side of the Force, he can save the ones he loves from certain death. Anakin takes Palpatine's false advice, becomes Darth Vader, and commits several evil deeds, including killing dozens of Jedi children in their temple.In the meantime, a couple of interesting and visually compelling subplots take place: Yoda reinforces the Wookies of Kashyyyk with a battalion of clones (thanks for giving them camouflage this time, George!) while Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (a great Ewan McGregor) pursues the evasive half-droid, half-alien Separatist leader General Grievous (computer generated) to an interesting prehistoric-like planet. The battle on the Wookies' homeworld was one of my favorite things to see, and Obi-Wan's duels with Grievous were quite good as well (though the droid general's role as a whole seemed a little hollow to me).Eventually, word reaches Yoda and Obi-Wan that all the Jedi across the galaxy have been killed either by Anakin or the very clone troopers the Jedi lead into battle. Obi-Wan decides that there is no choice but to confront his evil former apprentice once and for all. You probably know how the rest goes: Obi-Wan incapacitates Anakin, Anakin gets the black suit, Palpatine becomes Emperor, and Padme gives birth to (the gigantic newborns) Luke and Leia just before her death.The whole storyline of the movie is great, and it is much better than its predecessors' pathetic attempts at grabbing the audience's interests. This movie is really the harbor of the main part of the prequels that STAR WARS fans actually want to see:  the transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader. The previous two films were simply money-making excuses with almost no purpose; Jar Jar and pathetic love lines are not exactly what I consider essential parts of the story of Anakin's rise and fall.The acting in the movie is sometimes questionable; other times excellent. Hayden Christensen is still one of the worst actors in cinematic history, but in my opinion he was a little better in this film than in Episode II. Natalie Portman can't pull off her lines very well either, though she did have some pretty bad dialogue to work with. Ewan McGregor, however, was awesome throughout the movie. Also, Ian McDiarmid was nothing short of spectacular, and his portrayal of the fallen chancellor could not have been anywhere near as excellent with any other actor.The special effects... need I even mention them? I'm sure everyone knows that they can basically be summed up by one word: STUNNING. The only negative side to all of the movie's computer-generated effects is that sometimes you really get to thinking that they over-did it. What I mean is, on some sets you get the impression that they could have built more of the set than they actually did.The film's soundtrack is absolutely spectacular. Epic, dark, and emotional new themes mingle with several of the classic themes from the original trilogy, making this movie's score one of the best STAR WARS soundtracks composed.To sum the movie all up, I'd say that this is a great film that could have been a little bit better. It has many strong moments (scenes like the Wookiee army on Kashyyyk inspire chills, while emotion runs high at the end of the fantastic, epic duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan) and a few weak ones (rocketeer R2-D2 melting steel faster than a one million degree furnace with his retractable jets). Though it can't really compare with the original trilogy (perhaps RETURN OF THE JEDI, though), it is a heck of a lot better than either of its predecessors and a very good movie as a whole. A few things I would have changed might be:*canning the idiotic comedy lines by the super battle droids*no more midi-chlorian (is that how you spell it?) rubbish*Yoda not giving Obi-Wan some stupid Buddhist (and jarringly out-of-place, I might add) trash about immortality and ""the nether world"" (huh?) of the Force relating to his Obi-Wan's old master*not quite as much reliance on computer-generated stuffAnd that's my two cents' worth.

I loved the stark ""good vs evil"" tone of the original movies, and how they were digitally ""cleaned up"" and enhanced a few years ago prior to being re-released in the theatres and on DVD. I'll also admit to feeling largely betrayed when Episodes 1 and 2 came out in theatres. But Episode 3 is light years ahead in terms of improvement in use of story, character and CGI. ""Mainstream's Worst Enemy"" has broadly brushed the whole series as crap.  Well, he is so full of himself and his supposed truth, that he has missed enjoying one of the best SF-Fantasies ever brought to film.

Some customers in their reviews bitch about this inconsistency, or that loose end not being tied up.  Well, while I may agree with the observation that much was not done, I just tire of hearing people piss and moan about Lucas screwing this or that up.  Episode 3 did follow one old pattern that had emerged in the original trilogy, namely, each movie becoming progressively better as another episode appeared (some will argue with this believing that The Empire Strikes Back was superior to the Return of the Jedi, but it's just an opinion thing).  So just enjoy that.  The CGI was better executed and was a treat for the senses, you were immersed in the sound, and the story was darker and more ""adult"" even though the dialogue remained a weak point.  I enjoyed a story that lived in the world of the Jedi, and attempted to engage it albeit imperfectly.  Lucas did not do many things that I would have liked to see, and there were a number of inconsistencies that were not resolved, but when push comes to shove, so what? He did undertake a massive project, and for better or worse (more better than worse), we, the viewing public, were once more treated to the Worlds of Star Wars.

The events of Episode III were so intense for me, it was like watching The Empire Strikes Back again for the first time (I seriously almost cried at the moment when Anakin was being burned near the lava with no legs screaming at Obi-Wan ""I hate you!!""

I guess it had pretty much no faults besides the acting. My gosh! The love scenes are horrid! Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen's lines are so cheesy and just awful.But besides the acting, the movie's very good. It depicts Anakin's descent into darkness and his conversion to the darkside and into Darth Vader. It also explains why he did this, which I won't give away. The movie also introduces an awesome vilain in General Grievius, some robot guy that has 4 lightsabers. Of course Yoda's the best though! He kicks a**! You just have to love his voice and his lightsaber is so much smaller than everyone else's but he's still the best.

Now reviewers are saying that ROTS it is actually good and so now everyone is quoting reviews as if they said it themselves.  GEORGE LUCAS did not all of a sudden become a good director for this movie and decide to make a good movie, every movie he has made since THX-1138 has been very good.  Revenge of the Sith is at equal quality with all the other five Star Wars movies, the acting and script writing has never been fantastic like everyone seems to believe it is.  Go watch the other films that you hold so dear to your heart and you will find that they are in fact just as silly and cheesy as the current ones.  Every problem you find with the new ones can be seen in the old, the only difference is that you watched the others when you were ten and now you are thirty and bitter that George Lucas has more imagination in his pinky than you and your friends combined.If you didn't like the first two but like this one you are just kidding yourself.

Jin	"Most of the problems with this movie have been discussed by others: the stiff dialogue, the wooden acting, the over-use of CGI, the ham-fisted attempts at making a political statement, the inconsistencies between this and the original trilogy. But ultimately, this could have all been forgiven if the movie had done a good job of charting Anakin's descent to the Dark Side. Unfortunately, Lucas couldn't even get THAT part right, ruining not only this movie, but casting a shadow over the whole Star Wars franchise.Firstly, Episode III's biggest flaw is that it does not build on the character development of Episode II. Although clumsily handled, parts of Episode II did hint strongly at Anakin's Dark Side, which showed itself on several occasions. You'd think in the years between II and III, this would have become even stronger, but instead the beginning of this movie shows he's still a Good Jedi; cracking cheesy one-liners with Obi-Wan and uttering cringe-worthy expressions of love to Padme. So rather than showing a gradual decline, the transition between Nice Guy and Ultimate Evil has to take place in the space of one movie.Secondly, this movie is poorly paced. Far too much time is spent going down side-stories and blind alleys that have little to do with the main plot. The subplot involving General Grevious, for example, doesn't really go anywhere and could have been either trimmed or cut altogether (why not just say Dooku kidnapped Palpatine on his own?). And while it's nice to see Chewbacca again, the reality is that there was no need for a story involving the Wookiees.The combination of these two factors means that Anakin's descent into Darth Vader feels forced, rushed, and very unconvincing. Keep in mind; this plot point is supposed to be the crushing centrepiece of the entire six-movie saga, the very reason for Episodes I-III to exist. Lucas treats it almost like an afterthought, making the whole thing a huge let-down.....was that really ""It""? It doesn't help that once again Hayden Christensen is badly let down by a script that gives him nothing. Anakin still comes across as a whiny little brat, even as Darth Vader (""NOOOOOOOOO!""). Is Darth really stamping his feet and bawling his eyes out under that body armour?Sure, there are some good things about this movie. The CGI and battle scenes are well done, Ewan McGregor really nails it as Obi-Wan, Palpatine livens up every scene he's in, and Yoda gets another energetic light-saber battle. But `Revenge Of The Sith' stands or falls on its portrayal of Anakin, and unfortunately it bungles this terribly."	2.0	Is that it?	2010-01-20	15	12	3

My interest in these Star Wars things had tapered off with the two new prequels. I could not imagine Lucas being able to save the third film with any sort of effort.Well, I;m surprised. I am very surprised.Yes, it's true what you've read. This movie is quite different from the previous two. It is so different I could hardly believe it. Everything that irritated me about the prequels seemed to softly vanish away when I watched this movie. The excessive special effects now serve the story instead of acting as padding. The strange sensation with the prvious two filsm, that about seventy per cent of the scenes are redundant, is totally gone here. Everything seemed polished, well written, well paced. That indefinable ""something"" of a good movie is here!And the atomsphere is by far the darkest and most mature in all the Star Wars movies. Yes, including the old ones. I'v never seen a fantasy or science fiction movie with an atospohere anything like this one. It is unlike, for example, the lord of the rings films. It is perhaps most like watching Oedipus Rex, or The Godfather Part 2, or Lawrnce of Arabia. In structure this film is a vicious, unrelenting Greek tragedy. Perhaps Lucas was straining a bit in finding a way to make Anakin wish to possess dark powers. But I totally bought it. There is an atmosphre of high seriousness to this movie.Maybe the times have something to do with this. Yes, there are references to the current poltiial situation in this movie. But when they arise, such is the demonic atmosphere of this film that they inspire horror rathr than laughter. Lucas actually seems to care about the collapse of liberty in his fictional Galaxy, and we too begin to care.Whereas I kept noticing the useless mechanics of special effects and dialgoye with the prceding films, here everything seems organically connected. For the first time a prequel movie seems absorbing. I thought the special effects were to blame for the failures of the previous movies - now I am more likely to forgive special effects if they serve the story. In fact, I hardly noticed them - for the first time the characters tower over their surroundings, withoutthe distractiions of the past.AThe pathetic Godfather III type references to the Old trilogy now seem to serve the story too. When Yoda has his lightsaber fight this time, I didn't even feel the urge to smile. This time, his fight actually seems to matter. Similarly when jar Jar binks appears, I had absolutely no reaction. The scene he is in is so dreadfully sad that it overshadows any peripheral aspects of the drama.In fact one could say that aboput the entire film. Everything is sacrificed to drama this time, and it really shows.The fight between Mace Windu and Palpatine also shows the difference between the Jedi and Sith creeds. Palpatine fights with such hatred that it is uncomfortable to watch it. We had already seen Darth Vader fighting for the Dark Side in the old trilogy, but then his face was masked. Similarly when Anakin fights Obi Wan, I was struck by the vile atmosphere of hate in the battle. Unlike all the previous light saber fights, the lightsaber is not ""cool"" and used in a chivalric way. It is a device for killing, and killing a lot. And the killing is in earnest here, it is not a cartoon.Seeing Count Dooku appear in this movie made me think of the clunky, corny Episode II. But suddenly Anakin executes him, beheads him with his lightsaber - we see his head bouncing away; and suddenly Star Wars doesn't seem flippant or corny at all. Not at all. It's strange - living in a world where, in Iraq, people are indeed being beheaded in this barbarous way by militants, suddenly it isn't funny at all. Dooku is an unarmed prisoner, and we feel the horror of this atrocity. Can you imagine feeling horror at anything in the phantom menace??Flaws? Certainly there are flaws in the movie. But watching Ep III, I am sure many will suddenly notice the difference betwen a bad movie and a good one, maybe even a fine one. Something indefinable about the elments seems to work this time, and the flaws shrink until they are as insignificant as the flaws in Gone with the wind. The poorish dialogue, the inadequate acting and the excessive special effects now seem second fiddle to the core of the picture. Maybe now I will even be persuaded that Mr Lucas does have some talent, perhaps even a lot of talent.We can prhaps forgive his two failures. In years to come it will be this movie, not the others, that will be remembered."	4.0	Inconceiveably different from the rest of the prequels...	2005-06-16	23	17	6

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A39QEKNEFSJ34Q	hrladyship	"As a fan of the first 3 Star War movies, I had hoped for this prequel trio of movies.  However, when the first 2 came out, I hadn't the heart to see them, based on the previews and cuts seen on TV and elsewhere.  Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi had great character development, wonderful special effects, and the music wasn't bad either.  Okay, the ewoks were more than a little too cuddly and cute, but even ROTJ wasn't at all bad.For years Lucas told the fans that when special effects technology had improved, he would be able to tell us ""the rest of the story.""  Unfortunately, that is much of what is wrong with Revenge of the Sith:  money spent on special effects and little attention paid to character development.  In the storyline, he was so busy trying to tie it all into what happens in the sequels that the characters just got lost.Even the actors seem not to know whom they are portraying or why they're there.  It's difficult to have sympathy for any of them.  The dialogue is stilted.  And the scenes are choppy and without the smooth flow so present in the 3 sequels.  And some things are just plain silly, as when Padme and Anikin meet in plain sight and talk about not letting people know they're together.Others have discussed what they saw as the shortcomings of this film, sometimes passionately.  The reason is that they, and I, wanted to like ROTS.  It was frustrating to have a good scene surrounded by mediocre ones.  The fight scene at the end was spectacular.  But without more explanation than we get here, it's impossible to believe people can live on the volcanic planet without melting.  When Anikin approaches the children in the temple, it's impossible not to feel a sense of horror at what follows.  But his motivation for doing what he does then and after isn't sufficiently portrayed.I generally try to be as objective as possible when reviewing movies and books, but my disappointment with ROTS was so great.  When dealing with the stories of Luke and Leia and the surrounding characters, so many of us cared about their fates.  The only reason to care during this film is to learn why some of the things are as they are in Star Wars.  Strangely, the story made more sense without it."	2.0	I had high hopes	2005-06-05	15	10	5

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2Y3FAO82SU0M0	H. W	I just watched the movie on DVD and it is somewhat disappointing, especially how Anakin turns into dark side which is the major part of this episode. However, the visual effects certainly are superb.There need major reasons why Anakin turns in dark side and starts killing his fellow Jedi knights (and for the better part, he knows what he does is wrong, which means he is not a complete idiot. And we certainly don't expect a Jedi Knight like Anakin is not smart enough). Yet throughout the movie, I don't see any convincing reason why Anakin does all that.There a couple of reasons revealed in the movie: 1) Anakin is unhappy with the Jedi council since they do not give him Master title. 2) Anakin is afraid that his wife Padme will die and he can not save her. Chancellor Palpatine certainly tries to alienate him from Jedi council and seduce him with the hint that by turning to dark side, his wife can be saved. But none of these stories seem to be convincing to me (if I were Anakin, I certainly would not believe in that!). First of all, Obi-Wan is not only his mentor, but also his friend. I don't see how Palpatine becomes closer than Obi-Wan and makes Anakin believes what he says. Secondly, how could Anakin be so fascinated by a dream which may be not true at all and based all his critical decisions on this? If this is true, then he certainly should not be entitled a Jedi Master. And another issue: how come a Jedi Master as wise as Yoda not sense the change in Anakin and not do anything about it? The whole thing is completely confusing and illogical.Another issue is the power of Anakin. Anakin is able to kill Dooku when he is angry and apparently Obi-Wan is no match for Dooku. Then how come later Obi-Wan is able to almost kill Anakin? At that scene, apparently Anakin is very angry and he has already turned to dark side. One would expect him to kill Obi-Wan easily. Another thing is Palpatine certainly says that Anakin would be more powerful than him, yet through even the last episode, Anakin seems to be a no-match for him. This is completely inconsistent and the writer seems to make up anything they want just to make a scene to move.Overall I give it a 3 star for good visual effects and better storyline than the first two episodes.	3.0	confusing and inconsistent	2005-12-19	14	10	4
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2ICW5OUWX2A2V	Ian	"After seeing this movie for the fifth time in theaters (to a packed theater, no less), I figure it's time to write down what I think of the final star wars movie.First off, and I have to say it, this is (in my opinion) the best Star wars ever.  To me, this has everything I wanted.  Awesome villians (Grievious, for example, is one of the most intriuguing villians ever in terms of design), likeable heroes (Ewan McGregor is PERFECT as Obi-wan.  Hayden Christensen is likewise really good as Anakin), and lots of explosions, fights, and awe-inspiring visuals (lots of those!).  There's even an adorable giant lizard that would be great to have as a pet.But for me, what makes this movie great is the story.  To me, it ties everything up nicely.  It answers almost all the questions (the only one I still have is how Leia could remember her natural mother), including why Threepio doesn't recognize Obi-wan or the others.While the previous two prequels were light-hearted action movies, this one takes a dive for the grimmer.  There's a suprising amount of humor in the first act of the movie (that got a lot of laughs from the midnight premiere that I attended), and we need it, because after that, it all goes downhill.I applaud Mr. Lucas for many brilliant touches within the story (yes, that sounds insane, but bear with me please).  Instead of showing Anakin being a power-hungry maniac, Lucas showed some class and intelligence by showing us how Anakin became Darth Vader.  It wasn't for power, or for glory.  Rather, it was for love.  Anakin's love for Padme causes his downfall, which suprised me greatly.  Showing this aspect of Anakin really helped me understand him, and helps make Vader more sympathetic in the origional Trilogy.  And here, when Vader makes his ""First"" lines near the end of the movie, they are very touching (and no, i'm not going to tell you what they are).  Kudos to Lucas for the love.Speaking of Love, I can't see what everyone says about the Anakin/Padme relationship (namely, how it's completely fake).  To me, it works.  The dialog sounds natural, not forced.  It sounds exactly what normal people would say.  Granted, Mrs. Portmans delivery of some of the lines could be better, but overall, to me, it works.And I still cannot figure out why people seem to hate the dialog.  I have found only three questionable bits in the entire movie.""I shouldnt do it.""  ""Do it Anakin!""  ""No, it's not the Jedi way.""  ""Do it!  *slice*  ""I shouldn't have done that""""Anakin, my allegiance is to the republic, to democracy! (snicker)""""Ray shields!""  ""Wait a moment, how did we get into this?  We're smarter then this!""  ""Apparently we're not"".Those are the only things i've found odd about the dialoge.  Were some people hoping for shakespere dialog?""Obi-wan: Harken Anakin! Doeth not this vile act of vilaniy that thee wishes to commence!Anakin: Shuttith thee up master! Thou noest not the divine powers of thee spoken side of dark!Jar Jar: Mesith Jar Jar Binkisths!""Nothing needs to be said about the lightsaber fights, which are absaloutly spectacular.  The last fight between Anakin and Obi-wan is, withought a doubt, the best lightsaber fight in all the star wars movies.  My mouth was open the entire time when I first saw it, and it holds up perfectly to repeated viewings.The acting (which is another thing a lot of people hate) works fine for me.  Hayden Christensen has improved his acting ability tremendously, and is more believable as a result.  Ewan McGregor is likewise perfect as Obi-wan.  It's very easy to believe that he'll become everybodys favorite old guy in the classic trilogy.  Natalie Portman does a good job as Padme.  To me, it appeared that she really did care about Anakin, and chose to see the good in him, rather then the bad.  Ian McDarmid is outstanding as the Emperor (who could kick luke's butt in Return of the Jedi if he choose to), and even Yoda is outstanding (""Not if anything to say about it, I have!"").The final half hour of the movie is breathtaking (Alderran would make a great ski resort!).  Seeing Anakin sustain his horrible injuries (ouch!  Poor guy!), seeing a familiar villian from A new hope, the sunset, etc.  But the most spine tingling moment is when Vader takes his first breath.  A gauranteed spine tingler (gets me every time!).So in conclusion, this is everything I could have asked for in a Star Wars movie.  It ties 95% of all the loose thread plots up together, sets up the events of episodes 4,5, and 6, and brings the star wars saga to a close.There will be many (OK, a lot) who will be dissapointed with this movie, and everything that George lucas does with this legendary franchise.  But the way I see it, is that these people apparently want Mr. Lucas to relieve thier childhood memories, to bring back the awe and wonder that was bestowed upon them upon seeing the first movie for the first time.  But that feeling of nogistalia will never, ever happen, for thier sights have apparently been set too high.  Please, try to see the good that Lucas has done with this movie.  I find it to be a very satisfying and exciting ride.And now, the saga is complete.  What a ride it's been.  But i've enjoyed it every step of the way, and this is an excellent finish to the saga that took us to a galaxy, far, far away..."	5.0	Now, after 28 years, the circle is complete	2005-06-20	5	3	2

Being a bit of a techno geek I can appreciate the incredible effects and CGI work present in this, George Lucas' final Star Wars film.  But even on first viewing I found myself wondering why I was feeling so emotionally disconnected from the plot and the charactors.After viewing the DVD and seeing the additional features, I see now how this film is so very visually satisfying yet emotionally unfulfilling.  It is made clear that Lucas ""evolves"" his script and story points during the filmaking process, and that he has surrounded himself with hundreds of people that revere him in a way that limits true criticism and feedback.Lucas just isn't very good at writing scripts.  Yes, the story unfolds as it should, but the way it does so feels contrived and souless.  The initial space battle is huge but doesn't really achieve anything.....its very expensive eye candy that doesn't serve the myth.  Didn't anyone ever question the basic plot points and there service to the mythos of the redemptive father?  Apparently no one at Skywalker Ranch.This movie was indeed challenging to bring to film because of the incredible pressure of expectation and the sheer potential to be able to bring anything to the screen thru CGI and other effects.  But it was also easy by virtue of the fact that we already know so much of what will happen.  Why not bring in a top tier sci fi writer (or five for that matter) and have several scripts written that he can choose from?The DVD answers this question in the way Lucas shows up with his first draft script well into the production process.  No one dared question the fundemental archetecture of his plot development, or how it could be so much better with more talent applied to its growth.  Everyone was simply glad they had something they could attach their talents to.  And that is what I felt was missing.....a mature and well concieved story that extends and pays homage to the fall of the would be King."	3.0	Between the lines of a script	2005-11-05	8	5	3

I sat thru the first prequels, as poor as they were, and still came to see this one.  Sadly, Revenge of the Sith is certainly worse even than those last two Star Wars episodes.It's not necessarily the acting that sinks Sith, despite some truly awful dialogue and directing.  Hayden Christenson actually comes off much better than in the last film, and Ewan McGregor appears to have grown so into Obi-Wan that you feel he is almost channeling the great Alec Guinness.  Ian McDiarmid gives a fully competent if never quite outstanding performance as Palpatine/Darth Sidious/The Emperor.  For his little part, digital Yoda steals his every scene. Only Natalie Portman gets stuck holding the brown water with some truly horrific lines and hairdos (people in the audience were laughing out loud at her final desperate pleas with ""Ani"").  What happened to Ling Bai and Keisha Castle-Hughes?  I must have blinked and missed them.  And 83 year old Christopher Lee must be saying deja vu after his early turn to stage left.What really sinks Sith are simply poor fundamental production values.  The editing and pacing are painfully awkward and the film just feels woefully unsubstantial.  Too many cast members are misplaced or underutilized (Chewbacca and his wookie friends might as well not even be there, same for C-3P0; Jimmy Smits and Samuel L. Jackson feel like tokens; plus the problems with Dooku, Ling Bai, and Hughes mentioned above).  Portman's acclaimed line about how ""liberty dies"", however profound the insight, played like a graceless outtake.  The lightsaber battles seem to have lost the magic of previous movies.  Even compared with the first prequel (when Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan fought Darth Maul), the magic is totally missing from these duels.  It might have something to do with the score, the greatest strength of the first trilogy.  Has John Williams gone to the dark side?  This is not a Star Wars caliber score.  Speaking of the dark side, Anakin's turn begins well but ultimately is far from convincing.  It just isn't written well.  Finally, the second prequel began to develop a fairly sophisticated plotline regarding the manipulative devices employed in the erosion of liberty.  The intelligent plot turns ended there; Sith's storyline is so thin and obvious that any sharp eight-year-old should catch all the nuance in one viewing.What surprised me was all the critical acclaim Sith received.  While I normally shout conspiracy, I think a different factor was employed here: thunderous applause for Emperor Lucas.  Which film critic wants to step in front of the war machine?  Be branded a Star Wars-hater by thousands of fanatic dwebes?  Better to just politely clap.  Siskel is certainly turning over in his grave.  The Republic is dead, hail Emperor Lucas.

This is one of the worst films I have seen in my entire life.  It wasn't just a dumb action movie like Episodes 1 and 2.  It was worse.  It was a movie that tried to be good, and in so doing brought itself down even further.  This movie tries to be dark and interesting, like The Empire Strikes Back.  Trying to make this movie dark is one of the funniest things I have ever seen a movie do.  But don't get me wrong.  This movie does not fall into the category of ""it's so bad it's good"".  I absolutely hate this movie.  The biggest problem I had with this movie: Hayden Christensen.  The guy cannot act, not that the movie would have been much better if his performance had been mesmerizing.  The Script is terrible.  We get one mindless plot contrivance after another.  There was no way that this could logically be set up for Episode 4.  So they had to write the script in whatever way they could to make what they needed to happen happen.  The characters and their motivations make absolutely no sense.To be fair, the movie has probably the best opening of any Star Wars movie.  Even though I hate this movie, this opening sequence was stunning.  I like it when a movie opens up with a bang and goes from there.  I went to the midnight showing of this movie, and it was my first time doing that (I do it all the time now).  I was afraid I was going to fall asleep.  The first twenty minutes or so jolted my out of my seat and kept me awake for the whole movie, something that should never have happened, given how awful the rest of the movie was.  This was in direct contrast to the opening of Episode 2, where they crawled along at a snail's pace.  But once that scene ends, the plot has to ensue.  The Republic is very close to winning the war.  With Count Dooku dead, they seem about to win the war.  They must capture General Grievous, who for some reason is a character.  Grievous just seemed so unnecessary.  They didn't need to add in another character, although that fight between he and Obi-Wan was pretty cool.  We then realize that Chancellor Palpatine has been in office for about thirteen years.  It is never really stated how long a term as Chancellor is supposed to be, only that the Senate demanded that he stay in office.  It has taken the Jedi this long to realize that something is seriously wrong regarding the Chancellor.Anakin is very close to the Chancellor, so the Jedi ask him to basically spy on the Chancellor.  The Chancellor asks Anakin to be his representative on the Council.  The council agree, because it will serve their purpose nicely.  However, they do not make Anakin a Master.  Anakin throws his bottle across the room and throws a tantrum.  Although for some reason the expression on his face doesn't change.  At all.  Meanwhile, Padme is pregnant because these two irresponsible sixteen-year-olds got married.  Anakin is overjoyed because Naboo offers tax deductions for a new child, and the kid will be a gold mine.  Wait, no, he is happy because.....WHY???  Why is he happy that a kid is about to be born, who will make their marriage impossible to hide anymore?  Yes, I understand that it is exciting to be a new parent, but shouldn't he be a little more concerned with how this is going to affect their lives?  Then Anakin starts to have dreams that Padme dies in childbirth.  He becomes obsessed with saving her.  He and the Chancellor get into a conversation about the dark side vs. the good side and Palpatine lets slip that he is a Sith and his master, Darth Plagueis, had the power to keep people from dying.  Anakin does not pick up the fact that Palpatine is a Sith, because Anakin is a moron.  Just like every good guy in this trilogy.  I mean, in the previous movie, Count Dooku told Obi-Wan that a Sith Lord was controlling the Senate.  Well, the person controlling the Senate is the Chancellor.  And Palpatine is the Chancellor.  And they still haven't figured it out.  Similarly, Palpatine is telling Anakin about a Sith Lord, a story Anakin has never heard before.  Anakin doesn't bother asking Palpatine where he heard the story, he just sits there and listens.  It isn't until a few scenes later that Palpatine comes out and says ""I'm the Sith lord, you moron,"" that Anakin reports this to the council.Anakin is conflicted, because he is not sure whether the Chancellor can really help him to save Padme's life.  He ends up taking the Chancellor's side, like the back-stabbing little brat he is.  Mace Windu and three other Jedi Masters are killed, and Anakin becomes Palpatine's apprentice.  Remember, he wanted to save Padme's life, so he turned to the dark side.  This is his one and only motivation for turning bad.  Meanwhile, in a subplot that really did not need take the thirty minutes it took to unfold, Obi-Wan kills Grievous.  As they are close to winning the battle, his clone troops turn on him and he barely escapes with his life.  All over the different battlefields, many other Jedi are killed by their troops.  This scene is supposed to be dramatic and sad, but to me it is just stupid.  The Jedi die victims of their own stupidity.  They knew that the clone army had been created illegally and without authorization.  They should have disbanded the clone army, not used it and surrounded themselves with the clones.  When I first saw this movie, I thought Palpatine was a genius for coming up with this way of killing the Jedi.  But now, I don't see Palpatine that way.  I see the Jedi as complete idiots, and Palatine as someone of average intelligence.  It didn't take much brainpower to outsmart these guys.  Obi-Wan and Yoda, at this point the only two Jedi whose names we know, are coincidentally the only ones to escape.  They formulate a plan to kill Anakin and Palpatine, who they have now decided to call ""The Emperor"".  Anakin has been sent to Mustafar to kill the Viceroy and the rest of the Separatist officials.  Padme goes to meet him.Let me pause to talk about the character of Padme.  In episode 1, I liked her a lot.  In episode 2, she was okay, I guess.  The relationship between her and Anakin was really forced.  The plot needed them to fall in love, so they fell in love.  Natalie Portman did not do a bad acting job, she was just playing the role she was given.  Here, Padme is just unbearable.  Once again, Portman is just playing the role she has been given.  And that role sucks.  In the previous movie, Padme's boyfriend tells her that he thinks they should live under a dictatorship instead of a Democracy.  He also displays contempt for his authority figures, especially Obi-Wan.  Last but not least, he committed genocide.  He killed women and children.  Padme's response was to hug him and tell him that ""to be angry is to be human.""  Padme knew when she married him that he was a mass murderer and he had treasonous ideas.  When she learns that he has turned to the dark side, she spouts lines like ""I don't believe what I'm hearing"" or ""You've changed"" or ""You're going down a path I can't follow.""  Anakin is acting as he always has, a traitorous, immature little sith.  Padme, he already went down this path, and you did follow (because the plot required you to).  Obi-Wan shows up, and for some reason Anakin assumes that Padme brought him there so Obi-Wan could kill him.  If that were the case, Obi-Wan would have come out of the ship at the same time she did, not come out of the ship ten minutes after she did.  Anyone with half a brain would have assumed that Obi-Wan stowed away aboard her ship.  Which is what happened.  Then Anakin becomes angry and force-chokes Padme.  His one and only reason for turning to the Dark Side was so he could save Padme's life.  Then for some reason he yells ""you turned her against me!"" at Obi-Wan.  Anakin and Obi-Wan then have a long, long CGI fueled lightsaber duel, which culminates in Anakin getting his limbs removes and catching on fire.  Rather than doing the humane thing and putting Anakin out of his misery, Obi-Wan just stands there and says ""you were my brother, Anakin.  I loved you.""  Obi-Wan is one of the few characters I like in this trilogy, but this scene makes no sense.  Obi-Wan stands there and watches his best friend burn, then just walks away and leaves him to his pain.Meabwhile, Yoda has had a fight with the Emperor.  There is no real suspense, since we already know that both of them are going to survive.  `Cause they are both in the original trilogy.  Yoda fails, but manages to escape.  He and Obi-Wan discover the thing with the twins, Padme gives birth, blah blah blah......they're trying to set the stage for episode 4, you see.  They send Luke to live with his aunt and uncle on Tatooine.  They decide not to change his last name, on the grounds that doing so would help him stay hidden from the Empire in later years.  Leia gets adopted by Senator Organa.  Vader learns of Padme's death, and is horrified.  So he takes his revenge on the Emperor, who manipulated him into betraying his friends, all for nothing.  Oh wait, that's not what happens.  That's what would have happened if this plot made sense.  Vader and the Emperor begin work on the Death Star.  It takes them about twenty years to complete, since they have just finished by the start of Episode 4.  Even though it only took them three years to be halfway done rebuilding it in Return of the Jedi.  So now everything is in place.  Everything is where it needs to be for the original trilogy to make sense.  Except that the movie's plot which put everything in its place was nothing more than one plot contrivance after another.Revenge of the Sith is loved by some, and hated by others.  It is usually considered an improvement over the two previous movies.  I have no idea why.  Episodes 1 and 2 were just dumb action movies.  They were no worse than being dumb action movies.  Revenge of the Sith was not just a dumb movie.  It was a dumb movie that tried to be good.  The only way Lucas could make this movie match up with the original films was to create a series of plot contrivances to make it all come together.  This movie is no better that Episode 1 and 2, and took itself way too seriously.The End"	1.0	Worst Star Wars movie by far	2010-03-27	13	5	8

I can't say how much I hate this film, its completely unconvincing. Its failure is on a galactic scale.  This film is as bad as Jupiter is a big planet.

But after giving this movie a couple of viewings it's a real snoozefest. The casting and mishandling of the transition of Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader was disgraceful. Hayden Christensen was very good in Attack of the Clones, but in this he was a big P U. Brian Thompson should have taken over the role. I wonder if he auditioned and George Lucas was too stupid not to cast him. Also I would not have killed Christopher Lee's character off at the beginning. A Darth Vader vs Count Dooku lightsaber dual would have been an awesome way to end the movie.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2NZ5JBK1LYFDZ	Jackson Bailey	"For countless weeks leading up to the release of ""Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith"", children were the primary target of George Lucas' promotional machine.  There wasn't a kids' channel or cereal box that didn't seem to carry with it a tie-in to the third episode in the Skywalker family saga.  Yet as any shrewd marketing whiz knows, if children are the target of advertising, by extension their parents, their classmates, and their classmates' parents will receive what I like to call ""second-hand P.R.""  It means that I get a dose of advertising as well, except it comes in the more lethal form of constant badgering; ""Buy me the new Star Wars toy"" or ""Take me to the new Star Wars movie.""It's this last request that I find most troubling.  Approximately a week and a half prior to the release of ""Revenge of the Sith"" George Lucas announced that the film is not for children.  Well, thanks a lot George.  By that time the dark side of the Lucas force had already permeated my home, and my children were drowning in the Star Wars advertising onslaught.  Nevertheless I paid heed to Mr. Lucas' warning and viewed the film without my kids in an effort to determine whether or not they should see it.The verdict: definitely not.  This is not a film for children under 10 years of age.  The violence and graphic images in ""Sith"" are more closely related to ""The Godfather"" or ""Goodfellas"" than the happy-go lucky original 1977 episode we all remember so fondly.And sitting in the darkened theatre watching the flickering images of episode III, I realized that Darth Lucas had pulled a second fast one.  Regardless of whether or not this new film was any good, I had to see it.  We all have to see it.  We don't have a choice.  Lucas made sure of that when we watched those first swashbuckling images of Luke, Han Solo, and Princess Leia.  If we want to reconnect in a new way with the characters we grew to love almost 30 years ago, ""Sith"" was billed as the way to do it.  ""Watch this film,"" we were promised, ""and you'll be given the secrets of the entire Star Wars saga.""Darth Lucas certainly delivered on that promise, although like all Star Wars films I was forced to sit through an amateurish plot structure and piss-poor acting... at least on the part of Hayden Christensen, who plays Anakin Skywalker, and Natalie Portman as Senator (formerly Queen) Padm&eacute; Amidala (yet no fault of her own since this very talented actress is forced to play little more than a story-driving, utilitarian character).  However, on second thought, despite Christensen's mugging for the camera as a substitute for real emotion, his acting has improved since ""Attack of the Clones"", but alas his talent continues to make Mark Hamill look like Marlon Brando.On the flip side, Ian McDiarmid is deliciously evil in his over-the-top portrayal of Emperor Palpatine and Ewan McGregor is spot-on with his Alec Guinness Obi Wan.This installment informs the 1977 film in several ways.  First we now know why C-3PO and R2-D2 never spill the beans to Luke and Leia about their past... especially since the droids were there through it all.  We also know why Darth Vader is forced to wear the helmet, and why Leia's last name is Organa and not Skywalker.  All the result of a very exciting -- albeit technically flawed -- climax that is sure to leave audiences on the edge of their seat.However, some of the saga's more crucial points are still left hanging.  For example, we don't know who Anakin's father is, and we're only left to guess if Senator Palpatine had once been a Jedi Knight... the same Jedi who ordered the creation of the clone army.  ""Sith"" also creates new questions, such as, ""What's the necessity of even having Chewbacca in this film?""  The Wookie's presence in this episode has zero impact on the storyline nor on what is to follow in the subsequent three installments.Yet, all in all, I'll likely be back in the theatre for a second viewing... maybe even a third.  I'll also sit down with my kids when they're 10-years-old and watch the DVD with them.  Like Darth Siddious, Darth Lucas knew what he was doing all those years ago when he first set things in motion with that simple little sentence, ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...""  He must have dreamed that we would one day all bow to the dark force of his marketing know-how and buy into his final Star Wars film even if it wasn't all that good."	4.0	I'VE SEEN THE SITH LORD...

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3VV6LTPZDB73W	Jack Stargrave	Why? It's so bad. There is so much CGI that the whole experience is like watching a 2 1/2 hour videogame with terrible cutscenes. What's wrong with sets? I liked sets. CGI hasn't reached the level where it can perfectly mirror reality, so why use it? If you can tell its not real by looking at it, then don't use it (or at least don't film 90% of the film with it). It should only be used for touch-ups, etc., like George Lucas did in the Special Editions of the original trilogy (which I love!!!!). Model space ships looked real. The camerawork was so good it didn't matter if the spaceships were six inches long. Now Star Wars has devolved into some poorly written Pixar flick.Nevermind all the continuity thats been destroyed by these quantum leaps in special effects, what about the acting? It's terrible. Even Natalie Portman's bad and she's a great actress. When Anakin is finally made into Darth Vader (costume and all) he's so lame! He basically whines and rips some things off the wall with the Force because Padme's dead. Even though this is an improvement over the last film, its still nowhere near original trilogy caliber.	1.0	Why do so many people love this film?	2005-05-24	21	12	9
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2KTUL1TPTGWIX	"Jack Treese ""Jack"""	"After 28 long years of box office success, the Star Wars saga has finally reached its end.  In 1977, George Lucas would release a film that has been considered to be the most successful film series of all time.That film was called ""Star Wars.""In recent years, buffs may recall the release of two prequels that were a little less than ""glorious.""  Those prequels were Episodes I and II, titled ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones,"" respectively. (Reviewer's note: My reviews for all of the  Star Wars films begin tomorrow, starting with ""The Phantom Menace"" and ending with ""Return of the Jedi."")The last prequel, and last film in the saga, was released last Thursday, reeling in what I could imagine to be well over $100 Million by now.Once again, I must stress this point out:  This review will contain several spoilers, as I will be going in-depth with this review.The Clone Wars are ending after three years.  Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor), now a Jedi Master, has been sent by the Republic to bring down Separatists Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and Droid General Grievous.  However, Obi-Wan and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker (Christensen) have learned a horrid secret--Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDarmid) is corrupt and Coruscant is under attack!In the beginning dog fight, there is a wild, engaging dogfight where we learn Obi-Wan and Anakin are trying to rescue Palpatine, who has been captured by Count Dooku.  When Obi-Wan is knocked out of battle by Dooku, Anakin fights him to the death until Dooku is brought down and killed by Anakin.  This is where the corrupt mind of Palpatine comes into play.Anakin is growng closer and closer to the dark side of the force.  Little by little, Palpatine brings the Republic to an Empirical regime, and as Obi-Wan takes off to go after Grievous, Palpatine requests to speak with Anakin several times.  He becomes closer to Palpatine, but while getting closer, he has nightmares of his pregnant wife-in-secret, Senator Padme Amidala (Portman), dying during childbirth.However, as Anakin gets closer to Palpatine and his teachings, he reveals to Anakin that he knows the force--and the ways to the dark side and how to use it to advantage.  Anakin reports this to the Jedi Council, and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) places Palpatine under arrest.  Palpatine is captrivated by the dark side, and fights Mace Windu in battle.Anakin arrives in time to see Palpatine down on the ground, wickedly old-looking because of the dark side.  Anakin obeys Palpatine's order over Mace's orders--and Mace Windu dies in glory, in an attempt to save the Republic.Anakin is in a panic, knowing he has broken the Jedi code by killing another Jedi.  So Palpatine offers a chance to teach and train Anakin the ways of the dark side.  Anakin bows down and accepts.  He is dubbed ""Lord Vader.""As a code to all of those of the dark side, the Jedi begin to drop like flies until only two good Jedi are left:  Yoda (Frank Oz), and Obi-Wan.  Yoda feels a strong disturbance within the Force, and sees visions of Anakin joining the dark side. Obi-Wan doesn't believe it, until he sees it on the recorded security holograms.  Padme is heartbroken by hearing it as well.Kenobi has no choice at this point but to face Anakin--who has been like a brother to him--and fight him to destroy the evil inside.And through all of this, Palpatine crowns himself Emperor and gets rid of the old Republic and begins a new Galactic Empire.All I can say is this is the most intense of the Star Wars films, and the most mature.  The movie blends drama, suspense, and the same ol' Galactic fighting we are used to.There's even some familiar faces from past films, including a brief screen second of Jar-Jar Binks.  We also see Chewbacca, with Peter Mayhew proudly returning to the screen once more.And who could forget, Darth Vader?MOVIE NOTE:  When I said this is the most intense of the Star Wars films, I meant it.  This is a Star Wars film more well-suited for the 13 and older crowd.  Maybe I'm just exaggerating.FINAL THOUGHT: When the film began, people stood up and cheered.  It was cool!  Hoever, I found myself in tears in the last half hour.  Not only because of the movie, but because of the fact that this is it, there's no more new Star Wars.  So thank you, George Lucas, for the excellent films, and goodbye forever, Star Wars!"	5.0	Superior to the other prequels (SPOILERS AHEAD)	2005-05-22	7	5	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2VA8I8MCMN2HH	Jacob	Having seen and been subsequently disappointed by the previous two prequels, I went into the theater expecting to be just as let down this time. However, this prequel actually seems to live up to the name of Star Wars. It's full of action from beginning to end, and there finally seems to be a fully defined story and plot. There aren't any surprises involving how things will turn out, of course, but there are surprises in how it happens. The script was, for the most part, quite well done, except for the romantic dialog of course. You think the love scenes in Attack of the Clones were bad? Just wait until you see these. Fortunately, there isn't too many of them. Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader wasn't quite what I expected, and happened much quicker than I imagined. We finally understand why the Jedi were forbidden to marry--this is at the core of Anakin's tragic transformation, actually. Speaking of Anakin, he was portrayed as well as possible given the actor playing him--Hayden Christensen. Come on! I was rather hoping they'd ditch him after Episode II, since he doesn't seem to be able to play the role of Anakin Skywalker very well. He does better this time around, but not by much. However, Palpatine a.k.a Darth Sidious was probably the best character in the movie. He shows his evil clearly in the first scene we see him in, and we see his evil throughout. Whereas before he seemed to be merely a manipulative political figure--though we all knew differently--his true character is revealed in all its dark side glory in this movie. TheThe movie did have its faults, though. There seemed to be too much story squeezed into too small a space. I actually didn't see why the battle at the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk was there at all, since it wasn't even focused on all that much. I would've preferred to see a bit more of Anakin's transformation which, while well done, is quite abrupt and seems to happen just a bit too quickly. Another problem I had was the death of Count Dooku. While he most certainly had to die, I thought he was killed off a bit too quickly. He was one of the major villains in Episode II, now in this one he's dead within the first fifteen minutes or so. Another problem was General Grievous--couldn't they think of a better name for him? Anyone who reads the Star Wars novels or watched the cartoons will know who he is, but those who haven't would definitely be wondering where he came from and what his purpose is. In fact, he seems to have very little purpose in the movie, apart from drawing Obi-wan away from Anakin so that Palpatine can continue his dark side teachings. Indeed, it is while Obi-wan is on a mission to search and destroy Grievous that Anakin's ultimate transformation occurs. Other than that, he seemed to have very little in the way of added value to the movie. Another flaw is the Jedi purge. In A New hope, Obi-wan describes it as the Emperor and Darth Vader hunting down and destroying them. However, there is little hunting down needed. The clone troopers have a code signal that makes them turn on all of the Jedi, and it comes so unexpectedly that the Jedi are all but eliminated within the span of about ten minutes. Anakin, or should I say Vader, goes to the Jedi temple and calmly slaughters all within--seriously, was there no one there who could at least try to fight him? If the Jedi are such formitable warriors, how could they all be eliminated just like that? It didn't make much sense to me.Over all quite good, with some minor flaws, and probably the only prequel that I'd ever watch again from beginning to end.	4.0	Better than I expected	2005-05-19	8	5	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A16YCLRKOU0EV3	Jacob Joseph	"In my opinion, this is the best of the six. I would rate them 3, 5, 2, 6, 4, 1. Ian McDiarmind gives an incredible performance as Palpatine, the scene where he mutates and the battle with Yoda are my favorite parts. General Grievous was also pretty cool. The special features were great, I'm just mad they cut out the scenes dealing with the Rebel Alliance and Yoda's arrival at Dagobah. Also, that scene on Dagobah was originally going to have Qui-Gon's spirit appearing to Yoda, telling him he'd teach him and Obi-Wan how to use this power at the moment of their death, hence, the reason Kenobi and Yoda disappear when they die. Unfortunately, Liam Neeson broke his leg so it was never filmed. But I don't see why that stopped them, given all the special effects now. I also wish they would have had scenes where Tarkin talked. But overall, this is the greatest of the six movies, well worth the wait, I personally like both trilogies,  and I am not cynical like many other Star Wars ""fans.""

I was born after the originals were released, so I was never a part of the ""culture"" that Star Wars is. I saw them when I was around 13 or 14 and fell asleep before the end of all three. I never had the desire to really see them again until Phantom Menace came out. I didn't see it in theaters, but I watched it, liked it, and waited for the next one to come out. I liked Episode II a lot better (I have to admit that half of that appreciation is because I love Hayden), but I still didn't really ""get"" Star Wars. Well, I saw the trailer for the third film, and I thought it looked really good. I also thought it was going to be sad, but I didn't realize that I was going to cry all the way home from the movie theater! After the experience of seeing Episode III, I now finally understand what Star Wars is all about, and I love it! This movie perfectly ties the two trilogies together. It is so emotionally powerful. I know a lot of people say that George Lucas can't write diologue and can't direct anything but action scenes, but I completely disagree. Though some lines are a bit corny, each scene is treated with a tremendous amount of care and sets up your emotions so that you react to ""certain sad circumstances"" in a very personal way. I have watched all three of the first series since seeing Episode III, and I appreciate them so much, because now I understand!

It is the SAME as I and II, and is more over the top than the Phantom and Clones.  When I heard that Spielberg did some of the action sequences, I knew it.  Look at the ending scenes, they sum it all up.  When discussing the light saber duel between Obi-Wan and Anakin, the powers that be are were probably sitting around a table saying, OK, we will have them fighting an exciting light saber duel!  But, then maybe we should have some volcanoes in the background, yeah! and they should be erupting!  But then we should have the lava and rocks falling down all around them!  But then we should have RIVERS of molten lava flowing all over, and then we should have Obi-Wan and Anakin floating on little hover-discs above the flowing lava!!! YEAH!!!  And they should be jumping from disc to disc!!! HELL YEAH!!!! They just don't know when to stop, they're ADDICTED to special effects, pure and simple. Yes, I know Mr. Lucas says Hey, they are kids movies, I understand that, but these three new ones didn't do much for me, I personally feel part II was the best of the new ones (insert your incredulous comments here).  Let it suffice to say, these news ones don't hold a light to the original three.  And, if Jedi would have had Wookiees instead of little teddy bears--uh--I mean Ewoks, then the three original films would be 100% perfect.  Long live Star Wars!

Altenbernd	"Yes, it's not wise to review a movie before it has been released, but let's look at the track record of the prequels for one moment. Honestly, Phantom Menace and AOTC were awful. You would better enjoy these movies more if the audio was shut off and you just listened to the music. The dialogue suggests it was written by a first-year screenplay writer - and that's being kind.The three biggest failures of Lucas doing these pictures are:1. Lucas hasn't directed a movie for over ten years when he did PM and it shows.2. Lucas has lost the ""indie"" movie feel of the originals to a more antiseptic-corporate version.3. He can't direct actors!!! They even say it themselves in the ""Empire of Dreams"" documentary. He would rather have no actors and just use CGI characters like Jar-Jar.He's too concerned about the effects and doesn't care about the actors or the story. He should have spent more time with the story and less time playing with the toys. Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, and Samuel Jackson are wonderful actors. But, when you see them in these movies you cringe because they're awful. How can that be? Easy - bad direction. My guess is they did one or two takes and Lucas said ""print"".Most people agree that ""Empire Strikes Back"" was the best of the original three. Why? Easy. Lucas didn't direct it. Hello?So, how can Episode Three be any better? It can't. Lucas has unfortunately put himself into a trap that he somehow must tie up all the loose ends in 2  hours.Granted, I hope I'm wrong. It would be nice to see something fresh and new from Lucas besides a CGI effect. But, I'm not holding my breathe."	2.0	The Lost Hope	2004-09-14	42	18	24

Amal West ""Jay West"""	Truth is folks by now if u think the first star wars trilogy was the greatest thing since the dawn of man,  most likely your going to find somethign bout the episodes 1-3 that just wont sit right with u,  however if u below the age of say, 24,  and are fairly new to all 6 films u may be somewhat impressed with all the special effect yet find  the episodes 4-6 kinda clunky,  . well i hate to break it to u folks but YES the original star wars film looks cheap,  YES return of the jedi does begin to drag once the ewokes come into the picture, YES a big reason why empire strikes back is held as the best of the entire bunch is because Lucas was no where near the director's chair. YES phantom menace feels more like it was meant for lil kids, but hey guess what sci-fi geeks, so was episode 4, or is it because ur now all grown up and just moved out of ur parents basement that u thought Lucas should now tailor HIS story to suit ur taste, these films were always meant for lil kids, as well as those adult who just like a decent shoot em up sci-fi flick. Now with that said YES revenge of the sith  is the best of new trilogy, or bout as good as it good be with dear ol geogre directing. I mean for a guy who can come up with a pretty decent space opera and run a multi-medioa empire (darth lucas perhaps?) the guy cant write dialogue to save his life, but thankfully that does really matter once anikan finally turns over to the dark side and all sith breaks loose. and say what u want bout the new films but the final showdown between obi-wan and anikan will half to go down as the best lightsaber dual of them all and that alone makes it worth all the jar jar binks in the world  BUY THE DAMM DVD	4.0	WHAT MORE IS THERE TO SAY	2005-12-23	4	1	3

Leai says yes, ""She was very beautiful... but sad.""  Luke responds by saying, ""I have no memory of my mother.  I never knew her.""  So, if Padme dies in child birth, how could this be possible.  Both children only had a few fleeting seconds with their mother, and yet the more Force sensitive of the 2 doesn't remember her.  I'm looking at the prequel trilogy as revisionist history.  It's like any glossy Hollywood biography of a great individual (in this case, Anakin Skywalker).

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3F3B6HY9RJI04	James Duckett	"I was so excited to see this movie that not only did I make it to the midnight showing the morning it opened, I actually read the book beforehand to find out how it all comes together.Ultimately, every aspect of this movie exceeded Lucas' abilities of the past.  The light saber fights were more awesome, the space battles were more incredible, and the emotion was higher than any of his previous movies.  Normally I do a ""Who should see this and who shouldn't"" at the end of my reviews.  Well, forget it this time, you know if you'll want to see it or not.Positives:1)  Special effects.  The second movie was done completely in digital, which was pioneering in its own right.  However, something seemed a bit off.  But which pioneer actually gets it right the first time?  Well, Lucas got it right the second time around.  The special effects in this movie are awesome and untouchable.  No other special effects and FX battles have been this incredible before.  The bar has been raised, as the Star Wars saga has been doing for years, and I don't see this bar being touched for quite some time.2)  Animation.  The only animated character I've seen better than Yoda in this movie was Golum in Lord of the Rings.  Yoda came close, but Golum has him beat.  Yoda needed some breaking in during Star Wars II as that was the first movie he was done without somebody behind him pulling the strings.  But in Star Wars III, you forget he isn't real there just like you did with Golum in Lord of the Rings.3)  Emotion.  The most emotional Star Wars in the past was Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.  This one tops it as you join Anakin's slide into the dark side of the force.  I wasn't one of them, but I've heard of many people crying (and not from the bad dialogue).  Some two or three times!!!  Fasten your seatbelts and expect a ride on the emotional roller coaster.4)  No loose ends.  The link between Star Wars III and IV is done very well, even to the erasing of C3PO's memory.  Very little is left unresolved.  Nicely done, Lucas!5)  Comic Relief.  Despite how dark this movie is there is still some comic relief.  Unfortunately, some of the best lines from the book (which were some of the most humorous) were left out of the movie.  That aside, the comic relief in this episode was actually provided by R2D2.  Thank goodness Lucas didn't think to bring Jar-Jar back into the picture for that.6)  Musical Score:  Every Star Wars movie has had wonderful music and John Williams does not take exception with episode III.  John Williams has been consistently great from day one... this was no exception.Negatives:1)  Bad Dialogue.  Well, what did you expect?  Lucas has always had horrible dialogue (with the exception of American Graffiti) so this shouldn't surprise anybody.  But, of Lucas' work (episodes I-IV), this one has the best dialogue.2)  Romance.  You know, there are some aspects of this film that Lucas should have had ghost-written.  The first is romance.  Star Wars is NOT and never HAS BEEN a romance movie.  The reason why is because Lucas writes it.  This part should have been outsourced as the romance between Anakin and Padme is quite laughable and completely incredulous.3)  Jar-Jar.  The nice thing about this movie is that Jar-Jar doesn't have ONE SINGLE LINE.  So why is this a negative, you might ask?  Because, of all the people who get killed in this movie - JAR-JAR LIVES?!?!?!??  This movie would have been sooo much better if Lord Vader introduced Jar-Jar to the hot side of his light saber.  And then Lucas showing it to us in slow motion five, six, or seven times.  This followed Jar-Jar gurgling as he falls into a messy pulp and pooped upon by a tauntaun.  Yes, yes....4)  Predictable.  Okay, there are no big surprises here because everything was laid out in episodes IV-VI.  But I still wish Lucas had pulled something out of his imagination that would make us think: ""Wow, I never saw that coming.""  I was hoping to learn that Anakin, who had no father, was actually created (fathered) by Palpatine for the sole purpose of making him Lord Vader.Despite the negatives, this puppy still gets five stars.  Mostly from the effort.  But also because the bar has been raised, once again by Lucas, on how Sci-Fi movies should be made.  The special effects are groundbreaking and PERFECT!  Lucas' best work by far (yes, better than episode IV).  Nobody has come close to getting it this right."	5.0	Despite the Imperfections, a Fantastic Movie!!	2005-05-22	4	2	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A35BIKY9HDGC1K	James	Give Peter Jackson or other notable directors the money and task to make this movie and they would have done an infinitely better job.  In fact, give me the money George Lucas wasted on this piece of crap and I can make a better movie.  Pure and simple.I don't want to spend any time criticizing the awful dialog.  I just want to point out serious technical errors on the physics and effects, as well as gaffs in the implementation of warfare strategy in the movie.Star Wars in general is quite simplistic in its view of war and how wars are fought.  The biggest disagreement I have is how battles unfold.  Lucas thinks space wars are fought like opposing armadas of sailing ships, fighting en masse, big guns blazing away from the sides of the ships.  Witness how the battle cruisers pass by each other in the beginning of the movie, firing away from big guns on their sides, dispensing salvos in single shot manner (quite primitive).This is contrary to the evolution of warfare.  As technology evolves, we see an escalation of power and implementation of that power with precision, at great distances.  If Lucas was cognizant of this, battle cruisers would have fought from the other side of the planet, using the planet as cover, perhaps even fighting from opposite sides of the solar system, traveling at light speed utilizing thermonuclear or even antimatter missiles.If the mission was to rescue the chancellor, would it have been better to use a strike team to come in under cover?  The whole battle in the beginning of the movie is essentially implausible if the objective was to primarily rescue the chancellor.  What was the point?  The separatists could have just killed the Chancellor prior to rescue.A serious flaw regarding physics is the pervasive disregard of the fact that THERE IS NO SOUND IN SPACE.  Sound is transmitted through compression and rarefaction of air, and we all know that outer space is void.  Yet we hear the explosions and the roar of the fighter engines.  The fighters move as if they were moving like airplanes; they even have vestigial wings.  If antigravity so liberally applied throughout the movie were true, wings would have been unnecessary.Another gross implementation of primitive warfare is how land battles were fought.  Again clones and droids were fighting en masse, lining up like Brits and Colonists during the American Revolution, facing off in orderly rows.  We all know that modern combat is fought in cover, in rapid succession, with precision engagement.And then there are the light saber battles.  What's up with the jedis twirling their sabers like batons?  It's a total waste of movement.  Does a light saber's blade have mass or is it massless?  If it was massless (and knowing from physics class that light is nearly massless), we should see Jedi moves that exceed our ability to see the blade movements.  The fight would be a big blur.  But this is not the case.  The light saber fights and choreography is painfully slow, as if light sabers were heavy.Yoda, when wielding a light saber, jumps around and looks spectacular, but it is actually a waste of energy.  Additionally, a swordsman who does not have both feet on the ground is at a strategic disadvantage.  The force of the opponent's sword or light saber in this instance will be enough to knock the other opponent off balance if both feet were not firmly planted.  Yoda would have been at extreme disadvantage while jumping around.  He would have been an easy target.Also, what's up with the Wookies?  Was Tarzan's call really necessary?Does Darth Vader's final life support costume really have to be so cumbersome and ugly?  Come on, now, are we expected to believe that such an advanced generation of sentient beings with the most advanced technology available (witness the liberal use of antigravity, interstellar travel, etc.) and utmost regard for aesthetics (e.g. Queen Amidala's ceremonial clothing) not be aware of tissue and limb regeneration, or at the very least live tissue encapsulated prosthetics?Near the end of Star Wars III, the fight between the Anakin and Obi Wan on the volcanic planet bordered on implausibility.  Has Lucas ever been near a flowing lava?  If he did, he would know it is hot, hot, hot.  Standing just 5 feet away from the lava for just a few seconds is what most humans without protective clothing can stand.  The heat radiated by the lava is like standing in front of a blast furnace.  Yet we see both jedi standing on a flotsam in the midst of a lava river for extended periods.  Their clothes, hair and skin should have burned off within the first 10 seconds.  The superheated air should have seared their lungs, making death inevitable within a few minutes.From the home theater side, the sound was disappointing in that much of the explosions are highly compressed.  In fact, the drums heard during the beginning of the movie, as well as during the fitting of the Darth Vader's suit, had more shock and awe than the explosions.  I think most studios are guilty of compression.  Those fortunate (or unfortunate) enough hear a gun, cannon, an explosion, or even a car crash knows the terror of the loud bang.  Yet, when I hear the explosions in the movie, I don't feel shocked or even surprised.  Come on, guys, lay off the compression knob.A good movie to hear good natural explosive effects is Kevin Costner's Open Range, where the gun discharge was often startling.  Even the thunder at the beginning of the movie was shocking in its realism.  In Star Wars, the explosions sound like someone tapping on an empty oatmeal container.For the masses, I suppose these technical oversights are acceptable.  But half the fun of watching a science fiction movie is the plausibility of technical ideas presented by the movie.  If I can't accept an idea because I know better, then the movie is a waste of money, and that's what Star Wars I, II, and III is, a waste of money, resource and talent.	2.0	Awful, Awful, Awful	2005-11-01	6	3	3

And now the film we really have been waiting for Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (2005).We have seen Anakin as an innocent child.

Now this third and final film of this second trilogy is Anakin,now 23, married and with his pregnant wife.  His best pal has become Obi-Wan Kenobi, nicely played by Ewan McGregor who fits perfectly into the role now.  However, the more time Anakin spends with Palatine (Darth Sidious), played again by Ian McDiarmid, the more anger and evilness within him is about to manifest out of him.  He ultimately becomes Darth Vader.In the cast: Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, Christopher Lee, Jay Laga'aia, Jeremy Bulloch, Temuera Morrison, Samuel L. Jackson.

I wanted more.  It was the fastest 2 hours, 20 minutes I've sat though.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A6D6XYJLKQWF4	"Jameson Thottam ""Jameson Thottam"""	"Jameson Thottam Review of Star Wars Episode III, Revenge of the SithThe movie is really like one big family reunion were all the key characters that spawned Luke and Leia come together. While you don't have to have watched the first episode to follow the plot, it might help if you are totally foreign to the Star Wars genre. The films dramatic and brilliant opening will quickly let viewers know why this film made $50 million dollars the first day it was released. The viewer, (i.e., me Jameson Thottam) is literally pulled right into this epic plot, as the film effortlessly updates fans filling in all the gaps as Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) becomes Darth Vadar eventually losing everything he loves including his secret wife Sen. Padm&eacute; Amidala (Natalie Portman) while Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) lives another day so that he can eventually train Luke Skywalker in a previous episode. For the Thottam family, the real mystery is the making of the episodes; where somehow all of the films make sense twenty something years later (My hats off to George Lucas). One of the saddest scenes in the movie is when the Jedi Knights were betrayed and the ""younglings"" were killed.The acting in the film was average as I, Jameson Thottam, felt the movie focused more on cinematography and galactic realism as if that could honestly be accomplished. At times it was if the lines between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman appeared forced and perhaps contrived as this ill fated couples seem to lack cinematic chemistry. The actors that did well in my opinion were veterans like Samuel L. Jackson, and Jimmy Smits. It should also be noted that Ian McDiarmid pulled off a magnificent performance as he represented the dark side. McDiarmid's mannerisms and stalking gesticulation made his role exciting making him the perfect villain. Despite the run of the mill acting, I, Jameson Thottam, really enjoyed this film and think it deserves 4 stars. The costumes, fighting scenes, spacecrafts and the aliens of different races were enough to make a sci-fi fan do cartwheels in the popcorn line. The best and yet saddest scene was the fight between Obi-Wan the master and Anakin who had now turned to the dark side. After watching this scene the questions still lingers, did Anakin choose the dark side because of his childhood? Did he choose the dark side because of fear, or thirst for power?The Thottam family's caution on this film goes to parents with small children. Most of the advertising and merchandise for this film was made and printed when this film was not rated. This film has a lot of material that is inappropriate for young children. There are beheadings of druids and dismemberment of key characters via light saber and a hearty serving of violent action that's definitely unsuitable for young viewers. The PG-13 rating is appropriate, due to the dramatic and dazzling sci-fi violence however, from what I, Jameson Thottam, observed in the theater today, many parents have thrown caution to the wind on this one. Moviegoers will probably have some flash backs to some of the Star Wars TV parodies, especially when the film opens with, ""A LONG time ago in a galaxy far, far away..."" while I think the famous opening is fantastic keeping true to the series, I, Jameson Thottam, also think it has been spoofed an awful lot in other films making it a bit ordinary.Bottom line, Revenge of the Sith is the Picasso of sci-fi films serving as a cinematic masterpiece worth the wait and all of its prior (albeit poor) installments.Was this helpful?Jameson Thottam"	4.0	Jameson Thottam - Review of Star Wars, Episode III	2005-10-11	5	1	4
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1TQBPDIBIWWVG	James Quirk	"Too many reviewers here copycat their material from so-called ""professional film critics"" by being quick to point out either poor performances from Hayden Christensen and/or Natalie Portman, poorly written dialogue, and/or that they're upset with the film because it carries an anti-Bush message. Well, the story was conceived a long time ago (the mid-1970s) in a galaxy far, far away, way before the first George Bush was in office. The story was pre-conceived way before the younger Bush took office, so anyone who believes it carries an anti-Bush message it outright wrong. I'm a fan of our president and he didn't come to mind once while I was watching this film. As for the dialogue, it's ""Star Wars"" for Heaven's sake. I don't remember any Star Wars movie that contained dialogue any different than what is offered here. It's a science fiction fantasy movie!!! As for the performances, I thought Christensen, Portman and everybody else in the film were great. This movie was a return to the form that Lucas mastered with the original trilogy. Then there are those who complain the film is too dark. I don't know what these people were expecting? It's about how Anakin Skywalker is seduced by the Dark Side of the Force and becomes Darth Vader. We all knew this. We knew this before Episode I was released. Revenge of the Sith is brilliant movie-making. Let me be the first to say it - George Lucas deserves a Best Picture nomination for this film, not only because it's a great movie, but also because it's the culmination of a phenomanal run of pictures that started way back in '77. Back then, the original was nominated for Best Picture but lost to ""The Goodbye Girl."" Does anbody even remember the latter? I think I watched five minutes of ""The Goodbye Girl"" on HBO back in the early 80's and shut it off. In short, I liked everything about ""Revenge of the Sith."" I believed Christensen when he told Obi-Wan near the end of the film, ""I hate you!."" Ian McDiarmid's Palpatine/Darth Sidious was the performance of his lifetime. The special effects were the best of any Star Wars film, but served (and rightfully so) as the backdrop to the story and performances.

Does that mean I don't still enjoy them?Anybody that could deny the sheer scope and impact the Star Wars saga has had on modern cinema and popular consciousness, and will continue to have, probably thinks that The Dukes of Hazzard remake is the high point of Western Civilization.Give Lucas his credit. He had a monumental task in front of him to deliver a second trilogy. The last installment, Revenge of the Sith, closes the circle with flourish and power. In this day and age, it's not every day that the Hero of the story turns into a villain, the princess dies betrayed and brokenhearted, and yet at the end we feel reason to hope.

I thought the director spent way too much time explaining Anikan's boy hood that I felt like falling asleep watching that film.  I could not believe that George Lucas would make something this boring!  The sequel to that one was a little better, but I was still a little bit disappointed.  This one ""Rvenge of Sith"" was much much better.  It had basically non-stop action all the way through the movie.  I used to hate the guy who played Anakin, but I thought he was a little better actor in this movie.  The movie did a great job explaining how Anakin became darth vader.  Only part that I didn't really understood was when the doctor who looked over May while she was giving birth said she was in perfect health, but she was slowely dying.  Sith told darth vader that his anger killed May.  I could not believe that a mother would want to die of heartbreak rather then stay alive to take care of her two new born child.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1V2LHLYYXE3UA	Jason Buchanan	From the few bits and pieces of info Lucas has divulged, it's clear that Episode III will either fall over trying to rekindle the Star Wars magic or revitalize the saga. When Episode I was released, the general consenus was that it didn't live up to the original trilogy and was therefore deemed a letdown. When Episode II hit theaters, it became apparent that the bar had been significantly raised. But again, it didn't quite capture that intangible feel of Episodes IV, V, and VI. Now with Episode III, the question is whether or not Lucas can rally the troops and restore Star Wars to its former glory. I would say that all signs point to yes. This time around, Lucas has a considerable number of factors working in his favor such as: 1.) With the much anticipated return of Darth Vader, Lucas can bring that nostalgic feel to the film which its predecessors couldn't. 2.) Since the events of ROTS are very close to that of Episode IV, the saga will come full circle and consequently answer all those nagging questions. This will be visible in the changes in the Jedi starfighters which will look remarkably like tie-fighters and the appearance of the clone troopers which will look closer to that of the storm troopers. This is an extension of #1. 3.)There will an epic, uninterrupted lightsaber duel between Anakin and Obi-wan that will last 12 minutes; the longest swordfight in cinema history. (Note: It's said that the way in which Anakin comes out on the short end of the fight is the most chilling moment in the saga). 4.)Instead of that pussy Count Dooku, there will be an actually threatening villian in General Grievious, a droid-alien hybrid. Supposedly, John-Rhys Davis (Gimli from LOTR) will do Grievous' voice. 5.)Episode III is essentially dark in tone and could merit a PG-13 rating. So, with all this in mind there is little room for doubt that Episode III will deliver the goods. Come May I guarantee you that this movie will leave you remembering why you loved Star Wars in the first place.	5.0	The Return of Star Wars As We Knew It	2004-10-19	32	23	9

Once the action starts to unfold ""Sith"" is a non stop assault on the senses of even the most cynical viewer. I thought Ian McDiarmid was superb hamming it up as Palpatine and Hayden Christensen was very convincing as Anakin / Vader. Contrary to what other reviews have said I was genuinely moved at times. Some of the scenes were really quite sad. Minor gripes would be that the tying up of loose ends at the end is rather hurried and the ""Noooo"" is a bit cringeworthy but necessary. It will be a shame if the Star Wars legacy really does come to an end here. I heard that the final three parts might yet still be made based on some of the novels. Rumour has it that part 7 could be based on ""Dante's Last March"". The thing is I think that the first two films proved one thing, a point that was rammed home in Revenge of the Sith - if Vader ain't in it, it probably ain't worth making"	5.0	Bring on part 7....	2005-08-07	12	9	3

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ABX7EFG4OBW4H	"Jaster Mereel ""DarthDooku"""	"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the SithDirected and written by George LucasProduced by Rick McCallumDistributed by 20th Century FoxStarring Hayden Christensen, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Ian McDiarmid, Frank Oz, Samuel L. Jackson, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Jimmy Smits, and Peter Mayhew.Rated PG-13The circle is now complete. All three Star Wars prequels have now been released, and the entire story of the Star Wars saga is now known. This latest entry into the saga, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, chronicles the path of Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi in the Republic, as he follows down a dark path. The film also details the political maneuvering of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Without giving too much away, the Clone Wars, which began in Episode II, are still continuing in this film, with the Separatists seemingly having the upper hand. Meanwhile, Anakin has a premonition from the future which starts to affect him greatly, as the Supreme Chancellor starts influencing the torn and confused mind of young Skywalker.The acting in this film is noticeably better than Episode I and Episode II, particularly from Hayden Christensen. Natalie Portman also gives a better performance here, and both of these performances may be due to the more emotionally involving storyline. Particularly near the end of the film, Christensen gives a compelling performance as a (very) angry Anakin Skywalker. Perhaps the best actor, aside from the ever-consistent Ewan McGregor, is Ian McDiarmid, who portrays Palpatine. McDiarmid goes from frightened to furious in a heartbeat, and his performance is both believable and annoying. Why annoying? You'll see after watching the film!Now, Star Wars has always been known for its mind-blowing visual effects, and Episode III raises the bar even higher than that set by Episode II. We are taken to battles from the Clone Wars, including Utapau and Kashyyk. Both of these battles are filled with images everywhere on the screen, and the action is so intense, it may take a few viewing just to get accustomed to it. In addition, a huge space battle takes place in Episode III, also with so much detail all around, it is initially very intense. Ships are flying everywhere, small droids are buzzing around, and ships are blowing up. There is so much detail for your eyes to process, it's a wonder that it doesn't cause a mental overload! Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) did a fantastic job with these battles. In addition, Yoda looks a lot more textured and realistic than his Episode II rendition, which allows audiences to connect with the character more, which has never been more important in the prequels than in this film. This film, as far as i know, was created almost entirely digital, and some scenes, like those from a volcanic planet, are amazingly well-done for complete CG. In addition, General Grievous is worth particular mention, since some of his scenes involve intense duels that surpass anything seen before in Star Wars. If Episode III doesn't get an Oscar for visual effects, you know something's up with that Academy!The sounds in this film were equally impressive. Ben Burtt, the head of the sounds for the film, obtained a rich tapestry of rumbles, scrambles, screams, explosions, and of course, lots of lightsaber buzzes for this film. The imagery was also beautiful, ranging from a planet covered in fire to one filled with trees and water, and yet another made of rock. The artists really went all out for this film to show the breadth and depth of the Star Wars galaxy as only a conflict like the Clone Wars could show.And now, the plot, the single most important element in the film, in my opinion. George Lucas could have either succeeded greatly or failed completely with this film, there was no middle ground. Fortunately for us, and for him, he succeeded with Episode III, managing to fit a plot worthy of two films into a two and a half hour film.NOTE : MAJOR SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT!!!Lucas manages to bring in many characters from the older films, as well as those from the prequels. Count Dooku makes an important, albeit brief, appearance in the beginning of the film. Lucas loves parallels between the prequels and the original trilogy, and Anakin's duel with Count Dooku, as a ""captured"" Palpatine watches, is very reminiscent of the epic duel in Episode VI. The movie begins with a bang, as General Grievous captures the Supreme Chancellor as war rages on above Coruscant, and the film doesn't quite let you go till the very end.Perhaps the most important area of the film is the seduction of Anakin Skywalker to the Dark Side of the Force. Anakin starts out well: he has a much better relationship with Obi-Wan than what we saw in Episode II, and he is truly in love with Padm&eacute;. This is ultimately his downfall, however, as premonitions of Padm&eacute;'s death, similar to those he had of his mother in Episode II, lead him to believe the consistent lies and persuasions of Palpatine, also known as Darth Sidious, and leads to his fall to the Dark Side. But from this film, one realizes that Anakin is not an evil person; he gave in to emotions just as many people today may very well do, and in an effort to save the people he loved, he grew so angry and hateful that he caused his own suffering in the end. Anakin would not even listen to Obi-Wan Kenobi in their fateful duel on the fiery world of Mustafar, yet even after he becomes more machine than man at the end of the film, his main concern is still about Padm&eacute;. As a friend mentioned, Episode III shows how easy it is for people to be seduced to the side of evil, to the side of wrongdoing, by giving in to emotions and feelings. Anakin, and Darth Vader, are shown not to be evil, but tragic. You feel sorry for Anakin by the end of this film, and Lucas does a great job in portraying that.However, one character that you do not feel sorry for in this film is Palpatine, revealed to be the Sith Master, Darth Sidious. Palpatine orchestrated a plan since the time of Episode I and Episode II, as he turned the Senate on his side by orchestrating a galaxy-wide conflict. Then, in this film, he turns the Jedi from protectors to enemies of the Republic, and in a stunning scene, he orders the clone troopers to attack the Jedi, their former allies. Meanwhile, Palpatine also seduces Anakin to become Darth Vader, and utilizes him to defeat the unwary Jedi at the Jedi Temple, and later to eliminate the Separatist leaders. Palpatine orchestrates a master plan for galactic domination, and the fruits of his victory form the core storyline of Episode III. George Lucas makes us admire yet hate Palpatine at the same time, and when combined with the superb acting of McDiarmid, Lucas makes Episode III the strongest film of the prequel trilogy.NOTE : END OF MAJOR SPOILERS!!!One important thing to note, however, is that Episode III would not be nearly as good without the plot elements in the other two prequel films, as they laid the foundation for many of the events that transpire in this film. Thus, although many do not enjoy the prequels, after seeing Episode III, it is evident that much of it is interconnected with the other films, and when taking the saga as a whole, all these interconnections helps form a rich and complex tapestry. The first two prequel films, despite their extreme critical disapproval, are actually strong, engaging films that ultimately have a very important purpose to them. So, if you are one of those people who can't stand the prequels, try watching Episode III and giving the other two a try again.... i bet you'll like them a lot better!In short, Episode III is definitely worth your ten dollars at a movie theater. Seeing the film in any other way is doing a disservice both to you and to Lucasfilm, since the effects and sounds in this film simply have to be experienced in a theater. Even if you haven't seen a single Star Wars film, Episode III is a very enjoyable experience, you can just sit there and be wowed by the special effects! So if possible, check it out, and you will realize that the Force is truly with this last installment in the epic Star Wars saga."	5.0	The Circle is Now Complete	2005-07-25	6	5	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2NWDRRFU1YJ8	"Jayne Mcclure ""Dangerosa"""	"""We Shall nor cease from exploration, and at the end of our Exploring, we shall arrive at the same place...and know it for the first time"" T.S. Elliot ""Little Gidding, IV Four Quartets.My favorite poem. It was used by astronomer Carl Sagan in his 1st book as a dedication, and is equally fitting as a description of George Lucas epic vision. Lucas has done a beautiful thing in bringing this mythic tale of innocence, corruption, and redemption to a popular audience of the late 20th/early 21st century (when we sorely need it!). His vision is not in question , his execution is.First  my overview of the series:Ep. I ""Phantom Menace"" .....1star ( if this was the begining, it would have ended here.)EpII ""Attack of the Clones"".....2 1/2 stars (I actually liked a lot of this movie. If it hadn't of been""Star Wars"" as a Sci-Fi movie I'd have rated it 3stars.Ep. III ""Revenge of the Sith"".....3 1/2 stars again, if it wasn't ""Star wars"" it's a four star. Great Sci Fi, but not quite up to SW standards.Ep. IV ""A New Hope"" ........5 stars. Totally amazing. Great story, humor, and even with 1977 technology completley blew away all other sci-fi, western good-evil dicotomy movies.Ep. V ""Empire Strikes back"".... 5++++stars. Couldn't believe it, a sequel that was not just the equal, but surpassed the original. This one brought us into  the grown up world of shades of grey, and how can a good man (woman, person) descend from Grace to decadence.Ep. VI ""Return of the Jedi"".....4 1/2 stars. OK 1/2 star reduction for the cutsie-poo Ewoks. And would have been less for the tepid resolution of the Han/Leia romance, except that with Harrison/Carrie the sexual chemistry was good enough to carry it off.When viewed as an entire series, from start to finish, these 6 movies will be the classic literature of the late 20th/early 21st century. They touch a chord that deep, on a par with Homer's Illiad/Odessy.My review of Ep. III alone is a bit more problematic. The vision is epic, the execution is flawed. The special effects are state of the art (when have they not been on SW), sometimes to the detriment of the story. Yes, some of the writing is hokey,but the real problem in the Prequel series is the lack of PASSION!I never beleived in the romance between Aniken and Padme, and that is the linchpin to believing in his descent to the darkside.Aniken needs to portray an all-consuming, OBSESSIVE (caps no mistake), passion for his love to make it believable that he would become Darth Vader (one of the most passion ridden charactors in the modern ouvre) for her. I don't know if this  is the fault of Lucas writing of the parts, or the acting of the principals. I've seen Natalie Portman in other roles where she excells, so I hesitate to slam her for the lack. Christensen is a LOT better in this one than in ""Clones"", but still is part of the problem.This romance could have (should have) been on the par of Cathy/Heathcliff from ""Wuthering Heights""( see the wonderful 1970 movie with a young Timothy Dalton, and see what  the charactor of Anaiken's descent to Darth Vader should have been.)Some of the story defies logic. Why is it that Grand Master Yoda consistantly fails? In ""Clones' he lets Dooko get away, and he is defeated by Darth Sidious here. Why can't supposedly wise Jedi like Mace Windoo treat a young knight on the brink in a way that will keep him from the darkside.There is however a lot to like in this installment. The performances of veteran actor Ian McDiarmond as the evil emperor/sith master is a classic, and I just wish Christopher Lee was in more of this as Count Dooko. Ewan McGregor is a wonderful young Obi-Wan, he is the best thing about all the prequels, and his pain at his protoge's turning to the darkside is palpatable in the last battle on the volcano. I feel his betrayal, far more than I feel the betrayal of Padme. I also take exception to the fact that Padme dies as a result of her lack of will to live because of Aniken. I could accept her death as a result of her injuries from Aniken's abuse, but she's a new mother..she should want to survive to protect the children of her great love, or at least to preserve the freedom of her cherished republic. It doen't make sense she is so weak as to give up when she has all this to live for.Oh well, kudos to George for bringing this magnificent vision to the screen. I guess for a passionate, obsessive portayal of a masked, disfigured, tortured hero who finds redemption through love, I'll just have to watch my DVD of ALW's ""Phantom of the Opera"" for a satisfying resolution of the myth."	4.0	"""We Shall Not Cease From Exploration"""	2005-05-26	6	2	4

Brittman ""The Bottom Line"""	"While Episode III is the strongest of the Star Wars prequels it still pales in comparison to any of the originals. The storyline is fascinating and almost makes you wonder why we had to sit through two useless build-ups to get us to the meat of the matter. Revenge of the Sith is filled with almost non-stop action, something that Episode II sorely lacked. There are numerous battle scenes, lightsaber duels and chases. Anakin's turn to the dark side is swift and shocking. But, Hayden Christiansen cannot pull off the true anger required of the Darth Vader character, his feeble attempts at glares and his even weaker ""NOOOOOOOOOOOO"" when he learns of the fate of his wife is almost laughable. Ewen MacGregor is the only actor who does a good job here reprising his role as Obi Wan Kenobi. MacGregor has captured Sir Alec Guinness' Kenobi right down to the accent. MacGregor carries Episode III with his stellar performance. Call me old fashioned, but I still prefer the old Yoda puppet to this CGI created Yoda. Yoda does see some action as well versus Darth Siddious in a spectacular battle scene. Chewbacca only graces our presence for about one minute total, which was disappointing. C3PO is thankfully scattered throughout the film but R2D2 plays a bit more prominent of a role. The final scenes just didn't move me as much as I thought they would but nevertheless, Episode III does tie up the saga into a nice neat package. Overall, Revenge of the Sith will still rank behind Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi but far ahead of The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. P.S. Leave the kids home for this one, there's a lot of dark, evil stuff going on. Recommended."	4.0	Strong with the Force this film is...A Classic it is not...	2005-05-26	3	2	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AYOVYQ5THUL96	J. Cecil	"Of course the movie was incredible.  We have been waiting twenty-some years (since ""Luke... I am your father"") to see how all of this gets resolved and now we finally do.  I actually hate to compare one Star Wars film to another at all, and I would be extremely hesitant to ever say that any of them are better than or even as good as the first, since ANH was the original and defined the saga for us, but from a certain point of view (heh heh) it could be said that ROTS is the greatest Star Wars film of them all.  This is based simply on two things:  it has the greatest special effects and the most powerful emotional impact.  Revenge of the Sith is an unforgettable experience.My only criticism is that it could have been longer.  This is not a fundamental flaw, only lighthearted nitpicking.  Lucas seems to be a little too afraid of testing - or ignoring - the limits of the perceived lack of attention span (deserved or not) of today's youth.  Questions of marketing the franchise for the young masses aside, he ought not hesitate to make a film as long as it needs to be, and have faith in his real audience - the true Star Wars fans - to stick with him.  Let's face it:  he is really (or ought to be) making these movies for those of us thirtysomethings who were enthralled by the magic of his epic as children ourselves, and have been with him all along.  Not to say that he hasn't succeeded in being true to this audience; again, this is just friendly nitpicking.  Like any other Star Wars nerd, I would like to have seen Yoda arrive on Dagobah (and learned why there?), to have witnessed the deaths of Shaak Ti, Luminaria Unduli and Barriss Offee, to have seen a little more of a story on Kashyyk rather than just the battle imagery (breathtaking as it was).  I thought Chewbacca was going to be an actual character in the story, not just a cameo.  I would like to have seen much more of that weird planet where the sexy Aayla Secura was gunned down by her troopers (Felucia, I think it is called).  Getting a better look at those crab droids would have been nice.  I would have liked a little explanation of the relationship of the Antilles family to the ruling house of Alderaan.  Maybe for Grand Moff Tarkin to have had some lines.  I was so intrigued by Yoda's last-minute instruction to Obi-Wan regarding his proposed training while in exile upon Tatooine (suggesting an answer to the mystery of why the two of them later bodily disappear at the moment of their deaths whereas Qui-Gon Jinn and other Jedi do not, and are, along with Anakin, able to return as spirits...  Yoda suggests that it is Qui-Gon himself who, beyond death and in oneness with the Force, has discovered this ability to return as his own personality and commune with those who remain in the realm of flesh and ego...  Alas, Jinn does not appear, and Yoda does not explain, only hints).All these things, however, are nonessential to the central story which Lucas, rightfully so, focuses upon:  the reasons for Anakin's fall to the dark side, and the complicated nature of Palpatine's seduction of him interwoven with the grand political machinations that place Palpatine in the position of ultimate power.  I may engage in well-meaning criticism and wistful longing for more detail, but I am certainly not in any way disappointed with this wonderful culmination to Lucas' saga.In fact, I feel the need to say that furthermore I am a little tired of all the people who continue to relentlessly disparage Episodes 1 and 2.  While I agree that 3 is the best of the prequel trilogy, I have to say (though I will be branded a person of no perception, taste or faculty of distinction by such folks) that I think TPM and AOTC were great films.  Everyone is certainly entitled to their own opinion, and of course this is only mine.  It is supposedly `politically correct', even hip, among the Star Wars crowd these days to proclaim that ANH and ESB were the only two great films and that the others have somehow been huge disappointments.  I don't buy it.  I will say it loud and proud:  I enjoy watching the Phantom Menace.  Is Jar Jar Binks my favorite character?  No.  Do I think maybe there could have been a better child actor than Jake Lloyd to play Anakin (or better lines for him)?  Probably.  Do I think sometimes some of the dialogue in some of the Star Wars films is a little corny or cliche?  Yes.  Do I let little details like this ruin great movies for me?  No.  I wholeheartedly agree with another reviewer, Cody Patton of Albuquerque, when he says ""I'm not arrogant enough to actually let (`I-would-have-done-it-this-way'-type complaints) ruin movies for me"".  He said this in reference to just ROTS, but I feel that way about the whole saga.  If you don't enjoy the Star Wars movies, quit griping and just don't watch them.  My advice is to lighten up and enjoy it for what it is, rather than disparage it and write the whole thing off for its inability to live up to some undefined and unattainable golden dream of yours.  It is as if some people have found themselves unable to enjoy Star Wars afresh - that is, to the extent they did as kids - in their adulthood, and rather than look within to measure whether this is valid, they treat it as a predicament necessitating blame, which they level at Mr. Lucas as being somehow `untrue' to his own story.  You are not George Lucas, and you did not create this epic.  Why do you take personal offense that the prequel trilogy was not made to the exacting, maybe unrealistic specifications of some fantasy inside your own mind?  Rather than Lucas having betrayed you, maybe you just don't like Star Wars any more.  It is sort of a childish response to oppose, just out of nostalgia's sake, someone adding to their own story, and that is in effect what a lot of people seem to be doing, even if they claim and believe they are only protesting the manner in which he has done so.  Some people complained about Mark Hamill's whining and Carrie Fisher's overdone accent back then.  The prequel trilogy is part of the same consistent tale as the original trilogy, from this same genius of cinematic wizardry, and not a lesser afterthought in any way.  Sure, episode 4 was and remains a great film for what it did in 1977 that had never been done before.  None of the rest of the films, by definition, can break ground like that.  Does it mean that they can't be great in their own right?  They are all, in my mind, equally important chapters in the same consistent and coherent tale told by the same formidable storyteller.  I love the Empire Strikes Back too, but I don't understand how that movie is supposed to be so hallelujah-almighty greater than the rest.  Supposedly because it is ""darker"" and doesn't have a happy ending.  That's your prerequisite for a good story?  Furthermore I don't understand the opposition to, even squeamishness about, the supposedly cringe-worthy romantic scenes.  What, are you people in fifth grade, that you can't endure a little awkward romance with your spaceships and rayguns?  Okay, so its not exactly Romeo and Juliet.  Yes, some of it is cheesy, corny, canned, saccharine, (whatever adjective you like)...  That's sort of the point.  That's what young lovers, in love for the first time, do.  Those are the kinds of things they say to each other:  things that almost make those who overhear want to vomit.  In fact, anyone who is actually familiar with Romeo and Juliet knows that Shakespeare, too, understood this.  Young lovers think that they are the first to ever feel those emotions.  They say silly, sickeningly-sweet things to one another.  Shakespeare meant for his audiences to sort of chuckle at Romeo and Juliet's starstruck behavior toward one another.  After all, that play was considered a comedy, not a tragedy, even though the lovers (and other people) end up dead at the end as a result of attachment to clandestine love (which makes the events of Verona not too unlike the Star Wars prequel trilogy, doesn't it?).  Also, because of Anakin and Padme's predicament, they don't have the luxury of a more at-ease, drawn-out and maybe (or maybe not) more mature courtship, with the humor and natural rhythm of Han and Leia's.  Padme is a level-headed senator and Anakin a great warrior, but neither of them is wise or cool-headed when it comes to love:  all the worse, ultimately, for the fate of the galaxy.  If there is cliched dialogue, let's not make a mountain out of a molehill.I do suspect many of those folks I disagree with will like ROTS much better than they have some of the others.  After all, it takes the prize for darkness.  And it is a fantastic last puzzle-piece to one of if not the greatest movie epic of our time.  George Lucas may not be Shakespeare, nor is Star Wars supposed to be Citizen Kane, but give the man some credit where credit is due:  the Star Wars epic is exactly what it is supposed to be - unbelievable cinematic fun, a fully-realized universe unto itself, and the beautiful telling of a story that is at once both complex and quite simple.  It is ancient myth repackaged.And R2-D2 kicks butt."	5.0	okay, so it turned into an essay	2005-05-24	5	4	1

Pouliot	"Following 5 previous efforts, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is everything you'd expect of a George Lucas space epic. While stellar on special effects and battle scenes, it's horribly weak on storytelling, spotty on casting and cringe-inducing in the script department. But, truth be told, it could have been far, far worse.The film's battle scenes were gorgeously shot--though I had no idea who was who--so it was hard to know which laser blast to cheer for. The panoramas (against which lame actors delivered vapid dialog) were absolutely breathtaking. And George did a nice job of bringing us back to where the series began -- an isolated moisture farm on Tatooine, where an infant is delivered for safekeeping under the maternal gaze of twin suns.In spite of some truly silly moments - Yoda hopping like a rabid hamster during a light-saber battle; Hayden Christiansen's 2-mode Anakin Skywalker (mad or madder) - the film is engaging and impressive in its own way. Though it has no serious take-away value (things that stay with you on the drive home) ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a fitting end to a series that captivated several generations of moviegoers, injecting its mitichlorions into the American cultural bloodstream. Love it, hate it, or wish it was better, the ""Star Wars"" cycle has become an ineradicable part of who we are.3 stars for the movie, plus 1 for nostaliga's sake."	4.0	The Star Wars cycle - it's history!	2005-06-18	6	3	3

Obi Wan and Qui Gon is simply the best fight scene ever, at least for now) and I really hope we get a lot of close up shots of Anikin's face in this final battle with Obi Wan. I hope we see the anguish he feels when fighting his master (""You have been like a father to me""). But that scene where the emperor tells Vader to ""RISE"" and we see him for the first time.....the chills were incredible. I know he is evil but he is so darn cool.Hats off to George for creating the best series of films ever. Sorry Jackson fans but while LOTR is an awesome set of movies(my personal number 2), they were done with today's technology. That alone makes Star Wars the better because back when it was originally released the technology was non-existent and the movies still rocked."	5.0	Star Wars Episod III is coming.......Finally	2004-11-17	28	10	18
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1IAOUVMLOSTJU	"Jedi Joel ""Force Extraordinaire"""	"(Warning: Spoilers ahead)Rating: 3.5 out of 5 starsEpisode III, Revenge of the Sith, is the best film of the prequel trilogy. Considering the caliber of these three films, however, this doesn't say very much.Being a former die-hard fan of the saga, my feelings leading up to the release were mixed. I was certainly looking forward to seeing the film as soon as I could (I booked a midnight premiere ticket weeks in advance), but after seeing how badly Lucas had blundered with the previous two installments, I was afraid that I would leave the theatre ashamed to call the film a part of the once-legendary Star Wars epic. Fortunately, I did not feel this way at the end of the film.Unfortunately, my feelings were not that much better either.The opening text crawl of the film presented an ominous indication of what the film would potentially be like. ""War!"" and clich&eacute;s such as ""There are heroes on both sides"" and ""Evil is everywhere!"" were corny, even for the typical standard used in the introductions. Couple that with what appeared to be overly-forced dialogue acting by Ewan McGregor in the initial scene, and I was beginning to wonder whether my prophecy about the film would come true. I certainly had a bad feeling about this!Sadly, it did not get much better as the film progressed. Count Dooku was ""eliminated"" from the film way too quickly and unconvincingly (Christopher Lee seems to have a knack for landing that kind of role lately, no?) after a short fight scene which lacked the excitement and intensity found in the previous two films, and the poor dialogue made me cringe as much as I had done watching the two other prequels (""I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way"", etc). This pattern of poor acting, poor dialogue, and weak action scenes was to continue throughout the film.The main things that negatively impacted the film were:1. Horrible, horrible dialogueI think it has become apparent to everyone by now that whilst Mr Lucas may be a superb visionary, he certainly needs help in the field of scriptwriting. ALOT of help.  The kind of tacky dialogue most people have come to expect has continued. Such horrible lines as ""Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I can't follow"", and ""Something's happening... I'm not the Jedi I should be"" really take away the seriousness of what was meant to be the darkest of the six films.Suprisingly, the acting wasn't as bad in this film as has been in the past. Ian McDiarmid gave a very convincing performance as Sidious/Palpatine and sent chills down my spine with some of his more darker scenes. Ewan McGregor, Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman and Samuel L Jackson all gave reasonable performance in their respective roles (as did other actors such as Jimmy Smits and the voice of Frank Oz) but the poor dialogue really gave them little to work with and greatly affected their performances.2. Lackluster action scenesThe action scenes were rather weak, particularly in comparison to the past films. Dooku's untimely death and the final duel between Obi-Wan and Anakin were too abruptly resolved, and lacked the passion and excitement of the last two films (in particular Darth Maul VS Obi-Wan in Phantom Menace). Worse was the scene where Mace Windu and his Jedi counterparts confronted Sidious - I thought that Jedis were meant to be a tough and skilful bunch, but after seeing two Jedi defeated within about 5 seconds worth of combat (and the third soon after), my trust in the Light side of the Force was seriously questioned!!The large-scale battles also were rather unexciting and mundane in comparison to what we had seen in Attack of the Clones.3. The MusicIn the past, Star Wars has become universally recognisable by its music alone, and this was due to the fabulously moving scores composed by John Williams. After paying keen attention to the score and hoping for more greatness, I have to ask: What happened, Mr Williams?! Every Star Wars film up to date has had superb signature themes; even the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones had ""Duel of the Fates"" and ""Across the Stars"" respectively to redeem their otherwise weak features. However, I failed to hear any real innovation this time and the far majority of the music was basically rehashes of past themes in an ultimately less-than-satisfying manner. This was even more disappointing than the bad dialogue in my opinion, considering the superior past quality of work produced by Mr Williams. The Force was definitely NOT strong with this one.4. Depth of Story (or lack thereof!)What had the worst impact on the film in my opinion was the way in which Lucas handled (or didn't handle) the most crucial scenes of the film. The discovery by Anakin that Palpatine was indeed the Sith Lord, which had the potential to be gripping and pivotal to the film, was instead extremely anti-climatic and disappointing- Palpatine practically just told Anakin he was the Sith Lord! Years of craftilly maneuvering the Senate, the Jedi Council, and the Separatists to fulfill his own ends whilst hiding his own true identity, and he basically tells Anakin he's a Sith. What gives?!Furthermore, Anakin's descent to the Dark Side was perhaps the MOST disappointing aspect of the film in spite of the fact that it was meant to be the most important part. Lucas had enough insight to make the angle an intriuging one - Anakin was conflicted by his love for Padme and the premonitions of her death and was manipulated into believing that the Dark Side was the only way to save her. In spite of this, the inner conflict he experienced was explored for about 2 minutes altogether. The viewer did NOT get any real insight or depth into Anakin's overriding dilemma and when he meekly pledged his allegiance to the Dark Side of the Force after practically no deliberation on his part or dramatic buildup through the storyline, I knew that the film would ultimately be a disappointment. The most crucial part of the film - the ultimate tragedy of the saga - and the part which needed the most attention by far had been overlooked, and I assume that priority was instead given to the creation of spectacular visual feats (which weren't THAT spectacular, mind you).Oh, and I'm not even going to get started on the horribly weak acceptance by Vader that he had killed Padme and that all was lost. All I can say to that scene is ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" *shakes fists in air*5. Loose EndsYes, Lucas did leave a few loose ends in my opinion.""Do you remember your mother, your REAL mother?"", Luke asks Leia in Return of the Jedi. Whilst one can argue that Leia could have had intuitive recollections of Padme's kindess, beauty and sadness which explains her answer to Luke in the film, it is shown unconvincingly in the film. I guess their mother really did die when they were very young, as Leia suggested. Her answer, however, implies that Padme spent more than a few fleeting seconds with Leia before her demise. Guess not.Why didn't Obi-wan seem to recognise R2D2 in ""A New Hope""? When did Anakin say that he wanted his son to have his lightsaber? There are probably more minor ones like these, and their lack of resolution is a little frustrating.Oh, and why didn't Qui-gon Jinn disappear in Episode 1? I thought we were meant to find this out. I'm still waiting to find out.In spite of all this, ""Revenge"" did have some redeeming factors:1. Visual and Sound EffectsThe visuals and sound effects were practically as flawless as ever. At least Lucas fulfilled what we had all come to expect of him in this department.2. Flow of the filmThe film flowed reasonably well. In spite of their lack of depth, the abundance of short scenes allowed the film to continue at its breakneak pace throughout the entire 2+ hours as Lucas no doubt set out to do. Both a blessing a curse, in my opinion.3. The endingThe juxtaposition of the birth of Darth Vader and the death of Padme Amidala (or rather, the metaphorical death of Anakin Skywalker and the birth of Padme Amidala through her children, Luke and Leia) was beautifully done and temporarily made me forget about much of the dismal mess Lucas had created since first embarking upon the prequel trilogy. In spite of the unbelievability and rushed nature of the circumstances of Padme's death (""She has lost the will to live""??), and Vader's rather lame and abrupt acceptance of his loss of Padme (see above!!), the end of the film was still quite moving. Combine this with the sublimely fitting final shot of the binary sunset of Tatooine to link the film to its successor, A New Hope, and at least the ending sweetened the sour taste in my mouth that had formed throughout the rest of movie.George Lucas had previously said that he considered extending the length of the film upwards of an additional 30 minutes but decided against it. I believe that this was probably the worst mistake he could have made. If the additional time had been dedicated to deepening the most crucial parts of the plot - Anakin's inner turmoil and his succumbing to the Dark Side, Palpatine's revelation of his true identity, the crumbling of the Republic, etc - then this film may very well have been given a 5 star rating and be considered as one of the best, if not THE best, of the Star Wars films. Instead, whilst relieved that ""Sith"" was a step up from the shambles of ""Menace"" and ""Clones"", I still left the theatre wondering when the magical feeling I got from watching Star Wars disappeared.Sith happens."	4.0	"To quote Darth Vader in the film,  ""NOOOOOOOOO!!!"""	2005-05-19	10	6	4

With the Council pulling him one way and Chancellor Palpatine pulling him another, it is no wonder that Anakin finally broke. With Palpatine telling him that he is better than the other Jedi and the Anakin being allowed to join the Council but not make the rank of Master, it just fueled Palpatine's plan to pull Anakin over to the Dark Side. Once on the Dark Side of the Force Anakin couldn't return with all of his emotion out and his anger finally being able to be free, he was trapped. This is exactly what Palpatine wanted. The Saber fight and the incredibly mind-boggling graphics it is no wonder that this was the best Star Wars movie ever.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ	"Jeff Edwards ""RadioJeff"""	I disagree with the many who have come to this forum for no other reason than to literally dissect virtually scene by scene this entire film and (attempt) to discuss the failings of George Lucas and his lame grab at the former glory that was the original three films.  I have seen less details in College Final Exams than I have here.  These films are NOT supposed to move the world and increase our intellect and help us through the tough times of our lives -- they are simply movies designed for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY.  Let's not begin to sound like the hopeless geek who is 37 years old and still lives in Mommy's basement and has never been on a date.Was the dialogue something to be proud of?  Gee, I certainly HOPE not, but what the movie lacked in sophisticated conversation between characters, it more than made up in sheer energy.  As I originally read the novel several weeks before the release of the film I understood that visually, this was going to be one of the biggest treats in all of cinema history.  In this respect, Lucas did NOT disappoint.  I have read a few reviews which derides Lucas for giving us fantastic effects in some shots and shoddy visuals in others.  I am frantically searching my memory of the midnight showing I attended early this morning and I cannot think of a single shot in the movie which did not look stunning and visually impressive.  Maybe some of the geekier fans can *see* better than I can.  I found myself eagerly awaiting this movie more so than Attack of the Clones, and almost as much as Phantom Menace.  Sure, like many others, I was a bit upset with the direction of the prequel movies, but I am also a BIG believer in that this is George Lucas' vision, and HIS story, and whether we like it or not, we should allow him to make the films the way HE wants.  If somebody really believes they can write a better script, by all means do something about it and convince Lucas to allow you the chance to either pen it into a novel, or have him recant the film and make a new and better version based on YOUR vision instead.  Oh, what's that you say?  You can't do that?  Then sit down and stop whining.  The movie, despite the many flaws which at some times could distract from the flow of the movie, still managed to entertain me, which it was INTENDED to do from the outset.  Were there continuity errors when compared with the original trilogy?  Absolutely.  Obi Wan instructing Luke to learn to become a Jedi from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed him, from Empire is just one of the many that have occurred over the films.  The main one from Episode III has to be Amidala dying during childbirth, which doesn't add up to the conversation with Luke & Leia from Return of the Jedi.  We can go over the movies day after day and take it apart frame by frame and it won't get anybody anywhere, so why do it?  Unfortunately, you can bet that the day after the films release, there will be thousands of middle-aged men and young boys who will be neglecting a good many really important things just so they can do exactly that.  Sad.In short, I found that I came away from the film feeling satisfied and thrilled that George saw fit to give us the entire saga from beginning to end.  The rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker, and his eventual redemption in the end.  Unfortunately there will be many who will desperately seek to find hidden meanings to all of these films for the rest of time and lose out on life in the process.  Me?  I'll probably buy it on DVD and fervently hope that Lucas takes a page from the incredible success of the Lord of the Rings DVD's and give us exta footage deleted from the film.  Either way, I'll be just fine and continue to consider myself a closet Star Wars fan for the rest of my life.	4.0	Despite HORRIBLE dialogue, the movie IS FUN...	2005-05-19	5	4	1

This film is so dark it makes Episode V look like Sesame Street and now we'll look at Vader a little differently. After seeing this movie, you'd wish that Episodes IV-VI don't already exist.

Yes, the effects are great and there is a lot of action. It's just that the characters are weak, the acting is poor and the script - let's just say that George had too many ""yes"" men working for him.His last three movies have all had terrible scripts that not even good actors could make interesting.

Obi Wan responds, ""...ONLY the Sith deal in absolutes."" Oh really? Then why  is Obi Wan so ABSOLUTE that the ""dark side"" is ""evil,"" and that Anakin is ""lost?"" Good and bad have clear divisions in Star Wars, it's not a realm that deals with ""greys.""This Obi Wan observation is a transparent shot at George W. Bush (""either you're with us, or you're with the terrorists""), and it really doesn't fit in the Star Wars universe. I can't help but think that Lucas thought this Bush bashing would give him an ""in"" at Sundance, Cannes, etc.Another huge plot hole is the fact that Yoda fought Palpitine ONCE... it ends in a stalemate, then Yoda declares ""I must go into hiding.""WHY? Yoda nearly defeated the villian! I would had bought into this ""wimping out"" by Yoda if he hypothetically said ""I've had a vision... one is to come that WILL defeat the Emperor.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3KY68OTSNHM3G	Jeffrey T. Munson	"In this stunning and excellent finale to the ""Star Wars"" saga, we finally see Anakin's final, pitiful fall from heroic Jedi Knight to evil Sith Lord.  In the beginning, Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) are flying their starfighters in an attempt to rescue Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from the clutches of the evil cyborg General Grievous.  Upon reaching the Chancellor, the two Jedi are set upon by Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), who cut Anakin's hand off in Episode II.  The result is different this time.Once safely back, Palpatine begins his subtle proddings of Anakin, explaining to him that the Jedi council doesn't really have his best interests in mind, and Anakin would be better off if he followed Palpatine's advice.  Meanwhile, Padme (Natalie Portman) informs Anakin that she is pregnant.  Palpatine appoints Anakin to be his personal representative on the Jedi council, but the Jedi do not give him the rank of Master.  The Jedi also have a request of Anakin; to spy on Palpatine's doings and report back to them.  Anakin, although angry at not being made a Master, agrees to the Jedi's request.Soon, Anakin is being pulled in two directions; the Jedi council, who want to know what the Chancellor is up to, and the Chancellor, who is filling Anakin's head with mistruths about the Jedi.  Its as though Anakin will explode at any minute.  During a visit with Palpatine, Anakin learns that there is a way to prevent harm from coming to a loved one.  Anakin, troubled by dreams of Padme dying in childbirth, eagerly listens, but finds out that this cannot be learned from a Jedi.  Anakin is slowly falling farther from the Jedi and closer to Palpatine.  Upon discussing the dark side with Anakin, Anakin finally realizes that Palpatine is indeed a Sith Lord.  He leaves to tell the Jedi council of his findings.  Soon, Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) arrives to arrest the Chancellor.  Anakin, however, also returns as well.  After a furious light saber battle, Mace has the Chancellor at his mercy, but Anakin does not allow Mace to finish the job, saying that the Chancellor should be tried.  Undeterred, Mace tries to finish off Palpatine, but Anakin steps in.  His downfall to the dark side is now complete, as Anakin swears allegiance to Palpatine.During all of this action, Obi-Wan has successfully located and destroyed General Grievous.  Anakin's first mission as Darth Vader, his new name given to him by Palpatine, is to destroy the remaining Jedi.  Palpatine poisoned Anakin's mind by telling him that the Jedi were trying to take control of the Senate, and that they didn't really care about him.  Soon, the Jedi Temple is awash with dead Jedi, except for Obi-Wan and Yoda.  Upon returning to the temple, they learn the awful truth about Anakin, and Obi-Wan knows he must face is old friend, this time as his enemy.This movie is spectacular.  The acting is magnificent, especially by Hayden Christensen.  He has really matured since Episode II, and his portrayal of the troubled and disturbed Anakin is the highlight of the film.  Ewan McGregor is equally good as Obi-Wan.  You can almost feel his pain and heartbreak as he is forced to fight his life long friend, and his cry of ""you were the chosen one"" and how he loved and cared for Anakin is truly moving.  Even after becoming Darth Vader and nearly being killed by Obi-Wan, you cannot help but feel sorry for Anakin.  Palpatine tricks him into believing that he killed Padme, and his anguished cry is all that he can do.I give this movie my very highest recommendation.  It is by far the best of the Star Wars films.  Watch this exciting and poignant final installment and see a troubled soul make his ultimate fall to the dark side."	5.0	"""You Were the Chosen One!!"""	2005-11-01	7	5	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1KVJQ6PFL3I6T	"Jeff Rockwell ""Thinker, Dancer and Lover of Life"""	"This review applies to the whole second trilogy.  If it makes me a geek who should have many better things to do, then so be it.I was a huge fan of the original movies (EPs IV-VI, with Empire being my favorite) as a kid and have been considerably let down by the newer ones.  Many say that's simply because I am no longer a child and am not as receptive to that sort of thing.  This isn't true however, as I have often had ""that feeling"" during other movies and books in my adult life (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and The Ramayana, to give an example of each).Anyway, for those of you who think you can, without getting nauseous, read the rantings of a let down Star Wars fan, here some of the main things I didn't like about the new trilogy...1) MedichloriansGet this nonsense out of here. The force is supposed to be a mystical life energy that ultimately transcends space and time (Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back: ""Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter""); it is not something that can be isolated, quantified and analyzed in a test tube. In my mind George seriously stumbled when he felt he had to sacrifice the heart of his vision on the altar of modern science, materialism and StarTrek.Another example of George smiting ""the force"" comes in Episode II when Obi Wan says to Anakin (of his lightsabre, after he absentmindedly misplaces it): ""Without it you are powerless"". Since when is a Jedi's /lightsabre/ the source of his power?For those of you who were ""at that age"" when the original trilogy came out, think about what it was about those movies that made them so enchanting and unforgettable. Some will cite the particular characters, others love the story and the music, and there are always the special effects. The defining feature of the original three, I think,  was how well put together and ""whole"" the movies seemed. You had all these different elements-- each of them amazing and inspired on their own-- functioning in a profound harmony together (which is what gave the films such a powerful resonance within so many young hearts, my own included). The original movies were inspired-- George Lucas and his team had a story to tell that came from their hearts and fertile imaginations and at centre of it all was this idea of ""the force""-- this mystical and mysterious all pervading life energy that ""binds the galaxy together"". It was this spiritual undercurrent that separated Lucas' universe from all similar ones-- and it is here we find the true heart of the story. Remember the first time Obi-Wan mentioned the force to Luke in A New Hope and this mysterious and haunting melody kicked in that drew you full boar into this world and its tale? It is this ""grab"" that I find lacking in the new movies-- they have lost their heart, their inspiration, and a testimony to this fact is the way Lucas has abused and forgotten the force in his newer movies.2) Yoda and Palapatine fighting with light sabres.I didn't like this at all. Both of those characters would be much more dignified in real life, I think. Yoda should have been a recluse the whole time-- with Jedi making the ritual journey to him to receive training. (Remember in Return of the Jedi when Obi Wan states that he took Anakin on as his own pupil instead of going to see Yoda? This isn't consistent with how things were presented in the new trilogy and I think the other way would have allowed Yoda to hold on to more of his dignity.)3) The over-reliance on digital special effectsIt is a curious fact that if you play an analogue recording of birds singing, other birds will sing along, but they will not do this to a digital recording. Why is this? Digital media currently lacks both a presence and depth in its compositions-- to the point that if you watch a movie-- like the new Star Wars movies-- that are done almost entirely on a computer, the environment lacks a certain warmth that makes what you are seeing harder to embrace. That and there was just way too much crap on the screen a lot of the time. I found the old stop-motion work with the costumes, props and muppets much more satisfying.4) Bad choice of actor for AnakinThis character, in Lucas' own words, is the main focus of the entire trilogy. The fellow who played Anakin was a bit too much of a whiny prettyboy-- he lacked the presence, magnetism and stoic gravity necessary for Vader."	1.0	Disappointed.	2006-01-15	67	48	19

As a fan, I've been asked, as you have, or will, ""Now that you have seen all six star wars, what is your favorite, and rate them from best to least."" Here I go, for you all to read, Because I hope to get to the bottom of this, and perhaps put it in perspective for you all, just in case you haven't thought of it.1.ep. IV. You just can't beat the first. ""great shot kid, that was one in a million."" Harrison Ford made the Original trilogy fun. Something missing from the prequels, until episode 3.2.ep. V. The chase scenes through the asteroids are enough to satisfy the general population. The duel between Darth vader and his soon to be revealed son, makes this film one of the best sequels ever. But a sequel is a sequel, giving the advantage to the timeless episode 4 for it's perfect flow from one scene to another.3.Ep. III. Here's the big one. I'll stand by this vehemently. It beats out the overly silly Ewok ridden Return of the Jedi, with powerhitting action that defeats the epic space battle at the end of 'return of the jedi.' Episode three is dark, the darkest of any. And extremely emotion driven. The Godfather like assasination of the Jedi order, nearly brought tears to my eyes. Long time fans, like me, are complete with this film. This film will live long, getting better with every watching. But it lacks the fresh feel of the first two. The writing wasn't as beautiful as the original two nor is the acting (any actor would have a tough job working with this dialogue.) But far be it from ruining the fun of this awe inspiring movie. The special effects team pulled off every trick in its book, leaving nothing to be saved. ""you were the chosen one!"", spoken by Ewan Mcgregor, who is the perfect Obi wan, Such a wonderful contrast to the nervous acting of the young crew around him. They really pushed that rating system also, the PG-13 doesn't go to waste. Some of Sci-fi's most awesome disfiguring scenes!4.Ep. VI. Return of the jedi. This movie took on a much to light tone(Ewoks defeating the emperors troups> ""A legion of my finest troops await!"". Although excedingly fun watching the glorious triumph of good over evil, and boy has it been a long time comming! I threw up my arms and bellowed, along with the audience! Bikini's, giant worms getting choked, ANOTHER death Star, The Symoblic, and beautifully choreographed light saber fight between Luke and Darth. It is the closing of the greatest trilogy ever, so you had to cry at the end, watching those who survived the SPACE war, then the misery of Luke, burning the corpse of his estranged father.5.Ep II. I was hoping this movie would get better with time, but the movie is just not my cup of tea. It is lackluster; beating out the first with a gladiator like battle royal of jedi vs robots. Am i the only one who hates the title of this thing?6.Ep I. This is a real horror show. Super Fans have a hard time mentioning this one. I waited in line for six hours, and left crying like Anakin after getting second at a science festival. Jar Jar binks will go down in history as the worst major character ever.So there they are, the life's work of one man with a great dream. Nothing can take away the importance this man has on this industry then and now, and in the end, i believe he is one of the most important figures in cinema ever who stuck to a dream and never changed it for anyone but yet listened to his fans. Thanks George for all the fun. Enjoy the retirement."	4.0	The best of the prequels. The story is completed.	2005-05-19	5	4	1

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A259W5KIP41XFL	Jennifer A. Everhart	I am a huge Star Wars fan. The original trilogy films were great, and the first two prequels were decent, but not the same hype as the others. I saw Attack of the Clones in theaters with my aunt when I was ten. And now, the saga is complete. Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) has grown into an accomplished Jedi Knight. When he and his former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) rescue Chancelor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from General Grevious (voice of Matthew Wood), Palpatine pressured Anakin into killing Count Dooku (a.k.a. Darth Tyrranus, played by Christopher Lee) in cold blood, assuring he was to dangerous to be kept alive. After the rescue, Anakin was facing the prospect of breaking the news to everyone else of his secret marriage to Padm&egrave; (Natalie Portman) now that she became pregnant, and with the vision of her dying in childbirth weigh heavy in his mind. He tries to prevent this from happening, but turns to the Dark Side of the Force and completes his transformation into Darth Vader (body by Hayden Christensen, voice by James Earl Jones). This entry was awesome, but nothing compaired to A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. There were a few oddities, though. For example, Christopher Lee was given supporting billing, but Count Dooku only made a cameo in the beginning. It once again used CGI, but not as much, which would explain a lower budget than its predecesors. It had a darker and grittier storyline than the rest, and even beat The Empire Strikes Back for the darkest and most emotional in the series. This is also the only one to be rated PG-13. All the others were rated PG. This also ended the prequel trilogy on a high emotional note. The acting and dialogue improved, and John Williams returned to compose a more tense score for this one. It had the best lightsaber battles in the series, as well. If you are a fan, like me, then please see this tragic conclusion to the Star Wars prequels. You will not be dissapointed!	4.0	The darkhorse of the Star Wars series and definitely the best of the prequel trilogy	2009-04-21	4	3	1

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1O26YWZJ82P68	"J. Enzinna ""JonnyFunFun"""	"As an avid Star Wars junkie I was one of the many people to go and see this movie more than totally necessary while it was in theatres.  I must be honest in saying that I was not completely impressed with episodes one and two - they were just too ""cheap looking"" to be considered Star Wars, let alone the fact that their storylines seemed to be striving to move the Star Wars appeal to the yonger generation.Episode III, however, is nothing like the first two of the new trilogy.  The story is clear, cut, and precise while still upholding the legendary tradition started in '77.  And just like the originals, the storyline behind Episode III is filled with riveting action and cinematics that will leave you stunned.  One excellent example - the fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan, followed by the most captivating scene in the entire movie - first appearance of Darth Vader on the screen.Although this movie, like most others of this generation, have computer-generated effects, they are not as cartoonish as they were in Episode I, making the movie look a little more real and clean - just like the original trilogy.Set aside the powerful story, great looking special effects, and top-notch cinematics, Episode III also carries with it an untold special aspect - the almost certainty that this will be the last official Star Wars film to hit the silver screen (short of the inevitable re-releases, possible re-makes, and the slim chance that George will continue off the story with Episode VII (hey, it could happen)).Combining all of the above, I must honestly say that after I saw Episode III for the first time in the theatres, I left the theatre speechless.  I can not, however, give this movie the full 5 Stars, as the 5 Star rating is reserved for the original trilogy, which are still the best of them all.All in all - this movie is definately a must-have to add to your existing Star Wars collection.  Or if you're new to Star Wars, this is definately a must-see.  Granted you should watch them all in order, do not be turned off by the horrid screenplay and effects present in Episodes I and II.  Episode III is loads better."	4.0	Best of the new trilogy, but still cannot beat the originals	2005-11-01	2	2	0
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2R8F23VCZHB7M	Jeremy Bailey	"In 1977, a film called ""Star Wars - A New Hope"" was introduced to the world. Several people loved the film and was very eager to see the next one when they heard about it.Even the sixth was a great Star Wars episode. They had interesting characters, character development, a story, plots, action which includes light saber fights, and also a story that kept pretty well decent and clean.What else was nice about the films was how it flowed nicely from one to another, and how gracefully some characters were in handling situations.The classic Star Wars was filmed for the young generation, of that time.That's the truth, weather you like what I am about to say next or not.We now have a new set of Star Wars films. This again, is for the young generation. But we must remember, things have changed. Not all, but alot of young people are more into action films with or without CGI, films about such (weak) romance, and ""as long as there's action, who cares about story development"".That's where we have Star Wars I-III.As for Star Wars III, I couldn't love it like I did the others. Honestly, I care less for I & II than I do III.The beginning is allright, having Obi-Wan and Anakin fight in the war on a rescue mission. During their rescue, it drops. The music isn't there. Some of the action is pointless. That particular scene, they really looked bored, which made me bored.Even though the classic Star Wars films never had any lady ""pregnant"", I can understand in this one, to a certain degree. It was just what was going to happen. But I do not like this ""in bed together"" and ""shirt off"". This was not in the classic Star Wars. Luke nor any other guy was seen without a shirt on, and no guy or girl was found sleeping in bed, alone or with someone.The other part that bothered me, like in Episode II, was the love scenes. Yes, I'm a guy, no girl, and most guys aren't crazy about it. However, put that aside for a moment. This is Star Wars. Han and Leia had some love scenes.Although those were slim and far apart, we knew Han and Leia loved each other. In my mind, they were together, ideal for marrying each other.Why so much with Anakin and Padme? For the younger generation of course. Now it's all drama and romance, soap operas and a gazillion talk shows that are the same format. So what do we get in Star Wars? The same formula. Natually.We rarely see those intellectual films that take more time in writing a story and getting to know the people, and the plots.Just look at Episode III. Guy without a shirt, in bed with girlfriend/fiancee/wife, something NOT in the classics, but this had to be kept ""up to date"", not the way it should have been, ""kept like the classics"".We have characters like Leia with MEANING. A natual born leader type. Padme, in the worst of times, combing her hair and crying.Han freezes in carbonite, while Leia hopelessly watches. What happens? She goes in Jabba's Palace and rescues him.Padme gives birth to twins, and dies because why, no reason to live.Sorry for any sort of insults, but this was made for a less intelligent generation. This was done sloppy. I don't really care if you think I am being all wrong in things. Just look at the classics. See how they're done, how graceful, and how well the characters are known, how likable they are.Look how well you just knew Han and Leia loved each other.Episode III failed. This was suppose to be THE BIG ONE! The final episode to connect them, and the only thing that truely connects the films im my opinion was where the characters are suppose to be. Some may say ""Well, of course!""Well, that was really all that was there about this Star Wars that made the connection. The actual story plots, character/story development, who they are, how they should be, what is in Star Wars and what isn't, didn't really make that connection.Sorry this was long. Hope it was of some help."	2.0	From Classic to Average	2003-12-06	1	0	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2Z24Y1K58ULSE	Jeremy	This was a very good film, with mind-blowing special effects and good fight scenes (more lightsaber fights) with beautiful land and starscapes. However, the acting in this movie was a pile of Sith.Hayden Christiansen, as Anakin, did a reasonable job, given his confused lines, but at times his emotion was completely off-key. He  did, however play a convincing part as a vengeful villian.Ewen McGregor, as Obi-Won, also did a reasonable job, slightly better than his role in Episode II.Ian McDiarmid, as Chancellor Palpatine, stole the show with his very dark and convincing acting as the evil and sinister Chancellor. He really played the part, and had the perfect disposure.Natalie Portman, as Padme, quite simply did a sucky job. Her lines were not only mediocre but it was as though she was asleep the whole time.Between her and Anakin, the dialogue was ruined. Here is a typical exchange between them (this is an ACTUAL EXERPT from the movie):Anakin Skywalker: You are so... beautiful.Senator Amidala: It's only because I'm so in love.Anakin Skywalker: No, it's because I'm so in love with you.Senator Amidala: Are you saying love has blinded you?Anakin Skywalker: [laughs] No, that's not what I meant.While this film's acting was awful, the movie's plot, scenery, and special effects made up for it.	4.0	A Good Movie, But Bad Acting	2005-07-19	8	3	5
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AKIW69HADTANZ	"Jeremy ""JerFloyd"""	"Alright, it is safe to assume that its general knowledge that the first two SW prequels (Phantom and Clones) were mediocre at best and did not capture and enthrall us as did the original trilogy. Yes they shared their moments but lacked the shocking, emotional plot elements of the originals had, especially Empire. Then, something happened, the teaser for Episode III came out and for the first moment of watching it, I could realize already this was something different... This was going to contain the elemetns the fans have really been waiting for. the tradedy of Anakin's fall to evil is perhaps one of the best character archs in years!After seeing it for the first time I literally was shaking inside. My mind couldnt compress the data it just recieved. I was having so much trouble believing the fact that I just left a Star Wars movie that actually, ACTUALLY supassed all expectations. This hasnt happened for me in maybe a decade! There was not a moment on the screen that I was not DEAD SET on watching and could have probably been punched in the chest and not realized it. Its as if Lucas realized that he messed up his LIFE DREAM on the fitst two prequels and decided to actually PUT EFFORT into the work and came out with something we didnt realize he was capable of. It almost makes me mad because he OBVIOUSLY didnt put this kind of effort into the first two films, by far!Now that ive ranted about how friggen wonderous this movie is, I have one small thing about it. Its strange because it in no way hurts THIS FILM, it hurts the original trilogy... The thing is, when Anakin turns to the dark side in this film, he TURNS TO THE DARK SIDE. He is so friggen evil he almost makes Hannibal seem friendly. (Warning spoilers here) Somewhere between cutting off an enemy's head, to cutting off a Jedi master's arm, to KILLING UNARMED CHILDREN, and my favorite, CHOKING YOUR PREGNANT WIFE, he is the most dark twisted vile and terrifying person ever to grace the star wars universe! Why is this possibly a bad thing? Heres why, because if he became that evil, and that dark, where did it all translate to once we catch up to the original trilogy? It doesnt sadly. Obviously A New Hope came first, but III into IV dont flow because the original Vader IS NOT AS EVIL as we want him to be now. It seems lacking now to watch the originals because all i say now when I see Darth is YOUR NOT EVIL ENOUGH! When Vader sees Obi Wan again after 22 years, he simply says Ive bee waiting for you obi wan, we meet again at last... Maybe it would be more like YOU CUT OFF MY ARM AND BOTH LEGS AND LEFT ME TO BURN ALIVE! I AM GOING TO KILL YOU! At least thats how i would feel.Well once again, there is nothing wrong with III, its just how it now compares to the originals that seems to be lacking.""you brought him here to kill me!"""	5.0	Without Doubt the Star Wars We've been Wanting, but...	2005-10-01	10	8	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AK6KLV8GYXT8Q	"Jerry L. Kouzes ""Real World"""	"After seeing this movie, I still asked myself... Why did the Sith want Revenge?  This was never address thoughout the movie. At least not that I saw. Besides, bring up more questions, then answered, for example, how was the Chancellor kidnapped?  Funny, that in order to answer a few questions, you had to watch the Clone Wars cartoon to see the answers to some of the questions. WHY?? These movies should have been one continous story, which they weren't.For example, between Esp 1 & 2, How come Yoda and the Jedi Council, knowing the ""possible"" destiny of Anakin to be their version of the messiah, didn't go back to where Obi Wan found Anakin, and free his mother, since she would be the turning point and reason partly for his start down the path to the ""Dark Side"". Seems like the Jedi are worthless in making sure the chosen one could indeed mend the Dark and Light Sides.Next the time span.. In Star Wars: A New Hope, it gives the impression that the Empire has been around for at least a hundred years. Also it gave the impression that Darth Vader was the one who hunted down the Jedi Knights, funny he didn't do a very good job.  Also, o' Darth Vader seems to be really stupid, in not knowing that his wife was going to give birth to twins.  Of course he had visions of her dieing at child birth, but not rather the childern would live. And He didn't try to find them!!From watching this film, I got the impression that the Jedi were really a pain in the tushcas, and very stupid.One thing that has always brothered me, was the part of the first film when Obi's master brought young Anakin to the Jedi Council, and Yoda says ""To old, is he""... How old was this kid supposed to be? 10 something and he was in love with a 16 yr old girl.  Seems that Lucas should have answered where do little Jedi's  come from?  If you can't be in love, as a Jedi, since this is an emotion, no wonder Anakin rebelled again the Jedi order. Dark Side looked more interesting to me."	3.0	Why did the Sith want Revenge?	2005-08-23	18	3	15

This movie blows the pants off the other two prequels (I'm desperately trying to be loyal to the original trilogy, but this movie is making it hard.)  The action is non-stop and the special effects are totally off the charts. George Lucas did an absolutely amazing job of tying up all the loose ends, and I do mean ALL the loose ends!  It flows perfectly into Episode IV! The actors were all well-cast, especially Ian McDiarmid who turned in a fine performance as  Palpatine.  It definitely deserves its PG-13 rating (for it's  fighting sequences and dark nature) which I think enhances its appeal and makes for a more interesting storyline.The bad news...it's not perfect. In my opinion, it has flaws (egads!), mostly in its logic.  1)  I find it hard to believe that no one on the Jedi council figured out Anakin and Padme were married.  I mean, where did they think Anakin slept at night?  2)  Mace Windu tells Anakin to ""wait in the council room"" after hearing from him about Palpatine.  You don't tell an impatient young up-start to WAIT somewhere by himself!  I don't think a Jedi of Mace Windu's calibur would have made such a mistake.  3)  Anakin's got some major childhood issues going on.  Surely he would have talked to Obi-wan about them by now, and given up his ideas about changing another person's destiny.  4) Some of the acting was rather deadpan.  I think the fault lies with George Lucas, as the director, more than with the actors.  I realize the Jedi are not prone to emotional outbursts, but Lucas could have done so much more through FACIAL expressions like he did with Yoda.Flaws aside, George Lucas has accomplished his mission.  I look at Episodes IV, V, and VI differently now that I know the who, what, where, when, and why.  I now actually feel sorry for Anakin/Darth Vader, rather than hating him, because his story is so tragic.  Good-looking guy with so much going for him suddenly loses everything and is reduced to half his body mass.  MAJOR BUMMER!  (I think it was a good idea to put Hayden Christensen in the final scenes of the ""ROTJ"" DVD.  Poor Anakin deserves to get his youth and good-looks back after all he went through!)So, this is the end of an era.  Although I'm saddened to know there won't be another Star Wars movie to look forward to,  I think George Lucas, the brilliant mind that he is, needs to go out on top. Boy... and what a way to go!!  The Star Wars saga is now truly complete!!!"	4.0	WOW!  A spectacular ending to a spectacular saga!!	2005-05-24	1	1	0
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2EBLL2OYEQJN9	Jessica Lux	The is the story that Lucas has wanted to tell for a while, but the techonology wasn't available to create his masterpiece.  In today's technology age, his masterpiece could be realized, and it leaps off the screen at the viewer.While the movie is visually stunning, full of amazing characters, scenes, and battles, what makes it a true masterpiece is the way it fills in the backstory of the world we all know so well from the Star Wars original trilogy.  By the end of this movie, everything has fallen into place perfectly for where the characters and the universe are at the start of Episode IV.  Seeing the transformation of Darth Vader is unbelievably amazing.  Hearing him breathe for the first time will make your heart catch in your chest, because you see the final bridge between the Anakin we watched grow up in the second trilogy and the villian we all know from the original trilogy.Way to end the Star Wars series of movies, Lucas!	5.0	Awe-inspiring and well worth the wait	2005-09-17	21	13	8
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1MMKUAZAKL395	Jevron Mc Crory	After all the hype, the seemingly endless years of waiting and the hopes and fears of moviegoers all over the world regarding the final Star Wars movie, the battle ground was set for the (finally) favourably titled `Revenge of the Sith.'George Lucas had worked under no illusions. If this film failed to deliver, then by many detractors standards it would serve as the final nail in the coffin of the new and 'modern' trilogy. Thankfully then, not only has Lucas succeeded in crafting one of his most accomplished films ever but arguably his most important; `Episode III' is an incredibly self assured triumph. Masterfully bringing the epic saga full circle, completing a story begun in 1977 and thereby seamlessly connecting the original trilogy with the prequels, `Sith' effectively addresses much of what critics found noticeably lacking in the previous two instalments, lending much needed credibility to the 'new' trilogy, displaying a marked improvement in direction and substance, and a commendable maturity in attention to character and story.Kicking off with an opening space battle that utilises a roller coaster ride POV to spectacular effect, the film twists and turns us in it's stylishly comfortable grip, throwing us headlong into the already ensuring action. Meeting up with old friends Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker (the love and respect between accomplished master and seasoned Jedi clearly apparent in these early sequences) as they cut a destructive swathe across the screen, cursing and teasing each other in equal measure as they take apart ships, scenery and even mechanical staff wielding bio-droids (magna guards) is a joy to behold (and it's noteworthy here to mention how utterly at ease both Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen now appear to be in their respective guises)...but the fun ultimately cannot last forever...Controlling the pace like the master story teller and film editor Lucas is, it's a restrained twenty minutes before the Jedi once again encounter Christopher Lee's elegantly vicious Count Dooku, but Anakin is no longer the fool hardy padawan he once was and it's from this point on that the first 'real' inevitable step towards the dark side is taken. Forsaking the cartoon-like cuddly tones of 'Menace' and even the pressure-cooker foreboding of 'Clones', 'Sith' stakes it's claim in this newly explored darker territory with glee; this is not, and was never designed to be, an episode for kids.As the story progresses and tragedy draws ever near, the film bludgeons Christensen's Anakin with heart rending blows at every turn. His learning of his secret wife Padme's pregnancy is cursed with sudden and traumatising visions of her death in childbirth, reawakening his feelings of regret and loss over the death of his mother (whom he is still convinced he could have saved) and in-turn, his feelings of resentment towards his 'family', the Jedi, who continue to praise his abilities yet refuse him the one thing he desires most in the world. With the enduring guidance and influence of the artificially benign Chancellor Palpatine (seemingly able to offer Anakin all the answers at a time when he is most in need), the young Jedi begins to doubt everything, even the fidelity of the very woman he is trying to save till finally, when the pitch of the movie appears to have reached it's dramatic peak, Anakin makes a choice that will ultimately lead him down an irrevocable path that will change the face of the galaxy...and set the stage for cinematic history.`Revenge of the Sith' boasts not only some of the most audacious set pieces yet attempted in a blockbuster (Kenobi and Grievous' wheel bike/dragon mount chase, the continuation of The Clone Wars, Yoda and Sidious' epic senate duel, where politics and morality clash physically for the very first time) but some of the most intense and emotionally affecting. In essence; `Sith' is an action movie with heart. For sentimentality and effective storytelling using the minimum of trickery or techniques, look no further than the wonderfully sombre and underplayed moment of telepathic understanding that Anakin and Padme share across a Coruscant afternoon sun shrouded cityscape, or that Padme's final words are of concern for the man who has, in essence, murdered her emotionally and physically, or the look and tone of sadness Yoda exhibits as he is forced to flee his encounter with Sidious, or more importantly, the haunting shades of music and imagery that follows the execution of Order 66......but for both emotion and hyper charged dramatic electricity, the climatic Mustafar duel between Vader and Kenobi is unsurpassed. This is a duel that people have been waiting to see since 1977 and it does not disappoint. For the battle of heroes where 'brothers' clash with clear intentions that only one will survive, Lucas has married all tools at his disposal (a tragic yet epic sweeping score, a blink-and-you'll-miss-ten-moves lightsaber choreography, acting intensity that never fails to convince, CGI that threatens at every turn; VERY real danger, etc..) to create a sequence that both excites and moves in equal measure and despite the fact that we all know how the battle ends, it makes it no easier to watch the horrific events unfold.In stark contrast to maulings regarding the acting in the other two prequels, the performances in `Sith' are first rate. Ewan McGregor predictably shines in a role it seems he was destined to play (particularly in the final minutes of the Mustafar confrontation) and flickers of Alec Guinness punctuate throughout, never threatening to turn his performance into mere mimicry. Natalie Portman, (however little she was required to do), breaks our hearts as the man she loves literally rots from the inside before her very eyes. Ian McDiarmid turns in an oscar worthy performance, hamming it up where necessary to break stride suddenly with a glare and a disembowelling tone when the mood takes him, but above all (and despite protests to the contrary), it is Hayden Christensen for whom the highest regard must be reserved. His performance permeates one of utter believability, shifting remarkably from eager Jedi knight to chilling Sith apprentice so smoothly that it's startling to witness. The ferocity and utter neutrality that Christensen exhibits as the young Darth Vader is truly impressive if not downright mesmerising, yet the best is saved for last in the final confrontation that husband and wife share prior to the fiery duel into the very bowels of hell. Hayden's demeanour of a man who believes above all else that he has done the right thing yet utterly blind to the fact he has caused more damage than good is staggering, his tone (in a wonderful symmetry with 'Menace`) echoing the youthful idealistic young boy he was once, reminding us yet again how far the soul has fallen. It's a moment (like so many others) that entrenches itself so deeply into the mind that you will be hard pressed to rid yourself of certain emotions long after `Sith's' credits have rolled.Expectedly, `Revenge of the Sith' will delight as many as it will disappoint, but as far as taking us on a new and unexpected journey a long time ago through a galaxy far away in spectacular fashion (never allowing indulgence or flights of mere fancy to intrude upon the story), `Sith' is a worthy contender for the greatest Star Wars film of all time.In closing, I have already watched `Sith' more times than I have seen the original trilogy and the film leaves me with a different impression every time. The birth of Darth Vader is something everyone has been dreaming about since the release of the classic `A New Hope,' thank god George Lucas has managed to create a movie that will live on just as long.	5.0	This IS The Chosen One!	2006-03-21	52	41	11

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A19L4J82QJPY7B	J. Gordon	"[NOTE: THERE ARE SPOILERS IN MY REVIEW....If you don't want to know some key plot points, well, skip to another review.]Like many people here, I grew up on Star Wars back ""in the day"", when it was just a trilogy.  Fast-forward to 1999, and the hype-filled release of Lucas' first prequel installment, Episode I: The Phantom Menace.  To be blunt, it was a disappointment which was only saved from being a total loss by the distinctive presence of the Star Wars aesthetic, and by the ambition of its storyline.  Another sci-fi movie launched that summer, called ""The Matrix"", and its legions of hipster fanboys laughed and pointed at The Phantom Menace's wooden acting, poor dialogue, off-kilter pacing, and....Jar Jar Binks.  Of course, it was the release of 2001's Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring which resulted in a more relevant movie for comparison, as (like Star Wars) the Lord of the Rings movies were made to be timeless, and not to cash in on trendy Hot Topic fashions and hastily assimilated Hong Kong cinema gunplay.  2002 saw the release of Episode II: Attack of the Clones, which was one step forward and one-half step back.  While Hayden Christiansen's acting was less painful to watch than that of Jake Lloyd (who, to be fair, was a child actor, and didn't have the chops that only time can bring), it was still pretty wooden, and Natalie Portman's acting wasn't exactly lighting up the screen either.  In fact, the dialogue was just as wooden, with a few exceptions.  However, the settings were better, the action was more over the top, and the last 40 minutes saw the reappearance of some of that old-school Star Wars spirit.With Episode 2 ending with the Jedi leading the proto-Stormtrooper clone army into the Clone Wars, yet still failing to ascertain the true plot unfolding around them, expectations were high for Episode III.  Lucas obscured things even further by dropping hints that the epic action of the movie would be limited to the very beginning.  By the beard of Zeus, could it be true?  Would he let us down with his last chance to send off the saga on a high note?  Thankfully, the trailers finally began to emerge, and it was clear that there was more to Episode 3 than Lucas let on.First, I do have to point out ""the bad"".  There is still too much wooden acting, although performances have improved greatly.  Sadly, some of the worst acting occurs during the critical juncture immediately prior to the Anakin/Obi-Wan lightsaber duel.  Nonetheless, the timing and general feel are less stilted in this movie.  Additionally, Lucas also sometimes overindulges his need to show off ILM's abilities, most notably by having Count Dooku perform a ridiculous and unnecessary flip maneuver simply to bypass walking calmly down some stairs.  Finally, there are still some loose ends and plot holes left in the prequels, including Jedi Master Syfo-Dias' true role, and how the Jedi could be so incredibly blind to the presence of Order 66 in the military training programs that they would have been in some capacity overseeing.The good news is that somehow, this movie makes up for it with a more real and engaging presentation than the other prequel movies.  In fact, in this case, more IS more, and it's obvious that George Lucas studied the Lord of the Rings movies, which, of course, owe their own debt in turn to Star Wars, which of course owes its own debt to Tolkien's source material.  But, I digress.  The movie starts off with a bang, to say the least, as Anakin and Obi-Wan race their starfighters over the surface of a proto-Star Destroyer to the sound of pounding war drums, and dive headfirst into what is revealed to be a titanic space battle over Coruscant.  The movie continues full-throttle through an extended opening action sequence reminiscent of both the James Bond and Indiana Jones movies.  After this sequence, which includes vertiginous elevator sequences, a lightsaber duel, a close quarters brawl in the enemy command ship's bridge, and a tense, out-of-control landing, it seems as if the movie will settle back into the familiar, boring pace of its prequel predecessors.Not quite, this time.  As our heroes return to Coruscant, and the business of assessing the ongoing Clone Wars, the tension begins to build, and is artfully reflected in the visuals and the lighting.  With the outward focus shifting to the cyborg General Grevious, and an ongoing Separatist assault on the Wookie homeworld, there are still some obvious action-driven plot threads which serve to break up the Byzantine and internal intrigues which rear their heads up during the first half of the movie.  With Anakin beginning to have disturbing dreams about the fate of the now-pregnant Padme (his secret wife), he is put in the unenviable position of being asked to spy on one of his surrogate father figures, the dubious Chancellor Palpatine, by his OTHER father figure, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  In turn, Palpatine sows the seeds of doubt in Anakin's mind about the morality and wisdom of the Jedi, by preying on Anakin's secret fears about Padme's life.  Throughout the first half, the tension is constantly being built, and is only matched by the viewer's curiosity as to how the bottom will drop out for the Republic and the Jedi.Finally, things take a turn for the worse when the mastermind Darth Sidious reveals himself, and Anakin is forced into making the ultimate wrong choice, in part due to the Jedi Order's own emotionally stunted state and questionable decision-making.  After that point, things free fall, and the majority of the Jedi Order is wiped out during a planet-hopping, wartime montage that is part ""Godfather"" and part ""Saving Private Ryan"".  Through carefully laid, long-term plans coming to fruition, the Jedi are disgraced, and the Republic's politicians gladly sacrifice Lady Liberty on the altar of ""security"", as the Republic is folded into a Galactic Empire.  All that remains are the inevitable confrontations between Anakin and Obi-Wan, and Yoda and the Emperor, while the fate of Padme and her children hang in the balance.  The twin lightsaber duels are pretty impressive, and the protracted ending chapters set up the second half of the Star Wars saga fairly well, if not without a few bumps.  It's too bad the other two prequels were not as well executed, as the story arc setup from them did deserve better treatment.The visuals and audio were top-notch in the theaters, and translate pretty well to the DVD format.  Obviously, the scale will not be on par with what you get at the cinema, but the transfer is clean and intact, displaying how vivid digitally recorded movies can be if properly done.  Compared to Episodes I and II, Episode III feels much less flat, perhaps because real life sets were used more extensively this time around, and also perhaps due to the inevitable technology improvements.  As a result, while the CGI is still obviously ""not real"", it is used more artfully, and conveys an incredibly surreal feeling, akin to work done in Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.  The lighting is more varied, more subtle, and more ""solid"", for lack of a better word.  The colors are vivid, and leap off the screen, while the audio bombards the listener with John Williams' score, combined with Ben Burtt's trademark sound effects (including buzzing lightsabers, elastic laser blasts, and the infamous ""Wilhelm scream"").The extras include the usual deleted scenes, mostly relating to the political aspect of the storyline.  Why George Lucas couldn't find a way to insert some of that material into the actual movie is beyond me, although it would admittedly slow the pace a bit too much.  The commentary is, for me, a disappointment.  More time is spent discussing effects than addressing some of the story points not explicitly seen in the movies.  With Lucas's commentary, some definitive answers could have been provided, but weren't.  Instead, we get some vague generalizations from George, some goofy behind-the-scenes stories, and the like.  Some of the other extras are more substantial, such as a series of mini-documentaries, and the gamut of trailers and TV ads, which were some of the most effective Star Wars promos to date.  It's too bad there aren't any comments from the actors, as with the right combinations, you can get entertaining results in a commentary (e.g. Dina Meyer/Neil Patrick Harris/Casper Van Dien in ""Starship Troopers"", Arnold Schwartzenegger/John Milius in ""Conan the Barbarian"", and anytime you combine John Carpenter and Kurt Russell).Revenge of the Sith has been the subject of a fair amount of controversy among both reviewers and its movie fanatic fanbase.  Websites like CHUD were abuzz with revisionists claiming that the much reviled Episode I was better than Episode III, while on Usenet, apologists for the prequels claimed that ""Star Wars always had poor dialogue"" (despite the fact that the original trilogy's fairly simple syntax flowed pretty well, especially compared to the ""thee and thou"" style weighing down the prequels).  Some professional reviewers, such as Rolling Stone's Peter ""Hey, Monster In Law is a great movie!"" Travers viewed Episode III as the last chance to trash a Star Wars movie, while others lauded Episode III's epic scope, and relevance to modern politics.  Fanboy wars, of course, were stoked, with Star Wars and Lord of the Rings zealots viewing moviegoing as a ""zero sum game""; there can be only one, right?  In the end, though, Episode III has to succeed as a cinematic experience, irrespective of one's emotional attachment.  Thankfully, for all its flaws, Episode III: Revenge of the Sith ends up being more than the sum of its parts.

I have been a dedicated fan of the originals, and like many, I cursed the horror of Episode one, I was disgruntled by ""The Clone Wars"", and I fully anticipated a bout of depression after Lucas butchered Episode Three.  However, having just returned from the theater, because no matter what, I was going to pay to see the movie at near release date, I find myself in a quandry.  I have none of the emotions I expected; I am, in fact, very happy with Ep. 3.Truly, this is the sort of thing I had hoped for in the prequels!  The acting was, largely, of Star Wars quality, but that's fine; Mark Hammil and Carrie Fisher were not exactly Oscar caliber actors either.  Star Wars always relied on a simple and identifiable storyline and dazzling special effects to make its impact.  ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a an impressive special effects display; the fight choreography was spectacular, and the only way it could have met the dark expectations and imaginings I had for it would have been to make it rated ""R"", so I can't fault that.As a disappointed Star Wars fan, I have to admit, the Sith not only defeated the Republic, the Sith won over a horribly skeptical viewer.  I haven't been this pleased since ""Empire"".The only spoiler I will give is this... because it will make so many people so happy...

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1DQC5LI8VC3CT	"J. Howell ""Philosopher"""	When the original Star Wars (Episode IV: A New Hope) first played in theaters, I was only 2 years old.  I remember seeing both A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back on T.V. just weeks before I saw Return of the Jedi in theaters with my Aunt, Uncle and cousins in 1983.  I became an instant Star Wars addict.  I was already out of High School before I knew that George Lucas had a whole back story planned for film, and I must say I was thrilled to learn of the prequel trilogy that was to come.  Now, having viewed all six films, I am thoroughly satisfied and an even more avid Star Wars fan.  Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, brought it all together.  This chapter in the six part series literally brought me to tears as I watched the gut wrenching transformation of Anakin Skywalker into Sith Lord Darth Vader.  After watching this, I immediately returned home and watched the original trilogy and was brought to new heights of ecstatic glory.  When you finally see Return of the Jedi after watching Revenge of the Sith, you realize that the prophecy concerning Anakin Skywalker is indeed true.........it is ultimately Anakin Skywalker (still in the armor of Darth Vader), rather than his son Luke, who destroys the evil Sith Lord Darth Sidious (Emperor Palpatine, or, simply, the Emperor.)  Anakin does, in fact, become the prophetic Jedi who restores order to the Force.......it takes his son, however, to bring this about.  Watch Revenge of the Sith and then go back and watch Return of the Jedi and you will be brought to tears with the reality of what has happened!  These movies become a spiritual moment when viewed as a whole!  All of this has left me wondering if the title Return of the Jedi refers to Luke Skywalker bringing the heritage of the Jedi into a new era, OR, if it refers to Anakin Skywalker being returned to the ranks of the Jedi after being loosed from the evil bonds of the Sith.  These are philosophical thoughts to ponder!  Maybe someday Lucas will let us all know.By the way.......why is the term Sith never mentioned in ANY of the three original movies??  Just curious.	5.0	The Saga Finally Comes Full Circle	2005-08-17	4	3	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3P616ODTG032L	J. Hudgens	"[...]Let me just say that this film is worse than bad.  It is insulting to one's intelligence.  Lucas would have us believe that great special effects can make up for bad acting, directing, and script writing.  Lucas said as much in an interview, that he doesn't care as much for the acting and writing as he does for the visuals.  I'm not buying it.  This movie plays out as if Lucas called all the actors in for one or two takes on each scene and then called it a day, whereby he retreated to his computers.  I feel like what I watched was some sort of rough draft and thanks to this film I'm utterly sick of Star Wars now.  Ken Lay didn't become the evil CEO of Enron in the space of a few hours so why should Anakin get to throw the cloak of darkness over the universe in what seemed like 30 minutes?  Whatever happened to hard work and not having everything handed to you on a silver platter?  But in the tradition of Star Wars finally coming to an end, let's recap the cheesiest lines from each film which are consequently the cheesiest lines ever to make it to the big screen:From Episode I:""The ability to speak does not make you intelligent."" (really?)This is tied with the horrendous ""Yippeeeee!""From Episode II:""I hate sand. It's coarse and irritating and it gets everywhere.  Everything here is soft and smooth.""This line gives new meaning to the word ""cringe.""From Episode III:""You are so beautiful.""""It's only because I'm so in love.""""No, it's because I'm in love with you.""""So love has blinded you?""""Well that's not exactly what I meant.""""It's probably true.""Somebody please take Lucas's pen away.And in a galaxy in the very distant future, Luke Skywalker will realize what a putz his father was, renounce his Jedi heritage, and retire to the planet of Zinboo to sell real estate and open a chain of intergalactic strip clubs.[...]"	1.0	Review: Episode III	2005-11-15	58	42	16
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A258O0KFLNZBSC	Jigen	"This was a perfect end to the most popular fantasy film series in history. It's a tragedy and pure allegory, a method of storytelling unfortunately under-produced these days; within the framework of an exciting story, cautionary lessons are revealed.Mirroring and intertwined with the fall of the Republic is Anakin Skywalker. Full of promise and power, he becomes greedy for more. His insecurity and sense of exceptionalism corrupts him and leads him to turn his back on everything he's ever known and loved. Of the entire series this film is the most emotionally intense, as we follow the Republic and its hero into the depths of darkness.That's the theme in a nutshell, the fall of a hero. When folk complain about dialog, they are missing the point (as well as betraying the limits of their film education - what about mis en scene? theme? editing? color usage? imagery?, etc.) The dialog and acting fit in with the rest of the series, that is, they aren't strong or central. The characters are archetypal, painted with broad strokes and superficial. People who want only superior dialog and nuanced acting typically avoid American films.This film returns us to some of the original thoughts and questions that prompted Mr Lucas back when he began the saga: why do republics tend to fall into dictatorships? (Remember, the Vietnam War was raging and we were ruled by Nixon in those days.) Much has been written on the political significance of this film, mainly by Bush-apologists who are afraid it's about their guy. It isn't. That they so easily thought it was, however, speaks volumes.This story is bigger than one little president, even if there are stark similarities between the presented dark idealogy and the political climate we've sunk into - needless wars, lust for greater power, favoring resolve over goodness, and the Orwellian spoken love of democracy and freedom while all the time scaling it back. Words and ideas, such as dealing in absolutes, ""if you're not with me..."", ""I AM the senate"", etc. should be criticised when leaders and governments hide behind them, not when fictional films reveal them. This is, after all, a cautionary story.The film's messages might be lost on the older generation who identified with the Rebels against the Empire, but perhaps the allegory will live within the hearts of the younger generation, some of whom will one day lead this country. Perhaps they can help our own republic stand, not fall. Democracy thrives on courage, fascism feeds on fear.All in all a fun, yet somber, film."	5.0	Good Conclusion	2005-08-02	18	15	3

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2A6NH6DPE0VXR	"Jim ""Pimmy"""	"StarWars: Revenge of the Sith is one of the best StarWars movies. When  I saw Attack of the Clones I thought that was the best next to The Empire Strikes Back. I thought that was Lucas showing he can still do StarWars. No though, Revenge of the Sith is a real StarWars movie. It still has George Lucas' bad dialogue of course. There's more action than there is talking though thank god. When you think of it though, A New Hope didn't have the best dialogue either. Although the late great Alec Guinness was nominated for playing Obi-Wan, it's said that he hated the lines he had to say. Hey at least he had better lines than Natalie Portman does.Anyway there's tons and tons of action and Lucas' pacing isn't that bad this time around. I mean in Phantom Menace, it had it's lame moments when there was huge scenes of just dialogue and no action. The weakest parts are when Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Padm&eacute; (Natalie Portman) express their love to each other but at least those scenes are short. Hearing lines like ""hold me like you did in Naboo"", will make you cringe but they aren't enough to ruin the movie.  Hayden Christensen's scenes with Ian McDiarmid ""The Emperor/Palpatine"" are far better. He seduces Anakin to the darkside cleverly. He feeds his ego by calling him the best and saying it's a pity how the Jedi hold him back. Also he tells him that powers of the dark side will save Padme since Anakin fears her death.This is the only StarWars prequel to my knowledge that people in the audience actually applauded to more than once while watching. They loved Yoda's action scenes as did I. Everyone seemed to be entertained more during Yoda's fight with the Emperor than the Anakin/Obi-Wan fight as well. I think that is the most enertaining fight. Obi-Wan's fight with General Grievous is very well done as well. Grievous holds the Lightsabers of Jedis he killed and fights Obi-Wan with 4 at a time at one point. Anakin's fight with Count Dooku isn't bad as well. The look on Dooku's face when Palpatine tells Anakin to kill him is priceless.Lucas is good at structuring a script ""even if he can't write dialogie for his life"" and he does his best job here. He fits everything in there well. He answers almost every question you may ask. Like for example why doesn't 3-3P0 tell Luke in a New Hope that he knew his father ?  He also made this the most violent and darkest of the six films. There's scenes with kid Jedis even getting killed. There's also some limbs getting cutting off from time to time. Still though it was obvious even long before this movie came out that it would be dark. I mean Anakin becomes Darth Vader and you know all the Jedis but Obi-Wan and Yoda will die. Revenge of the Sith fills in the final gap of the StarWars trilogy and it's done very well. This is a prequel that doesn't disapoint, it's exciting and not lame and is actually worth waiting on line for days and days for."	4.0	A StarWars Prequel that doesn't disapoint	2005-05-19	7	6	1

There's something left here in this franchise, right?There is a heartbeat here. If you can hear it through the clutter of Jedi Counsel del iberations, Mace Windoo doing his haughty strutting thing, and ignore the Chase of General Emphysema On a Lizard thing, you can watch and enjoy this movie. Hey. I'm here to help.We all wanted to see Yoda and Obi Wan do that fighter pilot thing, and here we finally do. The filmmakers owed us, big time, for the wretched Yoda performance of Episode II (""Dawson's Creek in Space""), which looked like it had been choreographed by the same guys who did ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" and shot by a team of CG artists instead of photographers. Hence, the camera work and fight choreography are vastly improved over Episode II.The plot is still loopy and ridiculous. (In a cut scene, we see that Padme took part in a high school Model UN to prepare her for her role as elected Queen. Yes. Really.) Never mind that. We want to see how Anakin became Darth, and that's saved for the Last Battle. Aside from the fact that Padme tells Anakin ""I don't know you anymore,"" (WHAT?!), the battle is epic, sweeping, well choreographed, scored, and cut, it pays off big at the end and you get to see Anakin fully transformed into the bloodless and wrathful Darth. (Although he does yell ""Noooooooo"", which subtracts somewhat.)Lucas tried to wrap up a lot of things here, and there are a lot of skeins left lying around and aren't really tied up. Leah goes to live on Alderaan (we knew it as her adopted world) and Luke is busted back to Tatooine. Obi Wan goes there, too, to ""look after"" Luke from afar. In a bizarre moment, Yoda gives Obi Wan a calling card so he can hook up with Qui Gon. Okay, it's more like meditation, but does that make it better?Episode II left all us True Believers in a trance and desperate to salvage anything from the series gone amok.

McGinn ""HUNTSMAN"""	"Well here we are with Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith the last of the Star Wars prequel trilogy and the last of the live action Star War films. The two trilogy's have had their ups and downs with plot holes, bad character development, miscasting and some bad acting, but the trilogy's and Lucas have gave us great stories, great characters, special effects, action and lasting impact on Hollywood and popular culture collimating in Revenge of the Sith and what is perhaps the best Star Wars film made. Like The Empire Strikes Back Revenge of the Sith has some minor flaws with one or two tiny plot holes, and pacing, but the film is still a superb 5 star film with great acting performances, special effects, story, action that culminates in a stunning and outstanding climax.The story starts off with the Clone Wars in full swing and Separatists have taken Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) hostage. Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) set out to rescue the chancellor leading them to a fight with Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). Dooku is killed and the two Jedi rescue the Chancellor, but General Grievous (voice by Matthew Wood) escapes. Afterward Anakin meets his pregnant wife Padme and is placed on the Jedi council by the chancellor who has wormed his way into Anakin's heart and mind. The chemistry between Anakin and Padme is better, but not a major step up. Even with his status as a member on the Jedi Council he isn't given the rank of a Jedi master, which upsets Anakin and makes things even easier for Palpatine. While Anakin is stuck on Coruscant dealing with his rejection and resentment toward the council Obi-Wan tracks down Grievous to Utapau and a large battle ensues while back on Coruscant Anakin confides in Palpatine of his dreams of his wife's death and Palpatine reveals that he's a Sith Lord seducing the young Jedi by giving him a path to saving Padme and again confirming that the Jedi council doesn't respect and fears him, and even tells Anakin to tell the Jedi council about him. This leads to a confrontation between Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and a few other Jedi Knights. When it looks like Mace is going to kill the Palpatine Anakin arrives and interferes giving the Sith Lord a chance to strike at the Jedi Knight knocking out the window killing him, and then with most of the veteran Jedi Knights dead or abroad fighting in the Clone War, and Anakin now his disciple the Sith Lord brings to an end his ""long con"" with Order 66 which is an order to the Clone army to kill all the Jedi Knights abroad while Anakin handles the ones in the Jedi temple. Abroad all the Jedi Knights are believed to be killed (If I remember correctly some survived in the comics and novels, but I could be wrong.) leaving only Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi alive. Yoda tasks reluctant Obi-Wan to deal with Anakin while he deals with Palpatine. After talking with Padme Anakin sneaks aboard Padme's ship and finds Anakin on volcanic planet of Mustafar. A battle takes begins between these on time friends while on Coruscant Yoda and Palpatine fight and Yoda ending up fleeing. Back on Mustafar Obi-Wan defeats Anakin and leaves him for dead thinking his onetime apprentice and friend would die, but the now emperor finds him while Padme gives birth to Luke and Leia and dies while Anakin is turned into Darth Vader.The story is excellent. Lucas did a great job with it. I know he wrote the story of the two trilogies with Anakin and Luke as the lead characters, but I truly believe the story of the prequel was actually Obi-Wan's story. He was the most compelling character and his journey was a sad one as he basically lost everything and everyone he cared about. The same is for the original trilogy which I believe isn't Luke's journey but Han's journey. Were the a couple flaws yes. Like the beginning duel with Count Dooku. I know we all know he was going to die, but I thought Lucas could have done a better job with that. Was the chemistry between Anakin and Padme better than what was in the Attack of the Clones yes, but I still didn't buy that a woman like Padme would deal with Anakin, but that's me. These are only minor complaints to what is a great plot. The relationship between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker was great in this film and the climatic scenes between them were awesome. I knew Mace Windu was going to die, but it was still sad. He was such a great character. Palpatine also got much more screen time as he revealed himself to be a Sith Lord and he was great.Speaking of Palpatine Ian McDiarmid does a masterful job with his expanded role and the culminating of his master plan. All the actors did an above average to an excellent job. Jackson again brought his awesomeness to the role of Mace Windu while Hayden Christensen gave his best film performance to date though that isn't saying much since it was only above average, and he still seemed stiff and robot like. Natalie Portman was again really good. Well who wouldn't like her she has beauty and brains, but she doesn't a really good job as Padme torn between her good friend Obi-Wan and her husband and the man she supposedly loves in Anakin. Matthew Wood does a decent job voicing Grevious though the character wasn't that compelling. The one time NYPD Blue actor Jimmy Smits did a good job with his small role as Bail Organa and adoptive father to Leia. Frank Oz gives perhaps his best voice performance as Yoda again bringing to life the character he has done in five Star Wars films. Saving the best for last is Ewan McGregor who really steals the show throughout the prequels with his excellent performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi. I've already expressed my views on his part in the prequels and his role in them. He is my favorite actor and character in the prequels.You know what I'm going to say ILM did an excellent job with the special effects in the film and they did. Outside of the small flaw I mention earlier the action was superb with the best being the climax. The lightsaber battles between Yoda and Palpatine, and Obi-Wan and Anakin was riveting, and in my opinion the best lightsaber battles of all the Star Wars films. They were beautiful choreographed with special effects. Plus with the special effects and the performances by the actors makes them the best. With this most likely being the last live action Star Wars film Lucas gives his best performance as director bring together the acting, effects and music almost perfectly. Of course you can't mention a Star Wars film without John Williams who gave us one of the climatic scores in film.Is Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith the best Star Wars film? As I said in my review for The Empire Strikes Back that is hard for me. Right now I'd say no that Strikes Back is the best, but ask me a few weeks or months from now I might say Revenge of the Sith is the best. Regardless Revenge of the Sith is one of the top two Star War films with an almost perfect story, great acting, excellent special effects, almost perfect action, really good directing and great music. Revenge of the Sith is a great ending to the live action Star Wars films. The Lucas and the prequels did a remarkable job fixing the mistakes of the previous trilogy and expanding their universe by giving us a compelling story and characters.Ranking of the Star War films1.

Murdoch ""Creative Sparkplug"""	I suspect how most people will rate the latest (and last) installation of George Lucus' Star Wars saga will depend on whether or not you have a good memory of seeing the very first film (now no. 4) in the theaters.If you're old enough to remember seeing the first star wars in theaters (I was 16 when it came out), I don't know how you could not be disapointed. Of course, my expectations were pretty low to begin with given how awful I and II were but I hoped, somehow, that given the magnitude of the tragedy, III would rise a bit more to the occasion.Just to make sure episode IV was THAT GOOD, I rented it from Blockbuster and watched it with my 8-year old. Yep, it was that good and a better set up for episode III you couldn't ask for. You have Sir Alec Guiness as Obi Wan Kenobi setting up our expectations for Anakin Starwalker. The elderly Obi Wan speaks of Anakin with reverence and awe and there is still anguish in his voice when he tells Luke how his father was betrayed and killed.So, it's hard not to want the character of Anakin to be worthy of the reverence and feeling expressed by the elderly Obi Wan. Unfortunately, Anakin as played by Hayden Christensen isn't much more than the sulky, bratty kid he was in Episode II.It's not just the character of Anakin Skywalker that fails to develop. All of the actors seem more or less to be walking through their lines. I honestly felt no sadness or sense of remorse at an ending that is Shakespean is its magnitude.Like the episodes I and II, the real stars in the film are the special effects. The actors are there just to move the plot along.If there's a graphic novel or comic book that covers this material in more depth than in the film, I would recommend checking out those options before watching this stylish but ultimately low-on-substance film.BTW, the official Star Wars III novel that was released at about the same time as the film isn't much more than the screenplay filled out with technical details.Too bad. It's still a great story, just not one well told.	2.0	Loose ends get tidied up for part IV; Otherwise a waste	2005-06-04	11	7	4

What initially stemmed from selflessness -- love for another living entity and the blinded passion to rescue the other from certain death (fate) -- is ultimately recognized as the epitomy of selfishness -- false arrogance, excessive self-love, and a singular quest for power and self-aggrandizement.Via digital technology brilliance, the movie displays the mental and physical acrobatics of a man's self-deception about love...In the end, Anakin's singular and blinded passion to rescue the woman he loves from certain death is the ""dark force"" which plunges him into the abyss of evil."	5.0	Star Wars III: A Romantic Interlude	2005-05-29	8	3	5

Anakin has risen to the rank of Jedi Knight,  while Obi Won has risen to the rank of General.  The movie opens with a spectacular space battle and goes into another excellent battle with General Grievous' droids.  After that,  the centerpoint of the movie,  Anakin,  begins to feel great angst towards the Jedi Knights.Eventually Anakin falls to the dark side,  killing many Jedi Knights which is gut wrenching to watch.  And his climactic battle with Obi Won at the end leaves him horribly burned and he must be fitted with a suit that will enable him to survive.  And the malevolent Darth Vader is born.  Of course Luke and Leia are separated and Obi Won and Yoda go into exile.In closing,  it is without a doubt the best of the 6 Star Wars movies,  but there is a lot of violence and very sad happenings...its not your typical good time Star Wars movie.

George Lucas has lost his ability as a director and screen writer. He seems more concerned about special effects than the story. I really hope the new Indiana Jones movie will not suffer the same fate.With that being said I do feel that Episode 3 is the best of the prequels however. The dialogue is still horrible but the movie is darker and the story plays out nicely during the second half of the film. One of the brightest areas of the movie is Ian McDiarmid who played Palpatine. I was impressed by his acting ability. Imagine what his preformance would have been with a better director and script. Saddly Ian's acting made Hayden Christensen's (Anakin/Vader)acting look terrible due to the large amount of joint screen time.One area where Lucas hit the mark was with depicting Vader as a real bad guy. He didn't hold back once Anakin crossed over to the dark side. By the end I really wanted Obi-Wan to kick his a$$. So if you are one of the people who refused to watch Episode III because of the other prequels, I recommend watching it once and giving it a chance. Do not expect it to be as good as Empire Strikes Back but thats really impossible anyway.	4.0	The best of the prequels...	2006-01-13	5	3	2

But here in the latest installment of Star Wars, Lucas restored order to the theatrical world as we know it with non-stop action, in-depth plot, and a script that will have you on the edge of your seat.In Episode Three, the balance of the universe hangs on one man's decision, that of Anakin Skywalker. The Jedi want him to spy of Councelor Palpatin, and Palpatin, who has much greater things in mind as we well know by this point, wants Anakin for himself.Because of prophetic dreams involving the death of his wife, young Skywalker learns that the dark side of the force is so powerful that it can even restore life. Palpatine instructs Anakin of the dark side and its many perks and Anakin, humiliated by having a place on the Jedi council but not granted rank of Jedi Master, begins to slowly turn......The Jedi, having been strategically spread all over the galaxy, are in their most vulnerable position. When news arrives to a faction of Jedi about the grand plot and the true identity of the Sith Lord, their lines of communication and coordination are at its weakest.This is a sad film. It's hard to endure as you watch what you knew had to happen for episodes four through six to take place. Two valiant battle scenes at the end of the film surpass 98% of the scenes we've witnessed in Episodes 1,2,4,5, and yes, even 6. Yoda is shown in his full power, as is the emperor, and their battle on the throne of the senate floor will be one of the greatest scenes in the series history. CHEWBACCA makes a warm appearance, as does the infamous JaJa Binks(don't worry, it only lasts about two seconds!).All in all, Samuel L. Jackson was right when he said, ""This is the one."" I'd rate it right there with Return of the Jedi. The intensity is hard to stomach and children should stay at home. Not for them, but for us. Three little brats kept screaming all throughout the film. What were their parents thinking? Lucas warned us, and rightly so.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3VV4GUGLUVUP1	Joel R. Bryan	"George Lucas concludes his prequel trilogy (Wow... I want to punch the phrase ""prequel trilogy"") with ""Star Wars Episode III:  Revenge of the Sith.""  It's better than the first two, but baby, that ain't saying much!Things also better than ""Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones"" include doing laundry, eating a Hot Pocket with pepperoni, watching ""Just Shoot Me"" in syndication, and reading a ""People"" magazine with a cover story on Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  We're talking lowered expectations and the Law of Diminishing Returns.In ""Revenge,"" after two movies of flailing around pointlessly, we finally get to the actual story.  Here, Anakin Skywalker (this time played by iHayden Christianson, a computer-generated creature that almost manages to convince us of its humanity) turns to the Dark Side in what would've been an operatically tragic fall from grace... if he'd ever been graceful in the first place.  Meanwhile, his space-diplomat girlfriend Natalie Portman regresses into a weepy, hand-wringing nag (from Portman's consistently bored performances in the prequels you can tell she just wants to cash her Lucasfilm checks and get back to making real movies with Mike Nichols).If you thought their love scenes in ""Attack of the Clones"" were cartoonishly laughable, be prepared for more snickering as romance novel-haired Anakin preens shirtlessly and Padme wails ""You're breaking my heart!"" with all the conviction of a Nintendo princess.While they're trying to out-wooden each other, Obi-Wan is flying through space, working his Jedi backside off trying to save the galaxy from one of the many i-characters, wheezy General Grievous, yet another ""Wars"" denizen doomed to villiany because his parents picked a name out of the ""Big Book of Evil Baby Names"" book instead of just calling him Joshua like everyone else did that year.Meanwhile, iYoda hangs out with his new best friend Chewbacca (didn't see that one coming), and a lot of iJedi people lose very important body parts.  Oh, and droids and other intergalactic weirdos cavort across your screen in numerous dance numbers and/or video game levels.Unfortunately, most of the story exists only in the tv cartoons or  various novels, comic books and magazine articles.  It's amazing how this scant an idea has grown where it can no longer be contained in the actual running time of the movie itself, but has to be spread out over all the biographical blurbs on the backs of action figure packaging.But this third one does have its moments, especially right at the end when lightsabers ignite and Darth Vader starts killing people and familiar characters finally appear.  Plus, Ian McDiarmid delightfully chews the scenery as Palpatine, giving the material the tongue-in-cheek menace it deserves.  And long-suffering Ewan McGregor continues actually to act in his role as Kenobi, almost as if he were in a real movie.If you endured- er- saw the first two, you owe it to yourself to see this one if only to flush out the bad taste.  The DVD is full of extras about how meticulously the crew worked on all the planets and creatures.  No one works harder at this stuff than the ILM elves and their Santa-like boss Georgie anyway, so maybe you should just watch them in their quest to make the perfect CGI alien texture, or the perfect CGI image of an exploding droid general's billowing cape and skip the feature.More effort went into that than into either iHayden's or Natalie Portman's entire performances and the cape acts rings around them anyway!"	3.0	They Misspelled One Word in the Title...	2005-12-14	3	0	3

From start to finish it is non stop action packed adventure with all of our favorite characters.  Obi Wan continues to train his student and friend, Anakin Skywalker, who is slowly being manipulated by the dark side of the force.  Things like the birth of his child to Padme and his rejection of becoming a master on the Jedi Council fuel his conflicts.  The dark lord of the Sith continues to trick him as the Clone Wars rage on.  Battles comense on the Planet Kashyyk, the Wookie homeworld, while Obi Wan ventures to Uthapra to confront General Grevious, the leader of the Separists Droid army.  Many exciting jedi battles occur in this film;  Obi Wan and Anakin vs. Count Dooku, Mace Windu and the few Jedi Council Members vs. Darth Sidious, Obi Wan vs. General Grevious, Yoda vs. Darth Sidious, and the final inevitable battle between Obi Wan and Anakin.  This movie goes everywhere.  From the space battles above Corascent, to the engaging battles on Kashyyk, to the clone attack on Uthapra, to the anhialation of all the Jedi.  It's a powerful movie that every Star Wars fan will love, and any regular movie goer who just loves a great movie should see.  By the way, R2-D2 kick android tail in this flick.  I wonder why he isn't so inventive and crazy in the original trilogy?  Anyways, not to write any spoilers, but I will tell you this; ANAKIN SKYWALKER BECOMES DARTH VADER!!!  Oh I'm sorry, did I ruin that for you? Sorry about that.  Also you see Luke and Leia being born just before Padme kicks the bucket, which leads to an awesome emotional scene of Darth Vader.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	"It was half of a really great movie.  There is no real secret as to what ""Revenge of the Sith"" is about: the fall of Anakin Skywalker.  The Rise of Darth Vader.  How does the boy who yelled ""yippee"" in ""The Phantom Menace"" turn into the monster who crushes the windpipes of those who displease him?  For Star Wars fans, this is what we've been waiting to see ever since we first saw ""Star Wars"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"".As someone who actually enjoyed the political talk in Episodes I and II, the first half of this movie sort of dragged for me.  The opening space battle and rescue of Palpatine wasn't as fantastic as I had hoped, though the special effects were beautiful.  Actually, the special effects and the visuals in this movie were stunning all the way through.  This is the best looking Star Wars movie and the effects here will be put to good use in other films.  But the opening felt forced to me.  It didn't engage, but when Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) are together and Palpatine is starting to seduce Anakin with the Dark Side and how it can protect Padme (Natalie Portman) and even bring peace to the galaxy, the movie works.  From this point on, when Anakin begins to distrust the Jedi and slips closer and closer to the Dark Side I am totally into what is happening on screen.Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi is especially good here as he seems to be channeling Alec Guinness.  His final confrontation with Anakin is probably the moment that fans have been waiting for and we feel the pain and betrayal that each character feels, and with the prequels it is amazing that we feel anything from any character.There are other parts of this movie that does not work.  As always, George Lucas's dialogue is rather poor and the ""romantic"" exchanges between Anakin and Padme and cringe inducing if you think about it for any length of time.  Mercifully they are rather short scenes.  Then again, most of the dialogue in the movie makes some awfully good actors sound, well, awful.  Ewan McGregor comes off better than most as the movie progresses.  It feels like he is having more fun playing the role than he has in two previous movies.""Revenge of the Sith"" answers many questions raised by Star Wars fans over the years, but leaves others unanswered.  The one that still gets me is how exactly does someone so powerful in the Force (Anakin) not know that his wife is carrying twins?  A follow up would question the wisdom of hiding Darth Vader's son on his home planet of Tatooine, but I suppose there would be no reason for Vader to return to Tatooine.In the end ""Revenge of the Sith"" is satisfying for the Star Wars fan, though by no means is it perfect.  Having only seen the movie once and not knowing how it will hold up after six months or a year, it feels like I like it third best after ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Star Wars"".Maybe after seeing the movie a second time (probably on DVD) the first half will grow on me and the whole movie will feel stronger, but that second half is worth the price of admission.-Joe Sherry"	4.0	like Snickers, this one mostly satisfies	2005-05-23	6	3	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3LX5HJUVX8IX7	Joey Saylor	"I've just finished viewing the movie and it was nothing short of spectacular. From the beginning to the end, the movie has your undivided attention. The action, acting and effects were dead on. The surprise of the movie is Hayden Christensen. It was as if he had become someone else, both literally and figuratively in the movie. He was very convincing on his delivery and came across as very believable. His ""I Hate You!!!"" to Obi-Wan at the end of their duel was one of the best lines of all. Other very notable performances are from Ian McDiarmid, especially in his duel with the four Jedi and Samuel Jackson. Not to mention nearly destroying Yoda! Also Ewan McGregor who would make Alec Guiness proud with his performance.The pace of the movie is fast, and much of the first half is dialogue setting up the events that occur in the second half. Basically boiling down to very good storytelling. Those who would criticize George Lucas for his writing and inability to construct a plot might have to shut up at this point. But I doubt they will. Go figure.Other scenes that steal the show are of course all the duels (Anakin slicing off Dooku's hands especially, got a great reaction from the audience) and the simulataneous scenes of the birth of Luke and Leia shown with Darth Vader's construction. Many critics have been all over Vader's initial dialogue and reaction to Padme's death. Totally unfounded. This scene comes across great (James Earl Jones' ""Noooooo!"" executed flawlessly) and spells the end of Anakin Skywalker for good. Look for the scene when he is on the bridge with the Emperor and Governor Tarkin. The effects people (or makeup people, I can't tell yet) did an excellent job of creating a young looking Peter Cushing.Everyone's opinion will differ, but as someone who grew up on the original trilogy I have to break from the pack and say this movie ranks right up there with them. I'd even go as far to say on a storytelling level and dramatic acting, it surpasses them all. BTW the only criticism I do have is that the special effects are definately more suited for a digital screen. Regular projection screens make much of the CGI look right out of a video game. So keep that in mind when you go see it.In closing, thank you George Lucas for ending Star Wars on the right terms!"	5.0	Meets and exceeds  expectations!	2005-05-19	4	4	0
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A13KTP9IMUU9FN	John Bacon	"Overall, I would say that this is one of the best Star Wars movies in the saga.  It has all the humor, suspense, and special effects all rolled in one movie.  The very first opening sequence was so  jam-packed with effects that no matter how many times you watch  it you would always see something new.  The lightsaber battles were also very amazing.  Some people say that they tried to make it to overwhelming so they do all those flips and stuff so it just looks stupid compared to the originals.  But in the originals the only jedi that were really dueling were crippled old men and young amatuer men (ex: Obi-Wan and Darth Vader, old people, and Luke, who is just learning.) Also, To the kid who has posted 20+ reviews here: Stop messing with this movie's review. You obviously didn't like the film, and I respect your opinion, but-get this-all you have to do is post ONE well-thought-out negative review for people to understand where you're coming from! Now, I know it's not easy for you, but I hear that if you close your eyes and think really, really hard, it IS actually possible to be mature.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AK9IWMR9WHZMT	john bayliss	First off know how this movie ends before I saw it is kinda disappointing. Besides that the movie was very powerful and compeling, but lacked that magic that Lucas wanted it to have. The battle scenes were incredible, but unfortunally the worlds they happened in were not.(Hoth's snow is snow, Tatoonie sand is sand, and Endor's trees are trees not blue screen effects)The movie starts with the emperor being rescued and the introduction of one of the more interesting characters General Grevious a droid with a cough and a limp. Afterwards Hayden Christianson does some more bad acting with poor dialoge and begins to turn to the dark side over family worries. For some reason Anakin is appointed to the Jedi council while still an apprentice. Obi-Wan has been appointed too with only a few years experience. I could go on, but I don't want to give to much away. I will say that while not stacking up to the original it's far better than most of the movies being put out by Hollywood.	4.0	Hmmmm... &lt;-SPOILERS->	2005-09-22	17	1	16
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2PBKFCD7YI23H	John B. Maggiore	"The Star Wars movie was great.  I feel so good about it, I don't know where to start.  It was a very serious, very adult movie.  It was modeled after a Greek or Shakespearian tragedy, not a Saturday morning serial or western.Here's what I liked:The saccharine lightness of the last three movies (including Return of the Jedi) now seems like a giant set up, to make Anakin Skywalker's fall more shocking and more emotional.  He does some very, very bad things that are far more disturbing than the larger-scale, but less personal evil of destroying a planet.The movie is very personal and very human, which is, I think, intentionally ironic because it so heavily relies on special effects.  Killing children and striking Padme (with the Force) were genuinely jarring.  I had an emotional reaction.I very much liked the parallel operations on Padme and Anakin, where they both sort of die and are both sort of reborn.  Padme is ""reborn"" in her children while Anakin was reborn as the Darth Vader we all know and love.  I liked how the Vader suit came off as a prison, the fitting of the mask was like the slamming of the cell door.  It reminded me of the end of the Godfather movies where there's a religious ceremony going on concurrent with a bunch of assassinations.I liked being kept off balance.  Significant characters were dying at all points in the movie.  Dooku got it earlier than I expected (and how he got it was the first of Anakin's jarring evil deeds).  Mace Windu was killed off in the middle, Padme died in the end.Up until this movie, The Empire Strikes Back was the only big-budget blockbuster aimed at a wide audience that ends with what amounts to a win for the bad guys.  This bad-guy win is more absolute, more total.  I like that because life doesn't always have a happy ending (if all big budget movies ended this way, I'd like the occasional happy ending).  The story of life is never as neatly complete as the end of Return of the Jedi.  Shakespeare wrote comedies, that ended well, for amusement, but there's a value in tragedy, too.  That's sorely, sorely lacking in pop culture, so I appreciate its use here.With the possible exception of Empire, Sith really isn't like any other movie.  One of the reasons I like Empire is that it isn't a re-hash of Star Wars.  Sith isn't a re-hash of anything at all (except, maybe Oedipus Rex or Julius Creaser).Despite all the heaviness of the movie, it never gets weighted down.  All this happens at a break-neck pace.  No drawn out, boring scenes in a swamp.Ewan and McDirmad (sp?) acted very well.Here's what I didn't like:I would have liked to have seen more of the masked Darth Vader.  He still has some transformation left.  He remains impulsive and emotional in this movie.  He's cold and calculating in Star Wars and Empire.  So to some extent he's still not the character we come to know later.I don't quite get the Emperor.  What's his end game?  What does he really want, and why?  What does he do for the next 20 years?  Is he happy? What's his vision for the Galaxy?  He is established as a liar, so all his talk of peace and order is disingenuous, but though he caused the wars up to his ascension as Emperor, is the implication that the next round of wars is caused by the ""good guys?""  There seems to be a suggestion that the Sith and the Jedi really aren't too different.  Yoda sends Obi-Wan off to kill his friend, which is the same thing Palpatine does with Anakin.  If that's deliberate, I think we would have had a better sense of there being two sides of the same coin if we had a better idea of what life under the Empire would ultimately be like, and how it would be worse than life under the Republic, which seems characterized by corrupt government, constant war, tolerance of slavery and gangsterism, and, for that matter, high taxes.Jar Jar didn't die!"	5.0	Great!	2006-01-12	4	1	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A385C064Y38OFK	"John Dagley ""RonHowardFan@hotmail.com"""	This was an incredible film. It's only a shame we have reached the end of the prequel trilogy. There is a perfect mix of emotion and action in every second of this outstanding work from George Lucas.I understand why these three episodes are very dear to George. It must be such a relief to finally have a life's work up on the screen for all to respect and admire. Stories rarely come better then this.I see `Revenge Of The Sith' becoming a legendary film like `Star Wars: Episode VI: Return Of The Jedi'. Finally this film lives up to the following `Star Wars' chapters. Episodes VII-IX, will never happen. I wouldn't really wish for it. I think this film has an even greater impact on the viewer then the previous `Star Wars' trilogy. This is a better trilogy. The second trilogy that everyone is most familiar with is great. It's just rightfully different. There is no real `Star Wars' winner to me.I WISH George Lucas had come to me to write the love scenes between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman. I feel I have a good grasp of romantic dialogue that really flows naturally from my fingers.One thing I will congratulate George on is his crisp clear writing style. It is right to the point and that is exactly what you need when film dialogue is concerned. There are a so many memorable lines in the entire set of films it's hard to pick a favorite.This is classic entertainment. I hope we see more from George Lucas behind the camera. The entire six films of Star Wars are special. I wouldn't be without them in my movie collection.George Lucas is still the master.	5.0	Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith	2005-05-30	9	3	6

I don't know why all this fighting keeps happening in this movie, (it is pretty annoying) as it takes away from the splendid acting and probing dialogues.A kid once told me that they are called ""light"" sabres because their weight is so light that only a Jedi can weild it. I did indeed slap him. Don't go getting too philosophical over pretty colored weapons that can cut through 10 foot solid space-steel walls. He then asked ""Why does the light from the light sabre stop and come to a point at the end? Light can't bend like that and just stop, it should go on traveling at the speed of light from there to the end of the universe, cutting through everything in its path."" Perhaps he was right, but I slapped him yet again. This time for questioning the authority of the lightsabre.

Sure Jar Jar and some other things were annoying.  But I was able to enjoy those films for their better parts.Episode three had a very tough task to accomplish - that of showing Annakin's turn.  And it failed at that task miserably.  The dialog is terrible, and the whole thing is just not believable at all.  This is the type of film that is so bad, people would like it.  But of course it takes itself way too seriously for that.This is a complete waste of time - not worth dvd, or the discount theatres.	1.0	A terrible end to a nice series	2005-10-02	38	10	28
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1PWKPO36BFZT4	John	"Episode III was a lot better than I expected. It starts out with some action and subtly delves into the heart of the movie, i.e. the internal intrigues and politics and the courtship of a confounded young adult Jedi by the dark side (Annakin Skywalker). Actually, he is played by both sides, but that is not an issue in this review. It ends with a climactic ending, if not a tragic one. However, the movie suffered from what it lacked the most -- good acting. Instead of a Jedi with dark ambitions mixed with noble ideals, we have a spoiled brat with temper tantrums (even as a dark Jedi he has his tantrums). There is more, but it is not the point of the review to delve into detail over that theme.It is sad to know this is the last Star Wars movie, for it left unanswered questions and a need to upgrade the story line before entering the original Star Wars movie. Here are some of them:* How Darth Vader acquired his fame as the sado-marochistic ruler he would be reknown as when he is introduced in the original Star Wars movie. Linked to this is his dark training by Darth Sidious and the mastering of dark powers.* How does Obi Wan develop the ability to talk with the spirit world. This ability to see the dead and communicate with them is what will earn him the reputation as ""that crazy old man in the desert"" as Luke's foster dad would refer to him. What insights would Obi wan's mentor reveal to ease his tormented mind (after all he ""killed"" his best friend and saw him burn alive, while trying to make some sense to Quin Nog's prediction that Annakin was the Chosen One despite having gone to the other side).* How does the rebellion begin? The original begins with a rebellion, and there is definitely a 20-25 year gap between Episode III and the original. It doesn't happen overnight. Dictatorships don't go down easily internally in short periods of time. Linked to this is Princess Lea who grows up during this time as an adolescent, assuming finally in the original the leadership of the rebellion.* How Darth Vader converts the clones into gestapo-type troopers (later to be called stormtroopers)and hunts and cracks down all dissent to his beloved Master, Emperor Palpatine. Linked to this is his personal hunt for Obi wan, his hatred and revenge urging him on. They must face each other a couple of times, for I do not think Obi wan never sees Darth Vader until he meets him in the Death Star (nor was it implied in that scene of the original movie that that was their first meeting. Actually, it was the one, and the last, of many duels).* How does Obi Wan find out Annakin (Darth Vader) survived what appeared to him as a gruesome death. What secret role does he play in fostering the resistance to the dictatorship?Too bad this was the last. One mor movie filling in these theme holes would make the transition into the original movie a whole lot better and niftier.Episode III is a good movie, best of the prequels, and holds its own despite the deficient acting. A good job by Mr. Lucas."	4.0	Decent Movie but left unanswered questions	2005-06-02	5	2	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AKT8TGIT6VVZ5	John Kwok	"""Star Wars - Episode III, Revenge of the Sith"", is not only by far the best of the prequel trilogy of ""Star Wars"" films, I believe that it may in fact be better than ""Star Wars - Episode VI, Return of the Jedi"". In fact, I would rate this behind ""Star Wars, Episode IV, A New Hope"" as the third best of the six ""Star Wars"" films (Of course the best is ""Star Wars - Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back"" which is light years ahead of the others with regards to both excellent acting and especially, a sterling script penned by Lawrence Kasdan and the late Leigh Brackett, a noted science fiction writer.). Indeed, of the three prequel ""Star Wars"" films, this is the one which deserves to be called ""Star Wars"", since it chronicles the end of the ""Clone Wars"" and the unexpected ascent to power of the malevolent Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) and his young Sith apprentice Darth Vader (Hayden Christensen with an uncredited voiceover by none other than James Earl Jones at the very end of the film).""Star Wars - Episode III, Revenge of the Sith"" starts off with a bang and more than a bit of an adrenaline rush with our young heroes Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Chistensen) flying Jedi fighters past duelling starships in an epic space battle high above the surface of Coruscant, the Republic's capital planet. They're on a desperate search and rescue mission, hoping to free Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from his captors; the cyborg droid General Grevious and Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), the Sith Lord commanding the Separatist forces. Aboard General Grevious' flagship, the two Jedi knights battle an entire regiment - or so it seems - of enemy droid soldiers before a final light saber duel with Count Dooku. Skywalker wins the duel, frees the Chancellor, and embarks on his first steps towards the Dark Side, thinking that he is acting only in the best interests of the Republic and its Senate. Soon he'll make two unexpected discoveries; Padme's (Natalie Portman) pregnancy, and the Chancellor's secret identity as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, which will have tragic consequences for himself and the entire Jedi Order, culminating in an epic light saber duel between himself and his erstwhile friend Obi-Wan Kenobi.Young Anakin Skywalker must wrestle with his emotions as he dreams disturbing premonitions of Padme's death, and contends with conflicting political demands from both the Jedi Council and his new friend Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. In a surprising move, Palpatine appoints Anakin as his personal representative on the Jedi Council; it is one which is only grudgingly accepted by the Council, with Mace Windu telling Skywalker that he can only have the seat, not the honor that would normally come with it as a Jedi Master; an honor bestowed already on his old friend General Obi-Wan Kenobi. Slowly Skywalker realizes that his old, trusted friend, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, is not all that he appears to be, but indeed, that he is too the surviving Sith Lord Darth Sidious. No longer trusted by his fellow Jedi - who lead raids on Separatist forces throughout the galaxy (There's a notable sequence of Yoda leading the Wookies against Separatist forces on the Wookie homeworld.) without keeping Skywalker informed - young Anakin Skywalker makes a Faustian bargain with Palpatine/Sidious, hoping that his new knowledge of the Dark Side of the Force will save Padme, her unborn child, and the Republic's democratic government. However, Skywalker's decision to become Palpatine's new Sith apprentice, Darth Vader, will result in the Republic's downfall, replaced by a despotic Galactic Empire ruled by Palpatine, and the virtual extinction of the Jedi Order. Ultimately it will also lead to Padme's death in childbirth; the infant Luke and Leia are hidden secretly on Tatooine and Alderaan (The film ends with a memorable sunset on Tatooine as the young Uncle Lars and Aunt Beru gaze lovingly at their adopted son Luke.).The best acting in the film comes from much of the supporting cast, with highest honors going to Samuel L. Jackson (Mace Windu), Jimmy Smits (Senator Bail Organa), and the voice of Frank Oz as of course Yoda. I must also praise Ewan McGregor for giving his finest portrayal yet of Obi-Wan Kenobi, offering us much more than a tantalizing glimpse of the character as portrayed by the late Sir Alec Guinness in the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy. Ian McDiarmid's performance is also just as splendid as the villainous Palpatine and Darth Sidious. There are epic light saber duels between Mace Windu and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and between Palpatine and Yoda that are far better than any I have seen in the original trilogy itself. The same holds true for the special effects, which are without question, the best in the series. John Williams composed over an hour of original music for the film score, combining elements from all six movies in the themes, with brilliant playing by the London Symphony Orchestra. My only disappointments are the rather unconvincing love scenes between Anakin and Padme and the rationale for Anakin's rapid descent into the Dark Side of the Force. But despite these minor caveats, I wouldn't hesitate seeing this ""Star Wars"" film more than once. May the Force be with us this summer!"	5.0	"One of the three best ""Star Wars"" films"	2005-05-20	7	5	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2TDK8D4HEMUYW	"John ""MovieAddict"""	"Almost thirty years in the making, George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" space opera has finally reached its conclusion (or has it?) and we are now finally able to judge the series as a whole.The good news is that ""Revenge of the Sith"" is not only the best of the prequels, but the darkest installment since ""The Empire Strikes Back."" The bad news is that it isn't half as good as ""Empire"" and not even as entertaining as ""Return of the Jedi."" The good news is that Jar-Jar Binks is only in one scene and doesn't say a single word. The bad news is that cartoon-ish CGI action sequences take his place and add to Lucas' increasingly childish ambitions.There's more good news and bad news. The fan-reviled Hayden Christensen, as Anakin Skywalker, has less dialogue than he did in ""Attack of the Clones."" Also, less time is spent on the love story between he and Padme (Natalie Portman). Unfortunately, when he does speak, or when they are required to be intimate, the movie stumbles - Christensen delivers every line in the same monotonous boredom that his devolution into the dark side doesn't seem all that big a deal - except for dark circles under his eyes and a jaundiced complexion, he appears identical to his earlier self. Another flaw in Lucas' story is that Anakin's decision to become a Sith Lord is too sudden; although there is ample emotional conflict in Anakin's past and present leading up to this, Lucas spends such little time detailing these feelings that Anakin really doesn't carry much weight as a character; when he turns, we don't feel anything significant is happening.The fault really lies within the material itself. Lucas should have employed a talented co-writer to polish up the script, as he did for the original trilogy. Not to sound unfair, but Lucas is simply no Mamet or Tarantino. His exchanges are clumsy, awkward and occasionally nonsensical. Lucas adds a mythic vibe to his jargon that is unnecessary; for example, his referral to children as ""younglings,"" or the whole ""Thy will shall be done Master"" attitude. I know it's supposed to take place ""a long time ago,"" but that doesn't mean it has to sound quite as fake as it does. (The actors' sordid delivery doesn't help much, either.) In terms of new characters, the one everybody's been talking about is General Grievous, a half-alien/half-mechanical hybrid with special abilities. Disappointingly, however, Grievous is a huge letdown. As a villain, the robotic General is hardly menacing; it's hard to fear a character that incessantly coughs, wheezes and cowardly runs away every time a conflict occurs. Not only is Grievous a wimp, but also when he finally reveals his four lightsaber-wielding robotic limbs, the pay-off is anti-climactic - in less than a minute he's handless. I am told he was much scarier in the animated ""Clone War"" films; let's hope so.It seems as if I'm complaining a lot, huh? Not really. These are just some of the things I disliked about ""Sith."" On the plus side, the last hour of ""RotS"" turns into a brooding, menacing feature; like ""The Return of the King,"" the entire layering of the film itself becomes clouded, caustic and caliginous - somber shades oozing through every frame.The final battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin was far more exciting and entertaining than I thought it would be - coming from someone who feels the novelty of the lightsaber battles faded away with the quality of the predecessors. Instead, I found Obi-Wan and Anakin's fierce showdown is emotional and tragic - it is also centerpiece to the best moments of acting in the entire new trilogy (Obi-Wan shouting at Anakin about how he failed him is pessimistic, depressing and real -- arguably the most genuine sample of dialogue from any other prequel.) The reappearance of Darth Vader could probably have been presented slightly more dramatically than it is here (inter-cut with birth/funeral sequences), and Lucas' modifications to the famous suit - namely the thinner face area, more rounded helmet and distinctly fake-looking mid-section - make it look like a Halloween costume. But then the heavy breathing is heard and we all know, Darth Vader is back! Yoda gets some good scenes here and there's a cameo from an old friend halfway through the movie. The parts involving Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) are very entertaining and his battle with Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) is exciting. There are some really dark moments (such as Darth Vader's unexpected killing spree), even if they don't always feel totally genuine.Overall, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is not a flawless film and it does not solve all of the problems inherent in the other prequels. But (and this is a big ""but"") Lucas DOES fix up some stuff - as I mentioned above, Jar-Jar is pretty much gone, the lightsaber battles are more exciting, and most importantly the last hour picks up such a relentless, ferocious pace that it almost entirely redeems the earlier misfires. On top of that, it's stuffed with nostalgic references to the original trilogy that will surely whet every fan's lustful appetite.So while I can't necessarily say ""Revenge of the Sith"" is bereft of the criticisms of the other prequels, it's a generally solid closure to the trilogy and definitely the best of the three ""Star Wars"" prequels. I was willing to ignore many of its flaws because I was having such a fun time - and to be honest I think that's partly the case with every film in the entire ""Star Wars"" saga. The difference here, as compared to ""Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones,"" is that ""Revenge of the Sith"" is actually an entertaining movie - and as a result you'll probably be willing to enjoy it as such and disregard the more frustrating moments."	4.0	Not totally flawless but certainly the best of the prequels	2005-05-21	4	3	1

I guess when twinkie-eating adolescents can't get a date, they turn to the Dark Side....I've never been an hysterical Star Wars fan, but I rather enjoyed the last two films, more than the critics and the hardcore fans, apparently.  And I enjoyed this one--enjoyed the hell out of it.It wasn't nearly as ""dark"" as I was led to expect with all of Lucas' portentous talk leading up to its release, but there was plenty of killing, and I'm guessing that what got it its PG-13 rating was the combination of unbloody dismemberments and the murder of children (which happens offscreen).Anakin's migration to the dark side seemed to happen awfully quickly...or perhaps not quickly so much as without the sort of motivation that I would have found more convincing than what was actually offered.  Or maybe it was Christenson who was unconvincing--and whether it was Christennson's fault or the director's, I don't know.  Still, his turning involved a nice, if tragic, piece of irony.There is mercifully little of the goofball element in this movie--nary a shot of Jar Jar, or the annoying antics of C3PO.  R2D2 provides a laugh or two, but there isn't that excessive cuteness that we had to sit through in earlier films.Not everything in the movie made sense...You have to wonder why it is so easy for Kenobi and Skywalker to get to the Chancellor, who is being held hostage in the opening sequence.  Is this part of his scheme to seduce Skywalker?  If so, there is nothing to suggest that other than the implausibility of the action.McDiarmid does a great job with Palpatine, particularly when his character emerges from his statesman-like persona to become the writhing, hissing & spitting creep that he is.  We see him manipulating Anakin, but it seems to easy, and Anakin too ready to fall for it.I would have liked to see this film go on longer than it did.  It was never boring, and it would have been interesting to watch Darth settle into his new role as Uber-Baddie of the Universe.Overall, a very enjoyable movie experience, one worth waiting in line for.  Now I wonder if Fox will let the franchise really end, or find a way to resurrect it with more sequels."	4.0	Back In Black	2005-05-19	6	5	1

After many great things are over you are left with an empty feeling, a feeling that you want more, such was the feeling that came over me after I had witnessed the 3 orginal Star Wars Episodes.  I walked away from Sith with a feeling that a part of me had been completed.Sith takes place immediately after the cartoon version of ""The Clone Wars"".  Coruscant is under attack from Federation ships and a mission has befallen our Jedi heroes Anakin and Obi-Wan, to board Gen. Grievous' ship and rescue the Chancellor.  Soon after and even during his battle with Count Dooku the downward spiral of Anakin begins.  ""I shouldn't have done that"" says Anakin to Chancellor Palpatine after his battle with Dooku.  During his change to the dark side you can't help but feel sorry for one of the most evil charachters of all time.  A feeling comes over you that makes you want to stand up and scream ""Anakin stop it, its a lie""  but the path of young Anakin has already been decided.  The reason he does it is his own undoing.  He has a vision and is promised he can keep it from happening by the Emperor Palpatine, later we find this to be untrue as his venture to the darkside is the reason of this dream.  This vision is similar to MacBeths vision that also led to his downfall.This movie I believe is great, Hayden Christansen is still the emotionless actor that we saw in Attack of the Clones.  But this is my only complaint, the dialogue I believed was fine, many people have complained that Lucas' dialogue is weak, especially during the love scenes, well its a good thing this movie is not a romance, anyone that complains about this needs to realize that they are not watching this movie for its romantic plots.  This movie is filled with action from start to finish, the duel between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader is amazing, and the minute of screen time that the mechanical Darth Vader has is unbelievable.  There is also a brief scene with Moff Tarkin, who amazingly looks like his original in Star Wars.Be prepared for the darkest movie you will ever see. Everyone knows what happens, they just dont know what it looks like, a sad feeling came over me during this part of the movie.  Anakin seals his fate to the dark side when he leads thousands of Imperial troops into the Jedi Academy.  During his attack Anakin comes across some ""younglings"" and you cant help but think, No Anakin, then you see the lightsaber emerge and a fade to black.  Many questions of the Star Wars universe is answered in this movie (one of the most unexpected was why Emperor Palpatinelooks the way he does), and I guarantee that 98% of the viewers will love this movie, Sith easily surpasses the other 2 prequels (there is no Jar-Jar for all you gungan haters) and deserves its place with the orignial trilogy."	5.0	Revenge of the Sith aka  The tragedy of Anakin Skywalker	2005-05-19	8	5	3

This is a preview obviously because the actual movie does not hit theaters until May 19, 2005. Some people say it will suck, some people will say it'll be the best one yet, or just as good as the originals. I can't see why everyone hates the prequels, its not like George Lucas is re-doing the whole original trilogy with a new cast and everything, they need to start the story some place. In my opinion, ROTS will be as good if not better than the originals, because of the whole dark and deadly storyline to it. I have to say I was a fan of TPM and AOTC, but I'm not one of those people who know how many friggin stormtroopers Han Solo shot in the original 3.As most of you know, ROTS is the 3rd prequel and HOPEFULLY the last movie in the saga. The story finally comes to an end (and beginning) in the SW saga, when Anakin Skywalker takes his final steps over to the dark side alongside Emperor Palpatine (aka Darth Sidious). The jedi come to an end and Chewie and the Wookies will fight in an all out battle between good and evil, but we all know evil conquers all in the end of this trilogy. Luke and Leia are born, and so on. WHO CARES, ITS FRIGGIN STAR WARS!!!And I come to the conclusion that Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith will be amazing.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A22BPC7LRSGSYQ	Joker	"""Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?""Since my favorite character in the entire six-movie Star Wars saga is Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious or ""Emperor Palpatine"", I was excited when Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith was about to be released in May 2005.  I was not disappointed in the least bit.  The movie is what a Star Wars movie should be.  Everything in this movie was outstanding - the special effects, the atmosphere, the story, and the acting.I thought when The Phantom Menace came out that the scenes on Coruscant, with the flying vehicles, the various sky and weather conditions, etc. couldn't be topped.  Then they were topped by a mile in Episode II - Attack Of The Clones (2002).  Then Episode III topped them all.  I've always liked the planet of Coruscant.  I think it's one of the strong aspects of the prequels.  George Lucas couldn't show Coruscant in episodes IV, V, and VI at the time they were originally released in the theater because it was not possible to create such a planet without high quality computer generated images, something that was unavailable back then.  He kind of made up for it in a small way by inserting additional scenes in the 2004 enhanced edition DVDs of episodes IV, V, and VI that showed Coruscant and even Cloud City and Naboo, all very briefly.The funniest part of the movie is when Yoda uses the force to knock out the Imperial guards.I thought the whole scene with General Grievous went on too long and I also felt it was borderline unnecessary.  He's a cool character, though.  I like his cough and how he's practically 90% machine.  It's funny how Kenobi kills him - with a blaster of all things, and with EASE.  Grievous is so vulnerable and easily killed because his organs are not adequately protected.Hayden Christensen's acting was WAY better in this movie than it was in Attack Of The Clones.  In Clones, he was wooden.  In Sith, he's believable and a lot more natural.  Ewan McGregor once again played the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi very well.  His portrayal of the character was already leaning toward the smooth transition to Alec Guinness's character of Ben Kenobi in Episode IV - A New Hope.I thought the Wookie planet Kashyyyk was cool and I liked seeing Chewbacca (once again played by Peter Mayhew) in the movie.  The battle scenes on that planet were really good.My favorite scene in the whole movie is when Mace Windu and three other Jedi Knights visit the Chancellor and try to arrest him.  Then all hell breaks loose and the Chancellor kills three Jedi Knights in eight seconds, then battles Windu fiercely.  This scene where three Jedi Knights are killed in eight seconds is downright unbelievable.  They're so easily killed and almost seem to let the Chancellor kill them with ease, though I know this was not the intention here.  It was just as plain as needing to kill off three Jedi Knights quickly so the focus would be on Windu and the Chancellor fighting to the finish.  But still......it's unbelievable that three Jedis would be so lacking in the skills department.  The scene where the Chancellor pretends he's out of electricity then zaps Windu after his hand is cut off by Anakin, is wicked, evil, and funny.  It's a classic.  Another thing that's unbelievable to me is how a 60-year-old Chancellor (and earlier in the movie, a 60-ish Count Dooku) can do backflips and move very quickly, yet a 60-ish Ben Kenobi in A New Hope isn't doing backflips and seems incapable of doing it and is fighting like a 60-ish guy would.  I know that CGI technology is what enables the backflips to be possible in the prequels, but still...one 60-year-old's fighting skills (Ben Kenobi's) are believable, while the others' are not.  Dooku, Palpatine, and Ben Kenobi all know the Force and are around the same age, yet Dooku and Palpatine's skills seem more advanced.  I don't know.The light sabre fight between the Emperor and Yoda was great.  A little over-the-top, but great.  The light sabre fight between Kenobi and Skywalker (or rather Darth Vader) is epic, visually stunning, highly intense, and over-the-top in a lot of places.  This is supposed to be THE battle of the whole Star Wars saga, and it delivers.The scenes after the epic light sabre fight between Kenobi and Vader are some of my favorite scenes in the whole movie.  I also think Alderaan was brilliantly done.  At the end of the movie, Jar Jar Binks is on the screen for a few seconds during the funeral scene.  When I saw the movie in the theater, I remember thinking, ""Oh no, please no"".  A few seconds later I said, ""Whew!!!  That was close!!!""This movie is presented in widescreen.My personal rankings of the Star Wars movies are in the following order, from favorite to least favorite:1. The Empire Strikes Back2. A New Hope3. Revenge Of The Sith4. Attack Of The Clones5. Return Of The Jedi6. The Phantom MenaceThe musical score by John Williams is exceptional and might be my favorite out of all six movies.  It certainly is in my top three.This is a two-DVD set.  I especially like the audio commentary by the makers of the movie.  The second DVD has a lot of cool features, including how the movie was made.  It's very interesting to watch.If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend it.  If you have seen it but don't have the DVD, then I highly recommend this two-DVD set."	5.0	"""In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor""."	2010-08-30	3	2	1

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3HBNOC6ANFNSK	Jonathan C. Pike	"Yes, I was entertained by Revenge of the Sith.  It has pretty cool fight scenes, great special effects, and is fairly interesting if you can gloss over some plot problems.  And yes it was much better than the first two prequels.But that being said, the movie had some SERIOUS flaws.- Hayden Christenson's acting:  Wow is all I can say.  I had this fantasy that Hayden would be given a crash course in acting between movies two and three.  I was disabused of that notion in a violent manner.  If possible, I think his acting was worse in this one.  Man, he's terrible.  I would even go so far as to say he approaches the level of Paul Walker in bad acting.  But Paul Walker is terrible in a lovable sort of way.  Christenson is terrible in a wanna punch him in the face sort of way.  He shows the full range of acting spectrum from somewhat pouty and annoyed at his lover to very pouty and annoyed at his mentors.  I couldn't wait for him to burn alive.- Conversion to the dark side:  Did anyone else think Annakin went over way to easily?  It's like he decided to abandon all his teaching and friends in about 2 minutes.  ""Oh what's that, Palpatine?  You, an evil Sith Lord, are offering me some sort of dubious solution to Padme's impeding death, which I know is going to happen since I saw it in a dream, and dreams always come true?  Well hell, sign me up! Sounds like a deal!""  Really thought this should've been sort of a gradual thing, but I guess: who needs character believability?-  Anakin tries to kill Padme?  What the hell?  And it's not because he is ""turning to the dark side"" and doesn't love her.  His first question as Darth is about her.- The high ground:  Hmmm... so Obi Wan is able to defeat Anakin, supposedly the strongest Jedi ever (AKA the Chosen One.  And what the hell ever became of that whole prophecy business anyways?) simply because he has ""the high ground"".  Well damn, I guess fighting ability and power count for nothing if your opponent is on ground 2 feet higher up than you.  Might as well lay down your lightsaber, drop your drawers, and get ready for a whoopin.- Hayden Christensen's acting: He's like a block of wood with... wait did I do this one already?Well I guess that's about all I can stomach right now.  So entertaining?  Yes.  But I would hesitate to call it a good movie."	3.0	Pretty good movie, but some REALLY stupid parts	2005-12-02	25	20	5

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3BHVSEPMJJDZI	Jonathan	"No matter how good this movie is, it will never be as good as any of the first trilogy (EPs IV, V, & VI).  At that point, Lucas was making the movies to fullfill his dream.  Now, he continues to do that, but instead of his dream being to make movies that will last forever, it is a dream of even more ways to make money.  Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to realize that the best way to do this is to make a movie that actually is GOOD.  Episode I was horrible, and taken in combination with all the other star wars material that existed at its creation, could be a completely different galaxy.  If pod racing was so big, so dangerous, and so exciting, how did the entire galaxy manage to forget about its existence over the passage of a few years?  Also, apparently Chewbacca is in this third movie, which is fine because his lifetime would be long enough, but if he was truly in it, you would think that he might have mentioned things that had happened back then before.  It's kind of stupid, really.  If I didn't love star wars, I would have given this a 1...  I love star wars, and respect Lucas for his original vision, but I hate the way he ahs completely changed the way the story has grown.  It would have been a lot better to make movie versions of the Zahn trilogy which comes AFTER IV, V, and VI then to do this.  Those books are such amazing works, that they would have been a great way for Lucas to earn more income if he really cared about the Star Wars universe.  And now, with his idea to redo all the movies into 3-d, he is just pro-longing his fame, and making more of the true fans angrier with him.**UPDATE AUGUST 2005**I have to say that I don't completely agree with my previous assessment of the movie, I went and saw it opening weekend with one of my friends, and it was quite breath-taking.  I'll definitely buy the dvd when it comes out.  With that said, I still feel that George Lucas has lost some of his gifts...  The script of the movie, as everyone has said, is pretty horrible.  Also, there were a couple things I couldn't stand about it, including ""younglings""  WHAT ON EARTH WERE THEY THINKING?  Still, overall a great movie, and much better than I had expected."	2.0	How much money can I make?	2005-04-04	17	6	11
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A391917OBT3KWR	Jonathan Jett-Parmer	Lucas' work on this film represents the best of the last set of Star Wars movies.  The special additions (like the LEGO trailers) are great.  I found the overall movie very dark and not recommended for young children.  Having these movies at hand is a great starting point for discussions of good and evil and its respective origin.  I find this film to be far more complex than the other five movies.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AUS2EQT4NU3BF	"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner"""	"It is difficult for me to evaluate the Star Wars movies individually because each has been intended to be viewed as one whole saga. But for the record, STAR WARS:  EPISODE III--REVENGE OF THE SITH is a definite step-up from its flawed yet serviceable predecessors, THE PHANTOM MENACE and ATTACK OF THE CLONES, respectively. Whereas the aforementioned prequels took their time to set up exposition, this one unfolds at such a fierce, kinetic pace that you'll be hanging on for dear life.The extended action sequence which opens the movie, where Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) rescue Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) hearkens back to the visceral excitement and spectacle of the very first shot from the original STAR WARS (or as we should be calling it by now, EPISODE IV:  A NEW HOPE) and here we get to see (gasp!) electrifying chemistry between MacGregor and Christensen as well as stunts (plus humor provided by R2-D2!). This also sets up the introduction of a new villain, a hulking CGI-crafted droid called General Grievous; admittingly, his malevolent demeanor, thick accent and constant coughing does come across as one-dimensional, but his final showdown with Obi-Wan (where he arms four lightsabers!) is something to see.Things get a little slower around the second quarter of the movie where we get treated(?) to a few love scenes between Anakin and Padme. The overabundance of these scenes were my biggest issue with ATTACK OF THE CLONES (and in REVENGE OF THE SITH, they still come across as a little shaky at times, with a few awkward lines I counted), fortunately in this chapter there aren't as many, and the overall chemistry between Christensen and Portman is greatly improved into something respectable if not outstanding. Actually, the best moment between them (SPOILER ALERT!) occurs before the fateful showdown with Obi-Wan Kenobi on Mustafar. I was surprised at how emotional and heartbreaking this exchange was.Speaking of Christensen, I didn't have much of a problem with him in ATTACK OF THE CLONES (even though his scenes with Padme were hardly something to call praiseworthy), but here he really seems to have grown into the role. His descent into evil is surprisingly well acted and comes off best during the climactic moments. MacGregor, too, is excellent. He was a tad wooden in EPISODES I and II, but in this chapter he really sinks into the character and comes close to matching Alec Guiness's legendary performance as Obi-Wan. The same is true for Samuel Jackson as Mace Windu. Whereas he was pretty stiff in the earlier chapters, his confrontation with Palpatine carries a grand dramatic weight and he actually had me rooting for him. Yoda is once again a pleasure to watch whenever we see him onscreen; he is upstaged only by Ian McDiarmid, who delivered a deliciously raspy evil to the Emperor in RETURN OF THE JEDI and played Palpatine for the prequels.  McDiarmid speaks his lines with intonations so chilly that he tears into every sequence involving him.  REVENGE OF THE SITH is, without a doubt, his movie.It is the final half of the movie, though, that really gives this episode a lot of dramatic punch--grittier than even THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and tragic in almost every way, this is George Lucas at his darkest and best.  Regardless of what anyone says about his directing and/or scripting abilities, his gift as a storyteller shines through this movie and kept me engrossed in every minute of it.It's not perfect, mind you. The dialogue is clunky at times and there are at least a few moments that come across as laughable and/or didn't live up to the rest of the movie (in particular, Darth Vader screaming ""NOOOO!"" toward the end sounded more strained than believable--this has actually grown on me after viewing the movie again recently).However, as probably has been said countless times, these ""weaknesses"" are par for the course with the STAR WARS movies (yes, even the original trilogy)... and the strengths REVENGE OF THE SITH provides outweighs its shortcomings, making it probably the best of the STAR WARS prequels, and a very fitting match for the original trilogy we all know and love. It was quite a long wait, but in the end, it was worth it. As the tagline proudly states, the saga is complete at last.And to give further credit where credit is due, the DVD release is once again outstanding.  The video transfer is reference-quality, showcasing the spectacular visuals from the first frame to the last, and the audio soundtrack is, as Darth Vader would claim, ""most impressive.""  I haven't delved into the extras yet, but given the past track record of Lucas's previous DVD releases, I have little reason to doubt that they'll be worthwhile.The STAR WARS prequels have taken hits from detractors over the years (sometimes unfairly, too); whether REVENGE OF THE SITH is strong enough to provide a big pay-off for the sometimes sluggish pace we got in the previous entries depends on the viewer.  As a longtime STAR WARS fan who happens to be fond of both the original and the prequel trilogy in spite of their faults, though, I have to tip my hat to Lucas for finishing his saga and, to a lesser extent, doing it his way.  In favor of REVENGE OF THE SITH, it does maintain many of the faults of its predecessors, but the visceral excitement of the first quarter and the dramatically dark second half make it a very worthy entry in the franchise.  If this is the last we will see of the STAR WARS movies, then it is a breath of fresh air that Lucas decided to close his saga on a very high note."	5.0	The prequel trilogy --and the saga-- finally comes full circle in this satisfyingly dramatic entry.	2005-11-02	10	8	2

The plot while simple at times and can be followed for the most part drags on and on.What is done well is watching Anikin Skywalker take the downward,spiraling path to the dark side,where he is ultimately lost and consumed by his own anger,jealousy,selfishness and ego.He didn't have the tantrums he had in the second film,but there were a couple times that made me cringe and things would have been better left unsaid.If you are a die hard Star Wars fan,this isn't a bad film to watch,but I would never purchase it myself.The original three films are the best,and well worth owning,I wouldn't own the three prequals if someone was giving it away.I may appear to be judging this film harshly,but its all there to be seen. The plot and story will be for the most part...too complicated for kids to follow,they will only be interested in the spaceships,aliens and battle scenes.This is a mediocre script and screenplay at best with just a HUGE FX budget to distract you from how badly the story/script is written.I remain unbiased and review all films the same way,if its good,its good,if its Hollywood garbage...I define it as such and Revenge of the Sith just barely passes with two stars.There are other,better Sci-Fi and Fantasy films out there,this just isn't one of them."	2.0	"Revenge of the Sith ends with a ""pop""instead of a BANG"	2006-06-20	6	1	5
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1CRBA8BW6Z3YS	Jonothan Starsmore	Episode three is finally here and the ending was well done.  Sure there are numerous ways Lucas could have gone, but he chose this way.  Other story lines continue in the books which are also well written.For close observers, there are a couple discrepancies between the first and second trilogies.  For example in Empire, Obi Wan had to be reminded about Leia's existence when he was there when the twins were born.  No big deal.  E3 was definitely better than 1 and 2 but still don't stand up to the original trilogy.The one thing that was annoying was skinny Christensen in the Vader suit at the end.	4.0	Fitting end	2006-03-03	4	0	4

The fall of the republic and the rise of empire is both complex and amazingly simple.The first 3 movies (eps 4-6) were amazing. But, part of their strength is the 'surprise' factor. Darth Vader being Luke's father, the absolution of Darth, the fall of empire... All happening for the first time and shocking us.With this movie, we basically know what's happening and going to happen. Lucas does an amazing job walking us through the timeline, giving us the reasons, backup information, and filling in all the blanks from 25+ years of love for the series. A tremendous achievement to have such a dark movie, end on a down note, but still keep hope alive, keep it for the children, and make it interesting.Most importantly, it has great replayability!  You can watch it over and over and still feel the pangs of sorrow as Anankin struggles with his choices - each one logical and based on Love as he decends.	4.0	The best of the 6?	2006-12-29	3	1	2

This isn't a bad film - well the second half isn't anyway - it's actually quite entertaining, and towards the end, the immense nostalgia takes over. Unfortunately, among the original trilogy, this movie still remains average. To be frank, the acting, while ever so slightly improved, still sucks. The dialogue and scripting is still bad, and of course, the acting is as stilted as ever. I'm one of the few who believe Episode 1 was the best installment, which of course isn't saying much; however, at least that movie had some decent acting and wasn't completely dumbed down by all the special effects. Episode 2 felt like a cartoon. Episode 3 is no different, minus the only redeeming factor which is the ending -- that last bit of nostalgia that George felt curtious enough to throw in. Unfortunately, an entire prequel trilogy -- a followup to some of the best movies ever made -- has been wasted.

You know that list of the order in which they liked the films most that all Star Wars fandom worldwide sent to one another all over the world the morning after they saw it, overloading every business email server everywhere? You know, like the one you sent your friends this morning...?  Like THIS ONE!!!  Here's mine, without any of the nitpicking-ness, because I've decided that SITH beautifully ties everything up so much that it made every one of the other films even more important.  Even Phantom Menace, which - and I know this is supposed to be sacreligious or something - I still fail to hate. (Okay, so I get nitpicky on the Ewoks, but they still deserve it).V, III, IV, II, VI, IV - Everything was spot-on in this film, it has no marks against it, in either the old version or the Special Edition version.  An unsurpassed work of art.  I count the soundtrack as one of my inspirations for getting into music back in - what was it - '82? '83? The entire cloud city sequence from beginning to end is PERFECT FILM.III - Just freakin' amazing - a dark magnum opus leaving all expectations behind in the dust, and reminding us why we got into all this to begin with.  I can't think of a single un-tied-up loose end.  Fan-FREAKING-tastic.IV - The original will always be the best interaction between the main good guys; dialogue that will be quoted for all time on planet earth until the end of days. History is still marked in my mind in terms of before this film came out, and after this film came out and conquered the world.  And would someone please get this walking carpet out of my way? No reward is worth this!II - Sorry, nit-picky fanboys... it's a fantastic movie no matter what anyone says, and I'm still stunned at all the hate and lambasting this great film gets. I've said it before and I'll say it again... no matter what Lucas ever would have done, no part I and II would have ever satisfied classic Star Wars' fandom. He gives them this big movie packed with stuff they always wanted to see, like a battlefield of fighting Jedi (with Sam Jackson heading them up, no less!!!) and they complain.  I mean, they complain like nothing I've ever seen. Yoda battling a Sith played by the guy that played Dracula in the classic Hammer horror films!!! The birth of the Stormtroopers! The start of the Clone Wars that Sir Alec foreshadowed! That awesome Blade Runner-meets-the-Jetsons chase through the streets of Coruscant!VI - Shreds of amazing film, some of the most groundbreaking space battles in movie history - a heart-rending perfect follow-up to the blue-blue-blue, heart-wrenching Empire (V) sword battle, interlaced with sequences of walking teddy bears that had no moving facial features. (Worse than ""yippee"" any day, in my estimation). Most notable for the series-ending sequence in the Emperor's throne room where L & D hashed it all out once and for all, and for Leia's infamous chain male bikini which men love to love and women love to hate. We won't even go into the now-removed ""Yubb-Yubb"" song. Jeez!!  Ewoks = POODOO!!! The Rest = EXCELLENCE.I - People have a right as an American to not like JarJar (but those in other countries can just shut up; France still watches Jerry Lewis), but taken as a complete movie it's very watchable, has cool fight sequences, and has two of the greatest displays of Jedi power in the entire series. Liam Neeson as a Jedi Master!!! COME ON!!! He's so cool in that movie I get ice cubes on my eyeballs just watching!! And McGregor is a 4-star young-Alec-Guiness!!! And the planet Naboo is absolutely beautifully rendered!  It only goes last because of ""yippee"" and because the others are just better.And I'm happy for George that he can finally move on; and I admire the vigour and staying-power and chutzpah he has displayed in holding up that middle digit to the nit-pickers all these years. It's his, not yours; like it or don't. He doesn't care."	4.0	Second Only To One	2005-06-02	7	4	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A22Z22U91OK40X	"Joshua Chrisopher Stephen Rauch ""JC"""	":-)I have read the reviews on line here at Amazon.com about the trailer for ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,"" some I agree with, others I don't. I saw this trailer several times as TiVo grabbed it and I won't let it go. The one unfortunate thing is that Lucas is directing again and he is no director, a great storyteller, creating great characters and a great adventure to watch those characters grow within the film, but he is no director. As I have viewed many of the movies Lucas has directed, from ""THX 1138,"" ""American Graffiti,"" ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,"" and ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,"" and it became apparent to me that Lucas is no director as his camera angles are trivial and not very imaginative - much different from the collaboration between he and Steven Spielberg in the ""Indiana Jones"" movies. That collaboration really works and I bet had Lucas asked Spielberg to direct his saga he would have agreed - after all Spielberg is directing ""Indiana Jones 4"" as he did all the pervious ""Indiana Jones"" movies. Still I suspect this will be a magnificent movie.I have read all the speculations but I choose to go from only that which I have seen on the trailer. In the preview we see Palpatine tempting Anakin with greater power, Anakin getting appointed to the Jedi Council but withholding the rank of Master leading Anakin to believe he is not trusted, Palpatine getting into a lightsaber duel with many of the Jedi Masters, we see Bail Organa actually get into the fighting, we get to see Chewbacca once again, we see Palpatine declare all Jedi enemies of the Republic likely after declaring himself Emperor, we see Anakin killing members of the Trade Federation, the long awaited lightsaber dual between Anakin & Obi-Wan, even the Emperor versus Yoda in the hall of the senate and finally Anakin all armored up as Darth Vader.Now for those speculations -First Padm&eacute; dying - well there is no evidence of her death or for that matter dying during childbirth, nor is there evidence that she lives three years after the movie allowing Leia to get to know her mother. Both of these are speculation. Seeing Qui-Gon's spirit is another speculation, as is General Grievous being constructed from Darth Maul's torso. The whole review titled ""Anakin is deceived into becoming Darth Vader!"" is pure speculation based on educational guesses from the novels. What this person fails to take into consideration is that although all of the ""Star Wars"" novels are pre-approved by George Lucas that they are not canon - in fact had any of the plot of one of the movies been revealed prior to the movie release Lucas would not have approved it at all - this being the case I believe this review to be nothing more than following the bread crumbs to an incorrect conclusion. This person's facts are in place but this person is reading the facts wrong coming up with incorrect conclusions - please don't let this person investigate crimes, somebody will be falsely accused & convicted. There is also no evidence that Dooku will be beheaded by Anakin, nor is there evidence that Chewbacca will be the only surviving Wookie (in fact that is very unlikely to those of us who have seen ""The Star Wars Holiday Special,"" and also no evidence that Anakin will kill Mace Windu. A lot of things that happen before ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" may happen in ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" but a lot of these reviews are based in mere speculation - sure we know that Obi-Wan & Luke end up on Tatoonie, that Yoda will end up on Dagobah and that Leia will end up on Alderaan, but that does not mean we will see that in this movie. Also one person stated that since Padm&eacute; was a queen that is why Leia was a princess and that it makes Luke a prince - but if this person was paying attention to ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" this person would have realized that the Naboo are a matriarchal society with an elected queen. Since the queen of the Naboo is an elected office there is no royalty and no inherent title to pass down. It is more likely that Leia's title of princess comes either from her adoption or is an elected position on Alderaan. Also this same person mentioned that Anakin was raised as a farmer - wrong answer again. Anakin was raised as a slave till age nine and then raised a Jedi Padawan. And this person expects to see a young Han Solo & Lando Calrissian - however though both are likely alive at this time they would be young adolescents and are not likely to be in the movie any more so than Greedo was in ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" - in other words no more than a cameo appearance.Basically what I am trying to say is stop speculating, you'll ruin it for those reading these reviews. Even when I know the outcome of a movie I do not reveal any important points of the movie - I just give feedback on things that are common knowledge and not giving away the surprises.Now on to the movie review itself. I must admit that I was weak and broke down & bought the novelization of the movie and read it three times before actually seeing the movie at 12:01 AM on May 19, 2005. I purposely went to ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" prior to ""Episode III"" at 9PM on May 18th so that immediately after the movie ended I could go right into the theater where ""Revenge of the Sith"" was playing and not have to wait to get in like all the rest - it worked (however I did purchase my ticket to the movie online on April 30th while I was in Israel and picked it up the monday following Mother's Day after getting back from Israel on the day before Mother's Day). Anyway the movie is great, well worth a thousand times the price of admission. But don't let the corny start turn you off as it is setting us up for the fall of Anakin. (I figure everyone knows he is going to fall so I feel this is not a true spoiler). As I said the movie really picks at the end. I was a bit disappointed in seeing General Grievous fight after seeing the fights on ""Star Wars: Clone Wars"" that the good General was in. This I will say though is that his fighting may have been effecting by Grievous' encounter with Master Mace Windu in the ""Star Wars: Clone Wars"" cartoon miniseries. As often is the case with trailers, the trailers of this ""Star Wars"" movie is deceptive - and much of the way the trailer was cut gives speculation to situations that happen differently than one would envision from the trailer versions. I will not go into what was different. By the way many of the speculations found in other reviews are correct, while others are totally wrong and if you were like I and read the book first - the book also fails the follow Lucas' version of the story. But this was a kick ass movie and well worth seeing and then buying the DVD.This was a great movie and although Lucas has stated this is the last - I really do not believe him. I feel he will in time release more chapters or as he has stated more television ""Star Wars."""	5.0	The third chapter in the greatest film saga ever conceived!	2005-08-27	7	5	2

I can't believe I've waited 24 years to see this film.A) The acting was horrible.  Padme and Anakin have no emotion in their dialogue.  I think every line was instructed to be delivered ""breathlessly""B) Do we NEED a 3 minute transition from each planet to the next?C) The motivations for the turn to the darkside were unrealistic and laughable at best.  I particularly love the death of Count Dooku: Palpatine: ""Kill him"" Anakin: ""I don't think I should."" Palpatine: ""Do it!"" Anakin: *SLICE* ""I don't think I should have done that.""D) The somehow managed to make James Earl Jones sound whiny.

I would've liked to see more of the ships flying around. Dogfights, like in ROTJ. Have the camera cut to more characters, possibly playing ""chicken"" with the Separatist droid fighters. I must say Ian McDiarmid's performance was far superior in this one than in Jedi. I loved how his dialogue slowly revealed who he was and what his intentions were. I would've preferred to see more of the Kashyyk battle, I think that was a bit short. Yoda's role in this film was flawless. Especially when he walks in to Palpatine's office and just force throws the two ""Imperial Guards"" into the wall. But I loved Palpatine's evil laugh when he starts going at it with Yoda.

This is the best star wars film. I have read star wars ""purist"" complain and complain about the acting and dialogue of the film. But what these purist forget is the orginal triology is full of bad acting, plot holes and dialogue.At one point Harrison Ford says to chewy "" Laugh it up fuzzball"" Come on that is corny as hell. The problem is to many adults are viewing the movie the adult eyes. THE REASON THE ORGINALS SEEMED SO GOOD WAS BECAUSE YOU WERE 12. YOU ADULTS NEED TO ACCEPT YOUR CHILDHOOD IS OVER. YOU CAN NEVER GO BACK. Star wars is for 8 to 14  year olds. Kids you do not have to deal with bills, and o.p.p (OLD PEOPLE PROBLEMS)If you were to really watch the orginals you would see that they are no different than the new ones. STAR WARS HAS NOT CHANGED YOU HAVE. When i watch them I accept them for what the are A LONG GREAT ENTERTAING MOVIE. NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1LVZOK9F7K4CN	JR Pinto	"Revenge of the Sith is the first of the new Star Wars movies that actually feels like it is part of the Original Trilogy.  Perhaps that is because there's actually a WAR GOING ON!  The franchise is called ""Star WARS"" after all...and don't hit me with the trade dispute in Episode I.  The Clone Wars didn't even start until the end of Episode II.  This movie gets right what the other movies get wrong.  There's actually something at stake in this movie - there's ACTION.The previous movies felt too thin - they really didn't have that much story to tell so they were stretched and padded out.  Revenge of the Sith is bursting with story to tell.  There's so much story that it can't all seem to fit into this movie.  (I think a lot of this material was covered in the animated Clone Wars series.)  First there's Count Dooku, then there's General Grievous.  The Jedi barely have time to deal with them before the REAL villains show themselves.That's not to say there isn't anything wrong with the film - there is: most notably, all the ""romantic"" scenes between Anakin and Padme.  The audience I saw the film with laughed out loud at some of the corny dialogue they have together.  Another problem I had was the transformation of Anakin into you-know-who: it seemed too abrupt and not properly motivated.These are minor drawbacks, however.  All in all, this is a very moving film - especially for anyone like me who grew up with them and was there from the beginning.  We get to meet some more old friends before saying goodbye for the last time.  I hear there's going to be another TV series.  I hope so - there's still a lot of mythology to clear up.

From birth, I can remember seeing them first on the small screen, the once again when they re-released the first episodes back to theaters.  I must say this was an amazing ending to such a great series.  It ties up all lose ends and answers many haunting questions.This story picks up right where Attach of the Clones ended.  It showed how to Republic was slowing turning itself into an Empire.  The dark side becomes more and more appealing to young Skywalker after the loss of his dear mother.  Skywalker has taken friendship with the Emperor, not knowing that he himself is a Sith Lord.  This led him to a controversy, follow the Jedi way or follow the path the dark side.Even though the ending is known, it still comes as a great shock to all audience members.  Great movie to go see, even for the non-Star Wars fan.  I would suggest seeing it more then once in order to pick up on the subtle details.	5.0	The End of a Dynasty	2005-07-28	4	3	1

This scene looks  how bad they work. They discuss with Grievous, trying to rescue Shaak Ti, but Grievous kill her and both should run. Too boring escape.2.- A stirring in the senate (Bail's office)Wow, Padm&eacute; looks nice, but not too pretty. She wears a nice brown dress and a curly hair. The scene talks about policy, and policy, and more policy... they are discussing about a rebellion helped by the Jedi or talk first with Palpatine. Boring again.3.- Seed's of rebellion (Padme's apartment)Woooow, now Padm&eacute; really looks too pretty... why does not she looks in other movie scenes as in this?... is a mystery. She wears other nice dress and the same curly hair, but looks  better than the last scene. What about this scene? Policy, policy, and more policy, blah, blah, blah about same line, Jedi or Palpatine?.4.- Confronting the Chancellor (Palpatine's office)What a hell !! well, at least, they decide to talk first with Palpatine, but they talk about the same, policy and more policy. In this time Palpatine assumes that something is wrong with Padm&eacute; and Anakin says that may be he's wrong. Whatever, is a scene about Palpatine assumes that are something about Anakin and Padm&eacute;. How looks Padm&eacute; ? terrifying, is a bear ? a giant ewok ? Nooo is Padm&eacute; in a horrible brown dress.5.- A plot to destroy the Jedi?Obi Wan, Yoda and Mace Windu in a deep talk about what is happening with the Chancellor... they are describing what going to happen in the next scenes of the movie, so this was a valid reason to being deleted.6.- Exile to DagobahWooooohoooooo!!! the long awaited scene when Yoda arrives to Dagobah!!!. First take... a blue planet...(as our beloved Earth). Second take... the dark and foggy forest. Third take... the spaceship arriving.... door opens... and Yoda appears thinking and maybe searching to E.T. !!  E.T. phone home !! E.T. phone home !! and finish... finish??? Oh my god... this is a fraud... the most awaited scene resumed in three simply scenes??

The plot is very good and the characterization of Anakin, chancelor Palpatine and Obi-wan was exciting to the last.  I think there were some details that needed to be more cleared at the end of the movie in order to make a real connection with chapter IV.01. The growing of the twins needed a more follow up.  There is a great difference between birth and real life of Luke and Leia in chapter IV.02. The death star could have been more in finishing stages rather than the primary look that can be observed at the end of the movie.03. Where is Han Solo ???  Chew-baca shows up in chapter III and I think some connection between Jaba the hut, Wookies and the bounty hunter could have been settled in order to have a more clear picture in chapter IV.04. Where the hell is Qui-gon-Jin ?? in chapter III, Yoda says to Obi-wan, ""prepare yourself because someone has come from the dead to continue youe preparation"".05. Too much time dedicated in the film to Lord Grievius.06. Too little time dedicated to Darth Vader in the film.Overall, been a fan of star wars from 1978, with in the 6 movies, chapters 6 and 3 will top de better list.  From a certain point of view, Empire's Strikes Back is the most complete and movie-quality chapter from the whole pack.However, chear up teens of all over the world, this a must have collection series of all times.

From the three prequels I have no doubt this is the best one. While I am not a great fan  of CGIs I must admit that nearly all effects in this movie work out quite well, the wookiee planet I thought was a bit weak but nothing is perfect. The death star under construction also raises some questions regarding timing. Was this death star so hard to build? How did they manage to build another so quickly from the Empire strikes back to Return of the Jedi??Anyway, is great to see that Lucas has managed to produce a movie that joins with the originals may be not in a perfect way but considering all the issues involved he surely did a very good job. If you haven't seen it and you enjoy this genre then you must watch it! I can't wait to see this movie released on DVD.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1VYD8OKS7VICD	"Juha Ylinen ""Heinijoki"""	I am recommending Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith. Lucas finally got his act together with this one. I think it is the best of all six, although nothing will ever compare to seeing Episode IV in Manhattan on the day it opened. The thrill and excitement in that audience, the screams in reaction to hyperspace transport, and the holdover of about two-thirds of the audience (including me) for the next showing, will never be topped. No one had ever seen anything like it. The subsequent two episodes are excellent, particularly V, and the revelation that Darth Vader is Luke's father and Luke having to kill his father are powerful and classic scenes. The long-awaited Episode I was appalling. Jar Jar Binks was the most annoying movie character ever created except for anything comedic done by Rob Snider or Jim Carrey. And I have never understood its thinly veiled racial and ethnic stereotypes. Episode II was even worse. It was BOR-ING and featured Dick and Jane level dialogue. In retrospect it serves only as a bridge and exposition between I and III. This one, however, has dramatic drive and tension. It just keeps building and it all feels like it pays off. So many things are explained, and well-explained. The dialogue is still mostly poor, but it isn't as annoying in this better context. The subtext of the movie, which is why I liked it so much, is the fabrication of a war to lure people into wanting more security and giving up their liberties. It is SOOO relevant. Hayden Christensen is, unfortunately, not a very good actor (he seems as wooden as the dialogue - or maybe he just takes direction to act wooden well), but Ewan McGregor shows again that he is a top-rate actor, particularly in the one scene he has with real dialogue and real emotional content. The Chancellor/Emperor is excellent and has one of the more complex roles. And Yogurt almost steals the show. They are able to make him so realistic now. It's amazing.	4.0	Here Comes The Dark Side!

He has the money, the company, and the power to do so--it is his creation after all. This doesn't make it a bad movie or good movie. A critic (whether professional or amatuer) has to look at this kind of movie differently as it really can't be held to typical movie standards--it is a Lucas movie. Let me delve into my review.Plot - BThe plot for Episode III is actually rather good and much darker than any other Star Wars movie (except, perhaps, the severing of Luke's hand in Empire or the death of Darth Vader in Return). The political intrigue that Lucas tried to weave into Episode I, and more so in Episode II, is even more present in this one. (Note: Watch the deleted scenes for more political backstory, and frankly these scenes should have been included--not deleted.)The movie begins with an epic space battle over Coruscant, and finds our heroes Anakin and Obi-Wan fighting side by side as they battle General Grievous' forces as well as the Trade Federation forces. There are some moments of awe with the special effects and the John Williams' music (slight nods to the original trilogy pop up everywhere in this movie). The battle in space becomes a man-to-droid battle inside Grievous' ship. Nothing out of the ordinary and some moments that make you go ""wait a minute"". For example, at one point, Grievous, breaks the cockpit glass and is sucked out into space. This leaves Anakin and Obi-Wan struggling to hold on and not be sucked out as well. The only problem is, how can they breath with no oxygen in space and why doesn't their tissue explode from the pressure? Maybe Jedi are that invulnerable, but I doubt it. The plot shifts quickly to separate Anakin and Obi-Wan (as this is probably done to put distance between them and initiate the ""fall"" of Anakin). Lucas, unsuccessfully, attempts to introduce more ""love scenes"" between Padme and Anakin and fails miserably every time. There just is no chemistry between them (character-wise or actor-wise).There is basically two stories running at the same time. You have Obi-Wan and the jedi hunting down Grievous and you have Anakin being lured further away from the light by Chancellor Palpatine.The side story is the ""hidden"" marriage between Anakin and Padme, the acknowledgment that she is pregnant, and the continuous nightmares Anakin has concerning Padme's death.The actual reasoning behind Anakin's fall (to gain enough Dark Side power to prevent Padme's death)and the manner in which it is carried out, is not believable at all (perhaps this is due to abysmal acting).The movie continues with ultimate betrayal and annihilation of the jedi. There are moments that make you go wow and send shivers up your spine--but just not enough to make this movie anything more than average.The ultimate battle between Anakin (Vader) and Obi-Wan is the most climatic (as it should be) and very sad. There is no winner in this fight as we all know. There is a very touching moment at the end between the two and that one moment made this feel like it was as good as the originals--but then you have to look at the whole of the movie--and it just never measures up. As Anakin (Vader) and Obi-Wan fight, Lucas creatively has the Yoda/Darth Sidious fight occuring simultaneously. This fight is shorter but nonetheless spectacular.The ""birth"" of Vader is remarkable and the ""scream"" everyone jokes about and makes fun of, is actually very moving as it shows there is still (even at this time) good in him and that he was ultimately betrayed by Darth Sidious. (Note: For the life of me, the movie is not convincing enough for me to believe that after learning of Padme's death, that Vader would stay with the ""Emperor"", and start a life consumed with evil and determination to take over planets and rule the galaxy. The way the movie appears, it would seem Vader would want to kill the Emperor and realize the bad judgment he made when he thought he was saving Padme. Power and greed corrupt though--so maybe that is it.)The end of the movie is perfect and ties in with Episode IV beautifully.Acting - FThe acting is terrible. The lines are spoken very woodenly by the actors and at times when they are meant to be serious, they sound almost comical. This is especially true with the Padme and Anakin scenes. (The balcony scene is perhaps the worst example of acting in all of the Star Wars movies.) It is pretty bad when a CGI character (Yoda) is a more believable actor than a real human. But like most, I didn't go to see the movie for it's acting.Music/Soundtrack - ASome chide the movie for lack of original music and for relying too much on themes from the original movies and the other prequel movies. To me, this movie had at least one outstanding original piece of music that was playing during Anakin(Vader) and Obi-Wan's fight. It was perfect! The other music was good (Grievous' theme) and the inclusion of so much original trilogy music, really made the connection to Episode IV more meaningful.Cinematography - BIs there such a thing anymore with CGI sets and characters? I guess so. It was stereotypical Star Wars which is not a bad thing. The space battles were fast and furious, making one dizzy at times. The interior scenes looked sharp. CGI is never going to look 100% real, so some scenes suffer. For the most, it is a beautiful movie to watch--so many different locales (like in Empire). Mustafar was perhaps the most interesting. A planet full or lava--can't beat that!DVD - APicture quality is superb, as is the sound. The extras are great with behind-the-scenes footage and commentary. The deleted scenes are actually interesting this time (compared with Episode I and II). There are at least 2-3 scenes in here that I am scratching my head as to why they were deleted. The Yoda scene should have been included--it was a no brainer!Overall - BIn sum, best of the Prequel Trilogy and maybe the 4th best Star Wars film. Definately worthy of purchasing for the Star Wars fan--maybe a rental for others."	3.0	It Is What It Is - Better Than Episodes 1 & 2, But Not Even Close To The Originals	2006-08-24	8	4	4
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AIFXFHO2N9WJB	"Justice0309 ""Justice"""	"Over 25 years after the release of ""Star Wars - Episode 4: A New Hope"", George Lucas finally brings his epic saga full circle with the 2005 release of ""Star Wars - Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith"".  This film is the one that 'Star Wars' fans worldwide have been waiting for, the one that would end the prequel trilogy, and wrap up all of those pesky loose ends that have been hanging since 1977.  Some were skeptic regarding 'Episode 3', after all 'Episode's 1 & 2' were far from being fan favorites or even critic favorites, though I personally enjoyed each of them.  Any skepticism was quickly dismissed when critics were actually praising 'Episode 3' prior to it's theatrical debut, and when the time finally approached, you can be sure that fans were lining up around the block to see this final chapter in the 'Star Wars' saga, and 'Episode 3' did not disappoint one bit.""Star Wars - Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith"" begins several years after the events of 'Episode 2', and around the end of the Clone Wars.  Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is now a full-fledged Jedi Knight and is still partnered with Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), and are both doing their best to end the increasing threat of the Separatist's and discover the mystery behind the resurgence of the Dark Side of the Force in the galaxy.  While Anakin has been trying to end the Clone Wars, his secret wife, Padme (Natalie Portman) is pregnant with Anakin's twin children.  What should be happy times for Anakin, causes great discomfort as terrible nightmares plague him constantly about the death of his beloved Padme during childbirth.  This tragic thought prompts Anakin to look for solutions to his problem in unconventional places and from sources that would use his fear to their advantage.  This search will test all Anakin holds dear, as his anger grows increasingly stronger, and he is pushed farther towards the Dark Side, and his destiny to become Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith.""Star Wars - Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith"" provides everything a 'Star Wars' fan could dream of, it neatly wraps up the loose ends created by the first 2 chapters in the prequel trilogy, and also those created by the original trilogy that began in 1977.  With possibly the best writing and acting out of the entire prequel trilogy, it comes as no surprise that critics actually enjoyed this film, as George Lucas masterfully captures the all-to human emotion of fear, and how this motive, if properly fed and manipulated, could drive one to make drastic choices.Incredible CGI effects and a very potent, emotionally charged story, with great acting, makes ""Star Wars - Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith"" one of the best 'Star Wars' movies ever made, possibly rivaling the beloved favorite ""Star Wars - Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back"".  'Episode 3' is a great movie for not only 'Star Wars' fans, but also general moviegoers, as there is something that will appeal to everyone in this film.A momentary word to parents, this is the first 'Star Wars' film to be rated PG-13, but I would still consider the majority of the movie safe for younger viewers, but there are some parts once Anakin has chosen the Dark Side that small children may need explained to them or be shielded from.""Star Wars - Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith"" is rated PG-13 for violence."	5.0	Embrace The Dark Side...	2005-08-15	2	2	0
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ASTIL0U29D224	Justin Wrinn	My Episode III DVD came in the mail yesterday, a day earlier than the release date (thanks Wal-Mart!), and of course I watched it right away.  The 5 stars is for both the movie and for the DVD itself.  When I first saw the movie in the theater, I was slightly disappointed, especially at how Anakan turned to the dark side, but with each subsequent viewing I have enjoyed the movie more and more, and I believe it is an excellent completion to the saga and a good tie in between the two trilogies.  I see the original trilogy Vader in a whole new light now knowing what he went through in Episode III.  As far as the DVD itself, I was blown away by the sharp, crystal clear quality of the picture compared to the previous prequel DVDs and was impressed with the 5.1 surround sound as well.  The movie content is the same as the theatrical release with no added or tweaked scenes, which is fine except that it would have been nice if Lucas could have incorporated the Yoda landing on Dagobah scene at the end.  At least this was included in the deleted scenes.  If you already hate the movie, the quality of this DVD isn't going to change your mind. Otherwise you should be very pleased with what you are getting.	5.0	great DVD transfer	2005-11-01	1	0	1

Keep in mind it is a very dark movie!!!!More dark than ""Empire Strikes Back"".You will not have a good feeling when you leave this film. There is much Heartbreak with Anakin & Padme. At times i found my self getting choked up watching their last scene together and especially her last scene at the end of the movie. Also it is very graphic. Please leave the kids at home. The scene where anakin is transformed into Darth Vader is quite intense. Overall, it is a Great movie even for an old softy like myself.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A316M4C1IANSUG	"jwebb ""jeff"""	"I saw the original film (back when it was still just Star Wars) as a 7-year old in 1977. Seeing this universe for the first time was a life-changing experience for a young boy with a vivid imagination. From that point on, I was hooked and waited with baited breath for each of the following films. By 1983, I was 13 and too cool to still be buying the action figures. Yet my excitement over the release of Return Of The Jedi (Ep. VI) was still strong enough to elicit a sleepless night before opening day. Over the next 16 years, my love for Star Wars never faded. I was there opening day for each of the Special Edition re-releases in 1997. And along with the rest of the world, showed up in 1999 for Episode I - The Phantom Menace.It is at this point (1999) that my love for Star Wars began to develop into an almost defensive stance. Critics were harsh on Ep. I. But the fanbase (or at least a segment of it) were worse. ""George Lucas has raped my childhood"" was the cry from some disguntled Jedi wannabes. Many complained Ep. I lacked a cohesive plot (if anything, it had almost too much plot), quality dialog (come on, people-it's Star Wars, not Citizen Kane) and strong performances (Jake Lloyd wasn't that bad. Jar Jar Binks served his purpose as the C-3P0 of the film, and Neeson, McGregor and McDiarmid held their own just fine). Episode II-Attack Of The Clones showed up in 2002. Again, the critics and fans were mostly negative. Yes, the Anakin-Padme love story wasn't exactly Oscar-worthy, but I defy anyone to find romantic dialog that is any  better in Titanic (apparently neither Lucas nor Cameron can produce strong romance on screen). You don't watch Star Wars for compelling dialog, people! Yet in my opinion, Lucas produced two very good installments of the saga with Ep.I and II. He had a lot of backstory to set up and with the exception of Jar Jar Binks (who I had no issue with myself) managed to make  two kid-friendly movies that still spoke to viewers on an adult level.So now we have Episode III-Revenge Of The Sith. I found this film to be the strongest of the prequels (I actually like Ep.I slightly bettter than Ep. II) and probably the best in the entire series since Empire Strikes Back (Ep. V). Overall, the performances are much stronger-especially McGregor and McDiarmid. McGregor has perfected his Guinness impersonation while still making the part his own. McDiarmid's Palpatine/Sidious is pure evil underneath that kindly, paternal exterior. Vader's Frankenstein-like reveal towards the film's end isn't out of place at all. He has become the Emperor's monster and will now have to find his humanity again in order to bring peace and balance back to the galaxy and the Force. Christensen and Portman still have some goofy romantic banter this time out, but is kept to a minimun. The action sequences throughout the film may be the best in the entire saga. And even though we know what is going to happen, Ep. III manages to pull at the heartstrings of fans and non-fans alike in it's final 45 minutes.So, whether you are a fan or not, Star Wars-Episode III-Revenge Of The Sith is certainly worth the time to see. It succeeds not only in bridging the two trilogies, but makes the other prequels better movies and adds a new emotional layer to the original films. The entire saga is really the story of Vader/Anakin. Seeing what happens to this character in Ep. I-III makes the Vader of Ep. IV-VI much more tragic, slightly less villanous and ultimately a much stronger cinematic archetype.As a now 35-year old father, I can wait to share the entire Star Wars saga with my daughter. She's only 3 now and Yoda scares her a bit. But when she is older, I hope to be able to watch these films again through her eyes (and in numerical order). As for Ep. III's PG-13 rating, if your kids could handle what Lord Of The Rings threw at them they shouldn't have a problem with what happens during Revenge Of The Sith. Well done, Mr. Lucas. The Force is definitely with you (although I for one never thought you lost it)."	5.0	A Saga Comes Full Circle	2005-10-26	11	8	3

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2BFC5WQGVP27G	"J. W. Kennedy ""in statu uiae et meriti"""	"Okay, I've watched the whole ""new"" trilogy in rapid succession, and seeing them long after the hype has died down (and my memory of the original trilogy has gone cold) I have to say they weren't as bad as I had been led to believe.  But they weren't very good either.  It's just a bunch of action & special effects without the charm or the intangible qualities that made the original trilogy stand out.  Episodes I through III are very run-of-the-mill as far as I can tell.This chapter has a very frenetic pacing, with multiple plot threads and lots of transitions between characters in different places doing different things at the same time.  This multifurcate plot evokes the feeling of the classic adventure serials which were George Lucas's original inspiration when he made Star Wars back in the 1970s.  It was complex to the verge of being confusing, but I was still able to keep up.  The visual effects and sound design are, of course, perfect ... but this has come to be expected of any movie nowadays, so ILM doesn't get brownie points for doing its job.What bothered me most was the fact that Anakin/Vader is such a schmuck.  He's whiny, spoiled, impatient, foolish and easily manipulated.  I have a hard time believing he could become the sinister villain we all loved to hate in the original trilogy.I did not notice so much heinously bad dialogue as there was in Episode II, but somebody (and I won't say who, because it would spoil the movie for you) shouts ""NOOOO!!"" in the most contrived and corny manner possible.  You're probably not _supposed_ to laugh at that scene, but I nearly fell out of my chair.  However, I was not amused to hear the ""Tarzan yell"" while the Wookies were charging into battle.  It seems like perhaps someone in the audio booth put that sound in as a placeholder, and somebody else thought it was funny, and somehow it got into the final cut of the movie.  It ruins the whole scene by turning it into a joke.  There's no other moment in the rest of the trilogy which descends to self-mockery; I got the impression it was supposed to be serious, so that particular sound effect in that particular scene was grossly out of place.Favorite character this time:  General Grievous.  But he raises some disturbing questions.  First:  Is it me, or did his accent change 1/3 of the way through the movie?  Second:  Why would a droid cough?  (Okay, he's actually a cyborg, but still you'd think when they installed him into his robot body they could have fixed his bronchitis while they were at it.)  Third:  I thought using a light saber was a Force power; an untrained person can't even get one to turn on .. so how is Grievous able to wield four of them?  There's a lot about this guy that we haven't been told, and I think some of it was necessary in order to make him credible as a character.Overall, this movie had more potential than the first two, but sloppiness in the details drags it down to the same 3-star mediocrity with the rest of them."	3.0	Not Terrible	2011-01-06	4	1	3

This aside, this is the most amazing movie in 2005, and goes on a tie with VI as the best of the series.  The fall of Anakin is very subtle.  Some people (me among then), though of this Lucifer-fall-from-heaven kind of epic.  But in the end, is a simple human emotion what drives Anakin to the dark side.

I went to the theater expecting to be disappointed but I was pleasantly surprised at the positive experience I had, watching the movie.  The first half is full of battle scenes, flashing space ships, and gleaming light sabers, but towards the middle of the movie, the pace changes, and the humanity of the characters enters in.  The romance between Anakin Skywalker and his wife is still a weak point, but it does serve as a catalyst which brings Skywalker to the Dark Side and his eventual transformation into Darth Vader.  The plot is better when experienced rather than explained, so I will just recommend that you not be discouraged by the less successful Episodes I and II and go see this one.	5.0	Tie it all together, it does	2005-05-25	4	3	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AXO137NC1GOTT	"Karl C. Nelson ""Fortune's Road"""	So, this is the end. The teaser trailer to Episode I told us that every saga has a beginning. Well, in fair fashion, the Star Wars Saga is brought to its end. Fans of the series upon the beginning of the prequel trilogy knew the outcome but what kept people in the theaters (complaints on Episodes I & II notwithstanding) was that people wanted to see the details of the journey. In all its glory, the tragic figure of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader in this concluding feature makes Hamlet seem absolutely blessed.There were certain aspects of the film that seemed to be truncated. Skywalker's decision to finally betray the Jedi is made seemingly on the spur of the moment when he abandons his Jedi identity to the role of Vader almost on a whim. While tension had indeed been building between Skywalker and the Jedi Council, to jettison that life in a matter of moments did not seem realistic.A word about Ian McDiarmand. He played his role with a deliciously duplicitous flair. Observing his actions in all the sociapathic precision with which he attained his rise to power, one sees other villains in film history appear positively incompetant. George Lucas has given us the most accurate manifestation of pure evil to which Ian McDiarmand accomplished with chilling efficiency. If the Academy was watching, then it would be my recommendation that he be given serious consideration to a Best Supporting Actor nomination.Overall, Episode III is a fine movie. Where it is placed in the scale of the other Star Wars films I leave to the individual tastes of the audience. For those who toiled in line for the days and weeks preceding the premier, as far as I'm concerned, I think it was probably worth it.But then again, that's just me.	4.0	Full Circle. . .	2005-05-19	5	3	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AVZ8NX1P8QPCG	"Katie Carter ""Kodaprn"""	"War! The first word of the beginning scroll of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith holds more meaning than the rest of the introduction. At the start of the final installment to the Star Wars saga, the galaxy is in turmoil. The Republic is at war with the CIS, or the Seperatists, who are lead by the mysterious Darth Sidious. The question is...who will win?This movie masterpiece is, in my opinion, the best in the Star Wars saga. It's powerful, engaging, sorrowful, action-packed...in other words, it contains all the essential elements that a good movie should have. It is one of the few movies out there in which, in the end, the bad guys prevail.In this long-awaited Star Wars movie, viewers find out the true identity of Lord Sidious, who is, in fact, the leader of the Republic. All these years, he had been trying to seduce the young Jedi Anakin Skywalker to the dark side, and in this film, he really cuts to the chase. Waiting until the time is right, Palpatine (aka Sidious) reveals all, telling Anakin that the only way he can save his pregnant wife, Padme, is if he learns the ways of the Sith. And so, young Anakin morphs into the evil Darth Vader...but I know what you're thinking. So what?Well, I'll tell you what. Not only is this crucial to the whole point of the Star Wars movies, but the way it is done makes me believe that several of the scenes in this movie are filmmaking at its finest.After turning over from light to dark, Anakin is ordered by Sidious to kill all the Jedi, from the younglings to Jedi Masters. According to Sidious, ""Every Jedi is now an enemy of the Republic. Do not hesitate, show no mercy."" My favorite scene in the whole movie is when Anakin is shown marching into the Jedi Temple, the now-evil clone troopers at his side. This particular part of the movie is my favorite. Though it lasts only about five seconds, it is, in my opinion, the most powerful scene in the movie.However, not all the Jedi are in the Temple. Several of the Jedi are off fighting in the war, and so Sidious orders the clone troopers to take them all out. Another deeply moving (and sad) series of scenes shows many of our beloved Jedi characters that we all know and love being murdered. The way it is filmed from the music playing in the background make this part of the movie unforgettable.Near the end of the movie, Anakin engages in a fierce lightsaber duel with his former mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi. They battle on the fiery planet of Mustafar, and the flames bursting up around them as they fight immediately makes one think of hell (I actually think this was director George Lucas's intention). At the end of the battle, Kenobi reluctantly chops off Anakin's legs and leaves his former companion to burn. Later, Sidious arrives and rescues Anakin. Anakin is burned so badly that he must wear a special suite and helmet, which is to become the trademark outfit of Darth Vader.At this same time, on the planet Polis Massa, Anakin's wife gives birth to twins. However, though she is perfectly healthy, she cannot hold on any longer, for the man she has come to love has betrayed her. Now, let me clear this up right now: Padme does not die because Anakin choked her. She does not die in childbirth, as Anakin had been afraid of. No, Padme dies of a broken heart.The last scene in the movie shows the twins being delivered their foster families, the daughter, Leia, going to live with Senator Bail Organa, and the son, Luke, going to live with his uncle and aunt. The powerful ending really sets the stage for the original Star Wars trilogy, and leaves you wanting to go back and watch A New Hope again.The music in this movie also makes it great. Composed by John Williams, several new scores, including the Battle of the Heroes, were created just for this film. Listening to the music, you can tell that the mood is sadness, and even anger, which goes with the theme of the movie completely.I must say, this is my favorite movie. It doesn't even compare to the last two, The Phantom Menace and the Attack of the Clones. It's dark and scarier than any other Star Wars movie, earning it the first PG-13 rating. And, complete with over 6 hours of bonus features, such as deleted scenes and several documentaries, this is one movie that is essential to anyone's, not just Star Wars fans, DVD collection.I guess that now there is only one more thing to say:May the Force be with you."	5.0	Dark Side Prevails	2005-11-16	9	6	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3DUK3A78XYVXC	"Katie Cooper ""Cookie Monster"""	First I'd like to say that I would have given this movie five stars, if it hadn't been for several points that I'd like to mention. Of course, this movie is absolutely better than the last two prequels, in which appeared terrible characters like Jar Jar Binks. In this movie, there are droids that joke around and some repetitive fighting scenes, but other than that, it's fine.The movie starts off with Anakin Skywalker and his Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who are on a mission to rescue Chancellor Palpatine from the hands of a new villain called General Grievous. They brilliantly (and with a lot of computer graphic) finish their mission and come back, not without suspense. Back at Coruscant, Anakin finds that his wife Padme is pregnant. Soon he dreams of Padme dying in childbirth...a dream very likely to happen, because his mother had died when he dreamed she would.Confused and frustrated, Anakin consults Master Yoda, but he isn't of any help. Meanwhile, Chancellor Palpatine (later the Emperor) is setting a plot to draw Anakin to his side...Anakin's wills crash with those of the Jedi Council, and he comes to distrust the Jedi more and more. The Chancellor recommends Anakin for a mission to kill General Grievous, but the Council sends Obi-Wan. After Obi-Wan has completed his mission after a furious lightsaber duel with the droid leader, Chancellor Palpatine reveals himself - a Sith Lord! (although we knew this) In midst of confusion, Anakin kills Mace Windu and become the apprentice of Chancellor Palpatine, or Darth Sidious, and is renamed Darth Vader (finally!).Vader, under the command of Darth Sidious, kills people in the Jedi Temple (including the very young), while clones kill all of their leader Jedi throughout the galaxy. Only Obi-Wan and Yoda survives. Yoda goes to duel Darth Sidious, while Obi-Wan is to fight Anakin...Although I knew pretty much of the story, I wanted to know HOW Anakin turned to the dark side. There had been signs, of course, in the second movie. But this one was the true revelation, the WHY of Darth Vader.	4.0	Star Wars is back,	2005-08-09	4	2	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A8F7MH0SVMW1J	Kazuma	"The admirable point about the movie ""starwars"" is that it always lives up to our expectations. Before watching ""The Revenge of the Sith"" I had already known, at least to some extent, how the story would be going on, what events would happen to the main characters, and what its climax would be like. But this did not prevent me from enjoying the movie at all. It presented in so compelling a way what I had expected that at the end of the movie I felt more than satisfied.Nowadays, we tend to pay more attention to those movies which betray our expectations in a good sense. In such movies, the story unfolds in such an unpredictable way that the viewers feel surprised and shocked over and over again. Obviously, Star Wars does not belong to this genre, with its story going on alsmost as expected, but this does not diminish at all its reputation as an excellent movie. Focusing on how to present what the viewers has already expected rather than on what to present in order to surprise them, ""Star Wars"" utilizes the power of visual image to its full extent."	5.0	basic, and good	2005-10-16	6	2	4

The acting was nearly absent, nevermind completely wooden.  Even by veterans.  Just disgusting.  Too much ILM play for me, thanks.I so expected to be taken in on a cruise like none other, as happened in SW IV-VI.  However, that was just not to be the case.  Unfortunately, as we have seen unfold in the previous prequels, I & II, the actors became less and less in the fore as CGI exploded.  What a pitiful shame, considering we know that Lucas & screen/playwrights can do so much better.Leaving the theater after Thursday's nights sad viewing left me feeling empty, rather than invigorated, over the ""last"" of the stories.  Perhaps the monetary intake from this last flick will urge George onto better once again - that is, telling the story of the Twins childhoods, and more of the story of Luke Skywalker.

It does an excellent job of bridging from 1 and 2 to 4/5/6.  All the loose ends I could think of are closed nicely, and you walk away with a nice feeling of closure for how the whole story holds together over all 6 episodes.If you haven't seen the others, I'd start at star wars and empire strikes back though, instead of this.  They were better movies.  This one has several drawbacks as a stand alone movie, namely moderate acting and poor dialog in many cases.

I like how there are enough scenes in the movie that do that.  Especially the scene with Beru and Owen looking off at an uncertain future, much like Luke in Episode IV.  The lightsaber battle between Anakin and Obiwan is top notch.  Its the epic battle that we've been waiting close to 30 years for and it doesn't disappoint.However, Ian McDiarmid steals the movie.  He plays the twisting evil genius to a tee.  You can definately see why they gave him the power.  You can almost see why Anakin fell for him.However, to really appreciate this movie, you have to watch it with all the rest of them.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2D9IEFJGB483Q	Kendal B. Hunter	"Visually, this movie blows you away.  It will be about fifteen years for everyone else to catch up with Lucas's art.  The opening sweep of the Republic Assault Ship coming over Coruscant, with the slow drumbeat of falling bombs and explosions is one of greatest openings in film history.As to the story, Lucas was painted in a box.  In ""Titanic,"" we knew the ship would sink at the end, as in this film, we knew that Anakin would be bent.  It had to be a downer. Period.  However, the magic comes in watching how it happens, and what happens to everyone else beside Anakin.The most unusual criticism has been on the film's politics.  First, Lucas is not a Hollywood liberal, but a Marin County independent. He intentionally kept out of the big Hollywood machine so he could do his own films his own way.  If you haven't notice, his films-especially THX-11388-have a ""rage against the machine"" text and subtext.  Lucas's main machine is the Hollywood Studio.As to the line ""If you are not with me, then you are my enemy,"" is not a paraphrase of the Bush Doctrine, ""Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.""  It was originally articulated by Jesus Christ: ""He that is not with me is against me."" (Luke 11:23), and is an obvious outgrowth of the Law of the Excluded Middle or the Either-Or Principle (Aristotle, Metaphysics, Bk IV; Plato Theaetetus). By the way, that statement is either true or it is not.The philosophy of the movie is inadvertently revealing.  Since ""The Matrix,"" the public wants their Sci-Fi to discuss philosophy. The problem is that both ""The Matrix"" and ""Star Wars,"" their writers are not philosophers, so they do not do it well. Furthermore their philosophy is on the level of the stuff I wondered about in Junior High-like wondering if I am really awake or really asleep right now, and so forth.  True Philosophy, the kind that was Socrates' meat and drink, is far more interesting-and tedious at times, which is why it does not do well in films.On the surface, it seems that the film is advocating relativism, both on the part of the Sith and the Jedi.  Both accept the premise that ""Good is a point of view"" (Darth Sidious), and that a lie a can be true ""from certain point of view"" (Ben Kenobi's Ghost).  However, in addition to relativism, Kenobi also asserts ""Chancellor Palpatine is evil.""If a lie can be true form a certain point of view-as both the Jedi and Sith Assert-then it follows that similarly, evil can be good from a certain point of view.""  Hence, Darth Anakin has the more consistent argument: ""From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.""This is why the Jedi lost: they were philosophically incoherent. Kenobi was trying to have his cake and eat it, too.  As Ayn Rand observed, ""In any conflict between two men (or two groups) who hold the same basic principles, it is the more consistent one who wins."" (Anatomy of Compromise). They both believed relativism, but sadly for the younglings, the Sith were the more consistent philosophers, notwithstanding their philosophy being wrong.Besides, if Kenobi really believed that ""Only a Sith deals in absolutes,"" then he would not have used the word ""only."""	4.0	Visually, A++; Philosophically, F- -	2005-06-08	8	3	5
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A7IIPRUAEZ2N6	Kendrik Lau	"So the saga is now complete with Revenge of the Sith.I have to admit that this one is much better than the bantha poop that was The Phantom Menace, and the wookie hairball that was The Attack of the Clones. But still, it pales to the original trilogy.The problem that plagued the first two movies continued to plauge Revenge of the Sith: bad preachy dialogue, bad acting (everybody is lifeless and wooden), characters you don't really care about, stupid useless references to the original trilogy (I love the way how Yoda paused for dramatic effect before saying: ""Chewbacca"", as if the audience would gasped: OMG! THAT's Chewie!), badly timed humor, and the ultimate scene: a misfired tribute to the Frankenstein movies with Darth Vader lumbering off the lab table delivering an unforgettable William Shatner moment (""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"").And of course, Lucas' attempt to tie things up are a bit forced and absolutely not convincing, and there are a lot of plot holes and loose ends:Anakin's turn to the Dark Side was rushed and totally unconvincing and I don't buy into it, just like his supposed romance with Padme. I never ever brought the relationship between him and Palpatine.And about Mr. and Mrs. Vader, the reason why the two of them are together was that Luke and Leia has to be concieved. Otherwise, there is no reason why the two of them should even be together. In Attack of the Clones, Lucas tried everything in the book to make them lovers and it still did not work. Ironically, one scene that actually worked (when Padme introduced Anakin to her family) was cut out. That shows that Lucas doesn't know when he did a good thing.The two-dimensional characters combined with the wooden acting and badly written dialouge induced no emotion or feelings in us for any of the characters. Like for instance, Padme's death. Sorry, I didn't felt a thing in her passing. So she died. Big deal. Just like the younglings: I felt more compassion for the jawas killed in the first original Star Wars.See-Threepio. There should be NO REASON why he should even be in the prequels. We are supposed to believe he was built by Darth Vader, worked for a time on Uncle Owen's farm, and years later Uncle Owen brought him from the jawas and he didn't raised an eyebrow that he has the same name as the protocol droid who worked at the farm years ago?Oh yeah, Gui Gon Jinn had figured a way to immortality which he passes on to Obi-Wan and Yoda. So who passed it on to Anakin so that he too came back as a blue image at the end of Return of the Jedi?I can go on and on and on. However, Revenge of the Sith is not just all sith, it does have its moments: Kenobi leaving Anakin to burn on the lava planet, and Luke and Leia taken to their adopted homes are high points which I was disappointed that there were not enough moments like these in the film. On the plus side, no ewoks nor Jar Jar's ""mesa"" or ""wesa"".Special effects wise, Revenge of the Sith is a triumph, but once again for the umpteenth time, Hollywood should realized that effects don't make a movie. Good story telling and good acting does.As for the the two set DvD itself, there are the usual ""making of"" featurettes and so on and so forth. There are 6 deleted scenes, particularly a couple featuring the Mon Mothma character. Like the movie itself, these scenes are stiff and sterile.In any case I can only give this movie three stars, and it is not THAT BAD, but I wouldn't say it was THAT good either, and I am amazed at the plethora of four and five star ratings on Amazon.com. I am a Star Wars fan as much as the next person; in fact when the first movie came out in 1976, I was already buying Star Wars trading cards long before I have even SAW the picture (and it was kind of fun trying to figure out the storyline). But come on, people, think for yourself and stop smooching Lucas' butt."	3.0	NOOOOOOOOOOO!......The Sith hits the fan.....!	2005-11-13	22	12	10
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1ADFVP7HVCRMJ	Kenneth Of The Shire	"I have often thought upon viewing the prequel trilogy, the intervening years between the original and the new.  To be sure, most of the criticisms of the new trilogy are adult in nature.  We speak ill of wooden dialogue and acting, convoluted storylines, and themes that aren't true to the nature of the purity of science fiction.  I was only five when Episode IV was release, so my only criticism of that particular film came in the form of whining to my folks that I couldn't see it again and again and again.My point is this: George Lucas has his flaws, most of which are related to him being out of the director's chair for more than 20 years before embarking on his new trilogy toy, but I think, more importantly, that we as a filmgoing populace have changed as well.  The fact that Lucas has been able to bridge that gap successfully (while telling the story backwards, to boot!) demonstrates the man's immense talents.  Perfect?  Far from it, but damned entertaining, nonetheless.Which brings me to the crown jewel of the prequel trilogy.  ""Revenge of the Sith"" is the second best film of all six, ranking only behind ""The Empire Strikes Back"" in terms of depth an substance.  The acting is better and the writing, if not terrific, is helped by a game cast and a pace that doesn't allow you to catch your breath.  Hayden Christiansan, for the most part, owns this role, displaying an adult gravity he was unable to display in the dramatically clunky ""Attack of the Clones""  The rage, frustration, and fear contrasted with Anakin's heroism and confidence in the face of battle made for a complex character who you found yourself rooting for despite the story's preordained outcome.The special effects, as usual, are outstanding, but for the most part serve the film this time.  There are points during the first two prequel films that you feel Lucas and Co. are simply showing off some of their shiny new toys, but in this film there is a more concrete sense of purpose.Dramatically the film belongs to Ian McDiarmid.  His performance creates the right balance of charm and villiany and by doing so makes Anakin's turn all the more believable even though the turn itself feels a tad sudden.  In fact, I dare say that I enjoyed McDiarmid more when he was under the guise of Palpatine than when he fully reveals himself as Sidious.  The scene during the opera is one of the great dramatic highpoints of any of the six movies.As for the flaws: sure, there were a few.  I would like to have seen a more galvanizing series of events leading to Anakin's turn, perhaps some more perceived betrayals at the hands of the Jedi Council?  I would like to have seen a more fleshed out performance by Natalie Portman, who seems to be more of an afterthought than a character in the third film.  (On a side note, Portman is a terrific actress, but was, in this humble reviewer's opinion, the most ill-served of the entire cast by the clunky dialogue that pervades all three films.)The one part to which I didn't object that seemed to be the bane of many Star Wars fans is the scene involving the birth of Vader.  I liked the allusions to ""Frankenstein"" for that is what Vader's story eventually becomes in the following trilogy: a search for his humanity, much like Mary Shelley's creation.I also didn't have a problem with Vader's reaction to the fact he'd caused Padme's death.  You have to remember that, despite the fact that he now has James Earl Jones' booming voice, he's still Anakin and still very young.  It does sound odd, I admit, but it's still completely in character.  You also have to remember that Darth Vader will have a good 20 to 25 years to complete his transformation into the cold, remorseless killing machine we come to know and love in Episode IV.In all, ""Revenge of the Sith"" does a terrific job of tying things together in a manner that harkens back to when I was a child watching Star Wars for the first time.  It's impossible, as an adult, to completely dismiss some of the flaws in the later films, but Episode III definitely comes close.  It is a magnificent piece of escapist filmaking that has heart, soul, and character and I would highly recommend it to anyone, Star Wars fan or no, looking for a fun time at the movies."	5.0	Episode III Not The Perfect Movie, But The Perfect MovieGoing Experience!	2005-10-19	66	52	14

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A26G35WR7QCFR2	Kevbo	"By far the most emotional Star Wars episode, Revenge of the Sith (Episode III) tugs at your heart strings in so many different ways.  It is the perfect ending to all the Star Wars movies made, and in my opinion, should be watched last - in the same order the movies were released.  (I know this is a prequel, but its emotion is stronger when you take the history of the characters into account before watching it, including what Anakin's kids - Luke and Leia - had to go through as they battled against their own father.)The emotional aspect aside, I believe the storyline and plot are a little too straightforward.  To me, the story seems to have been set up merely as the string which ties all episodes together.While that is a necessary string, the movie was surprisingly blatant and obvious in many parts.  The story wasn't as rich as before.  But I believe that was the challenge George Lucas was up against.  But from watching his ""Making of..."" documentary, he seemed more pleased that he finished simply doling out the final piece to his magnum opus.  I didn't sense that he had a lot of room to be fully creative in that, as he put it, ""This was the last one.""  So I think he was artistically limited to essentially present facts in as imaginative way as he could, albeit tedious.The special effects, music, sounds, and computer work were - again - fantastic.  Lucas Films is renowned for their grand work in these fields and setting the bar for such a genre.Episode III's story, while a little too simple, still played that crucial role in the overall tale.  For this, it is a must-see.  Therefore, my recommendation is this...If you plan on owning the entire Star Wars collection or just the first three episodes, this movie is required Star Wars viewing.  If you just want an action-packed adventure - without knowing much about the Star Wars history - you may only be fairly amused by the neat graphics.Star Wars fans, however, already know the tale is too deep to just buy one episode of the whole movie!P.S.I found the bonus features on this DVD quite entertaining.  I appreciate George Lucas' cander, as well as the detailed explanation of all the departments and vendors who helped put this movie together.  After you see all that goes into this production - and all the business and political elements of it - you will be, perhaps, even more amazed at the Star Wars franchise and George Lucas' empire."	4.0	The Most Emotional Episode	2006-11-27	4	3	1

I'll just give my opinion on the quality of this film. I think the special effects in this movie are good. There is a part in the beginning where Duuku drops a catwalk on Kenobi. The body looks terribly fake and is laughably ridiculous. The other problem I have is Hayden Christensen's acting. I have never figured out if he is just butchering his role, or is his character supposed to be awkward and almost expressionless. I know that Darth Vader is a wacko, but this is ridiculous. Those are the only complaints I have with this film. I really enjoyed this movie, and I think it's worth owning.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AA68BSG4MNKA6	Kevin C. Li	This is simply perfect, exciting and tremendous movie.  It is no matter how many times I watch it.  It is always great.  For the story, it is perfect.  It is exciting but it is sad and it is also about the fall of the Jedi.  It talks about Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) concludes his journey towards the Dark Side of the Force, putting his friendship with Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his marriage at risk.  Anakin abandons Padm&eacute; (Natalie Portman) and his best friend Obi-Wan and works with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid) and makes the whole place to a dark side.  He kills all the younglings.  Finally, Obi-Wan and Padm&eacute; find out that Anakin has turned evil.  Padm&eacute; is choked severely by her husband.  Obi-Wan knows that Anakin is already turns evil and wants to finishes him up for good.  Also, at the same time, Yoda (Frank Oz) also wants to kill Darth Sidious.  After the big final war with Obi-Wan, Anakin loses and he burns 80% of his whole body.  Luckily, he doesn't die because Darth Sidious can able to save him on time.  But due to his severe injury, he has to transform Anakin into Darth Vader.  On another side, after Padm&eacute; is choked by Anakin but still can deliver the baby but finally, she dies afterward.  For this, I think that she dies because I think Anakin technically kills her, which finally Anakin has to pay for what he has done for those innocent people including the younglings.  Anakin has beaten by Obi-Wan.  For the innocent baby (Luke Skywalker), somebody adopts him.  Overall for the story portion, it is great.  For the acting, it is perfect.  Ewan McGregor perfectly suits him for his role of Obi-Wan Kenobi.  He acts very well.  Hayden Christensen acts well for his role of Anakin Skywalker.  Also, Ian McDiarmid and Natalie Portman act well as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Padm&eacute;.  For the other casts, I also like it like Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu.  For the direction, it is real good.  I don't have to say anything about it.  Since this movie is so good, the direction is always right.  For the visual, it is absolutely perfect.  Especially the scene of the final fight between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, that scene is so explosive and tremendous.  For the music, it is very good.  It has always the dark feeling in it in all the war scenes.  For the sound effect, it is perfect too because when I hear them, I feel the tense feeling.  Overall, this is a good movie and it is always a good recommendation for all movie fans.	5.0	Perfect, the best 2005 summer movie.	2005-11-08	8	4	4

Nenstiel ""omnivore"""	With this prequel, George Lucas finally rediscovered why fans liked the original films, and it's not for the special effects.  The characters interact with each other at a fever pitch, the action serves the story rather than vice versa, and we get to see unbridled evil at its greatest.  This is one of the best Star Wars films, and certainly the best prequel.This story is sort of a bridge between the two trilogies.  In the first half of the film, Lucas offers the urban, highly produced political sci-fi drama of the prequels.  But as desperation sets in and the heroes realize their plight is direr than they knew, it becomes a more hard-bitten act of fear like the original trilogy.  It straddles the line well.And this story demonstrates the classic warning that the heart of evil is not vice, but having virtues without moderation.  Characters want peace and order so much that they take actions which destroy what the love most.  We are, at root, doomed by our desire to save ourselves.  We are all Darth Vader.This movie, probably more than any other Star Wars film, was engaged with real-world events.  Though Lucas swore off any polemical intent, his use of political catch phrases of the middle decade is hard to miss.  Maybe that's part of what makes this prequel succeed where the others didn't: it's not just a story, it's a contemporary parable.Viewed as a batch, the six Star Wars films are a hit-or-miss bunch.  This is one of the hits.  Despite the excessive hype that created unrealistic expectations, this movie remembers why fans love Star Wars, and what keeps us coming back despite several serious missteps.  This is what made the first one a smash hit, and it's a good cap to the story.	5.0	Bridge	2010-02-13	5	4	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A7WH560VVUXB2	Kevin M. Derby	"With ""Revenge of the Sith,"" the Star Wars prequel trilogy wraps up. While I had not seen the film since it was in the theaters back in 2005, watching the DVD reminded me that it was a solid film though it's not a great one. While not up to the standards of the original three films, this is the best film from the prequels though, admittedly, that is not exactly saying much.While the dialogue is still often stiff, George Lucas did a better job of writing here than he did with the other two films. However, way too much information is left for the expanded universe and not included in the movie--starting off with a giant battle, trying to figure out what General Grevious is exactly, etc. The film seemed very rushed as Lucas tried to wrap things up and shift from prequels to the original trilogy.The acting is better from the other films. Hayden Christensen is better than he was in ""Attack of the Clones"" but still a weak lead. Ewan MacGregor is excellent as is Ian McDiarmid. Christopher Lee provides his usual excellent--if way too short--performance. Natalie Portman seems a bit underused here as does Samuel L. Jackson.The special effects are better than they were in the other prequels and--thankfully--Jar Jar Binks does not say a word. John Williams delivers once again on the soundtrack. Going through the DVDs, the deleted scenes were enjoyable though they generally did not add much to the film.While the film does answer some questions lingering from the original films and ranks as the best of the prequels, ""Revenge of the Sith"" does not exactly serve as a satisfying capstone for the entire Star Wars saga. It's simply too rushed and movies should not force viewers to go to other sources--novels, cartoon shows, comics--to fully understand what is happening.While there are some thrilling battle scenes, ""Revenge of the Sith"" does not leave much of a lasting impression. It is a much darker film than the other five and really could have used some humor. This can be done. While ""Empire Strikes Back"" is a darker film than ""A New Hope,"" humor--mainly from Han Solo and C3PO--helps alleviate the tone and makes it more enjoyable. Something like that could have helped ""Revenge of the Sith"" though, admittedly, it is a much darker film than ""Empire Strikes Back."""	3.0	Solid But Rushed Ending to the Prequels	2012-09-19	1	1	0

Anakin goes to the dark side, jedi are proclaimed rebels, and so forth. However, knowing is one thing, seeing is another. I can garuantee you that there was not a person in that theatre who's heart didn't wrench just a bit while seeing Anakin turn bad. Special effects were much better this time around and the lightsaber duels were absolutely thrilling. So for anyone out there, I highly recommend this movie.	5.0	I've seen it.......and it's GREAT	2005-05-19	3	2	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"First off, let me say that ""Sith"" is a pure action movie.  As such it works just fine and is head and shoulders above many of its contemporaries.  However, when compared to the original films and even the other prequels, ""Sith"" is pretty short on substance.Visually, this is the best of the prequels to watch.  There are colors abound, from the Wookiee planet's green surroundings to the explosive and fiery reds of the lava planet.  There are the cold, lifeless colors of Coruscant, where the Empire takes control, and a brief glimpse of Tattooine, Luke Skywalker's eventual home.  The majority of the characters in this flick are digitally rendered.  There are a ton of clone troopers who have an obvious fake look to them when they run, gather in groups, etc.  The creatures in this flick, minus the puppet wizardry of Phil Tippett's creations of the original movies, come across more as a video game than actual creatures.  Unfortunately, it seems that George Lucas got a little bit too gratuitous with the special effects.  That's probably the largest downfall of this film.  Visuals and the ""gee-whiz"" factor are great, but they can only carry a film so far.The one good digitally rendered character in this flick is General Grievous.  I won't spoil his character for you, just know that of all of the characters in the prequels who have brief roles(Darth Maul, Count Dooku, Jango Fett, etc.), I think Grievous has the best chance of achieving similar status that Boba Fett has among fans of the original movies.  Grievous is a grand addition to the Star Wars universe.As far as the actual humans go, the acting is subpar.  Hayden Christiansen does step it up a bit in this movie, but he is hard to swallow as the future Darth Vader.  Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, and even Jimmy Smits turn in only modest performances.  Natalie Portman was rigid in this flick.  She had none of the flair or confidence that she evoked in the other prequels.  Her scenes with Anakin were so bad that they became silly to look at.  The Emperor also had a few silly moments.  His voice, attempting to change from senator to sinister, was laughable at best.The one shining star in this galaxy of bad acting was Ewan McGregor.  As in ""Attack of the Clones,"" McGregor's performance carried the film.  He has developed Obi-Wan Kenobi to a point that makes you believe that he will eventually become Alec Guiness' old and wise Jedi.  In fact, this series of prequels seems to develop Kenobi's role better than that of Anakin Skywalker.With all of that said, ""Sith"" is still a really fun film to watch.  The action starts as soon as the opening sequence pans down from the brief synopsis that precedes all of the films.  There are plenty of lightsaber battles(one in particular done in excess in my opinion) and we all get the expected moneyshot at the end with the emergence of Darth Vader.  Also, without giving too much away, I'll say that Lucas swiftly and neatly sets the stage for the original films to take place.  In fact, that's one of the best parts of this film, it does a really good job of setting up the story of the original heroes.Simply put, if you love Star Wars, see this flick.  If you're just looking for some good action, this one fits the bill.  If you're looking for a truly deep experience, look elsewhere."	4.0	Best Of The Prequels, But Still Falls Short	2005-05-23	3	2	1

But, Episode 3: Revenge Of The Sith is a very good Star Wars Film. The film that shows the beginning of Darth Vader, and the end of Anakin Skywalker.Hayden Christensen did a good job playing an angry Anakin and this is Ewan McGregor's best performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi. This one is more violent and more disturbing than the other previous episodes, but I see no problem with that.The film does have a few flaws, but for those who didn't see it yet, I won't say which flaws are they. You'll know when you see it.This 2-discs DVD has tons of cool features. Like six never before scenes created for the DVD realease.

I have seen all the orginal star wars movies from the first triology . I am not a die hard fan, but I do think that this movie answers all the questions one may have about Anakian Skywalker, which is how and why he becomes Darth Vader, as well as how his predecessor becomes the evil Lord Sith, but to come to this conclusion, you have to pay close attention to the dialogue between Anakian and Palpatine. To answer the questions about why Anakian(aka ,Annie) turned to the dark side, ""well for 3 reason . To save his wife, and other people from dieing,(remember mom died in Episode II), and for more power. The point is he was seduced by the dark side into believing he could do all these though the deceitfulness of Senator Palpatine. Personally I like the older triologies, especially the Empire Strikes back, it was the only movie of all six , that showed a somewhat softer side of Vader. Remember these lines. "" (Vader),luke (mark hamil) ""father(vader)"" son, come with me"", ""It is your destiny"", these words are classic."" Vader"" rocks. Lucas sums this saga up into 6 tidy little films that has become classics, so just enjoy it. P.S. personally I think Hayden is just a little stiff in all his movies, he just needs to losen up."	4.0	katie grogan	2005-06-02	2	2	0

"I rented this movie to watch with my children the other night. My son is ten and my daughter is 14 and their father has gotten them completely ""into"" sci-fi and fantasy stuff. That being said, even my children weren't all that impressed.There were a lot more duals with light-sabers than in any of the previous episodes so fans of action for the purpose of action will be quite pleased. But even these scenes seemed unconvincing for me. (For example, we all enjoyed Yoda's dual in Episode 2 much more than the one in this episode.)The transition to the dark side was to abrupt and unconvincing. To go from unveiling the sith-lord to killing very innocent children in a matter of a few hours or less was something none of us could swallow. My ten year old was especially disturbed by the decision to show the murder of the children.I also found it hard to believe that Padme would loose her will to live, even after seeing her twins (which were, in this advanced civilization, a complete surprise to all until time for the birth.) Her death scene fell out of the realm of believability and also deviated from the previous scripts.In Episode 3, Luke asks Leia if she remembers her real mother and she responds that she does. Well, Leia must have an excellent memory, because her mother lived for only minutes after she was born according to this episode.This film, honestly, lacked anything that would draw me in. The dialog was flat, the costumes were dull compared to previous episodes, the story line seemed more like a rough outline than an actual story, and the character development was awkward. I gave this film 3 stars simply because it was Star Wars and therefore wrapped up a story line my family has been following for quite some time."	3.0	A (Not) Grand Finale for the Star Wars Saga	2005-11-07	15	11	4
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A32K4BV5DFG3KP	Killerwokz	"This film was somewhat disturbing in some ways, and irratating on others. On the disturbing parts it is quite difficult to see a familiar charecter ,Aniken, so easily turn to the dark side and destroy all that he once held so dear. Padme,the jedi order, his mentor, all are destroyed by a power hungry ,fearful young man. The chancelor brainwashed Aniken ,using 3 main methods of deception, 1. Turning friends into enemies, and enemies into friends,accomplishing this with the standard methods of getting the subject ,Aniken ,to aggree on some small inconsistency ,then building on it. 2. Fear of losing his wife,and the chancelor being the only one who could stop the loss. Using this as a bait made the turn to the dark side all the more easier. 3. Perhaps the most important ,Aniken, was above all greedy for power and the chancelor offered him absolute power. The whole psychology of the turn to the dark side was laid out perfectly and brilliantly.Now in short the irratating parts What was the point of General Grevious coughing constantly. Why did R2D2 scream his death scream every 10 minutes it was really getting to the point of just being silly. Why does every one of Lucas's ""Star Wars""  films have to have some degree of chessy cornball humor.All that said i did enjoy the movie and thought the story rapped up nicely"	3.0	Revenge of the Sith -Gets a  C+ grade.	2005-05-29	6	3	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A6ADO7B6FUVN	"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org"""	"George Lucas created a world ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away..."", which was released in 1977.  Initially, this venture was called Star Wars, which later became known as Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. Millions of viewers were amazed by this tale where good fought against evil.  Together with strange aliens and powerful characters both good and evil were all united under one power, the Force.  Lucas creatively invented a whole galaxy with its own mythology, history, economics, and politics.  The success was given, as Lucas and other filmmakers released the sequel Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back three years later, as the adventures of the Luke Skywalker came to a conclusion in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983).Years later, Lucas decided to tell the tale of Darth Vader's origin and how the war between good and evil came about in the galaxy far, far away.  The first film in this prequel trilogy is Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999), which builds the background of how Obi-Wan Kenobi and the child Anakin Skywalker unite amidst the fight against evil.  The second part came as Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002), which introduces Anakin to love, and eventually passion.  Passion is a crucial element in the mythology of Force, as it could lead people astray into the Dark Side, organized under Sith.  To better understand the Sith, one should know the Sith Code by which the Dark Side abides by, which states:""Peace is a lie, there is only passion.Through passion I gain strength.Through strength I gain power.Through power I gain victory.Through victory my chains are broken.The Force shall set me free.""In Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith the audience is thrown into the film, and if the audience lacks the information from the two previous film from 1999 and 2002 it might be a little hard to follow.  Nonetheless, after the crawling customary launch text that explains the beginning, the film brings the viewers to the opening scene.  This scene displays a peaceful light of a star radiating over an impressive spaceship.  Soon after this hopeful, yet misleading scene two tiny one-manned spacecrafts with Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) fly around the ship to dive into an amazing space battle.  This battle must be one of the most detailed and largest space wars in cinema history, as the audience can see space crafts and droids, i.e., robots, shooting lasers and using other innovative weapons while trying to exterminate each other as far as the eye can reach.Obi-wan and Anakin's mission during this immense battle is to find and stop Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and his friends-at-arms, the monstrous droid leader, General Grievious, who has kidnapped the Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from the Republic Senate.  Their task to find and free the Chancellor turns into a flashy and humming light saber spectacle, as the two Jedi easily overpower the feeble droids.  However, General Grievious evades while Count Dooku puts up a tough battle of the Force before facing a different destiny.  This light saber battle ends with the beginning of what all devoted Star Wars fans know: Anakin's turn to the Dark Side as he later will become Darth Vader, who the audience has seen in the three films that were made in the 70s and the 80s.After the battle, which ends victorious, the story moves into a debriefing mode that informs about a number of subplots. This part suffers from too many quick jumps, which could have been saved with an additional five minutes, but the film regains it strength after this and does not look back.  The debriefing brings some of what happened in the previous film, Attack of the Clones, where Anakin fell in love with Padm&eacute; (Natalie Portman) and now their love for each other continues to grow.  To complicate things Padm&eacute; is pregnant, and Jedi are not allowed to form eternal bonds, as it could cloud the judgment of a Jedi.  To further explain this notion there is a Jedi Code, which is not mentioned directly in the film but it states:""There is no emotion; there is peace.There is no ignorance; there is knowledge.There is no passion; there is serenity.There is no death; there is the Force.""Yet, Anakin defies the Jedi Council and the laws of a Jedi by following his emotions.  Other side plots exist such as the Chancellor's interest in Anakin, which overtly could help the audience deduce the true identity of the Chancellor, and the Jedi Council's caution to allow Anakin to become a Master Jedi due to his passionate ambition.  All of this is set on a known course, as the previous five films indulge the viewer about what will happen.  For example, Darth Vader in the films from the 80s was heavily scarred and he was Luke's father,  as he said ""I am your father"" in The Empire Strikes Back.  In the end, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith ties up all of the loose ends in a neat manner in order to continue to the original film from 1977.Most of the film shows much better cinematography than Episode I and Episode II, in fact some parts are brilliant.  For example, the opening sequence with the star shining on the spaceship, as previously mentioned, displays the strength in the camerawork, even though it is composed of computer generated images.  There are also several other scenes where the camerawork is exceptional, and this truly elevates the cinematic experience.  The special effects also help, as the film is packed with cool CGI and fun stunts.  One should not forget to mention the cast, which is excellent in this film.  The cold presence of Anakin is well performed by Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor provides a look that resembles the original Obi-wan Kenobi, Alec Guinness.  Also, Ian McDiarmid provides a stellar performance as the deceptive Chancellor where he presents an excellent ambiguous character.  All facets of the making of this film conclude with a cinematic experience that competes with the fifth episode, The Empire Strikes Back.Ultimately, Lucas takes the audience on a thrilling adventure, even though the end will not reveal any great surprises, as he finally brings Star Wars in a full circle.  Besides being a science fiction adventure Lucas also offers several interesting notions to ponder.  One of these ideas that he considered is the complexity of the human psyche.  In this process Lucas provides an interesting and easily understood thesis that suggests one of the possible origins of evil.  Lucas even gives it a face through Anakin who eventually will turn into one of the centuries most iconic faces for evil - Darth Vader."	5.0	The Face of Evil Emerges in Dark Sci-Fi Tale...	2005-05-20	882	587	295

If you haven't seen Episode III yet GO and expect to leave happy.Episode I was a child's movie for a new generation of young Star Wars fans. Episode II was a date movie. Episode III brings it all home. Anakin goes from being a teenager with a bad attitude to a seriously troubled young man who doesn't know who or what he really is. He loves his wife but he can't stand it when she disagrees with him. He loves his mentor, Obi Wan but he resents him too. He loves Chancellor Palpitine but all his friends think that's wrong. The boy has skills but Mace doesn't trust him and he can't bring himself to follow Yoda's advice.We all know that Anakin becomes Darth Vader but the way he goes down is so shocking and sad it really gets you. One more thing, Lucas said this episode would be dark and he kept his promise which means you need to leave the little ones at home.

There are so many things in the prequels that simply don't jibe with IV, V, and VI it's a real dissappointment to fans of the original three.  Read the reviews here to see what I mean.But the biggest pile of bull, the ultimate deux-ex-machina, or lazy writer's crutch, is the intermittent coming and going of jedi powers.  Sometimes they have them, like when Yoda is flinging senate pod at Palpatine like it's a giant frisbee.  Then sometimes they don't, like in the same battle when Yoda is SOMEHOW unable to maneuver one of those same pods under himself to land on instead of falling several stories.There are other times in the movie when we learn that jedi powers, while they allow a jedi to jump three stories or toss heavy objects around, don't unclude being able to save one's self when dangling off a cliff of some kind.  In scene after scene we see jedi hanging precariously over a long drop, their powers suddenly vanished.Here's why: jedi powers are cool in fights, but then the writer needs some melodrama, so he robs a jedi of his powers momentarily.  Or, he needs to have a jedi die (like the one killed by palpatine who was looking completely the other way!!!!) so he has them, uh, sort of forget the force for a minute.

George Lucas has had plenty of time to think about how to plan the prequals to the Star Wars gendre. He should have set his ego aside and hired writers to bring that to life. Dialogue is choppy and corny, you can see where he wants to go in the story, but just doesn't deliver. He uses CGI to distract heavily and cover-up that fact. Amazing as the effects are, he didn't have that option on the originals(IV-VI), and turned out iconic sci-fi movies.Point blank, his own ego has ruined the prequals into childish, effects-laden engines to drive merchandizing and a sure sign George has taken to believing his own press to folly.Great movie if you're 10, but as an adult, hard to get through if you've seen and liked the un-remade originals.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A13BI7AH2F12AX	Kiran Garimella	"This movie is a major disappointment.  The original saga that was released a couple of decades ago had superb characterization, excellent special effects, and great actors. In the meantime, there have been major advances in special effects, hundreds of classic martial arts movies with great fight sequences, and so on.  It seems that just about everybody involved in making this movie had been living under a rock until now.  Special effects are idiotic and technically incompetent at best.  The fight sequences with the light saber could have been choreographed by a five year old.  Hayden Christiansen is wooden and can't seem to get any expression right.The dialog is completely moronic. Consider: Anakin's most memorable sentences are: ""I don't understand what you mean,"" and ""What are you saying?"" He goes through the entire movie acting like an uncomprehending village idiot at the epicenter of epic intrigues.  He unconvincingly resists the dark side, and then suddenly gives in easily to the most senseless blandishments from Chancellor Palpatine.  You'd expect a Jedi knight to fall only for something intricate, compelling, and monumental.Another example of the moronic dialog: when Anakin spots Padme looking ravishing, he bleats out a pathetic, ""You're beautiful.""  There is no exclamation mark in the delivery of this classically harebrained remark.  Padme's handling of this compliment is childish, petulant, and unbecoming of what her character is supposed to be.Chancellor Palpatine is cast as an insiduously powerful agent of the dark side, but his dialog sounds tired rather than menacing.  He seduces Anakin with pregnant pauses, soft speech, and with meaningful sidelong glances that are obviously indicative of villainy.  Surely a Jedi knight should be able to spot this farce?  Anakin's response is to look vacuous and utter, ""I don't understand.""In a futile attempt to give some character to Yoda, the writers turned his every sentence backwards.  Comes across he wise, in the earlier series.  Completely predicable in this movie, is his speech.  Redeeming utterances of wisdom, there are none.  Get the idea?  To add to Yoda's inconsistency, he comes across as a suspicious, conniving, doubting creature, and not as a wise, mature, mentoring teacher.What is perhaps most incongruous is that in a galaxy that has the technology to allow people to travel between star systems in a few hours or days, everyone seems to be fighting with light sabers, or sometimes hand-to-hand combat.  Why put on Anakin a hideous mask that is difficult to breathe out of if you have the power to bring back someone from the dead?  Haven't they heard of cosmetic surgery?If you must watch this movie, you would be well advised to turn off your critical faculties.Ian McDiarmid is unconvincing in the role of a powerful dark sider; Hayden Christensen is too wooden in this role - Jake Lloyd did a much better job as the young Anakin in the Phantom Menace.  Yoda comes across as a very unwise, suspicious, crabby master.  Ewan McGregor is forgettable (I have actually forgotten what he did in this movie).  The only redeeming feature of the movie is Natalie Portman who, despite the best efforts of her makeup crew and dialog writers, manages to look, well, ""beautiful."""	2.0	Disappointing movie, moronic dialog	2005-12-17	21	15	6

Through his eyes of darkness, you don't feel hatred for him instead, you would feel pity for this poor soul who didn't know what he was doing and where all his mistakes would lead.All the sufferings he endured like going to the dark side, betraying the council, ruining his own master's (Obi Wan's) trust and losing his limbs were all because of his love for his wife.He kept having dreams of her dying when giving birth. Of course, no one wants their own relatives dying just because of a ""silly"" dream. But it was not a silly dream and in fact, it happened to his mother too. That's why he tried to avoid her death no matter what. The price was a little bit too high though. Put together with his high ambition to be a Master in the council and being put down plus with Palpatine promising him mastership, he was totally brainwashed to the dark side.There were some very touching moments in the film which really made me cry like Padme's funeral and the part where Anakin's limbs were chopped off and his body caught fire. It was quite embarrassing but it was worth it.There's no doubt that George Lucas' direction of special effects were brilliant. The opening was just spectacular with the continuation of the clone wars. All those attackers and spaceships zooming everywhere made you feel like you were flying yourself. The sound effects were amazing.People complain that the movie was a little bit too serious. I disagree with this. The beginning of the movie was so much fun with R2 fighting back the other robots. I never realized R2 could fight like that anyway. It was fun. Really fun. You would never fall asleep throughout the whole thing.The last part where Luke and Leia were given to Bail Organa and The Lars family would really give you a mixed feeling . Sad and happy at the same time. Just to think what a real hero Luke was gonna be when he grew up. The construction of Death Star was very surprising because all I knew was that it was already finished in ""A New Hope"". I think George Lucas was really clever to think up a grand ending in Revenge of the Sith (the 3rd movie in the saga)and a grand beginning for the forth movie (which was the first movie made in 1977)All I could say now is that the movie was great with a touching plot.

Give him respect for having the vision, money, and determination to see Star Wars become the enterprise it has become. However, Mr. Lucas forgot about one element that makes a movie become a classic...a good script. Great storytelling is STILL an important ingredient for a great movie. In the ""A New Hope"", ""The Empire Strikes Back and to a lesser degree, ""The Return of the Jedi"" was able to connect with the audience because of the creative aspect Lucas dealt with good versus evil, father versus son, future versus past, and finally redemption. It seems with the new movies, Lucas is more focus on technology and not with the characters development and definitely not the script. Lucas should have hired someone else to write the screenplay because it is clear he has lost touch. The lines in this movie are so corny and cheesy, I felt embarrassed for the actors. I also saw that some of the actors (their face expressions was a dead giveaway) did not like the lines either, particularly Natalie Portman.The direction was also mediocre because it seems like a rush job. I really wanted to see the emotional breakdown, the rawness, the coldness and the realness of Anakin, as he becomes Darth Vader. You do not get that...one moment you see Anakin as a spoiled, conceited boyish Jedi and the next moment you see him as Vader. Dang it, I wanted to see a clearer process of why Anakin became Vader. I want to see Anakin-THE MAN as he slips into one of the scariest, darkest villain the screen has ever produced. Lucas did such a POOR job in the development of Anakin/Vader, that it is appalling he screwed it up this badly. I still do not understand how Anakin could be so weak and be so strong as Vader...it makes no sense.Many people have blamed the actors for their lame acting, but I don't. I blame Lucas for writing such a bad script and for not pulling what he needed out of his actors. Who can blame the actors for not being motivated when the script is so bad? For example, Hayden is a good actor, but he is young. He needed an experienced director to guide him in the role of Anakin/Vader, but Lucas failed him. Lucas was more concerned with the technology part of the movie and you can tell he spent most of time in that area. The special effects mean nothing without good storytelling and great character development. In fact, the movie comes across more as a video game.Lucas should have hired Steven Spielberg for the direction and someone else for screenplay, instead of him doing it by himself. After Peter Jackson's LOTR, the world knows it is possible to be a technology-friendly director and still tell a good story. However, Lucas has been coasting on his Star Wars fame for far too long, that he no longer has the magic touch or even cares. It is a shame really, because these movies are his legacy...his only legacy unless you count American Graffiti. Episodes I, II, and III are at most uneven, but now it is over for him. Lucas can now go back to tweaking, re-releasing, and re-packaging his glorious past (Star Wars) and ponder why he screwed up the Prequels."	1.0	A Lost Potential	2006-07-02	83	56	27

The characters could have been played with cardboard cut outs; they were so stiff and robotic. The reason Anakin turned to the dark side was also pretty lame and the film failed to show any torment on his part. Oh, well, I'm on the dark side now!

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1E85KPLPYVW8E	"Kolors ""Jimmy"""	"Although I liked Episodes I and II, I never got anything too significant out them as far as the story line goes. Maybe a few minor parts here and there, but nothing that really struck me. But now, with the release of The Revenge of the Sith, I see that Episodes I and II were merely a set up for what was to happen in Episode III.The Revenge of the Sith is the Star Wars movie you've been waiting for. Being the turning point in the whole saga, Episode III provided me with the significance I've been waiting for so patiently. Of course I'm talking about the death of the Jedi Anakin Skywalker and the birth of the evil Sith Lord Darth Vader. The events of Episode III were so intense for me, it was like watching The Empire Strikes Back again for the first time (I seriously almost cried at the moment when Anakin was being burned near the lava with no legs screaming at Obi-Wan ""I hate you!!"" Whoa intense) . And not only the rise of Darth Vader, but also seeing the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Empire, and the birth and separation of Luke and Leia were all great things to see. Good enough that I had to go home and put on A New Hope immediately after.Aside from being the darkest Star Wars film, this movie is loaded with action and more state-of-the-art special fx then even Episode II delivered. This is seriously a movie I will see over and over again all summer, and will most definitely become one of my favorite Star Wars films out of the six. If you haven't seen this yet, you're crazy."	5.0	The Big Payoff for Episodes 1 and 2 Doesn't Disappoint	2005-05-24	36	19	17

This episode answers all the questions, ties up all the loose ends, and leaves you wishing there were still more of the story to tell.  We learn why Anakin went to the Dark Side, how he became Darth Vader, and what happened to his wife, Padme, and children, Luke and Leia.Hayden Christensen (Anakin) and Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi) co-star, but the real star of the show is the incredible special effects.  The musical soundtrack is, again, magnificent.  There are lots of jaw-dropping battle scenes and some tender moments, too.Even if you haven't seen all the movies in the series, the plot of Sith is easy to follow, and gives the series a very satisfying feeling of completeness.  Yoda is back, along with Chewbaca, the robots, and even Jar Jar.  It's great to finally learn how it all began in that far-away galaxy, long, long ago.Kona"	5.0	How it all began long ago, in a galaxy far, far away...	2005-06-01	9	6	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AGKPTMTR3UX1R	"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here"""	"Taking place some five years after STAR WARS EPISODE II: THE ATTACK OF THE CLONES, STAR WARS EPISODE III: THE REVENGE OF THE SITH is the final act in the transformation of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader.As SITH opens, the Battle of Coruscant is raging. The Separatists, led by Count Dooku, along with a droid army led by the mechanical General Grevious, have finally penetrated to the heart of the Galactic Republic and taken Chancellor Palpatine hostage. The dwindling Jedi Order has assigned Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christiansen), now a full-fledged Jedi Knight and secretly married to Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), to rescue Palpatine.What the combatants on neither side know is that Palpatine is secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and that Count Dooku is his Sith apprentice, Darth Tyranus. Sidious and Tyranus are working together to undermine the Republic. And in fact, the Republic is dry-rotting away from within: The Galactic Senate has become a rubber stamp body almost completely controlled by Palpatine, who, unopposed, continually and unilaterally extends his term of office as Chancellor ""for the duration of this crisis""; more remote solar systems are acting independently; there are even the first faint stirrings of the Rebellion---""Maybe we're on the wrong side. Maybe the democracy we think we're supporting is already gone,"" Padme tells her young husband. Anakin, who has developed a close relationship with the Chancellor, is appalled to hear his wife's words.His rescue gives Palpatine the opportunity to order the death of Dooku, now a potential rival and the only other man in the galaxy who knows the truth behind the Clone Wars; Dooku is neatly dispatched by Anakin, who decapitates him with crossed lightsabers. This killing of a literally unarmed man (Anakin had just cut Dooku's hands off at the wrists in their lightsaber battle) troubles Anakin profoundly: ""It's not the Jedi way.""Perhaps not; but Anakin is universally lauded for his heroic rescue of the Chancellor, who is not the only man to tell him that Dooku was too dangerous to be left alive. Skywalker's star is rising, but as it rises it is drawn further and further into a sky dominated by Palpatine, who is already grooming him as the next Sith Lord.George Lucas has returned once again to his underlying structure of archetype and myth to show us Anakin's downfall. Steeped in Judeo-Christian (primarily Christian) metaphor, REVENGE OF THE SITH is the story of the Prodigal Son, the Fall of Man, and Milton's PARADISE LOST.  Anakin has become Lucifer, brightest of all the angels, doomed to be expelled from heaven. No longer an apprentice, and recognized to be the most gifted of the Jedi, Anakin has become arrogant, and indeed ""pride goeth before the Fall,"" never more so than in the cinematic life of Anakin Skywalker. Ironically, it is the Jedi themselves who initiate the slow cascade that destroys Anakin. Placed on the Jedi Council by Palpatine's request (a previously unheard-of act), the Jedi consider Anakin to be a spy for the Chancellor and unwisely attempt to marginalize him by refusing him the rank of Master. At the same time however, the Council asks Anakin to spy on the Chancellor. These two acts in quick succession convince Anakin that Palpatine's blandishments are correct, that the Jedi mean to overthrow the government.Palpatine, the serpent in the garden, also plays on Anakin's fears. Having seen in a vision that Padme dies in childbirth (she is carrying the twins Luke and Leia), Anakin is frantic to do anything to keep this vision from becoming reality, including studying the Dark Side arts which Palpatine falsely assures him, include the arcane power to defeat death. Anakin's soul stands upon a knife's edge, and most bitterly, it is his love for Padme which drives him finally into the darkness. At the same time, Anakin wants more than anything to live up to his brilliant potential as a Jedi. He reconciles with Obi-Wan and reports to the Council that Palpatine is the hidden Sith Lord they have been seeking. When the Jedi come to kill Palpatine, it is Anakin who demands that Master Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) spare his life for trial. Momentarily distracted, Windu is caught unawares as the Chancellor blasts him with Force lightning, killing him.  Although the young Jedi screams, ""What have I done?"" he also falls to his knees and does obeisance to the revealed Darth Sidious, who gives him a new name: Darth Vader.This handsome, young Darth Vader is far different and far more frightening than he later becomes as the black-clad armored giant of the second trilogy. Without questioning his Sith Master, he goes to the Jedi temple and slaughters all the occupants, including the youngling students. The unwary Separatist leaders, having outlived their usefulness to the newly-declared Emperor, are slain. The Jedi are decimated.  Only Obi-Wan, Yoda and a very few others escape with their lives. The Sith have their revenge. They are triumphant.Drunk with the power of the Dark Side, Anakin offers Padme the chance to rule the galaxy side by side with him, the selfsame offer he makes to Luke much later in RETURN OF THE JEDI. Like her not-yet-born son, she refuses, and her refusal enrages him. Convinced that she and Obi-Wan have conspired against him, he uses the power of the Force to choke the now very pregnant Padme into unconsciousness. Occurring at the very beginning of his existence, this venial act is, in it's own way, the worst evil that Darth Vader ever perpetrates: The infliction of pain on his own beloved Padme marks his deepest descent into the abyss of the Dark Side.Darth Vader is in hell, both figuratively and literally. The climactic lightsaber battle of the first trilogy takes place between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader on the planet of Mustafar. Very much like Earth at its birth, Mustafar is a barely-formed planet of steaming lava oceans, boiling magma geysers, and flame. In his defeat, Darth Vader is burned beyond recognition.Padme gives birth but dies of a broken heart. In her last words to Obi-Wan she presages Luke's words to Obi-Wan almost twenty years later: ""I know there is still good in him."" And there may well be. Rescued by the Emperor, Darth Vader is cloaked in the blackness which thereafter defines him. It is telling that the first words he utters behind the breath mask which will be his identity until the last moments of his life concern Padme. And the seeming kindness of the Emperor in saving him is exposed as an evil act when the Emperor lies. Palpatine's sardonic smile at this instant may be the most wicked thing to ever appear onscreen. Darth Vader must live with the guilt that he has killed the love of his life. In his guilt he becomes more pliable to the Emperor, more a prisoner to his own sense of hopelessness. With nothing to live for, he gives full rein to his worst impulses. Yet, even with his embrace of evil, Darth Vader is no longer just the faceless Sith Lord of the second trilogy, he is a profoundly impassioned, profoundly sensitive, and profoundly flawed human being.Although we last see them together gloating over the spherical keel of the barely-begun first Death Star, it is the heart cry that Vader utters at the moment the breath mask is locked down and his bleak, ""But I couldn't have!"" which remain with the viewer. In the end, Darth Vader is a man consumed by his own loneliness.As myth, REVENGE OF THE SITH is brilliantly conceived. The myth of Anakin is linked, thematically and in plotline with the myth of Luke. Many of the same lines of dialogue create echoes with the viewer. The loss of the hand---Anakin's to Dooku, Dooku's to Anakin, Luke's to Vader and Vader's to Luke---is a consistent unifying thread, the hand being the seat and instrument of action. And as each fallen Jedi becomes a Sith, there is a depersonalization process that occurs: Darth Maul is marked with Sith tattoos, obscuring his face; Darth Sidious's face is scarred in his battle with Mace Windu; Darth Vader's face is hidden; Darth Tyranus in fact loses his face entirely.As a cinematic experience, it is less than brilliantly executed. Hayden Christiansen perfectly captures the superciliousness of the maturing Anakin. No longer trepidatious in the face of authority, Christiansen's Anakin Skywalker is rift with the fault lines that will produce Darth Vader in the end. Natalie Portman's Padme Amidala has grown from a beautiful teenage Queen into a lush woman who radiates intelligence, self-assurance, and compassion. The remaining performances are workmanlike but unextraordinary. Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi remains stentorian and immaculate, never exhibiting the humanity---flawed or otherwise---that motivates his fellow Jedi Knight and friend.George Lucas takes yet another step toward convincing the world that he is a second-tier moviemaker who happens to employ first tier film technicians. His obsessive overuse of CGI and digital effects throughout the second trilogy, even to the point of altering the actors' expressions, prompted Liam Neeson (Qui-Gon Jinn) to make this complaint about his STAR WARS experience: ""We are basically puppets. I don't think I can live with the inauthenticity of movies anymore.""  Lucas seems to have forgotten (if he ever knew) that plot, story and characterization are the underpinnings of any good movie. REVENGE OF THE SITH succeeds because the tale of the downfallen, unredeemed Darth Vader is a seminal story in our collective subconscious. Lucas's layers of computer-generated hoo-hah don't look as convincing as the relatively simple effects of the original STAR WARS, and in fact, they become distracting. The final battle on Mustafar is so heavily enhanced that McEwen and Christiansen (or possibly their digital equivalents) get lost against the background. Special effects can be wonderful. They allow moviemakers to do what would otherwise be impossible. But there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. Lucas's unwillingness to recognize this degrades this second trilogy badly. These films, as good as they are, lack the cultural impact of the first three STAR WARS films."	4.0	"""So this is how liberty dies. With thunderous applause."""	2007-07-04	4	3	1

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A29R4FCO6RFX4K	"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy"""	The final chapter in George Lucas' epic STAR WARS saga ties up all the loose ends while proving to be the most popular and successful of the prequel movies. REVENGE OF THE SITH goes far darker in tone, and it seems that fans like it that way. Anakin goes to the dark side, the Jedi order is destroyed, and Darth Sidious takes over the galaxy. For any dark side fan, this is a wish come true. Some audiences have been left in the cold however, considering the razor-sharp shift from light comedic moments early on in the film to achingly tragic by the end credits. Starting off with Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anankin Skywalker (Hayden Christenesen) rescuing Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from General Grievous and Count Dooku, the film rides very smoothly in terms of action and character development melded well together. The momentum does get slowed down somewhat with some overwrought romance scenes with Anakin and Padme, but this movie belongs to MicDiarmid, who schemes, snarls and sabers his way through the movie, providing a fantastic character act worthy of Oscar.A notable disappointment throughout the film however is General Grievous. He erm, doesn't kill anyone. Especially confusing after all the impressive build up in Tartakofsky's fantastic CLONE WARS cartoons. But then the story is about Anakin, and thankfully once Hayden gets evil, the film rockets forward, helped by John William's wonderful score (But then, he's always good). Providing strong support are Christopher Lee's Count Dooku and Samuel L. Jackson's Mace Windu, along with an ensemble of impressive character actors. The standout is McGregor, who does young Alec Guinness very well. By the time Vader gets suited up and Luke and Leia are born, you know you've experienced something very special. The most tragic thing about the film is that it's the last.	5.0	Revenge of The Sith	2005-05-24	2	1	1

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1V8GY9ERC5T70	Kyle R. Pierson	"Twenty-eight years ago, going to the movies was a completely different experience. One new movie release a week was a stretch. Now, on any given Friday, three or four new hot films may compete for the Number 1 position. And even those that claim the prize often find themselves knocked out of theatres within weeks of release. Back in 1977, STAR WARS (later dubbed EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE) started a surge in the motion picture industry that forever changed the way audiences experience movies. The effects captured your attention, but the story and the characters were what has kept the saga alive for nearly three decades. Kids in almost every playground would act out scenes and develop their own storylines. Adults would make return visits to their local cinema to ride the rollercoaster all over again. Little competition combined with the fact that the movie played in theatres for over a year made the film accessible to everyone. Then, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK did the unthinkable. It improved on the original. Not only that, but oddly, there wasn't any ending to be found. No resolution, no happy ending, nothing. For three years, audiences guessed about the fate of Han Solo and questioned the possibility of Darth Vader being Luke's father. And ""there is ANOTHER?"" Who could that possibly be? The release of RETURN OF THE JEDI answered all questions and put the most successful trilogy of all time to rest in an explosive array of effects, humor, drama, and spirituality. One question still remained, however. When will we see EPISODE I, II, and III? THE PHANTOM MENACE was a visul spectacle, but Mr. Binks made the ride less than thrilling. ATTACK OF THE CLONES quickly learned from PHANTOM's mistakes by pushing silliness to the side and focusing on the story at hand. Perhaps, it focused a little too much on the story. Anakin loves Padme'. I get it already! The improved action sequences kept the film flowing and the characters were finally coming into their own. Now, REVENGE OF THE SITH just needed to pull it all together and fans would leave the series with the same excitement that was first stirred in them. Mission: Accomplished! SITH is easily the most dramatic story in the saga, and definitely the most emotional. Even though you know exactly what happens to all characters involved, George Lucas generates gripping moments that bring you back to your childhood. You may not walk away with the same elated ""wow"" feeling that you are hoping, and I think that's the point. As was the case with EMPIRE, you leave the theatre wanting more, while still satisfied by what you got. The ending is just the beginning and the desire to relive the excitement is reborn. As with every story, not every chapter will be your favorite, but this chapter tells a story not to be missed. What the film may lack in more expanded action sequences with fan favorite characters, it most certainly makes up for in powerful, moving storytelling. It may not be a perfect movie, but it is a perfect bridge between EPISODE II and IV. Having seen both the 35mm and digital prints, I can also say that the rumor of there being ten additional minutes in the digital version is false. Except for possible subtle alterations, there doesn't appear to be any difference between the two prints, what-so-ever. At least, not that I noticed.DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT - Unlike MENACE and CLONES, not one person I have talked to has disliked the movie. In fact, one person said it was their favorite of the saga, while another said it fell second right behind EMPIRE. If EPISODE I and II left a sour taste in your mouth, try EPISODE III on for size!"	4.0	SITH Scores!  Drama - 5, Acting - 3, Action - 4, Story - 4	2005-05-20	4	3	1

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2OG4TLCXX4JV9	Lambros Panayi	Before I begin, I have to make clear that I don't think The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones are disappointing films. Not by any stretch of the imagination. Revenge of the Sith, though, is in a league of its own.Literally.For out of the three new Star Wars films, commonly referred to as the `prequels' by fans, Sith is the only one that can actually come off as a stand alone film.We all know the story. Well, the skeletal structure, at least. We know that in the course of this two hour long film Anakin will cease to be Anakin Skywalker and become Darth Vader. But how does he actually get there?Sith kicks off with a gargantuan space battle involving a never ending array of humungous spaceships blasting each other to bits. The first thirty seconds alone are enough to win this one the Academy Award for special effects. For it not to be even nominated is a greater insult than any. After rescuing the captive Chancellor, Obi-Wan and Anakin, no longer mentor and student but more like big brother and little brother, head back to Coroscant. Make way for one of the best crash landing sequences that has ever been put to film (Academy, you should be ashamed!). Soon after, Anakin learns off his `secret' wife, Padme, that she is expecting. A happy moment, you would think? Think again, for that night Anakin has the first of many visions involving her impending doom. Make way for a very brooding and angry Anakin.Of course, there's more to it than that. But that's the gist of it. First and foremost, I want to talk about the acting. The acting in Sith is far greater than the acting in any of the other two prequels put together. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan-Kenobi gives a noble, comic and at the end passionate performance, conveying the mixture of horror and sadness at what his friend has done perfectly. Hayden Christenson is exceedingly better as Anakin this time around. Not only has he matured in real life, but so has his character. When Anakin goes nasty, Christenson gives a very compelling and tragic performance. Even when Anakin's saying things that only an evil person could say at the end, you can't help but feel for him. Natalie Portman has little to do, but when she does have something to do, which is mainly at the end, she does it well. The stand out performance, though, belongs to theatre veteran, Ian McDiarmid. In one half of the film he plays the calm, intelligent, stern Chancellor of the Republic with expertise. In the latter half, (and best) the cackling, pantomime villain performance escapes his being with such relish and pleasure that its hard to imagine him being anything else in real life.For the first forty minutes or so, Sith acts like any of the other Star Wars films. It's all about fun, loud bangs and amazing visuals. Then at the beginning of the second half, it changes. And yes, the change is big and very much `in your face', so to speak. The whole tone of the film alters. It all starts off with the `ballet' scene. Yes, there's a scene in a Star Wars film that involves two characters watching a ballet. That's what's great about this film, George Lucas has put in so many moments in Sith that you won't find in any of the other Star Wars films. In the scene in question, it's basically the first seduction sequence. The Chancellor telling Anakin of a long-gone Sith Lord who could save others from death. It's an amazing little moment, and knowing what's going to happen it's a very chilling moment, too. Complete with very chilling music.This latter half is basically a roller-coaster ride filled with horror, bucket loads of suspense, tragedy and ultimately, violence. Yes, this is the first (and last) Star Wars film to be given a 12 rating. Is it worth it? Certainly. The scene when Anakin actually embraces the dark side is a test for the sensitive amongst us. I wouldn't say it's violent, but it's definitely the most powerful and visceral sequence you will ever find in any of the Star Wars films. Oh, and it involves Samuel L. Jackson's character, Mace Windu. Sith not only contains scenes of violence that you won't find in any of the others, but I think it's the themes that it plays with that gives it more of an edge. Here, we're given child murder, mass slaughter, genocide and spousal abuse. Not really the kinds of things you would expect to find in a `kids' film. Of course, though, the only people who think that films like this are strictly for children are ignoramuses.All in all, George Lucas, in my opinion, has created a modern-day sci-fi classic. He's outdone himself, and I'm very proud to call myself a Star Wars fan.	5.0	REVENGE OF THE SITH	2006-04-08	10	8	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2QWA1Z5W7GSFI	Lao Hu	"In a movie where the two enemies are the separatist Trade Federation and a power hungry, war mad executive, one might expect a leftward slant. Lucas says he wrote the script during the Vietnam War and Nixon era, but that ""the parallels between Vietnam and what we're doing in Iraq now are unbelievable."" When Padme says, ""Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume,"" it's fairly clear what she's talking about.Lucas also takes a shot at George Bush and the moral right. While Vader and Obi-wan converse before their duel, Vader tells Obi-wan, ""If you're not with me, you're my enemy."" This echoes Bush's statement about the War on Terror, ""Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists."" ""Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes,"" Obi-Wan replies, with apparent absolute certainty. Who knew that fundamentalist Christians were actually Sith Lords? As the Jedi say, you still have much to learn, George Lucas.Lucas's latest film does not live up to the vibrancy of the characters and raw sci-fi brilliance of the original Star Wars. But by shedding many of the errors of his previous two attempts, he comes much closer. Palpatine shines as the Machiavellian corrupter of his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Anakin, and the viewer watches in fascination the sick symbiosis that develops between them. The sickness of the Sith, not the obnoxious Buddhist-humanist ""purity"" of the Jedi, drives the film. The melted Palpatine pleading for his life, Vader's fiery baptism and transformation - these are not images we are likely to forget.The opening scene of Revenge of the Sith is spectacular sci-fi. Anakin and Obi-wan's fighters weave through a huge space battle with special characters like Buzz droids, Vulture droids and a huge cruiser bay door. Once inside the enemy flagship, the Jedi encounter some truly impressive Jedi-killing melee combat droids. R2D2 is in high style throughout. The segment closes with an emergency capital ship landing on a runway built to fit. I only question whether the water cannons on those firefighter ships would really operate at reentry speeds.There are, of course, some flaws in the film's near-continuous special effects. Droid regulars remain hopeless patsies. Ground battles are standup, charge-in affairs that curiously ignore the advent of automatic weaponry. Lucas goes too far when he shows brief shots of space cruisers firing actual broadsides from breech-loading deck cannons like the ships of Nelson's day. Fortunately, much of the cuteness of previous Naboo escapades is gone, and there is no meesa-yousa sambo nonsense from Jar-Jar.The opening scene also reminds viewers of the emasculation Jedi have undergone since Lucas' original trilogy. Obi-wan's attempts at chipper drollness quickly become cloying. Anakin saves his master repeatedly throughout the attack while Obi-wan uselessly henpecks. Ewan McGregor bears no comparison to the steely and resourceful Obi-Wan Alec Guinness played in the original Star Wars.Casting Samuel L. Jackson as the leader of the Jedi counsel was another poor decision. Black men have successfully played gnosis-filled mentors before, for example Morpheus in The Matrix. But Samuel Jackson is a well-known face with pre-existing associations, and those associations do not include mysticism and monkish restraint.The film centers on Anakin Skywalker's transformation into Darth Vader. Palpatine plays his tempter's part with mastery. Starting small, he tells Anakin to kill Dooku, and gradually moves to greater transgressions. Ian McDiarmid plays a brilliant satanic character: covered in layers of seeming goodness and nobility, full of reasonable and persuasive justifications, snarling like a rat when cornered, filled with fear despite his deadly power.The driving force behind Anakin's conversion, we are told, is his fear of losing his wife Padme. But the romance between the two lacks any compelling power. We repeatedly see them saying they love each other, etc. The couple's predictable dialogue and poor chemistry fail to stir the viewer. True love might have been a fine reason for the galaxy-shattering consequences of Anakin's betrayal, but Lucas, Portman and Christensen lack the talent to portray it.The actual sequence of Anakin's transformation makes little sense. He cuts off Samuel L. Jackson's arm, yes - but Jackson was about to break the Jedi code by killing an unarmed prisoner. Anakin does not kill Jackson; Palpatine does. So why the sudden conversion to evil? How does Anakin suddenly switch from attempting to uphold the Jedi code to killing younglings?But the scene quickly recovers from Anakin's too-fast conversion. Palpatine's sick pleasure at the power and submission of his new apprentice carries the moment, and the Emperor-Vader dyad is born. Anakin receives his name, and his submission to Palpatine is implicit as he thinks along with the Emperor in his skewed, self-justifying, paranoiac worldview. Later, after Vader's disfiguration, the final hellish scene of Vader's agony is brilliant. In the cold and sterile theater, he smashes the vials and droids that have given him new life; the Emperor watches in sickly awestruck pleasure.No Star Wars film would be complete without duels, and Revenge of the Sith has plenty. General Grievous' fights are probably the best. In his escapes from the Jedi and eventual showdown with Obi-wan he shows himself a formidable and energetic adversary.Unfortunately, Lucas seriously botches the main fight in the movie, Anakin and Obi-wan's duel. Lucas needs Obi-Wan to somehow win this fight against the more powerful Vader. In earlier versions of the script Obi-Wan uses Anakin's hubris to blind him into committing errors, but Lucas discards this device. Instead the fight is a long sequence of inconclusive slashing with no advantage gained until the very end.Finally Obi-Wan says, ""It's over, Anakin, I have the high ground."" His assertion is counterintuitive to the viewer, who has just seen every possible configuration of light saber acrobatics, including one segment in which both climb a completely vertical tower in the middle of the lava field. Vader nonetheless tries a complicated aerobatic maneuver and is rendered a triple amputee for his pains. Why he did not simply hop across the small gap instead of trying the triple backflip is beyond me.Obi-Wan does show some passion and becomes a human character during his fight against Vader, which is a relief. Vader's subsequent baptism in fire is truly horrific. Here we finally begin to see the misery behind the black mask.A deleted scene near the movie's end demonstrates the film's Buddhist cosmology. Yoda has a conversation with the departed Qui-gon Jinn that underlines the connection between Buddhism and the Force. Qui-gon tells Yoda that, through compassion, he can learn how to retain eternal consciousness. ""No attachment, no thought of self,"" Qui-gon says. ""No physical self."" All of these ideas are very much within the Buddhist cosmology. Zen Buddhism particularly emphasizes that we are all part of an original mind, an idea similar to the Force."	2.0	Only Sith lords (and Republicans) deal in absolutes	2006-07-01	10	5	5
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AY4GOABYGVVN6	Larry D. Marsh	How the partial saga began in 1977 finally makes complete sense through George Lucas' Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. We find out what led Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) to choose the dark side of the force. To save Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) from death, Anakin believes by joining Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (aka  Sith Lord) (Ian McDiarmid) her life will be spared. As for what happens to those twins, we learn later in the film how and why they become separated at birth. The volcanic scene on Mustafar where Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin engage in a light saber fight leads to the unveiling of Anakin's transformation as Lord Darth Vader.Like all other Star Wars movies that preceded Episode III, constant battles determine the faith between good and evil. Droids shoot at no mercy to defend their Separatists Force. General Grievious (voiced by Matthew Wood) means business when confronting Kenobi. Two robotic arms on each side, with four light sabers in all, it'd seem unlikely anybody (including a Jedi for that matter) could defeat General Grievious one-on-one. Master Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) even gets in on some action, which proves size really doesn't matter. At two feet tall he has power of the Force, excellent reflexes, superb laser skills, and on top of all that he can also perform flawless back flips.The spectacular special effects truly stand out. George Lucas did a good job keeping our attention glued on the screen so we don't miss out on anything. If you leave for a urinal break you will feel out of place when you return. That's how it was in the theaters but at home we use the pause feature on our VHS or DVD system. A number of stunning special effects, in no particular order, include: Palpatine turning into the Sith, duel on Mustafar, development of Darth Vader, Yoda's mastery, variety of droids, and General Grievious's hidden weaponry.Awesome sound effects blast throughout the movie experience. The Dolby 5.1 EX sound is simply amazing. Laser shots and chaotic explosions keep you sitting straight in your seat. George Lucas probably made this possible so nobody could doze off and it worked. The three-hour film passes before you could realize much of your day was already over.Despite impressive special effects and sound effects, the dialogue continues to suffer just like all the other Star Wars movies. Actually, Episode III has the worst dialogue as though Lucas ignored importance of conveying realistic communication and instead weighed more on continuous action shots. Viewers may have voted for more action but that's no excuse for poor dialogue. Most of us can barely tolerate the love scenes between Anakin and Padme. They don't perform well together in front of the camera. Their romance doesn't convince anyone; pedestrians chosen off the street could do better. Maybe it's meant to be cheesy like it was between Han Solo and Princess Leia.Overall, a great end to the Star Wars saga. Plenty of action to keep you entertained from start to finish. Terrific movie for fans and newcomers alike, just be forewarn of the poor dialogue and the fake romance that hinders Episode III.	4.0	You will be Entertained	2006-01-27	4	0	4
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A30SAVOSM4ZM6L	Lath	"For some reason people (or as I like to call them, idiots) try to fit in with others and bash sequels/prequels.  Well shoot me for not wanting to fit in with ""people"" but this was a really good movie.  Probably the third best behind ""Return of the Jedi"" and ""A New Hope.""  It ties together all the loose ends with a nice blend of action, drama, and even a little romance (is there anything quite like breaking up to rule a galaxy?).  I was on the edge of my seat for the entire film and couldn't have asked for anything more.  It was the perfect film to close out the saga.Granted I am not a Star Wars junkie so if Mr. Lucas missed a few little things I wouldn't know the difference nor would I care.  I am a casual fan of the Star Wars series and enjoyed all of the movies (even Episode I).  Go enjoy the film and if some Star Wars dork is bitching during the movie make sure to accidentally spill your coke on him.Cheers."	5.0	Don't listen to the blabbering idiots.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AAEP58H79J67E	lawlady	Unlike other reviewers, I do not have a lot to say about the movie except that it tied up alot of loose ends and is a great tie in to the original series that we have all seen.No, the acting is not great and yeah there is alot of digital effects in most of the scenes but I went to see Star Wars- not Gone with the Wind.  My expectations were that George Lucas would dazzle me with special effects and tie up the story that he started back when I was a child and I was definitely not disappointed.I know how Anakin got seduced by the dark side, I know how Luke and Leia ended up where we first met them and I know what happened to the Jedi and how the empire was formed.  I know why the storm troopers were siding with Darth Vader and I learned the back story on the emperor.  I saw Yoda when he was younger and vital and he could fight and I know Obi-Wan's story.  I came out of that theatre feeling like I go my money's worth.Yeah the movie was somewhat thin on a real plot but I kind of figured that this movie was supposed the bridge between I & 2 and the Star Wars trilogy we all grew up with.  And it was.Because of this movie, I am compelled to go back and rewatch the original three to see if I can see Darth Vader through new eyes.  Now that I know his story, I cannot see him as the same villain.  I now see him as Anakin, who is  all screwed up with all hope lost because of his horrible actions.  I am really looking at this as though George Lucas did not just do one movie-  he really gave me three more movies because I can never look at the first three the same way again now that I know the back stories of Luke and Leia and Obi-Wan and Yoda and Vader.  This movie makes those all the more special as we see how everything goes full circle.All the critics can pick away at the little errors and continuity disputes between this series of three and the original three but I am happy.  I have closure and a better understanding of George Lucas' vision of the Star Wars saga.If for nothing else, see this movie for that.	5.0	got my money's worth	2005-06-05	16	10	6
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"George Lucas can fill up his blue screen with the end products of every computer at Industrial Light & Magic working day and night to keep up with his fertile imagination, but at its best moment ""Star Wars: Episode III, Revenge of the Sith"" still comes down to two actors whaling away at each other with glowing glass tubes.  When Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) finally cross their light sabers they show how far we have come from the ""first"" time we saw them fight on the Death Star a long time ago in that galaxy far, far away.When last we left our heroes, Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) had been revealed as a Sith Lord and Anakin had secretly wed Padm&eacute; (Natalie Portman).  All that is left is for him to join the Dark Side and for her to give birth to twins without daddy Darth knowing about it.  There are not a lot of real surprises in ""Revenge of the Sith."" We know going in that Obi-Wan and Anakin are going to walk and/or crawl away from their big fight.  Nothing could ever top the shattering revolution that Darth Vader was Luke's father and there is no attempt to try anything like that in this film.  Then again, everybody knew going into the biggest money making movie of all time that the unsinkable ship was going to go down, so it is not like surprise is necessary to evoke strong emotion from an audience.The most poignant moment in the film is when we finally see Luke and Leia, as all of the memories of what is to come in their future rushes to mind.  Otherwise, the biggest emotional impact comes when the Jedi are betrayed and start falling to the clone troopers.  But there are other moments that should have blown us away, and they did not.  Padm&eacute; should have at least one moment where we cry our eyes out at the end, but the motivation provided (by a droid no less) is completely lacking and really seemed like a convenient way of getting us quicker to the end of the movie.  The biggest flaw in this trilogy was the sudden transformation of Anakin from the sweet young kid in ""The Phantom Menace"" to the brooding and surly figure in ""Attack of the Clones.""  He was an angry young man before his mother dies a minute after he is finally reunited with her, which is just another example of how the execution does not match the idea.  There has to be a better reason for why Padm&eacute;, once Queen of Naboo and now a member of the Senate, falls for Anakin when he shows up still smitten a decade later and marries him in secret than the fact she has to bear his children so they can star in the other trilogy.The fault, dear padawan, lies not in the story, but in the screenplay.  On ""The Empire Strikes Back"" Lucas created the story but gave the screenwriting duties over to Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan, which could be the simplest explanation for why that film remains the best of the bunch.  I accept the idea of what makes Anakin choose the path to becoming Darth Vader, but the execution is not as powerful as it could be.  Consequently, when the payoff comes as Anakin dons the black mask for the first time I have to say it was not set up as well as it could have been.  The whole idea of Anakin as the ""Chosen One"" ultimately turns out to matter to no one other than Obi-Wan, when it should have been a key part of some grander irony regarding Anakin's fate.  The emotional impact of the story should be as significant a part of this film as the eye candy and because it was not I end up feeling compelled to round down.The two characters who come out the best in this movie are Yoda and R2-D2.  The Jedi master showed a little of what he could be when he took on Count Dooku at the climax of ""Attack of the Clones,"" and he pulls out all the stops this time.  Meanwhile, R2-D2 gets pretty much all of the limited number of laughs there are in this one.  McGregor tries to sound like a ""young"" Alec Guiness at times and Christensen definitely has the look down as the future Darth Vader.  Unfortunately Portman has little to do but look on helplessly as what happens starts happening, mainly because her character is pregnant.  It is Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine who ends up with the best acting moments in film because until the end he functions as the villain.The great leap forward in special effects was between the first ""Star Wars"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back."" I remember going back to see the original film one afternoon to watch it twice, focusing on the lower left hand part of the screen the first time and the lower right hand the second time just to catch all of the details.  Now Lucas has crammed so much onto the screen that it will be up to doctoral candidates and fans with nothing else in their lives to catalogue everything there is to see in this one.  ""Revenge of the Sith"" certainly hits the ground running with Obi-Wan and Anakin attempting a daring rescue in the middle of a giant space battle, and once Skywalker makes his fatal choice the action pretty much goes into high gear until the end.This is definitely a movie worthy seeing more than once and if the emotional impact is not as great as the computer-generated visuals it is not really surprising that the final ""Star Wars"" film does not live up to our expectations.  The irony, of course, is that George Lucas got us hooked because he of how far he exceeded them in the first place in the magic summer of 1977."	4.0	At long last Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader	2005-05-24	3	2	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2A08NPTUT1X3N	"Lawrence Wilson ""Cubdukat"""	"First, let's get the obvious  about ""Revenge of the Sith"" out of the way.Yes, George Lucas is completely clueless when it comes to writing dialogue.Yes, many of the scenes are so visually incredible that it almost seems as if they were made that way to distract you from the fact that George Lucas is completely clueless when it comes to writing dialogue.Yes, there is a great gap between the really good performances (Ewan McGregor, Samuel L. Jackson, Ian McDiarmid) and the true clunkers (Hayden Christiansen, Natalie Portman).Having said that, IMHO, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is what the two ""Star Wars"" movies that preceded it should have been. There's a certain maturity Lucas seems to have found as a director that was lacking in the other films. While he still seems more comfortable with the technology than the artistic aspects of directing, he's also shown great improvement in that area as well.All of the actors seem to have found their strides. One of the problems I had with ""Attack of the Clones"" was that I couldn't see how Anakin and Obi-Wan could ever have become friends. Here, I still don't know how they got there, but I can believe that they are. Ewan McGregor is in full Alec Guinness mode, and the only thing more enjoyable than seeing him onscreen is Ian McDiarmid's slow seduction of Anakin. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like Natalie Portman's Padme, it seemed to me that she was trying too hard to channel Carrie Fisher's Leia (even to the point of adopting the Cinnabon hairdo).All in all, if you haven't seen this movie, by all means do so.NOTE: Much of what has been said about ""Sith"" being somewhat graphic is true, but the only truly disturbing scene IMHO was Anakin's immolation and reconstruction as Darth Vader. I think that while it is unbearable to watch, Lucas wanted to illustrate how terrible Anakin's fall was and how it could happen to anybody--even someone close."	5.0	Only Now, At The End, Does He Understand...	2005-08-23	3	1	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2MK80I31FKB18	Leanne V. Barnes	"This 6th and last installment on the Star Wars franchise does redeem the last 2 prequels but a couple of short comings on this one, for one thing dialog-Anakin and Obi Wan are fighting and after Obi Wan severs Anakin's limbs and the best thing Anakin can say is-"" I Hate You""-wooo good comeback! He just lost his limbs and that's the best they can do! And how about at the end when he finds out Padme is dead. He yells out this-""NOOOOOOO"" that is so unbelievably lame and weak!! He's Darth Vader at this point, where's the rage and pain in his voice? That ""NOOOO"" sounds like his favorite NFL team just lost the Monday night game.Another different aspect that was not necessarily bad for the point of the story but bad for little kids was more violence in this PG-13 installment. Definitely, helped tell the story better, but showing those children or ""younglings"" as their referred to, killed was hard to swallow. Also, a burnt Anakin perhaps not so nice to look at but necessary to his tranformation to Vader.The mood is dark and it was needed to understand Anakin's transformation to the dark side. I guess what I'm trying to say is maybe wait before showing this to younger children. It's definitely a darker movie than the others.One thing I would have like to have seen is more passion between Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Padme (Natalie Portman). They were married in secret, I would of like to have seen more of a ""them against the world"" feel. The passion of their love for each other in their embrace and the way the kissed each other and talked to one other.Natalie and Hayden's on-screen chemistry was definitely better in this movie than Attack of the Clones, I just wanted to see more of them together in this movie to understand his passion and love for her as the reason why he goes to the Dark Side to save her from death in child birth (as he's been fearing) as the Chancellor Palpatine lies to him and tells him that will save her.Top marks for special effects as always. Ewan McGregor did a great job and I must say that female viewers will not be disappointed as Hayden Christensen is looking PRETTY GOOD in this movie all buffed out with a little longer hair. As for his acting still a bit wooden but his transformation to the dark side is believable.That's what redeems this movie, the transformation to the Dark Side, the way Anakin looks-those eyes, a burnt shell of a man by the end. George Lucas's journey comes full circle in tying up loose ends and making us understand the transformation."	4.0	Redeemable 3rd Pre-quel but.......	2005-12-12	5	3	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3G79IED8R8149	"Lee Munday ""Le Roy"""	"...don't push Star Wars! That's what I say to all those not-likers of the new trilogy.This film rocks like that BACKSTREET BOYS video!FILM:While some will forever debate whether a Spielberg or a Darabont or a chimpanzee with a lap-top could have done a better directing job, those like myself who embraced MENACE and CLONES and are forgiving of JEDI will agree that memorable characters, engaging performances and a good script do not necessarily make for a movie you want to see.How does ROTS fit into the grand scheme of the Star Wars universe? To paraphrase the immortal Darth Vader, NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!.Sure it's not as good as EMPIRE but how could it ever be? For SITH to work half as well you would need memorable characters and engaging performances. Or a good script at least. Cut Lucas a break! This movie is held up by 2005's state of the art visual effects. Let's not forget that.Lucas has once again wisely concentrated on giving us X-box generation, fanboys what we really want. War! Yes from the first word (and exclamation mark!) of the opening crawl we know where this movie is heading.The Outer Rim territories, where Obi Wan has to pull out Anakin so they can help Palpatine who is stuck in a chair.Some fans bitched that reducing Darth Maul to a cameo part and a pair of trousers in MENACE ruined the chance of the greatest lightsaber duel in Star Wars history with a Maul/Vader face off. But when you've got a sulking punk cutting off an octogenarian Dracula's head CGd onto a twenty year old stuntman's body instead, who cares?! I certainly didn't.Lucas obviously realised his mistake with the Endor battle in JEDI (Teddy bears on bamboo gliders bringing down the Empire? Come on). Wookiees in wood helicopters, that's how you make amends.I for one was thrilled at having the mighty Chewbacca back and standing around in the midst of the action. Lucas very cleverly shoe-horned him into this instalment with a much more artificial appearance, in keeping with the overall look of his new trilogy (much less formidable, girls and A.L.F. fans will be pleased to hear. No problem!).I chuckled to the thirty-something guy next to me that apparently the TARZAN call is now the official Wookiee war cry. Only to be done when entering battle swinging on a rope (just as funny as in JEDI). He informed me that for all the good Chewbacca did in it he could p*ss up one too but I don't know how he would know that.As torturous as it is to watch you can understand Anakin's turn to the dark side. Like Othello with lasers the tragedy was delivered with spades. His anger against the Jedi council grows when they won't tell him when they're going out and make him stay at home with the robots. As if this isn't bad enough he also bears the terrible burden of his wife's impending death leaving him with the kids. He's barely had a childhood himself, what with the death of his mother and that disease that makes you grow up too fast like Ralph Machio (he was forty six when he made KARATE KID III and you could see he was wearing a nappy under his jeans). It's no wonder he turned.In a scene more moving than any of Mr Miyagi's crying ones in THE KARATE KIDS, Padme relays her love and worst fears to Anakin wearing a 1930's leather American Rugby helmet to the sound of someone urinating in a bowl. This moved me not least because I had managed to see off a 2 litre bottle of White Lightning waiting for the space ships to finish at the beginning.Samuel L. Jackson falls out of a window.Another scene that carried a profound emotional punch was Palpatine ordering the execution of Order 69. I was a little disappointed we never see Order 69 (a blackmail droid maybe?) or find out why Palpatine wants him executed but a sh*t-load of Jedis dressed like fairground pikeys get it in the meantime and I f***ing hate pikeys.But kiddies beware. This movie is PG to the extreme! In the movies darkest moment, (how much darker could it be? The answer is none more dark!) Anakin takes out a room full of those Jedi children Lucas put in for the chicks (yipee!). This obviously transpires off screen which is a shame as it would have been riveting to watch them attempt to defend themselves using the finely honed skills and prowess displayed in their rigorous training regime during CLONES.This leads me to what is probably SITH'S greatest spectacle and esoteric moment: Anakin's savage duel with his friend and mentor, Obi Wan on a crumbling planet of liquid fire.Like Anakin, I lost my mother to a desert living race when she ran off with a camel driver on a cycling holiday to Egypt so I know how it feels to want to kill someone with a moustache.C3-PO was hilarious.My father teaches English Literature and P.E. and has a moustache. So when people ask me if the dialogue was any less embarrassing in this one I always give the same answer: honestly, it was like my dad wrote it. It was at that level (G.C.S.E.). You could really feel Ewan Macgregors pain in having to say lines like ""He killed many younglings"".The long awaited `birth' of Vader was full on tragic. At the news of his wife's death, Hayden Christensen brilliantly captures the spirit of Peter Boyle's monster from YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, clumsily kicking loose from his shackles with his arms outstretched. He nailed that Boyle walk man. F***ing awesome!I know the bellowing of NOOOOOO!!! after the death of a loved one has been done a thousand times and parodied in movies like TEAM AMERICA but here a straight faced Lucas presents Darth Vader doing it as if it had never been done before. And the audience was all the more open mouthed for it. I kid you not, the thirty-something guy next to me had tears rolling down his cheeks.Now while some would argue that it would have been just as easy, if not better and perhaps more logical and less annoying to make Anakin an adult from the start and have him become Vader earlier in the plot, this wouldn't really be true to the Star Wars mythos. The story had to be about innocence lost through actions taken while hitting your twenties faster than a girl already more than twice your age at 7.I for one feel that Mr. Christensen really could not have brought anymore to this role. That takes some kind of talent. I can't wait to see him on TV. We empathised with the dark lord in his new form and in Christensen felt Anakin's awkwardness in trying to fill a costume clearly meant for a 300lb stunt man.To all those who whined that the new trilogy was too clean and the technology more advanced compared to the original, this is what happens over 19 years of dictatorial rule. Things, especially art or culture, regress. Think the Stalin/Communist era in Russia. Or ALLY McBEAL season five.Hardcore fans of the original trilogy may have a little trouble loving the new because as I think Steven Spielberg once said when comparing the two trilogies; you can only be a virgin once. There was no way the new trilogy could ever surpass a first love.Luckily I am still a virgin because my first love turned out to be a twelve year old bloke who regularly left the light on while doing the GET IN SHAPE GIRL Bangle Bop with his bedroom curtains open. I loved it.REVENGE OF THE SITH effectively adds to the whole Star Wars DVD collection. It not only goes after episodes I and II; it adds a III before IV,V and VI as well. And CARAVAN OF COURAGE. Quite an accomplishment considering there are five ROCKYS in the ROCKY DVD collection and they've had ages to make those.Hopefully the TV series will answer some tantalising questions raised by the new trilogy (and some still as yet unanswered from the original). Like how Darth Vader has no f***ing recollection of the two droids he worked with directly for almost twenty years, (one of whom he built)? Why Obi Wan Kenobi can't remember them either, why he made up that bullsh*t story about Yoda training him and how he reaches the age of 65 in forty eight years? How Leia was able to remember her mother being sad in the thirty seconds she was out of the uterus? Why Jedis don't disappear when they die anymore? Why R2-D2 didn't just fly out of that swamp and why in scouring the galaxy for his son, Vader didn't think to look in his brothers house, down the road from his best mate? On his home planet.It's just too bad that this is the final movie instalment.

It wasn't perfect by any means, but there was just so much that needed to be done to set up the original trilogy.George Lucas focused on some very interesting issues. On occasion you even find yourself being seduced by the dark side. The acting was generally very good, and the action with the lightsaber duels went as far as they should go. The duel between Obi Wan and Anakin brings them both to a virtual standstill.The slowness in places should warrant 4 stars only, but I've chosen to accept it as a story necessity.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AYW3H5NJ56EYW	~LEON~	"What can I say? I would gladly go and write a 1 star review for Episode 1 right now - if indeed I felt it was worth wasting the time on; and despite seeing it twice at the cinema I cannot for the life of me even remember what happened in Episode 2, such was its non effect on me. I bought Episode 3 just because. Just for the sake of having seen all the Star Wars films. It sat on my telly for a week before I bothered playing it, and when I finally got around to it it was more for the sake of being able to totally and utterly rubbish it and feel exalted for being an ""original trilogy"" purist who could retreat into the timeless myth of the first films and turn my back on the all singing, all dancing, all Jar Jar Binks, people walking through their poorly scripted roles, look at the pretty special FX, ""let's ruin all the mystery with crap characters and stories"" modern films.After all that, Epsisode 3 was a truly worthy stepping stone that thoroughly impressed me and made me wonder if ol' Georgey boy hadn't been stringing us along with all that ""do it for the kids"" crap all along.The Emperor (is he the same actor?) is flawless, and captures the Emperor perfectly. Ewan McGregor is either better, or exactly the same but being made to look better by a far superior film around him. Yoda is actually mildly interesting, although nowhere near the league of genuine spiritual insight he occupied in the original trilogy, and even Anakin does a reasonable job. Even Jar Jar Binks does us all an unreturnable favour by not showing up til the last five minutes and then only for a few seconds in a non-speaking role.Although the whole transition is a little too hurried and simple to be perfect, it is superbly done, and for the sake of a two hour(ish) film it worked very well. Episode 3 got dark enough to convince. Anakin really was left in a horrible mess by Obi Wan, and was already in a reasonbably convincing turmoil. He really did hit rock bottom in all respects and this absolutely had to happen if Lucas was to convince me that a nice-boy like Haydn Christensen could ever evolve into the baddest movie villain ever. His rebirth as Darth Vader, breathing support and all, was an excellent piece of film-making. A standout scene involves Anakin waking up to the reality of life trapped inside the Vader suit, a living hell thrust upon him in almost the blink of an eye, while the truly evil Emperor looks on smiling, pleased that he has put Anakin exactly where he wants him and knows that there he shall remain.It's really quite deep stuff that genuinely ties in with the original trilogy. There is still 20 years of imagination until we see Vader board the Princess' ship in the first few minutes of Episode iv, so it could never kill all the mystery.At the end of the movie when Vader steps up and takes his place beside Palpatine on the Star Destroyer Deck looking out into space, I for one - an original trilogy purist who detested Episodes 1 & 2 & who hails 4, 5 & 6 as the best films ever - felt a real sense of being priveliged to see film history in the making, and the unfolding of part of a myth that has been with me since childhood and that has not had any light shed on it in 20 + years. The same with the handing over of a young Luke to his uncle on Tattoine, it cultivates a real sense of everything being set up for the start of Episode iv.It's hard to explain but it had a real effect on me, which I didn't expect.One of the few films that I want to see for the first time all over again.Worthy of the original trilogy, George Lucas has redeemed himself."	5.0	Redemption	2005-11-07	8	5	3

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1U6B2LDK3BUVU	"LF ""Keep your feedback to yourself, these are..."	Revenge of the Sith is for children and for adults with the minds of children.  To a grownup, this movie is moronic and boring.The only good part of the movie is the very end when we see the birth of Princess Leia and her twin brother Luke Skywalker, and they are placed in foster homes because their mom is dead and their dad is the enemy.  The babies are cute, and you really can't lose by showing newborn babies.Aside from that, this movie is horrible.  The fight scenes are worse than kung fu flicks with idiots hopping around like bunnies.  The acting, particularly that of Anakin Skywalker, is really juvenile and pathetic.  The writing is worst of all.  The writing really deserves to be punished.  The screenwriter deserves a good whipping for this garbage.Anakin and Obiwan Kenobi are in another stupid fight, when suddenly Obiwan lands on higher ground and tells Anakin to give it up because it is hopeless since he is on higher ground.  Hahahaha.  What idiot thought of that?  They just needed an excuse to have Obiwan win the fight, so they made up that nonsense.  Does the public really buy that?  How many times in this same movie do people jump around from lower to higher ground and vice versa?  Oh my god is this a STUPID film.I knew it was going to be utterly stupid very early on, when the two jedi were about to enter an air battle in their planes, and one of them put a smile on his face and said This is where the fun starts.  In other words, as we well know, there is absolutely no doubt who will win, because at this stage of the movie the good guys win, and there isn't even any tension in a battle, it's just a ballgame.  Remove all realism from the script, why don't you.Another utterly stupid bit of writing, considering that this silly flick is targeted for children, is to have the only female in the cast die in childbirth.  Great.  Take your young daughters to see it.  They will have this to identify with and remember the rest of their lives.  When your target audience is young children, as the target is for this film because anyone who is not a baby will see how moronic it is, why do you want to scare the Bejesus out of the little girls in the theatre regarding having children of their own?It's a shame that instead of being punished for this garbage, the people responsible for this movie actually got paid for it.	1.0	Moronic and boring to all except children	2006-07-21	21	13	8

I've come to believe George Lucas can't write or cast very well, so he inundates us with special effects and CG sets and landscapes (notice how obsessed he is with big spaces and sweeping panoramas?), along with endless scenes of light saber duels in hopes we won't notice how awful the dialog is and how little character development there is. My daughter told me that when she went to see Revenge of the Sith, during one of Hayden Christensen's pitiful attempts to sound romantic someone yelled out, ""Stop talking!"" I can understand why. I've never seen anyone less capable of conveying romantic emotion, not that the lines they gave him helped. One question this movie definitely did not answer was why someone as wonderful as Padme would fall for such an arrogant loser. Another unanswered question: if Anakin is so strong with the Force, why is he so easily duped by the dark lord and so blind to the sincerity of the Jedi council? No matter how you look at it, Anakin was an idiot. A dupe. A complete fool. Oh, and a third question that came to me during the movie was who in his right mind would put that suit on someone while his flesh was still oozing from having his skin burned off? Someone needs to sit George Lucas down and explain to him that good writing and casting are not luxuries you can justify foregoing just because you have the best special effects house working for you."	2.0	Another disappointment	2005-08-03	34	13	21

He was the gut force of this movie.  Noone can deny that his duel role was outstanding.  If his acting was weak, this character would not have been believable and the movie would not have worked, period.  A good thing for this though, is how the actors grew into these roles from the beginning to the end of Star Wars III.  We see this as we did with Star Wars IV-VI.  Going back to Star Wars I and II, I can appreciate the acting a tad bit better.  Even Christiansen and Portman grew into these roles, along with Ewen McGregor.  If McDirmand is overlooked for nomination, this is a shame.  And overall, the production of Star Wars deserve all the major awards upcoming.

Most probably will agree that the films got progressively better. In terms of special effects and fight scenes Revenge was truly entertaining. There were some exciting one on one fight scenes throughout the film. Unfortunately the storyline was somewhat disappointing. Anakin's conversion to the dark side was not very compelling. The way in which the Jedi were wiped out was too easy. So while the story flowed and tied things up, it was not very believable. Despite these weaknesses in the plot, I still enjoyed the film. Also, the DVD is packed with the usual extras (commentary, deleted scenes, etc.). The extras alone are worth watching.	4.0	Best of the 3 Prequel Films...	2005-12-03	2	1	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A15QEL4CCV4QQY	Locke	As trilogies go, Star Wars has generated the most public outpouring of opinion. Gone are the days when people sit patiently and await the arrival of a new film with quiet expectancy. Yes, we are all eager and, yes, we are all anxious to see one of the most conversely demonised and revered characters of the big screen turn from bright young jedi to the all-powerful Darth Vader: the point is, that posting reviews and opinions based on the vaguest of 'facts' is futile. Lucasfilm reserves the right to release and retain images so that our expectancy is based on 'drip' psychology. We see what Lucas wants us to see, and, I for one, agree that this is best way to generate interest. If the film lives up to the director's expectations, then we should all be satified with the end result - it is his vision alone that we are speculating upon and tearing apart.As a personal opinion, I liked the two, thus far, prequels: they answered a lot of questions, brightened the mythos surrounding the saga and left me wanting more. Is that not what sagas are about? Whether we agree with George Lucas's vision is irrelevant. I will be one of the dedicated fans jostling to find a ticket for May 19, 2005 and I will enjoy watching the vision of a diligent man come to fruition.	4.0	Vaders of the Lost Art	2004-10-06	24	16	8

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AA8XW00JA2915	Lord_of_the_Sith	It amazes me on a daily basis that fans of the original trilogy could possibly be fans of the new tragedy(trilogy). When are people going to wake up and realize that you can dump as much special effects into any poorly developed movie and it will still be a bad movie. The original trilogy was strong on so many elements including a good script/plot, groundbreaking special effects, and most importantly a cast that clearly illustrated that they had a very special chemistry which enhanced the overall story.While the new series has great special effects, the script is mediocre at best and most of the characters brought a lackluster performance, with very little chemistry. A couple nice lightsaber scenes and battle sequences hardly make-up for the obvious oversight when it comes to character and story development. I'm all up for action packed sequences in the overall development of a good story, BUT the story drives the quality of the movie, not the FX.  Ultimately the fact that opinions vary widely on the quality of the new movies from the fan base itself, reflect that these movies are lacking. With the original movies almost everyone agreed that films rocked (albeit ROTJ had some controversy over the Ewoks). It may be unfair to compare the two trilogies since the new films have so much to measure up to, but life is not fair. I guess the old school fans can complain until they are blue in the face, but for those of us who want to recapture the emotions that the original movies evoked, we are going to have to watch the original movies over and over again.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AG5K5RASCP4PT	"L. sherman ""dragonfrost0131"""	"Given that I finished the novelization and actually know what takes place in the third film, I have to say that it should redeem a lot of the fans' faiths in Lucas' storytelling.  While the atmosphere is thoroughly depressing, right from the first scene, it definitely delves into more serious ground, with several anticipated lightsaber battles, all of which are incredible in scope.  Without ruining it for anyone, according to the novel, there are some subtle ""Luke, I am your father"" moments, although it does force you to put some of the loose pieces together to figure out the connections.  After giving way to the temptation of ruining the plot before the movie actually comes out in a month, the book is written in a way in which I'm still very eccentric about going to see it opening night.  For starters, the book almost has no mention of Wookies, and some dialogue that was included in the TV spots were absent from the pages of the book, so I have a feeling a lot of details were left out.For those skeptical about film three, I really think this one will win your hearts over.  Then again, I tend to get hostile to the hypocritcal views given to Episodes I and II.  I think those were as good as the Star Wars films get.  Sure, they are flawed, but I don't understand why everyone thinks they're supposed to be Oscar winners.  None of the Star Wars films are drop-dead phenomenal, other than the visuals...they just work great as a whole.  There are plenty of movies that have much more depth than Star Wars -- Gladiator, The Lord of the Rings, and The Godfather, to name a few.  To say that the prequels don't live up the 80s trilogy is to be bias upon the decade you grew up in.  While some of the dialogue was flat, and the characters weren't completely developed, there's more to a movie than characters and dialogue; the storytelling is phenominal, in all the films.  People say that the podrace made no sense...how can you say that?  Were you people not paying attention?  What's not to get?  Anakin needed to win the race so that he could be freed.  It's very simple, in my opinion.  It's just basic storytelling, put in a space setting.  Then there was the love story between Padm&eacute; and Anakin.  Yes, the dialogue was corny, and there was a lack of chemistry between the two...but it's a typical Star Wars love story.  Some people actually do talk like that when they're in love.  They won't admit to it, but I think it's a possibility.I didn't grow up watching Star Wars.  I got into the trilogy in the mid-90s, so I look at the films objectively.  They're the only movies that make me feel like a kid again.  Just watching a crowd of people buy boxes of action figures is amazingly fascinating.  But sometimes I look at them and say, ""Why do you do this to yourselves?  You know you're just going to hate this movie, too.  Go home.""I'm a fan in that, I love the great storytelling and the characters that go along with the excitement of waiting in line for hours to be the first to see the flick...and then do it again four more times in the same week.  I don't have a mass of toys, but I do have a modest collection of books, and about four copies of each film, from the original VHS releases to the updated DVDs.  But I like all the films the same.  If people watched the films as if they were movies, and not life-changing situations, maybe you'd feel like the Force was with you when you smacked down your $8.50."	4.0	A disturbance in the Force...	2005-04-09	15	8	7
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2SGR7LE899LGG	Luigi	Finally a decent prequel to the original trilogy. Excellent action and FX. The plot is dynamic and for the first time there are actual emotions shown among the characters. Anakin does a great job at his role and I even got emotionally involved, at some point, for the first time since I saw the first two movies. Of course the film is not perfect and some of the dialogue (love scenes) is childish and simplistic at best. Toward the end we see many familiar faces as well as spaceships (including the interiors) which works to connect this movie to the old trilogy. One thing at the end left me confused however; we see Dart Vader looking at the construction of the death star and we also see the rebel blockade runner ship, it seems like episode 4 should start exactly where this one ends, however let's not forget that Luke Skywalker as well as princess Leia are in their early 20s when episode 4 starts; Did the death star take 20 years to be built? and the rebel blockade runner ship was around for that long?

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1QFN4O70XUAB1	"Lukas D. ""Lukas D."""	"This movie is a prime example of hyperbole and mass hysteria gone amok. This is not a 5 star film. This is not a 4 star film. This is a 2 star (at best) film. 4 or 5 stars would denote a cinema classic. An extraordinarly well written film, (generally) with a cogent plot and natural necessary dialogue where the actors and actresses aren't acting, but are inhabiting their characters.This is just a 2.5 hour commercial, full of flashy effects, stilted acting, and a plot so ridiculous and contradictory (especially to the Original Trilogy) that it defies description. And for the record, I love the Original Trilogy. The Empire Strikes Back stands the test of time one of the greatest films ever made, but not because of George Lucas. (From what I've read,the producer, Gary Kurtz, made many of the dark changes to that film).So what's wrong with the film? The first is the pure mediocrity that overshadows what could have been rousing and emotional. Part of the problem lies in the set up of Anakin's character. George Lucas has given us no reason to care about Anakin's fate. And because of this, the turn to the dark side is rushed and practically comes out of nowhere (yes i know about the Padme dream, but the whole thing doesn't make any sense, because you don't join up with the group that has a reputation for evil and murder to save someone's life). Instead, Anakin slices off another jedi's hand and sends Samuel Jackson (who is completely wasted and is evidence that George Lucas has really no interest in directing, anymore) out a window in the second worst acted scene in the movie. (The Vader NOOOOOO! has to be the single most cringe worthy scene in ""A"" movie history.)But it's pretty, and people want to love it because it's likely the last Star Wars movie they're going to see. And that's a shame that such lavish praise can be heaped on something so mediocre. If you like flashing lights and multiple explosions, then you'll probably love this. But a real cinephile will be highly disappointed, especially in the knowledge of how good and powerful this (and the entire prequel series) could have been."	2.0	5 Stars?

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX	magellan	This is the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back. The three earlier prequels, although okay, just weren't in the same league as the original series (but then what is?), especially the first and second films in the original trilogy. But the Revenge of the Sith is dramatically better with great special effects, a much stronger story line, awesome battle scenes, and Yoda is just plain the baddest dude in 10 galaxies. A nice touch, although all too brief, is that the Wookies have their own battle scene on their own planet. The planetary scenes and visuals are really striking, especially the outer planets system (don't recall the name, but it was the one with the pterodactyl-like creatures), and the volcanic world, which were just very cool, or hot, as the case may be.I only had two minor compaints, which are that I would have liked to see Count Dooku stick around longer and I would have given general Grievous shorter shrift, as Christopher Lee is just a class act, but he died a bit too soon, and General Grievous stuck around too long. Also the fight between Count Dooku and Anakin made the final one between Kenobi and Darth almost anticlimactic, but still, overall a fine flick and definitely worth seeing on the big screen.	5.0	A brief comment	2005-05-21	1	0	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3NM0RAYSL6PA8	"Maine Writer ""David"""	"... but signifying nothing?  Well, not quite.  ""Nothing"" -- or a little bit less than nothing -- adequately describes The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.  Revenge of the Sith is slightly more than nothing, with considerable emphasis on slightly.  It actually has a marginally engaging story.  If you can make it through the tedious, effects-laden first hour, and the two young leads who can't appear to act their way out of a paper bag (could it be the horrible dialogue and one-note facial expressions?), you might actually find just enough plot to make you a little bit curious about how things will turn out.  Sadly, however, if you do, you're likely to regret it.  The ending of Sith is as laughable as it is implausible, unintentionally playing like a combination of Monty Python, a Lifetime movie, and Spaceballs.The core of Sith is the looming question of how a self-centered, narcissistic teenager with seemingly no intellectual or emotional depth (and this moronic , brooding expression he can't seem to wipe off his face) becomes the evil Darth Vader (a guy whose day job includes wiping out entire planets).  There are several ""answers"" that George Lucas offers, none of which are either satisfying or especially plausible.  Does young Anakin become Darth because he wants to save the life of a young wife towards whom he seems to project little interest, let alone passion? Does he become Darth because of a naked lust for power which seems to earn him little more than he already has?  Is it because he wants to be called Master (although he ends up settling for Lord, which, I suppose, has its own pleasures)?  Or is it because he makes this ""mean"" face all the time?Overall, Sith suffers from an embarrassment of ""riches"" ... too much money thrown at too many things that matter too little.  Too much visual ""wizardry,"" so much so that it is monotonous, distracting, and, ultimately, irritating; too much kiddie ""humor"" at just the ""right"" times (and not enough genuine humor and playfulness); too much speech-making, though, thankfully, not as much as its two immediate predecessors.  Too many interminable and repetitive fight scenes.  And, remarkably, most of the special effects are unconvincing.  From a fake-looking Yoda to these rubbery digital ""characters"" leaping and flipping in silly fight sequences, somebody needs to tell George Lucas that he's getting ripped off.Overall, Sith has the feel of ""pretend playing"" by a geeky twelve-year old.  The dialogue is completely awkward and without the slightest bit of subtlety.  And over all of this hangs this absurd and entirely silly sense of its own seriousness that reflects a puerile idea of what must feel like to be an ""adult."""	2.0	Full of sound, fury, special effects, and really bad acting	2005-05-28	79	30	49

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1IANEBSMVGHS9	"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny"""	All those who grew up to the first trilogy back in the eighties were finally able to see things come full circle with Episode III. Darth Vader almost literally rises from the ashes where Anakin is left, and the Skywalker twins are born and split shortly thereafter. No surprise in any of that, since we've known that for over twenty years now. The interesting thing about the movie is how is all this done.After what most moviegoers (fans above all) felt like two flops in Episodes I and II, Lucas came back with an Episode III with the tall order of tying all the ends, ensuring continuity and telling the darkest story of all six Episodes in an appealing way, where the effects don't take the first row over the tale. I have to say that the mission was accomplished.The visuals continue to show off all the technical prowess that have made him a Hollywood legend, but in spite of the abundance of CG elements, they seamlessly blend in with the action. Also, for the first time since the first trilogy, the dialogs are beyond cheesy and shallow. They are packed with emotions and the acting in most cases helped deliver the characters' feelings right through to you.My only criticism would be about the editing. There is too much ground to cover in too little time, and there were two or three places where it felt as if the scene was cut short out a need to save time, not letting a particular part of the story become fully developed. Other than this, I left the theater feeling like a happy Star Wars fan again. All the buzz and the hype was right on!	5.0	One happy Star Wars fan writes after leaving the theater	2005-05-22	5	2	3

I heard George Lucas mention that it was about one man's journey -- the journey of Anakin Skywalker.I will agree that some of the acting was stiff but looking back, there was stiff acting in all six movies -- with a few exceptions -- and....Episode I was my least favorite. You have to admit that after seeing them all, when you get to Episode III, you are hoping (in spite of knowing the outcome) with all your heart that Anakin doesn't go down the dark path. That, I believe, was Lucas' mission and he achieved it.I couldn't help thinking that we all have the same ""good vs. evil"" war going on within us daily and that we all have the same choice to give in or to fight. I mean....Didn't you gasp in horror when Vader told Luke he was his father? Didn't you understand Luke's desire to ""turn him to the good side"" because he felt that ""there (is) still good in him""? Why would Luke even care about that?After seeing all six movies, I now love the saga even more than I did in the beginning.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1B05INWIDZ74O	M. A. Ramos	After seeing the last two Star Wars released...I did not go to the theater to see this. I waited for the DVD. I was wrong. Mr. Lucas finally got his formally back and this movie was great. He revisits the basic premises of good versus evil. And the reprise of the original Star Wars music was well done.This film starts off right, reminiscent of the first release. A large spaceship sitting quietly in a star system, lit up by a large star. Then it cuts to Obi-Wan and Anakin Skywalker flying very small ships fly by the ship. Next thing we know, we watch the two of them leading a strike into what looks like a large battle. Where our two Jedi save the Chancellor.Of course our space opera gets back into focus with the characters. The Jedi council wants to end the war and give the power back into the hands of the Senate I they know this requires for General Grievious and Count Dooku to be taken care of. Which are two of the big and well-done fight scenes. These two great fights only pale in comparison to the light saber duel between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan.We have Anakin still in love with Padme. And Padme is no with child. Hayden does a good job of playing an emotionally immature yet very ambitious boy. Which is the antithesis to what everything a Jedi stands for. So it surprises me when Obi-wan does not seem to want to keep more control over him. Yet he does not fool the council. And his friction with the Jedi Council increases when the Chancellor takes him under his wing.Ian McDiarmid does an excellent job playing the Chancellor throughout the entire movie. Natalie Portman has very little scenes. All in all it is a top rate cinematic experience and I would suggest buying the DVD.	5.0	Finally back on track.	2005-11-04	10	5	5

And now at this century in which the special effects for programming and developping are growing and growing, is not convenient being comparing between ""SW"", ""The empire strikes back"" and ""Return of the Yedi"" (or is necesary call them Episodes IV, V and VI???) and the recently filmed episodes.This Episode III is better than I and II, but is the lost link between the original ""SW"", so with all the succesful of this ""SW"" was so much necessary the creation of a ""Entire Story"" since the beggining to the ending, but there'll be an ending? Maybe will be necessary let to the whole world see what happened with the twins (Leia and Luke), the Jedi preparing of Ben Kenobi, the Yoda's retire, the historic encounter between Cheewie and Han Solo beeing space partners, the malicious Vader and the searching for his kids and a lot of stuff to imagine for (a kind of ""Intermission"" movie).And the producers must search some similar in the teen-aged days as looks-alikes for Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill to the growing kids, or for Sir Alec Guiness to Ben Kenobi more younger than he was, or the same for Harrison Ford (with less deep voice range or similar he have now), but don't forget this: the Force made the first one ""SW"" and the force makes a success for all the trilogy with this ""Episode III"" including, what could happened if Anakin won Obi-Wan in the Yedi fighting at the end as it can be seen digitally in the ""PlayStation 2"" game?Just think about and change your Cinema Channel, in the Galaxy Orden everything can be happen and only GOD knows (for this trilogy George, maybe you too)."	5.0	The lost link but just faster to live for.	2005-09-29	7	5	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3FC4LJ4UQBGY1	Mark A. Bowles	"I, for one, was very pleased with this one. Not only because it was dark and had a faster pace than I or II, but because we FINALLY got a chance to see the relationship between Obiwan and Anakin. However it WAS rushed...In my opinion Episode I should have been about Obiwan discovering Anakin (as a teen)and the opening of the Clone Wars, Episode II should have involved the Clone Wars themselves, and finally this one should have been a less rushed version of itself. Over the course of the three we would have seen our two Jedi friends develop a friendship that would SLOWLY be erroded by Anakin's anger issues, hunger for power and acknowlegement, and of course his hottie senator girlfriend. We also could have gotten to know the clones better and it would have been nice to see one or two of them resist their programming.Instead, we got nearly all of the above shoved tightly into the last twenty minutes of Episode II and then Episode III. I agree, the Gungans and Qui-Gon were not required at all and wasted alot of precious screen time. The wookies would have been great in one of the first two films and their plight should have received more attention.That said, ROTS does indeed bring back some of the original trilogy flavor. Anyone who tells you different is just too upset over the first two to see it. There is a moment where Obiwan drops down in the middle of the Separatist army and quip's ""Hello there!"" as if he has bumped into an old friend at the mall. It is spot-on perfect. Even the droids have character in this movie, and Grievous is a hoot (moohahahah, cough cough cough).My only outstanding complaint (not related to the rushing)is Vader's awakening scene, very lame.As to all so called loose threads:--Obiwan does not acknowledge R2 in EPIV because, well because he is a big fat liar you dorks. He lied about Vader too, not to mention his own name. He would lie to his own mother if he had one. Plus he could care less about droids.--Vader does not acknowlege the droids because, well when the heck does he interrogate the droids? Besides, he slaughtered dozens of friends and elders. He doesn't strike me as sentimental at that stage in his life.--R2 does not mention the whole sordid mess because he is a reliable droid. Dude it's R2, he's Da Man!!--Leia remembers her mom because...well because she does. Some kids claim to remember their infancy and even prior life experiences. It happens. Luke doesn't, big surprise--not!--Midi-chlorians are a key issue, did some of you fall asleep? Plalpy all but declares in writing that he CREATED Anakin artificially!!! He left him as a slave to make him ANGRY!!--Qui-gon does not appear as a spirit because there was no space in this movie (see above) and we do not meet Obiwan again until he rescues Luke, who would not know Qui-gon from jack squat. Prior to Qui-gon figuring it out, nobody comes back.--Padme knows what names to use because.., oh for crying out loud have you never had kids!? Everybody labors over that issue when they are expecting. And everyone with a clue knows that you have to have a name for either gender...just in case.--Padme gives up and dies because she can't keep the babies or they will be toast for sure. And her hubby is Vader. What is her reason for living?You will hear/read alot of silly questions like these. But generally they are from people who have not bothered to find the obvious answers. This story has drawn out over 30 years and is bound to have holes anyway. Lucas has stated that he never really intended to finish the first half. But now that he has, others can start playing around with the side stories and perhaps finally please those who are not happy with the direction he went.Relax and enjoy this one. Then go beat each other senseless with your lightsabres!!"	4.0	Star Wars - Episode III, Revenge of the Sith	2005-06-13	7	3	4
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AJ9HH6SJQOROS	Mark Carneker	Easily the best of the prequel trilogy (not that that says much), but stellar performances by Ewan McGreggor and Ian McDirmond (whose name I probably spelled wrong) pump some life into the film and get us caring about the characters again. Special effects are great, but we've come to expect that from this series. This movie has a familiar style of semi-cheesy dialouge that we all know and love from the original trilogy, but mixed with much darker tones that make it a little more human than the others. All in all, expect to look at Darth Vader much differently after seeing Revenge of the Sith.	5.0	Best of the PT, up to par with OT	2005-10-09	5	3	2

If nothing else it will complete the circle and, in doing so, add a great deal of depth to Episodes 4 to 6.

Darker than the last two it stuck closer to the original films.  Unfortunately, I could never understand why the Queen would ever want such a whiney, sniverling, little boy such as Anakin.  Also, they forced the plot by getting Anakin to turn so quickly and to believe evil so fast.  He never doubted the Senator, and never approached anyone for guidance (Yoda, Obi-wan, etc.) for help with his feelings or understanding what was happening.  He turned way to fast and didnt think twice about murdering everyone that he did in the temple.  It lost stars for those weaknesses.	3.0	Better than the last two released films	2005-11-19	3	1	2

Then I saw it again on DVD I still didn't like it, but it is not the worst of the series. Shows the decline and fall of a republic into an empire-- a rip off of Asimov's Foundation series, and the temptation and corruption of a virtuous warrior. Yet this temptation came too easily and doesn't come across convincingly in this film. The script is superficial and not thought out deeply enough. It would have better that Skywalker died on the lava planet--and how did he know to go there? Perhaps I missed something. It melodrama of a purple prose level, Skywalker seems to die as his love of his life dies giving childbirth. One would think in such an age, no woman would die in childbirth, so that part I had trouble believing. I probably overrated this.	4.0	Dark violent entry to Star Wars saga	2014-02-23	1	0	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3BSB5TQ0AJQ7N	Mark Lunney	If you want an enjoyable sci-fi flick with little characterization and a bottom-level plot then this is worth a look. It's a lot better than the first two prequels, but mainly only because of some greater and more epic action sequences. There are some 'plot twists', but any fan will already know exactly what to expect, so it won't leave anyone surprised. That said, it is nice to see how everything comes together, which it does so quiet well if not perfectly.It's fair to say that this film is nothing compared to the original films, wheras they left you caring about the characters and enjoying every minute, this leaves you just enjoying the spectacular and over-CGI effects. For anyone who wants a film more like the orignal trilogy, you'll find it in the recently released Serenity by Joss Whedon. If it wasn't for the backbone of the originals, this would be forgotten in a decade.	3.0	Enjoyable but nothing special	2005-10-09	11	2	9
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1EXS156IQG7OA	Mark R. Whittington	"Star Wars was without a doubt the most fun many people had for a couple of hours in the dark back in 1977, with its grand adventure of a motley crew of rebels taking on the evil Darth Vader and the Empire among the stars. The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi were worthy sequals.Alas, the three ""prequal"" films, which includes now Revenge of the Sith, are a shadow of the other films. While Revenge of the Sith is a bit better than the other two of the modern films, it lacks a couple of things. Heart and believability.Revenge has action to burn, with eye popping special effects. But the story is just unbelievable. The motives for Anakin finally embracing the Dark Side are, to say the least, uncredible. The the idea that the Jedi, including Obi Wan, could not see it coming is even more uncredible. The viewer could see for a long time that Anakin was doing things that a Jedi (or even an ethical human being) just would not do. But we are expected to believe that super warrior beings could not.Then too, during the final battle on the lava planet, I lost all respect for Obi Wan, little as it had been. What he does to Anakin, letting him in effect cook in the lava and not giving him a proper coup de grace, actually made me feel sorry for the monster that we being made."	3.0	A Sad Finish to the Once Iconic Series	2005-12-20	8	5	3

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AXLXU4LMIRO3F	MartialWay	"Once again I wish to give a film three and a half stars, and Amazon only allows three or four! Actually they should do that with the Star Wars films. ""Revenge of the Sith"", ""A New Hope"", ""Empire Strikes Back"", and ""Return of the Jedi"" should be the only ones allowed to see the light of day. So it's three movies or four and those four films will complete my Star Wars collection. I'm going to pretend that ""Phantom Menace"" and ""Clones"" didn't happen.Never before ""Revenge of the Sith"" did I see a crowd rooting for the bad guy. I don't think anyone wanted to see the good guys lose, but everybody knew it would happen, which took a lot of the steam out of the dramatic moments, duels and scenes when you know from the first (yes the first) films how it all turns out--- only thing you're lacking is how, and that's what has drawn people to see this movie, made by a very creative but mediocre director, and a man who writes dialogue like an old comic book. Sometimes I felt like I was listening to lines from the 1966 Batman TV Series.""You're beautiful.""""If I'm beautiful, it's because I'm in love.""""You're beautiful because I am in love with you.""That was only the beginning, but it was also when the guy in front of me asked me to stop banging my head against the back of his chair. These poor actors are going to be flamed by people for their acting, when the problem all along as not been the acting but the lines they are given to try and perform with sincerity. I bet Hayden Christiansen wanted to commit seppuku with his lightsaber for some of the stupid things Lucas makes him say.But guess what? That's it. That's all that is bad about Revenge of the Sith, and when you get past the dialogue, and get to the meat of the story you're hooked. Just accept that Lucas can't write, or direct actors well, or direct anything at all unless it's in front of a green screen, don't expect too much and this movie will be awesome. I had a blast, but my expectations were low, and much of it was me feeding off the energy of the younger, less pessimistic crowd. My advice is this---expect utter suckiness. If you're going into it expecting the grandest movie experience yet... sorry. But he did make this one worth watching, more than once--- then you can buy it on DVD, and later on you can buy it again in a *special edition* DVD and maybe in 30 years, he'll revamp Menace and Clones and they will be good too, but I doubt that.I'm sorry. My lack of respect for George Lucas is making this film sound worse than it is. ""I love Star Wars but I am so over George Lucas"" (That's the title of my review of the Special Edition Trilogy-- read that and see how deep my contempt goes).What I'll say is that Revenge of the Sith isn't the little kiddie ""Phantom Menace"" (though it has its moments), and it's not the corny ""Attack of the Clones"" (though it has its moments). This one is darker and far more thrilling than its two prequel predecessors, and boy did it ever have the feel of Old School Star Wars to me--- the closer to the end it got, the more like Star Wars if felt, and that's cool. To watch the great and good Jedi betrayed and done for, with such cold bloodedness--- you feel their loss even though you can't help but applaud when the Palpatine becomes the Emperor and Anakin becomes Darth Vader, and again when he puts on the heavy breathing Vader suit--- ""Yeah THIS is what I paid the bargain matinee to see!""We all also applauded when Obi Wan hands the infant Luke over to Owen and Beru--- because the *good* Star Wars Trilogy is what this pulpy crap was made to introduce--- Lucas ties them together very well in the end, and I can be a real gork and get into some of the details that irked me, but hey, this was a good, good movie worth three of the stars I gave it, the fourth is because it's Star Wars, and as much  as I wanted to see Lucas implode on this one, I'm afraid I underestimated the power of the dark side."	4.0	Believe the hype!

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AAY1YLTKK4JC7	"Martin Andrade ""Media Gurgitator"""	"It will be very difficult to do this movie justice.  In this final episode in the George Lucas' Star Wars prequels, Lucas puts together completes the story in a slam dunk manner.  I must admit, I was very surprised by how good this film turned out to be.  In many ways, at least in my mind, this film redeems Lucas for his failings as a director, and his failings in the director's cuts of his original trilogy.In this film, the seduction and fall of Anakin Skywalker is played out, and he descends to become the Darth Vader we will know (and do know) in Star Wars episodes IV-VI.  We also see how Emperor Palpatine comes to power, how the Republic is dismantled, how the Jedi are massacred, and how the clone war comes to an end.  Quite frankly, it was almost too much, even for a 140 minute movie.It is probably for this reason that the movie glosses over the deaths of the Jedi Order, which was actually anti-climatic.  This oversight, as well as some other negative aspects in the film are worth noting right away.  The biggest weakness in the film is the casting of Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker.  His performance is only tolerable when he isn't speaking.  This is coupled with a less than stellar performance by Natalie Portman, who portrays Padme, the mother of Luke Skywalker and Leia, makes for some mind numbing scenes of dialogue between the two.Fortunately this movie had a number of strong performances, including Ewan McGregor's portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ian McDiarmid as Emperor Palpatine.  There are other notable performances too, including Samuel L. Jackson's ""Mace Windu,"" which is underutilized, and a surprisingly strong cast of extras and bit players.Acting was clearly the weakness of ""Revenge of the Sith.""  Despite that, it still makes par, and is overshadowed in my mind to how strong everything else in the movie is done.  The biggest success of this film has to be the computer animation.  The movie moves seamlessly from blue screen to computer animation to live action.  One would be hard-pressed to show a more successful use of special effects.  Only the Lord of the Rings trilogy rivals in the special effects arena.This film also has a strong showing in action sequences.  The final climatic battles are some of the best martial arts sequences one is ever going to find.  One sequence is between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi, the other is between Yoda and Emperor Palpatine.  Both are a credit to George Lucas.  As far as I can remember, and I've seen a lot of films, there has never been as good a sword fighting sequence as the one in this movie between Vader and Kenobi.  I was personally in awe as I was watching.There is a lot I'm not mentioning, but look for the character development of R2D2, who has a number af great action sequences.  Note how Lucas actually completes the story for us, covering up potential problems in the timeline.  I can't say enough, see this film."	5.0	Excellent	2005-05-19	0	0	0

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3U02XWSCEESPP	Mary L Wagner	In order to prevent the future he fears, Anakin causes it to happen.  It's always interesting to get the story backwards; Babylon 5 did this very well, first showing the effect, only later revealing the cause.  However, the specific fear of Anakin that Palpatine manipulates makes Anakin's first and greatest atrocity as Darth Vader ring false.Great visual moments include- The opening battle sequence, despite its resemblance to Starship Troopers- The lightsaber duels- Anakin marching into the Jedi Temple with the clones/stormtroopers- The isolation and extinction of the Jedi- Anakin's physical transformation into Darth Vader- The final scene watching the two moons over TatooineOther great scenes include- Anything with Yoda- Obi-Wan and Anakin's witty exchanges during the first scenes- Palpatine facing Dooku, Mace Windu, and YodaCringe-worthy moments include:- Any time Hayden Christen opens his mouth - great physical acting, horrible horrible horrible dialogue in writing and presentation- Any time Natalie Portman opens her mouth - she is such a good actress, what on earth happened here?The older actors are the only ones who are comfortable with the bad dialogue and deliver it well. It takes subtlety and experience not to overact such key scenes as Dooku's betrayal and Palpatine's seduction. Interestingly, you can actually see Ewan McGregor grow into this ability during the movie, just as Mark Hamill did over the course of the original trilogy.Overall, the final scenes satisfy both emotionally and in storytelling.  John Williams score is excellent, and the different worlds are rich enough to warrant much repeat viewing.	4.0	Cannot Escape Fate	2005-05-23	7	3	4

While ""Sith"" is better than either Episode 1 or 2 (damning with faint praise tho' that may be) it's ultimately a disappointment.  The special effects, space battles, lightsaber battles and creatures are superb;despite knowing the outcome, the battles frequently kept me on the edge of my seat. The characters are flat, Anakin seems to be suffering little more than teen angst; Padme is reduced to a teary hausfrau.  Ewan MacGregor is the bright spot in the film; while saddled with the traditional stilted Lucasian dialogue he brings wit and a sparkle to Obi-Wan and it's easy to extrapolate to the twinkly eyed old desert magician we grow to love in Episode 4.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A35ANED4U5V54D	Master Jedi	"As many of you Star Wars fans have come to know, episode III answers many questions that we have all asked ourselves over the past several decades.  We know that Anakin becomes Darth Vader, but we didn't know why until now; this is why episode III is such a critical juncture in the Star Wars saga; it serves as the pivot point into the original trilogy.  One can see many similarities between eipsode III and IV, remember the blockade runner in both episodes.I've read many reviews that criticize the movie and I'm here to say don't listen to them.  Everyone has their own opinion, and it's up to you to watch the film and decide for yourself.  This is by far the best of the prequels and would rival as one of the best out of the entire six episodes.  After watching episode III, we better understand the original trilogy better and can see that Anakin's ""transformation"" had its roots in episode I.  Recall the prophecy read by Qui-Gon when he first met Anakin and relate it to Palpatine's teachings in episode III during the opera scene.  You will uncover a very interesting piece of information, which is dependent on your point of view.Therefore, each prequel episode plays an integral role in teh Star Wars saga that sets the groundwork for the death of the Republic, the rise of the Empire and Rebellion from the original trilogy.  George Lucas has a story to tell that mirrors human society from antiquity only.  The things that have happened since and during the release of the prequel trilogy is absolute garbage.  There is no correlation between current events and what happens in the Star Wars movies.  What Lucas has done is take Roman society and put a sci-fi twist to it, in my own humble opinion.In the end, this is an excellent movie and answers many of the questions we've all had at one point or another.  This is certainly a movie you can watch over and over again and still pick up something new you may have missed the first or second time watching it.May the Force be with you!"	5.0	Anakin's Plight to the Dark Side Revealed	2005-11-22	1	1	0

Jar Jar gets on everyones nerves and we have to listen to Kwi Gon explain everything to young Anakin, even though the audience knows whats going on.Episode II, though just as boring at some parts with the whole love thing going on with Anakin and Padme, is a much better movie because the action keeps things interesting.Episode III. This one is the best. It starts exciting and there is a lot less slowing the movie down. The whole movie keeps the audience interested. Though Anakin turning to the dark side so quickly was surprising, I can see how it happened. What I was disappointed with was the end of the battle between Mace Windu and the Emperor. I knew what had to happen, yet part of me was screaming ""slit his throat, moron, before he gets you with his lightning!!"" yet Mace just rubs victory in the emperors face and keeps telling Anakin that the emperor has to be killed. That was the only part I thought was explained poorly, though I wish they would have shown more jedi temple and Kashyyyk action. The ending showdown was definitely a high point. Anakin and Obi Wan battling was about as far from disappointing as you can get (I dont know what some of the other reviewers are talking about) and the emperor taking on Yoda was also good, though I was left wondering why Yoda didnt use the force to get his lightsaber and keep fighting. I also thought it funny that what Anakin was seeing in his dreams was the consequence of going to the dark side. If he had ignored the dreams nothing would have gone wrong.

Yeah I even think it's better than the old ones.  First off, This links all the movies together, so we finally get to see the whole picture, of where all the pieces needed to go.  There are absolutely amazing graphics in this movie, this is the best one visually ever made, it blows 1 and 2 out the window.  There are a lot of comedy scenes actually, R2-D2 was a hoot, he had me laughing a lot throughout the whole movie, which made it funner than any other Star Wars movie.  This was a very dark movie though.  Lots of Jedi die, nearly all of them.  The dark side of the force really seems to take over in this one.  It was kind of depressing that all this happened, it sure kept me on the edge of my seat though, just wanting to see what was going to happen next.  The most important part of the movie though was the Rise of Darth Vader.  Everyone was waiting for that moment.  I must say it gave me goosebumps all over my body the first time I heard the breath from the suit, it was awesome.  This movie is a must see also because this is the movie with the most lightsaber duels.  There are a ton of great duels in this one.  Yoda vs. The Emperor, Obi-1 vs. Anakin, Count Dooku vs. Anakin and Obi-1, plus a couple of more that you will have to check the movie out to see, one is completely amazing though.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AG42CYU5P8NVQ	Mathew A. Shember	After the disappointment of episodes 1 and 2; I borrowed a copy and watched this film.I will say that it was better then 1 and 2 but that is not saying much.  The plot line has been covered in all the other reviews so I will keep my review to observations.FX wise the film was nice too look at.I have never liked Hayden as Anakin.  He is far too pouty and his acting is rather plain to portray the future Hitler of Space.  Even though I knew what Anakin would become, Hayden couldn't even give me that feeling of hope that he would not do it.  If you want to see a guy on the edge; look at Batman Begins!Ewan was finally starting to feel like the Obi-Won that we all know.The relationship just didn't do it for me between the two.  Again, look to Batman Begins on what this relationship should have been.  Liam and Christian Bale were excellent.Thank god Jar Jar was only an appearance and said nothing!The Jedi seemed to be floundering on this.  When the order came to eliminate them; they were all taken by surprise.  I guess the Force wasn't working that day?The Wookies.  The ads gave the impression of a Wookie fight but it was lost with the clone troopers.  They even didn't get to save Yoda.Speaking of such; if I was going to eliminate Yoda, I wouldn't send a handful of troopers to do it.  What would have been interesting is say 50 and have the Wookies come to Yodas aid.Padme and Anakin.  Just didn't get the spark between the two.  I think it could have been more effective if part of the anguish was the fact the two were taking opposite sides.  Padme was a queen after all.  She would still feel for the people.Anakins attack on the temple.  This was an opportunity to really hate the guy but it was just not delivered right for me.  George probably tried to keep the Pg13 so he didn't show you Anakin butchering the kids.  However, it could have been effective to say add children screams in the background when Yoda sensed something.What was up with General Grievous and the coughing?There were deleted scenes.  One good cut(the slaying of Jedi by Grievous).  It would have been lame to watch Anakin and Obi-won doing an Abbot and Castello scene with all the gestures of their plan of attack.I wished they kept the senator scenes as they showed the seeds of the future rebellion.The dumbest cut was Yoda going to Degobah.  George reasoned the end of the movie had to deal with the Skywalker family but Yoda is probably one of the most loved characters of the series.  It was a beautiful shot and it will probably get added back.The introduction of Darth Vader was good but when he Screamed NOOOOOOOOOOOOO I got the image of Ned Flanders on the Simpsons.Thus ends the sad decline for what was my favorite series as a kid.  I can't count how many times I went to see episodes 4, 5, and 6.  I saw episode 1 twice.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1EKPE5VPWPD61	matt c	Episode III is easily my favorite film from the series. It's got everything you could want in a star wars film. A great opening space battle, which definetely rivals the ones in the original series when the rebels went up against each death star.The lightsaber battles are always great, but the one between Kenobi and Skywalker at the end, that definetely takes number one in my book, with the battle of vader and luke in Empire strikes back taking a close 2nd. And of course Yoda vs. The emperor, classic, digital yoda kick a**.One of my favorite scenes was the when yoda goes to the wookie planet. An overall great sequence. Cool visuals of the Wookies fighting.But the best scene of the whole movie and the thing i have been waiting to see for years, is the transformation of Anakin to Vader. That sequence was just so good, i was moved. I mean i really felt it when he breathes his first breath as vader and then when the Emperor says Lord Vader, Rise. Totally great George, couldn't have done it any better.And now my gripes, and they is only a few.One: The Wookie planet, could have extended the scene a little bit more.Two: The deleted Yoda sequence. Come on George, 30 secs and you had to cut it. Please, you could have squeezed it in. Your the man George, but sometimes you confuse me.Three: The dialog between Anakin and Padme. Granted it was better then the first two, but still, i would have cut the whole line when she's standing on the balcony. It was a little bit cheezy.Beyond that, Episode III rocks, and i loved it. Sucks though, now star wars is over,LOTR is done, Matrix is done, star trek is stalled. Hope something new comes along, help us out George. lol.	4.0	Episode III Kicks Major A**	2005-11-17	6	2	4

Kenary	"It could of gotten a 4.5 but lack of Depth in some of the characters and story hold me back a bit (esp. up against Episode 4 and 5).Reasons why this movie triumphs:1. The special effects are, hands down, the best I have ever seen.  I'm still in shock on the vast improvement even compared to the Attack of the clones.2. The opening sequence was, finally, a good opening sequence( which the previous 2 movies lacked), you can't do wrong by opening the movie with 20 minute action scene.3. General Grievous was cool new character.4.Death  of Count Doku (decapitation is always cool).5. No Jar Jar Dialogue6. Ewan MacGregor, you couldn't get anyone better to play a young Obi-wan (except maybe Sir Alec himself)...7. Obi-wan vs. Anikan (my only complaint is that there could have been more bantering than there was)8. Ani on fire,  I didn't expect them to show as much as they did.9. Lot's of light Saber action ( dare I say maybe too much)10. the wookies ( but I'm not understanding why they were in the movie)Reasons why this movie is not  a 5 star movie:1.Padme is annoying and her death was stupid (Ani , your breaking my heart). Plus she looked better dead than alive.2. Samuel L. Jackson character (Mace Windu) could've have been better.  All he seemed to do was whine and moan.  I was actually relieved to see him ""bite it"" early.3. Death of Count Duku (I like Christopher Lee).4. No Jar Jar Dialogue (I have no new material for Jar Jar mocking)5. Padme's princess Leah's hairdo, of all the movie's references to the original star wars this is the one they should have left out.6. Yoda gives up a little to easily ( he wants to ""regroup)...with who, all the Jedi's are dead.  Wimp7.  Anikan kneels a little too quickly to Sidious, one minute he was upset that he killed Mace Windu next he's kneeling and saying ""master"".Overall this is the best one since Empire Strike Back.  i wasn't cringing every 2 seconds with corny dialogue and dopey characters.  It's 75% action and it barely let up. The making of vader was cool and the hiding of Luke and Leah was a respectable lead into episode 4.

The ultimate Episode III dvd experience comes November 1 and same with the ultimate StarWars shooter experience happens the same day with the release of StarWars Battlefront II. November 1 is going to be a day I'll cheerish for a long time and I can't wait until they release that new StarWars cartoon series based on what happens right after Episode III. The show has three remaining Jedi who survived the exacution of Order 66 and it has the Emperior and Darth Vader in it the skitches for Darth Vader look incredible. I hope he duels Jedi in this cartoon series and I hope each episode is a least 20 minutes each because the Clone Wars cartoon series episodes were too short season 1 episodes were like 5 minutes long each and there was only 20 episodes in the first season. Season two is better and each episode is ten minutes long kind of like the length of a Sponge Bob episode. Anyways season two is really good is well same length as the first season but only has half of the amount of episodes as season one contains oh well I just hope this new and upcoming StarWars cartoon series better than the Clone Wars cartoon series hopefully.

BRAGER ""mbrager"""	From other ratings I've gathered that Star Wars fans are so starved for something good (after I & II), they deliberately overlooked III's flaws.The episodes that had to make all the transformations into the characters of the original Star Wars saga were put together in a better, if predictable, story line; and the acting was improved -- but, ughh, the dialog in the latter part of the movie was atrocious.  Anakin's denial to Padme that he was Sith leaped to confirmation and did I miss a few lines in there?  No? But Lucas did, leaving the exchange unbelievable and poorly acted.  Where's Padme's reaction when Anakin's conceded what he's done?After Yoda's failed battle with the Emperor, he announces he's going into 'exile'?  Wow, I never took Yoda for a quitter, but there it was.  Ah, yeah, regroup -- but quit?  Well, later he says he'll return when the time is right.Too many scenes didn't have enough lead drama to make them sufficiently compelling.  We know what's going to happen, and that made it more difficult, but too much was contrived rather than built to.Unfortunately, Lucas went into some anti-Bush propaganda, too:  the silly either your with me or my enemy bit.  Didn't fit.  I didn't mind the roll back the powers thing between Senate and Emperor because it worked and created the first working intricacies of the Republic other than the vague impressions previously used.  Padme's liberties are lost with applause worked too.  However, Obi Wan's line that only the Sith believe in absolutes was a farce.  The Jedi absolutely believe the Sith are evil and Obi Wan says it shortly later in the film.  I wanted to remind him (and Lucas) --  Lucas really failed there, because if the Sith aren't truly evil and it's just a different view and the Sith believe the Jedi are evil, well, isn't Vader maybe the good guy and Luke is evil and Lucas is just playing with us?  Lucas just destroyed the entire meaning of his whole saga.  But it was just fun!  With the fixes, this could have/should have been a five star movie.  It wasn't close and that's a shame.	3.0	Needed more refining	2005-05-28	9	5	4
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AFJCOP0GKZH6C	M. B. Trapp	"In some sense the original Star Wars trilogy helped form the very structure of my childhood imagination. I always tried to hang in with the ""in"" crowd and be cool growing up, but I was also a closet geek, spending a lot of my time at the arcade or in the comic book store. For years as a kid we heard rumors that Darth Vader had received the injuries that forced him to wear ""the suit"" at the hands of his former master Obi Wan Kenobi after a duel on a lava planet. Thus the telling of the prequel story - the fall of Anakin Skywalker to the dark side of the Force and the rise of the Emperor - has been, in the words of Harry Knowles, ""the holy grail of my geek soul."" Growing up, we also heard that George Lucas was planning on telling the story of Anakin Skywalker in a trilogy of prequel movies.In 1999 when Episode I: The Phantom Menace came out I was excited as any tin foil hat wearing geek had a right to be. Unlike most people, I actually liked Episode I. I recognized that it didn't have the charm or the same quality of characters as the original trilogy, but it delivered on what was always the most important aspect of Star Wars for me: it took me to an imaginative world I had never been to before, a world where it wasn't hard to tell who was good and who was bad, a world of dogfights in space and huge ground battles involving droids and strange alien creatures riding even stranger beasts of burden. The ""magic"" of Star Wars was not diminished in my eyes by Episode I, even if other aspects of it were. Episode II also delivered the same Star Wars magic, but I remember leaving the theater very disappointed. The acting was terrible, the plot was incomprehensibly goofy, and it felt more like a cartoon than a serious fantasy movie (if such a term is not an oxymoron; in my opinion it isn't). Now we come to Episode III, and my initial reaction was this: This is what we Star Wars fans wanted when we first signed up for the prequels!. Episode III does something that the first two prequels didn't: it creates a compelling human interest story that actually manages to develop a real sense of emotion and human drama. It is interesting, while watching Anakin Skywalker being slowly turned to the dark side, to contrast this with the path of his son.  Luke was faced with a strong temptation to join the dark side.  As Vader tells him, if he turns then together they can ""end this useless conflict,"" and father and son will no longer be at odds.So it might be said that Luke had as much to gain by turning to the dark side as Anakin, but unlike his father, he manages to resist the temptation. Why is this? Why does the father fail where the son succeeds? It is difficult to tell. It could be argued that the way Lucas portrays Anakin's slide into darkness is such that it seems that he couldn't have made any other choice. In his mind, the dark side just seems to make for a better world. But I don't think this is the case. Episode III's Anakin Skywalker is truly a tragic hero. His flaw is that he willingly chooses illicit power to aid him in achieving what he sees as a legitimate goal. When I first heard that this was the impetus for the transformation of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader, I was a little miffed. Darth Vader turns to the dark side because he's trying to be a nice guy? It just didn't seem to work. But after seeing the finished product, I had the opposite reaction. Every time I see Vader on screen in the original trilogy now, he becomes a much deeper character, a character whose inner conflicts as a young man were so intense that they actually turned him into a monster.  For me, Episode III redeems the previous two prequels, at least somewhat. Even the terribly written and terribly acted love story in Episode II is made more poignant by the tragic events that unfold in Episode III.After Episode II, my faith in Lucas as an imagineer was still intact, but my view of Lucas as a storyteller had been shot. Episode III has restored that faith. It is clear that this is the story Lucas had in mind all along: the sad story of a physically strong but emotionally weak man whose terrible decisions lead to tragedy. Episodes I and II were basically elaborate setups for this story. Yes, the acting is still a little wooden in areas (a stronger lead as Anakin would have helped immensely), but the dialogue is much stronger this time around and even the love bits were much more convincing. The tie-ins to Episode IV were subtle but efficient, even if there were a few loose ends that weren't tied up.While walking out of the theater after seeing this movie a second time, I was hit with the sudden realization that part of my childhood was gone. Return of the Jedi is the first movie I can remember my parents taking me to see at the theater, and for 22 years since then Star Wars has helped form the fabric of my imaginative life. Now it's all over. The feeling was similar to the one I had after I finished reading The Lord of the Rings for the first time: a sadness over the fact that I would never again be able to experience such a thing for the first time, with fresh eyes and a somewhat unformed imagination. At 27 I am finishing up my Master's degree and I have a baby on the way.  The realities of adulthood have set in, but I find value in letting the kid in me retain some remote compartment of my soul.  The interesting thing is that I don't think I do it entirely by choice.  There seems to be something engrained in my ontological make-up that causes this dreaming desire.This human desire (although it seems to manifest itself more in men than in women) is what C. S. Lewis called sehnsucht. He wanted a word that would convey that deep sense of desire that many people have to be free from this world, that longing that drives people to explore and create. Lewis saw this desire as being built in to us by God Himself. Lewis' maxim was that since nothing in this world could truly satisfy him, then he must have been created for another world. In a sense, the human drive to visit other worlds is an expression of our dissatisfaction with this one. We express our desire for heaven by visiting, for example, that galaxy far, far away or Tolkien's Middle Earth. Why is it that 17 of the top 20 films of all time deal with mythic or fantastic themes (and of the three that don't, one is ""The Passion of the Christ"")? I think it's because people express the lack of fulfillment they find in this world by visiting other ones. Because the world is fallen, we dream. I confess that this is a role that Star Wars plays for me.  I do not agree with the spiritual worldview that Star Wars espouses, but I appreciate it as a mythic story of immense imagination that deals with human weakness, redemption and man's need to rightly relate himself to the ultimate reality of the universe."	5.0	This is what we expected from the prequels...	2005-05-27	17	12	5

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A17LSEN4UY4XZQ	M. Daneker	"There are some surprises in Episode III, the first of which is most likely that it is actually coherent and gripping to watch. Unlike Ep.I which drug on and on in the middle, encumbered by an unexciting pod race to which the conclusion was a no-brainer (and is painfully longer on DVD) and barely resurrected by the excellent duel at the end with the mediocre space battle and silly-as-hell ground war; or Ep.II which held no plot and had an ending so muddled it barely makes sense and leaves you scratching your head; Ep.III has a tight plot and an emotional center.Revenge of the Sith starts out with the pointless rescue of senator Palpatine, now since we all know he's the Sith Lord, why has he been kidnapped and what purpose does this hold? None. The beginning is nothing more than an action device designed to start the film off.It gets better from there. Anakin has dreams of Padame dying in child birth like the ones he had of his mother in Ep.II (so that's why they made that movie?) which came true so he becomes obsessed with keeping his newly pregnant bride from dying, at any cost. In comes Palpatine, carefully placing Anakin in situations where he can point to the Jedi as leading him down the wrong path and seduce him with the idea that the Sith may know how to stop death.Of course, it all works for Darth Sideous (Palpatine) as Anakin grows more weary of the Jedi ""holding him back"" and more frightened by the prospect of loosing Padame, he finally chooses to spare Palpatines life by attacking Mace Windou (don't ask me how they spell it!!!) His journey to the dark side has begun. From here on Anakin is sworn to the dark side, and betrayed by it as it is quickly revealed that it is everything he does to save Padames' life that are the very things that cause her death in the first place. By listening to Yoda and pushing those fears aside he could have averted everything, saved the Jedi and ended the Sith once and for all.As finally the children are born (to an not nearly big enough Padame) cut with scenes of Vader being built onto Anakins mutilated body, the Shakesperian Tradgety aspect unfolds. And when Vader realizes just what he's done, it actaully hits home and is deeply disturbing.Of course, in the end he is the one that bring balance to the force, by fathering Luke that is.This is an exciting and superior prequel worthy of its title and with too few flaws (like Obi Wons' silly bird / beast) to complain about."	5.0	From 77 to 05 the story comes full circle in fine form!	2005-06-17	11	6	5

I really liked this movie, and it did a nice job showing Anakin's defection to the Dark Side.What really got to me was the ending, where the entire story culminates and Anakin takes the final steps (a couple of unwilling ones as well, thanks to Obi-Wan Kenobi) to become the black-helmeted Darth Vader we all know and love. I wasn't quite happy with what happened to Padme though, she just... gave up. Yeah I know she was sad about what happened to Anakin, but she had her baby to think about, didn't she think about what would happen to the child?

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F	mdizzog	"This movie is much better than THE PHANTOM MENACE and the horrible ATTACK OF THE CLONES.As far as the plot goes, you know whats going to happen. You've known the end result for years. So the plot isn't really going to grab you or anything. Although, they did do a good job of tieing up most loose ends for A NEW HOPE.The action scenes are real good. Some of them seem like they were thrown in at the last minute(there didn't really need to be a battle between the wookies and the droids, but okay), but most of them seem appropriate. The lightsaber battles make the movie. The best lightsaber battle in the history of starwars is near the end of the movie. In RETURN OF THE JEDI, the lightsaber battle is real slow and doesn't really have that much intensity. The final battle in this movie is just incredible.The reason I gave this movie 4 stars is because George Lucas is trying his hardest not to listen to the fans. Nobody liked Jar Jar Binks, and he did not say a single line during the whole movie. But for some reason, they showed a clip of him walking around. Another thing, everyone complained about the acting in the second movie. Nothing has changed though. Anakin is not so whiny anymore, but he still tries to over-act every scene. Padme is horrible. She puts way too much emotion into her part. At the end of every scene she puts her hands into her face and cries. Yes, we understand she is in love with Anakin and that their love is forbidden. Not a single person seems to care about them falling in love, not even the jedi council. Also, George Lucas, I think, put his son into the movie. At one point some ""youngling"" jumps into a group of storm troopers and spins around looking real goofy. He is then shot down. The scene is so out of place that it is laughable. Honestly, you will be confused as to the whole point of the scene and whether or not you should feel sorry for the over-zealous ""youngling""To sum up, there are good action scenes, but George Lucas still found some ways to make the movie worse than it could have been.

It seems to draw fire from the hardcore fans of the original movies.I stood in line for the original Star Wars movie back in 77 and yet don't really consider myself one of the Star Wars legion.  I will have to come down on the side of disappointment on this movie as I do with the other two prequels.  In fact, I even went to them just thinking of them as stand alone movies and not even connected with the originals.  Other than the fact that the characters will end up being those original characters later in life, the movies seem extremely disconnected from the original set.  The flavor of the movies and story is not the same at all.This isn't what I disliked about the film though.  I found the story to be tedius.  It seemed line he had a point A and a point B and we were going to get from one to the other in as straight a line as possible.  I think the biggest and most disappointing example of this is how he took Aniken to the dark side of the force.  It felt embarassing actually while I watched it.  I sort of felt sorry for the film and for the audience because it seemed like a cop out.  There didn't seem to be near enough motivation for this amazing transformation and then to top it off with him murdering children.. well, it was just ugly.My feeling about the movie doesn't have me so slanted that I give the film a one star rating.

In Lucas' latest film you don't really need to listen to anything to know what is going on, because those inculcated in the Star Wars culture have already known since we watched Luke force-training with an old guy and a little green man. We know what must happen: Anakin will become evil and ""die,"" becoming the hyper-masculine sable-shrouded villain Darth Vader; his longsuffering wife Padme will bear their twins Luke and Leia and subsequently lose the will to live, resulting in the twins' separation and relegation to opposite ends of the galaxy; the Jedi will be massacred, with the exceptions of Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi; and Palpatine will take up his place as the first Galactic Emperor. There are no ""spoilers"" left for us.In light of this, Episode III becomes the ""oh, yeah"" film of the prequel trilogy, in which Lucas plays connect-the-sequels and we get to actually SEE how all the things we already know came about. Despite his best efforts and previous achievements in Episodes I and II, Lucas makes an alarmingly good film. Episode I was stupid; Episode II was stultifying. Episode III has its own dose of stupidity (Yoda is a Galaxy-class faker with that walking-stick) and its dialogue is still, for the most part, horrifically, mind-numbingly inane (""Hold me like you did by the lake on Naboo, when there was nothing but our love"" reigns supreme in this category). But somehow it achieves more than the sum of its parts: there are electrifying, spine-tingling moments in this film that parallel anything in the original trilogy, such as the moment when the familiar black helmet slides into place and we hear that first mechanical breath...I, a jaded survivor of Episodes I and II, got goosebumps.The acting is less dreadful in this than its predecessors. Haydn Christensen by far suffers the worst in Episode III...whether this is due to his lack of range or the abominable lines he is force-fed (no pun intended) is an open question. He has a few bright spots in the film, but in a role that should have smoldered, Shakespearean-like, with masculinity, vaulting ambition, and repressed sexual tension, Christensen resembles more a sulky teenager still whining that his master won't LET him do ANYTHING and he doesn't NEED his HELP. Even his romance with Padme is sadly adolescent and unconvincing. I had difficulty believing that a supposedly prodigious politician like Padme would ever fall for such a whingy excuse for a Jedi, particularly when there were actual guys like Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi around. In all fairness, though, he isn't any worse than Mark Hamill.Christensen's performance is monochromatic at best but overlookable when he is paired (fortunately, frequently) with actors like Ian McDiarmid and Ewan McGregor, who manage to rise above the inanities of the script and communicate some actual emotional depth. Some of McGregor's scenes actually achieve a measure of heartwrenching authenticity, which is a paramount achievement in a Star Wars movie. Throughout one can see reflections of Alec Guinness in his character; his often-casual delivery of lines and general benevolence is a perfect foreshadowing of Old Ben. McDiarmid is deliciously campy as Palpatine; he plays most scenes like a private joke, quietly laughing at his own insidiousness and Anakin's gullibility. Natalie Portman as Padme isn't given much to work with, unfortunate given her demonstrated talent in ""Closer"" earlier this year. She is mostly relegated to staying at home, alternately doey-eyed or weepy-eyed as the situation calls for. Given the dialogue put in her mouth (the previously mentioned lake-on-Naboo scene is only one example of a dreadful many), she acquits herself remarkably well, especially considering that I personally felt she had no talent after watching Episode I - an opinion I have been forced to rescind.Blame for the sometimes-cringe-inducing acting rests largely with the script. The dialogue is still pitifully gradeschool. Even with the help of an uncredited co-writer, Lucas manages to craft a script that bludgeons the audience with the obvious (do we really need to have said that a ship obviously hurtling through space is ""picking up speed""?) and handles moments that should be nuanced with the subtlety of a jackhammer. The love scenes are still the worst-crafted of the whole film, unfortunate considering that Anakin's supposedly (but never made believable) fanatical attachment to Padme is one of the crucial factors in his descent to the Dark Side. Padme's revelation of her pregnancy is one of the most cringe-worthy in the film: the dialogue is ludicrous, particularly coming from the mouths of a famous Senator and a poster-boy Jedi. One can almost hear the unspoken lines running through Anakin's head as he processes the news: ""Cool! I'm a dad! Can I go blow more stuff up now?"" Sadly, these would not seem too out of place in Lucas's script. The scene between them in Padme's lodgings is equally painful: rather than actually make us BELIEVE they're desperately, tragically in love, Lucas has them awkwardly declare it in terms that would not seem out of place scribbled on the walls of a highschool bathroom: ""I'm so in love."" ""No, I'm so in love with YOU."" Lucas's attempts at elevated dialogue are also woefully inadequate: the Jedi, whom he attempts to make sound intelligent and wise, sound bombastic and stunted more often than not. However, due likely to the intervention of outside forces, the script is not completely suicidal. There are moments of near-greatness, or at least those that don't suck quite as badly comparatively, such as Obi-Wan's last words to Anakin and Palpatine's self-reflections, and the moment when a still-not-quite-evil Anakin is instrumental in the destruction of a certain Jedi Master and realizes that there is now no going back.Lucas does some crucial things right, and he does them so well that the flaws are, if not easily ignorable, at least ameliorated. Foremost of these is his decision not to focus on creatures in this one: there are NO talking Gungans (for which we are all very truly thankful) and surprisingly few strange-looking beasts or other non-humanoids. This allows the human conflict of Anakin's descent into the Dark Side to take center-stage. The pacing of Episode III is just about perfect: there are no long divergences into Gungan territory or interminable Podraces and few attempts at the villainous CCR - Critter Comic Relief (although R2-D2 gets to kick some a**, which is fantastic). The first thirty minutes, in fact, plays like one long adrenaline high, where Lucas' long-overshadowed enthusiasm for space opera returns to the forefront and engages the audience like we haven't been before with the prequels. It is in the battle scenes like this one that Lucas is clearly most at home, and it shows in their quality.The effects are actually breathtaking: Lucas clearly spared no expense on anything in this production, and it shows. However, they do not overwhelm the film as they did in Episode I, and I rarely felt that CG was there just to show it off, as is all-too-frequent in the other two prequels. Even the completely CG villain, General Grievous, is impressive and entertaining. This came as a shot from left-field as Matthew Wood, the voice behind the creepy cyborg with multiple arms, is previously credited only as a sound editor. He does a good job, however, and I actually liked his scenes when most CG leaves me cold. I also appreciated the more subtle touches: the lightsabres are cold and sharp, the color palette has lost its vibrancy and is beginning to retreat to the Empire's greyscale, hue-drained shades, and some sets had an uncanny resemblance to the original trilogy's. The ""birthing"" scenes were also metaphorical in their contrasting designs, whether by intent or not: Padme's surroundings are sterile, white, brightly lit, and clean, while Anakin's are dark, bloody, smoky, shadowed, and hellish.There are moments of near-perfection in Episode III. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they do not usually involve much talking. The opening space battle has little dialogue and is stronger for it - the action alone is enough to grab our attention and remind us why we thought Star Wars was cool in the first place. The massacre of the Jedi - in my mind, the most emotionally-strong in the film - has no dialogue at all, except for the infamous ""Order 66"" and one Youngling's innocent question of Anakin: ""What are we going to do?"" That he does not suspect he will die at the hands of his supposed defender, that all the Jedi are cut down by those they supposed their allies, is a poetic moment underscored by John Williams' wailing Romantic-style strings. The climactic battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan has more dialogue, but as most of it is Obi-Wan's the scene is actually strengthened by it, and again the music by John Williams - here unabashedly Wagnerian, as Anakin makes his descent into Hell and is reborn from the inferno - is a high point in the movie. Also, the two birth scenes (Padme's childbirthing and Anakin's rebirth as Vader) are overlapped in a dialogue-free montage, heightening their significance (and just plain creepiness) in a way nothing else could. Witness also a shot of the newly-suited Darth Vader walking into a surprisingly familiar-looking control room to stand by the Emperor's side as they survey the beginnings of the Death Star. Vader says nothing, merely breathes and folds his arms over his chest in that quintessential Vader gesture, but it is perfect. And the final scene, of Owen and Beru Lars holding young Luke and gazing into a glowing Tatooine sunset, is a perfect segue into Episode IV, where we remember an older Luke doing the very same thing.Fans will appreciate the little details in the movie, such as how Obi-Wan obtains Anakin's lightsabre, which he later gives to Luke; why R2-D2 knows exactly where to find Old Ben while C-3PO has no clue about Tatooine's significance; just how Luke and Leia get relegated to their respective corners of the Galaxy; exactly why Vader needed the suit; and the revelation that Yoda and Chewbacca were actually old friends (it is a pity they were never reunited). There are continuity issues, to be sure - why does Vader never recognize C-3PO and R2, when he built one and flew  with the other? And how does he know he has a son when he believes he killed his wife before she gave birth? And why if you're trying to hide a kid would you let him keep a name with the history and implications of Skywalker? - but they are trivial and of interest really only as something to debate over now that there are no new films on the horizon. Ultimately, Episode III feels like classic Star Wars, an epic Space Opera with cool battle sequences and the occasional moment of emotional truth. It ranks second now with me only behind Episode V, and that is primarily because of the irreplaceable Harrison Ford as Han Solo. So go, take a seat, let the lights dim and the familiar yellow crawl go up, and enjoy this last and best outing of the stage-setting episodes. It's real Star Wars at last, and there's nothing else quite like it."	4.0	Actually pretty darn good...	2005-05-23	12	9	3

Also featuring some characters like Harrison Ford, Yoda, etc...""Williams has single-handed written some of the most engaging, brilliant and simply magnificant music EVER for these motion pictures, and what a horrible pity that now that we reach the last film, and Luca$ decided to completely short-change Williams by hacking apart and mutilating his music for Revenge of the Sith.  Instead of one final film with 2 hours of brilliant music, Lucas instead decided to give us an unpleasant suprise and take us down memory lane of unrelated and inconsistent music from OTHER Star Wars films and cut-and-pasted these songs into Revenge of the Sith.  WHAT ON EARTH WAS LUCAS THINKING?  IS HE MENTAL?F'r instance:  Yoda and Emperor battle and you hear 'Duel of the Fates', the Darth Maul battle music from E1.  What does this have to do with anything?  Hey George, John Williams wrote a distint theme for both characters, Yoda and Palpatine, yet we don't hear EITHER of their themes.  we hear a reuse of music from Episode 1 that has NOTHING to do with this scene.  WHY!!??Same thing with the reused Bespin music as Luke gets pummeled with floating objects, before flying out the big window.  Again, what's the relation?  Watching the film, I was sorely reminded of how much I would rather have been watching 'Empire Strikes Back' instead of this dreck.Even the end credits, you hear the 'Throne Room' music, the music from Episode 4 when Luke and Han get their metals.  Again, what's the connection?  What did this music have to do with Anakin becoming a Sith Lord?  How does Luke and Han getting a metal have anything to do with this film?It doesn't.  George Lucas is greedy and lazy and has NO RESPECT for John Williams, the greatest composer EVER.  Lucas should be thankful for Williams every day of his life, or withouth Williams Star Wars would have just been another 'Logans Run'.George - I think you might have some capital available: why don't you pay Williams to COMPLETE the music from Episode 3 (and Episode 2) and then, get this, you can greedily re-release these films again and make even more money for your empire!  Then we fans of Williams can get a complete score, and Episode 3 won't be a complete and total disapointment."	1.0	A Raw Deal for John Williams	2005-09-19	35	12	23

E Isgrig ""anakin86"""	As an eternal Warsie, of course I'm pumped for the third and final prequel, and the stitching together of this great movie saga that bookends my life once and for all.However, I don't believe it's necessary to see (a) Anakin don the mask (you know which one) and (b) the birth of BOTH twins.  There are SECRETS to be kept in the proceeding episodes, remember, folks?  For future fans watching the saga from EPISODE I up, the deep dark revelations that eventually come have to be protected so that events in the original trilogy can maintain their integrity.  If we actually see Anakin put on the suit, it will be too straight-forward.No, I hope EPISODE III ends on an enigmatic coda, where we believe Anakin is most likely dead and Obi-Wan has taken off with Padme's baby.  I'm all for the dark tone and the most grueling lightsaber fight of all time--and this needs to happen for the ages--but we have to be realistic.  Lucas can't visualize certain aspects of the saga, despite our desires to see these events we've speculated about all our lives.  If he does, such a move will cost the saga its cohesion, and EPISODE III will be an artistic blunder.What have I always hoped for with this darkest of the dark STAR WARS movies?  A surreal turn of the page, a twist, and a shocking revalation that makes us see the entire saga in a different light.  I hope Lucas remembers that the prequels were never meant to be mere technical exercises, but credible story installments that put a new spin on events we'd already witnessed.  Otherwise, there never was a legitimate reason to shoot them out of sequential order, now was there?  Wouldn't it be a shocker to discover that Anakin and Obi-Wan, knowing full well that the only way to bring down the Empire is to plant a seed within it, staged their own conspiracy against it, namely Anakin allowing himself to be nearly killed and remolded as a Sith Lord, all in a long-term plan for destroying the Emperor once Anakin's offspring, the TRUE Chosen One, comes of age to fulfill the prophecy.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3KEZLJ59C1JVH	Melissa Niksic	"I don't understand why there are some people out there who actually claim NOT to like this movie. ""Revenge of the Sith"" was absolutely spectacular! I went into the theatre expecting that this would be the best of the three prequels, which it definitely is, but I'm even going to go so far as to say that I think this is the best of all six episodes. Obviously, the majority of people are going to pledge their undying love and devotion to the first three movies, but when you look at each of them critically, you'll see that ""Revenge of the Sith"" is the best all around film.There's no real need for me to go into an extensive plot summary: by now, I think most people know what happens. Basically, ""Revenge of the Sith"" picks up a couple of years after ""Attack of the Clones."" The audience learns how Anakin Skywalker is coerced into joining forces with Emperor Palpatine and submits to the Dark Side of the Force. George Lucas did a really great job of tying a lot of loose ends and questions that needed to be answered. Unlike most of the other ""Star Wars"" films, which I think tend to be a bit choppy and poorly edited, ""Revenge of the Sith"" flows very smoothly from beginning to end. It's much darker than the other five films in the series, and that's the way it's supposed to be. ""Star Wars"" fans will not be disappointed.Here are a few of the things I liked and disliked about the film (warning: major spoilers ahead!):+ The acting was amazing. Hayden Christensen, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman all deliver outstanding performances. This is probably the most emotional of all the ""Star Wars"" films, and there are a lot of terrific scenes between Anakin and Padme, Anakin and Obi-Wan, and Anakin and Palpatine. VERY impressive!+ Since I avoided most of the trailers for the film, I had no idea that we'd be treated to a lightsaber battle between Yoda and the Emperor. That was very cool!+ The duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan was pretty amazing, too. For some reason, I have always been under the impression that Obi-Wan actually pushed Anakin INTO a volcano, so I was a little surprised at how the battle actually played out. It made sense to do it that way, though. (And MY GOD, Anakin look like hell when he was burned to a crisp! Lucas went all out, didn't he?)+ In Padme's first scene, she was wearing her hair in the famous Princess Leia buns! That was awesome!+ I'm glad that Lucas threw in so many random details: we got to see the Death Star being build, Obi-Wan picked up Anakin's lightsaber that he ends up giving to Luke many years later, and we finally get an explanation as to how certain Jedi are able to come back from the dead as ""ghosts.""+ Lots of Wookie action! (I loved when Chewbacca put Yoda up on his shoulders...too cute!)- Since the Jedi are so smart, why the heck did it take so long for Obi-Wan to figure out that Anakin was the father of Padme's child? Sheesh! And no one even figured out that they were MARRIED! There was a scene where Anakin sees Padme standing off to the side and so he tells Bail Organa to excuse him for a moment. Then Anakin and Padme are in a lip-lock before Bail Organa is completely out of the frame. PLEASE! This isn't rocket science, people.- Padme only looked about five months pregnant when she delivered the twins...I guess Lucas thought that giving her a bigger belly wouldn't make her character sexy enough. LAME!- Since I'm one of the three people on earth who actually likes Jar Jar Binks, I was disappointed that he didn't say one word during the entire film. Not one single word! (Many fans will probably be grateful for that, though, I'm sure!)- Even though Yoda said that he needed to go into exile, the film never really explained why he specifically ended up on Dagoba, of all places.- Although the acting was, for the most part, very good, there are two scenes from the film that really bugged me. I love Ewan McGregor, but I was very disappointed in him during the scene where he sees the hologram playback of Anakin with Palpatine: he barely batted an eyelash! I also thought that Vader's ""Noooo!"" when he's told of Padme's death left a lot to be desired...but how much emotion can you really express through that heavy black suit?All in all, though, this is an EXCELLENT movie! I can't wait to go see it again, and I'll probably be going back to the theatre very soon!"	5.0	AMAZING!	2005-05-20	7	4	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ADTUS88NFTW23	"Melkor ""dark lord"""	"So you know where I'm coming from: I really enjoy the original trilogy (Star Wars through Jedi).  I hate the ""special"" editions.  I can't stand The Phantom Menace (TPM), and I feel that Attack of the Clones (AOTC) is barely o.k.  That's my opinion, and if you like those films, more power to you.Going into Revenge of the Sith, I was cynical and not expecting much.  I liked it.  I didn't think it was outstanding.  I didn't hate it.  I like it (three stars).The good parts:  The dialogue and acting were vastly improved.  It is still not the quick and clever dialogue from the old trilogy, but much better than TPM or AOTC.  There was an interesting story and plot to follow this time around.  There was not even one line from Jar Jar.  Also, none of the really awful C3PO comic relief dialogue like, ""I have a splitting headache"" (ugh).  R2 really is the coolest.  There were Blockade Runners, volcanic fights, the Emperor seizing control, and many other details that made this feel more like a Star Wars movie than either AOTC or TPM.The not so good parts:  Here's the nice thing.  Unlike the previous two prequels, I don't have any HUGE gripes that make me heavily dislike this film.  I just have a few nit-picks, that took from the overall enjoyable experience.  First, like many others, I feel like there was too much going on here, and Anakin was on the express lane to the Dark Side.  If planned properly, this film could have been stretched into two really enjoyable films.  This has the effect, of making me dislike TPM even more, because as far as progressing the story, that movie was entirely unnecessary.  But, it's too late for ""could haves"" and ""should haves"".  It is annoying, but it can't be helped.Remember, I warned about SPOILERS.  In Jedi, Leia says that she remembers her mother, who was always sad and died when she was young.  From that line, the story one could imagine is that when Anakin goes off the deep end, Padme escapes him, starts the rebellion, and remarries Bale Organa.  Not only does it make sense for the continuity, it makes sense for the story.  Padme was a strong and independent character who seemed to put her principles above everything.  So, she's going to die of a ""broken heart""?  It just didn't seem to fit her character.Yoda-speak.  George Lucas and Frank Oz needed to go back and watch Empire.  Yoda doesn't need to do the backwards talk 100% of the time.  After two hours, a little annoying, it got.  I am told that the coughing robot is explained in Clone Wars Vol. 2.  Maybe that will be less bothersome when I see it explained.One more.  The final light saber battle felt like it was missing something.  Even the most adamant Phantom Menace hater (like myself) will admit that the one shining moment in that movie is the light saber battle with Darth Maul.  That one, and the two Vader vs. Luke battles, had something that the Obi vs. Anakin battle was missing.  In the previous battles, the fighting is so intense that the viewer can practically smell the sweat and blood coming from the screen.  I didn't get that feeling from the battle in Sith.  Instead, we had people effortlessly bouncing around like superballs, and the way they moved across the set seemed more like Mario Brothers than an exciting sword fight.Lucas apologist:  I'm actually going to defend Lucas?  Yes I am.  As I said, I didn't have any MAJOR problems with this film; just nit-picks.  I have seen several complaints below about scientific consistency and conflicts with reality in Sith.  I think it's important to remember that Star Wars is not science fiction, it is fantasy.  Science fiction usually uses the future as either an idealist's thought experiment, or a cautionary tale of what could come to pass.  It is usually a commentary on the current world we live in (Ender's Game, Star Trek, 1984, Brave New World, etc.).  In science fiction, creating a believable and ""possible"" future is important.  On the other hand, fantasy and myth, which usually take place ""long ago and far away"" or ""once upon a time"", are generally used to express tales of morality, personal growth, and ethics.  In fantasy it is less important to be a stickler to scientific and reality based facts.  That is why in Star Wars, we do not mind that troops fly space craft into battle without space suits or oxygen masks, for example.  So there is no need to get worked up about Padme ""not having an ultrasound"" or the Death Star ""being built so quickly"".  Let it go and enjoy the film.My ratings:Star Wars/Empire: 5 StarsJedi: 4 Stars (-1 for Chewie doing the Tarzan yell.)Sith: 3 StarsClones: 2 StarsMenace: 1 StarSpecial Editions: 0 Stars"	3.0	A good movie.

After three kickass movies and two prequels, the first of which I must have been nuts not to notice how crappy it was and the other I was sane enough to know was totally crappy, we finally have a prequel that is (almost) as good as the original three and, quite honestly, the most emotional of them all.We all know what's going to go down in this, the final chapter of the Star Wars saga, but we are not prepared for how it will go down. Yes, we know which characters are meant to buy the farm and what is to happen to some of our most beloved characters. But as one enters the theatre, or in this case, pops the movie into one's DVD player, one is simply not ready for the emotion.The visuals are amazing from the opening battle sequence to the final lightsaber duel on Mustafar. And this film also boasts the best batch of lightsaber duels ever seen on screen (there are five in all.)But at the heart of this roller coaster ride is a story of a man who strays down the wrong path and ultimately loses everything.Hayden Christiansen does a much better acting job than he did in Attack of the Clones. In that one, he was just whiny. In this one, he achieves just the right amount of brooding.Not much can be said about Natalie Portman. So many of her scenes were cut, she seems more like an ornament.Christopher Lee should stay the hell away from making trilogies of any kind. He either gets killed off in the third movie or cut out of it completely, and both of these things happened to him in The Lord of the Rings.Ian McDiarmid steals the show as he sheds his true colors as Emperor Palpatine. Such was his performance that I was hoping he would be nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, even though I knew it was a long shot.As heartbreaking as it is to see the events unfold, the most heartbreaking is the montage covering the elimination of the Jedi. To see these innocent victims cut down, particularly such characters as Ki-Adi Mundi, who has been with us in all three films, is truly heartbreaking.Also truly gutwrenching is Anakin's downfall as he becomes Darth Vader. When the mask is finally placed on his face, you're on the edge of your seat waiting for that first chilling breath. And when he is raised on that medical table, fully suited, you see that Anakin's tragic transformation is complete.I remember watching the Twentieth Century Fox logo and the ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"" card projected onto the screen. I also remember leaving the theatre as the credits played. Those two times, it hit me that I was about to see and had seen (respectively) the final Star Wars movie.So, my friends, if you rent this, the final chapter in one of the greatest movie sagas of all time, expect more than dazzling special effects.Grade: A+"	5.0	"The trilogy comes to an end and describing that end as ""satisfying"" does not do it justice"	2006-05-29	10	6	4

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2E9TRM8096BXU	"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson"""	"A year or so before REVENGE OF THE SITH came out, I asked a Hollywood insider if there was any prospect of the movie being better than an oversize plate of Bantha-poodoo. His reply was a shrug. When I demanded an explanation as to why I should even have to ask that question, this is what I heard:""Lucas doesn't get it."" He said. ""He doesn't understand what he's created. To him, STAR WARS is nothing more than throwaway entertainment, Saturday Afternoon Matinee stuff. He has no real feeling for the material. Everything from him wanting to edit out Han's `I know' comment to Leia to the decision to retroactively make Guido fire first in the cantina sequence, from casting Jake Lloyd to creating Jar Jar Binks - it all says he's clueless and isolated. Frankenstein had a better understanding of his monster!""I had to agree. While admiring Lucas, I was, after two films, thoroughly exasperated with him. PHANTOM was turgid, lifeless, wooden, boring, silly, dreary, and horrendously written. CLONES, while much improved, suffered many of the same problems - sluggish pacing, clunky dialogue, inconsistent acting, visual clutter. So it was with considerable trepidation that I went to L.A.'s Arclight theater to watch the final (?) installment of my childhood passion, REVENGE OF THE SITH.My initial impression was grim. It seemed Lucas' propensity for dialogue ""with the cadence of the typewriter"" (to quote Harrison Ford) was unchanged, as was his almost obsessive desire to cram every frame of film with starships, fighters, explosions, robots, droids, stars, planets, clones, aliens, etc., until you felt you were half-nauseous.Very quickly, however, I realized there were fundamental differences in SITH that would elevate it above its predecessors. The first was the frequent presence of Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine/Darth Sidious (his supreme talents, showcased in RETURN OF THE JEDI, were barely touched in the previous two installments.) The second was that the plot convolutions of the first two films, at times almost impenetrable, now began to tie themselves together in very entertaining fashion. Last, and most important, was that Lucas...""got it.""SITH is not merely the culmination of the prequel series; it is the bridge between that series and the original. It is the ""backstory"" that any 70s-80s kid who ever pondered exactly what the hell put Darth Vader in that helmet, how the Jedi were overthrown and the Empire came to be, who Luke & Leia's mother was, or exactly what the hell the ""Clone Wars"" were, always wanted. More importantly, it is a real film; the fact that I knew precisely the how the final duel between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi would end, and yet managed to be shocked by that ending, says everything on how effectively Master Lucas told his tale.SITH would have been a challenge for any storyteller. Unlike EMPIRE, which at least tacitly implied that all the wrongs done to our beloved heroes would soon(ishly) be put right, we all knew that there would be no happy endings here. Padim&eacute; would die and her children be hidden away; the Jedi would be wiped out and the Republic overthrown;  Anakin would sumberge into the Dark Side and emerge, breathing heavily, as Darth Vader. Not quite as uplifting as, say, ROCKY. But by embracing the tragedy rather than sugar-coating it, and simultaneously weaving it into the redemptive story to come, Lucas made a masterwork which will stand all time and all criticism. SITH, despite its many warts and brown spots, is quite simply, a hell of a movie.In SITH, Lucas finally grasped that he wasn't grinding out a epileptic digitial cartoon, or an extended commercial for STAR WARS merchandise, but rather polishing off a mighty fantasy series that was dearly beloved by uncountable millions of people. By treating his material with respect, even reverence, he elevated SITH to a level previously only attained by A NEW HOPE and EMPIRE. In other words, he made a damned fine movie...the one we fans had waited 20 years for."	5.0	Lucas Gets It	2007-12-02	6	4	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"George Lucas' latest addition to the ""Star Wars"" franchise, ""Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith"" (2005) is, without doubt, the best of the prequels and, quite possibly, the best of all six ""Star Wars"" films that have been produced.  The film takes up several years after where the second prequel, ""Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones"" (2002), concludes.  The Clone War has been raging the entire time, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has been granted greater executive powers and Jedi have been fighting alongside the clone stormtroopers in their efforts to defeat the separatists lead by Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and the mostly robotic General Grievous (voice of Matthew Wood).  Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and his wife Padm&eacute; (Natalie Portman) have kept their marriage a secret from Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), Yoda (voice of Frank Oz), Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and the rest of the Jedi; but her announcement that she's pregnant to Anakin further complicates their relationship and makes Anakin want to bring their marriage out of hiding.  After a fierce battle in which Anakin and Obi-Wan rescue Supreme Chancellor Palpatine from Count Dooku, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine appoints Anakin to be his personal representative on the Jedi Council; but their reluctance to grant Anakin the title of 'Master' only inflames his anger and mistrust towards them.  Then, his dreams involving Padm&eacute; begin and they are not good; but he & Padm&eacute; are not the only who knows of these dreams and it is the fear contained within these dreams that make Anakin's loyalties vulnerable.  By whom and what the consequences are can only be fully appreciated by viewing this amazing conclusion to the ""Star Wars"" franchise.With superbly choreographed battle scenes (both in space and on the ground on several planets), the quality of special effects used in ""Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith"" are superb.  Also, with a story that is engaging, compelling, suspenseful and tragic, ""Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith"" will no doubt keep most audience members' complete attention throughout its 140 minutes.  Of all six ""Star Wars"" films, this film is clearly the most spiritual with its more detailed descriptions of the force (both the good and dark sides), in addition to the requirements for being a Jedi as described in the first two prequels and the conflicting interests that Anakin must finally choose between in this grand final&eacute;.  The seeds for his final choice had been planted in the first two prequels and increase my personal appreciation for events that were depicted in the first two prequels.Other notable characters in ""Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith"" include C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew, another reprised role from the original trilogy), Senator Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits), Captain Typho (Jay Laga'aia), Governor Tarkin (Wayne Pygram), Commander Cody (Temuera Morrison), Captain Antilles (Rohan Nichol), Owen Lars (Joel Edgerton) and Beru (Bonnie Piese).  Overall, I rate ""Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith"" with a resounding and well-deserved 5 out of 5 stars.  People familiar with the original 1977 ""Star Wars"" film will no doubt be very pleased with how this film ends and leads into it.  I can't wait to get a copy of it on DVD."	5.0	"""This is how liberty dies. With thunderous applause."""	2005-05-22	9	5	4

I'm a big Star Wars fan, and do plan on seeing this movie more than once, and yes, while it sounds great on paper thus far, that doesn't automatically mean that it's going to a good movie.

So, again, I wrote this to try to bring some balance to these grand proclamations saying this is the BEST MOVIE EVER!! I would like to know what movie theater you guys saw it at. If this movie is as good as the book, well, then, it could be a 3 1/2 star, or perhaps a 4. But I reserve judgment for after I've seen, heard or read something, not before.

As a True fan of Star Wars I have to say something.  First off Episode III of the Star Wars saga is Probably one of the best overall Star Wars movies EVER!!!  First off why were the Original trilogy so successful and the Prequels so...We'll not as Revered. I'll tell you.  The Original Trilogy was Unique and Groundbreaking, nobody EVER saw ANYTHING like that before.  Since then there have been a million and one Epics, Action Adventures and Blockbusters.  Simply Put For the Prequels, People wanted  Anakin to come out of the screen and walk on water.... The expectations  were Impossible.  Nothing could have matched what people were expecting. They got great movies.  That fell short.  Anything would have fell short. That is what Happened.Now to the Movie.  Here you have the Darkest of the movies, it is Anakins Decent into Madness as he Becomes Vader.  People wanted a whole movie, No a whole Trilogy of Nothing but Vader, Well This is the Story of Anikin.  Vader is at the End.  As the Clone Wars Come to an end. So do the Jedi. WE see The Magnificent Jedi Fall.  We see THe greatest duel Ever. Anakin VS. Obi-Wan timed well with Yoda vs. Darth Sideous.  It is Spectacular.  The Fact that this movie was just about excluded from the Oscars is a crime upon movie - making in itself.  People who say George lost it, didn't see the same movie I saw.  George hasn't lost a step if anything he has saved the best for last.  All Star Wars Questions were answered in this movie of Movies.  AS for all the Critics and So called ""Fans"" who think they know better and could have done better. I say  GO AHEAD I don't think you can. George Lucas Rules.

Natalie Portman is as gorgeous as ever (she didn't look too good in Garden State) and the light saber fights are awesome.  There is one scene in particular where Obi Wan fights a robot that has several light sabres in his multiple arms.The only problem I had was that the Jedi seemed to be defeated too easily after all when they have the force working for them they should be able to know when they will be ambushed.  Only Yoda seemed to have this power but I guess he is the most powerful Jedi.There was a surprise appearance of Chewbacca and some funny parts with R2D2.

Here, we still have that stiff speech but what makes up for the speech it the action although a gargatuan amount of us know what happens by the end. The lighsaber duels are fun especially the last one with Obi Wan Kenobi, played by the always great Ewan McGregor (upcoming The Island, Young Adam) and Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, played by the miscast Hayden Christensen (Shattered Glass, Life As A House) on the lava planet...duking it out with each other to see who comes out on top. Mace Windu, played by Samuel L. Jackson (XXX 1 and 2, Shaft) comes to a tradgic end as he's blown out a window after giving Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious, played by Ian McDiarmid (Sleepy Hollow) a taste of his own powers to his face making it ugly. Yoda, voiced by Frank Oz (who also is a director), is too terrific here. We get to see Chewbacca and his home planet...cant pronounce it. We get to see Padme Amidala, played by the lovely Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer), birth too twins named of course, Like and Leia...though Portman didnt give a good performance while giving birth. There's a very short lived part by Count Dooku, played by the great Christopher Lee (Lord Of The Rings Trilogy), who meets his end by getting decapitated by Anakin. Also, there's a robot badguy with a human heart and wields four lightsabers called General Greivous, voiced by Matthew Wood, who meets his end by the hands of Obi Wan. By the end we get to see how Darth Vader got his badass attire that we all love after he had a date with some molten lava and getting his legs burned off. I was excited when they put the mask on and we hear that ohh burr sound and I was excited when he was propped up....but what the hell...I was totally disappointed when Vader cut loose of his shackles and screamed NOOOOOOO..I was totally ashamed...but hey, I we get to see the start of the Death Star, which was good and how Luke was taking to Tatooine with Obi Wan looking after him and how Leia was brought to The Organa family....Jimmy Smits (Tv's NYPD Blue, Running Scared) was Bail Organa, who wasnt bad...how Yoda went into exile and so on and so forth. Another good but bad thing...the good thing is that Jar Jar Binks is barely in here but the bad thing is that he didnt die....damnit George Lucas!! EMPIRE is still the best of the bundle...of course adn this one isnt that bad but it certainly is much better then ATTACK OF THE CLONES was by far.

But...it's a human life support suit the guy is wearing.  Why would the people who designed it want the patient to look scary? Hayden Christensen goes from being a young guy with a good looking wife to being forced to wear that evil looking suit for the rest of his life, yet he doesn't really seem to care.

Sith is the best of the three prequels, but that's like saying a Pacer is better than a Gremlin or Pinto. It's all junk. Lucas failed his audience by focusing on special effects and not the story and characters. He was once interviewed as saying ""a lot of directors fall into the trap of spending film time showing off their sets."" I guess he forgot that when making these movies. Sith moves too quickly. Anakin's turn to the dark side is so quick you could miss it if you blink. The whole REASON for the prequel trilogy was to show us the fall of Anakin Skywalker.

Sad and dark, It didn't give that feeling you get when a movie ends and it has a happy ending (But we knew that before hand). ROTS was well done in every way, visual effects, answering all the questions from the first Trilogy. Only a few things I would have done differently or added, was1) Anakin officially going to the dark side was too sudden; the dialogue could have been a bit extended.2) 2) I would have liked to see a few lines of dialogue between Vader and the Emperor, as they look on to the construction of the Death Star, and discuss their plans for the future. (After all, there is 19 years between ROTS and A New Hope episode IV)Visuals were kick butt, Yoda was excellent.  Portman & Christensen didn't have hardly any chemistry in either Attack of the Clones or ROTS, but I guess us Star Wars fans will let some wooden acting slide by.  Seen it twice and can't wait for the DVD.My favs are in order:1) The Empire Strikes Back ( Epic)2) Revenge of the Sith / Attack of the Clones (Both had best action scenes and visuals)3) A New Hope (Classic)4) Return of the Jedi (Not a fan of the Ewoks)5) The Phantom Menace ( It dragged in the middle, and the Gungans weren't interesting.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3PPXVR5J6U2JD	"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien"""	"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith is the third and final chapter of the prequel to what was supposed to be a nine part series.  Confused yet?I remember my father telling me that I'd be 27 by the time Lucas finished all of his films (I had just finished watching Return of the Jedi).  Well, good ole George didn't quite achieve that vision, but with his last installment he comes awfully close.Since it's technically in the middle of two series, there are few secrets left here.  We know that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid, reprising the role he last played in 1983!) will become the Emperor.  We know that Anakin (Hayden Christensen) will get really messed up and become Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones, once again uncredited as he was in the original Star Wars film).  And we know that Padme (the lovely Natalie Portman) will bear Anakin twins, who must ultimately be separated and hidden from the Emperor.But we don't know the details, and that's how Sith brings it all together.  The three prequels finally hit their stride with Revenge of the Sith, culminating in what made Star Wars great.It's FUN.I can't emphasize this enough: The first two movies were less appealing because we had no ""normal guy.""  Everyone, from Luke and Leia to Anakin and Padme, conduct themselves with deadly seriousness.  Somebody has to lighten the mood. The prequels suffered precisely because there was no ""normal guy's"" point of view, calling the Force malarkey and otherwise rolling his eyes at the ridiculousness of a guy in a dark suit.Fortunately, by the third film Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) has evolved enough to crack jokes.  His give-and-take with Anakin is much more natural than their disapproving exchanges in the Attack of the Clones.The film delivers just about everything and answers every question.  If there's a fault, it's that it crams all this in a little too quickly.  Anakin's descent into the Dark Side happens very quickly and the excuse for doing so seems a wee bit lame.  Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) does indeed go out fighting, but not in the fashion I had hoped.  And we finally get an explanation as to why everyone thinks an old shriveled guy with yellow eyes in a robe is ""normal"" for a political leader.R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) kicks some druid butt, Yoda (Frank Oz) kicks some serious Sith butt, and C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels) and Jar-Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) are blessedly mute (a few lines and no lines, respectively).  The Force doesn't just get used, it gets abused.  And we love every minute of it.The animated series of films titled ""Clone Wars"" is a must see for fans who want to know what happened between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith.  It introduces General Grievous (Matthew Wood) and explains what happened to all the hot female Jedi.As a parallel for modern events, Sith has many parallels.  The leader who uses war as an excuse to come to power; the return of religious fundamentalism under the guise of a secular government; the repression of another religion under said government; and the willingness of a republic to hand over its ideals of democracy to achieve peace...even at the price of their own autonomy.Padme has little to say, but her lines are very quotable: ""This is how Liberty dies - with thunderous applause."" And ""What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?""Star Wars as a political tract?  In the 70s, the Empire was seen as a parallel for Communism.  In the 21st century, the Empire is...US.This is the goriest of the films.  Light sabers lead to their inevitable conclusions: the loss of life and limb.  Anakin's downfall is particularly gruesome, which earned this film a PG-13 rating.Revenge of the Sith isn't the greatest of the Star Wars series, but it is by no means the worst.  If you can look past the cheesy dialogue, contrived romance, and the fact that Chewbacca doesn't do much besides stand there, this is the best of the prequels.Congratulations to George Lucas.  He bowed out of the Star Wars with grace...but I still recommend watching the original three movies first."	5.0	Fantastic! But watch the original 3 first	2005-05-23	2	2	0

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3D9KO6R1JB845	Michael Sloane,Tempe,Arizona,United States of...	"Revenge of the Sith is an awesome movie. Easily the best of the prequels,Revenge of the Sith is a well told emotionally intense movie. Of course,the special effects and visuals in this movie are beyond awesome. And the final battles between Obi-Wan and Anakin and Yoda and Darth Sidious are epic. But this movie also succeeds and succeeds better than Attack of the Clones because it has a better story and more emotional punch. This is the story of how Anakin becomes Darth Vader and that is well done. The story of how Palpatine seduces Anakin is well well portrayed. We see Palpetine prey on Anakins insecurity and power hunger to slowly bring him to the Dark Side. A key moment in the film occurs when Anakin is not granted the rank of Jedi Master. You see how Anakins reaction to this shows his weaknesses and sets him up for Palpetine. Once Windu arrives to arrest Palpetine,whose true colors are revealed and Anakin makes his final choice,the rest of the movie is epic. There are several action packed fantastic battles and they are all outstanding.  This is a very emotional intense movie. You can feel the angst of Padme,Obi-Wan,even C3PO as Anakin's turn to the Dark Side destroys all their own relationships and nearly wipes out all the Jedi. I cried when Obi-wan said ""You were my brother Anakin! I loved you! And of course John Williams score was a huge plus. Granted the General Grevious scenes were overdone,but this is still a great movie. 5 stars easily for it's epicness,emotional intensity,and awesome visuals and effects! :)"	5.0	Epic tragedy	2013-08-02	3	2	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ	"Michael W. Kennedy ""insane book lover"""	Influenced by all the hype, I looked forward to watching STAR WARS EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITHS. Boy, was I disappointed. I know this DVD is an Amazon Editor's Choice and has sold gazillions of copies, but inside of ten minutes of viewing REVENGE, my brains were starting to pour out through my ears. This film is for prepubescent teenage boys; I can't see how anyone else could take this childish drivel seriously. Disgusted, I turned the movie off rather than waste my time. For good (adult) sci-fi flicks, try BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN and maybe FIFTH ELEMENT or DUNE. I couldn't help but feel sorry for fine actors like Samuel L. Jackson and Natalie Portman who must have been paid sacks of the King's gold coin to get them to agree to do THE REVENGE OF THE SITH. They sold themselves to the dark side. Don't you.	1.0	MY BRAINS WERE POURING OUT MY EARS	2006-01-12	46	28	18
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AW99SBGWEXP0J	Michael Zuffa	"*** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ***The series started in 1977 is finally completed with ""Sith"".  It is no secret what happens -- Anakin becomes Darth Vader, Darth Sidious becomes Emperor, the Jedi are killed -- the bigger questions are why and how.  George Lucas manages to tie up enough loose ends to satisfy, and ""Sith"" is one of the better films to bear the name ""Star Wars"".The movie opens Obi-Wan (McGregor) and Anakin (Christensen) attempting to save the kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine (McDiarmid) from Count Dooku (Lee).  Not all is as it seems, and soon the Jedi have their eyes on Palpatine.  They fear he will prolong the war to retain power.  Meanwhile Anakin is having nightmares of Padme (Portman) dying.  Soon, Darth Sidious is taking advantage of both these situations to acquire a new apprentice in Anakin by promising unlimited power.""Sith"" is not a happy movie.  The film is darker in tone than every other ""Star Wars"" movie that has come before it, and the PG-13 rating is well deserved.  Fortunately, that is what most fans want.  There is loads of action from beginning to end, including the long light saber battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan and another battle between Darth Sidious and Yoda.Unfortunately, the movie is plagued by the poor acting that has been evident in the previous prequels.  The only standouts are Ian McDiarmid and Ewan McGregor.  McDiarmid is both reserved and dignified, and over the top evil as necessary to the story.  He is the glue that has held the prequels together, and has lent some class to the acting.  McGregor looks and sounds more like Sir Alec Guiness, and his pain in palpable when his best friend betrays him.The effects are astounding.  Every inch of the screen is filled with something to see, all the time.  The story really delivers as well.  Filled with lots of tie-ins to the original series, ""Sith"" really bridges the gap between Episodes I-III and Eposodes IV-VI.My biggest complaint is the appearance of the dark attired Darth Vader.  The whole movie leads up to this point, and what we get is a bit disappointing.  Comparisons to Frankenstein are not entirely off, and that is not a good thing.In the end, it is a heck of a ride, and a fitting conclusion to a series that has captured the imaginations of many for 27 years.  Lucas has said that he will not make Episodes VII-IX, but only time will tell.  Until then, we have a complete tale of the rise, fall, and redemption of one of the biggest villians of the 20th century.  I highly recommend seeing this film and all the ""Star Wars"" films if for some reason you have not.  Thank you Mr. Lucas."	5.0	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith	2005-05-25	3	2	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ANAYSRE3LX8GZ	Micheal Hunt	I have not enjoyed Episode one or Phantom menece very much. I hated the over kill of the CGI being used.However this one has some ok CGI work in it. The CGI didnt make me wanna puke in this one. Only a few times did I see something that I thought looked really un-realistic and crap.The movie starts off with action right away. And the action continues on for about 15 minutes. It is interesting, exciting and looks good. Even the ideas in the charactors I thought where a good go.To be honest, I can't remmber much of the middle of the film. I'll have to see it again to remember it.I did get a bit nitpicky about a few things. But this is a review, not a spoiler so i'll keep them to myself.The movie was alot better then I expected. Most of it ties in well and completes the 2 trilogys of the saga. I think i do like it better then the first 2 star wars, but they don't hold torches to the original trilogys.	4.0	Better then I expected.	2005-05-20	2	1	1

(don't know why it won't let me give five stars--technology issues I guess!!!)I am quite humored by all the fussing and bickering about us getting all excited about this movie coming out.  I sure look forward to it!  Why not be happy about something, for goodness sakes!  Do we have to be grumping around all day?  Isn't it enough that we have to go to 9 to 5 jobs without having guilt trips laid on us for saying horrrayyyyyyyyyyy Episode III is coming out!  yeeeehaaaaaaaaaaaaa *so the Millenium Falcon soars into hyperspeed*  I am both a LOTR fan and a Star Wars fan and have to say that the music for both these movies has been what has inspired me in my own music project.  Go, John Williams!  Keep making your awesome majestic music!  Of course I realize he didn't compose LOTR music---but that awesome quality of soundtrack music for BOTH movies----wow!Now I'm not going to go as far as to say ""I am a Jedi"" but I do feel that there are so many valuable teachings and lessons in each scene that gives us a lot to ponder on.  I have heard of Star Wars changing the lives of people in many ways.  It serves not just as a good adventure movie but also as therapy and even as a teaching.  Many of Yoda's lessons come out of the mystic traditions of the East and George Lucas does a great thing to introduce this into the modern media pop culture as many people are seeking the peace of mind in this fast paced busy society.  As we watch the conflicts that Anakin goes through to become Darth Vader, it is so easy to relate to the wounded part of ourselves that each one of us is trying to heal--Anakin wanted so much to share his gifts with others but somehow felt unencouraged by the Council even though he worked hard to prove himself--this could relate to the frustrations we face in daily life when we strive to be this larger than life person and be all that we are able to be.  There is a part inside all of us that wants to be noticed and acknowledged---Anakin went about it the wrong way in the end---and Luke was able to stand up for what was right even when it was difficult.  Luke represents the hero we would like to become while Anakin represents the darkness that can overcome us when we don't heal ourselves and just suppress ourselves.  Okay now I know some of you are saying oooohhh no man!  We wanna be cool and bad like the Sith and all that--but I mean in reality.  We love Star Wars and LOTR and other great movies because there is a part inside each one of us that seeks to be ""greater than life""  and so the stories in which a simple character is called to a big mission are stories that touch the deepest part of us calling to something very real inside us.So those of you who want to rant and fuss---well if it feels like good therapy for you, then I guess you should do it---but do you honestly think that Star Wars fans are gonna say about your posts, ""Oh my gosh!  That person said that STar Wars sucks and that George Lucas is making a lot of money.  Hmmm  I better sit down and think about this!""  ~chuckles~  Do you honestly think that any Star Wars fan is gonna say to you, ""Well, cheez, thanks for poiniting out the errors of my thinking!  I'm gonna change now and not watch the prequels anymore!  Oh goodness someone said the prequels are terrible so I'm not gonna watch them anymore!""  *smile*  So for those of you who want to cheer for Episode III, I'm here to add my cheers to the crowd.May the Force be with you---our restless society REALLY NEEDS it!"	5.0	Star Wars-Episode III, Revenge of the Sith	2005-04-05	17	7	10
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away ...Only five months into the year 2005 and the North American box office already finds itself in dire peril. Though a scant three films this year have managed to gross over one-hundred million dollars at the domestic box office alone, all but one has made less then forty million dollars in its opening weekend (Hitch grossed forty-three million in mid-February). All eyes were fixed on the first weekend of May, the official start of the summer season, in the hopes that it would resurrect the discouraging box office numbers. Sadly, Kingdom of Heaven kicked the season off with a catastrophic thud, failing to pass even the dismal twenty million dollar mark in its opening weekend. The fate of the domestic box office now lies on the shoulders of George Lucas and the final installment of his galactic cult saga, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, to save the movie industry from utter ruin. Although the fates of the other summer releases are unclear at this point in time, one thing is for certain - should Episode III make less then seventy million dollars this weekend, the box office will officially be dead.The story for Revenge of the Sith successfully ties up all the loose ends which were left in place from the preceding entries in the series, though at times all too copiously, and brings to a head the saga's enduring message of hope, one which has been present throughout the entire franchise, in one final climatic enterprise. Though not necessarily the fault of writer/director George Lucas, far too many courses of action which take place within this film, particularly the scenes in which Yoda is shown fleeing into exile and Obi-Wan Kenobi destroys General Grievous, felt forced into place due to Lucas' obligation to the original Star Wars trilogy. This is certainly not a negative quality to the film mind you. However, if Lucas has chosen to film the episodes of the Star Wars saga in order, instead of producing the prequels years following the initial release of Return of the Jedi in 1983, it may have turned out better. And finally, let us end the discussion here and now - George Lucas can not write a decent script to save his own life. The dialogue, not only within the script for Revenge of the Sith but throughout the entire prequel trilogy, is excessively dry and overtly spiritless. The basic framework is evident. The problem lies in the script and the strings of dialogue within them that stand out the most in the prequel series.Hayden Christensen, who was vigorously slapped around by the critics for his impassive portrayal of young Anakin Skywalker in Episode II - Attacks of the Clones, demonstrates dramatic improvement in his performance. Christensen wears his raw emotions on his sleeve from the very begging of the film and they only intensify further as Anakin spirals down deeper into the black abyss of the Dark Side of The Force. Unfortunately, as vibrant a performance as Christensen gives in Revenge of the Sith, numerous questions remain unanswered as the final credits begin to roll. Though he eventually catches onto Lord Sidious' devious plot, why does it take Anakin so long, especially with the events leading up to their confrontation, to realize that Senator Palpatine is the Lord of the Sith? Why does Lord Sidious give Anakin the name Darth Vader? What does it mean? What is the significance of the mask and suit which are chosen for Darth Vader? There must be more to it then the simple meterosexual mitigation that they color coordinate. Following his final transformation into Lord Vader, why does Anakin not pursue either Obi-Wan Kenobi or Master Yoda near the end of the film? These are probably middling inquiries but they at least deserve some sort of explanation.Natalie Portman is elegant as always in the role of Padm&eacute; Amidala, the senate representative for the planet of Naboo as well as the secretive spouse of Anakin Skywalker, though she is quite noticeably more complacent with her character then before. However, the underlying problem with her character, beside the flaky dialogue she is given opposite Anakin Skywalker, is the audience's lack of emotional attachment with her, particularly when it becomes evident that Padm&eacute; may very well be the cause of Anakin's turning to the Dark Side, unintentionally of course. Then there is her arrant indecisiveness based on her view of the Senate and the Galactic Republic. In Episode II - Attack of the Clones she was positively gung-ho on the concept of democracy and the Republic, then, for some reason (perhaps the hormones acting up from the pregnancy), she questions Anakin as to whether they are on the wrong side of the fight, practically urging him to turn against the Jedi. Then, as soon as the Republic is reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, she moans about how liberty is destroyed with the sound of applause. It is either one or the other. There are downsides to every choice we make, choose one and stick with it. And although there is no indication in either of the two previous installments in the prequel series that the concept of time existed, it becomes flagrantly obvious in Revenge of the Sith. Padm&eacute; starts out in the film with barely a bulge in her stomach announcing the pregnancy to Anakin and by the end she has already given birth to twins. Wow, nine months just fly by, don't they? This is not to say that the development of the pregnancy should have been slowed down in any way, but perhaps Lucas should have centered the events of Episode III on the final trimester of Padm&eacute;'s pregnancy rather then incorporating all three stages in one sitting.Rumors early on in production indicated that Gary Oldman, who is well accustomed to playing the villain role in a blockbuster film and therefore was quite the natural choice to act as the voice of the most formidable and accomplished swordsman in the galaxy, but he dropped out of the project once he caught wind that Lucas was using actors that were not members of the Screen Actors' Guild, which he is apart of. This was quite unfortunate as Matthew Wood, the Lucas Film Ltd. employee who filled in for Oldman once he quit the project and gave a performance so commendable by Lucas himself that he was made the voice of General Grievous, does not sound the least bit intimidating but comes off more like a drunken Soviet with a cold. While on the subject of General Grievous' cough which is frequent throughout his time onscreen, unless you happen to have familiarized yourself with the Star Wars - Clone Wars cartoon series, specifically the final chapter of volume two, you won't grasp why this is happening. And as graphically intricate as General Grievous turns out to be in Revenge of the Sith, the scene in which he pulls out four lightsabers in his battle against Obi-Wan Kenobi is truly a sight to behold, we don't get to see as much of him as we would want and the way in which he goes out is a bit insulting to the reputation which is built around him.British thespian Ian McDiarmid finishes out his role as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who is actually the Dark Lord Sidious in disguise (a very simple one at that), with dazzling flare and style. There was only one aspect within his performance that was a bit of an annoyance. After defeating Jedi Master Mace Windu and with his face distorted from the blowback of his dark energy beams, his voice changes along with it. But the confusing part about this is that it fluctuates from one octave to the next, back and forth throughout each scene he is in from that point on. Whose idea was it to have the character performed that way, Lucas or McDiarmid? While on the subject of the Dark Lord Sidious being deformed, why is his face altered to begin with? If it was caused by the blowback from his dark energy beams then why was Mace Windu, Yoda, or even Luke Skywalker in Return of the Jedi not deformed as well? And speaking of the Jedi, with as simple a disguise as Lord Sidious had throughout the entire prequel series, which involved nothing more then removing a common black-hooded robe from his body, how could they not sense that he was the Dark Lord of the Sith? In the two previous chapters of the Star Wars saga, Jedi Knights, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, and Mace Windu among them, make exclamations of sensing disturbances in The Force, but they can not sense something less then a few inches from them? What good is this `omnipotent' Force if you can't tell that the Dark Lord of the Sith is standing right next to you?Overall, though the dialogue was certainly lacking in the areas of drama and wit, George Lucas did pen the script himself after all, and all too many events which take place in the film felt forced due in part to their place within the continuing Star Wars saga, Revenge of the Sith remains the true turning point for series creator George Lucas' grandiose galactic fable, securing its rightful place as the best of the prequel series and the third best film within the entire six-part saga. The visual effects imagery which allows Revenge of the Sith to appear as particularly vivid in color and scope as it is is nothing short of spectacular and demonstrates a tremendous improvement on the part of the artists at Industrial Light & Magic. True, the Clone Troopers remain a consistent problem for the Star Wars special effects artists, but they aren't nearly as bad or as noticeable in this installment as they were within Attack of the Clones, and so it isn't quite as difficult to forgive this time around.But as unequivocally as Episode III turns out to be, there remain however areas within its framework which still stand in desperate need of retooling from writer/director George Lucas. The first area of concern is over the death of Padm&eacute; Amidala which is admonished on her unwillingness to continue living after having her heart broken rather then the true cause of her demise, this being strangulation from her husband, Anakin Skywalker. The whole `broken heart' scenario is so remarkably clich&eacute;d that it can't be taken seriously and therefore lacks emotional effectiveness in carrying out the end of the picture. Another area of relevance lies in the final transformation of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader. First off, in pulling together all the footage of Darth Vader shown within the television advertisements and trailers and you essentially have the amount of screen time Vader has within Revenge of the Sith. Lucas' marketing department may have over-hyped this aspect of the film a little bit more then they should have and if someone goes in expecting to see a lot of Darth Vader, they are going to be sadly mistaken. And finally, in conjunction with the idea that a few too many actions which take place in this film are forced into place due to the events which unfold in the original Star Wars trilogy, the confrontation between Jedi Master Yoda and Lord Sidious ends all too quickly, giving off the sense that Yoda surrendered quicker then he should have.In spite of these setbacks however, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith delivers the goods its legions of cult followers have long been waiting vigilantly for since Lucas' announcement of the prequel trilogy in the late 1990s. With the epic saga at last complete, the focus of the series has now shifted from the quest of Luke Skywalker to become a Jedi Knight like his father before him and rescue the galaxy from the clutches of the evil galactic empire to the hero's journey of Anakin Skywalker, his descent into the abyss of the Dark Side, and his eventual redemption at the hands of his son. True, it is a concept that fails to enliven the imagination as much as the direct triumph of good over evil in the original trilogy did, but reflects a certain truth of life that it invigorates us to become better individuals, so we may not end up like Anakin Skywalker.	4.0	The Moose Hole - Rise Lord Lucas!	2005-05-21	3	1	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3R36DZQEWNVJ1	Mike Bolts	What comes out of George Lucas' Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge Of The Sith is the better then Episode 1 and 2...especially number 2. Here, we still have that stiff speech but what makes up for the speech it the action although a gargatuan amount of us know what happens by the end. The lighsaber duels are fun especially the last one with Obi Wan Kenobi, played by the always great Ewan McGregor (upcoming The Island, Young Adam) and Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, played by the miscast Hayden Christensen (Shattered Glass, Life As A House) on the lava planet...duking it out with each other to see who comes out on top. Mace Windu, played by Samuel L. Jackson (XXX 1 and 2, Shaft) comes to a tradgic end as he's blown out a window after giving Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious, played by Ian McDiarmid (Sleepy Hollow) a taste of his own powers to his face making it ugly. Yoda, voiced by Frank Oz (who also is a director), is too terrific here. We get to see Chewbacca and his home planet...cant pronounce it. We get to see Padme Amidala, played by the lovely Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer), birth too twins named of course, Like and Leia...though Portman didnt give a good performance while giving birth. There's a very short lived part by Count Dooku, played by the great Christopher Lee (Lord Of The Rings Trilogy), who meets his end by getting decapitated by Anakin. Also, there's a robot badguy with a human heart and wields four lightsabers called General Greivous, voiced by Matthew Wood, who meets his end by the hands of Obi Wan. By the end we get to see how Darth Vader got his badass attire that we all love after he had a date with some molten lava and getting his legs burned off. I was excited when they put the mask on and we hear that ohh burr sound and I was excited when he was propped up....but what the hell...I was totally disappointed when Vader cut loose of his shackles and screamed NOOOOOOO..I was totally ashamed...but hey, I we get to see the start of the Death Star, which was good and how Luke was taking to Tatooine with Obi Wan looking after him and how Leia was brought to The Organa family....Jimmy Smits (Tv's NYPD Blue, Running Scared) was Bail Organa, who wasnt bad...how Yoda went into exile and so on and so forth. Another good but bad thing...the good thing is that Jar Jar Binks is barely in here but the bad thing is that he didnt die....damnit George Lucas!! EMPIRE is still the best of the bundle...of course adn this one isnt that bad but it certainly is much better then ATTACK OF THE CLONES was by far. You decide...I just right my opinions here..you can disagree or agree with me but I keep my insight....peace out	3.0	Revenge Of The Sith..............you be the judge	2005-08-07	3	1	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A15K988ZLGP65K	Mike Dugan	"I'll admit it.  I went into this movie with a knife and a fork.  Frankly I had rather substantial problems with the other two Star Wars prequels, which is really quite a shame.  What really bugged me was how Anakin was generally portrayed in the previous chapters.  Episode I strangely shuffled Anakin off to the side for a large portion of the movie, then Episode II just made him out to be just too much of a hothead.  I was always disappointed by how he and Obi-Wan just didn't seem to get along in, ""Attack of the Clones,"" as well as Anakin not seeming very formidable in combat.  I used to love it in the original films when old Ben told of how Anakin was such a good friend and a powerful Jedi.  Personally I think this was really crucial stuff.  If this Anakin guy was so terrific, then good heavens, his fall from grace must have been hugely tragic and heartbreaking for those around him.  Naturally I would think making Anakin out to be as fantastic a person and Jedi as possible would have been top priority.  The first two films in this series, however, just never conveyed any of that to me, as I would have liked.  In fact, there were many moments where they actually proved the negative.  It bothered me for years, and as a result, I came to this movie ready, willing, even anxious to hate it.It was foolish, but then it was hard not to be in such as state after being so disappointed with the previous installments.  Of course, when the big moment finally came and I could actually see the movie for myself, it's hard to convey with mere words the shock of seeing Anakin display such prowess in battle and such affection towards his master.  What a delight.  Anakin tears up battle droids left and right as if they were nothing, he pilots his starfighter with such skill that I'm sure even Han Solo would be jealous, and even the fierce Count Dooku was no match for him when it came to a one-on-one fight.  Go Anakin.  Plus, it was such a great moment when Anakin valiantly hoisted his unconscious friend and mentor Obi-Wan after he had been clobbered by the wicked Count.  In fact he saves him on a few other occasions as well.What really brought a smile to my face was, after the very impressive opening sequence, when Anakin and Obi-Wan returned from their adventure, Obi-Wan slathers his former student with all sorts of praise for his deeds.  Not only was it all well-deserved in my opinion, but it actually referred to things that Anakin had actually done on-screen.  I never liked how, in, 'Attack of the Clones,"" there were these moments where characters would simply talk about some amazing action Anakin had taken at some other point in time, while I, the audience member, got the shaft and instead saw Anakin get bested during nearly every action sequence he participated in.  It drove me crazy.  But now, in this third and final Star Wars prequel, when Obi-Wan spoke of Anakin's great achievements, it was of events that I had just seen for myself moments before.  I could finally think, ""He's right!  That was cool!  I liked that too!"" instead of, ""Gosh, that must have been something.  I wonder what that was like.""  Oh, and the cherry on top?  Anakin graciously credits Obi-Wan's teachings to his success.  Finally, some warmth and friendship between these two.This really was the Anakin I had been seeking.  Now don't get me wrong.  I never expected this depiction of Anakin to be the first thing I saw once, ""The Phantom Menace,"" came out.  Luke wasn't a Jedi right off the bat either, but at least he was a good person with a big part in it all, and he did *amazing* things.  Anakin's first appearance in Episode I, however, just gave him merely a supporting role as a little kid, then in Episode II, well, he just didn't seem like a nice person or an effective Jedi to me, nor did he seem to like Obi-Wan.  He should have at least bore some semblance in those movies to mighty Jedi Knight he is in this chapter.  That would have helped the flow of this whole trilogy for me immensely, and I feel it would have synched up nicely with old Ben's tales of Luke's father back in the original films.  Well, I could go on and on about how I was unhappy with some things in other two episodes, but I'm just going to talk about this one, and enjoy it as well.First, on a slightly superficial note, I really liked the battle sequences in this movie.  A lot of movies these days have fantastic effects and great battles and all that, but this movie really nails it.  All the imaginative and different weapons and vehicles clashing throughout the movie, not merely for ambiance, but for instilling a sense of action and adventure was just what this trilogy needed.  I also thought the sheer variety of different Clone Troopers, with their varying colors and customizations to their armor depending on what planet they were on, was just really cool.  The same can be said for the myriad of bizarre droids the Separatists use when battling the Republic's forces.  This movie does a fantastic job of portraying the excitement, danger, and thrill of an elaborate science fiction battlefield, both in space and planetside, and I think George Lucas and his colleagues should be incredibly proud of what they've accomplished here.  I think that's important to a movie like this.  I mean, here I am going to see a movie with the word, ""WARS,"" in big, glorious golden letters right there in the friggin' title, and lo and behold, there's a war going on in the movie.  Good grief, what a concept!  And thank god for it too, because the other two prequels were starting to make me think this series should be renamed, ""Star Occasional Skirmishes,"" or something like that.People criticize George Lucas a lot these days for, ""overusing,"" digital effects, and I think that's baloney.  I think the issue was, at least with regard to the first two prequels, he didn't use it enough.  The action felt way too sparse to me in the other two chapters, and there were plenty of moments characters just stood around and talked about something, when I felt an action sequence would have gotten the point across much more thoroughly.  But now, in this chapter with the fabled Clone Wars in full swing, things just get better and more exciting, and it really hearkens back to the greatness of the original trilogy.  Honestly, the real saving grace for this movie in my opinion was the fact that, with a galaxy-spanning conflict going on, there were far greater chances to get across the fact that Anakin was indeed a great warrior and friends with Obi-Wan.  I think the opening battle sequence proved just that.As for deeper, less special effects-heavy aspects of the movie, I have to say, I also found Anakin's weakness that lead to his transition from Jedi to Sith quite fascinating.  Basically what lead to Skywalker's tragic downfall was fear.  The fear of losing his beloved Padme was too much for him to bear, especially after his mother was brutally torn from him by the putrid Sand People of his homeworld.  As we all know, fear is indeed a huge part of the Dark Side, and the scheming Palpatine played off Anakin's Achilles' heel perfectly.  I also loved it when Anakin went to Yoda for advice on the subject, because it was just like old times when Yoda would utter these brilliant speeches that were chock-full of wisdom.  ""Do or do not, there is no try,"" is a phrase from the original films that has gotten me through many hard times in my life, and now in this newest installment, Yoda wisely explains the pitfalls of attachment that can hurt us all.  It wasn't until I saw this movie that I realized that I myself suffered from such issues as well, and we all have to learn to let go of certain things in life, tangible or otherwise.  It was really quite extraordinary.Though, while I'm embarrassed to admit it, I did initially find fault with this part of the story and philosophy.  At first I was rather taken aback by the idea that Anakin's attempts to save the life of a loved one was what led to his turn to evil.  How could trying to help someone you care about be such a heinous thing?  Aren't Jedi supposed to help people?  Most of all, as I recall it was his effort to save the life of Luke that signaled Anakin's turn *away* from the Dark Side in the original trilogy!But wait.  Think for a moment of Anakin's speech as he met with Palpatine in the theater.  He spoke of the Sith being selfish and thinking inwardly.  Then, when he swore his allegiance to Palpatine's teachings much later, he claimed he, ""couldn't live without,"" his dear Padme.  He didn't turn to the Dark Side to save her for her, but save her for himself.  Anakin never considered Padme's horror at his contribution to toppling the democracy she devoted her life to.  He just wanted his own needs fulfilled, which is thinking like a Sith.  He deluded himself into thinking he was doing something good for her, thanks in no small part to Palpatine's poisonous advice, but really he was just behaving like a tyrant.  He even turned on her and lashed out when she expressed her anguish at his actions.  Yet when he saved Luke's life in the original trilogy, he willingly sacrificed his own life to do so.  That was when he realized what the right thing to do was.  He saved someone he cared about not for his own needs, but for the needs of that very person he cared so much for, even at the cost of his own life, which is the real Jedi thing to do.Finally, I also liked the movie's story.  I liked how Anakin was torn between his allegiances to the Order and the Republic and how confused he was when those who he answered to, who were at first on the same side now plotted against one another.  He had friends on both sides, in the forms of his wise fellow Jedi, and the grandfatherly Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.  Anakin seems to have grown very close to the Chancellor in this chapter, which contributes to his loss of faith in the Order.Both the Order and Palpatine try to use Anakin as a pipeline into the each others' workings, yet Palpatine is far more graceful about it.  He makes it public that he wants Anakin to bring him news on Jedi affairs, makes no secret of his wanting Anakin to be his representative on the Council, dressing it up as an act of goodwill for his friend and soon-to-be apprentice.  The Jedi, however, clumsily try to covertly send Anakin to Palpatine's side as a spy, which seems far less honest than Palpatine's more candid gesture.  It's not hard to see why Anakin's trust in the Order would be weakened, whilst his loyalty to Palpatine would be strengthened.  It's evilly brilliant schemes like these that make Palpatine such a formidable nemesis, and I love surreptitious foes like this.I've got to come clean about some things here.  This part of the story, as interesting as it was, did have some flaws in my opinion.  Mainly the fact that Anakin refers to Palpatine as a friend and mentor in a way that implies it's been that way for a long while.  Yet I saw very little interaction between Anakin and Palpatine in the other two chapters.  There was some, but nothing that would make me believe they had this deep-rooted friendship.  At most I got the feeling in the earlier prequels that Anakin liked Palpatine to a point that made me think he'd vote for him come the next election, but not much else.  It's a flaw that drudges up the problems I had with the other two episodes, which is to have a character talk about something, yet not show me anything.  I only thought of Palpatine as a friend and mentor to Anakin *after* he spoke of it, not before.  Though, do be fair, there are moments in this movie that do depict them as friends and have Palpatine in a mentoring position.  Case in point, the aforementioned appointment of Anakin to the Council, by Palpatine.  Hey, that was a nice thing to do, on the surface at least.Now I have to come to the unpleasant part of my review, which is pointing out the problems that I sadly saw within this movie.  As much as I liked it, I did have some issues with it.  Hey, no movie is perfect.  Aside from a few gripes I mentioned earlier, there are some bits to the prequel mythos that always bugged me.  I never liked the idea of there being a prophecy, nor do I care for the concept of Midichlorians.  Those things don't mesh with the ideology of the Force as I know of it.  Why would Jedi adhere to a prophecy, a foretelling of the future, when they're so disciplined with staying in the moment?  Like how Yoda berated Luke for looking to the horizon too much.  Jedi keep their mind on where they are, and what they're doing, not some far flung prediction of events yet to pass.  All we have is now, and that's all we'll ever have.  A prophecy just doesn't jive with the Jedi way.  What's next?  Creator gods who figure prominently in the ways of the Force?  No, it doesn't work that way.  There's the Force, nothing else, plain and simple.The same goes for Midichlorians.  The Force is supposed to be something mystical and intangible, not determined by the contents of your body's bloodstream or something physical like that.  Remember what Yoda said:  ""Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter!""  Besides, if Midichlorians really are so pivotal to one's connection to the Force, that would basically mean something as simple as a blood transfusion or the loss of limbs could *hugely* effect that person's powers.  The Force shouldn't have anything to do with what condition your body is in, it's about your spirit.  You don't judge Yoda by his body's size, why should you judge someone by what's in their body's bloodstream?Those criticisms can be applied to the prequel trilogy as a whole.  This movie by itself did have some issues which I feel need to be mentioned.  While I hate to be another one of those folks who points at the acting as being a problem, since it's not as big a deal as some people think it is, it is a problem.  What really bothered me from time to time in this movie was how characters would give these puzzlingly ho-hum reactions to really major events as they occurred.  One that really got me was, after returning from rescuing Palpating from Dooku, Anakin and Obi-Wan are basically met with a golf clap.  The general attitude upon their return was, ""Well hey, good job guys.  Dooku's dead and the Chancellor is safe.  Let's move on, shall we?""Can you imagine if, at the end of, ""A New Hope,"" after Luke returned from destroying the Death Star, everyone just smiled politely, patted Luke on the shoulder and said, ""Nice job, kid?""  No, instead everyone went nuts!  They were ready to throw a party, and rightfully so!  It gave me a reason to cheer too.  There should have been the same such reception upon Anakin and Obi-Wan's successful mission in this movie's first act.  Everyone should have been exhilarated to know that the leader of the Republic was safe, the wicked Count Dooku was no more, and the evil Separatists were finally on the run.  Plus, having such happiness at the beginning of the picture would've provided a really stark contrast to the sad ending.  There were other moments throughout in which characters just shrugged and muttered in response to major stuff like this too, but that's the one that stands out the most in my mind.Plus, and this was a big problem I had, I really can't believe how little screen time Darth Vader had in this movie.  Before this movie came out, there was a staggering amount of ads and publicity images parading Darth Vader's likeness.  There were even some such images showing Vader brandishing his iconic red lightsaber in a dynamic attack pose.  After seeing all this, I think I had every right to expect, even rely on there being another one of those terrific battle sequences I spoke so highly of earlier with Darth Vader at the center of it.  What could have been more cool than seeing one of the most recognizable villains in cinema history marching into battle in an all new feature, backed by the fantastic modern special effects that this movie utilized so well in so many other ways?  It would have been fantastic to see Vader and a huge phalanx of Storm Troopers trudging towards an army of surviving Jedi in a newer Star Wars story.  Instead, all I got was Vader lurching off the operating table and a few other shots of him standing around with his evil master, and that was about it.  Basically, if you've seen him in the trailers, you've seen him in the movie.  I'm still a little outraged.  Plus I think it would have been very interesting to have Anakin really embrace the name Darth Vader more overtly during the movie.  Maybe if he angrily corrected Obi-Wan during their duel on Mustafar, claiming that he was no longer Anakin Skywalker, that would've spoken volumes to me.One more thing, the idea that Anakin and Padme having a child being such a huge taboo never sat well with me too.  I found it pretty disturbing that the impending birth of Luke and Leia, two of the greatest heroes in the Star Wars universe, could very well have lead to Anakin's expulsion from the Order.  I never thought it inappropriate for a Jedi to start a family.  One of the things that Luke had to do to achieve Knighthood at the end of the original trilogy was forgive his father for many things, one of which was not being a father to he and his sister all their lives.  That was such a huge part of the mythology, so why then is Anakin's impending fatherhood in his movie such cause for concern?  Maybe if it had been the fact that Anakin is a Jedi, *and* Padme a Senator being the reason this union was so inappropriate, that would have sat slightly better with me, but that's a big maybe.  As it stands, I wasn't cool with the idea of a Jedi starting a family being such a terrible thing.  Hey, at the end of, ""Return of the Jedi,"" Leia started to feel her Jedi powers kick in, and she confirmed her love for Han at the same time, which has clearly blossomed since.  She was a Jedi, and her love life turned out just fine.  Jedi being in love and having kids shouldn""t be a problem at all.Well, I guess I have a pretty even balance of praise and criticism for this movie.  I still had a better time studying it than the other two prequels.  Plus the things that I am willing to praise it for are quite good to say the least, and I strongly encourage anyone out there to see this movie.  Rent it, Netflix it, heck, buy yourself a copy.  I did."	3.0	Now this was enjoyable.	2005-08-08	1	1	0

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A25LSNKTK8W9O3	Mike Renzulli	I have been a Star Wars fan since being blessed with seeing Star Wars IV: A New Hope in theaters during the 1970s and have seen every Star Wars movie in theaters since.While I love all of the Star Wars films, I think that Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is the second best of all six. Despite the sometimes weak dialogue, the acting is good; the action is nail-biting (especially the lightsaber duels); the special effects are top notch and it is good to see how each of the events from Star Wars I & II all come together setting the stage for the adventures of Luke Skywalker.All of these movies are a testament to George Lucas' genius and I would hope that he would reconsider his decision that Revenge of the Sith would be the last Star Wars film and make three more episodes that take place after the fall of the Galactic Empire or prior to Star Wars I where the Jedi and Sith origins are shown including the origin of the Galactic Republic.I have a feeling that if this episode does well at the box office, Lucas may make more Star Wars films after all. I was also glad to see that Lucas mostly stuck with the original origin of Darth Vader too.I had read about Vader's origin in Science Fiction magazines prior to Episode V being released and the setting for Kenobi and Vader's duel is somewhat modified from what I read, respectfully.Otherwise, I highly recommend this movie too for its (what I consider to be) indirect political statement which shows not only Anakin's final embrace of the dark side of the Force but also how a republic can be twisted into an empire like what has happened to the United States.May the force be with you!	5.0	From Republic to Empire	2005-05-20	7	5	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1FG91CM8221X1	Miles D. Moore	"""Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"" is by far the best of the most recent trilogy of Star Wars movies, and it is certain to satisfy all the fans of the series. George Lucas creates a mostly plausible explanation as to how and why Anakin Skywalker--proud, ambitious but essentially decent Jedi knight--becomes the despicable Darth Vader. Not having to carry the expositional weight of ""The Phantom Menace"" or ""Attack of the Clones,"" ""Revenge of the Sith"" gets right down to business with what everyone goes to see ""Star Wars"" for--ever more spectacular special effects, and ever more spectacular fight scenes. The ultimate light-saber duel--between Anakin/Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi on a planet of seething magma--ranks among the most breathtaking one-on-one battles ever recorded on film. (Even R2D2 gets to kick some serious butt in this flick.) Yet despite the obvious glories and outstanding entertainment value of ""Revenge of the Sith,"" I hesitate to give it a fifth star, and I also wonder whether it's the best of the six Star Wars movies, as some critics have claimed. The reasons are simple: as a writer of dialogue, particularly romantic dialogue, Lucas makes James Cameron look like Billy Wilder, and as a director of actors he's only a little more adept than Edward D. Wood Jr. The computerized-animatronic Yoda seems a hundred times more alive than Ewan McGregor, Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman or even the usually superb Samuel L. Jackson. Among the human actors, only Ian McDiarmid manages a real performance, as the delightfully evil Chancellor Palpatine, a/k/a Darth Sidious. (At least Jar-Jar Binks is limited to a non-speaking part in a couple of crowd scenes.) Also, to serve the plot of the original three movies and explain why the Jedi are nearly extinct by the time Luke Skywalker comes on the scene, Lucas is forced to write himself into a corner: he has Anakin/Vader commit one particularly heinous crime which I will not reveal, but which is unforgivable even considering Vader's ultimate redemptive act in ""Return of the Jedi."" ""Revenge of the Sith"" by far is the most masterful of the Star Wars films in terms of action and special effects, yet I prefer the warmer humanity and greater humor of the first two films, ""A New Hope"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back."" If you're susceptible to the Star Wars saga at all, you'll like ""Revenge of the Sith,"" and chances are you'll love it. But rent ""Trainspotting,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Closer"" or ""Shattered Glass"" as a reminder that the actors here really can act."	4.0	Brilliant in some ways, mediocre in others.	2005-06-02	4	2	2

They after all, were the original target audience.  The movie ties up the plot without large glitches.  It is reflects the storyline of the large number of not so good books that my older son reads over and over again.  It has lots of action and a little real graphic gore in the end of Anakin's life as a ""pretty boy"".  They both left the movie happy and satisfied.It was a different experience for me, their over 40 mother.  I have seen the movie twice and am considering going for a third time.  I have such a sense of loss that the world created by the movies will not be given to us again.  ""Revenge"" has faults but it transports me, disturbs me and provides an experience of art that seldoms happens.There have been books that when I finished I wanted to meet the (usually long dead) author.  The desire is to actually connect with the soul of the individual creator.  Stars Wars is a product of the movie factory environment requiring the collaboration of many individuals.  They and the movie deserve a lot more positive credit for their success than they are getting.A movie that can provide a 12 year old with a great night out and make his mother consider the nature of mortality and legacy can't have much wrong with it."	5.0	Mourning the end of the epic	2005-05-27	2	0	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"The last of the ""Star Wars"" prequels, this is the episode in which we get to see how the cocky young Jedi Anakin Skywalker is ""seduced by the dark side"" and transformed into Darth Vader and how twins Luke and Leia Skywalker are born to Senator Padme Amidala but come to be raised apart, knowing very little of their parentage. ""Revenge of the Sith"" provides an awkward prologue to the original trilogy, but unfortunately does nothing else. As the film opens, the Republic is still at war with Imperial forces. Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is held captive by droid army General Grievous, and General Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) set  out to rescue him. Anakin and Padme (Natalie Portman) are keeping their marriage a secret in spite of expecting a child. But Anakin's premonitions of his wife's death awaken in him feelings of desperation and lust for power.""Revenge of the Sith"" is essentially an animated film. The vast majority of what we see onscreen is computer generated imagery. We are basically watching a handful of actors running around inside a computer game. The CGI doesn't look realistic in any way. It is clearly animated and has trouble matching the depth of field to the sets and actors. The script vacillates between screwball comedy and melodrama. Half of the scenes are completely superfluous. Padme has become dim-witted and passive. Her childbirth scene might be the worst in cinematic history. The film's many battle sequences just bog it down, because they are so cartoonish and repetitive. It's about as thrilling as watching someone else play a video game. George Lucas' insistence on bloodless war in which the enemy is a droid army -whose lives and opinions therefore have no value- is insulting.But ""Revenge of the Sith"" does manage to generate genuine dramatic tension when Anakin converts to the Dark Side and Jedi all over the galaxy are eradicated. Apart from that, we have a film that is trying too hard to tie up lose ends and not trying at all to be good at anything. If George Lucas had hired a scriptwriter who could write dialogue, a competent director, cut a half hour from the film, and used some green screen effects instead of CGI, he would have had a much better film -and one with a modicum of credibility. In truth, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is better than Episodes 1 and 2 because it has a smidgen of substance. But beyond that, it suffers from the same problems as the other prequels. I still remember vividly the action sequences and images from Episodes 4-6 that I saw over 20 years ago. I can only remember bits and pieces of Episode 3's action a few hours after I saw it. It just goes to show that improved technology doesn't necessarily mean increased impact or credibility -even in an action film."	3.0	Essentially an Animated Film.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1WYENJ1QI2S7I	"mitch ""mitch4406"""	This last Star Wars film (although 3rd chronologically) wraps up the Stars Wars saga in great fashion. We see the climatic events that happen a few decades before the original Star Wars from 1977. The film opens as a great battle in space has already commenced. Obi Wan and Anakin Skywalker are piloting small attack ships in the midst of hundreds of ships. They are attempting to rescue the kidnapped Chancelor. This scene is amazing in it's detail. You have to watch many times to catch everything.This film is the darkest of the Star Wars films. Anakin, as everyone knows by now, will embrace the dark side of the force. But one does not convert to the dark side for no good reason. Anakin is deeply conflicted. He has learned a great deal under the tutelage of Obi Wan but he is still sorely tempted to use his powers for vengence, not justice. The script delves fully into all of this. It also delves more fully into the honor code and dedicated training regimen that all of the Jedi's live by. This is summed up by Obi Won when he confronts a Anakin that has just committed horifically evil acts. Rather than state the obvious and accuse or blame Anakin for these heinous acts he apologizes for failing to mentor him properly. Prior to watching this I had read many reviews that mentioned it's possible unsuitability for younger aged kids. My 8 and 10 year old sons watched it loved it. And the film presented many positive talking points for my kids.	5.0	Lucas wraps up great saga with fine film	2006-04-25	4	3	1

In this latest incarnation, however, unless the national IQ has dropped dramatically, this film is really not for mature adults looking for a good escapist rolicking time. It is juvenile and with the exception of Ewan McGregor, the acting is mediocre for the most part. Worst of all, the plot is only marginally interesting.If you enjoy laser-sabre fights, there are many. Too many. There is a lot of hyperactive jumping around with fancy athletic backtwists, too, if that is your cup of tea. If you enjoy special effects, they are spectacular.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AU1ROWBIOKX7X	M. Leister	"I was born 2 years after Star Wars first hit theaters so I basically grew up with it.  While Sith isn't as good as the first 3 movies from the 70s and 80s, it is the best of the prequels, perhaps because it is less planet-bound than episodes 1 & 2 and because it answers most of the questions the original trilogy left.I know there are those who panned Attack of the Clones, and it does have it's flaws however, those who hated the love story aspect are those who will say Anakin had no good reason to go bad in Sith and miss not only the big emotional pull of the third movie, but what truly causes the conflict between good and evil in Anakin.Anakin truly loved 2 people in his life:  his mother and Padme.  He lost his mother and vowed to beat death.  He says Padme is all he lives for and pulls himself from lava to get back to her because he thought she was still alive.  If you fail to see how much he loves her (ie: those who still whine about the wooden dialogue in Episode 2) you will miss both the less stilted wording of Episode 3 (yes it is much better and I saw this in a crowd mixed of kid and adults and no one laughed or groaned) and the inner conflict Hayden Christensen so aptly emotes when Anakin kneels the emperor vowing to do whatever he wants if the emperor will help him save his wife.  Anakin is a man divided between losing himself and losing what he loves most.  He elects to lose himself and loses everything.  That is the crux of the movie and the heartbreak.  This film with it's dramatic irony is a Greek tragedy for the modern age, we all know what is coming, but alas those on the screen can't hear our words of warning.My only complaint about this film is that Padme's fate was so altered from what the original trilogy illuded to.  If you forget the recent DVD boxset and look at the unaltered originals, in Empire Vader knows Luke is his son, but didn't seem to care until he became a threat, it was Leia's existense that was a surprise to him in Jedi.  The new DVDs were changed to coincide with Anakin's belief Padme died on the landing strip before birthing their child.  However this change leaves a hole in the continuity of the story line even if you take the DVD release as the ""correct"" story line.  In Jedi, Leia tells Luke she knew their mother ""who died when she was very young"" leading me to believe that in Lucas's original concept, they took Luke, who Vader knew about, to be guarded by Obi-Wan and sent Leia away with Padme who at least got to raise one of her children for a few years before giving her over to adoptive parents.  Padme's new fate makes more sense for if she lived, Anakin would have sensed it and pursued her with Vader's possessiveness to drag her back to his side when he no longer had use for her, but the mystery of Leia's comment still leaves the series with one unanswered question.All in all, see the film.  If, like me, you liked the love story as much as the action, you may want to bring an extra tissue.  Padme's death isn't heart wrenching since you semi-expect it, and we see Vader's reaction to is not Anakin's, but it still pulls at your emotions to know the sweet boy of episode 1 who grew up to marry the woman he worshipped is not only his own ultimate destrcution, but hers as well."	4.0	The best of the prequels and the saddest	2005-05-22	6	4	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2UL0A8GJB4318	mljkb	"Though you are going to have to wait for it.  After slogging through two prequels that nearly tarnished the image of Star Wars for good, Lucas gets his act together and comes up with a film that brings some quality to the prequel trilogy by being the first film in the trilogy to be worthy enough to bear the Star Wars name.  The film starts off fine, as Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and OB1-Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) engage in a massive digitized space battle to save to save the life of Chancellor Palpatine (the deliciously evil Ian McDiarmid).  Anakin is forced to kill Count Dooku in the process leaving separitist baddie General Grievous to get away and land a gigantic starship safely on Courescant.  Once everyone is safe, Anakin meets up with flame Padme (Natalie Portman) who reveals she is pregant.  George Lucas still has the gaping flaw of not being able to direct a love scene and a fair number of times Christensen and Portman look blank, though their performances and scenes are worlds better than the soggy ""Attack of the Clones.""  But that is of little concern when OB1 heads off to kill Greivous (a terrific villian) in a stunning lightsabre battle, Yoda leavs to aid the Wookies and Palpatine begins to spring his plan to take over the galaxy by luring Anakin to the dark side, who fears Padme will die in childbirth.Even though Lucas shows  good improvements early on, the feeling of the film is still stilted, mostly because of clunky dialouge that Lucas still thinks sounds decent.  ""Sith"" still lacked the rush of ""Star Wars.""  But then it all changes.  You could almost pinpoint the exact moment.  Once Palpatine kills Mace WIndu (it's not like I'm giving anything away) and his face changes into the pale, deformed vision of evil, the film sparks and comes to life.  Palpatine is the true villian of ""Star Wars"" and McDiarmid chews into the role with zealous glee. His spine-tingling performance and frog-like voice will send chills up your spine.From then on, ""Sith"" feels like the original trilogy.  In short, the magic was back as Anakin and Palpatine begin their systematic destruction of the Jedi and Yoda, Palpatine, Anakin and OB1 take to climatic lightsabre fights in the galatic senate and the volcanic planet of Mustafar, all set to John Williams amazing score, that somehow explores eerie, nightmarish corners of ""Star Wars"" that were yet untouched.  Though these sections of the film still have their share of stunted dialouge, it becomes of little concern.  Overall it feels you are really watching ""Star Wars"" again.  And to cap it all off, Darth Vader returns with a menacing aura, his first breaths surreal and scary.  And once Luke and Leia are born, the ""Star Wars"" saga is brought full circle.  ""Revenge of the Sith"" is imperfect and flawed, but it does send the series off right, redeeming the prequel trilogy and adding the legend of a galaxy far, far away."	4.0	Lucas Finally Recaptures The Magic	2005-05-29	6	2	4

But you might catch yourself constantly praising the performance of one character throughout the entire series. It's that of actor Ian McDiarmid a.k.a Chancellor Palpatine a.k.a Darth Sidious a.k.a the Emperor. (Geez, this guy's got more nicknames than Apollo Creed!) He is the one character who has consistently had the best dialogue (""We'll be watching your career with great interest."") And he has had the richest character development of any besides Anakin Skywalker. Palpatine/Sidious is the classic ""wolf in sheep's clothing."" The revelation in Sith & his final transformation into the Emperor is actually handled slightly better than Darth Vader's. What made him belivable was how he approached Palpatine to begin with. Palpatine had a genteel, unassuming presence about him undermined slightly by his extremely pale appearance. I think he won loyalty in the Senate because he wasn't a true politician. He presented himself with an air of diplomacy and authenticity that he used to rail against the ""stuffiness"" of the Jedi. When his true identity comes into light it's actually very startling even though we know its coming. The Palpatine character was able retain fluidity in a series known for its unevenness.As for Darth Vader, I had some problems with his ""first steps"" scene and I could have wished for dialogue better suited to his classic character than the ridiculuous shaking and ""NOOOOOO!""

However, that is faint praise indeed.  Consider that ""Return of the Jedi"" has more character, depth, and feeling than Episodes I & II combinded and you see what I mean.The opening set piece in this action-drama is thrilling and in the greatest traditions of Star Wars.  Sadly, the film slides a bit from there.  There are moments of billiance.  Yoda, I kid you not, is a revelation as a CG character, amazing stuff.  And, Ewan McGregor is having more fun than anyone else in the entire series of prequels has had.  Ian McDirmand, provides, at times, some true and insidious acting fun.However, the film suffers most, again, at the hands of its creator.  Lucas still writes dialogue that is dead.  He cannot direct actors well, even good actors.  Nearly every actor in a major role in this film has produced good or very good work with other directors.  Some are able to work above Lucas's deficencies (McGregor or Nesson, being prime examples), most of them are not (I mean, look at Samuel Jackson).Lucas has often said, with the advent of CG, he can now produce any scence he can imagine.  Well, that's a problem, because it leads to creative overdrive.  George, sometimes, less is more.  Letting the effects serve the story isn't a lesson that Lucas has learned yet (though he does do better here than in the first two movies).Putting this in the context of all six movies, I'd have to rank it slightly behind ""Jedi"".What a disappointment the entire prequel series has been.  Such lost opportunities.  I am, perhaps, being unfair viewing it through the lens of the originals, but I cannot do it any other way.  Lucas created a standard that could not live up to with his aging talents and blind-sides to storytelling.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3F1RS18J88FD5	M. Morris	Does he ever! Of course, almost everyone already knew that Anakin Skywalker has to become Darth Vader. This movie shows how it happens. Anakin and Padme are secretly married, and Padme is pregnant. Anakin starts to have terrible nightmares that she will die in childbirth. Meanwhile, he is becoming more and more frustrated with and alienated from the Jedi. Chancellor Palpatine, who is really the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, preys upon these facts, and eventually convinces Anakin to turn into Darth Vader. Now it is up to Obi-Wan to hide the young Skywalker twins, Luke and Leia, from their father. In an ironic twist, Anakin's evil efforts to save Padme are what ends up killing her. No doubt, you will be eager to watch or rewatch the original trilogy after seeing this movie. My advice as always, is: Don't hesitate!	5.0	Another Sith Lord Arrives in Episode III	2009-01-15	4	3	1

It was fun, exciting, and was truly the missing piece in the Star Wars puzzle.  I have been a Stars Wars fan since I saw episode IV in theaters almost 30 years ago.  While episode IV is still the best, this film is a clear 2nd best of the six films.While the visual effects were excellent and the action was riveting, I most enjoyed the storyline.  I knew where the story had to go, but it was done in such a way that it was interesting all the way through.  One big positive was that there was almost zero Jar Jar Binks (who was the biggest mistake George Lucas made in the whole series).Hayden Christensen did a great job as Anakin Skywalker.  That character was the key to the whole movie and critical to the entire series.  I had some doubts as to how he would perform, but he proved he could meet the challenge.  The other actors did very well, although I thought that Natalie Portman was a weak link.  They made her look more like someone from today, which means that she looked just like Natalie Portman.  I was never able to forget who she was and enjoy her performance.  However, I must admit that after seeing her in ""Closer"", I've lost almost all respect for her.All in all, this movie was everything I hoped in would be."	5.0	A Strong Finish to a Great Film Series	2005-05-25	7	4	3

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2ANC9Z50PIS0D	Mom	Something about entering a theater causes a suspension of disbelief. Yes, I laughed out loud in the theater at some of the worst lines ever delivered on celluloid, but watching the DVD at home I could only groan.There were some golden moments in Star Wars, the original movie, and even its two sequels. These moments were due to the fact that Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, James Earl Jones (who has about two minutes in this movie), Alec Guiness and even the much maligned Mark Hammil had some talent for acting, and decent material to work with.In Revenge of the Sith only the returning actors are even passable. Yoda, voiced again by Frank Oz, is by far the best thing in the movie, followed closely by Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor.That there are only two minutes of James Earl Jones, by the way, means that there only two minutes of Darth Vader. Of course, Darth Vader is the most popular character in the series, and the one who adorns the most licensed material. Almost thirty years after the original Star Wars,  this is all we get?Finally, the DVD shows that some of the better scenes seem to have been deleted. Perhaps they wouldn't have fit in with the overall low quality of the rest of the movie, but perhaps a little leaven would have raised the tenor of the whole.The bright side of Revenge of the Sith is the special effects, which are astounding, and the music, to which Star Wars has always owed a great deal of its success.You cannot however have an even passably good movie without any good acting. Anyone who enjoyed Star Wars will want to see this once, and only once. Pass on owning the DVD.	2.0	It is even worse on DVD than it was in theaters	2005-11-10	11	6	5

If you're a Star Wars fan and have 1st, 2nd, ___ 4th, 5th & 6th episodes on DVD already; Like me, then you'd be silly not to buy the 3rd and finish your collection!!I'm also looking forward to seeing the deleted scene that will be on the DVD version. Maybe the deleted scene might help some people; like those who didn't understand why Padme had no back bone & turn to mush. Gee her husband was changing to the dark side & saying things she didn't want to hear. Anyone who has been in love will tell you; That when the person you loves changes for the worse, it will turn you to Mush and make you cry and it has nothing to do with being pregnant. So maybe the deleted scenes might make it more clear for some people.Despite whether the story line was weak or strong doesn't matter, the main reason for getting this DVD is because you get to see WHY Anakin puts on the black suit!!!

A New Hope (Episode IV)3. Revenge of the Sith (Episode III)4. Return of the Jedi (Episode VI)5. Attack of the Clones (Episode II)6. The Phantom Menace (Episode I)I am even going to say that Episode III should be mentioned in the same sentence as the original trilogy. It sets up A New Hope nicely and has much improved acting over the last two films. Hayden Christensen has improved big time and is actually quite good (thank the maker!), but CGI Yoda, Ewan McGregor, and Ian McDiarmid offer the three strongest performances by far. I can't help but feel a little let down since this will be the last Star Wars film and because of some lame dialogue & acting (good thing Natalie Portman is smoking hot), but it could have been a lot worse...right?

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2XVA2OGDYKKD	Monsieur Valentine	Not until the final minutes of star wars episode III, does it become apparent the enormity of the task for George Lucas these last few years.As the final moments saw Darth Vader rise to the occasion, it dawned on me... the parallel to Lucas stamping his authority and marking his redemption. How fitting, the sound of Dah Dah Dah da da Dah as it pounded through the 5.1. surround system.Lucas not only faced a colossal hype, but he also had to deal with the expectations of a cult following (grown up after 20 years) and the demands of a new audience (more desensitized and experienced). Having to retain a nostalgic euphoria whilst incorporating technological advances. And at the same time bridging a story in a changed society.All the while, science fiction itself has matured, playing host to a higher I.Q.And as Darth Vader awoke to a confronting camera, revealing `old school' green and red buttons across his chest, the dilemma at hand was apparent. Not to bridge a story, rather to bridge an old world with the new. The task was enormous, and I feel, George Lucas has come as close as anyone could.The scripting in this final episode, has vastly improved, specially between the two lovers. Natalie Portman's experience in other movies (Closer) was clearly apparent, giving one of the strongest performances. Hayden Christensen (Anakin) paled in comparison, struggling to portray a man in turmoil. Admittedly, Star Wars has never been about performances, but without a Harrison Ford character we somewhat lose the human feel in the prequels.Where this episode shines, ironically, is during the darkness that prevails. It's a refreshing tale (surprisingly) of a hero succumbing to the powers of evil. The story goes well to change the Anakin into a Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid (the Chancellor) does well to convince Anakin of the dark side. The chancellor insists that good-evil can be very subjective. The idea Anakin falling to the dark side is very believable (even though I find it hard to swallow the idea someone can be drawn to a faction that calls itself the 'dark side'). It gives new meaning to the villain, a complexity that is not like Hollywood to embrace. The sound of Darth Vader breathing is more chilling to hear than ever before.The cinematography is phenomenal at times. The artwork was gorgeous, landscapes of futuristic skyscrapers, high mountains, lava waterfalls. All quite breathtaking, however, at times I felt like I was looking into an aquarium, a slight blur when the camera was in motion, focusing intermittingly. The CGI was wearing a bit thin, specially when the characters did flips, it was obvious when the CGI kicked in... the picture blurring, the actors morphing. The fighting sequences like many recent epic movies was hard to grasp. There were too many cutscenes, and all I could see were light sabres tossling.The sonic range of the sound effects was a bit frustrating, I was squinting every time a spaceship jetted away or blew up. In fact I would go as far as saying, that the action sequences were not as rewarding as the story itself. The action in Epsiode II was more sporadic but also more entertaining. I would compare this episode with Empire Strikes back.If you really think about it, the prequels will never live up to the originals. But I think, other than episode I, George Lucas did a pretty impressive job of completing this 6 piece saga.(insert: Closing credits here)	4.0	Star Wars - Episode III - Revenge of Lucas	2005-05-20	8	5	3

I would more accurately give this 3.5/5 but close enough to round to 4.The problem I had with this film is the acting. I didn't expect this to have Oscar-status acting here (even with Samuel L. Jackson) but there were a couple pretty ""corny"" parts. The one that really sticks out to me was when Darth Vader is finally created and....SPOILER....he realizes his wife is dead; he walks up and screams, ""Noooo!!!"" That was kind of lame acting and lost the intensity of the finally seeing Darth in full form.The visual effects, I thought, were obviously excellent. Very well done CGI work.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A251HGUJFL9F14	MovieMayhem	"When I saw ""Sith"" in the theaters I had never seen the first two (or should I saw 4th and 5th?) movies in the series, Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. I was a huge Star Wars fan growing up even though the first one premiered the year I was born. I was convinced nothing could be as good as the original films I watched growing up. I was roped into seeing revenge of the Sith by a few friends and enjoyed every minute of this action-packed flick. When i returnued home after the movie i went out and rented ""Clones"" and ""Phantom Menace"" and i thought they were mediocre compared to this ultimate climactic film which I think might very well be my favorite of the whole series. A few complaints I have about the film is of Annakin's descent into darkness. His demeanor changed it seemed almost at the drop of a hat but his romantic scenes seemed to have improved since the Clones movies which were mediocre at best. The cinematography was superb and I am not a sucker for such frivolities usually but upon watching the original films I was more sympathetic with Vader's original plights and his love for Padme. I was very impressed with ewan MacGregor and Hayden Christensen but Natalie Portman's portrayal of Padme throughtout the series had much to be desired  including overall talent. The screenplay seemed uncoordinated when she spoke and did not convince me of her love for Anniken or love of democracy. Her acting hit an all time low in the first film when was announced herself as the real Queen Amidala and was probably at its best when giving birth-which really says something. Comic relief was little to be had in this movie so if you are looking for a lot of comical quips from C3PO you are out of luck. Fortunately this did not affect the movie but made it better. I felt that 3PO's quips in the first two movies were awkward, forced and ruined any scene's integrity and I was glad to see his part in this final film as certainly peripheral.And once the credits rolled at the conclusion all the pieces came together for me and assured me I would appreciate the whole of the movies in a new way"	5.0	And now it all comes together...	2005-06-24	4	2	2

This one did it to me no less than four separate times.Particularly noteworthy is the ""Order 66"" montage when all the Jedi are being killed.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AB7W3IO5V7CT0	moviewatcher	"The movie saga that has spanned almost four decades comes full circle with the latest George Lucas offering. ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" was not only an ominous story but, unlike its predecessors, it also received a PG-13 rating. ""Sith"", however, delivers on punch, story, action and much more.The story of ""Revenge of the Sith"" starts a few years after the end of ""Attack of the Clones"". Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), now a general and a member of the Jedi council, and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) have been fighting in the Clone Wars. When the film starts, their mission is to rescue Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) who is in the clutches of General Grievous (voice of Matthew Wood, coughing by George Lucas) and Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). After eliminating Dooku and rescuing Palpatine, Grievous escapes, leaving the group to crash land their ship on Coruscant. This is all in a day's work for the Jedi!Shortly after arriving on Coruscant, Anakin is reunited with Padme (Natalie Portman), who he secretly married in Episode II, and it is revealed that she's pregnant. Anakin, however, grows increasingly distressed because of nightmares he has that show Padme dying in childbirth. During this time, his alliance with Palpatine grows, which concerns the Jedi Council, especially Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), who is convinced that there's more to the Chancellor than meets the eye. When Palpatine appoints Anakin as his representative on the council, the young Jedi is eager to prove himself. However, his ego takes a hefty blow when the other Jedi, while allowing him to sit on the council, refuse to give him the rank of Master.Afterwards, Obi-Wan, in an attempt to track down General Grievous, is sent to Utapau while Yoda travels to Kashyyyk to confer with the Wookies. Anakin, in the meantime, becomes distraught when he realizes the true identity of Palpatine but is convinced that he is the key to saving Padme. How will Anakin's decisions ultimately effect those closest to him?""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" had a lot to live up to. The movie had to answer a number of questions in order to provide a smooth transition to the first movie, ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"". The film did just that for the most part.Most people expect to be dazzled by lightsaber and battle scenes and ""Sith"" does that as well. The final battle on the lava planet of Mustafar was exceptional. ""Sith"" also delivers several compelling, gut wrenching scenes. It even gives the person watching the film an almost sympathetic view of Anakin's fall to the Dark Side of the force.The acting was far better in ""Sith"". Ian McDiarmid's performance as Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious/Emperor was one of the high points of the film. The character was subtle, manipulative and pure evil all rolled into one. It was also good to see him in action instead of sitting, half hidden throughout the film.For those who are only familiar with the movies and not the books, a few things could have been added about General Grievous' background to relay how dangerous he was perceived. Yoda leaving for Dagobah would have been a nice touch as well. (This scene is supposedly featured in the deleted scenes on the DVD.)With a solid, well paced plot, special effects, lightsaber battles and the rise of Darth Vader, this is the ""Star Wars"" film fans have been waiting for. ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" is the perfect ending to the beginning."	5.0	Perfect Ending to the Saga	2005-05-19	3	2	1

Plummer ""mkp"""	"I went to see this movie because it was on the cover of TIME,and everyone said it was better than the last two, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I loved the original series, but was disappointed in ""Phantom"", and didn't see ""Attack of the Clones"". So my expectations were not high.  First off, most reviews I read of this movie said that the acting was bad. Hayden Christensen especially got a lot of bad reviews.  Not true.  Christensen did a wonderful job, as did everyone else in the cast.  The dialog was not stillted, and the love scenes between Anaken and Padme were beautiful.  Any dialog taken out of the context of the movie and written on a page (espeically the dialog between Anaken and Padme) may sound silly or strange, but in the context of the movie, it fit perfectly.  The acting was great, the love scenes were wonderful (yes, Lucas can write a love scene), Christensen nailed the transition from Jedi knight to Darth Vader.  Some of the most wonderful parts are when Anakin, after being relentlessly wooed by the emperor, finally decides to go to the dark side. After killing a Jedi knight to save the emperor's life, Anakin cries out ""Oh God, what have I done?"" In his fateful decision he is resigned to his fate, and does not go gleefully.  The final duel between Anakin and Obe Wan, when Anakin is scared and left to die on the lava flows, and shouts to  Obi Wan ""I Hate You!""  ""I failed you"" says Obi Wan.  It is a beautiful scene.  It is the human element, and the human failures and tragedies which saves this movie.  By contrast, the new technology available to todays' filmakers leaves me cold. The light saber battles, and all the other overdrawn battles with sabers, giant lizzards, robotic evil generals, etc. just got to be too much, and pointless.  I used to love the fighter space ship scenes in the original films, but the opening rescue mission of the film left me confused about what was happening, and the plane angles and shots left me dizzy.  I plan to buy the DVD so I can fast-forward through all that crap, and get to the good stuff.  Christensen is a great actor -yes - and was nice eye candy as Anakin Skywalker. Natelie Portman must be one of the most beautiful women in the world. They looked lovely together.  It was as shame, however, that Padme' role in this film was mostly decorative and not one of substance.  But the tenderness of the love scenes between these two was pataible.  I am puzzled by the varying degrees of reaction to this film.  But I think the actors deserve more credit.  Without the technology crap going on, this is a great film and deserves recognition as such."	4.0	Don't Listen to Negative Reviews!	2005-05-30	8	4	4
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3I9NRWJU6CKRF	mptesteroni	"Get your ""No-this-review-made-me-angry"" button flame-fingers ready, space spazzes--  This is the $185-million dollar Plan 9 From Outer Space of 2005.  Any comparisons to the original trilogy are completely unfair, because those featured characters you wanted to see win, lose, or get redeemed.  This did not.  In fact, George Lucas is mad at his viewers for caring about the people of Star Wars, and uses Yoda The Wise to admonish us by preaching that caring about anybody is the road to Hell.  Really?  I guess we all might as well just shrivel up and die then, George.  Those mitochlorian bugs you killed Zen with are the thrill you feel from the aquisition of Almighty Money, which is your Force now.  What made me think Yoda was so damn wise when I was 10 is beyond me now.  Probably my belief that Grover taught me things too.  How dare Lucas hide behind this once-beloved character, now revealed as simply a little green puppet, to pontificate on the dangers of power and greed.  No mirrors at Skywalker Ranch these days, the Emperor wears no clothes and all his editors and screenwriting assistants were cast out of the Temple to float away in the garbage smasher with the rest of the garbage a long time ago, in a galaxy blah, blah, blah.You see kids, the true Star Wars (1977) was brilliant because it portrayed you and me, young boys from nowhere with stars in their eyes, who were small and powerless but crafty and tenacious against the overwhelming and merciless powers that be in a big, wide, uncaring universe.  So powerful was this age-old construct that you felt something die inside you when even the least of Rebels, like big fat fighter-jock Porkins, bought the moisture farm playing necessary diversion in a tiny fighter over a man-made small moon which busted whole planets.  That's all been replaced, and so criminally superceded by, this white whale of a tale of one hopelessly inefficient and clueless political monstrosity being replaced by another, colder and more hopeless one.  If C-SPAN 2 were owned by LucasFilm I suspect it would turn out just like this mess, and that I would want to watch it about as much.People who hate these prequels like to point to Return of the Jedi as the beginning of where it all went wrong.  Let me say that for all the lame battle dialog of Admiral Ackbar and fuzzy Mini-Wookie Ewok antics, I'll take the characters from Return of the Jedi over General RoboVlad the Consumptious and Darth ""Noooooooooooooooooooooooo [acting ability]"" Spoiled any day.  I miss freaky aliens that spoke Alien (not badly-dubbed Japanese English), robots that were appliances somebody average could buy that just went ""GONK"" once in a while, and stormtroopers who didn't kill Old Ben Kenobi in that hangar ONLY because they all knew how royally miffed Vader would have been if they'd spoiled his fun, not because they were afraid of Ben's wicked Force-powered deflecting skills.  Ancient weapons and hokey religions did NOT destroy the Empire, or even the Emperor himself... it was blasters, human tenacity and an old-fashioned wrasslin' heave-ho that did all the damn dirty work in the end, but they most DEFINITELY did in the Old Republic, sure enough.  Kenobi knew he was surrounded, outnumbered and OUTGUNNED and chose the Ghandi and Jesus way out; apparently when he was younger he just could have cut down the whole Death Star garrison with his shiny stick!  Balderdash!As go the throwaway characterizations in all three prequels, so goes the lack of tidy story-telling as well.  ""ROTJ"" example:1.) Rescue Han.  Promote to General.2.) Go to Endor, blow up shield generator.  Get a good look at AT-ST's.3.) Take down Death Star II with a whole fleet of whoopass.4.) Kill emperor, simultaneously redeeming worth of evil father through passive example against supposed master.5.) Party at the Teddy Bear Picnic.It's a small story, and boys and girls of my generation could imagine that they could grow up to be one of those plucky rebel commandos or daring pilots.  It's nice and concise.  It's not:1.)  Tie up loose robot-ends by killing the sniffly king robot.(Really?  They're built in totally autonomous factories and we already went through the droid control ship theory, but there's ONE bot who keeps the kill switch for the whole plan, yet has neither the directions to the robot repair shop nor the radar or radios to suspect that people are crawling around in his ship?  How convenient for bad screenwriters everywhere.)2.)  Eliminate a supposedly all-knowing yet hoplessly befuddled Knights of the Round Studio Apartment with convoluted and at the same time agonizingly childish politics, pre-programmed God-knows-when Executive Order and single shots to the back of each supposedly bullet-proof Knight.3.) Drag out a tired old ""You're Schmoopy!"" ""No, YOU'RE Schmoopy!"" stilted, prefab, preteen Sweet Valley High-style romance to justify making some babies we may one day actually like.4.)  Return the naive Queen to the Senate just in time to boo-hoo the death of a democracy that was being ripped apart before her very eyes while she was gallavanting for no reason around the galaxy on a taxpayer-funded secret honeymoon and (illegally) sleeping with it's mightiest protector (who's powers had doubled- DOUBLED- since last movie!  Look Out!)5.) And finally, suffer through yet another fiery yet strangely relaxed and aloof Hollywood videogame CGI snowboard ride of impending yet strangely non-threatening certain (or IS it) death as Annie and  Big Daddy Kenobi surf the wild river of flaming poo that represents the final burning inside my soul of all that ever made me believe in any of Lucas's karma stew in the first place.And what's the endgame payoff?  The grand, final boss-fight cutscene before the credits roll?  We get to see people and ships from the GOOD Star Wars movies!  Yahoo!  You're all clear kids, now let's blow this thing so we can all go home...  Seriously.What a bunch of overblown, ninth grade, videogame cut-scene space opretta, PrattleStar Galactica nonsense.  If this is quality sci-fi film making in the twenty-first century, I guess Tank Girl and Johnny Mnemonic must have been the Citizen Kane and Inherit The Wind of the 90's.I read here that somebody actually cried, CRIED! during this drivel.  You poor thing; don't worry, I'll be ashamed for you.  Crying for the death of Padme and Anakin's ""love"" is to cry for the cord of wood you throw on the coals at a weenie roast.  Cry for the inhumanity of the world, for your dead cat, for the secure knowledge that an extended 3 DVD THX remastering with BRAND NEW ""deleted"" scenes of the masterpiece Howard the Duck must surely be in the works if George Lucas thinks that this movie is his final redemption for what he has done to destroy the only popular mythology of the 1970s and 80s.Oh well, it's his world, let him simmer in it.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A37FC4RI4BC9ZT	"Mr. James Powell ""Paddy"""	The last chapter in the prequel.I thought the first 4o minutes lucas had no sense of where this story was going.It seemed to take flight once Anakin and Palpatine were discussing the path to the dark side.Count Dooku (Christopher Lee's) demise was swift ,he had no decent dialogue and was a very unconvincing villian compared to ATOC.He's a great actor he deserved  more time in this movie compared to the one dimensional general grevious who displayed no threat as a villian the minute he appeared.Palpatine was definately the character who shined throughout this movie and of course the omnipotent and wise Yoda.The light-saber scenes were very impressive and the brutal maiming of Anakin on Mustafar was brilliant-like something out of ''Re-Animator''.This movie has its flaws and it definately lacks the charm which pervades a new hope,empire and ROTJ making it a little stale.However we should be thankful that George made these prequels, we can analyse all we want- these movies are fun and are entertaining.Everyone slated Phantom menace jar jar binks ewans accent.I think Phantom Menace has a lot of charm and i would say Phantom menace and ROTS mirror eachother.Why?One is for the kids the other for the die-hard extremely hard to please fans.Another impressive attribute to this movie was linking it to ANH.Every fine detail from the exile of obi-wan and yoda ,the displacement of the twins,the costumes of the rebels,the scene with the droids on that brilliant white corridor mirrors vaders appearance in ANH on the very same ship.Yes this movie is entertaining and thats what star wars films are supposed to be.Thanks George Lucas.These movies are the reason Cinemas are made.	4.0	entertaining!thanks George!	2005-05-20	5	4	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ACJKE4P1P6M7G	Mr. LP	"First of all, don't get me wrong, I love Star Wars saga. Episodes 4,5,6 are fun, exciting to watch. Episodes 1,2 were not on par with 4,5,6 but are still okay in my opinion. BUT, episode 3 was totally a huge disappointment for me (and my brother, too!). Before the flick came out, I was eager to see how well Lucas would connect the first 2 with the last 3 especially the transition of Anakin to the dark side of the force. After watching the movie, I could say that Lucas totally failed to do it. Or should I say that his explaination did not convince me at all. In my opinion, he should have needed 2 episodes to describe Anakin's transition. The reason for him to join the Sith Sidious was trying to learn the power to save his wife from death. But what's with the sudden cold-blooded killing spree to terminate the whole Jedi race was something way too lame for me. To portrait the wrongdoing of Anakin, Lucas even put some children killing which even made thing weirder.Another huge disappointment was light-saber fights. When Samuel L Jackson lead three Jedi knights to capture Sidious (as Chanselor Palpadine), 2 out of those three were killed almost instantly without a fight. I myself can put up a better fight against an old man like that! Let's talk about fighting style then. It's RIDICULOUS! If you watch closely (even you don't have to) you can see in the duet between Sidious-S.L.Jackson and Anakin-Obi-wan, they spinned too much! If I have to fight a dude with sword and he keeps spinning like that, I will not hesitate to slash him on the back at least 10 times! In the Anakin-Obi-wan duet, those two keep attacking opponent's light-saber in the air! Heck, it'll take forever for a fight if none slash direct to other's body. The jumping of actors were so fake too! Growing as an Asian and watching Hong Kong's sword-fighting series for years, I can say that Lucas should come to HongKong to learn how to make flying, jumping, sword-fighting seem more real without burning his deep pocket. Natalie Portman looked beautiful in the funeral scene tho.Again, I love Star Wars saga, but I expect a lot more than this! Star Wars fan deserve a better one than this! My disappoinment was almost as much as after I watch ""House of the Dead"", which I wish I could kill the director for such a horrible, waste-of-my-time, trash-worthy dvd."	1.0	A lame, high-budget B-rated movie!	2005-11-06	26	14	12
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1NMUSODK9RHAT	Mr. Maybe	Lucas and company have done the unexpected, which was pull off a near masterpiece to salvage the prequels and perhaps the entire Star Wars franchise as a whole among its deepest fans, which I consider myself to be.Technically and visually, this is perhaps the best film of all six. True enough, nothing will take away from the magic of any of the first three, but this film can easily be held in their ranks and in some ways, goes beyond. It's almost a stand-alone film, with only the back-story of the Clone Wars being necessary to fully understand it. It could have easily been the only film of the prequels and been just as satisfying.I'll spare you the plot that so many of you know; what is finally touched here is an emotional understanding within the Star Wars universe, much like both EMPIRE and RETURN OF THE JEDI were to able to capture through the relationship between Luke and Vader. What are captured are many things: a history and deeper portrayal of Palpatine and his rise to power. The pain of Obi-Wan as he watches his apprentice fail. The burning desires of Padm&eacute; to retire with Anakin and their baby to a life of normality, free of politics and code. Lastly, we bear witness to the walls caving in around Anakin in his attempt to maintain balance between the Republic he has been always sworn to protect, his wife and unborn child(ren) and finally his ambition for power to protect all of the above. Plus let's not forget the epic lightsaber duels we could have only imagined until now - Kenobi vs. Vader and even better, Yoda vs. Palpatine.Lucas takes the time to allow the viewer to absorb the events unfolding, to demonstrate the scale of the dark curtain known as the Empire falling and lastly, to show the beauty of the Star Wars universe.Though I would regard SITH as perhaps the most emotional of all six films, it still maintains a breakneck pace of action and sheer visual splendor. He uses elements that have been void of all six films, which only enhance the film's flavor, such as dream sequences, and cinematics that again, allow the viewer to take in the rich environments.The pacing of the film is very well done, far better than either Episode I or II. The stunning visuals, sounds and design are right there with the likes of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and perhaps beyond, because the worlds are all immersive. You're never once reminded that you're sitting on earth in packed movie house. You always remain in that galaxy far, far away.The performances of Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid and (mostly) Hayden Christensen (whose performance did not impress me in ATTACK OF THE CLONES) are standouts, especially McGregor and McDiarmid.I know that I was taken to the first two Star Wars films when I was young, but I only remember going to RETURN OF THE JEDI (I was 7.) This film brought closure to all of the prequels and has now enriched the originals even further. Because in the end, despite such grim events transpiring, you're left with a glimmer of hope that inspires you to root for the likes of Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda (and ultimately, Vader) all over again.Hats of to Lucas and all hands on deck, this is a must see film for any Star Wars fan and even those who have yet to discover its magic.	4.0	Finally a worthy prequel installment that adds great value to this legendary franchise	2008-08-01	0	0	0

I can't even describe the feeling I had as I walked out of that theater.  It was that of pure awe, amazement, extacy, and probably even Nirvana.But I'm not stupid.  I did know from the clues that Anakin was in the Clone Wars, fighting as a Jedi for the Republic, and I did know he was converted over to the Sith under Lord Palpatine, but just finally SEEING it happen was just awesome.  And who knew Yoda had such awesome moves?  Judging from Eps V and VI, I would have never known.	5.0	It made my life complete . . .	2007-11-11	3	2	1

When you think of Star Wars, do you think of critics raving like ""Ewan McGregor is terrific"" or ""Natalie Portman gives a stunning performance?""  NO!  First of all, the acting wasn't the problem... The script was rough around the edges but give me a break, it's Star Wars.  It wasn't that terrible...With that out of the way, Episode III is a fantastic movie and it's a great way to bring the heralded story to an end.  There is all the action you could ask for in a movie and then some.  You'll love the lightsaber fights and starfighter battles.  There is some humor, mostly involving Yoda or droids, but don't go saying it brings the movie down.  Once again, it's Star Wars.The final battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin is proclaimed by most to be the best part of the movie, and rightfully so.  Anakin's eyes tell a story on their own, especially at the end of the battle.I'd also like to point out that John Williams does a great job with the score to this film.  The soundtrack perfectly captures the sad story of a young man falling from glory and losing everything he has.Here's the main point.  If you're going to analyze every aspect of this movie to death, you won't enjoy it.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A10UUPV9A0F1N2	Mrs. B. Lawrence	George Lucas's final offering of the Star Wars saga has finally hit the screens. The third and last  episode of the prequel had to have been the most difficult as it had to make sure that the end fitted snugly into the beginning of the 4th in the series which had been made nearly 30 years earlier. Lucas pulled of this coup with amazing dexterity, leaving no loose ends and leaving a lot of Star Wars fans satisfied with the outcome of the story.The film, a product of the age of special effects spares no expense in utilising all the technology available to it. Larger than life battle scenes and breathtaking planetary vistas holds the audience spellbound. Use of colour and shadow adds to the sense of conflict, both external and internal.The first 20 minutes of the film explodes onto the screen in a panoply of noise, colour, light and movement. If one is prepared to sit through this cacophony, then one is rewarded with a rollicking epic reminiscent of the swashbuckling  heroic epics of the forties and fifties. Thankfully the plethora of action scenes was not as prevalent in this film as it was in the first two of the prequel. Lucas's handling of the storyline was masterful and his reasons for Anakin turning to the dark side was a flash of inspiration. Fans have been wondering for years how and why the transition of their hero from good to evil will be made.Dialogue does become cliched at times especially the scenes between Anakin and his secret wife Padme.Ewan McGregor is a wonderful young Obi-Wan, giving the character depth and substance. His portrayal exudes the exact qualities that Hayden Christensen lacks. Christensen's performance is wooden and stolid. He mumbles his lines and at times seems almost uncomfortable with his role. Having said that, he gives a few memorable performances towards the end of the film, having mastered the intensity and 'evilness' of the haunted figure he is about to become.Other memorable performances are those of Ian Mcdiarmid who reprises his role as the Emperor. Christopher Lee has a wonderful cameo role as the Sith Lord and Natalie Portman is adequate, albeit not memorable, as Padme.It was a film for fans of the series and I wouldn't advise someone with no prior experience of Star Wars to see it, unless they were particularly interested in special effects. But for those who grew up with the earlier films, it will be an experience that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled off the screen.	4.0	Tying up loose ends!	2005-05-23	3	1	2

For example, who was Darth Vader, what happened to all the Jedi, who Luke and Leia are the daughter and son of and more.  i loved it especially because of Hayden Christensen, he might have been a reason most girls saw this movie! He is really hot! This movie was the best ever, besides 1,2,4,5 and 6, and i am looking forward to it coming out on DVD and VHS, and i think they might all be gone considering that this is the last movies of the Star Wars saga.

'Star Wars' meant so much to me when I was a kid that watching parts of this utter train-wreck of a movie were physically painful.  The only reason I give it two stars is....I got some good belly-laughs out of it.The crawl at the bginning looked promising.  War!  Senator Palpatine kidnapped by the evil Count Dooku and General Grievous!  Then nothing happens for twenty minutes.  Twenty minutes of dead time is not good.  After this, the problems just keep piling up. Wooden acting, excruciating dialog.  Padme reduced to simpering wussiness; her man is gone, so she just gives up?  She has two babies! She also belives there's a chance to redeem her husband.  THat's plenty of incentive to stay alive, but she just dies. (a shift I find sexist, by the way).  And no real reason for Annakin to turn-he does because the script says he does. The only saving grace is Ian McDiarmid.  He knows this is silly crap, and he's going to milk it for all it's worth.Oh, George, what happened?  Have your eyes been clouded by greed?  Did you just get bored with the whole thing?  Thinking back on the greatness of the earlier movies ('Empire' is the best) I want to weep.But I did have fun doing call backs inspired by 'The Court Jester'.	2.0	Biitter disappointment	2006-01-04	14	7	7

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AD2ELU7QN8E0L	Musemom	"I gave this one two stars, for I found only two draws.I.  It was far better than the last *ahem* first two.I mean, let's face it: those other two were rembling editorials which made no real addition to the saga.  This one was the only one of the prequel trilogy which gave a large amount of information.  Also, this one made you fell closer to the characters - instead of fealling that you were delving into the Skywalker family album.In the beginning of the movie it again brings to life the characteristic dog fight in space.  The effects were subdued and it just seemed to fit in better with the classic trilogy.Also, you at first find more apathy for Anakin than you did in the other two movies.  (In the first, he was a whiny brat, and in the second he was an adolescent jerk)  He was just nicer, more respectful, and all-around more likable.This is where reason two comes in.II. It was the funniest movie I've seen in the theater for years.As you may have guess from my title, I am myself a mistie.  Thus, my suggestion to all those who wish to enjoy this movie: polish your puns and don't leave home without your sense of humor.Many times I found chances to add my meger wit to the ""force"", the ""mistie colective"".  Examples:  Yoda's Toyota; ""My, Annie! You must have a fever - you're burning up!"" (the Emperor).  [Ok, ok, my sisters thought up those - I had some good ones, but I've either forgotten them or you would have had to have been there to understand]I also saw a great spoof on the web that was running through my mind the entire time - my friends showed it to me, so I don't know where it was.  Sorry, it's most definatly your loss.Other than that, I can only compliment the great acting done by the guy who plays Obi-wan and the cleanliness of the special effects.  I am still overwhelmed by how realisticly setlike they mannaged to make the computer animation - and I'm not being sarcastic.  I really do prefer the old plastic models to today's ""superior"" technology, and the effects team for this movie did a great job at toning it all down.What's left to say?  Well, I tell you tearfully that I shall be absent from the theater for most likly a long time.  Cur?  (Or, for the barbarians among you, ""Why?"") I am disgusted by the lack of intelligence shown by the contemperary media (well, actually, the media in general - but I'll stick to one topic here)  All the movies I saw preveiws for were either sequels, remakes, or embelishments of jokes about married life.I really have no excuse for complaint, however, as I have just seen the FIFTH in a long line of sequels!And are their rumblings of more on the way?

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2L119B70PDKAH	musicfan	"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is a very worthy closer to the Star Wars saga. The action is amazing, the stoyline is fascinating, and the characters are memorable.Ian McDiarmid gave an A+++ perfromance as Palpatine and really brought out the best from Hayden Christensen as Anakin. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi was also excellent as he really looked like a younger Alec Guinness. Also, Samuel L. Jackson performed masterfully as Mace Windu. Christopher Lee does another spectacular performance in his short role as Darth Tyranus, better known as Count Dooku.The action in this movie is absolutely amazing. It starts right of with an action sequence with the Battle of Coruscant, one of the final battles of the Clone Wars. Throughout the movie, the action continues. The lightsaber duels in this movie are absolutely spectacular. I must say that it is truly rewarding to finally see Emperor Palpatine wield a lightsaber.We finally get to see hoe Anakin fell to the Dark Side. The conflict inside of him is growing, and has been growing ever since he killed the Sand People in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. He was falling every since then and was falling all through the Clone Wars T.V. series and all the other time between Episodes II and III. But in Episode III, he is finally tipped over the edge by his distrust and frustartion the the Jedi Council, Palpatine's masterful manipulations, and fear of Padme's unclear future.This is possibly the most emotional movie of the saga with it's contendors being The Empire Strikes Back and/or Return of the Jedi. Either way, this movie will sadden you as Emperor Palpatine/Darth Sidious orders the Clone Troopers to ""execute order number 66"".This is the darkest and most violent movie of the saga, which is why it recieved a PG-13 rating.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2EWC48FRNO3YP	"M. Veiluva ""sputnik99"""	"Watching Episode III, """"Revenge of the Sith"", made me somewhat sad there will not be any more of the series.  The last hour of the film - the only real worthy drama of the entire first three of the Star Wars episodes - reminded me of the skill and sense of clear focus Lucas brought to his earlier Star Wars films (especially V).  There is no chance to reclaim it now, and the amount of sheer waste in Episodes I and II used up gobs of valuable film space for what could have been a more taut, exciting, and meaningful series.  ""Revenge""  is definitely the best of the first three episodes, but that is faint praise considering what Lucas could have produced as he did with IV, V and VI.1.  ""George, you can write this s------, but you can't make me say it.""  (This is attributed to Harrison Ford) .  Ford and cast brought a sense of panache and fun to what was even in the 1980s pretty clunky dialogue.  (This isn't hereditary - Lucas could write very good dialogue, see ""American Graffiti"" and even ""Willow."") Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill weren't exactly Shakespearean material, but they were irreverent and lively, perfectly suited to Lucas' space western.  The same dialogue given to Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman hangs in the air like a lead-plated zeppelin.  The new characters are not having fun - it reminded me of the old ""Space 1999"" series where all the people actually seemed to hate each other and never, never cracked a smile.Humor was the key to keeping the early Star Wars movies afloat, both baddies and good guys.  Stripped away, and the drama is not enough to sustain the series.2.  Character proliferation.  The number of key characters in Episodes IV through VI was actually quite small - indeed, characters that occupied seconds of film space, such as Boba Fett, had to be fleshed out in after-market books and comics. In Episodes I through III, there is an endless parade of forgettable characters that get too much air time and we don't care about - Jar Jar Binks (oh, yes!) and General Grievous come to mind.  This does wonders for action figure sales but nothing for plot.  Lucas left very little to the imagination in his last films, which is what made the early films more enjoyable - we wanted to know more about Jabba and Boba then appeared on screen.  Remember Biggs, Luke Skywalker's boyhood chum?  Had he been in Episode II, we would have seen an hour of him.3.  Battles, battles, battles.  The use of battles in Episodes IV, V and VI was really quite spare - there were no throwaways.  Light saber battles were significant, short, and did not take up three quarters of the movie.  By the time of the climatic battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan in III, it was, ""enough, already"" - the dueling, played to excess already in I and II, ceased to have novelty.Same with the battles in space.  Sure, the effects are thrilling and superior to the older movies, but they lack essentiality and often hang on the screen like ornaments, recalling (this will upset many people) the endless sequences in the first Star Trek movie.4.  Jar Jar Binks.  (But he's not in III, is he???)  I have not forgiven Lucas for Jar Jar Binks, the worst character in a Lucas film since Howard the Duck.  (There I said it.  Howard. The. Duck.) Yes, he appears for a millisecond in III, but it was enough to remind me of Lucas' unfortunate penchant for cutesy characters like Ewoks.  (To bad THAT planet couldn't be torched by the Death Star instead of Alderan.)  And the wasted film space, oh my.....5.  Living Off The Past.  There is no way Star Wars would have had anywhere remotely near the cultural impact it had (and deserved) if Lucas had led off with these clunkers.  III comes alive only because we anticipate three events that shape Episode IV - the transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader, the birth of Luke and Leia, and the betrayal of the Jedi and end of the Republic.  This is well handled in III, but too, too late.  Episodes I and II contributed next to nothing - the first espisode was fully disposable, and III could have tracked Anakin's rise as a Jedi in Episode II in a trice, losing nothing, especially if one considers the breakneck pace of IV.So.... III is worthwhile, but there is no possible way I would waste my time with I, II, III sequentially over a week just as I finished the three episodes (10+ hours) of Jackson's ""Lord of The Rings"", which have everything, including pacing and humor, lacking in I and II, and most of III."	3.0	Oh, what could have been.....	2005-11-28	10	8	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A10KXWR8Y6ENDV	Nazz	"I hate this kind of nonsensical opinionated prediction stuff.Look at it this way, if you didnt like eps 1 and 2, its a safe bet your not gonna like this. End of. Lucas will do what he's always done. Make it his way. He'll finish this new trilogy in the style of the other two movies. Mark my words. He aint gonna change cinematic history with this film, hes already done that twice with ""A New Hope"" and recently with this new digital sony cam he's helped to construct. Honestly, i really do hope im proven wrong. The chemistry between the cast just isnt in these new movies, at least no where remotely near Hamill & co. Its a pointless never ending debate that will rage long after these movies are boxed up in a 6 disc set, and it aint gonna change a goddamn thing. So whats the point? Episode III will have lightsabers, John Williams, Artoo and Threepio, explosions and stormtroopers. My 5 year son loves 1&2 and he couldnt give a toss about the acting or direction and THIS IS THE POINT.No doubt all these reviews on Amazon are written by people of roughly my generation, we were children completely blown away by what we were seeing and hearing, and you'll NEVER recreate that no matter who was cast in these new movies. Not even close.So, leave Mr. Lucas alone, and let him do his thing. He's given us all enough already."	5.0	Revenge Of The Fans	2004-09-19	25	14	11
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	Revenge of the Sith, the third prequel in George Lucas' Star Wars cash cow, is much better than Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones ever hoped to be.  Picking up after the events of Attack of the Clones, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are in pursuit of General Grievous who has kidnapped Chancelor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), while Yoda leads the Clone troops against the droids on the Wookie home planet.  Like the above Amazon review states, by this point Revenge of the Sith appears to be going in the direction of the previous two prequels, but then out of nowhere, everything changes.  Palpatine reveals himself, Anakin chooses his loyalty between Palpatine and the Jedi Knights, and Padme (Natalie Portman) reveals her pregnancy.  Even casual Star Wars fans know where it's all headed, and Revenge of the Sith culminates in a spectacular fight as Lucas surprisingly manages to weave his mythology together.  The acting is still stiff in places, but everything else works here, which is a pleasent surprise to say the least.  Revenge of the Sith makes the most of it's PG-13 rating (this is the first Star Wars film not to have a PG rating) making it the darkest and most violent film of the franchise, and Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader is a sight to behold.  All in all, it still can't hold a candle to the original trilogy, but then again, what does?	4.0	Much better this time around	2006-02-17	5	2	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AK9LN821QYQG9	Neal J. Wertanen	"After Episode I and II were recieved with less than great reviews, the fear was that Episode III would also fail to deliver. I myself must say in the forefront here, that I quite like Episode I and quite enjoy Episode II. I believe the prequel trilogy, complete now with III, perfectly sets the stage for the classic trilogy we all know and love.III starts with the most amazing ""out of the gun"" shot in a movie I've ever seen, and then jumps into an amazing battle in the space above Coruscant. If you've watched the ""Clone Wars"" cartoon, you know that the droid leader, General Grevious, is attempting to escape after ""kidnapping"" Palpatine. Anakin and Obi-Wan make there way to his ship and have a rematch of Episode II's duel with Count Dooku.After the adrenaline-pumping opening, spanning about the first half-hour or so, it comes back to Coruscant and slows down...if only for a bit. We learn of Padme's pregnancy and Anakins dreams about her dying in childbirth. Palpatine continues to scheme and places Anakin on the jedi-council as his personal represenative, convincing Anakin that the jedi have a plot to overthrow him.Hayden Christianson plays the turmoil in Anakin extremly well in this movie, and the film really is on his back. Quickly Yoda and Obi-Wan head off on seperate missions while Anakin remains to be the middle man in a conflict between the council and palpatine, where Anakin discovers Palpatine is infact the sith lord. After obi-wan destroys grievous, Mace Windu and 3 other masters head to force Palpatine to give up his seat as chancellor and the sith lord strikes hard and fast with a concealed lightsaber, killing the other 3 masters in just a few seconds.Mace and Palpatine have a duel, not the greatest (in this movie or any other in the series) but still good because of how important it is to the series. Mace has Palpatine cornered when Anakin arrives and pleads for Palpatine to be spared, thinking Palpatine is the only one who can help him save Padme. Mace refuses, and Anakin makes his choice...he stikes Mace and Palpatine fries him with sith-lightning. Anakin declares himself loyal to Palpatine, and is sent to kill all the jedis at the jedi temple...including, in a heart-wrenching moment, the jedi younglings.This all sets the stage for the climatic duel for Obi-Wan and Anakin. The film never dissapoints or shys away from what it needs to do. It seems to go by in a blink, and more than a few tears are shed. Lucas goes out with a bang, with the only possible end he could make to this amazing saga."	5.0	A fitting, and emotional end to a 28 year journey.	2005-10-02	14	12	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1ZUC5J8G6KZXA	neoninfusion	"As is typical of George Lucas' Star Wars DVD releases - Episode's I and II and the box set of the original trilogy, Episode III falls well short of expectation. However, the film is outstanding.First, the movie. Episode III is clearly the superior Star Wars film of the prequels. Finally the pace picks up and events unfold almost relentlessly with all the questions leading into this film answered well. The obvious question - how did Anakin Skywalker become Darth Vader is done brilliantly as it involves Palpatine initially and ends with the highly-anticipated conflict with Obi Wan. Also, Darth Vader's masking scene is juxtiposed with Padme's demise - superb directing. The most demanding question for me was: how strong in the force is Palpatine if Yoda has to flee? The battle scene between these two is what I really wanted to see. And it delivered like everything else. Everything about this movie is powerful. If you are a Star Wars fan you must buy this film. If you are not a fan, don't listen to the critics who have lambasted George Lucas in the past and check Episode III out for yourself.Now for the DVD package. This is a two disc package. The first contains the movie, while the second disc contains the typical features associated with DVD releases these days (3 stars). Before I actually played disc 2, there seemed to be a plethora of extras listed on the back cover: 15 web documentaries; deleted scenes with commentary; a number of trailers and TV spots; post-production photo gallery; and 3 full length documentaries made for this release. There seems to be so much on the DVD, but in fact, I had finished everything in one afternoon! This only serves to reveal that George Lucas just went through the motions - to put enough on the DVD to keep us happy. I'll watch these once and probably never again. I also couldn't access the DVD-ROM weblink due to some problem with the system I was to download, so I can't comment on this material.However, there is one very good documentary called ""Within a Minute"" which focuses on one minute during the Anakin / Obi Wan duel with respect to every single job that was required to get that one scene perfect. From accountants to caterers to post-production and sound. I hadn't actually realised the depth required to make a film until this documentary. I think it showcases the film industry better than Peter Jackson did on his Lord of the Rings DVD's. This only highlights the problem with this DVD release - George has the ability to create a fantastic DVD package, but he has ultimately failed with Revenge of the Sith. The total package isn't a patch on the Lord of the Rings - the benchmark.I'm a Star Wars fan, and I'm expecting Lucas to come up with something special when he puts together his special edition versions of Episodes I to III or perhaps the ultimate I to VI box set. This is worth having for the movie, perhaps the best Star Wars film ever (or at least since 1980)."	4.0	Great Film, Average DVD extras	2005-11-19	3	1	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1DK5AZMXS1QA3	Newton Ooi	"I will provide this review in two parts; the first for the movie and the second for the DVD.First, the movie itself.  The first three Star Wars (SW) movies were some of the most amazing, popular, and incredible movies ever made; so it would be hard for anyone to match them, even George Lucas himself.  Yet after the disappointment with Episodes I and II, many were hoping for a much better III.  Unfortunately, these hopes were dashed.  Episode III does tie up all the loose strings and story lines, and is an entertaining movie, but overall is still quite disappointing, even in comparison with Episodes I and II.  The plot was disappointing, the acting was disappointing, the dialogue was disappointing, and even the musical score was not as awesome as the previous five movies.  Lets address each disappointment separately.Of all the SW movies, this by far had the most plot holes in it.  Too many things occurred that did not make sense, and I will list them here.A) Why is it that whenever multiple Jedi face a lone Sith Lord, the latter usually wins, but when one Jedi faces one Sith Lord, the Jedi wins, or at least does not lose?  Opening fight scene; Obi-wan and Anakin versus Count Dooku results in Dooku knocking out Obi-wan.  Yet Anakin by himself beats Dooku.  When the Jedi Masters arrive to arrest Palpatine, he kills three of them quickly, yet Mace Windu by himself can stop him.  Anaking enters the Jedi Temple and kills scores of Jedi Knights, yet Obi-wan beats him in one-on-one combat.  None of this make sense; do the Jedi NOT learn how to fight in teams as part of their training?  This nonsensical trend is actually found in Episodes I and II.  In Episode I, Qui-Gon and Obi-wan cannot defeat Darth Maul together, but Obi-wan by himself kills Maul.  In Episode II, Anakin and Obi-wan each do better fighting Count Dooku individually than they do together.B) Why did Yoda and Obi-wan split up to take on Palpatine and Anakin separately?  Common sense would have dictated that they both went after Palpatine together, retake the Republic and command of the Clone Troopers from Palpatine, and then worried about Anakin.  Do the Jedi NOT learn military strategy as part of their training?C) How did Mace Windu defeat Palpatine yet Yoda could not?  After all, by the time Palpatine met Yoda, he had already fought four Jedi Masters, and been burnt by his own force lightning.  If anything, Palpatine should have been weary, tired, and be an easy match for Yoda.D) How is it that General Grievous can kill all those Jedi Knights (as proven by his lightsaber trophies) yet quickly get two hands cut of by Obi-Wan, and is eventually killed by him?  Obi-wan is a Jedi Master, but he does not even have the use of force lightning yet...E) How could Anakin not sense that Padme was carrying twins?  If Obi-wan could sense that Padme was pregnant in just 5 minutes with her (when he asks her of Anakin's whereabouts), then Anakin surely should have been able to sense twins in all that time with her both in and out of bed.F) Why, when Mace Windu is about to kill Palpatine does Anakin cut his hands off?  Why didn't Anakin just knock his lightsaber upwards?G) Why does General Grievous have a consistent cough?  For a creature that has been technologically enhanced in every conceivable way, why didn't he do something to fix that cough?  More importantly, why does a creature that does not breathe cough?  When Grievous escapes in the beginning of the movie, he goes outside his own spaceship, and clearly is not wearing any breathing suit during his spacewalk.  Ergo, he does not breathe, yet he coughs as though he has trouble breathing.Next, the acting.  This is probably the biggest complaint people have for Episodes I-III with respect to the original three; the acting is horrible in the new trilogy.  There are many instances of this.a.  Throughout the movie, Palpatine just oozes distrust and suspicion.  In his facial expressions, words, walk, and everything else, it was obvious he was evil.  Did Lucas plan it this way?  I hope not; Palpatine was supposed to pass as a good guy until he reveals himself.b.  Mace Windu's character is like the Al Gore of Jedi Knights; boring like a lump on a log.  Great leaders in general, and great military leaders in particular, tend to have livelier, often magnetic personalities.  Did Lucas intend to portray Mace as uptight?  Or was it just bad acting?c.  Like Episode II, the romance scenes between Anakin and Padme were so fake.  Even first loves between little kids are more interesting than this one between a politician and a whiz-kid soldier.  Lucas set up a unique romance; one that has never been seen before in a major movie; a woman of high birth and great potential who loses it all to a guy who goes bad because he loves her too much to let go of her.  Hollywood has lots of movies about bad guys turning good for the nice girl (e.g. As Good as it gets), or bad girls turning good for the nice guy (e.g. Pretty Woman), but there has never been a movie about a good guy turning bad because of the good girl.  Lucas had a totally original romance going, and he screwed it up, both in the beginning (Episode II) and in the end (Episode III).Now the dialogue.  Lots of complaints here.I. The romance dialogue was horrible.  The dialogue between two people in love has comedy, surprises, half-vieled threats, hints of jealousy, spontaneity, occasional insults, snide comments and everything else possible flowing thru it.  None of this was seen in the dialogue between Padme and Anakin in this movie, making it even worse than the romance scenes in Attack of the Clones.II. For all the great wisdom of the Jedi Masters, they seem to talk very little.  Decisions seem to be made pretty quickly; e.g. the discussion that sent Yoda to the wookies took one minute!III.  Too many one-liners.  This was fine in the opening scenes when Anakin and Obi-wan banter at each other as they make their way thru the General's flagship.  But it was very insufficient for the rest of the movie.IV.  Why does everyone, except R2 and the Wookies talk in English?  One of the great things of Episodes IV, V, and VI was the various languages the different creatures used, even those in the same side (e.g. Lando and his co-pilot on the Falcon in Return of the Jedi).  Yet in this movie, everyone except the Wookies speak in English!V.  Why does Palpatine tell Anakin to leave Obi-wan in the opening sequence?  If anything, this should have tipped Anakin of towards Palpatine's true self and bred a solid mistrust of him.  Palpatine himself should have known better than to say something so strident and flippant.Overall, the dialogue lacked in both quantity and quality.Last, the music.  Episodes IV, V, and VI were remarkable in the various musical themes they introduced.  Episodes I and II each had some new themes, though nothing astounding.  I heard nothing new for this episode; only a rehash of the music I heard in the other five movies.  Musically, this was the most disappointing of all six SW movies.So overall, the music, the dialogue, the acting and the plot was disappointing.  The entire movie was disappointing.  Now to the DVD.  One of the first, very successful DVD's to be ever released was the Phantom Menace DVD in 2000.  Containing all sorts of ""cookies"" and special features, this DVD is found in many collections.  All these bells and whistles are found in the DVDs of Episode II and now Episode III.  Yet there is one thing that all three lack; they leave the extended / deleted scenes removed from the movie...  Why is this?  One of the main selling points of the LOTR DVD's is that all the extended scenes are fit seamlessly into the movie itself.  I wish George Lucas had did this also, or least offer a DVD version that did.  In this respect, I also find the DVD's disappointing.  Overall, disappointing end to a great epic."	2.0	Disappointing	2006-01-10	21	13	8
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AP5NXS66INNOB	newyork2dallas	"After the first two prequels, I had lost some love for the Star Wars franchise and with good reason: Return of the Jedi was the poorest of the prior batch and far surpasses the first two efforts in the prequel arc, which were (1) very poor and (2) bad.Where does Episode 3 rank?Star Wars itself gets an A because of what it is, even though it's not the best of the bunch. Empire gets an A as well, and is the best. Return of the Jedi is worth a solid B to B+ because it had a satisfactory end to the series AND what is still the best space battle in movie history.Phantom Menace was a C- movie and that may be kind; Clones was at best worth a C; Revenge gets a B-. With lowered expectations comes greater relative satisfaction.So here's the good, bad, ugly and missed opportunities of Revenge of the Sith:The Good: Ian McDiarmid, period. Also good: Yoda kicks a** again, some of the fights are great fun, Yoda fights Palpatine, Hayden Christiansen is much better after Anakin goes bad than when he struggled with his Dark Side/Light Side orientation, the last hour of the movie is solid stuff overall and is the one part of the three prequels that ties in with the original trilogy both in style, feel and quality.The Bad: Samuel L. Jackson's portentiously droning Mace Windu -- he was absolutely awful. Notably weak: the Jedi other than Obi-Wan, Mace Windu, Yoda and Anakin.  The mystique of the Jedi suffers a lot in this film because most of them seem like just ordinary soldiers with light sabers. Other bad: Natalie Portman's acting, much of the dialogue throughout the film, and surprisingly some of the special effects.A.O. Scott, the NYTimes' top reviewer essentially said this movie showed Lucas was far ahead of even Peter Jackson in special effects production. Not true at all. First: the lizard steed Obi-Wan rides whilst chasing General Grievous (droid army leader) looks like a sprightly version of those Clash of the Titans monsters and only slightly more real. Second: the backgrounds on the lava planet where Anakin and Obi-Wan had their duel looked nearly as fake as they were. Jackson did a fantastic job integrating CGI effects (i.e., the Oliphaunts) with live action and did it consistently throughout 12 hours of CGI-heavy films.The Ugly: Padme calls Anakin ""Annie"" on three occasions.  What a tin ear for names by Lucas.  Also ugly: the incoherent initial battle sequence as Anakin and Obi-Wan fly to save the Chancellor, the weak rolling thingamajig fight with Obi-Wan and General Grievous, and Anakin himself (just from a how-he-looks perspective) after losing to Obi-Wan.Missed Opportunities: I probably don't have time to hit this category in full between now and the end of the month. But let's go with a few of them.(1) Anakin's training -- the willful prodigy who grows to be the greatest Jedi before turning bad is an unexplored issue. The first movie could have concentrated on finding Anakin, his training inside the Jedi Temple, his innate abilities and his willfulness -- the first part in flash back, the rest in present day all with a rising conflict in the background (the trilogy was supposed to be Anakin's story, after all), greater use of Darth Maul, and an older and more versatile actor playing Anakin as a preteen to young teen instead of the kid who earned the moniker Mannequin Skywalker for his poor performance. Indeed, Lucas could have cribbed a LOT from Ender's Game to make the prequels better.(2) The Jedi mystique -- Jedi knights were legends of the Old Republic in the original trilogy. Defenders of the realm, they were the janissaries of the realm with power over the Force and tremendous physical abilities. But we never got a look into the Jedi Temple's inner workings, we never learned how they obtained their exalted status or whether they were in decline when Anakin turned to the Dark Side. Instead, Lucas basically uses prostheses and funky make-up to substitute for any actual insight into what made the Jedi masters and the knights great.(3) Darth Maul and Qui-Gon -- two underused characters, especially the former. If the Sith were believed dead and destroyed as of Episode I, how did Maul become one and apprenticed to Darth Sidious? And go back one -- explain the rise of Darth Sidious and his master before him, etc.There are more and more and more. Ultimately, starting the prequels with Anakin as a nine-year old kid, casting Jake Lloyd and rooting the first story in a goofy trade dispute set a disastrous tone for the prequels that could not be overcome. Revenge of the Sith is interesting in its own right, and the last hour would be brilliant flashback material for inclusion in a LONG version of Return of the Jedi, but the rest of the prequels are basically rubbish.George Lucas ultimately failed where Peter Jackson succeeded brilliantly. Jackson took a beloved story, stayed true to its roots and loyal to the tale's core philosophy. And the Lord of the Rings movies are outstanding.Lucas is another story: He took a beloved story, expanded it and made a hash of things. He failed the fans and failed the franchise. What's worse, the whole thing was his creation; ultimately, he failed himself."	3.0	Missed Opportunities Galore	2005-06-21	15	9	6
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ	Nicholas Carroll	"I had no doubts that I would love this film, as I loved every one of the previous five. All comments about poor acting and dialogue aside, people put too many expectations on this film series and miss the larger picture. If you want to see brilliant acting, watch an Academy Award-winning picture. If you want snazzy dialogue, watch a Quentin Tarantino film. But if you want mesmerizing visuals and a modern retelling of the classic Mythological tales, then ""Star Wars"" is it.The first trilogy captured my imagination like no other films have, and will always hold a special place in my heart. However, having said that, I do find the prequel trilogy to be more visually stunning than the original trilogy, with a more interesting storyline. Lucas teased us through Episodes I and II as I wanted to know more about Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious. He saved the best for last, as Ian McDiarmond is the best thing about Episode III. His performance is brilliant, intelligent, and complex. The way he can toy with Anakin's mixed emotions makes an understandable cause for Anakin's turn to the dark side of the force. I especially loved his explanation to Anakin about the irony of Darth Plagueis' ability to use the force to conceive life while being unable to save himself from certain death by an unnamed apprentice (which viewers are left to assume was Darth Sidious--or Supreme Chancellor Palpatine himself). Anakin's fear of losing Padme like he lost his mother leads him to the dark side, as he wants to learn the secret to prevent those he loves from dying. Of course, the irony is apparent throughout...as we learn about Qui-Gon Ginn (whose voice we heard in Episode II before Anakin kills the Sand People). It makes everything more profound for ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" when Obi-wan tells Darth Vader, ""if you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine."" Darth Vader believes power comes from his use of the force and light saber, but Obi-wan knows the truth and was able to attain it without turning to the dark side.This film opens with a bang and R2-D2 definitely steals the early scenes as he plays hero who gets all the laughs. One interesting development I noticed from Episode I through III is that R2-D2 was one of Queen Amidala's royal robots, yet by III, he spends his time with Anakin; and Anakin created C3PO, who becomes the personal assistant to Senator Amidala. An interesting switch, I thought.The opening light saber duel is meant to evoke the final one in ""Return of the Jedi"", as Anakin did what Luke dared not to. I loved how well they correspond, with the sinister Palpatine egging on a confused Anakin in ""Revenge"" and Luke in ""Return"". Parallels like that are apparent throughout the series. We also experience deja vu with Episode I's opening scene when Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan run down a hallway as droidekas attack. This time its Obi-Wan and Anakin.The scene when Yoda escapes Kashyyyk in his personal spacecraft as Chewbacca and the other Wookiee watch reminded me of the final scene in ""E.T."" and I'm not sure if that was intentional, but I imagine it is. Lucas is known to borrow familiar motifs in his films as a tribute to the ideas that he loves. If there are any disappointments to be had in this film, for me it was in the minor role of Kashyyyk, as I expected it to be a bigger part of the movie. I read in a magazine article that Lucas actually cut more scenes out of this part of the film as it went on too long. Considering all the planets we do see in this one, I suppose he made the right decision. Lucas originally wanted to use Kashyyyk for ""The Return of the Jedi"" but with the expense of suiting actors up in Wookiee costumes made Lucas decide to create the loveable Ewoks instead. Now with CGI technology, he was able to return back to his original idea to show us Chewbacca's home planet, which resembles the islands of Thailand.The lightsaber duels continue to amaze as Lucas ups the ante from previous films. This time, we have the opening repeat of Anakin versus Darth Tyranus/Count Dooku. Then Obi-Wan versus General Grievous, who wields four lightsabers at once. And of course, the show stopping finale that we've speculated on since 1977...Obi-Wan versus Anakin on the lava planet Mustafar.By the end, Lucas ties all the strings, landing each point clearly, save one. In ""Jedi"", Leia told Luke her memory of her mother since he couldn't remember. In ""Revenge"", Amidala dies shortly after childbirth, so we are left to wonder maybe Leia mistook her adoptive mother for her real one? Or maybe Lucas had to make Amidala die sooner to fit this film's chronology? We'll never know, but its only a minor, minor flaw.Overall, I like ""Attack of the Clones"" slightly better, which is appropriate, as I like ""Empire"" best of the original trilogy and best of the entire saga. The middle film in both trilogies fill in a lot of details while leaving us more to look forward to. Now with the saga concluded, there is nothing to look forward to. These films have represented a major part of my life's imagination and I suppose it's time to anticipate other things. But I do thank Lucas for making the prequel trilogy. People who nitpick and complain about it, the question remains...are you happy or not that the prequel trilogy was even made? George Lucas took us to many beautiful, strange new worlds. The visuals are stunning. Had he the technology in the 1970s/1980s, I'm certain that his original trilogy would be just as visually stunning as the prequels. They stand in their own right, but I'm one who appreciates Lucas risking his franchise to complete his saga. May the force be with us all."	5.0	Satisfying conclusion to the best movie saga ever	2005-08-09	17	14	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3HGKHWYU99CJ9	Nicholas	Me gusta Star Wars mucho. Tuve tanto enthusiasmo por este pelicula cuando yo lo mire por la primera vez. Me gusta este pelicula porque es la mejor en su clase.  Pero, anhelo que lo fue sin la fuerza, y todas las cosas superficial, por ejemplo peleando con sus espadas demasiado.Tambien, la pelicula tuvo una frase cerca la fin, cuando los Jedis estaban peleando que es malo.  Obi-wan dije algo falso a Anakin. Dije que solo los Sith estan tomando en absolutes. Eso no es correcto de mi punto de vista. Es un ejemplo de relativismo.  Es equivocado porque los Sith estan malo y peleando por sus mismos.  Anakin es ciego a la verdad.Tiene mucho pasion hacer un emperio galactico por su mismo.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2TPT1RXE8IY8B	Nick Baimbridge	"It has been interesting, to say the least, to follow the buzz surrounding the final Star Wars prequel film, from the time before the film was released in theaters to now, 4 years afterward.  In the beginning, people were claiming that ""no one cares about Star Wars anymore"" after the first 2 prequels (despite their having made nearly $750 million total in domestic box office, and that Ep.II was generally considered an improvement and a step in the right direction after Ep.I), and that Ep.III was going to be another ""bomb"".  Then, lo and behold, just when some people were salivating at the chance to rip apart yet another SW film, the critical reaction to ""Revenge of the Sith"" came back positive, with accolades from Time, Newsweek, the NY Times, USA Today, and others who had hated the previous films; many declared Ep.III the finest entry since ""The Empire Strikes Back"", and one reviewer even liked it more than the original ""Star Wars"". The film would go on to make over $380 million to become the biggest blockbuster of 2005.  It seemed that rumors of Star Wars's death had been greatly exaggerated.That is...until after the movie had been out of the theaters for a few months, and then all the usual suspects came out, nitpicking and complaining like they always do.  It became ""cool"" and ""hip"" to trash this film just like its predecessors, and soon things were right back to the way they were before, with people claiming that Ep.III was also a ""flop"" that no one really liked, pretending that the film's critical and commercial success never happened.  And so here we are again, with the perpetually disgruntled fanboys crying about their ""raped childhoods"", etc. (It is ironic that this time the mainstream critics were mostly more forgiving than those know-it-alls who think George Lucas personally OWES it to them to make his movies to their exact specifications.)Anyway, it is THEIR problem if they don't ""get it"", NOT Lucas's, or anyone else's.  ""Revenge of the Sith"" completes the prequel trilogy in fine form, and brings SW full circle, as well. Ep.I began in a rather muddled fashion, trying to balance introducing the characters with a plot focused on small, localized events.  In Ep.II (which was a decent movie in its own right), the grand plots sweeping the entire galaxy began to take shape, and events began on a galactic scale to lead inexorably to Ep.III, wherein we witness the fall of both the Republic, and Anakin himself.In the crucial role of Anakin Skywalker, Hayden Christensen is clearly more comfortable this time out, capturing Anakin's conflicted emotions and insecurities that rage beneath his ostensibly heroic persona, which cause him to become disillusioned with the Jedi and his own lot in life.  This leaves him open to the manipulations of Palpatine -- the second crucial character here.  Ian McDiarmid does a masterful job as the Emperor, who is revealed as the driving force behind the events in the saga to that point.  The relationship between Anakin and Palpatine, his trusted father figure who leads him astray into making his Faustian bargain, is the heart of the movie, and is what makes it work.  Indeed, one of the most emotionally powerful sequences is &lt;&lt; SPOILER ALERT >> when Anakin betrays Mace Windu and pledges his loyalty to the now disfugured Palpatine and his cause, then receives his first orders as Darth Vader -- effectively marking the birth of the evil Empire.  Yet, it seems clear that Anakin is still conflicted and unsure of himself, even as he commits more evil acts, up until his final transformation at the end -- by which it is too late.The third player is Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, who continues to fight for the doomed Republic ( I especially like the battle with General Grievious, who swings multiple light sabers like whirling neon helicopter blades) until he is forced to take action against his former pupil; the aftermath is particularly moving, inspiring pity not only for the mortally wounded Anakin, but also for Obi-Wan, who seems to suffer just as much.  McGregor has practically made the character his own; he could almost be the ""Han Solo of the Prequel Trilogy"" -- which lends a bit of irony to Han's remarks about Kenobi in Ep.IV...Finally, there is Yoda, who seems to feel the final defeat of the Jedi as a personal loss.  His duel with the Emperor, where they both unleash their powers to the greatest extent yet, was also one of my favorites.  The deleted scene on the DVD showing Yoda's arrival on Dagobah, while not vital to the story, did capture the melancholy of his situation perfectly.All these elements, wrapped up in the usual barrage of sights and sounds that can only be found in a Star Wars film, make Ep.III a classic that ranks right up there with the Original Trilogy; the entire last act of the film has a pervasive mood of sadness and melancholy, coupled with the exhiliration one gets from watching the best tragedies. All the cards are laid on the table -- the covert plots and foreshadowings of the previous 2 episodes are finally brought to fruition, and the previously hidden conflicts are now waged openly, leading to the civil war of Eps.IV-VI.  The fall of the Republic is symbolized by the transformation of Anakin into Vader, and the original series can now be viewed as his struggle for redemption, as much as the Empire vs. Rebellion conflict.  Vader has been redefined as a tragic figure, rather than a purely evil one; it is impossible for me to see Vader now without imagining the brooding, grieving Anakin behind the mask.  It also sheds light on the true nature of Vader's and the Emperor's relationship as master and slave, having been from the beginning based on lies, deception and betrayal -- a theme that would resurface throughout the original films. (In fact, this was hinted at even before the Anakin/Obi-Wan duel, when Anakin refers to ""his empire"" in his speech.  It suggests that he was NOT acting purely for unselfish reasons [saving Padme, etc.] when he chose his path, but also for his own secret desire for power.)As for the Emperor, he shows his true nature in his reaction to Vader's scream when he realizes what has happened. (Many criticize this scene, but it is a fitting illustration of the Faustian themes of the film, with the Emperor as the grinning devil and Vader as the tormented soul in Hell.) Yet, at the same time, when Palpatine rescued Anakin after he was burned and near death, he showed hints of the fatherly affection that he may have indeed felt for him, despite his twisted motives.At the end of the day, the Prequel Trilogy, with Ep.III as its crown jewel, effectively fleshes out the background of the Star Wars saga.  While some parts of the PT were uneven, it makes it possible now to view the original movies with a new sense of the history behind them.  And ""Sith"" is a film that actually improves after repeat viewings, which enable one to catch all the nuances that might be missed the first time around.  With this movie, Lucas rewarded the fans who stuck with him, and brought the Star Wars series full circle....And now, the saga is complete."	5.0	And Now the Saga is Complete	2009-07-24	36	29	7

The special effects are amazing and the soundtrack is very nice which of course makes the movie very entertaining.  Some people say the acting is whats wrong with star wars but its not the acting and the actors its the choppy dialogue and scripts of the story.  That and the fact that there isn't a scene in the movie longer than 3 minutes makes it very hard to follow.  This movie is 3 stars for the quality compared to other movies but who am I kidding come on.. its star wars.. and thats the reason that its 5 stars in my book.	3.0	i loved it	2005-08-18	9	0	9

It leaves WAY to many questions to be answered. The final fight scene between Anikan and Obi-Wan didn't live up to the hype.

Didactic and profound yet throwaway at the same time, without hitting the viewer over the head explicitly with many of the complexities involved in why things happened as portrayed; yet stunning everyone as usual with the fantasticly realised Star Wars universe.The prequel arc requires perhaps more imagination on part of the viewer to grasp the downfall of the Jedi-order, the republic, obi and Anakin's friendship, friendship vs profesionalism, public duty vs self-interest, individualism vs bureaucracy, war for peace, ultimately the changing line between good and bad.These are all questions asked in the prequels, although less answers are supplied.In short, perhaps the prequel trilogy requires more objectivity than the first trilogy did. I think the prequels have been a super project, being both hugely entertaining and enthralling, and why they do a good job masquerading as popcorn blockbusters underneath they can also be something else entirely different.	5.0	Consume you it will, as it did obi-wan's apprentice	2005-08-17	0	0	0
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A10X0JN8KTK89H	ninjasuperstar	"1. Really, are there any spoilers? You should know most of this film going into it. I respected that Lucas knew that and still gave the audience an entertaining and sometimes surprising movie. That is to his credit.2. I've heard people complain about the coughing robot, General Grievous, a fine character indeed. Yet the film makes it obvious that the character is alive, and so the coughing is not a problem.3. The acting was truly a set back for Attack of the Clones and everyone knows that Jar Jar ruined The Phantom Menace. In this film, I see a very mature Hayden Christiansen who nearly pulls off the role of Anakin, if not for a few hiccups here and there. Yet the moments where Christiansen falters as an actor are largely due to cheese in the script or having to ""interact"" with an eye towards post-production computer graphics. Even Natalie Portman is bearable here. She finally realizes that her character is meant to love Anakin and die in childbirth. Both Portman and Christiansen simplify their characters and get to the raw root, which is the only way to make Lucas' script work. I believe Anakin cared for Padme. I believed his motivation was such that he would risk his sanity for her life. It doesn't work completely, but I'm more apt to blame Lucas' wooden script before I blame the actors.4. And yes, there were two or so gaping flaws. Anakin's transformation to the darkness is missing something. The scene needed him to threaten Palpatine's life just one more time, and for Palpatine, like the devil he is, to tempt Anakin more strongly to the dark side of the force. That's it. One more mind job and I would have more completely believed and perhaps even empathized with Anakin.It's startling to realize how contrived Vader's costume truly is. Is all of that sleekness necessary to keep Anakin alive? And why is most of that scene so terrible? Instead of interrogating Palpatine thoroughly and emotionally, Vader throws his hands up and yells, ""Noooooooooooo!"" As Yoda would say, ""Crap that was."" Other than some strings of bad dialogue, these are the only problems that come to mind. Yet the problem scenes are significant to the transformation of the film's central character, and it's unfortunate that they are so poorly done.5. I didn't hear much new music. This is bothersome to me and seems negligent of the audience.6. Of the first three episodes, this is by far the easiest to follow and understand. As I mentioned above, the fixation on Jar Jar in The Phantom Menace is so distracting that one cannot pay attention to the fact that a movie is going on. And Attack of the Clones is simply too silly, un-charismatic, and bogs the viewer down with boring politics. Revenge of the Sith makes the viewer interested in politics, only briefly shows a silent Jar Jar, and POOF!..you have a watchable film. Third, er, sixth time's a charm, right?7. I was happy to be entertained while rooting for Lucas as he visibly and audibly (i.e., the script) struggled to get this film right. He mostly succeeds, and probably makes episodes 1 and 2 worth re-visiting - maybe - and he definitely inspires one want to view episodes 4-6 again.8. I hope Lucas doesn't make episodes 6-9. You cannot mess with the happy ending. And if you do, it has to be REALLY good. After all, 6-9 would merely be a variation on the themes developed in 1-6 and would be very rushed and likely unsatisfactory.9. For a mostly unforgiving critic like me to appreciate this film is something I didn't expect. I went to the film expecting to laugh at the cheese and enjoy some great special effects. I liked that I wasn't able to do this. The film has hints of the charm of the previous trilogy, but these are fleeting and unreliable. Overall, I was entertained and will definitely seek out episodes 4-6 sometime soon."	4.0	My comments are more about critics than this flawed but worthy film - 3.5 stars	2008-07-05	1	1	0
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2U4H0649HI9CE	nir085	"Victories:(mostly everything I didn't list below, but to focus on the more significant ones...)PAL-PA-TINE-SAMA: What you have heard is correct - even though it is a major understatement. Palpatine emerges victorious onscreen in every way he possibly can. I thought Palpatine, in both of his incarnations, was amazing. His over-the-top evil is more than welcome in my eyes because this movie is his rise: it looked like the old man was having fun at a theme park, when it is obviously sadism....and I loved this.Vader ascends during his descent: Some may still feel that Christensen is forever wooden, etc. Personally, I thought that he was not only a great improvement in this film, but a great asset in Clones too. The nature he portrays - gentleness always fighting against cold cruelty -is surely one that Christensen can portray better than most. Especially DiCaprio...Evoking emotion: Never let it be said (though it will be said) that RotS wasn't the most emotionally powerful. Because you'd be incorrect.Action/special effects: Nothing I say here will be more positive than other people's responses.The Force is truly unleashed: Force pushing/pulling, choking, making people unconscious, facial damage, old guys twirling and whirling, to say the least I could. Too cool.Opening space battle: Thrilling and humorous. Humor proves to be valuable, of course, not only because it is uncommon in this type of grit, but also because you see the happy comradery of everyone - an hour before they all go to Hell.Tragedies:Vader's ""NooO"": Pretty much everyone has commented on this line, and while I could ignore a few shortcomings in dialogue delivery due to the overall emotion of...well, everything...this line was insane. I would have laughed right then and there, but then the legions of lightsaber-wielders sitting around me might have Force-thrown their books, game boy advances, and moms at me.No reaction to Windu's death: I was hoping Yoda or Obi-Wan would make some sort of comment about the second/third/fourth/whatever best Jedi Master falling, but I guess it's ok since they made plenty of comments concerning Anakin's slaughter and the Jedi dying (in other ways).Anakin didn't kill Ashton Kutcher: No, Ashton wasn't originally supposed to fill the boots of a separatist leader. It just would have been a nice gesture on Lucas' part, that's all.Disappointments you may have heard about - that aren't disappointments:Portman's acting: While she is not the best fit for a SW movie, I overlooked some of her awkwardness because of her ridiculous beauty or the omenous emotion permeating her scenes. This especially holds true for the ""Anakin, you're breaking my heart!"" line, which is pretty cringe-inducing in the TV spots.The Wookie Cameo: Treat it as what I said, a cameo, and you won't be feeling let down.""She was very beautiful, but sad"": Come on. Come on. Just, come on. Could Portman (or Fischer) have made it any clearer?Ignore what others say when they talk about how this film is fourth best. They are silly. Stale bread that cannot fastforward/rewind themselves out of their nostalgia caves.Search your feelings.Or just use your brain.Revenge of the Sith is a masterpiece you will want to digest again, and again (weak hearts and dogmatic minds aside).The right measures of predictability; the right measures of surprises.Extreme measures of anguish; small, yet potent measures of hope.Everything was so vibrant...-ly horrific.It takes the two greatest qualities of SW movies - (Faustian) tragedy and sadistic hilarity - and amplifies it to the maximum.After you see this movie, even the biggest anti-Ewok zealot (should) want to see their furry picnic in Return of the Jedi.This is something that will thrill the casual SW fan; the die-hard fan who treats the movies as something waiting 3 decades for (no movie is worth waiting for for that long...), things will disappoint you.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AUTKKE1VDSEGX	"Nitram ""xt."""	OK - I have a bad feeling about this. I could write forever expressing my disappointment with this film but I will try to limit myself to a few essential points.Everyone highlights the poor dialogue and I have to concur - characters with poor dialogue are hard to respect and it's difficult to enjoy a film when you are wincing as every line is delivered. How can anyone give a film with scripts like this 5 stars? To have done so, frankly, must classify you as a fool - go home, eat some Twisties, drink some Coke and drift off to unending sleep in front of the TV. Please.Obi-Wan Vs Anakin:The end of this duel is probably the most anticipated moment in film history - and now the most disappointing. Why does Anakin, supposedly the most powerful Jedi/Sith ever, jump over Obi-Wan simply to have his legs lopped off? Why doesn't he jump further as we've seen him do before (Matrix style) and what's all that rubbish about the 'higher ground'? There appears to be meters of space between Obi-Wan and the edge of the lava for Anakin to leap onto at his discretion. Couldn't they even get a simple action sequence right? Obviously not. I was waiting for something like this: as Obi-Wan and Anakin duel, dodging towers of spattering lava, Obi-Wan is racking his brains as he knows he cannot defeat Anakin with the lightsaber - in a moment of inspiration he uses the force to move some falling lava so that it spatters onto Anakin, who collapses in agony and suprise and sustains the sorts of injuries that require a Darth Vader suit and no less. The logic of this solution must have excluded it from consideration.Vader & the death of Padme:Being so strong with the force, you would expect Anakin to know that he had not killed Padme before his duel with Obi-Wan. That he believes Palpatine upon his awakening in his new suit is not credible. That scene is a disaster. What should have been a defining moment is reduced to farce as he stumbles out of his restraints like a cripple (remember he has just been rebuilt as a cyborg with the best parts money could buy, I would assume) and then moans 'No!!!' in a less than convincing fashion. This is the man who would lift people by their throats and throw them against a wall but none of that brutal muscularity is evident here. Somehow he looks short and less than menacing. And you would think that he would be mildly angry with Palpatine now that his entire purpose for turning to the dark side turns out to be pointless in Padme's death.The Death Star:Remember that scene in Star Wars?: 'Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've contructed, admiral. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the force.' But every chance they have in this film, the Sith are peeking at their plans for the Death Star like kids with a new toy. And presumably one conquers the galaxy so that one can brood and stare at stuff alot - for as long as one wants. I think a lot of the problems with the new films is that they explain too much and do it very superficially. In the old films you had no idea who or why a bunch of people did things but you could use your imagination to flesh it out. In these films there is no room to imagine things - Lucas has done it for you but it's just a shame the quality of his imaginings have dropped so much over two decades. To be fair, Lucas is not alone here. With the introduction of CGI, most modern films depict everything far too literally - it is too easy for the Director to realise his goals - and there is little room left for the audience to participate, either emotionally or intellectually.Blue Screen/CGI vs models.Give an actor an environment to work in and they will feed off its atmosphere to augment the scene. Put an actor in front of a blue screen and you will get wooden performances. After seeing the pitiful results in the first two films you may have hoped that Lucas would refine his direction methods. But then you would hope in vain. And CGI, no matter how impressive, does not look as good as models. Models have a big advantage - they are real. What's more, scenes with models actually have to be thought through. None of the dogfights in the new films match those in Empire or Return of the Jedi and, from the new canon of lightsaber duels, only the duel with Darth Maul in Phantom Menace and the Palpatine-Windu duel were at all interesting. The others all fade into generic martial arts sequences where it is difficult to work out what's happening.On a side note - Ian McDiarmid is one of the few shining lights in this film - his performance is excellent and he actually goes out on a limb to display a bit of character.The plot holes? I see others have done an excellent job in describing these and picking them out so I won't bother other than to add this one:In Empire Strikes back as Luke leaves Dagobah for Bespin, Obi-Wan's ghost says 'That boy is our last hope' and Yoda answers 'No - there is another'. How does Obi-Wan forget that there were twins? How does George Lucas, armed with 20 years and hundreds of millions of dollars, get this stuff wrong?General Grievous:A great example of what is so screwed up with the newer films - here is a character with no purpose and no identity. Apparently he leads the droid armies though why or how he does this are things we won't worry about. His stupid cough is a pathetic attempt at humour and his name is probably an attempt at adding depth of character. Why this idiotic creature is dreaded is a complete mystery. The banter between him and the two jedi on the cruiser above Coruscant is just another lowpoint in this film, as is the ridiculous chase with Obi-Wan on that lizard creature. Given all the time and characters chucked in and chucked out from the first two films, why couldn't we have used him earlier in the series?Consider this: Over three films here, Lucas has failed to establish any other Jedi as a character apart from those we already knew. They remain as pompous fools and cannon fodder. Mace Windu begins to emerge as an entity only moments before he is killed (that was a good scene - Palpatine was great).R2's new capabilities are ridiculous here. What happened to him in the last 3(earlier) films? Couldn't the rebels afford to get him a refit? (though he gets a complete makeover at the end of Star Wars: A new hope). R2 is so much more vulnerable in the earlier films that the series as a whole makes no sense at all. In fact, as it has been pointed out, under the Empire technology seems to go backwards. What this represents is a failure of imagination - it is easier for Lucas to make certain stupid sequences in these new films work by having R2 fly. It is a lazy idea and just another example of lazy thinking. What about the 'vulture droids' in the initial dogfight sequence? Apart from their stupid pseudo-comical noises as they cut into Obi-Wan's ship, aren't they a complete rip off of the Matrix robots? And another why: If you manufacture droids that attach themselves to an enemy ship, why not simply have them explode rather than muck around cutting into non-essential circuits?The music:All the time - it never stops, incessant and overbearing and the only good bits are ripped straight out of the early films -like many things in these new films from action set-ups to character types.Anyway - I've had my rant. Revenge of the Sith was better than Ep's I and II in that it actually had a couple of 'moments' but beyond that I'm glad it's all over and George has finished wrecking his masterpieces a la Special Editions, etc.....	2.0	At last it's all over..... and the Star Wars legacy can RIP.	2005-06-08	21	16	5

The last act is very strong and the Obi-Wan and Anakin battle is very impressive. I do believe Lucas relies too heavily on special effects these days but this is still a very fun ride. Peolpe have complained that the acting and dialogue in this movie suck. The dialogue isn't great but after all this isn't meant to be Shakespeare. Ewan Mcgregor and Ian McDiarmid make this movie a true treat and prove to be the best two things about it hands down. I think Hayden Christensen has been given a bum rap, I don't think he is that bad, and Natalie Portman does well, their love story just makes them seem like lesser actors because of the cheese infused in everything they say.

Somehow tho, I felt a little empty when we left the theatre. I went again last night and now I'm bothered more than ever. This is ultimately how Episode III falls short:Padme telling Obi-Wan there is still good in him - ""We can still bring Anakin back... but I'm just going to give up and die now"" *sighDid the Emperor remind anyone else of Joker in the Batman movie? especially when he's hanging off that senate pod laughing?""Come with me, there is still good in you."" ""Obi wan once thought as you did"" - No he didn't. The whole time Obi-Wan's attitude you are a sith and I'll take you out if I have to. He never once asked Anakin to stop all this, he knows he's a good guy but he's been tricked.No Imperial March at all, altho it played in Episode II""Your father wanted you to have this"" - Not only did Anakin never say this, it's no longer a weapon of a great hero. ""Here's the same lightsaber your father used to chop up little kids 20 years ago""When Palpatine takes out Mace's posse', the first jedi he stabs is looking completely the opposite way?!The Jedi Temple Raid - This scene had soo much potential too, instead it's cut short like the rest. It would have been cool to see Vader take out one adult jediWhat was up with Palpatines extra deep voice right after he kills Mace?No spoken dialogue between Obi-Wan and the Lars family! What does he tell them happened to Anakin? and why do they resent obi-wan so much in episode 4? A man they've never seen before just shows up and and hands them a baby? c'mon it's a moisture farm not an orphanage.Palpatine Declares the Empire - This scene was well done, but why is everyone cheering? He's eradicating democracy and turning our galaxy into a nazi-police state. Yayyyyyyyyyyyy!!No rebellion scenes at all. If you watched Episode III then IV, you'd think What rebels?! The only people not cheering the emperor were a couple jedi. This is one of those things u'd naturally expect to have been at least mentioned in the prequelsAnakin's final move in the duel - What? that's it?? We've waiting 30 years for that??Tarkin - ok he's in it for 10 seconds. He even scurries out of Vader's way on the Star Destroyer. But in Episode 4 he's the emperor's right hand man, ranked higher than Darth Vader??The Emperor and Vader look weaker - The Emperor gets owned by Mace then later tries to run from Yoda. The only Jedi Vader kills are kids, not to mention the nooooooo screamThe youngling taking out stormtroopers scene was awful. I'm not saying it was a bad idea, it could have been filmed better.I am far from picky, but episode 3 left soo many questions unanswered. Would it have hurt to have included those scenes?

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1WTGBI6UB6BDS	N. MOORE	"What makes a great movie? A great story. Excellent dialogue. Chemistry between the actors. Excellent direction. Great acting etc etc. This movie has none of this! The dialogue is appalling, even the actors look embarrased to be saying it! The political story is boring. Who follows politics? The best aspects of this movie are the fact that we finally get to see Darth Vader back on screen, and the special effects, but even the special effects are way over the top and impossible to take in. The movie looks like an elaborate video game and it is hard to focus.You don't connect with any of the characters, and Annakin's turn to the dark side is totally unconvincing. You don't get to know any of the characters in any detail in the movie! You hardly saw the wookies, and didn't get any background on General Greivous, so there is no reason to fear him. His cold/ coughing is a joke! There is no chemistry between Annakin and OB1, or Padme. Where are the great fun characters like Han Solo? There was excellent chemistry between Han Solo, Leia and Luke.Why doesn't George Lucas get other people to write the screenplay, and direct? These are obviously not his strong points. Has he ever heard of less is more (special effects)? There are too many people involved with the production,  he seems to be concerned with all of the details and in the process he forgot about the basics about what makes a movie great.I love the original trilogy, and I have been greatly disappointed by the last three Star Wars movies. However I would have to say that The Revenge of The Sith is the best of the recent trilogy.By the way in the original trilogy Luke and Leia discuss their parents and Leia says that her memories of her mother were that she was sad. Padme died in childbirth so Leia would have no memory of her at all!George Lucas please release the original trilogy 4-6 as they were released originally at the theatres, without the awful later additions, such as the Jabba The Hut Scene where Han calls Jabba a ""Wonderful human being""!! And the other scene where Creedo shoots first!!"	2.0	Wookie Yawn	2005-11-03	16	8	8

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2LWZGYR6P1IAM	Noah R. Bombard	"""Star Wars Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith"" is indeed far superior to its two predesessors, but still lacks the pacing and feel of the original trilogy.That being said, it's a different movie-going audience and an entirely different movie-making time that creator George Lucas finds himself in today.Some highlights of this film include a stellar performance by Ewan McGregor who is entirely belivable as a younger Obi-wan Kanobi. McGregor's earlier performances in the previous two films -- as well as the performances of almost the entire cast -- seemed stiffled and underplayed. This time around, however, McGregor, Natalie Portman -- and yes, even Yoda -- showcase their true acting talents. That, combined with an intriguing story that puts to rest questions that have remained unanswered in the Star Wars films for neary 30 years, is what really makes this one of the best Star Wars films -- and certainly the best of episodes I, II, and III.It goes without saying, the special effects and sweeping musical score by John Williams are impressive. The film is a must-see for anyone with even a passing interest in the Star Wars saga."	4.0	Almost full circle	2005-11-10	11	4	7
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AGB237U6G1CBH	"Noneof  Your buisness ""Mystery"""	"I'm actually rather perplexed to see that Starwars was able to harbor a pretty tidy box office record. Even more so am I confused to see the hype and pandemoneum raging before the movies opening. I must admit that I too was one of the freaks who counted down the days until the movies opening and stored away my loose change to sum up to the wage it costs to see the movie. But as I sat there, in my chair, being entertained, I realized that the movie should not of entertained somebody this way. It was interesting to watch, like watching a schoolyard fight, but in the same way you want to turn your head in dismay and shock or disbelief and anguish.George Lucas definetly made a mistake somewhere between the beginning of Episode one to the end of Episode three. One could tell that, almost instantaneasly. Where did it lie? Well first off, the connection between the first, second, and third episodes and the fourth, fith, and sixth episodes manages somehow to self-destruct.But enough about the past tragedies, now to the present tragedies: Well well, Here we are. What to say about this movie? The story, what happened? I mean the trailer made it out to seem like the best Starwars movie ever. But somewhere George decided to kill it, then after it was dead; he jumped in the casket and beat it until it was nine feet under. The story starts out mundane; reintroducing all the characters and thier little annoying idio-syncracies, flaunting some influx action around to entertain us, jumping into an otoise action montage in space, and making us feel bad for George Lucus, about the next topic;The acting, well at least everybody didn't suck at it. Samuel L Jackson was pretty good. But that's it. The worst of all the moronic thespians is of course, Hayden Cristensen, for his  feeble roll as the young, drugged up monkey in a jedi costume wielding a lightsaber with questionable exuberance, but later he plays as the legend, seldom breathed around for fear of being choked, Darth Vader. He should be labeled ""The Legend Killer."" That moron should be pinned to one of the turbine jets on a X-wing and implode into an oblivion as the space ship takes off in search of the ""Real"" Darth Vader. Of course his lame lines didn't help either, in the same sense that Natalie Portman's role as Padme' struck dirt in search of any raw gold talent. Let us not forget Ewan Megregor, who, to be fair was not as bad, though his nice gentle character made him appear too pasifistic and made Anakin's demeanor display too much masicism. Which in turn leads to my next topic;Sense, which may appear pecular, after all most critics don't include this in the catagorizing dossier, which is perfectly fine. The degree of verisimilitude is disturbing in this film and still in turn makes you feel bad for the crew who have no say in the story. Some things just don't make sense, and I don't think the audience wants to leave the theater in utter confusion. First off: Why me? why did the director incarcerate this movie into my mind leading to a mortal opression? Why me?Second: If you have not seen this movie yet, than you should know about Anakin's loathsome turn to the dark side....of eccentricity or rather craziness. After that point the story takes a nastier turn, leaping far below average into an inane hack n slash genre. Then you begin to think: What is going on? A good question, yes I suppose Anakin was intended to go wry, but not like this. Suddenly he is a serial killer, on a relentless butcher house killing spree, bent on appearing on ""The galaxies most wanted."" Then you think: This does not make sense. Exactly! Bravo! Congratgulations, you figured it out. Third and last: Why did the trailer make the movie out to be so interesting? It just made people more disapointed, it did not at all live up to it's high expactations.The special effects are decent, nothing I have never seen before. They could use some touch ups and a little more lighting on some scenes. The space montages are still good, nothing about the special effects leap over the mundane, though.Not a good way to end a six part epic, but I hope at least George learns from his mistakes just in case he wants to rekindle the spark that ignited Episodes four, five, and six. Not much to say except: He messed at the start of ""The Phantom Menace"" and everything pretty much self destructed from there. But needless to say I'm happy that Starwars exists in a galaxy far far away from here."	3.0	In a galaxy far far away there lived a massacred conclusion to a brilliant epic long-forgotten.	2005-08-28	18	4	14
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A33TBHM3O9AY17	No one of consequence	"""Revenge of the Sith"" is without a doubt the best of the six Star Wars films, and a fitting conclusion to George Lucas' epic sci fi story.  There were few surprises in the storyline.  In fact, it played out very much as I expected, but in greater detail.  The seduction of Anakin Skywalker by the Dark Side, and his gradual transformation into Darth Vader, was powerfully played out as his desire to do good was corrupted and twisted into evil.In the most poignant element of the story, Anakin chooses to follow the Dark Side not out of an evil heart, but out of his overwhelming desire to save the life of his pregnant wife Patme.  After Anakin begins to have premonitions of her death in childbirth, his fear of losing her begins to consume him and he is easily taken in by Palpatine's offer of the one power strong enough to save her -- the Dark Side of the Force.  Palpatine completes his manipulation of Anakin by staging what looks like a Jedi power grab, and in a grand act of betrayal all but eradicates the Jedi order.The final change from Anakin to Darth Vader is portrayed after he submits to become the apprentice of the Sith lord, Darth Sidius (Palpatine), and confronts his former mentor, Obiwan Kenobi, in a battle that will leave Anakin maimed and horribly disfigured.  The only chance to save his life is to encase him in the protective suit which we all recognize from the other movies.In a twist of cruel irony, the very power which Anakin sought to master to save his wife ends up being the death of her, as she sees his dark transformation and loses the will to live.  Anakin's premonitions are fulfilled in spite of all his efforts to the contrary, but not before Patme gives birth to twins named Luke and Leia.  The circle is neatly completed.Aside from the very well told story, the visual presentation was the best of the best.  The Star Wars trilogies have always set the standard for sci fi special effects, and this movie was the capstone.  From beginning to end the entire film is an eye-popping spectacle that simply is not to be missed.  The action is intense and the battle scenes are incredibly well done.  There are also some great humorous elements interjected at appropriate points, often centered around the hapless little droid, R2-D2.  This helps lighten the mood a bit in what is otherwise a very dark and forboding tale.  Overall, though, this was masterfully done, and definitely exceeded my expectations.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A20P2E7S3TONGQ	Obi-Wan Pancakes	"This is what we call the muppet show?  The Star Wars saga went south with Return of the Jedi and things have never been the same since.  Lucas made two stunningly great films in ""Star Wars"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and then he decided to try to compete with Sesame Street and The Electric company.  Meesa no like.  Come on George, does EVERY background creature in your galaxy have to be a refugee from ""Fraggle Rock""?  People over five years of age like Sci-Fi too.  Maybe when Lucas started working with Frank Oz during the production of ""Empire"" he became envious.  Who knows, but thousands of Ewoks and Gungans later how can one help but be disappointed?  I thought the worst was behind us with the ewoks until Lucas stunned me with Jar Jar Binks and the Gungans.  Yoda fighting Count Dooku in AOTC was so silly to me that I laughed out loud in the theatre.  He looked like Sonic the Jedi Hedgehog.  I was waiting for him to nibble Christopher Lee's kneecaps off but alas, he got away.  And why is everyone in this galaxy related?  This feels less and less like a galaxy, and more and more like Hazard county with each passing installment.  As if it wasn't a big stretch for Luke and Leia to be related, now we find out that Anakin built C3P-0.  I hear Chewie is going to show up in this new film.  What's next?  The emperor and Yoda are twin brothers?  Han Solo built R2-D2?  Lando and Luke were on the same little-league team?  It's a small world after all isn't it?  Too small.  For all the admittedly amazing eye candy of the new trilogy I must say it has thus far been a disappointment.  How does one rationalize giving Jar Jar Binks twice the screen time of Darth Maul?  These movies are absolutely loaded with potential but we mostly get silly annoying characters.  Maybe Lucas should contact Peter Jackson to rediscover how to produce an epic film.  I think he lost his touch after Raiders of the Lost Arc.  I'm surprised there were no muppets in that.  I guess his next project was Howard the Duck though wasn't it?"	1.0	Revenge of the Muppets?

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A13FBTZ8SO8T3D	o dubhthaigh	I finally got around to watching this, and my first reaction was that the acting was SO BAD, I found myself jonesing (pardon the expression) for Harrison Ford. Sure the special effects are impressive and the film actually looks so much better than any of its predecessors that the original trilogy looks like a bunch of Ed Wood movies. But after all that, the story is lame. The conversion to the dark side (honestly!) is so puerile as to be nearly laughable. However, Christopher Lee turns in a wonderfully over the top B-movie performance of a bad guy and at least gets the film time he was denied in RETURN OF THE KING, a somewhat better written film.General Grievious is what gives the first third of the movie any drive. Ewan MacGregor's Alec Guinness imitation is nowhere near as refined as his Sean Connery - he carries none of the nuance that Guiness could generate, and Guinness hated these films (rightly so). However, MacGregor does seem to be more engaged with the special effects, something painfully missing from the first two. I forget who the actress is that plays Padme, but her padded belly looks as fake a pregnancy as ever there could be. She is marginally better than Carrie Fischer, but she needs to lose that hairdo worse than Fischer did. Headphones as a hairstyle are not sexy.Jackson acts in a vacuum. I'm not sure he's even a good actor, but in this film he just reads the line and beats it to the bank to cash his paycheck. You can actually see him reading the cue cards. Palpadine or Pallindrome or whoever that guy is carries some sinister qualities, and at least was given genuine lines. He sounds like a no-goodnik with a bunch of nasty tricks up his sleeve. Pity he has no worthy adversaries.For my video rental money, though, the film belongs to the effects, the scenery and the robots. Grevious, R2 and R4 (both of whom carry more emotional resonance than any of the live actors, and C3 each inhabit their roles they way you speak of Merryl Streep or John Malkovich. Unfortunately for the live actors, they steal every scene. Blessedly there are no Jar-Jar Steppin Fetchits around.As for Christensen and Portmann, I can think of no other actors between whom there was so little sexual heat. Yeah, I know it's a kids and geeks movie, but still, you'd think some special effect like attraction could have been conjured up out there in Marin County. No such luck. I'm not going to bother with the second disc explicating the high school psychology and underdeveloped emotional life that would lead to a fixation and fetshization on such a grand scale. I have other things to do, like pick up after my puppy.So, if you're a fan, I'm sure you loved this. It IS BETTER than its predecessors. Some compliment. Maybe now that it is all over (God willing Lucas isn't dreaming about Carrie Fischer and Cardboard Ford having a Star kid), all of you can go out and get a life and stop dressing up in those silly costumes.	1.0	Get a life	2005-12-05	43	30	13
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1R96CRCV76XR0	Oliver Hardy Jr.	"WARNING: SPOILERS!Thank goodness! ROTS finally got it right!  The two previous movies were all forgotten when I saw this film. Somehow after  the catastrophes called ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones"" I had high hopes for the final installment of the saga.  ""Could George get it right this time?"" I wondered.  He did.  We get everything we wanted from the prequels: the fall of Anakin, the rise of the Empire, and the Clone War in full bloom.THE STORY: The story is quite believable and easy to follow.  Anakin has a dream about his wife, Padme`, dying.  The dream is much like the one he had about his mother before she died.  He is extremely worried about his wife, which is the root of his fall to evil.  He talks to Jedi Master Yoda about the dream.  Yoda tells him that he should be happy for the dead.  The not-at-all-reassured Anakin feels helpless until Chancellor Palpatine tells him a tale of a Sith Lord who was able to keep people from dying.Eventually, Palpatine reveals himself to Anakin as a Sith Lord.  Anakin then tells Mace Windu that Palpatine is the sith they've been looking for.  Mace heads to the Chancellor's office with some jedi support.  Anakin, in utter, mental turmoil, races to the office to try to save Palpatine, so he can teach him how to save his wife.  He kills Mace Windu and then starts an unstoppable slide to the dark side of the force.The rest is pretty much known to any Star Wars fan:  Darth Vader is born, the jedi are killed, and the Empire rises.  This is hardly the whole story.  This is merely the backbone upon which the story rests.  There is tons of action and side-stories  to keep things running smoothly.THE ACTING:  I still can't understand why George Lucas chose Hayden Christenson (Anakin Skywalker) as the star actor.  He did a pretty lousy job in AOTC and not much better in ROTS.  Another actor would be Natalie Portman (Padme` Amidala).  She is pretty bad at her lines, but she is better than Hayden.For the good actors we have Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi) who does a supremely fantastic job portraying one of the most beloved characters in the originals.  Ian Mcdiarmed &lt;-(sp) (Emperor/Chancellor Palpatine) does a darn good job.  I absolutely loved his performence.  Samuel Jackson (Mace Windu) does a great job in his small part.THE NEGATIVES: I will list the parts that I thought detracted from the film as a whole.*Stupid lines and parts by multiple droids in the beginning.*Bad acting.*Some over-the-top special effects.*Yoda talking about the ""Netherworld of the force.""*Midi-Chlorians.OVERALL:  I liked this film for many reasons, but I thought if George Lucas had tried just a bit harder it would get a full five stars from me and others.VERDICT:  I recomend going and seeing this movie, then buying it when it is transfered to DVD."	4.0	George Lucas FINALLY delivers	2005-07-05	5	4	1

This is because Lucas left a LOT of loose ends for this third movie, which results in an incredible effort to explain all of them in only one movie. The best example of this is that in this movie characters die all too often, such as Count Dooku (like in the first ten minutes), General Grievous (who was publicized too much but ended up being just a secondary character), and Mace Windu. Another example would be the Jedi; we get to see just a few deaths, and have to interpret those few killings as the extermination of most of the Jedi all over the galaxy.  And even as they tried to pack this one full, some topics were not completely resolved, like why some Jedi disappear when they die and others don't. Also, the Wookiee battle is too short. Compare it with the Ewok battle in Episode VI, which lasted like one third of the movie. It just seemed like an excuse to cash in on the reappearance of Chewbacca. The romantic dialogues between Anakin and Padm&eacute;, just as in Episode II, are boring as hell. Aside from that, I was left wondering how come in ""Return of the Jedi"" Leia says she remembers her real mother, when Padm&eacute; died just minutes (or less) after she was born. Another important goof in this movie, thanks to the horrible DVD release of the original Trilogy, is that Anakin never wore the Jedi robes he appears wearing as a ghost in the new end of Episode VI, unlike Obi-Wan and Yoda, who appear wearing the robes they had on when they died. I am also curious about why they didn't bring back David Prowse to play Darth Vader. In this Episode he looks smaller and thinner than he was in the original Trilogy. All in all, I am glad that the prequels are finally over, because I was getting tired of watching ""Star Wars"" go down the toilet."	1.0	Doesn't improve much over the previous two (SPOILERS)	2005-05-21	23	11	12

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	EPIII is just one big battle from start to end. It only pauses in a few scenes to allow the relationship between Anakin and Padme to develop, but not as much as EPII, leaving lots of room for a science-fiction bonanza of special effects. In the end too much is going on around you to take it all in with one viewing so in terms of value, EPIII is worth owning because you will watch it over and over again. Of course what we expect from the series is that Darth Vader will rise, Anakin will go down in flames, the Empire will triumph, Luke and Leia will be born and the Jedi will go into exile... so don't expect any happy endings here. Unlike the other Star Wars movies this one gets a firm PG-13 (12s in Europe) because the action levels do move into quite violent territory pushing the confines of what is considered family viewing light sabre fighting (limbs do go missing very often in this one). EPIII is much darker, and certainly more horrific, than all of the other Star Wars combined. Parents will want to see this before deciding on its suitability for younglings. Apart from the fact that EPIII is probably the biggest, fastest and most epic science-fiction film ever made, it does lack a few things that fans had hopped for... the origins of Han Solo are missing, Chewbacca only graces the screen for a few seconds as does Darth Vader (he could have been involved in at least one light sabre battle with the mask on), it still delivers by just fronting science-fiction action battle sequences from reel to reel to the point that your head just begins to do circles with all of the action figures you will have to buy to complete the collection. There are literally thousands of characters on display here. In the end EPIII is just a marvel to see and watch. It really does dazzle the screen. The final light sabre duel between Obi-Wan and Anakin on the Lava pits is intense and edge of your seat stuff... as is the rest of this movie. Nobody can say that EPIII is boring!	5.0	Execute Order 66!	2005-12-07	13	11	2

Plummer	I went and saw Star Wars 3 about a week after it came out, I liked it, but that may be because of all the space craft, and lightsaber fights. I liked the Story of Anakin turning into Darth Vader. But I now realize that Padme, was kind of shunned from this film, I mean all she really does is sit around and wait for anakin, so they can show a scene of the couple sleeping in her apartment, then she goes and dies. Also the wookies, were pointless, just a filler to strech out the running time. So some things were bad, but it was still good enough for me to buy on DVD(I have none of them), and I would say that this is the best of them, and reccomend that you see it if you remotely like StarWars.	4.0	It's pretty good	2005-06-10	6	2	4
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1ZMCLGK23FZIT	"Patrick Hodges ""Flame"""	"As one of the most awaited movies in history, it would be very hard to live up to the hype that surrounded Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith.  But it does - and does so very, very well. If Episodes I and II were the appetizers, Episode III is the main course and the desert for the Star Wars prequel trilogy.If you don't know, the Star Wars prequel trilogy was designed to be the story of a good man's decent into evil - eventually leading him to become one of cinemas most iconic villains: Darth Vader.  In Episodes I and II we see glimpses of this character as Anakin Skywalker fights off his inner anger and fear in the face of turmoil.  In Episode III, these feelings become even stronger because of the love he has for his secret wife, Padme, and his allegiance to Chancellor Palpatine.  As the Republic falls apart at the hands of Palpatine, so does Anakin.  It is truthfully painful to watch our hero's decent to the Dark Side of the Force, but the part is played magnificently by Hayden Christensen.Anakin is truly and thankfully the central character of this movie, but the other characters in the movie are pivotal as well. Ian McDiarmid (the aforementioned Chancellor Palpatine) delivers a wonderful, Oscar-worthy performace as Skywalker's ""friend"" who twists Anakin's mind and heart leading him to his eventual destruction.  Ewan McGregor also does an incredible job as Obi-Wan Kenobi, as he did in Episodes I and II, who plays a pivotal role in the movie as a protector of the galaxy and as Anakin's mentor, friend, and conscience.  The scenes between Anakin and his wife, Padme (played by Natalie Portman), are very good, heartbreaking, and touching.  Anakin discovers Padme is pregnant (with twins, unbeknownst to them - eventual Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker, and Princess Leia) which makes it all the more difficult for them to continue this marriage in secrecy. Portman delivers a wonderful performance, although her screen time is limited compared to the previous two prequels.  Both of the droids, C3PO and R2-D2, are back as well, as well they should be.  They are as essential a part of the saga as anyone is and any scene that they are in is definitely enjoyable.  The supporting cast of Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, Christopher Lee as Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus, and the voice acting of Frank Oz as Yoda are wonderful as well.Being the last of the Star Wars films and the movie that connects the prequel trilogy to the original one, anyone familiar with Star Wars can see the end in sight when watching Episode III.  As George Lucas has said, this movie has most of the plot that he had envisioned when he decided to go back and do a prequel trilogy - and the plot does shine.  This movie totally pulls you in from start to finish. From the awe-striking space battle, through the multiple incredible lightsaber and ground battles, through Anakin's heart-wrenching struggle to choose what is most important to him and all of the confusion that these choices cause, and to the heartwarming, yet tear-jerking end - this movie is absolutely incredible and one for the ages.If you are a Star Wars fan, or even if you have never really checked it out before - this is an incredible movie for all audiences.  It may be a little scary and violent for younger viewers (hence the series' first PG-13 rating), but all of these movies are incredibly clean with no objectional content whatsoever (other than what I would call ""mild"" violence with no blood or gore).  I would recommend seeing the others before seeing this one, but this movie can definitely stand alone as a truly great movie.  This is definitely a MUST SEE, in my opinion, and is a MUST BUY for anyone who has been on the incredible ride that Lucas started in 1977 with a little movie that no one thought would succeed called ""Star Wars""."	5.0	Very dark, touching, challenging, and wonderful ending to the Star Wars saga	2005-08-17	7	4	3

Okay, A New Hope was a great one, but anyone who says Phantom Menace was better than Revenge of the Sith is either 12 years old, or mildly retarded.  Revenge of the Sith was not only a great redemption for Lucas, but was a visual masterpiece.  Lucas's imagination has gone wild and I love it.  ""Execute Order 66"" gave me chills.  The movie's purpose was to be a tragedy, and for the fans who got over the movies inability to have an ""extremely"" happy ending, they enjoyed it.  And for the fans who are upset with the way the movie ended, watch Return of the Jedi and you'll get a warm, fuzzy (pun intended) feeling.

Amazing isn't it? If you have passion in your heart. If you've ever loved intensely. If you're moved by great tradgedy. If you can relate to the story of one who has greatness but falls from grace to the depths of misery, you'll love this film. If not, go toke up and go out and see Wedding Crashers again...Revenge of the Sith is the film Geoge Lucas poured everythig into. The saga is the story of the fall and subsequest redemtion of Anakin Shywalker. Portrayed brilliantly in this film. Like a Greek tragedy, Anakin wants to be good. Everythig changes however when his mother is murdered. A loss he never recovers from. He is the chose one. The most powerful Jedi ever. Yet instead of a passionless existence like the rest of the Jedi. (with the exception of Mace Windu who seems to have it out for Palpatine and Skywalker), Anakin falls in love. Padme is beautiful, intellegent, a former Queen and current senator, and adores him. How can he not love her? When premonitions of her death in childbirth overwhelm him, (like earlier premonitions of his mothers death) he succumbs to the dark side. Wouldn't you if it were the only way to save the life of the one you couldn't live without? Contrary to popular armchair reviewers who know nothing of acting or writing (I do both), Hayden Christensen gives a wonderful performance. Dark, moody and handsome, he is the perfect Anakin. And the dialouge? The best Lucas has written. Forget special effects. Look at the passion. Anakin throws away his life and kills his former compatriots all to save Padme. After all that, he's led to believe he killed her!! That doesn't hurt? See the film. Read the excellent Novel by Matthew Stovar. Listen again to the dialouge...""So, this is how libery dies.

The actions and special effect were widely used in the movie and the storyline at least had a central theme to it. I personally liked the idea of George Lucas connecting this movie to the original Star Wars movies. He did not leave anything out or anything unexplained.For those of you who are crazy about the light side, your side does not prevail. Unfortunately, dark side is the one who wins in this movie. Oh well, look at the bright side of things. In the orginal movies, light side prevails in the end. There was only one little bad part about the movie. The acting sometimes kind of sucked. For example, in the end of the movie, you hear Natalie Portman saying, ""Anakin, your breaking my heart"". I mean what kind of wannabe Romeo and Juliet is this. Personally, I thought there could have been better dialog or better acters and actresses.Star Wars Episode 3 will have you entertained from beginning to end. The action does not stop and the intense storyline has you glued to your seats. This is a movie really worth seeing if you havent seen it yet.

And as a computer generated character, Yoda surpasses LOTR's Gollum in natural expressiveness and fluidity of movement and thereby becomes the greatest of all CG characters in film. Yes, the action is non-stop, and the military technologies are exciting - but in very much the same way they excited in The Empire Strikes Back. And surprise! the slapstick stupidities of bumbling battle droids, and the wisecracking that surrounds their presence, make for an unusually jolly opening sequence. And yes, we have - and this is no spoiler - a gratifying sense of closure at the conclusion, which for me was most moving (having taken my first born as a three year old to see Star Wars - before ""Part IV - A New Hope"" was tacked on to the opening scroll - and having gone to the midnight show with my number three son, now 19: love 'em or not, we've grown up with these movies, and the finale is satisfying).BUT - although the trajectory of the story is broadly acceptable and certainly makes sense, the plotting, characterization, and George Lucas's direction of human actors remain disappointing - indeed, I'd go as far as ""abysmal"" - realizing the darkest fears of movielovers who queued up tonight to be ""the first on their block."" It's simply impossible to hide the clunky Lucas dialogue in froths of special effects - sometimes characters simply must talk to each other to advance the plot, and at most of these instances, groaners result. At some points, the audience actually gasped in disbelief and held its collective head. Anakin, Padme, Obi Wan, Mace Windoo all have ample opportunity to embarrass themselves by uttering smatterings of some of the very silliest words yet concocted for actors to speak. And wonderful character actors - Sam Jackson, Ewen MacGregor, Natalie Portman (I must be dreaming - she couldn't have done Garden State) are squandered by maladroit direction. Moreover, Anakin's descent into darkness makes film sense, but young Hayden Christensen is a hollow, callow youth, a pretty face utterly devoid of acting chops (although he's cute when he glowers). On the other hand, Ian McDiarmid, a product of the Old Vic, gobbles down every scene he's fed, with a spirited over-the-top relish. (Hooray for English Theatrical Training!)Let me stop there (it's 3:44 a.m. and it'll be off to work at the usual time). And don't get me wrong: I had fun at the movies tonight. This is a rollicking, fast-paced Saturday matinee feature, high entertainment fit for the whole family. But in my view, it is mainly a special effects extravaganza, devoid of the humanity and, yes, complexity of character that marked the first two installments (but nevertheless superior to ""Jedi,"" ""Menace,"" and ""Clones"" and particularly commendable for the almost complete absence of Gungans). ""Episode III"" has been wildly overhyped by people - our respected and well-paid film criterati - who should know better, who seem to have willed themselves to love a picture unworthy of that that measure of devotion. Apparently, they trusted the Force. (And with Mr. Potato-Head's Darth Tater, and Burger King tie-ins, etc., etc., the Force will press hard upon us, all the way through the December holidays, when, of course, the ""collector's edition"" DVD will with us as well.)But go.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2QA7AEHMMD7OC	Paul Gehrman	I'm a big fan of the original Star Wars movie (episode 4) and I also enjoyed episodes 5 and 6. I was eagerly anticipating this episode because it promised to explore Anakin's conversion to the dark side of the force. What an opportunity for George Lucas! An opportunity to further explain and explore the intricacies of the force and some of its profound psychological effects on people. Think about what we're talking about here. Anakin's transformation was no small one, and it demanded the skill and focus of good writers/moviemakers. In all of the Star Wars movies, I can't think of an area more potentially rich. For a script writer (and for Lucas as the father of this franchise), you'd have to view this opportunity as an incredible one.Needless to say, I was very interested to see how Lucas would pull this off. Thud! To say that Lucas failed miserably would be the understatement of the millenia. One minute Anakin is behaving normally, the next minute he's slaughtering children. The progression of how he ultimately gets seduced by the dark side is so shallow I'm a little surprised that Lucas would even put his name on this movie. I understand economic realities, but he's rich enough to have fixed this film. Finally, I fully recognize that Lucas' task was a very difficult one here; that is, showing Anakin's transformation within the space of a two hour movie is a challenging task to say the least. My issue is that the effort displayed here was extraordinarily disappointing, bordering on pathetic. Thus, one star.Paul Gehrman, Author, Kaleidoscope	1.0	Misses the mark	2011-05-05	11	8	3

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2UIFACS5MJH1N	Pavel Peev	This movie is a natural continuation of episodes 1 and 2, but it is betther than them. There are fewer ugly creatures. There are no low-tech scenes that remind of an arabic desert. Most of the scenery is purely futuristic and hi-tech, similarly to the environment in the Star Trek series.The story is more coherent than in Episodes 1 and 2. It emphasises on the moral conflict between good and evil, and it does not look like a teenage soap opera (which I thought episode 2 was like). There is no annoynig presence of the infantile Jar-Jar character. And they get rid of Samuel L. Jackson, whom I don't like because he looks mean for no particular reason. Episode 3 makes a nice bridge to the following episodes 4-6. In this episode, it is explained how Anakin Skywalker turns to the dark side, and where the emperor comes from. The special effects are superb, of course. My only complaint is that the overall athmosphere of the movie is dark, with a lot of talk about the dark side, and it caused me a nightmare. For this reason, I only give it 4 stars instead of 5.I regret that the episodes were not created in order 1-6, but rather in order 4-6,1-3.Watching the Star Wars movies has been the experience of a lifetime for me, spanning a period of almost 20 years.	4.0	Among episodes 1-3, I liked this one the most	2005-11-18	4	1	3

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A8IZXBE7J6RNJ	P. B. Pereira	"*review may contain spoilers""This film fails on many levels but the single most important level it fails on is perhaps the single most important facet of almost any film: story and characters.  Lucas uses chunks of clunky exposition to explain what's going on and what characters are supposed to be feeling rather than displaying it for all to see and, hopefully, believe; some, inexplicably, do believe it.  I'm one who didn't believe it and no amount of stupid dialogue is going to make me believe.Some examples:1. From Episode II (the entire PT is one continuous piece of dreck, imo, so why not include it here?), Padme suddenly, out of the blue, reveals in ridiculously florid dialogue that she's madly in love with Annakin.  Of course, the script requires that the two fall in love, but about half the film is spent showing them in emotionally void scenes, doing nothing interesting.  The fact that Padme is made to spew such nonsense is practically an admission on the filmmakers' part that none of the interaction between Padmen and Anakin was at all convincing.2.Ep III:  The newly Dark-forced (with emphasis on the word ""forced"") Anakin and his opponenent, Ben Kenobi, circle each other and bark stupid dialogue (is there any other kind in these movies?) at each other.  At some point in this exchange, Anakin states ""from my point of view, the Jedi are evil.""  Putting aside the fact that this whole story development (that which attempts to explain why Anakin became evil) is utterly retarded, this bit of dialogue, on its own, is just beyond dumb.  It should be taken out and shot, then buried in a deep dark hole.3. Also from Ep III: Padme, aghast at the change in Anakin, moans ""you're breaking my heart.""  To go along with this tripe, it is later explained to Ben Kenobi that Padme has ""lost the will to live,"" even though she is otherwise healthy.  Here she is, with two healthy twins and the presence of mind to actually name them, yet we're expected to swallow the fact that she ""died of a broken heart.  Give me a break.Of course, the reason for all this stupid dialogue and exposition (not to mention the awful plot contrivance of Anakin's vision) is because there was no time to adequately and credibly flesh everything out. Not after Lucas wasted all that  time on clones and Kid Anakin in the first two films.The notion that there was no time is actually kind of laughable, considering 16 YEARS elapsed between Episode 6 and Episode 1."	1.0	Show, don't tell	2005-11-16	25	16	9

I found everything about the Star Wars movies appealing...faraway galaxies, weird alien creatures, heroes, a kick-a$$ villain, a princess and so much more. However, I was cringing in horror with Star Wars 1 and 2. It just didn't evoke the emotions that the original Star Wars did. It seemed bloated and even irritating at points. And now, we come to the 3rd and final installment of the Star Wars universe.You already know the story, Anakin joins the Dark Side and becomes Darth Vader...so what you'd like to know is, is it worth the price of admission of seeing him get there? Well, the answer is an astounding YES. I'm happy to say that I really did enjoy this one. Right from the opening, we're basically experiencing a massive space battle. It felt like I was in the movie. I can only imagine what it must be like watching it on IMAX. Simply amazing. And from that point on, the story just evolves into what it is. Definitely no wasting time here. There's no watching a small kid talk trash and beat other experienced aliens in a pod race, there's no two teenage kids rolling on mountain tops..just straight up action and excitement.It seems that Lucas finally realizes, he's no master of screenplay. He knows that he writes corny dialogue, so he limits that and just gives us a wild ride of action sequences. Bare in mind, these action sequences are much more on a personal level. No thousands and thousands of soldiers marching towards the good guys ala Lord Of The Rings. So, you actually care what happens and look forward to the next lightsaber duel or chase scene. The CG in this movie, to me blows the other 2 to dust. Fantastic integration of CG and life-action like you've never seen before.This movie is good, but the thing that could've made it great was if it had convinced you that joining the Dark Side was the right thing in Anakin's mind. I never really felt Anakin's torment about joining the Dark Side. It should conjure a mix of emotions, I mean...for him, the lines between good and evil are blurred. But it seemed like he joined the Dark Side without much thought. He didn't like the choices, but then there wasn't much hesitation. It's a little hard to believe that after years of Jedi training and knowledge by Obi Wan (he did train him since he was a kid), he betrays the Jedi order in a second. If maybe the powers of the Dark Side were actually shown to Anakin, it might have made it more believable.But in the end, that's not going to stop you from enjoying this movie. It's a superb movie in terms of special effects and it's high in ""WOW"" factor and it does tie everything neatly for Star Wars 4.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3C1N5QS5I0XFE	Peter T. Kupfer	"I saw Star Wars III this morning. I enjoyed it a lot. The most frustrating thing about the movie was knowing what was going to ultimately happen and to watch Anakin make choices that led him that way not being able to stop him. Another thing I find frustrating at times about the Stars family of movies is that it makes the Dark Side look stronger and better. You think Yoda is invincible and then he is defeated by the Emperor. It is kind of dis-illusioning.Anakin starts the movie out on pretty good terms with Obi-Won, which surprised me given how they left the last episode. I expected a lot more conflict. I don't really buy the acting from Palpatine in the rescue scene. It is too obvious that he is controlling things. Even if you don't know, the acting is poor. He improves throughout the movie, but I think he is the weakest actor throughout.Overall though, I was very please. You get a lot of Star Wars background theory and you get to see what drove Anakin to become Darth. It also gives you some insight into the human spirit and the lengths we go to for the ones we love. Treachery and deceit are highly present throughout the film. It becomes difficult at times to tell if people are acting on their own or if they are being manipulated by Palpatine. The story I think flows very smoothly and the you can see all of the plot and story lines weave together. The writing is really well done.The acting is as good as you might expect from a sci-fi movie. Visually and audialy (sp?) the movie was phenomenal. The music is always very good in Star Wars and it is often described as a musical drama. The pictures and special effects are all very good. In the first fight scene, it is a little hard to follow the fighters. The light sabers also looked a little different than the first 2 movies. As always, the sword fights are a little tough to follow because of the speed, but they are fun none the less.I was very excited when General Grievous busted out the 4 light sabers (although we were confused why he had a cough.) And you get to see Palpatine work with the saber. It is odd to think that Windu and Obi-Won would have just actually finished there fights without hesitating then the whole affair would be taken care of. But Windu stops to wait and Obi-Won just assumes Anakin will die.I also liked the way that Padme & Anakin's lives become intertwined as they die. You can see very clearly, as the movie ends, that when Obi-Won says to Luke, ""Vader killed and murdered your father,"" that Vader really is reborn out of Anakin. Also they way the battles between Yoda & Palpatine and Obi-Won & Anakin are intertwined together is very nice.I really like Star Wars. The stories work well together and the movies are visually impressive. Most importantly, I think, is the way the music tells a story. The way the death march plays at the right times, and in the final light saber battle, the theme from the last battle in Phantom Menace starts to play.I have more thoughts that I will share later but it is late."	5.0	Star Wars Rocks!	2007-07-06	3	2	1

I think he should stick with what he knows, and leave the complexity of character development to a more qualified candidate. Overall, this movie was, in fact, entertaining; but not for ""good movie-making"" reasons. Unlike the last two ""prequals"", I'm not feeling cheated out of my hard-earned money, but, somehow, I was left dumbfounded by the way the story had to be compressed to make way for more action scenes. I felt as if I was watching a movie, and the person next to me was consistantly fast-forwarding to the ""good parts."" In a way, though, this did spare me the agony of sitting through more of that overbearingly, god-awful dialogue! So, in conclusion, I guess I couldn't be happier the story wasn't extended more.

Without spoiling it for you, I will say Lucas went down a predictable path, but one which forever changes your view of Vader in Episode IV through Episode VI.I can get past some of the stiff performances among the cast, a small slow spot in the middle of the movie, and any unfulfilled false expectations I may have had. I'm gonna give it 5 stars. But no matter how much anyone picks apart this movie, it is still an absolute must see. And furthermore it must be seen on the big screen, or on your big screen TV.	5.0	Annakin Becomes the Big Man- Darth Vader	2006-04-26	2	1	1

The prequels were largely attempts to make money off the first trilogy, and this does that. Good music. Definitely the least kid-friendly of the films; the burning scene where Anakin gets burned is pretty graphic, and his killing lots of other people is awful dark. If you're getting this, chances are it's because you love Star Wars or are completing a collection, so you're probably getting it anyway.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A33XHXRTRZOQ12	"Photoscribe ""semi-renaissance man"""	"Why are the later episodes of the ""Star Wars"" series being subjected to such brutal criticism when anybody could tell that it will be DOOMSDAY before another filmmaker comes close to equaling these great movies for visuals, certain actors' dramatic prowess, (remember, these people are often working against a blue or greenscreen with absolutely nothing concrete to play against!) or just plain overall production values? Spielberg wouldn't have a prayer....Paul Verhoeven left the realm of possibility when he came out with ""Showgirls""...Only Ridley Scott would have a chance of even coming close to making a movie equal to or approaching the ""Star Wars"" series, and HE hasn't produced a really good ""Ridley Scott"" movie since ""Gladiator""!I can say, without feeling foolish, that this is easily one of the best episodes visually, and the second or third best episode, dramatically, of the series. I was surprised at how good the visuals were for III! The different planet settings, the further adventures of the Coruscant landscape, the different bastions for the warring factions, and those SWORDFIGHTS!! If you are an optically oriented person, you will have no end to stimuli from this movie! Dramatically, the last half hour of the movie cannot be beaten anywhere in the series by anything but ""New Hope"". I won't ruin the ending for you, but suffice it to say that the impact of NOT having anything resembling a happy ending for this movie will remind you of only one other movie, ""Alien 3"", and sci fi film fans will remember what happened there. This movie does NOT end well!In all honesty, I can tell you, though...Annakin doesn't seem to have THAT MUCH of a reason to go to the dark side. I think he is more or less mentally FORCED over to the dark side by the overhwelming power of Chancellor Palpatine. The change in character is just too dramatic! The lead-in to all this, however, will have you spellbound as you wonder just how Lucas could squeeze all this into just two hours. You also wonder why the type of cavalier put downs of the latter episodes in this series aren't being leveled at such hacks as Spielberg or Peter Hyams,two of the WORST sci fi movie directors I've ever seen!Again, Natalie Portman's acting is good...especially when Padme discovers that Annakin HAS turned...Ewan McGregor finally redeems himself as Obi Wan, though there is a scene where he bellows to Annakin in a rather phony sounding voice. It's amazing, though, how they age him with the makeup. He actually doesn't look or act anything like the real Ewan MacGregor. Another criticism I have against the film, and I have MANY others, (and not only for this episode,) is the hokey-looking makeup applied to Ian McDiarmid after his evil nature is revealed on his face.However, when you get right down to it...NO movie or series of movies has had such a total immersion of visuals, sci-fi settings and art direction to offer the audience, and for that alone Lucas should be commended. What will always disturb me, however, is why he sees fit to kill off all the good women in the series...Beru, Schmi, Padme....! If the series ever continues, the actress portraying any future iteration of Leia had better be on her P's and Q's!In fact, if anything has produced the negative fan press the latter episodes have been getting, I would imagine that could be it!"	5.0	Unreal!	2005-07-27	0	0	0

There used to be a time when Starwars meant good times at the movies.  Sadly those days are gone.  You can ohh and ahh all you like over the visuals (which are admittedly incredible) but underneath all the glitz and glamour, is a horribly, horribly weak story.  I personally compare this movie (The most epic disapointment in film-perhaps ever) to a cake that has all the ingredients to be wonderful but ends up getting burnt in the oven.  Any skill or talent Mr. Lucas had as a storywriter has wasted away under his child-like wonder with special effects.  Seriously.  Don't kid yourself.  Did anyone actually buy Anakin's fall to the darkside?  I mean please.  One minute he's a happy go lucky ace pilot newly wed, next minute he's loping kid's heads off.  Even in theory-If the audience is supposed to see his viewpoint and feel sympathy for his reasons, everything hinges on the audience understanding how he feels about Padme.  In order for the audience to do this, we must also feel strongly for Padme as a character.  Did anyone give a Sh** about Padme?  Natalie Portman was awful in this movie and thus Padme suffered as a character. Hell I wanted her to die after uttering god awful lines such as ""I won't die in childbirth Ani I promise you.""  But I don't blame this problem on Nat's acting skills however, instead I blame George Lucas for his failed direction.  But then again, it's not like we couldn't see it coming.  Just look at Episode One.  Episode Three is far, far ""Prettier"" than Epi 1 but ever bit as weak.  How the mighty have fallen.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A33SFSEVHL5SHK	Pileated	"Recall what Lucas himself has said about his relationship with the Hollywood power/money structure: in his early films he struggled against an ""evil"" corporate structure that tried to control and hinder his creative energies and goals; once the first three Star Wars films became block busters he was able to bankroll his own projects, set up his own corporate structure.  In other words, Lucas himself was Anakin, now Darth Vader, and the filming of Episodes I-III was more about that power dynamic and Lucas's greed than it was about film making.  Star Wars fans can hope he'll one day be ""saved"" a la Anakin and Luke.  Episodes VII-IX have been supposedly canned, but who knows what Lucas will decide he wants his legacy to be.Episode III is vastly better than II, but that's not much of a compliment.  The same nails-on-blackboard problems remain:  terrible dialogue, weak script, unmotivated actors, over-reliance on special effects, and a seemingly complete rejection of the things that made the first three films so endearing to Star Wars fans.  Natalie Portman is all but wasted in this film, and that is something for which I can't forgive Lucas.  There is a scene in the Bonus Material DVD---cut from the film---that actually shows Portman's character Padme involved in the political discussions out of which the Rebel Alliance would be founded, showing the character as a concerned, dynamic, adult woman.  Lucas cut this out in favor of showing Padme as utterly devoid of self motivation---after having been a queen and a senator---completely controlled by and dependent upon her boyfriend and unable to see the obvious in his behavior.  (Recall that Anakin admits to her in Episode II that he has committed mass murder on Tatooine and all she can do is feel sorry for HIM.)  In Lucas's view, women are models upon which fashion designers can hang their creations.Considering this film's plot---Anakin's descent into hell---our explanation for his transformation is almost completely bankrupt.  He has dreams he'll lose Padme.  He's not the Jedi he's supposed to be.  The Jedi Council masters are ""unfair.""  Good grief, is this all Lucas can come up with?  Even so, in the hands of a more competent actor (Hayden Christensen remains an unfortunate choice for this role), the lame script's characterization might still have been persuasive, but that would have required the careful, patient direction of an interested, thoughtful director.  It's a relief when petulant Anakin is absorbed by the black plastic and leather of Vader and we're given the expert voice acting of James Earl Jones. The best acting in the movie is delivered by Ewan McGregor; his ability to put at least a bit of a playful or dramatic spin on the worst of Lucas's comic book dialogue is truly proof of his talent.The action sequences in this movie are good, yet Lucas can't manage to sell even this aspect of his creation as well as Peter Jackson does with his adaptation of THe Lord of the Rings. The opening sequence's crash landing of Obi Wan's and Anakin's star fighters in the hanger bay of General Grievous's ship is Lucas at his best and worth many viewings.As disappointing as Anakin's descent is depicted in this film, as downright painful as most of the dialogue is, I have to say that the film's denouement, in which the twins are delivered to their foster parents, is surprisingly moving.  But the effect is achieved not so much by its artfulness but because we know the story so well; and Lucas wisely (for once) chose to show rather than to tell.  When Leia and Luke are brought to their respective foster mothers there is none of Lucas's heavy handed dialogue to ruin it.  It works because we know that the beautiful Alps-like setting in which Leia will grow up will later be destroyed by the first death star.  And it works because we know as we see Luke's young and hopeful foster parents staring off into the double sunset of Tatooine, reflecting Mark Hamill's memorable scene in A New Hope, that they will give their lives protecting his.It seems the best that Lucas can do now is to quote his own early efforts---when he was the restless, idealistic Anakin/Luke rather than the resigned and self-absorbed Vader."	3.0	Who Is Really Beneath that Mask?	2007-12-10	9	5	4

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A13DQTXG02HZC1	Ping Lim	I do not consider myself a fan of Star Wars but to understand how effective the saga is, I have watched the original Part 4 to 6 and then, watching the prequels, which are Part 1 to 3.  Now that I have done that, I have gone the other way all over again, that is, Part 4 to 6 again.  Originally, the intention was to jog my memory of what the twins did to save the whole universe and thus, fulfilling their father's supposedly destiny but later, I did the rewatching just to see how well George Lucas was able to tie the old and the new together.  The anwer is simple:  seamlessly.  Last night, sitting there watching the original offering, I couldn't help but noticing that the Star Wars remained ageless.  The visuals were as vivid and as pertinent in 1977 as it is now.  Nowadays, people might be critical that George Lucas hasn't done enough to push to envelope further but truthfully, his seed idea made him an Empire, an Empire that has had him made revenues sufficient enough to create his own studio at the outskirts of San Francisco and a special effects division which has since been doing exactly that for Hollywood movies.  Renee Zewelgger said it well that to be able to do the job that she always dreamt of is a joy but to be able to do her dream job and got paid for it is highly satisfying.  I think the same applies to George Lucas.  People might also be critical that Star Wars saga is a eye-candy offering.  Hey, that's true too but this eye-candy offering would most certainly outlast all of us, and people are still going to talk about it long, long time later and it even outlasts those arty-farty movies.  Not a small feat who simply wants to actualise his dream!  To be more specific about this Part 3, forget about the corny dialogues, forget about the wooden actings for some, the movie is a necessary evil to link the present to the past or the past to the future, depending upon from which perspectives are you seeing it.  Highly recommended and a must-see.  One other thing, Star Wars saga is only half-cooked without John William's music score!	4.0	Necessary Evil	2005-05-28	5	1	4

Appropriate is right, for this spectacular film completes the star wars saga and bridges the gap between the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy.Star Wars is at its finest here.  Still retaining the childish humor of C-3PO and R2D2, it succeeds as a dramatic tragedy as well as a succession of the classic films. Hayden Christensen, that pretty but lamentably bad actor, does remarkably well for what we have seen of him.  A great portion of his lines still come off wooden, but in the final hour of this film we see why he was chosen for the role of Anakin.  We may have thought him merely whiny and roguish in AOTC, but in ROTS we see his complexity, his struggling, his hate.  Natalie Portman, surprisingly enough, performs memorably in her final scene with Christensen.  Finally, Ewan McGregor, firmly settled into his role as Obi-Wan, gives us an admirable performance as the sometimes witty, ever-wise hero.  At first viewing he came off to me as having too many one-liners; however, this is typical of Star Wars and can be overlooked by fans.  Not all is perfect; Samuel L. Jackson, though his role as Mace was an important one in this story, gave a performance, in my opinion, terribly awkward and not up to par with his acting in the last two movies.  Finally, Ian McDiarmid plays Palpatine with his usual insidiousness, plus extra melodrama which you may or may not like according to personal taste, but not over-the-top for Star Wars.The music was brilliant as well.  Williams made good use of old material; his placements of the Imperial March will give you goosebumps.  The visuals are stunning and shimmering as ever.  Raging lava and flames capture the emotion during the climactic duel at Mustafar, and a pale dawn leaves us with new hope as baby Luke is delivered to his relations.Star Wars has always been a marvel: childish, funny, and adventurous.  ROTS, however, has shown us the depth and complexity of the saga, and increased its worth greatly in my mind.  It is a tragedy in every aspect, and the viewer is swept up into it by the music, the visuals, and even the acting.  I cried on seven different occasions on my first and second viewing, and I still have trouble containing them during the Mustafar sequence.  But please, do not be tempted, after watching this, to see it as the end of Star Wars - a new hope lies ahead!"	5.0	The Bridge	2005-11-14	15	9	6

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	The Star Wars saga comes to a close with Star Wars III-Revenge Of The Sith.  In the movie, Anakin Skywalker's (Hayden Christensen) destiny is finally fulfilled as he turns to the dark side and becomes Darth Vader.  Anakin is troubled by dreams that his secret wife Padme (Natalie Portman) who is pregnant will die while giving birth.  Anakin & Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor) open the movie by rescuing Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from General Grevious.  There Anakin has a fateful battle with Count Dooku (Christopher Lee).  Anakin is further anger by being rejected by the Jedi Council for the rank of Jedi Master.  Obi-Wan is sent off to destroy General Grievous (where he will meet up with the Wookies and Chewbacca is introduced) While Obi-Wan is away, Palpatine, who is deformed by Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) before killing him, seduces Anakin to the dark side by showing that only by embracing the dark side can he save Padme's life.  Anakin embraces the dark side and becomes a dark lord of the sith with a new title, Darth Vader.  In one of the film's truly disturbing scenes, Vader goes to the Jedi Temple and slaughters the young padawans.  While the slaughter is not shown, the resulting carnage is and it is profound as to the change Anakin has gone through.  Obi-Wan finds Vader and their climatic light saber duel on a volcanic planet is one of the best scenes from any of the Star Wars movies.  The movie ends with Anakin's dreams coming true.  Padme dies while giving birth to twins, Luke & Leia, and we see the scarred and virtually destroyed remains of Anakin turned into the black armored Darth Vader.  When Vader breathes that first breath, it is a brilliant movie moment.  While the film did not live up to all the hype, it is still a very good movie and far and away the best of the prequels.	4.0	Last Piece Of The Star Wars Puzzle	2005-10-28	6	4	2

M Simon ""El Simon Asombroso"""	"It's the ""eagerly anticipated"" video release of the last Star Wars episode, just in time for the Holidays.  And, honestly, it's about as disappointing as the film itself.Let's not be totally negative.  The DVD is excellent in quality- I heard and saw little distortion.  Watching the film on a big screen at home is very satisfying.Some of the extra features are disappointing, however.  The ""making of"" feature spends--get this-- about an HOUR telling about a one-minute scene.  Do you need to know who brought sandwiches to the set?On the other hand, there are six deleted scenes which will be a ""must"" for the completist crowd.For those not yet having seen the film, we will assume that you have already seen the other installments in the series (else this episode would just be baffling).  I repeat my review of the movie itself:It's ""Revenge of the Sith,"" the new Star Wars installment, and either the sixth, last, or third chapter, depending on where you begin counting. Watching these, I've gone from energetic youth into cranky middle age and I hope to heavens that Lucas will not make three more or I'll be an old age pensioner! I had to go to this opus for 'closure' and so will almost anyone else. Presumably, the only first-time viewers will be 13-year old boys.Not that 'Sith' is all bad. Of course it has great special effects! One star for them! But no stars for yet another bombastic 1 billion-piece John Williams orchestral soundtrack.Unfortunately, Sith also has such stilted dialogue that it's almost excruciating to listen to! ""I believe in the Republic and Democracy,"" is uttered by all the good guys (and Anakin until he becomes Darth V). The dialogue is pretty predictable. And, in fact, that's the main plot weakness--no surprises: There are fewer twists and turns than the train track across Australia's Nullarbor Plain.Sith tries to sew together too many loose ends, and fails. Contradictions galore creep in: Medical science saves Anakin Skywalker when he gets his body turned into toasted cheese at a volcano (in a scene that, apparently, most parents don't mind their tots seeing!) but can't save Padme in routine childbirth.Yes, the violence is exciting and fun. One star added for that! I almost added a third star just because there were none of those murderous woodchucks in babushka scarves from Return of the Jedi! But then I almost took off a star for the dumb names like Senator Organic, Count Doofus, Darth Insidious, and General Grievous, or something really close to that!Sadly, the best acting comes from robots and animated figures. Christopher Lee, at age 80, is way sexier and a way better actor than anyone else, and gets killed off in the first microseconds of the film. His character (Count Cameo, apparently) appears on-screen only slightly longer than Saruman showed up in ""Return of the King.""Still, there are moments.  I mean, who doesn't enjoy watching Yoda kick some butt?"	3.0	Sith-ing through the ruins--2.5 stars	2005-11-01	2	2	0

It has its flaws as all George Lucas movies do but Lucas demonstrates just what a genius he is.  This movie is just as good as the OT and is second only to ""Empire Strikes Back.""ROTS opens up 3 years after AOTC.  The Clone Wars are raging and the Republic is waning.  Anakin and Obi-Wan are on a mission to rescue Chancellor Palpatine and Anakin proves himself the heroic figure he's been prophesized to be.  He returns to find his secret wife Senator Padme Amidala pregnant, then starts having nightmares about her dying in childbirth.  Afraid of losing her the same way he lost his mother he agonizes over what to do about it while becoming frustrated with the Jedi Council for not trusting him.  His fear of history repeating itself with Padme, his desire to protect her turns into a quest for greater power.  Dismayed by the Jedi Anakin increasingly turns to Palpatine who insidiously manipulates him. *no pun intended*  Anakin, although trying to believe in the Jedi feels pushed away at every turn and when Palpatine offers him a way to save Padme's life there's no going back after fatal choices made by Anakin and the Jedi Council.The movie shows the Jedi Purge (with incredible music I might add) and the final transformation of the Republic to a totalitarian Empire.  It also shows the humanity and tragedy in the Anakin character.  He's the tragic hero as well as the villain although he's becoming the evil being we all know him to be in the OT, he's a victim too.The Obi-Wan/Anakin battle is amazing to watch as two characters who were brothers now turn on each other.  The battle is not just good vs evil but all the tension locked up between them finally coming out.Generally speaking all the actors really shine in their roles.  Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiamid especially.  Hayden really comes to life as Anakin.  When I watch the OT I can't help but imagine him in the Vader suit.  Natalie is okay and although I love her character Padme, at times I feel she can't use Lucas' bad screenwriting as an excuse for her awkward delivery at times.  Nevertheless you really feel for her as a woman who watches everything she worked for and believed in crumble then her unbearable grief when she realizes what the man she loves has become.  Say what you want about the couple but Anakin and Padme truly define tragic love.  Their relationship has considerable effects for the galaxy, that are felt even after the OT if you read the books about Han/Leia's children and Luke's son who become Jedi Knights after ROTJ.Although downright depressing at times, this movie is so powerful and sets the stage very nicely for the original trilogy.  George Lucas ties up all the loose ends.  At the last scene it's bittersweet because the saga is now complete but sad because of the tragedy for every character involved.  Despite the criticism against Attack of the Clones I always loved the movie and I think ROTS will make viewers appreciate TPM and AOTC more.Now for the flaws.  George Lucas admits he can't write dialogue and we certainly know he can't so there's no reason to belabor it more.  There are cringe-worthy moments in this movie, most of them in the Anakin and Padme scenes which is really unfortunate.  I feel for the actors there's no excuse for the pathetic dialogue he gave Hayden and Natalie in some of their scenes.The music is excellent, really brings everything to life and the visuals are absolutely breathtaking.  The extras featured on the second DVD are nice too.  You get the trailers, TV spots, documentaries and deleted scenes.  There's 3 scenes involving a subplot with Padme, Bail Organa, a young Mon Mothma and other senators forming a delegation of the ""loyal opposition"" to the Chancellor which I loved.  It was cut to keep the story focused on Anakin but since these characters lay the foundation for the political aspect of the Rebel Alliance that Leia becomes involved in, I thought it was important for future SW viewers that it be there."	5.0	The saga is now complete!!!

Although the two are excited, her pregnancy could also pose a problem for Anakin as a Jedi if anyone ever discovered it was his child.  With the weight of that problem, Anakin's terrible dreams of Padme dying in childbirth, and Anakin's constant annoyance with his fellow Jedis, he begins to consider an option that once seemed so impossible - the Dark Side.This is the final ""Star Wars"" movie, and it was very obvious while watching the movie that George Lucas was looking forward to ending the saga.  It definitely wasn't his best work.For one thing, Padme's lines were pathetic.  I mean, Natalie Portman's acting is pathetic enough with having to have pathetic lines to match.  ""Anakin, you're breaking my heart""  ""Anakin, hold me.""  Does that sound like a corny, badly written soap opera to you or is it just me?And second, yes we are returning to Padme again...her whole pregnancy made for uncomfortable mushy, hugging, soap opera scenes between her and Anakin.  Nothing sincere, just lines to get the point across, I suppose.  Not to mention that Luke and Leia looked awfully healthy for babies that were delivered very early.None of the actors excluding Chancellor Palpatine were particularly good, although Anakin did have a FEW shining moments. (Mostly he was just whiny and moody, though.) Yoda was good but he doesn't count, because he's computer-animated.The storyline was okay.  The battle sequences were fairly interesting although the opening scene was actually more exciting in the ""Lego Star Wars"" video game, which is saying a lot.  The special effects were good, but aren't all special effects these days?Overall a good movie, DEFINITELY NOT A FAVORITE, but it held my attention.  It really just lacked quite a bit.  It could have been better.  It's one of those that it's decent while you're watching it but once it's over you realize how poorly done it was.  And I still have a few questions...1. How can Leia remember her mother if her mother died in childbirth?2. How can prettyboy Anakin grow up to be overweight with totally different coloring? (See ""Return of the Jedi"")3.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A292YWWNFVSIWY	Publius	"Yes, Episode III is better then Episode I or II, but it still cannot hold a candle to the original trilogy.  For the first half of ""Revenge"", the viewer is essentially watching a cartoon with live actors, ala Mary Poppins.  Yes, this is a sci-fi movie, but at the same time, the intelligent viewer does not feel emotionally involved in something that they know is entirely filmed on green screen and added in later.  And speaking of emotional involvement, the dialogue scenes between Christensen and Portman have not improved since `Attack.""  Lines like ""You are so beautiful!"" with Padme responding with ""It's only because I'm so in love"" just won't cut it for a movie that has pretensions of respectability.  The relationship between the two of them is arguably the foundation of the entire trilogy, and if people do not believe that relationship is solid, then the rest becomes a farce.  Another problem is the overemphasis on CGI.  Joseph Campbell, who served as a mentor to a young Lucas, in his famous interviews with Bill Moyers said the essential choice that every modern individual makes is whether to be a partner with technology or allow technology to eat you up.  In the original trilogy Darth Vader was swallowed up by technology thus becoming more ""machine then man.""  In much the same way, Lucas has become more ""machine then man"" as the new trilogy is really just an example of great CGI cinematography accompanied by wooden acting and an obviously predictable plot.  In the original trilogy, Luke turned off the scanner on his X-Wing to destroy the death star.  As Luke did not become overly dependent on technology to accomplish the defeat of the empire, Lucas should not have become overly dependent on technology in these movies.  However, there was no one to tell Lucas that he was making a mistake.  His Skywalker Ranch is filled with yes-men that do nothing but encourage negative group think and the results of this milieu are these dubious prequels.  George Lucas' real empire are the ancillary products and marketing that Lucas has wisely controlled the rights to.  He is now essentially a businessman that presides over a vast array of merchandise, toys, video games and intellectual property.  The movies themselves have just become one component in the Lucas army.  Unfortunately, for the fan that grew up with these movies, the results of these movies are unsatisfying.  As an afterthought, maybe the kids, who are now adults, that grew up with these movies expected too much!  Maybe Lucas thought that the CGI would make up for the storyline that everybody knew the ending to.  So one cannot blame Lucas for taking the risk, and the truth of the matter was, it really wasn't a risk at all.  These movies were going to make money no matter what!  Thus, the fans of the trilogy are left unsatisfied, while the Lucas machine continues to rack in the money.  The bottom line: don't expect anything from ""Revenge"" that you didn't get in the first two."	1.0	A Fitting End	2005-11-07	68	51	17

This episode (Three) is perhaps the most disturbing, complex and satisfying of all. The original three episodes, made from 1977 through 1983 are wonderful, so you will not want to miss out on seeing the complete series. Take out a day to watch the entire set.George Lucas has taken it upon himself to enrich the lives of children and the young at heart with this enomously successful and earth-shattering artistic venture. The themes therein are as true, and perhaps even more pertinent today than when he began the project almost thirty years ago. The Jedi may be technically his creation, but their message is for all of us.I highly recommend every family to at some point acquire a copy of their own complete set of the Star Wars saga, all six, gorgeous episodes.	5.0	Magnificent	2006-01-08	5	3	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3B1XRW9HIGYQB	P. Woods	Well actually this film gets 4.75 stars because this is such a fantastic film. Many have waited for this for years and now they finally have it. The saga finishes nicely with this third installment of the Star wars movies.I don't think I really need to explain the plot, but I can tell you that this film is defiantely darker, more violent and just plainj better than the other films (episode 1 and 2). The special effects are the same as usual, and used very well in the action scenes. Speaking of which, the action in this is fantastic, with about 5 lightsaber battles and lots of battle sequences taking place on lots of different planets. The film is also very tragic, for example when the jedi are all killed the film becomes quite serious and darker.We are i9ntroduced to a new character in the film called General Greivus (however spelt). However, in my opinion, he isn't one of the greatest star wars villains, and also he is hardly in the film, but there is one great lightsaber battle with him and Obi-won (Ewan McGreggor).However, there is one thing I cannot get over about the film: The ending. To me, the ending was over before I knew it. The ending lightsaber battle between Anakin and Obi-won was not all that great. It was well tought out, but it just didn't grab my attention. It was promised to be a 12-minute lightsaber fight, but it definately wasn't that long. The other thing is that when Anakin gets the Darth Vader suit put on him, it happens to quickly and it's like basically at the end of the movie, and I would have expected a better scene to show how he first gets the suit. But, I just felt that the ending could have been another 15-20 minutes longer.But still, the movie is great at showing how Anakin turns for good at the start, to evil at the end. And the film is very clever the way it leads up to part IV.So, if you like Star wars, you must see this, as it is fantastic, but, the ending could have been a little better.	4.0	Fantastic, but the ending is horribly rushed	2005-05-20	4	3	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2ZVEGQWG4TFT5	Queen of Annwen	"After several disapointments in the previous installment of the star wars series, Revenge of the Sith roars back to give us a fitting, if not tearful, conclusion to the classics we know and love.The story brings together all the classical elements of fantasy/sci-fi such as treachery, heartbreak, war, unrest, and of course, good vs evil.THough some of the acting on the part of the cast may be a bit mediocre at times, the visuals are utterly stunning and absolutely convincing. Once again, we revisit this world only to find it continues to expand with all knew locations and surprises.The story line itself (not the dialogue) is a very touching one, to me anyway. Anakin's struggle to save his wife, I think was a noble one, and his failure incredibly difficult. The sequence known as the ""Immolation SCene"" or ""the Slaughter of the Jedi"" makes me cry every time, as I am a fan and have read many of the novels containing these characters. It was very fun to see chewbacca appear, as well as seeing Yoda arriving on Dagoba.Overall, a fitting conclusion worth seeing and owning."	5.0	Evil will emerge in a truely dark and heartwrenching tale!	2006-01-02	4	3	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1LZITS6DSMAEH	Quigley	"I won't blast George Lucas again for severely wounding his universally loved ""Star Wars"" franchise. Now that the final film has been released, let's point out the bad points first:1. Acting - not only does this film carry on the tradition of the lead actors being totally wooden (all except Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, and Yoda), but certain actors have gotten worse. For instance, Mace Windu (played horribly by the terribly miscast Samuel L. Jackson) becomes less likeable as the movie goes on. I was getting the impression that Jackson did this trilogy for the hefty paycheck. Hayden Christensen as the tortured Anakin Skywalker redeems himself somewhat from his atrocity in ""Attack of the Clones""; in other words, he got more of his scenes right. That still doesn't dismiss the fact that he cannot act if his life depended on it. But the all-time worst acting in this franchise goes to Natalie Portman. Why is no one acknowledging the fact that she did so horrendously awful in this film? I'm guessing people want to cling to her few good performances in other films. I mean, honestly, I was laughing my head off during the Mustafar scene when she confronts Anakin. That was without a doubt one of, if not the worst-acted scenes I have ever seen; it doesn't just have to do with the fact the script was made out of crap in the first place, but she and the others did hardly anything to make it semi-acceptable.  Sooner or later, people will realize her ""acting"" was disgusting. I would have considered making this movie a favorite had it not been so miscast. Nice job, Lucas.2. Script - horrendous. There were very few times the actors made their lines believable, the only ones coming close were Ewan McGregor and the excellent Ian McDiarmid.In the scenes that were supposed to have a huge emotional impact, the script prevented that from happening. I would have wanted to be moved by the film, but alas, I was not. Not to mention the way the actors delivered the lines; when you get a pair of actors lacking talent and feed them the lines they spoke, you will undoubtedly hear more public criticism than grammatical errors on the news.3. CGI Effects - I'm not slamming the effects themselves (""Sith"" had some of the best I have ever seen), but Lucas did the unwise (again) and had them in almost every scene. Bad move. By the end, even I, a die-hard fan of computer graphis in the movies, was tired of them. They overwhelmed the movie to the point where the final fight (overrated in it being called the greatest sword-fight ever) didn't really mean anything significant. We should have been saying ""this fight will go down as one of the greatest ever filmed,"" but many of us were saying, ""Oh great, another saber-fight."" If Lucas had done the wise thing of combining different technologies so each one was getting a fair share of screen-time, more people would have probably not been exhausted by the end.When last I looked, style over substance was not something people wanted.Now that the bad points have been covered, I'll acknowledge the action scenes. The beginning battle was pretty incredible: seeing it on screen was thrilling, and a really promising way to open the film. Not only was the battle good, but certain characters have moments of glory thay you won't forget: when Yoda walks in to confront Palpatine and wastes two guards using the Force without any effort, there were cheers and laughs from the audience. The action moment that I especially was stunned by was the fight between the cyborg General Grievous and the ever-faithful Obi-Wan Kenobi; when he pulls out his four arms and shouts attack, after ""unsheathing"" the lightsabers, Obi-Wan grins, as if to say, ""Bring it on""! That moment, and when Grievous spins his weapons, was memorable. But the moment that few will ever forget was the scene that Lucas nailed nearly flawless: the first breath of Darth Vader. That moment will likely go down as being one of cinema history's most powerful moments. The minute that helmet went down, and all was silent, and the breath came forth, I almost had a heart attack; it was overwhelmingly incredible at the scene's spine-tingling power. If you don't like anything else in the film, then see it for that one scene. For those who want a memorable time at the movies, then don't miss ""Revenge of the Sith"""	5.0	It is a very flawed film, but the action more than makes up for it	2005-12-31	4	1	3

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ALQ1M1CUD5C19	rage55	"Here are the main points that struck me, in roughly the order they appear in the movie.Buzz Droids:Good idea, but they should have been no threat against a Jedi.  Why didn't they just use the force and push them off their planes?R2D2 the Toaster Pop Tart:What can I say?  They needed a better way to get him out of the ship.  Besides, how does he get back in?  The Naboo fighter planes of Episode 1 showed how he got in and out, and it was pretty neat.  But this was just plain embarrassing.  Plus, it seems that R2D2 had a little too much caffeine -- to have him zipping around seemed out of character.General Grievous:I liked this guy.  I wish he would have been introduced toward the end of Episode 2, and we could have seen him kicking some serious butt.  Then his character would have fit very nicely into Episode 3.Incompetent Jedi Masters:Four Jedi Masters go to arrest the chancellor.  And he kills two of them before they even raise their light sabers in self-defense.  And the third one goes down seconds later.  What's up with that?Multiple Light Sabers:In both Episode 2 and Episode 3, whenever a character has more than one light saber, it seems that it's only purpose is to get chopped up so that each character is reduced to only one.  The people with the great imaginations that gave us such a rich Star Wars universe cannot come up with a decent dual and martial arts moves with more than two light sabers?  Obi-Wan and Anakin vs. Count Dooku, quickly reduces to just Anakin.  And Obi-Wan vs. General Grievous should have been amazing, but Obi-Wan just starts hacking limbs off, very disappointing.  The best light saber duel of all of Star Wars was with Darth Maul.Anakin's New Powers:I didn't see any.  He talks about it, how turning to dark side and doing all kinds of evil deeds has increased his power, but we don't see it.  Even at the end, he seems evenly matched against Obi-Wan, I didn't see any additional power/strength.The Emperor really doesn't do anything overpowering to merit Anakin's allegiance either.  There needed to be some great event that binds the two of them together.  I guess the death of Mace Windu was supposed to be that watershed event.  We needed to have the Emperor show us how insignificant a Jedi Master was, with a clear and decisive victory over Mace Windu that merits Anakin's respect and awe.  We didn't get that.  Count Dooku should have hung around till mid-movie, and Anakin should have killed him specifically to take his place as a Sith Lord.  That would have tied in better with Luke, Vadar, and the Emperor in Return of the Jedi.Padme:She didn't seem to have anything to do in this movie except be pregnant.  Her few speaking lines were terrible dialog.  Which is a shame because I really like Natalie Portman.  I heard there were suppose to be a couple of scenes of her meeting with Senator Organa and a few other people, where they discuss the formation of a rebellion.  It would have been good to see that.The scene of her and Anakin looking at each other from across the city was probably the best interlude of all the Star Wars films.  I liked it even better than Luke watching the dual sunset on Tatooine, and that was excellent.I would have liked her demise to be because of complications caused by Anakin strangling her, not just giving up the will to live, that was out of character for the very strong Padme of Episode 2.The Emperor:When the Emperor said to Yoda, ""I've been waiting a long time for this..."" I thought to myself he needs to add the words ""my little green friend"", and he did!  Maybe me and the Emperor think too much alike.  When the Emperor was laughing all though the life and death battle Yoda, was when we saw his true contempt for everyone and everything.The Mask Descending:This scene worked for me.  The look of fear on Anakin's face spoke volumes as it came down.  It was a prison, and he was being imprisoned in the suit.  It added to the tragic nature of his fall.  His first steps and words did invoke the images of Frankenstein.  It was awkward and clumsy, adjusting to his new ""body"" as it were.  It was as comic as it was tragic.  It's too bad the most of the public think of Mel Brooks' instead of Kenneth Brannaugh's interpretation of FrankensteinObi-Wan:The growth we see in Obi-Wan through episodes 1, 2, and 3 is really the type of growth Lucas was trying to develop for Anakin.  He missed it by one Character.  We see Obi-Wan from Padawan, to Knight, to Master, with accompanying maturity at each stage.  Nearly every scene with him in it worked.  He needed more time to digest the security tapes showing Anakin attacking the temple, that was rushed.  A revelation like that required more time for a response.  His talk with Padme, when she realizes he's going to kill Anakin was possibly the best dialog of the movie for either of them.  And his lament to Anakin when he leaves him to die was heartfelt and tragic."	5.0	My Little Green Friend...	2005-06-14	12	7	5
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A24O6QA28LM4P7	"randomone ""Offbeat Film Fan"""	As in the long history of many trilogies the cardinal rule that the third one always sucks generally is correct.  Well, even Lucas can't pull this one out.  Short of the third installment of the Lord of the Rings every trilogy I have seen lately has sucked.Upon leaving the theater I first thought that the nasty taste in my mouth was the ridiculously salted popcorn available at my local theater.  I mean seriously, I know they want to sell their $4.00 beverages but come on ease up on those hammers.As it turns out even my disillusioned 11 year old nephew was not even fooled by this stinker.  About 2/3s of the way through the movie all I could think about was the last chapter in the Matrix.  You know the one where a group of frantic writers finally realize that they have 60 minutes worth of loose ends to tie up and only 30 minutes of movie left.I will say it again; don't leave everything until the third movie.  Most of this stuff could have bled backward into the second movie and not have changed the impact or prevented people from paying to see the third movie.Did the movie suck?  Well, I guess it really depends on what suck scale you are using.  If this movie stood alone without any reference to the Star Wars saga I would probably give it a 3 stars.  But since we all know that this movie has to be viewed as 1/3 of a larger movie I would have to give it 2.Too harsh? Maybe.  But since the fact that I grew up with the first 3 burned into my psyche I am entitled to set my thresholds high.  And since I was reserving judgment on the first 2 parts until the third movie came out; I was expecting so much more.In summary of my opinion, Revenge of the Sith is a decent movie but hardly capable of standing with the original three.	2.0	Annoyed with Yoda's meaningless backward talk, I have become.	2005-08-08	22	9	13

I saw the original in the theater twice back in '77 when I was only 3 years old.  But I cognisent enough to know what I was watching.  Over the years...well decades now, I have enjoyed all the incarnations of the Star Wars universe, from TESB, ROTJ, TPM, AOTC, and even ROTS.  I have also enjoyed numerous SW computer games and SW novels and graphic novels.I just watched ROTS for the first time on DVD on release day and one thing caught my attention while watching this movie.  The editting!  What the tarnation was going on in the editting boothe?  Now I realize that in previous Star Wars movies, especially in ROTJ during the Battle of Endor, there were continued edits back and forth between the space battle, the land battle on Endor, and the Luke/Vader/Emperor showdown on the Death Star, but in ROTS, it seems like there were continued edits back and forth between events that weren't directly related to one another.  For example, the edits during the battles on Kashyyk and Utapau and then back to Coruscant to talk to Yoda and such.  I was like, ""Geez, just stay with one until it's done.""  What I'm saying is that the rapid edits kinda took me out of the scene, so when they went back to it, I felt like that I missed something that took place while we were away.Now with all that said, I still enjoyed ROTS enough to give it 4 stars.  I wished that Lucas had left-in or at least re-inserted some of the deleted scenes for the DVD.  Especially the ones about the creation of the Rebellion and the one with Grievous.  Speaking of Grievous, before the movie came out, I heard that there wasn't much footage of Grievous, but I thought that he got quite a bit of screen time.  I also found it funny that a 98% robot/2% organic being has a emphazema problem.Now what'm waiting for is the eventual CGI Clone Wars cartoon and the live-action TV show to fill in the gaps between II & III, and III & IV respectively."	4.0	Chaotic editting, I believe, ruined what could have been a great movie.	2005-11-02	4	0	4

Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com"""	I was not disappointed, but unfortunately there are no surprises in this one.  Everything is predictable.  But of course several plot elements were inevitable, and this film fills in the missing pieces of the puzzle to make the whole Star Wars series complete, and thus better as a whole, and that's an impressive accomplishment.  Because it lacks anything new (there are no new interesting characters, aliens, or creative space craft), I'm afraid it seems to me the worst of the six Star Wars films, or should I say, the least best.  However, compared to most movies, it's still a 10 (or a five-star movie on Amazon.com). It does live up to expectations and delivers those predictable missing pieces with skill, talent, competence, and more spaceships in the sky. Seeing, for example, how Anakin becomes Darth Vader is intensely dramatic, because it's so well acted, directed, edited, etc., but for now the impact is somewhat damped by foreknowledge.  But I believe that when you can watch the whole series in order Star Wars III may have the most dramatic impact, perhaps in a way similar to the last part of The Empire Strikes Back (which is still my favorite because of all the creativity on Hoth, the asteroids, and so forth).	5.0	Inevitably predictable, delivers to expectations.	2005-05-22	1	1	0

The climactic double duel (won't give it away) is tightly edited. The double death/birth/re-birth finale is also nicely conceived and done. What could have been a disaster of a movie became an intriguing link to the original Star Wars trilogy (still the best because of characters, special effects, and tight editing).Where Lucas mostly fails is the quick turn from Anakin as a conflicted, whining, selfish action hero into a murderous, gullible, and selfish villain. In the space of a few seconds he kneels before a Sith Lord, vowing his allegiance and proceeding to do some very ugly and nasty stuff. Sorry, no matter how much I try to see it from Anakin's perspective, I just don't buy it. We have this Force-blessed, inventive genius but he can't tell when he is being blatantly manipulated? I also don't buy the convenient death at the end. Come on, that person has everything to live for--new lives as well (supposedly) believing that there is some ""good"" in Anakin.Where Lucas succeeds is placing the center of the story onto Obi-Wan's shoulders. He's the hero of the piece whose heart is truly broken. That we believe."	4.0	"""Yippee!"" Lucas back on track."	2005-11-04	6	4	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1ATXGFSAPZX25	"Realist ""Eric G Johnson"""	"Ok, first off, let me address a couple issues.  Out of the nearly 2,000 reviews of this film you will read preceeding mine, you obviously are going to notice that there is a huge division amongst Star Wars fanatics.  Either you accept the new trilogy or you don't.  However, please allow me to get on my ""realist"" soapbox and point out a few things that any person who's not a ""sheep"" should understand, if not agree with 100%.1.  George Lucas has and always will make popcorn movies.  That's his interest, and he's never pretended to be anything more.  Get off his back, he's obviously no Ridley Scott.2.  George Lucas, ""is"" and ALWAYS ""has been"" a complete sell-out.  Why is it only after the new trilogy that people want to label him as such?  From the Original Trilogy, through the Indiana Jones films, through the New Trilogy, every product under the sun has been licensed by Lucas to gain profits.  No one remembers the original Star Wars toys?  The Indiana Jones toy line?  All the clothing, etc, etc?3.  The acting in ALL the Star Wars films was horrible!!!!  Why can't people put nostalgia aside for a second and go back to the Original Trilogy with the same critical eye they used on the New Trilogy.  The dialogue in the Original Trilogy is just as cheesy, if not moreso.  Mark Hamil was horrible in all 3 films.  Even Harrison Ford's performances in those films were the low point of his career!  As illustrated in point #1 above, Lucas is not a great director or writer.  He is an entertainer.4.  There is no way Lucas could have told the prequel story without the use of mass CGI effects.  NO WAY! Moreover, if he had presented the same story with all the ""alien"" characters in just makeup, the films would have been rediculous.  Think the cantina scene from A New Hope.Now, you might be thinking, ""Wow, is this guy even a fan?""  Absolutely!  One of the biggest!  In fact, Lucas has hundreds and hundreds of my hard earned dollars.  I've definitely done my part to keep the Lucasfilm money machine alive and well.  The simple fact is, I'm not naive to it, and I have always accepted it.  I've also just taken the films for what they are.  I'm 28 and it's amazing to me how some people who grew up with the original films like me can still hold the Original Trilogy to the same standard they held it too when there were 8.  ""Star Wars, is the greatest movie ever!!!, Yeah!!!!""  NO IT'S NOT!  It is merely one of the most beloved.  There is a difference.Now on to my short, but honest review.  This is one of the best films in the entire saga, in fact it may be ""the"" best in the entire saga.  I think I've ranted long enough so let me just close by ranking the films in the saga as I see them:1.  The Empire Strikes Back-Flawlessly entertaining.2.  The Revenge of the Sith-An extremely close 2nd if not a tie with The Empire Strikes Back.3.  Attack of the Clones-a pretty distant 3rd, however, this film is extremely entertaining and all the romance is essential to the tale.4.  Return of the Jedi-A close 4th to Episode II.  The scene in which Luke confronts Vader is still my favorite scene in the entire saga.5.  A New Hope-Neck in neck with Attack of the Clones and Return of the Jedi.6.  The Phantom Menace-A distant 6th to all the other films, unfortunately.  To me Jar Jar and the Gungans are the sole reason this film ranks as the ""worst"" of the saga.  If only Lucas would have approached those characters a little differently, this film may well be ranked somewhere in the middle of the pack.  Darth Maul!!!!  The final saber duel may well be may 2nd favorite scene from the entire saga.Even if you don't agree with my rankings, if you are the least bit realistic, you will ultimately see the light.  Go pick this film up and have yourselves a ""Star Wars Saga Day"".  You'll then appreciate the entire saga for what it is, and understand why Revenge of the Sith is such a great movie."	5.0	One of the best films of the Star Wars saga.	2005-11-01	7	3	4

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3F4ARL8CAMSYR	"Rene Ritchie ""author, Legends of Wingchun"""	Star Wars (the original, then-un-episoded one... or four as it would be now...) was my first cinematic experience, the endless entrance of the Star Destroyer as it chased the rebel blocade runner over Tatooine my first larger-than-life experience.The first two prequels, technical accomplishments and brief moments of inspiration aside, never came close to living up to those memories, to the memories of Empire Strikes Back, and the half of Return of the Jedi that didn't involve Ewoks. Revenge of the Sith does. It comes close... ish.Here is the tale I, like many, many others who first read a short description of a fight and lava a long time ago in a source book far away, have been waiting for.Palpatine is, ironically, the shining light of this film, his performance subtle and over-the-top at the same time, as he pushes Anakin (who's suffered from weak, whiny portrayal the trilogy through) towards the precipice of the dark side.The abundance of Palpatine's henchmen (which perhaps could have been elminated and strengthened had he kept Maul alive and allowed him to evolve instead of peddling so quickly through Dooku and Grievous, and the throw-away Si/d/fo Dias) limited the drama, as did Mace Windu's strange choices, which seemed at times as though he was doing exactly what Palpatine needed to get where he wanted to go, but you really can't come to Lucas for story any more--just action.Amazing visual set pieces, which have become so common to the prequels as to often be taken for granted, are blown through the cinema roof this time around, from the massive battle between capital ships and fighters in the beginning to the climatic battle between Anakin and Obiwan that marks the movies end, and the debut of John Williams incredible Battle of Heroes anthem.The DVD contains a wealth of extras, many very entertaining and informative and while these were none of them the prequels I hoped for, Revenge of the Sith was ultimately better than I dreaded it would be.	3.0	The End of an Era	2006-02-01	5	4	1

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2A30JREVJN31Y	Retro	It seems to me that most people who watch Star Wars are cynical hypocrits who don't understand the concept of good storytelling.  Of course, I'm able to look at both trilogies subjectively, since I didn't get into the series until 1995, when Lucasfilm released the original trilogy to VHS for the last time.  The first time I saw them in a theater was when A New Hope was reissued in 1997, and they added the Jabba sequence.  I guess when you're old enough to remember what it was like to stand in line for three hours in 1977, witnessing crazed fans dressed as droids and Storm Troopers, it's a completely different experience.  So to a degree, I can understand what all the fuss is about.  People want to remember the films as simple movies about good vs. evil, Luke Skywalker duking it out with Darth Vader.  People have been waiting for the next three films ever since Lucas wrapped with Return of the Jedi.  He announced for years that the ideas he would introduce within the prequels would be farfetched, and far more bizarre, than anything ever seen in a Star Wars movie.  The sets and locations would be more sophisticated, characters would be more articulate, and the story more complex.  This was evident when you think about what a prequel is supposed to do.  People fled to theaters, slammed down eight bucks to see the Episode I trailer, and walked out without seeing the feature they paid for.  Then they get bent out of shape because the movie wasn't a life-changing experience.  If the prequels were so horrible, how can anyone explain why they're the top-grossing science fiction films of all time?  Because Padme wore skimpy clothes?  Because chicks dig Anakin's groovy little pig-tail?  They're good movies that get criticized for not appealing to 30-year-old war veterans who have Star Wars-themed weddings.  I don't care what generation you people grew up in, but Star Wars didn't change the face of a nation.  It just happened to come out when most other films were abysmally depressing, and enlightened a nation.  Now, every movie that comes out outdoes the last.  Nothing impresses anyone anymore.  Regardless of what Lucas claims, Phantom was not the first movie to utilize digital technology: it was only the first to go as far as it did, and Attack of the Clones built upon that.  The people who don't like the prequels forget that when Star Wars came out, you weren't popular for enjoying it.  You could like it, but you weren't cool.  It was never a movie designed for an overly mature audience.  The originals are just more story-driven because, let's face it, Lucas didn't have the tools to create anything more epic.  No one would see these movies if they depended on stop-motion and computer-controlled cameras today.  So they have to resort to the modern techniques of creating everything digitally, because that's what audiences buy into.  And sure, Jar-Jar is not a believable character, he doesn't need to be in Star Wars.  But Yoda is a sure leap.  These are just examples of how digital technology can be misused, and how advantageous it can be to the storyteller once you use it for the right purpose.Now, I gave the review three stars because obviously the movie isn't out yet.  I enjoy the existing movies all the same.  They each stand for something different in the story.  When The Phantom Menace came out, it surpassed all of my expectations, and the only thing that I asked was that it still look like a Star Wars movie.  I knew that Darth Vader wouldn't be a central character, because the movies have to let him get to that point.  While the story was more complex and more political than the previous films, it wasn't like that was all there was to it.  It did have a point.  If you have to ask what reason did the Podrace serve in the story, than you weren't paying attention, and Darth Vader wouldn't have become a cultural icon...he'd be dusting tables at a cantina somewhere, probably getting his arm lopped off by Ben Kenobi as a result of being turned into a punk-ass little kid because of Watto's harsh treatment.  When I walked out of that theater, the only things I didn't like was that a lot of it seemed like a Pixar animated film.  But I recall seeing Star Wars on the Disney channel years ago, on the roster with The Purple People Eater and The Neverending Story.  All these movies are just advanced Disney films with a plot that appeals to mostly everyone.Attack of the Clones was a slightly different story.  The four trailers they had out really hyped the movie for me, and I expected it to parallel the artistic nature of The Empire Strikes Back.  That was the first time I walked out of a Star Wars movie disappointed.  I liked the story better than Phantom, but at the same time, it was the first Star Wars movie to break out of character.  It had too much scope to it, and because Lucas was telling so much in the second chapter, it was condensed.  There were five planets, and a lot goes on before the movie jumps to a different location.  If anything, it was very episodic.  The climax, of course, was breathtaking, and the cliffhanger was troubling, especially the scene where Palpatine looks over the clone army, as the newly-built Star Destroyers are leaving for orbit.  It was a movie that I liked more and more over time, and even today, regardless of its shortcomings, stands out as a really good epic fantasy movie.  I almost cried when Anakin broke down after he killed the Tuskens.  It was a foreshadow of what he's capable of doing in Revenge of the Sith.  It's a truly chilling moment that I thought Hayden pulled off successfully.You have to be careful about what you read over the internet, because the plots that are out there (yes, even on supershadow.com), are rarely true to the actual movies.  What I read seemed plausible, but the tone didn't seem too different from that of Clones.  If it is at all accurate, there are several lightsaber fights: Anakin vs. Count Dooku, Obi-Wan vs. General Grievous, Anakin vs. Mace Windu, and of course, the end-all battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin that will have fans roaring.Truly, everyone criticizes the prequels for being heartless, but I don't think it's the fault of the filmmaker.  George Lucas has always been an experimental filmmaker, and never meant to make a worldwide success like Star Wars.  That's why I have problems sitting through THX 1138 and American Graffiti, both films that I can't identify with.  No, I think it's about what the audience takes from it.  Eventually, there will be six movies, and I think once people start looking at the complete six-movie epic, they will witness something even more spectacular.  It will be the culmination of nearly thirty years of hard work, but what Lucas created, regardless of generation, is a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience that I don't see being duplicated again.  The whole series is definitely worth analysing again and again, but aside from the flaws, which every movie has, it's a huge, sprawling story, covering just about every genre you can think of, told over six movies that made a hell of a lot of money.  And to answer my question from before, no, it wasn't because of Anakin's gimpy pig-tail.	3.0	Like the prequels or hate them, this is it.	2004-09-25	103	55	48

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A29YM3RGBSSBVT	Reuben Thaker	In this final installment of the prequel to his original trilogy, Lucas attempts to tie up his decade spanning spectacle and largely succeeds.  This films is part III, so leads to the original, Star Wars of 1977.As Lucas at some point made a decision to keep the series a children's fable, the series did not really grow with its audience (I and VI are aimed at the youngest audience).  Though more adjusted dollars were made by III than the original Star Wars, this is because more people see movies these days.  The current film milleau however, sees more films and more independent films gain widespread released.  The sophistication and expectation of filmgoers today, as well as diversity of taste, likely surpasses that of 1977.  Particularly as by 77 the downbeat early 70s films were giving way to escapism.So this begs the question, how important is this film?  I think the answer is not very.  Star Wars had a profound cultural impact on 70s youth culture.  III is just this year's summer blockbuster.  Though there is oblique commentary on the War in Iraq if one listens creatively, this is mostly irrelevant and it seems this series has little to offer this day and age but entertainment value.McDiarmid steals the show, as if this actor had been waiting 25 years to break out his cackling witch of an Evil Emperor.  This reinforces the Wizard of Oz themes behind the  trek of these archetypes in Star Wars.  Oz's music is even played in II.  There is also reference to Frankenstein, in a scene that is probably the highlight of the film.  Such baroque exposition as McDiarmid's is needed to stand up to Lucas's effects, and once again, most of this film is devoid of soul.  There is a half robot, half human General, who is killed when his shriveled delicate organs on some type of life support, are exposed.  This is an analogy to Lucas's films themselves, all metal and no heart.  McGregor seems tuned into Obi Wan, with a quiet reserve, faithful to the Jedi code of stifled emotion.  But the actor who plays young Vader, is again better suited to an episode of the OC.  At least there is no Jar Jar.The dvd 'print' of Episode III is excellent, and possibly is an exact digital image.  Reportedly, Episode II was released with full digital imprint, i.e. given the proper display equipment, what you see is the exact film broadcast in theatres, and is as detailed as the original film data.	4.0	pride of frankenstein	2005-11-17	3	0	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2WL02ENWFU9PM	Rex Macaroe	The film opens to the typical scrolling titles that setup the film. The camera pans down to reveal a massive battle that had been raging just offscreen. Two fighters travel through the conflict, destroying enemies as need be. No quick cuts, just one single long panning shot that sets up for the entire film.In an era when most sci-fi films strive for sensory overload, it's refreshing to see one with a clear idea of what it wants and the focus to pull it off. The latest installment of the classic series is every bit as good as its predecessors, despite some drawbacks. True, the operahouse is no cantina bar, and the acting isn't the greatest. Star Wars is not known for Oscar-worthy performances. The dialog, while memorable, has never been that great. This hits on most of the levels of the original trilogy while exploring completely new territory.Of course everyone was waiting to see how the birth of Darth Vader would play out. The two previous films seemed to set up a bratty kid who would betray those he loves in favor of placating his lust for power. Thank Lucas this isn't the case. Throughout most of the film, Anakin works toward becoming not only a better Jedi but a better man. A conflict occurs between his desire for righteousness and his obligation to protect Padme. Palpatine tempts him, and to my surprize, Skywalker reports the chancellor to the Jedi Council. Only when the thin line between Jedi and Sith is shattered does he betray himself to darkness.As he continues to carry out the chancellor's commands, killing more and more allies, he sinks deeper into darkness. The film portrays this with grace and ease, without condescension. It's smart enough to know the audience isn't dumb.Revenge of the Sith is not only a masterpiece of action. It is a superb psychological thriller driven by character and story as well as special effects. Its twists and turns surprize even though the entire world already knows the ending. Every bit as good as A New Hope or Return of the Jedi.	5.0	A great action epic: stunning and thought provoking	2005-08-18	8	4	4
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ALF49A9DLXQSO	RF	"Lucas plumbed the depths of bad filmmaking with Attack of the Clones. Revenge of the Sith is no better. Sure, the digital work is first rate but it boggles the mind how truly horrendous is everything else. You can write-off practically every scene where Hayden Christensen opens his mouth. Clumsy acting compounded by a script that belongs to one of those Serials where rocketships emit sparks and hang from all-too visible wires. The Star Wars physics are a joke. Jedi Knights, who can leap and bounce around like Roger Rabbit on crack when it's convenient, yet Anakan can't manage to jump high enough to avoid that fateful blow from Obiwans lightsaber. It's because Obiwan has the ""high ground"", you see. Lightsaber duel after lightsaber duel, with little new to show. We've seen it all before. It got to the point where I was wishing for an Indiana Jones moment. Couldn't someone just pull out a blaster and end it before it started? The transformation from good Anakan to evil Anakan was less than convincing and I laughed out loud when he proclaimed his desire to RULE THE GALAXY with Padme by his side. Who writes this stuff? The only good part was the very end - the credits were a welcome relief. The Star Wars films took a nosedive after The Empire Strikes Back and never looked back. Revenge of the Sith is, at best, equal to Attack of the Clones. Yahoo. Here's hoping that Lucas finally has enough money to never go near a camera again."	1.0	A showcase for digital animation but little else.	2005-11-14	30	19	11

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AXOS8IWBXNZGT	"Richard W Little ""I am a maple leaf on the wi..."	"Here are my thoughts on Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.A good alternate title would have been The Fall of the Jedi.These new prequel episodes have been much more of an integrated story than the original movies.  In Episode I, the place is set: a Republic which certainly is not a democracy (how do trading guilds have votes in the Galactic Senate?), leaders who place fashion at the same importance level as defending their people and homeland, and a group of superhuman policemen who place their own ascetic rules above embracing a fatherless, frightened child who might actually be their own salvation, by their own prophecies.  Society is technologically advanced, with lots and lots of robot labour, but slavery still flourishes, and the long arm of Republic law isn't quite long enough to act to protect their citizens.If this sounds a little like a society in decay to you, I would have to agree.  There's always a way back from this precipice, through dynamic leadership skills, but none of the key players are willing to step up and take the plunge...or perhaps they're not capable.  So, into the vacuum of leadership steps more morally...questionable people.  In this case, it's the Sith Lord, Darth Sideous, Senator/Chancellor/Emperor Palpatine.  In a stunning display of cunning and strategy, stretching over all three Episodes, Palpatine slowly increases his political power base, turns his opposition against each other, and employs the superhuman policemen (the Jedi) in a complete distraction, the Clone War.  Once in power as the Emperor, Palpatine turns and slides the Jedi off the board.I'm sure the Jedi felt righteous in fighting the Clone War.  They had an unambiguous goal--defend the Republic.  They didn't question whether they should fight, or whether they were fighting on the right side.  It was all very...emotionless.  A lack of emotion and emotional entanglement with anyone other than other Jedi, was the Jedi way.  Think of it this way: if Yoda had run for Chancellor, he could have had the job, and worked to end slavery, and prevented this whole mess.  If the Jedi weren't forbidden to marry, then Anakin could have married Padme openly, or the Jedi would have responded to his dream with something more helpful and emotional than the functional equivalent of ""death comes to us all"", and his self-fulfilling dream prophecy wouldn't have come to pass, and the Jedi wouldn't have fallen.  Years later, Yoda and Obiwan urge Luke to abandon his friends, so that he can complete his training and work towards some higher purpose.So, here, in Revenge of the Sith, Anakin turns to the only outsider who offers him emotional support, and some level of power to help save his wife.  It's just unfortunate that it's Palpatine who offers Anakin this help, and the help turns in his hands like a knife.  The Jedi could have helped the troubled lad (and he's been in very apparent difficulty for some time now), but instead they offered him only platitudes: ""Trust your feelings"", ""Be mindful of your thoughts"", etc.The Jedi clearly feel that real, emotional love is dangerous, so they avoid it at all costs.  They have thereby cut themselves off from the power and aid that such love brings.  As in ""Lord Mhoram's Victory"", the Jedi are only able to triumph, much later, when they finally avail themselves of this power, and embrace the danger that goes along with it.  But, it is not to be, in Episode III.Anakin does eventually fulfill the prophecy, and restores balance to the Force.  It's my thesis, that the Force is balanced by love, and is restored to the Jedi who embrace love, rather than those practiced in the Jedi arts who embrace only ascetic virtues, but not the greater world (the old school Jedi), or those who seek total power and domination (the Sith); those two, believing themselves to be polar opposites, are drawn to each other like moths to a flame.Yep, all you need is love.OK, enough philosphizing.Episode III is a much more tightly woven tale than the previous two Episodes.  Telling the tale of Anakin's fall from grace, it gives us a storyline that actually has some merit, and gives us a tangible reason for the Anakin-Padme storyline.  Jar-jar appears, briefly, but I don't think speaks.  Ian McDiarmid really carries the movie in a way that needed to happen, showing skill which I wasn't expecting to see.  Ewan McGregor is the quintessential Obiwan, a Jedi version of James Bond in many ways, and shows emotion in a way that most Jedi don't.  Hayden Christensen does reasonably well with the material he's got, and he's got a lot to live up to, so it must have been difficult going.  Natalie Portman's performance is still the weakest, being the most wooden.  Yoda kicks more ass than ever before.The movie's certainly violent enough to be PG-13.  Lots of Jedi die.  Folks are beheaded, their hands are lopped off, and they are cut down from behind.  Children die, on-screen and off.  Consider carefully before bringing young children to see this movie.If you sit back and relax and enjoy the movie, you should become emotionally involved with it.  That's the best sign, I think, that the movie's good.  So, enjoy!"	5.0	The Fall of the Jedi	2005-05-24	6	5	1

I grew up with Star Wars and loved the classic trilogy, while the prequels have been a mixed bag for me.  Whatever shortcomings the principal cast members from the original films may have had as actors, they more than made up for it in chemistry (which George Lucas has said was what he was really looking for all along).  The cast members of the prequel films have shown very little chemistry if any at all.  Acting-wise, Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid have carried the prequel trilogy, but even that was not enough to make us forget the wooden performances of some of their co-stars or some of the very bad dialogue written for these movies.  I think another problem was Lucas' insistence on writing and directing these films himself.  He should have entrusted the writing job to Lawrence Kasdan who did a great job writing Episodes V & VI (especially with TESB), and bring in another director.  I mentioned that McGregor & McDiarmid have carried the prequels, and Episode III is where both men really get to shine, putting in the finest performances seen in this trilogy.  Also, the action and violence are just enough to make up for the lack of chemistry between actors in this film.  Many loose ends are tied up, but other questions are raised--such as why the first Death Star took nearly twenty years to build while the second one, which is about twice the size and twice as powerful as its predecessor, took only five or six years to build?  Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is a good film with spectacular action sequences, but it is not a great film.  It does however, wrap up on a high note a rather disappointing prequel trilogy which could have and should have been so much better.	4.0	Spectacular end to an otherwise lackluster prequel trilogy.	2005-06-16	8	4	4

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ	Robert Blake	"Sure ""Revenge Of The Sith"" has some cheesy acting, bad love scenes and quick resolutions, but then again, isn't that how all space opera goes? George Lucas is no Oliver Stone, Martin Scorsese, Tarantino or even Spielberg, but that's not the point, the reason why ""Star Wars"" remains one of the great movie series of all time is because it has a heart, something lacking in most modern films. Let's be honest, the first film from 1977 doesn't have Oscar-worthy performances, but it was still nominated for Best Picture and established a modern mythology that has embedded itself into the worldwide culture. ""Revenge Of The Sith"" is the one film from the prequel trilogy that stays true to this legacy, 1999's ""The Phantom Menace"" and 2002's ""Attack Of The Clones"" were good, yet flawed movies that both lacked the essential SPIRIT of ""Star Wars,"" ""Revenge Of The Sith"" feels like ""ah yes, and now the good stuff!"" Here we really do get the complete tale of the fall of Anakin Skywalker and the rise of Darth Vader and the evil Empire, the birth of Luke and Leia and how everything fell apart and led to where we started in ""A New Hope."" In a funny way this was the movie that deserved all the hype first splashed on ""Episode 1"" which disappointed many and resulted in the annoying creation of Jar Jar Binks. ""Revenge Of The Sith"" pulses with amazing vistas, exciting action sequences and a sweet love story that falls into classic, almost Greek tragedy. Lucas doesn't chicken out and goes for complete darkness, granting this movie the series' first ever PG-13 rating. John Williams' music is epic and grand, providing the rich sonic landscape for a story of loss and horror, when friends and pit against friends and an intergalactic holocaust takes place. Anakin is no longer the sweet little boy from ""The Phantom Menace,"" instead he's an angry, doomed man destined to become a mechanical Hitler in search of redemption for his crimes. ""Revenge Of The Sith"" has been called a veiled reference to the Bush administration, this is ridiculous, if anything this is the kind of scenario that took place in Iran when the Ayatollah took power. ""Revenge Of The Sith"" is fun, exciting, tragic and always visually stunning. A fitting finale to a great story and a fitting beginning for a story we already know all too well."	4.0	A Grand, Fitting Finale.	2006-05-09	4	1	3

Powerful, mysterious and awesome.  The new trilogy of films, especially episode 3 changed that forever.Granted, George Lucas intended to use episodes 1-2-3 to answer a lot of questions about Vader's origins, maybe even change our view of him, but I don't think he intended that fans leave with the change I experienced.  I don't see Anakin as a tragic, tortured soul, torn between his desire to do good and his need to save his lady love.  In fact I see no regret in Christainsen's performance as Anakin sinks into the darkness.  Hey, George - the emperor is asking the kid to murder children as the price for saving Padme - but do we see any reluctance or hesitation in Hayden's performance?  I sure don't.  He doesn't seem to have any feeling of horror at what his new master is asking him to do, or any other emotions that might be appropriate to the situation.  His acting ranges from ""spoiled brat"" to ""arrogant fool"" and that's about the extent of it.  There have been dozens of versions of the Faust story, but this is the second one I know of that the Faust character doesn't care about the loss.  The first?  Bart Simpson.  Yes, George, I am comparing Anakin Skywalker's emotional journey in Episode 3 with that of cartoon character Bart Simpson!So here I am adding my review to thousands of others and probably no one will ever read this, never mind Lucas Himself.  But for what it's worth, thanks George for ruining the ultimate movie villian for me.  Now when I see Darth Vader in the original three movies, I think of him only as a teenage jerk who sold his soul to the devil WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF HESITATION OR REGRET."	2.0	Forever ruins my feeling about Darth Vader	2005-11-02	16	9	7

First off, you people just can not accept a new world of Star Wars. Everyone wanting Episode One to be Anakin discovered at an older age, be a great pilot (no podracing), and in Episode 2 everyone wanted Anakin to become Vader, and in Three they wanted the Purge of the Jedi, and how Obi Wan escpaes, etc.. Well thats not what happened. And Many fans must realize that your all ignorant. Its like when People went to go see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Everyone had their mind on the orginal and many hated this new version. Get the sequels out of your head and have an opened mind.Yes Revenge of the Sith had minor flaws, but it is deffinently something new and better than what we have received.Spoilers May Appear!-----First off, Revenge of the Sith has its strong points--Anakin becomes Vader-The Jedi Purge Begins-Palpatine becomes Emperor-The Emperor duels Yoda-The Clone Wars come to an end-The Rebellion starts to formEverything we wanted was in 2 horus and 10 minutes. Now thats what I have to complain about. If Revenge of the Sith was just slightly much longer, like the longest of them all, it would be just as perfect as Empire Strikes Back.Lucas's scenery is beautiful, and the Emperor's performance is astonishing.I loved the entire final duel. I never felt my hair stand up like that when I saw Obi Wan vs. Anakin, as Yoda vs. Sidious, since The final Duel in Return of the Jedi. I liked the idea of having several endings, it completed everything and truly feels Star Wars is complete.There's just a few minor things I wish I have seen:-More of the Death Star being built-More scenes as the Jedi Temple is attacked-A little more dialogue scenes-The Explanation of the Chosen One-Palpatine's background of being a Sith- And seeing Qui Gon's spirit which would have been nice. oh well.So This is my view of how the Star Wars films fall into-From Best to Not So Good :-)1. A New Hope2. The Empire Strikes Back3. Return of the Jedi, Revenge of the Sith &lt; Its a Tie4. The Phantom Menace5.

After two lackluster prequels, Lucas finishes the series off with a bang with a film bursting at the seams with special effects. The movie has minor problems, such as the actual dialogue and acting, but these are minor because people go to see Star Wars for the effects, and not the dialogue.Hayden Christensen returns as Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight filled with fear and frustration. Anakin can't understand why he isn't as powerful as he should be. This, coupled with his recurrent dreams of his wife Padme (played by Natalie Portman) dying, ultimately leads Anakin to his fate. Ewan McGregor gives the film's best performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin's mentor who is concerned about his lust for power. Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has the same effect on Anakin as Obi-Wan, but turning him to the dark side.Watching Anakin turn evil was truly a cinematic event, the viewer's heart breaking along with his as he commits deed after deed, becoming fully seduced by the dark side. Hayden Christensen gives a lackluster performance, at least until Anakin goes evil, where Christensen seems to shine. Natalie Portman is pretty bad too, but not as bad as the painful dialogue. When Anakin and Padme discuss their love, my stomach was churning. Especially at the part when Anakin says to his love, ""You look so beautiful"". Padme responds with ""That's because I'm so in love"". It isn't that bad until Anakin comes back with ""No, it's because I'm so in love with you"".But all that aside, let's get to the effects. From the opening space battle to the final duel, this movie is laced with them. And might I add, the Anakin vs. Obi-Wan lightsaber duel is one of the best fight sequences I have ever seen. And that's not a spoiler, becuase they tell you about it in the preview. But seriously, it is excellent. The switching of settings, accompanied by Obi-Wan talking to him after, makes for an excellent fight. And, once again, McGregor really shines in this fight.So, if you are debating whether or not to see Episode Three, I say see it. It provides an excellent ending to an excellent legacy. The critics who love acting and dialogue might complain, but thats not what we go to Star Wars for. It has an emotional impact as great as the original trilogy, while tying everything together nicely. 4 stars out of 5."	4.0	An Excellent Ending	2006-04-14	6	4	2

If you are interested in seeing the transformation Anakin makes into Darth Vader then fine, watch this movie out of curiosity. But beeing such a poor actor playing such a one-dimentional character, who could really care.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1GTA8YYXULNQU	Rod D. Martin	"(...)THE JEDI BLEW ITHow Yoda Threw Away the Republic, and What Americans Should LearnbyRod D. Martin, 10 June 2005In some circles, particularly young male ones, calling someone ""Yoda"" has come to mean something of a cross between Solomon and Batman:  not merely wise beyond all reason, but powerful and cool as well.  This was, of course, based on the original Star Wars trilogy, which depicted the diminutive green Muppet discipling Luke Skywalker in the ways of the Force, and ultimately bringing down the evil Galactic Empire.Ah, things were so simple then.  But now George Lucas has told the rest of the story (and judging by the box office take, you have almost certainly seen at least Revenge of the Sith).  And Yoda, though still ""the best and the brightest"", remains as brilliant and well-intentioned as the subjects of Halberstam's classic.But he is also just as flawed.Sure, Senator-cum-Chancellor-cum-Emperor Palpatine is still the villain, and a truly evil one of a sort best compared to Stalin and Hitler.  But it is the Jedi who throw away the Old Republic.  Not willfully, of course, but by a thousand small sins:  attitudes here, assumptions there, and a blithe, unbecoming arrogance throughout.  In another age these would not have hurt so much:  indeed we learn that the Jedi have not rethought their methods in almost a thousand years.  But pressed by a diligent, masterful foe, these same small faults betray them, and the Republic folds like a house of cards.So it might prove with our Republic, or any republic.As in the Garden or any Greek play, pride is their principal tragic flaw; but it is at least a failing the Jedi come by honestly. The Jedi are entrusted with guarding the galaxy's liberties, and hence the Republic itself, and they've done this extremely well for a very long time.  It is no more wrong for them to walk tall and call the shots than it is for modern America; and yet in the manner of all flesh, over time, they badly lose their way.When, in Episode II, Obi Wan Kenobi cannot find a key piece of data in the Jedi archives, the school-marmish librarian tells him that ""if it is not in our archives, it does not exist.""  It does, of course, as even Yoda's ""younglings"" figure out; yet this sort of self-satisfied superiority permeates the Jedi temple, from the initial grave mistake of allowing a barely-minted Jedi to train ""the chosen one"" to the mind-numbingly stupid decision to send the obviously hormonal Anakin to ""guard"" the stunning young Queen by himself.  In all these things and more, the Jedi are oblivious to obvious consequences because they are so certain of their own ""wisdom"".This arrogance is matched by the ascetic, even Gnostic philosophy of the Jedi.  Young Anakin is taught to purge himself of most emotion and all attachments:  failure to do so is ""the path to the Dark Side.""  And indeed, much of what the Jedi oppose -- fear, anger, hate and so on -- can be very dark indeed.  But the potential need not be the reality.  As Martin Luther said, ""Do not suppose that abuses are eliminated by destroying the object which is abused.  Men can go wrong with wine and women:  shall we then prohibit and abolish women?""  This point is completely lost on Yoda.The Jedi also fail to see that passions and attachments are strengths when under control.  Jesus was angry when He overturned the moneychangers' tables.  But while Qui-Gon fell to Darth Maul despite his meditation, Obi Wan defeated him in angered reaction, Mace Windu defeated the Emperor in his own controlled rage, and ultimately, Luke's anger at the threat to his sister (another obviously healthy attachment) makes possible the defeat of Darth Vader and the destruction of the Empire.The Jedi asceticism proves inhumane as well.  Viewers scratched their heads when young Anakin's mother was left as a slave on Tatooine in Episode I; by Episode III they were aghast at Yoda's cold-blooded counsel to a torn and devastated Anakin, facing visions of an agonizing Padme dying in childbirth, that he should just put that attachment out of his mind.This alone might make Anakin's Faustian bargain with Palpatine inevitable.But ultimately (listen closely, John McCain), the real disaster lies in the Jedi's attitude toward the Republic itself. The Jedi are ""above"" politics, although not really outside it, being possessed of lifelong terms and little if any review by outside authority.  They believe in the Republic as an abstraction, and they certainly stand for its ideals.Yet they loath its workings.  Obi Wan tediously and tenaciously lectures Anakin on the baseness and cravenness of the political process.  But while this may annoy Anakin, it does sink in.  In discussing with Padme the Senate's gridlock, the future Darth Vader intones that what is needed is someone ""wise and strong"" to ""make them"" act.  When Padme points out that Anakin is proposing a dictatorship, Anakin makes clear he believes the ends would justify the means.  And upon converting to the Dark Side, he justifies his course in terms of loyalty to justice and to the Republic itself.There is no question that politicians are frequently venal, but to teach disdain for freedom's institutions and processes is foolhardy in the extreme.  The nature of democracy is that no one gets all of their way:  compromises must be made, deals must be cut, because no one person or group has a monopoly on power.  The people elected to do this are not evil:  they are representatives of the much greater group of people who elected them.  And they daily do proper battle with the representatives of other free people with different interests, different needs, and different points of view.This is not just healthy, it is the only way there can be liberty.  Churchill wasn't kidding when he said that ""democracy is the worst form of government, except all the others.""  Another generation of Americans understood this and looked up to statesmen, encouraging their children to grow up to be President.  And to the degree we label every campaign contribution as a bribe, every politically active citizen as a ""special interest"" and every politician corrupt, we set up the day when a Palpatine and a Vader of our own ""protect"" us from ourselves, to the cheers of a thankful nation of slaves.Others have done this before us, most notably Germany in 1933.  Our institutions are stronger, older, better.  But arrogance, a lack of love for our fellowman, and a studied ingratitude and contempt for the institutions which define us can sap it yet.

I really enjoyed it and its the best of the pre-trilogy and i like it better than the OT movies. I was too young to enjoy the OT when it came out but when i look at it now, i do find some parts dumb or boring(in the OT).here are my gripes. grevious should have had more fight scenes that he wins so we can respect him. dooku shouldnt have been killed that fast. finally, keep all the deleted scenes, they were good.i liked the making of documentary on disc2 very ineteresting.overall not a perfect movie but only because it wasnt 3 hours :)EDIT: after a few years since release i think the OT was better than the prequels. i was caught up in the hype when this came out hehe.	4.0	make an uncut version	2005-11-01	3	0	3

In my opinion, Lucas has done a fine job with the first 2 episodes after the original trilogy.  Episode III will be loved simply because it is the return of the most feared and original villain ever put on a movie screen.  Also many fans will enjoy Palpatine's change into the sith lord.  For me i am very excited to see the transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader.  Not exactly the suit, but the point at which he makes his final turn to the dark side.  Episode III should provide us with many memories and should be a fine conclusion to the best movie series the motion picture industry has ever known."	5.0	This Is It Folks	2005-04-06	20	8	12

Get real. I admit it's pretty easy to get caught up in the moment when being dazzled by Episode III's eye candy, but when I got home and watched Episode IV on DVD, it was obvious which movie was still the horse to bet on. Revenge of the Sith without a doubt should be commended for arguably setting a new standard in big-budget flicks (I say ""arguably"" because Peter Jackson might have something to say about that), but, along with Episodes I & II, ultimately doesn't have the spunkiness of the original trilogy.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"****1/2With ""Star Wars: Episode III - The Revenge of the Sith,"" we finally end up back where we started 28 long years ago with the original groundbreaking film.  In this final piece of the puzzle, we learn what it is that causes Anakin Skywalker to finally give up his Jedi knighthood, cross over to the Dark Side, and become the dreaded Darth Vader.""The Revenge of the Sith"" is more consistent in tone and feels more of a piece than the previous two installments, though, I must confess, that those earlier works - especially ""Attack of the Clones"" - have grown some in stature on subsequent viewings.  What makes ""Sith"" an effective film is that it has a real human drama at its core, as an individual of great potential undergoes a tormenting inner struggle between light and dark, love and hate, good and evil.  And even though we know which of those choices he will end up making, we are still fascinated to finally see how exactly it comes about.  For the most part, Lucas paints Anakin's conversion in believable, telling strokes, and we are surprised to discover that it is prompted more by fear and love than by greed and hunger for power.  And if the dialogue isn't always up to snuff, well, one doesn't necessarily expect Shakespearean language in a work designed for mass media consumption - even if that work deals in such grand Shakespearean themes as pride and honor, courage and envy, jealousy and betrayal.Although Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) have been granted ample screen time in this episode, it seems a shame that Padme (Natalie Portman) has gone from being an elected queen in ""Phantom Menace"" to a senator in ""Attack of the Clones"" to little more than a simpering housewife in this installment.  It sure doesn't do much to enhance Lucas' reputation as a 21st Century feminist.  Oh well, at least Jar Jar Binks has been reduced to little more than a silent walk-on part.  That's some compensation at least.On the technical level of computer-generated backgrounds and special effects, the work here is on a scale and of a quality never before seen in any motion picture.  Indeed, it is safe to say that every single shot in this film is a visual masterpiece, an extraordinary evocation of a world that could only exist in the mind of a creative genius like Mr. Lucas.  He has achieved wonders here far beyond anything we thought even he was capable of doing.  For that alone, the film will earn its niche in movie history.But even more impressive is the fact that, with ""Sith,"" Lucas has accomplished something no filmmaker ever has before.  He has brought his audience full circle, completing an epic adventure at the place where it originally started.  The sense of satisfaction is immense at the end, as we see the seeds being sown for the adventure we know lies just down the road a bit, with characters whom we came to love three decades ago.  He almost single-handedly proves that media res works can have their own poignancy and power.Our hats are off not only to Lucas and his army of master craftsmen who have brought this monumental effort to completion, but to the audience who never wavered in their faith and who had the fortitude and patience to stick it out with him even when the prospects didn`t always appear so encouraging.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A20RRFP8NLX85Z	"Role Pole ""Da BOB"""	Well I saw the movie in the theaters in May 23, I thought the dialouge was corny at first, George Lucas again directs the actors to act out his own vision. After a few viewings it becomes like fine wine. That's Ok. I've read though where lots of it, was cut down for time. Lots of good dialouge any. Yes the movie has outstanding effects and battle scenes. Opening scene is pure classic, but the direction and the acting is questionable. Particularly for the main actors Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christension, George(STAR WARS) Lucas in my opinion is one of the greatest storytellers ever to live, but on this film he does a great disservice to their acting abilities. Along with Natalie Portman, her acting skills seem alittle less than predominate in this flick than the other two. When I see the corny dialouge in the third installment, it makes me want to put EPs 1,2,4,5,6 instead. Lucas has great ideas and everything, what he should have done was hire a director like Irvin Kershner, someone who is familiar with Star Wars and let the principle actors act to their capabilities and with more focus, instead of relying too much on LORD VADER transformations and PALPI and the visual aspects of the film.  Hey I Love Star Wars and George Lucas. Maybe someday when Lucus tinkers with EP3 he can revamp the dialouge to make SITH a better movie than it is. Deleted scenes were awesome its worth the price of this two disk set. Go ahead and buy this film. Don't let me and the other negative reviewers hold you back from Star Wars. I still love it though.

Mr. McGregor, of course, is also admirable as his role as Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

I personally am more of a fan of the original trilogy than what I have been of the prequels. Although I did enjoy TPM, and AOTC, they definitely were not as well done as A New Hope or Empire. I think the general criticisms of the first two prequels was lack of good story, poor acting. First I would like to say that the acting is better in Revenge of the Sith than the first two prequels, but what truly stood out in this movie was the story. It delivered perfectly, for the first time since Empire, Lucas connected the audience.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ADKA2MJQQCMTO	Ron Sullivan	"I'm going to try and keep this review fairly short.  I wanted to try and take a new angle on the film by pointing out its improvements over the horribly disappointing 'Attack of the Clones.'(AOTC) 1. I felt that George Lucas needs to hire someone to redraft his script in THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY. Although Lucas's imagination is second to none (in my opinion) and he can come up with a very creative story, he just simply, try as he might, CANNOT write dialogue. It's CLEARLY his worst Achilles Heel.  It seems like everyone comes off almost tripping over his or her lines, none of it sounds natural and none of it flows.(Revenge of the Sith) It's rumored that Lucas did indeed have a ghostwriter fine-tune his work.  It still had some rough spots, but it's a VAST improvement over AOTC.(AOTC) 2. I think that Lucas has become WAY too obsessed with visual effects. That said, his ILM team is STAGGERINGLY good at it, but I almost get the feeling that Lucas is trying too hard to fit the script into the story-board instead of taking his story-board from the script. There has to be a balance and I think its lop-sided here.(ROTS) Not only did he find that balance, but the special effects are jaw-dropping!  The opening battle over Coursant was a visual masterpiece.  This film was, very obviously, the one Lucas really wanted to tell.(AOTC) 3. Hayden Christensen looks like a reject from Dawson's Creek and, frankly, doesn't seem to be a very good actor.(ROTS) I was wrong.  I don't know what else to say, the boy's clearly showing some ability.  The funny thing is it wasn't even this film that got my attention.  Go and watch Christensen in 'Shattered Glass.'  He's outstanding!  In Sith, he's clearly matured and has totally relaxed into the role.  You can see that he's having fun with it now and isn't coming across as being uneasy and unsure of himself the way he seemed to in 'Clones.'(AOTC) 4. Speaking of which, Lucas is under-using Natalie Portman to the point of it being criminal. She is an OUTSTANDING young actress, and yet the only close-ups she seems to earn are pleas for help in some way or another. I'm frustrated that we know VERY little about this young woman that Darth Vader had fallen for when there seems to be a ton of her back-story that's RIGHT THERE to be explored.(ROTS) Actually Lucas is still guilty.  Portman really got shafted in this series.  I get the feeling a lot of her scenes wound up in the cutting room ...(AOTC) 5. I also kind of get the impression Lucas is trying really hard to make these movies too kid-friendly. Not that I'm looking for flat out violence or gore, but there were a couple instances where I thought they might really be able to explore Anakin's moving to the dark-side and didn't take advantage of it. He seems to be forgetting that the audience knows that Anakin eventually winds up eventually decimating the Jedi order. It's a lot less important that we ""like"" him as it is we understand what he is going through.(ROTS) I'm laughing about this one now.  Lets just leave it stand by saying that ""he's got it covered.""Outstanding movie!  It's my second favorite in the series behind 'Empire' and without question, light-years better then the other two prequels.  This receives my highest recommendation!"	4.0	Absolutely Loved It ...	2005-08-25	15	10	5
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1TK6R2JSC97HL	Rottenberg's rotten book review	"A mixed bag.  To make it short, there's a lot to enjoy here, but also a lot to make you scratch your head.  Poor scripting and editing, and a screenplay which just ties up loose ends rather than make them compelling, stunt this ultimate entry into ""Star Wars"" canon.""Revenge"" (not ""return"") picks up a short time after ""Clones"".  The clone-war against the separatists hasn't been going on that long, but many members of the intergalactic senate are slowly growing tired of the conflict - and especially the emergency powers given their Supreme Chancellor to fight the war.  The film begins, however, with Chancellor Palpatine having been kidnapped by a daring (and evil) separatist leader named General Grievous.  In a boffo-opening sequence, Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker fight through waves of the enemy to board Grievous's ship and save the Chancellor.  Yet even after that battle, the war continues - forcing the Jedi to venture farther from the capitol city-planet of Coruscant.  In successive battles, the Jedi lead clone armies against the separatists, even as they harbor doubts about the cause for which they are fighting.  Back at ""home"", Anakin and Padme keep their marriage a secret, even as her pregnancy and his own premonitions of doom will make that impossible.  Blinded, Skywalker is, by the ""Dark Side"" - and specifically by the cheerful lure of the Sith left by the more overtly ominous Chancellor.This was a huge movie - easily outdoing ""Attack"" and ""Menace"".  Most of the time, the story is content to fill-in the blanks of ""Star Wars"" canon as quickly and unimaginatively as possible (the turn of Skywalker to the Sith; the betrayal of the Jedi; the rise of the Empire and the denouement of Palpatine).  There are some bits when the story nearly escapes being stuck within SW history (you get the idea that Anakin just might resist the dark side) that do save the flick.  The battle sequences are incredible (although some of them are so huge and fast, you may need to be a Jedi master just to follow them), and the story is definitely satisfying enough for SW fans who thought they faced the end of the line back in '83 with ""That Ewok movie"".  Lastly ""Revenge"" excels over the last two movies in rising above the cardboard thinness of the major characters.  There's no ""Han Solo"" character here, but ""Revenge"" can do better without one.  The flick is dark, though only noticeably so in a few scenes.  I caught this with my 8 year old, and she had a rousing time."	4.0	And now the circle is complete....or is it?	2005-06-27	3	0	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2B6EBLE32P6VR	"R. Pichlik ""EWTN fan"""	"As a visual feast for the eyes this saga has been excellent.  It has had spectacular special effects and exciting and epic battles.  HOWEVER, the problem that this saga has experienced is when people have tried to compare it and contrast it with other classic sagas of ""good vs. evil""; this comparison has and will continue to fail.The classic stories have very clearly defined the lines of good and evil.  Further, they have always had their protagonists have a clearly defined ""code"" of right and wrong, good and evil, etc.  Here is where STAR WARS fails, and frankly has far more in common with the present.  In ""Return of the Jedi"" Luke chastises Obi-Wan for having lied to him about the real identity of his father and his father's fate.  The response he receives from Obi-Wan is that truth is relative and depends on your own point-of-view.  This theme is brought to its' culmination in ""Revenge of the Sith""; Obi-Wan chastises Anakin/Vader for holiding to ""absolutes"", (only a Sith deals in absolutes).This is very disturbing.  This suggests that truth, good, evil are all morally relativistic.  As a result they are fluid and never constant.  This, rather than being a depiction of life in a galaxy far, far away and a long time ago, is a far more accurate view of our own time.  This is the unfortunate part of the STAR WARS saga; the Republic and Jedi hold to no absolute truths; no eternal concepts of good and evil.  The world they reside in was doomed to failure for the very reasons that they failed to adhere to the absolutes that they so feared in the Sith; that was the one thing that they should have exceeded the Sith in."	3.0	Sci-Fi Moral Relativism	2005-08-10	0	0	0

Redundant FBI and Interpol warnings, movie ratings, intro menu movies, segue menu movies, THX ads and more make this a classic example of what is wrong with DVDs. No wonder people rip the content out--who needs all that junk?

What to expect from this DVD? The same things from the previous ones is the answer: Very well made interactive menus, a hidden eastern egg with the code 1138 (which by the way is awfully disappointing), and a bonus disc with deleted scenes and documentaries on how the film was made.The movieAnakin's path to the dark side is completed in this film; here we are to finally discover the reason that made him choose to follow Palpatine and not the Jedi. We get to see the destruction of the Jedi, the exile of Obi-Wan and Yoda, the birth of the twins and the creation of the Galactic Empire. Yes, once you see episode III you will not see Darth Vader the same again as now we'll be aware of the things that led him to make that choice, but even though we are talking about a 140 minutes movie, Lucas tries to solve the major points of the film in the last 20-30 minutes, leading to a couple of disastrous and involuntary comical situations.Among the issues closed this way we may have Yoda's abrupt decision to go into exile after his battle with Palpatine (a 900 year old quitter?), Padme's death (which basically is due to her losing of the will to live... audience laughs), the decision of where to hide the twins (is really Anakin's home planet the best choice to hide the boy?) and of course Obi-Wan taking the lightsaber from his dying opponent to later say to his son ""Your father wanted you to have this"".I agree with those who say this one is the best of the new three episodes, a fact that wasn't too unexpected or difficult to achieve. Besides the history points that this film tries to connect with the old trilogy it is also worth to mention the visual facts. In the last part of the film we get to see the classical Tantive IV, we get to see some more cameos of the Corellian ships, the clothing of the crew at Tantive IV and the imperial officers and some others that try to help make the transition smoother. There is however the fact that the special effects from 1977 are no match for the ones seen in these new episodes, it is indeed a difficult match even when we have the special edition released last year on DVD, so it is up to you now to decide in which order are you going to present the saga to the new generations.The extrasDeleted scenes did really hurt me this time, there are 3 sequences related to the birth of the rebellion in which Padme, Bail Organa and Mon Mothma plan on presenting a petition to Palpatine, Lucas sacrificed these scenes as he thought the movie was more about Anakin than the rebellion. There is also a scene cut from the end sequence in which we get to see Yoda arriving to Dagobah, I would really like to have seen this in the theatrical release for the mere sentimentalism.The documentary ""Within a minute' takes you to see the hole process behind a 60 second sequence (even though it is indeed interesting, it doesn't show anything we hadn't seen in previous documentaries from the two previous episodes)It also contains the trailers, printed campaign, web documentaries and the trailers for the 2 new Star Wars videogames (a demo for Battlefront II is also included here)So let us all consider this as the definitive version of the Star Wars saga for the time being. Let us not forget that more versions and editions are coming next year to commemorate the 30th anniversary, and we all know Lucas likes to do changes when he has the opportunity. At least episodes 2 and 3 were not altered for their DVD release as episodes 1, 4, 5 and 6 were."	4.0	Does it really connect the dots...?	2005-12-05	3	2	1

Thrace	"I've been a fan of Star Wars since I first saw the original trilogy as Sunday afternoon movies.While I loved Episodes I and II,they weren't without flaws(Jar Jar Binks,talking to you am I) and/or weakness (Romantic Dialogue,found wanting are you)and didn't really live up to expectations if you ask me.Not so for ""Revenge of the Sith"".This movie is so different than any of the other star wars films. This one's dark and intense. And even though you know the outcome, you can hardly wait to finally see how it all went down.This movie is pay-off for all the patient fans who sat through Eps I and II.I loved how Anakin's descent into the dark side was so carefully followed through. He didn't just wake up one day and turn evil. On the contrary, Lucas has been planting seeds for Anakin's turn to the dark side since ""The Phantom Menace"" and it all comes together in ""Revenge of the Sith"".I also loved the viscious cycle that Anakin was trapped in in this film. He was powerful and volatile, and that made the Jedi council uneasy causing them to distrust him and hold him back thus causing him to become more angry and more powerful and volatile, and well, we all know this isn't going to end well.The special effects were incredible, the score amazing, the light saber battles were awesome, and the inevitable ending is always there, right under the surface, waiting.I was pleasantly surprised at how Hayden Christiansen really kicked into high gear on this one. No more with the angsty teenage boy, just a very dangerous man.Overall, I think this film is meant to be the climax of the entire star wars series and it does an admirable job of it.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1JUYF5D6TFFHB	"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya"""	"When Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith premiered last May, it was a megablockbuster at the Box Office, drawing not only the hardcore, newer fans of Star Wars (1999-2005) but the old 1977-1983 original Trilogy: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. These old and new generations of fans came together to watch the Star Wars Swan Song. This may be the final film in the entire series, since I doubt more ""episodes"" are in the making, since enough is enough. It is a fitting farewell film, complete with a kind of magic and dignity of its own. While I must concede to the claims by some reviewers that George Lucas has lost his old magic touch in telling a good story (sacrificed as it would appear for the sake of sensational computer graphics and cinematography)- this is nevertheless a superb film, a memento, a relic for fans of the saga, and consummation, since this is the end-all of the series. Many people, myself included, saw this film for ""closure"" to see how Anakin Skywalker makes the transition from good to evil, culminating in the scene in which he is given the Darth Vader persona.The look of this film is certainly impressive, perhaps the finest cinematically of all the films. The music is also very well-executed, and it is John William's last endeavor with Lucas on the Star Wars films. The build-up to the finale is riveting. The whole film has tension and a sense of tragedy prevails the final hour. Anakin Skywalker finally succumbs to the Dark Side, influenced by the dark philosophy of the ambitious and corrupt Senator Palpatine,who is in reality the elusive and mysterious Sith Lord Darth Sidious. As the vile Senator rises to power in a calculated move (he manipulated the truth in news and had made up a phony war to distract the Jedi) the Jedi continue to battle their enemies, among them the power-hungry half-Droid, half-alien General Grievous. Obi-Won (played by Ewan Mcgreggor) matures into a closer look-alike to Alec Guiness' classic portrayal, even imitating the accent and verbage. Yoda fights the Senator, now self-proclaimed Emperor of the Galactic Empire, in a thrilling light saber duel, which parallels the more significant duel between Obi Won and the Dark Apprentice of the Emperor, Anakin Skywalker. The transformation to Darth Vader is rather sudden, and lacks a gravitas and kind of slowness it deserves, but it seems to me Lucas was not intending to make this scene a climatic scene. It is the tragic extermination of the Jedi (except for Obi-Won and Yoda) that is gravely emphasized, complete with serious, melancholy and tragic music, similar to music of Richard Wagner, Jean Sibelius or Samuel Barber. Padme Amidala (played by Natalie Portman) lacks the strength and Princess-Leia style heroics she had in the previous two films (Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones)and is instead a vapid, love-sick, heartbroken and weak victim of destiny. Her lines are rather flat and lack depth, except for her dying words as she gives birth to Luke and Leia ""I know there is still good in him (referring to Anakin/Vader)"". However, she looks beautiful as a kind of Greek Earth-Mother figure or in the Funeral Scene as a Romantic Raphaelite heroine). Even if she fails to impress ultimately and cops out, the courtly but tragic relationship between Padme and Anakin is really quite moving. I did however find that Darth Vader (and yes it was once again the voice of James Earl Jones) was overly melodramatic when the Emperor lies saying that he had, in his rage, killed Padme. His shout ""No!"" is straight out of a scene in a Star Wars comic book. But despite the flaws that may be present in this film, this is an outstanding and excellent movie. George Lucas has not indeed lost his touch, it may well be that we have lost our innocence of the idea behind Star Wars- which is, despite its mix of spirituality and science fiction advenute elements, a basic story of good and evil, and in the case of Anakin Skywalker, the tragedy of a potentially great man turned evil, though ultimately redeemed by his son. It's a sci-fi family saga, really, not unlike Westerns, Japanese epics or Joseph Campbell's philosophical take on world mythology."	5.0	A Final Farewell To The Star Wars Saga	2005-09-22	8	3	5

""Revenge of the Sith"" is a spectacular return to form for the franchise. Allowing for the fact that all Star Wars fans knew where the film was heading with the birth of Darth Vader the build up and payoff were well worth it. Darth Vader rising will go on to become one of the most mememorable big screen moments of all time.The film did not lack for action either. Lightsabres galore are on display with multiple battles to keep the adrenaline flowing and although General Grevious with his coughing and spluttering health issues does not hold the same menace as Darth Maul and of course Vader, he has an interesting visual and the multiple spinning sabres are terrific.The movie tie up all the loose ends that lead into Star Wars and nothing is left out the pity is that Lucas has seemingly scrapped plans to make episodes seven to nine which were touted at one point."	5.0	A return to form from the Master Jedi	2005-11-05	0	0	0

I can't say that I was disappointed at all. I had very low expectations and it turns out that I really enjoyed the movie and my low expections were unfounded. Of course the acting was horrible but that has been a given in any starwars movie. Acting in sci-fi films is almost an accidental occurance. I thought that Anakin's transition to the darkside of the force was well done. Though it seemed a bit childish. There ought to have been more on Anakin's jealously of Padme and Kenobi brought into the script and Anakin's impatience about aquiring more force powers. At best the story should've had more to do with Anakin's lust for personal gain rather than any hope of saving Padme. Or, the story could've revolved around the Jedi Council deserving Padme's preganacy with Anakin of course being the father. I don't know why Count Dooku even made an appearance other than for comic relief as he got his head taken off. Then there was the Emperor Palpatine who I thought got his ugly looks from just being old. Turns out that he was scarred from having his powers reflected back on to him. Overall I can't complain.

It was the darkest and most sinister movie I have ever seen in my life, I mean, NON---STOP---DEATH.  I swear, there wasn't one happy scene in that entire film.  Sure, there was some comic relief, but no happiness, just death.  I wanted to cry from all the pure evil taking place (I believe some people actually did cry during the film).  Some scenes were shocking and disturbing as well, at least for me they were.  I applaud George Lucas for not giving in to all those complaints about the movie being PG-13 and whatnot.  Like he said himself, he is trying to tell a story the way he intended, and I believe he has done it perfectly, despite the stupid reviews.  Critics have under rated this movie by far.  And all you people out there who think it sucked, wow, that's sad.  And all of you who think the actors were terrible, I believe no one else could have played the parts.  They set the whole mood of the film.  Hayden Christensen was astounding.  I have never seen anyone act so sinister, ever.  I believe it is safe to say this movie was meant to be sad, not to mention pure evil.  Most people miss the point of it though.  This final film was the connecting point, the time when all the secrets leading to the future are to be revealed.  Too many people dwell on the stupid little things like how Yoda was digital this time around, or how ""bad"" and actor may seem at their part.  The battle scenes rocked (which took up a lot of the movie), the saber duals rocked (pure amazingness), the actors were fantastic, and the whole atmosphere of this movie made it entirely different from the rest.

As for marketing, that and ticket sales are what pays for each following episode. Episode 3 is no doubt paying for both the live action TV series as well as the new animated series (not the super short episode series Clone Wars on Cartoon Network). Anyone out there still not understanding the prequels or perhaps just plain not liking them for supposed bad or ""wooden"" acting, bad dialog, etc. I must point you in the right direction. Find and watch any of the old Flash Gordon serials (or Commando Cody after which one of the clone commanders in Episode 3 was named). Star Wars is fashioned after Flash Gordon. Everything from the opening crawl to the acting to the dialog to the wipes to the editing can all be found there in the Flash Gordon serials. The acting and dialog are as Lucas intended, not because he can't write or they can't act or whatever other rediculous reason some have come up with any of which can be disproved by simply watching anything else any of these people have been involved with. He made the prequels the way he had always intended all of them to be, a sort of homage to the old serials he watched as a child/young man. Check them out.

The revenge of the sith is the best of part 1, 2 and 3, but that is easy to say when you are comparing this film to childish nonsense like The Phantom Menace. Lucas did very wise in casting some great actors again. Ian McDermid for instance really delivers a great performance in playing the Chancellor. The whole movie of course is fun to watch as always, but you just get the feeling it could have been even better.

Other than that the absolutely silly romance between Anikan and Padme and the pathetic dialog between them is painful to watch. There are too many holes in this plot and this movie depends more of FX and  staged Battles  in grand scenery than having a solid plot to drive it. It feels too rushed to fit in to a 2 and 1/2 hour movie. It attempts to doo too much in too short of a time span and this is where the movie really fails to deliver the goods. The few bright moments include the confrontation between Yoda and Darth Sidious and The inevitable battle between Obi-Wan and Lord Vader. I have to say the ""turning"" of Aniken in to Lord Vader was intntreguing but felt a little hollow and dissappointing... It really  didnt show him really go ""over"" the edge in a dramatic way and when he learned of How he was responsible for Padmes eventual death all we got was a halfhearted Nooooooo!! He didnt really seem to be seething with evil as we all know him in the original. He still was confused and had his humanity even though the deeds he did in this film were evil. The film made him feel a guilt about what he did but that wasnt supposed to happen in this film. It should have been a total turn to the dark side and what we got in this film was half hearted at best. And the the scene where he watches Senator Palpatine kill of Sam Jacksons Jedi Character and then say oh what have i done and then in the same instant swear alligance to The Sith Lord was a Joke At best. Totally not beliveable. This film completely lacks the Emotion and Powerful imagery and Plot that the original Trilogy is known for.  To many things about this film were left underdeveloped and lots of things left undone and questions unanswered and things just didnt fit or make sence A prime example of this is if you remember in the Original Saga Luke has fond rememberances of His mother  Padme but how could heknow since she dies after giving birth to him... The only hope is that there will be an extended directors edition to come out on DVD to help fill in too many glaring errors in the release that is presently in theaters. To sum it up this movie lacks the passion and is too rushed to be concidered a worthy finale to the Star Wars Saga.. This only cements and Completes The New Trilogy (1-3) as a complete diaasppointment to those who grew up with The original Star Wars Saga and even George Lucas managed to Screw That up for the DVD release to make it try to ""fit"" into  the new films but that is another story itself... Suffice it to say The Revenge of The Sith is a Good Pop corn flick and not too bad of a way to waste a couple of hours but for those who have been waiting since 1977 for this moment to happen you might walk away dissappointed and thats a shame.

And at this point, probably no one expected it to.  The casting of Hayden Christensen as Anakin/Vader was a very bad choice.  To me, Christensen and Lucas turned Anakin into a whining, pouting character, rather than the truly over-confident, suddenly angry and fierce dark force he eventually became (whom we in the 1970's grew to love).  It was very difficult for me to view the movies in order (1-6) and see the jump from a sniffling, pouty-lipped Anakin to an amazingly scary Dark Sith Lord.  It just didn't work for me.  The Episodes 4-6 are still some of the best movies I've ever seen, even to this day, as I watch them with my 4 year old son, who loves them as much, if not more, than I.	2.0	Pouty Acting	2005-11-02	9	7	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3OPCQYY5JM2TJ	"S B ""sdb70"""	There are a few things about this film that make it worth the price of admission alone:1. The first 7 minutes - the opening battle sequence (along with the accompanying score) - is the BEST of ANY of the six films.  There is no debate - Lucas and Co. finally realized the dream that CGI could produce a superior experience than the original trilogy.2. The five lightsaber duels (Obi-Wan & Anakin v. Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus; Obi-Wan v. General Grievous; Palpatine/Darth Sidious v. 4 Jedi Knights; Yoda v. Palpatine/Darth Sidious; and Anakin/Darth Vader v. Obi-Wan) are the best in the entire six film series.3. The last 15 minutes of the film - the fall of Anakin, coupled with the last 10 minutes of 'Return of the Jedi', are THE most emotional moments of the entire six films.Now we see that the story of Star Wars is about the rise and fall and redemption of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader.  The moral of the story (a subtle one that is rarely explored in film) is that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  For those who were paying attention (and from the critiques below, not many), Anakin's turn to the dark side began in 'Attack of the Clones' with his slaughter of the Sandpeople . . . but that was revenge, and revenge is OK, right?  It continued with his disregard of the Jedi Code in sparking a secret romance/wedding with Padme . . . but that was for love, and love is good, right?  In this film, his fear, paranoia, and frustration with the Jedi's insistence upon taking the higher road, fed by a 3-year war and a growing friendship with Palpatine, finally reaches a crescendo where he literally must choose sides in a split second - destroy the Jedi and lose your wife or join the Sith and save your wife.What is particularly revealing about this film is the realization of Palpatine/Darth Sidious as a complete character.  This installment not only provides a context for the seeds of manipulation that he sowed in the two previous films, but revealed, in a uniquely subtle manner not characteristic of this series, the slipperly nature of evil.Now I do have a few criticisms with this film, which is why I did not give it a 5-star rating.  First of all, it tries to do a little bit too much, in plot and in technicalities.  The film contains 50% of the necessary plot of the prequel trilogy, while the first installment contained about 10% and the second installment contained about 40%.  Many of the battle sequences (in particular, Obi-Wan's pursuit of General Grievous on a running/jumping lizard) are a bit too much.  Finally, it is the absence of Liam Neeson's character, who makes a voice appearance in 'Attack of the Clones', but has an even more significant role in the plot of this film.I have to fault the entire prequel trilogy for its bad dialogue, wooden acting, and most of all, its pacing.	4.0	The payoff . . . and a worthy prequel	2005-10-28	16	12	4

My only complaint is that there are a number of slow passages that seem to go on and on forever. On the other hand there are great battle scenes. I would have a tendency to give it only 3 stars, but because of the really lively fantasy expressed by Lucas I need to give it 4 stars.

It seems that, once again, Lucas has had his ears to the soundboard of public opinion.  He's removed much of the exposition that got in the way in the first two prequels, gotten rid of Jar Jar Binks (except for a harmless cameo at the end), and ramped up the action in what is the most poignant of the series.  We finally see the fall of basically a good man, an honest man who does the wrong things for the right reasons, and ends up becoming what he's faught for most of his life.  Perhaps the greatest of Lucas' archetypes he loves to use.He's severely weakened Padme's character, for reasons I still don't understand.  Part of what made the ""Star Wars"" series great was how females could be just as strong and forthright as the males.  Here, perhaps because she's pregnant (women reading this can freely curse me, but how else can you explain strong, certain Padme becoming an indecisive wreck?), she is reduced to pining for and moping about Anakin.  But this is a small weakness in what amounts to be the best of a weak lot, and can stand shoulder to shoulder with the original as showing the world how crisp a Lucas film, done right, can be.All in all, this is the way the prequels should've been in total, and reminds us that, when he's on, George Lucas is truly a visionary filmmaker."	4.0	"The Best Of The ""New"" Lot"	2006-11-25	4	3	1

Dark and ominous, Lucas nevertheless presents the film in a way that the viewer still believes Anakin will make the right choice, even though we know the conclusion.Listening to the critics of the new trilogy for years, let's set the record straight: We are watching episodes 1,2, and 3 at a severe disadvantage. First of all, we are constantly comparing these to the originals. Second, when episode 4 was released 28 years ago, the special effects and style of film making were totally pioneering. Having reset the standard of how films are made, various movies through the years (Terminator 2, The Abyss, The Matrix, etc.) constantly pushed the envelope to new levels that no other film with today's technology can surpass, even Star Wars. The effects are a dime-a-dozen, and in today's world of high expectations, it is extremely difficult to dazzle the audience with CGI mastery, especially in a film in which we already know the outcome.Also, viewers like myself saw the originals as a kid, a time when our minds were open to the fantastic, and our access to the media was confined to commercially released VHS tapes, rare television access and the occasional trek to the cinema. Now, as adults and in the information age, we look at films much more objectively. With the internet, we can download pictures, previews, and even the movies themselves way before we are legally entitled to see them. As a result, we can force-feed (no pun intended) ourselves the information repeatedly like an addiction until there is nothing left to the imagination.Anakin's turn to the dark side has been a fantasy in the minds every Star Wars fan for years. Since you can let your mind run wild, what you will see in this film may ultimately seem diminished in comparison. Lucas intends for these films to be seen in chronological order. If you can forget for the two hours and twenty minutes you are watching this that episodes 4,5,and 6 exist, you will have to admit that the ending of Revenge Of The Sith would just leave you stunned! You will also now view episode 4 with an entirely new perspective as a result.Lucas did all right, and with another great double DVD to complete the new trilogy. One amazing highlight is the documentary ""Within A Minute"" which shows the process of how many people involved with the production play a part in creating just a sixty-second clip. It will boggle your mind!Overall, I was very impressed. Lucas really pulled a rabbit out of his hat on this one.

The acting espcially between Anakin and Padme is terrible. Anakin has terrible skills at protraying anything remotly convincing, and the dialogue given to Portman is unconvincing and/or contrived. Although the fights are cool, way Anakin goes from 'Oh No! I just killed a Jedi Master' to ""Okay, now I'll go kill children!"" is well...rediculous. Basically most everything about this movie is nothing like it should be. We should see some really powerful movement to the dark side here. All we get is...well I'm not really sure. It just seems kind of blurred, especially with Vader yelling 'NOOOOO!!!' at the end. That was just terrible. Not convincing at all. 2 stars."	2.0	Shallow, Political, and Boring.	2005-09-12	21	8	13

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AW6V35QW9AG2E	sealchan	"In my review of Star Wars I and II I have tried to explain what I think is truly missing from the later pre-trilogy that was profoundly accomplished in the original Star Wars trilogy.  In Star Wars III we have an improvement in the sense of a greater psychological development of character in Anakin.  However, the flaw in Episodes I and II persists.What is lacking in the pre-trilogy is the mythological development of consciousness in a central character.  In Star Wars IV-VI, Luke Skywalker's story is easily equated with well known mythological themes.  This simple fact means that the story will resonate in our hearts and minds on a deeper spiritual level.  In the pre-trilogy (as I call episodes I-III), this is unfortunately lacking.Here is, perhaps, a better description than I have given in my other reviews of what the missing element should be.  First I believe that Obi Wan Kenobi should have been the Luke Skywalker of the pre-trilogy.  Anakin could have been a shadow figure for Obi Wan so that all the implications in the story of the character Anakin/Vader were the failings of Obi Wan.  The tragic scope of this personal spiritual failure on Obi Wan's part, once realized, as it should have been in Star Wars III, or in an interim story between III and IV, would lead naturally to a spiritual explanation for Obi Wan's voluntary defeat in his confrontation with Vader in movie IV (consider Neo's voluntary defeat in Matrix Revelations).  The voluntary defeat is a mythological reference to the Christ sacrifice of the ego for the greater salvation of the entire psyche and is a potentially powerful moment in any story.In Episode IV this strange, seemingly useless, sacrifice on Obi Wan's part could have been spiritually explained if only Obi Wan actively claimed responsibility for Anakin/Vader's fate.  Or, perhaps, a more believable scenario would be Obi Wan realizing he had to get out of Luke's way because deep down Obi Wan knew he would never be able to ""solve"" the problem of Vader that he helped to create.  It is important that Obi Wan be responsible for Vader's behavior somehow, even if only because Obi Wan's own blindness prevented him from intervening.  Without this connection of Obi Wan to Anakin the two characters are just student and teacher and there is no deeper, spiritual connection to bind their fates together with.  To drive the nail into the coffin for this spiritual link even as late as in episode VI we see Obi Wan lamely justifying his having told Luke in episode IV that Vader murdered his father.  Even after death Obi Wan's supposed wisdom seems extremely limited.In a climactic scene in episode I, Obi Wan defeated Darth Maul.  In spite of Darth Maul being out numbered, Maul incapacitated Qui-Gon.  This angered Obi Wan and with that anger Obi Wan defeated Maul.  Here was the seed of darkness that was planted that leads to all else.  In killing Qui-Gon's killer and taking on defiant Qui-Gon's student Anakin, Obi Wan set a bad precedence for the type of Jedi he would be in spite of his good qualities.  He proves, in a vital moment, to be open to the sway of the dark side.  By praying on his affection for his teacher and transfering that to his teacher's ""padawan"", that dark side lead Obi Wan to brake a rule of the Jedi order in an important though subtle way.  Darth Maul, having no other clear purpose in this story than being a nasty-looking baddie, is an extension of the then hidden Sith Lord.  Story-wise and mythology-wise, Darth Maul invokes Obi Wan's dark side and empowers the story for the entire trilogy.  That this was intended by Palpatine/Sith Lord is no great leap.  The fact that the dark side used Obi Wan's love to evil purposes is precisely the openning needed to get the young Jedi trained up for eventual corruption.  ""All is proceding as I have forseen!"" croaks the soon to be Emperor.  This is indeed tragic since we can all relate to Obi Wan's reaction to seeing his mentor cut down.  But this touching scene does not properly convey the darkness associated with it and, therefore, is unconnected to what follows.To put the character of Obi Wan into the story as the nexus of the battle between good and evil within himself would have allowed the whole pre-trilogy to generate those moments we had with the original trilogy.  In the original trilogy so many of us gasped with realization as Luke's character came to some vital realization.  Again for Luke those moments were in episode IV: Luke trusting in the force at a critical moment to fire the torpedo which defeated evil's greatest weapon evidencing the great power of Faith; Episode V: Luke realizing Vader was his father and that his battle was with himself, unwinnable and personal showing that one's greatest enemy is fear and ignorance and that the true battle in life is fought in the heart; episode VI: Luke lays down his saber and his life in faith that good exists in his evil father...and not only accomplishes the utter defeat of the evil Emperor, but the salvation of his father, who in choosing salvation in the sight of the willing sacrifice of his son, has accomplished the fulfillment of the prophecy that he would restore balance to the force.In the pre-trilogy we have the following moments which lack the proper development: episode I: Obi Wan defeats Darth Maul with a definite dose of the dark side's aggression and too soon rises to become mentor to an unruly, passionate boy prodigy; episode II: Obi Wan and Anakin lie on the floor useless as they fail to cooperate (linking back to the climactic episode I fight scene) in their efforts to tackle the faux evil puppet Count Dooku; and episode III: Obi Wan and Anakin's relationship fails altogether when Obi Wan removes three of four of Anakin's limbs.What these scenes could have been were episode I: Obi Wan looses control and succombs to the dark side to defeat Maul and, in spite of his own previously revealed misgivings about his mentor's decision, takes over the training of Anakin (a subtle attitude change in Obi Wan would insinuate a deeper, inner transformation); episode II: after getting Anakin to leave Padme behind, Obi Wan ironically makes some selfish, desperate attempt to protect Anakin from a blow by Dooku that shows Obi Wan doesn't really trust Anakin's skill or power or is jealous of it and Anakin in frustration breaks the cooperative approach only to have himself compromised and useless.  In a moment of distracted disbelief, Obi-Wan too could be compromised leaving Yoda to have to save them.  Here Obi Wan's fear of loosing his student, his connection to Qui-Gon (his guilt over not having saved him) and his justification for going out on a limb with training Anakin against his own better judgement would show up his own growing weakness.  Episode III: Obi-Wan now has to ""helplessly"" watch as he sees himself cut down his own student forcing himself to recognize his own failure.  He realizes that his own bad choice is at the root of it all and his blindness has made all the Jedi blind (or so he thinks).  But how can love lead to this hell of evil in Anakin?  Should we blame Padme reducing her to a temptress?  Was the prophecy wrong?  Making Obi Wan's personal blindness connected to the growing darkness in the vision of Yoda would have helped to implicate Obi Wan himself as the true battlesite where good and evil were coming together.In short Episode III accomplishes an example of a deep, heart renching descent of a good person into evil, but does not connect that development into the universal well-spring of mythic insight that the next three episodes so clearly do.  We could have learned from Obi Wan that having what you want in the short term can turn to the gravest of sins even with the best of reasons.  And perhaps these right choices are beyond human reach, at least not without great suffering.  The universe suffered because the dark side caught Obi Wan off guard.  Yet at the same time as the emperor was seeing all things come about as he had planned, the prophecy of one who would restore the balance of the force to the universe was, nonetheless, fulfilled.  Then we would see that, in the end, in spite of great suffering, or, perhaps, necessarily with suffering's assistance, consciousness and goodness prevail."	4.0	Episode III completes the flawed pre-trilogy	2006-01-13	5	1	4

If anyone has really watched the other movies they would ""know"" that she didn't die in child birth. Fact: In the final movie of the first trilogy when Luke tells Leia that he is her brother he asks her if she remembers her mother, she says yes, a little and only that she was very beutiful but very sad; This implies that she was very much alive and raised her alittle before she died. Apparently Lucas pays no attention to the story lines of his other movies before writing the plots of his new ones. Based on this one item I was very disappointed with Sith because it was based on somthing that was untrue in the original context of the series. It really looked to me like Lucas was just trying to end the trilogy quickly so he threw together a bunch of special effects and a lame story to do so."	3.0	Georges Ending	2005-06-25	19	9	10

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ	Sean Pasek	"No one can ever say that George Lucas is not an incredible visionary.  In fact, I challenge anyone to rival him in this capacity.  The man's mind is always churning out new ideas.  He already knows how everything is supposed to be and how it is supposed to look.Unfortunately, George Lucas is still an average director at best and a poor screenwriter.  The dialogue is still a mess, and the characters lack substance.Despite these problems, Episode III is a great, great film.  The film opens with one of the most incredible battle sequences ever filmed.  George is very good at putting together action sequences, which obviously define much of the Star Wars films.In Episode III, we finally get to see Anakin's final transformation into Darth Vader and what causes him to finally turn to the dark side of the force.  I know many people have been waiting to find out how this is going to take place.Ian McDiarmid, who is by far the best in this film along with Ewan McGregor, is wonderful as he uses subtlety to finally break Anakin and his trust in those around him.  This ""fall"" is far more realistic than the ridiculous attempt on Luke in Return of the Jedi.There are a lot of lightsaber battles in this film.  I, mean, come on.  The lightsaber has got to be the coolest weapon ever conceived of in film history.  And we, as fans, are always up for some lightsaber action.  The final showdown between Obi-Wan and Anakin will not disappoint at all.  It's a great sequence.Natalie Portman is in this film very seldom.  Many of her scenes were cut.  We find out that from the deleted scenes that she spearheads the formation of the Rebel Alliance.  George Lucas felt this wasn't necessary to the film.  I have to disagree.  We shouldn't have to look up deleted scenes to make story connections or to have something explained.George Lucas is obsessed with not allowing a film to run too long.  Perhaps he himself has a problem with long movies?  In fact, in his commentaries, he's constantly saying, ""I didn't want this dialogue to run too long.  I'm afraid people will be bored.""  If a film is good enough, the audience won't be looking at their watches.  Peter Jackson knows this as he's more than demonstrated with the LOTR trilogy.  Better yet, Jackson added tons of footage for the DVD, thus giving the viewer the option of watching the extended versions.  I'm afraid this is something that, unfortunately, never crosses Lucas's mind.  Lucas simply plays down to the audience and views them as unsophisticated people who have to be constantly bribed by action sequences to keep the interest going.  This is why, his films, as good as they are, lack substance and depth, which is unfortunate, as you can see how much better they could be.  Even this film lacks a certain degree of emotional connection as we witness the slaughter of Jedi as well as Anakin's transformation.  Lucas failed to make Anakin likeable enough to where we cringe when he turns to the dark side.  Lucas has said that it's supposed to be tragic, but we don't feel it nearly enough.  Padme's single line of, ""Anakin, you're breaking my heart,"" is a strong line that makes us feel for her, but not for him.Unfortunately, Hayden Christensen's performance is sub-par at best.  It is too bad that George Lucas didn't choose to go with a more seasoned actor.  I'm afraid he's failed in all three of these films with Hayden as well as with Jake.  It becomes more apparent also when they attempt to act across from seasoned actors such as McDiarmid, McGregor, and Portman.John Williams's score is nothing short of masterful.  He, in a lot of ways, makes up for George's lack of emotional depth by using some heartfelt music at certain key moments in the film.Make no mistake, this is an incredible movie which invites many multiple viewings.  There is so much going on in each scene, that you can watch this movie 20 times and still see something you didn't catch before.  George's vision is amazing and so wonderful to be a part of.  I'm sorry that this is the end of the Star Wars films.  I've been a huge fan since the original release back in 1977.  Some believe that he will eventually make episodes 7-9, but I don't know.  George has managed to single-handedly change the way movies are made.  I can't imagine there never being a Star Wars.  I don't want to.The commentary of Star Wars In a Minute is a fascinating look at how all of these people put together just one minute of the film and how many people and hours it takes to achieve this.Sit back and enjoy this film.  My skin still tingles when Darth Vader finally makes his appearance and we hear the defining voice of James Earl Jones.  Darth Vader has to be on of the most compelling characters ever created."	5.0	Lucas finally hits and lands on the high note!	2005-12-17	10	6	4

All the effects are terrific, of course.  The dialogue is mostly cheesy, also of course - no one but a fool ever went to a Lucas film for that.  But it was not guaranteed that the plot and the pacing would be, as they are, first rate.  We see the doomed Jedi making all the wrong decisions, for reasons that come somewhere between right and understandable.  The tragedy of Anakin turns out not just to be what we already knew, but that he does it to save his wife, and turns himself thereby into the cause of her death.  As Padme is dying in childbirth, Anakin is nailed into the body of Darth Vader: the two scenes are intercut.  The result is powerfully moving, unless you have the heart of a New Yorker film reviewer.It's a challenge to make the last piece of a jigsaw exciting, and all the characters rise to it, whatever their composition.  Yoda shines; light sabres are everywhere.  And, since Lucas rules his universe, a character with a standard English accent gets to be the ultimate human hero.A final note on that accent, for any American viewers put off by the New Yorker attack.  It's a good accent.  There is nothing fake about it.  I sound like that myself, and so, unless he's now disguising it, does Anthony Lane."	5.0	Enjoy it, admire it, leave the detractors to their shame	2005-05-21	1	1	0

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T	Sesho	In the endgame of the Clone Wars, Count Dooku, leader of the Seperatists, and his cyborg general, Grievous, have taken Chancellor Palpatine captive and a battle rages in Coruscant orbit to win his freedom. Speeding through the laser bursts of dog-fighting ships and droids are Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi who have taken it upon themselves to rescue the leader (some would say dictator) of the Republic. Starting with the confrontation with Dooku, Anakin almost too rapidly begins to fall to the dark side of the Force. His growing obsession with power and the forked tongue of his supposed friend and mentor Palpatine and dark nightmares about his wife Padme are all signposts for the twilight path he must walk down.Of the 3 prequel films this is the best, and I would say the third best of all 6, coming in behind Empire and the original 1977 Star Wars. Finally, the characters show some emotion. I don't know but the first kiss scene in Attack of the Clones with the symphony swelling up just seemed a little hokey and contrived to me. Here, we do get some shading to their relationship in some beautiful shots right out of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Hayden Christensen is finally able to show some poise in Revenge, whereas in his first stint he seemed a little overwhelmed with the legend of the films. Here he fits right in, and is able to show the conflict that Luke always kept harping on in Return of the Jedi. Anakin does some truly horrible things in this film, simply because he never stops to think. He acts purely on what he desires. There are moments you can sense where he could have turned back to the light, but Anakin is just too immature, to naive, to bring himself back up from the depths.Ewan McGregor does the best job in the film, but he's always been the best actor in this series. He's able to speak the Lucas dialogue and always seem distinguished and natural. Ian McDiarmid unfortunately hams the screen up a bit too much, especially once he no longer has to play Mr. Nice Guy. He overacts at times and seems too much like a villain from a Pokemon movie.Anakin's fall seems a little too easy, but stems from the fact that Lucas did not start Episode I with Anakin as a young adult. If Hayden could have played the role over three films, these prequels could have been masterpieces. The fall of Anakin, and especially the love story would have had much more heft and the characters would have had longer to develop. Even in Revenge there are scenes which could have been done either better or expanded that just cried out for dramatic development. This should have been a 3 hour movie like Lord of the Rings.	4.0	FALLING IN LOVE WITH THE DARK SIDE	2005-11-23	1	1	0
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ANF5BP1SD3Z3O	Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix 01	I watched the first trilogy as a kid and these films are good for many reasons.  You realize the complexity of the storyline and the special effects are just beyond imagination.The plot is worthy of Star Wars and it is important to see Darth Vader's fall from grace to the dark side.  This is darker and the open portrayal of Darth Vader as an assassin and child murderer show how far his character has fallen.  This film definately earned its rating because of subject matter and the graphic way Vader's injuries are shown.The only reason I have subtracted a star is the acting.  The first trilogy had better actors.  This trilogy either had mediocre actors in big roles or good actorsin scenes that were underwritten, especially relationship scenes, in some instances the computer generated characters are better actors than the human beings.The most frustrating performance is Hayden Christensen's.  I wanted to like him and to be fair his performance got better toward the end.  I really believed him more in this the final film of the first trilogy.What finally convinced me that his acting was off was that the most chilling moment in this film was hearing James Earl Jones say Vader's final line in the film.  He caused more of an emotional chill in one line using only his voice than Hayden Christensen caused using his voice, facial expressions and body language in two films.While this is a mild distraction it does not detract too much from the film and it is still a great ending to the trilogy.	4.0	Chilling end to this trilogy	2007-04-19	5	2	3

Jackson,who plays Mace Windu,does a good job as well.Natalie Portman,who plays Anakian's wife and Luke and Leia's mother,Padme,isn't given much to do this time around,but she does quite well.Hayden Christensen was amazing in this film.While some may say he was awful in Clones,I thought he did a great job.However, since he does a much better job in this film,he should satisfy the fans and prove he is a great choice for the role.And Anthony Daniels(C-P30),Kenny Baker(R2-D2),Peter Mayhew(Chewbacca),and James Earl Jones(the voice of Darth Vader)are good,despite the fact their not in the film much.And I say the best performance is by far Iam McDiarmid as Palpatine.He goes from what seems to be a good man to the evil Sith lord and he does so remarkably.He so uttery convincing in this role,he makes all the other performances pale in comparison.In short,he deserves a Oscar nod for his performance.Now,the technical achievements.This film looks absolutely incredible.The visual effects are spectacular.Even thing to Grievous,to Yoda,to the fires of Mustafar,you completely believe what you seeing.In fact,only a couple of scenes look like bluescreen.The rest just looks unbelieveable.The plot-this was actually a brilliant story.Before this film and the other two prequels,we all thought Anakian was just pure evil.One of the great things about this trilogy is you see Anakian wasn't a evil person.Anakian was a great man.He just didn't pick the right decisions and you feel sorry for him because of what Palpatine did to him.In truth,Palpatine was always the main villian of this series and not him.This film makes his turn to the dark side really convicing and although it is unbelievely dark and tragic,you know in the end it works out because of Episodes IV-VI.Anyway,if you love Star wars,you will love this story.As good as the film was,it did have some problems:First,as I said before Natalie isn't given much to do,which is disapointing,because she was good in the first two.Secondly,the Wookie planet scenes.These scenes aren't bad,but they aren't as long as they could have been and Chewbacca is only in three scenes.Third,as a fan of Jar-Jar,I felt that Lucas at least should have had given him a better final scene that what he gave him(he doesn't die,for those who were wondering).And finally,as slow as the first two were,Episode III has incredibly fast pacing.This could be look as a bad thing or a good thing,depending on your point of view.As much as like the fact the film didn't drag,things in the movie happen a bit too quickly,such as the Death Star being constructed at the very end and shown completed in the next episode.I don't think it could have taken 19 years to build that thing,but then again,that's just me.Anyway,if you are a fan of Star Wars,and hated the first two films(I like them,but some people don't and I respect that),Episode III is the film you have been waiting for.See this while you still hve the chance.May the force be with you!!!!!!Best to Worst-------------6.The Phantom Menace5.Attack of the Clones4.A New Hope3.Return of The Jedi2.The Empire Strikes Back1.Revenge of the SithThere are all five star films,though.	5.0	Thank you,Lucas!!!!!!!

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A18IK6YI6T3RK2	Shannon Deason	Finally, after the dismal Phantom Menace, and the long and tedious Attack of the Clones, we get the movie we were waiting for, this is a return to the quality of the prequels. I remember waiting in line for The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi, and being thrilled at the special effects and story line, I was downright angry when I saw Phantom Menace, with that insipid Jar Jar, and how dumbed down it was, as someone who grew up with the prequels, I felt betrayed and Lucus, of course could care less, he makes it clear it's his vision and if you don't like it you don't have to see it, thus I did not see Clones until it came to DVD and I saw this one only when my friends said it was good..and it is very good, the special effects are great and Christianson is much better, though Portman is still awful, what the hell is that accent, it's bizzare and she has NO chemistry with Christianson, but I love the actor who plays the Emperor he is fantastic and he makes this movie..the scene on the planet of fire is spectacular and it is so interesting to a Star War's fan like me to see how exactly Skywalker becomes Vador, it did not disappoint though a bit Frankensteinish.  This DVD has nice extra's, the deleted scenes being the best.  I highly recommend this DVD, this movie was almost worth siting through Menace and Clones...but not quite.	4.0	Return Of A Great Movie	2006-02-16	2	1	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2X4J7BSWDRXEF	Sharilyn Miller	As movies go, this one was just OK. The action sequences and special effects were fun to watch, but that's not why I go to the movies. I go to see an interesting story with engaging characters. You won't get that with Star Wars 1, 2, or 3. The story is OK but not particularly original, the acting (except for Natalie Portman) is pretty awful, and the script! Ugh! And there is absolutely NO chemistry between any of the characters. It's total dullsville from beginning to end.I'm a huge fan of Star Wars episodes  4, 5, and 6. In these films you got some great characters with believable personalities, plenty of action, a story you care about, and  while the special effects are now somewhat dated, who cares? The story is what matters. I have watched these episodes over and over again, and I never really tire of the stories they tell. I love the way the characters interact with each other and the little bits of humor thrown in. But all of the charm is lost with episodes 1, 2 and 3. I saw each film one time, then never again. I hate to say it, but George needs to hire a decent script writer before I'll ever see another one of his films.	2.0	a just-OK movie	2005-07-07	21	10	11

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A184SHDQWWM8KF	sharonl23	"If you have ever witnessed someone surrender to their worst fears and most selfish ambitions, even on a small scale, then ""Revenge of the Sith"" will be painful. I am embarrassed to confess I cried through the last third of the film, which is an unusual reaction for me.  I am rarely that shaken by a movie.I absolutely love this film.  It rendered me speechless.  By the end the pieces have perfectly fallen into place.  Obviously we all know where the story is going but luckily, George Lucas has the wisdom to know that its how the story unfolds that is the point.The film opens with a dizzying and exhilarating battle sequence with our two heroes, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), trying to free Chancellor Palpatine from the possession of the evil Count Dooku and the new villain Gen. Grievous, an alien-droid hybrid.  Once Anakin kills Dooku, with encouragement from Palpatine, a series of events and decisions are set into motion which will seal Anakin's tragic fate.The beguiling Palpatine (a mesmerizing Ian McDiarmid) soon begins to deftly manipulate Anakin, knowing that the young Jedi is ready to reach towards anyone who speaks to his boiling ambitions and deepest insecurities.  These sequences are a quiet and delicate dance, terrifying to watch.Anakin's inner conflicts continue to be stirred as his clandestine marriage to Padme (the radiant Natalie Portman) divides his loyalties especially after learning she is carrying their child and that her life may be in danger.  His eventual decision to align with Palpatine leads him to commit incredible horrors.  And for the record, anyone who is not moved by Padme's anguish later in the film when she must face what the man she deeply loves has turned into truly has a cold heart.As I was watching the turbulent relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin unravel I suddenly realized I had underestimated the importance of Qui-Gon Jinn's absence from Anakin's life.  Kenobi is a great hero who exemplifies all that a Jedi should be, whether we see him as an elegant but battle-worn gentleman (Alec Guinness) or an electrifying warrior and leader (McGregor).  But unlike Jinn he did not have the experience to protect and arm his prot&eacute;g&eacute; against the rage and frustration lurking deep within and around him. He failed to aggressively keep Anakin and Padme apart, and didn't have the heart to kill a young man he loved like a brother.The second half of the film feels like a freefall as war rages, the innocent are betrayed and murdered, and all but a few Jedi are extinguished.  A great society is brought to its knees, its majesty swallowed whole by greed and oppression.There's an impressive fight between Yoda and Palpatine which is fantastic but it's the inevitable duel between Obi-Wan and Anakin that draws our attention. Fought in what looks like the bowels of hell, it is an unparalleled exhibition of two great warriors at the height of their powers.  This battle was far more painful to watch than I had anticipated and well worth the wait.  Anakin is left brutally wounded and nearly dead which leads to a frightening scene where we get to see the black uniform and mask placed on him for the first time.I have to admit that I have been a bit surprised by the constant whining and complaining about the first two prequels.  I happen to love all of the movies.  Years ago I too fell into the trap of trying to compare these films with each other.  But then I realized that's impossible since they are all part of one continuous story.  Debating which ""Bond"" film, for example, is the best is reasonable because it is basically the same movie told several different ways.  Looking at the ""Star Wars"" films that way is not valid.If you're someone who has been infected with cynicism, then these films aren't for you.  If you are sitting there tapping your finger waiting for Vader to appear so you can root against him again like the old days, then you will never fully embrace the prequels or, for that matter, ""Return of the Jedi"" which now resonates much more strongly now that all the pieces are in place.  By the way, I was so thrilled to see Christensen as the younger Anakin placed at the end of ""Jedi"" (DVD) with Obi-Wan and Yoda.  Once he committed to the dark side Anakin died, just as Obi-Wan told Luke, making his appearance at the end of ""Jedi"" essential.The story of the prequels has unfolded exactly as it had to, exactly as explained by Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) in the original trilogy.  A lot of people seemed to be expecting that young Anakin would be a little devil child with horns and beady red eyes who breathed fire every time he disagreed with his master.  There's nothing to explore in that scenario. The story is how good people can turn into the worst version of themselves.  Hayden Christensen has shown great depth and complexity in portraying a young man who possesses in his soul equal parts darkness and light and chooses to follow the darkness, to take the easy way out.  The story works because he is all of us.  We all have the potential to do selfless good or unspeakable evil.For those who grew up with these movies like I did, there is a strong resistance to accept Anakin as the heart of these films instead of Luke.  People always get angry when they feel like the rug has been pulled out from under them.  It's a shame because they are missing out on something exceptional.  But for those of us who figured out many years ago that everything was not as it seemed, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is an extraordinary close to an astonishing movie experience.  Thanks for the ride Mr. Lucas!"	5.0	a heartbreaking close to the circle	2005-06-10	11	9	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A38S8RD8XOXLVS	"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic"""	"Revenge of the Sith should have been The Godfather of the science fiction genre, a powerful human tragedy about a good man corrupted by evil. However, because of George Lucas' inability to tell a compelling story about people, Anakin Skywalker will never be the powerful tragic figure Michael Corleone still is today.It's a shame George Lucas told the stories of the prequel trilogies from a technical/historical perspective and not a human one. What made the Original Star Wars Trilogy so great was the focus on the lives of ordinary people brought together by this intergalactic war. What makes the ""Prequel"" trilogy so horrible is the focus on major historical events of the war and not the people who defined them.Throughout Sith Lucas sees the intergalactic war of the Trade Federation and the Galactic Republic as something that happened in the past and treats Anakin's story as just one of the events in history. Due to this past viewpoint and historical perspective of the story, Lucas fails to develop Anakin into a three-dimensional character I could relate to. Because the story and the characters are so one dimensional, I have no reason to care about Anakin's story or his relationships with the other characters like Papaltine, Padame, The Jedi Council or Obi Wan. When Anakin turns to the Dark Side it has no impact on me. It's just another insignificant event in the larger history of the Star Wars universe. This type of indifferent perspective is good for a history book, bad for a movie where we need to care about the characters in order to be involved with the story.There are all these great tragic stories about people affected by this intergalactic war in Sith. However, without the three-dimensional human characters to give them depth and dimension, they have no heart and no soul. Sith quickly deteriorates from a tragic movie into a poorly made series of intergalactic history channel documentary reenactments with the artificial feel of a LucasArts PC game. In just two and a half hours, the Galactic Republic falls, most of the Jedis are all killed, Anakin becomes Darth Vader, the twins are born, Padame dies of a broken heart (ridiculous) and Obi-wan and Yoda go into seclusion. Roll Credits and go buy your Commemorative Star Wars Memorabilia at the concession stand. Sith is an indifferent and apathetic movie going experience, nothing like the enjoyable event I enjoyed being a part of watching Return of the Jedi when I was ten years old in 1983.Because of Lucas' obsession with only technical aspects of the film, the acting from the humans is horrible in this movie. I won't be too hard on the actors; they aren't the reason Revenge of the Sith is a disaster. That blame falls squarely on George Lucas' shoulders. He micromanaged the actors so much that they couldn't perform well. He nitpicked the way every line was said, they way every facial expression was made; the way every lightsaber stroke was slashed. Having been micromanaged myself in jobs, I can tell you no employee performs well in this type of environment. Someone needs to tell Mr. Lucas that movie projects are a collaborative effort and you have to trust your actors' ability to perform if you want them to act naturally.Due to the micromanaging, Hayden Christensen is wretched in the role of Anakin Skywalker. He says his no lines with any emotion, he has no chemistry with Ian McDarmind Ewan McGregor or Natalie Portman. His ""expressions"" of anger are sadly a laugh riot. Natalie Portman is just a nightmare as Padame Amidala. She says her lines as if she were reading them off the page. Samuel L. Jackson gives his second worst performance in a movie (see The Man for the first) as Mace Windu. He looks so stressed out in some scenes it's just troubling. Ian McDarmind hams it up as Papaltine taking the character way over the top. Ewan McGregor tries to add dimension to Obi-Wan Kenobi, but the script he's given is too puerile to work with. Jimmy Smits is the only actor to perform well in this movie. In his limited time onscreen, he gives Senator Bail Organa the dimension needed to make me care about him. With the exception of Smits, everyone should just take this trilogy off the resume on the back of their headshots. It's just not their best work.Perhaps the greatest tragedy of these three disastrous prequel films is what transpired behind the camera over the past sixteen years. In his isolation, George Lucas, a once hardworking good man has become so corrupted by wealth, greed, and power (The Dark Side of Hollywood) that he no longer understands what human elements make a movie great. ROTS and the entire prequel trilogy will sadly go down in history as just another by-product of today's corrupted moviemaking craft that thinks fake looking computer generated special effects are superior to compelling human storytelling and character development. Hollywood filmmakers like Lucas have become so obsessed with what computers can do that the art of movies is losing its humanity. And without a human touch, fantasy movies like ROTS just aren't realistic enough to be compelling to the audience.Some advice to the former gurus of the Science Fiction and fantasy genre such as George Lucas, Steven Speilberg, The Wachowski Brothers, and the people at Paramount who let the Star Trek collapse into a black hole: Science Fiction and fantasy are stories about PEOPLE. The primary focus of the story is the human characters relate to each other and how they live life in these strange and exotic worlds. The main point is to make a commentary our modern society and the culture of today. All those aliens on the screen and those high tech widgets are secondary to the stories about the relationships of the characters.Play a Jedi Mind trick on yourself. Episodes I, II and III do not exist. Episodes IV, V, and VI are the only parts of the true Star Wars saga."	1.0	Play a Jedi Mind trick on yourself. pretend this trilogy doesn't exist.	2005-11-28	45	32	13

Kruse ""Shredder1138"""	Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith is the film every Star Wars fan has been waiting to see since 1977. The film opens with a massive battle at the hight of the Clone Wars. The film fills in almost every gap between Episode II and Episode IV, even answers the question of how Obi Wan came to be in posession of Anakin's lightsaber. The visual effects are amazing, the story is well written, and serves every true Star Wars fan's need to see how that cute little boy in Episode I becomes the menacing Darth Vader.	5.0	By far the best of the Prequels.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3PIJJ4J2DDI6Q	"Shawn M. Warswick ""High School History Teacher"""	A long time ago, in 1977 George Lucas gave us Star Wars: A New Hope, and the film industry was changed forever.  Now, 27 years later, the sage comes to an end, and what an end it is!In classic Star Wars fashion the audience is thrown right into the middle of the action as the film opens with the Battle of Coruscant and the Supreme Chancellor in the hands of the evil Count Dooku (or Darth Tyrannus, which ever name you prefer).  Of course, as we all know, the Chancellor isn't what/who he appears to be.  He is, in fact, Darth Sidious, and this is just one more ploy in his epic plot to take over the galaxy and destroy the Jedi.As the drama unfolds we see Anakin's fall is not as clear cut was we thought, but we also see he makes the choice to join the dark side.  He knows what he is doing and he makes the choice willingly, hoping (or believing) he will be able to live with Padme in the end.  Of course, he ends up loosing her and his humanity in the end.My favorite sequence was the final epic lightsaber duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan which was interspersed with scenes from the battle between Yoda and Darth Sidious.  The cinematography was great, as was the choreography.  The music, well, it's great but that's no surpirse. This one will certainly make many people happy and hopefully replace the bad taste they had after the first two (which I personally enjoyed).As for the DVD extras: what can I say?

I did enjoy it when I saw it on the screen. I was excited when it made IMDB's top 250 briefly. But I wasn't shocked when it dropped off. But, I have very little desire to see it on DVD. The story centers on Anakin and he's just not likable. He's mean. And at times an over-emotional wus. I don't see any chemistry between him and his costar. And he's incredibly weak to be so easily manipulated. Not one character in the 2nd trilogy has had a chance to develop from Phantom Menace to Revenge of the Sith. There time on screen is cut as scenes that deal with their motives and character are deleted and left for the DVD release in favor of some type of digital special effect we haven't seen yet. This movie isn't really bad. But it's not memorable either. The climax where Vader screems ""no"" when he realizes his love is gone is cliche to the point of being almost laughable. But most importantly, the lack off connection I make with any of the lead characters prevented me from caring if Anakin ever turned bad. And that doomed this story from the before Lucas ever began filming."	2.0	Some Movies Grow On You	2005-10-06	35	12	23

Isn't that what most of the Star Wars experience is about; the special effects? Besides, some of the CGI's were stunning. I loved General Grievous, I mean how could he possibly be any cooler? And yes he does have quite the couch, but I'm sure you would too if your lungs were crushed and you somehow managed to live through it. anyways this movie is spectacular I loved Anakin's slow transformation from a noble jedi to a dark and powerful Sith Lord. Ok, the whole ""NOOOOOOOO"" thing at the end when he was crowned Darth Vader could have been refined, but how could this transformation be done any better? The acting was also a fine point.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2DWYHRXJJZHNX	"Sinis ""a7xcurse"""	In May of 1999, fans of the epic space opera Star Wars lined up at their local movie theater to view one of the most hyped films of all time.  After all, it was the prequel to a film trilogy that everyone had grown up with and considers more than just movies.  Star Wars is a pop icon, simple as that.  With characters easy to relate to, a simple tale of good vs. evil, groundbreaking visuals and audio, and themes and motifs that all could appreciate, Star Wars is by far the greatest trilogy of all time.  So it would be appropriate that there would be hype and lofty expectations to go along with Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.  When I first saw the film, I was amazed.  There was no movie I had seen in a long time that recaptured that good ol' Star Wars feel.  And the concluding montage of battles was amazing and laced with a breakneak pace.  But when I let the film soak in, I realized it was rather weak.  The storyline was very poor, the characters were stale (aside from Jedi Masters Qui-Gon and Yoda), and the character known as Jar Jar Binks had more screentime than Obi-Wan Kenobi, which is truly sad.  Genius George Lucas took such a beloved series with beloved characters and simply got rid of that and replaced them with horrible CGI and pathetic plot progression.  There was no feeling of adventure and excitement, there was no feeling of pain for the protagonist, there was no hatred toward the antagonist.  Instead we got one of the villains with the most potential as being great in movie history.  Darth Maul had what it took to be the main villain in the whole prequel trilogy, but instead died like that of Boba Fett.  Nevertheless, three years later I was ready for the next Star Wars film.  I have to admit, I was somewhat skeptical.  Could you blame me?  The Phantom Menace was the biggest dissapointment for me as a Star Wars fan, it was hard to digest.  But when I first began to watch Attack of the Clones, I was completely sucked in.  The swashbuckling adventure missing from the first movie was back.  There was mystery, action, great CGI (mostly), likeable characters, and it was paced rather well.  The only letdown was the poor dialogue between Anakin and Padme at several points in the film, but it wasn't enough to sour my Star Wars experience.  There even was some darkness in the movie, though not as much as I wanted.  I wished to have seen Anakin slaughter more people and show his turn to the darkside beginning.  However, we did see some of it and we saw his brashness, and his desire to be powerful to help others from dying.  We all know that desire evolves into the desire to control the galaxy and marks his complete turn to the darkside.  Which brings us to Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.  From viewing the terse trailer, I must say that this will be the best of the prequels and probably fall behind The Empire Strikes Back in terms of ranking.  And the reason lies in the fact that it will be the darkest of them all.  I have waited for this since the conclusion of Return of the Jedi.  I always imagined the Republic to be dark, gritty and ominous.  I always wanted to see Anakin's defection to the darkside and his transformation to the evil Darth Vader.  My prayers have been answered, for the trailer showed a much different Star Wars.  The overall theme appears to be the burden of defeat, which is what I want to see.  I want to see Palpatine kick Yoda's butt.  I want to see Anakin fight Obi-Wan with no regrets.  I want to see Anakin kill a human, with no mercy.  After all, this is Darth Vader.  The one who hunted down the Jedi Knights.  I want to see the destruction of the Republic and the formation of the Empire.  This movie will be dark and the themes will be much more enoyable as a result.  When Frodo and Sam began their walk up Mount Doom, and the music kicked in, you got a feeling of excitement that overwhelmed you.  You realized this epic trilogy is coming to an end.  Will the same feeling be there when Anakin and Obi ignite their sabers for one final battle on the volcanic planet Mustafar?  I believe so.  This will be the single most important film in history.  More so than Citizen Kane or the Godfather.  This is the last Star Wars film.  Of course it will be good.  I hope it will be PG-13, for I need more violence and frightening images.  Who doesn't see this movie when it comes out in May 19, 2005 needs to reassess themselves.  You owe it to yourself.  Feel the Force one last time.  Or you will truly regret not doing so.	5.0	A Different Star Wars	2004-12-09	12	8	4

Sith and Separatist were the Good Guys!!!If I hadn't watched Episodes 4-6, I would have thought that the Sith and Separatist were the good guys and Jedi and Galatic Republic were evil. Sith hadn't tyrannized the galaxy yet and they hadn't blown up Aldreaan; indeed they hadn't done anything that can be classified as *evil* upto the end of this movie.Sith and Separatist were fighting to Secede and become Independent from the Galatic Republic. That means they were fighting for Self-Government and that makes them the freedom fighters and Jedi the agents of oppression who are bringing the boot of centralized tyranny on the far corners of galaxy.The movie needed some major acts of evil by Sith, but contained not a single such act. On the contrary, it made Jedi look evil for trying to suppress attempts by the separatists to free themselves of the yoke of the Coruscant Boot.2.) Anakin Skywalker made the Right Choice!!!Anakin did what any self-respecting man would do for his woman.Anakin Skywalker made the right decision in prefering his woman over a mythical entity ""Galatic Republic"" which was more or less a gang of bureaucrats, politicians and weirdo aliens. Anakin Skywalker chose his love over the dogmatic nonsense called the ""Jedi Code"" and this was also a Right choice. So how exactly did he turn to evil???It seems to me, it is the Jedi who acted foolishly and dogmatically and not Anakin Skywalker.Now I will list some other major Errors and Faults of this movie:- The Jedi code is a real piece of buffonery. Jedi Knights can't marry or keep a woman??? Just where do the Jedi's think their future recruits are going to come from? Thin air! In all their *wisdom* the Jedi's can't see that not allowing their Best and Brightest to reproduce only hampers their future? Dsygenicst fools!- How was Jedi Master Mace Windu able to come close to almost defeating Emperor Palpatine, but Yoda(the most powerful jedi), was unsuccessful?- Obi Wan Kenobi was stupid enough to not even make sure he had killed off Anakin Skywalker? Really!!! A professional warrior can be that big of a fool???- How did all those powerful Jedi's were so easily killed off by the Clone Army? In Original Series, Rebel Alliance soldiers are able to fight Imperial Stormtroopers, but these top warriors of the galaxy - The Jedi Knights - the whole lot of them were simply finished off by a bunch of Stormtroopers????"	2.0	Sith & Separatists are the Good Guys and Anakin made the Right Choice!!!	2005-11-18	10	5	5

Kochel ""Sam K"""	"Hello, if you like this review I would love your vote as I am in a review writing competition!!! So here's my best shot at for this one.Of the 3 new movies this is the best. The first was completely ruined by Jar-Jar Binks, and everything good was destroyed by him. The second was good, but upon reflection this is the best of the new ones.So, I hope you liked my review, and that you vote for it! Thanks.-SamIn this movie the transformation to Vadar is complete which brings the movies full circle, and we see the birth of Luke and Lea, which is of paramount importance. The movie also has, besides the story line, great scenes. The opening scene with Kenobi and Skywalker is outstanding and the closing battle of the two of them is nothing short of spectacular!There is not much for Padame to do in this one, but the Emperor comes out and we get to see Yoda fight and Mace too. These are all great scenes and the movie is full and well rounded, and, as I said before, comes full circle to complete the cycle.Next, the DVD is awesome because it has many special features! Excellent interviews and neat insights into how the fights are choreographed and the special effects created.Finally, this movie is an excellent choice for a present for the following reasons:-Movies that are not too dramatic and full of ""eye-candy"" and action are easy to watch over and over, this is one of those movies-There is romance, action, special effects, adventure: something for all-The movie is acceptable viewing for ALL ages, except perhaps quite little kids, but other than that the whole family can watch this together and it's good for when kids come over as company.Other than that, doesn't everyone like Star Wars?"	5.0	A GREAT Present & The best of the new 3: Here's why	2005-12-09	10	5	5
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2PJUHR9LD9XKZ	Skywalker	"...but it's not as if it really had a chance to save much.Honestly, folks, what was always so magical and fascinating for us as viewers about the classical Star Wars saga? What it was really about was ""the Force"" - and in these prequel films precisely this was turned into something unimportant bordering on ridiculous. From what I learned, George Lucas believes - or at least used to believe - into this mysterious energy holding the universe together, due to an experience he made as a young man when he was laying in a coma for days fighting with death after an accident. Afterwards, he had the intention to dedicate a grand story to this transcendental experience (it is not casual that the protagonist was named ""Luke""), and with his first Star Wars film this succeeded very well, although during the second and third one ""the Force"" already lost some of its importance.The three prequel films were past due in order to round up the story, although the disadvantage is that they will ruin the suspense for every new fan who will start watching first the prequel, because this way the shocking end of Episode V ""The Empire Strikes Back"" will no longer come as a surprise.""Revenge of the Sith"" does its best to stir the viewer's compassion with Anakin's horrible fate, but nevertheless, similarly to the first two prequel films, it is not in the least as affecting and thrilling as the classical trilogy. The prequels are a homage to US American blockbusters, stuffed with sometimes stunning special effects (the run on special effects was started precisely with the first Star Wars film), displaying at times wonderful pictures, a marvellous soundtrack (with the first Star Wars film John Williams made the cinema rediscover classical symphonic music for soundtracks); but none of this pays homage to ""the Force"" any longer, and precisely for this reason the prequel films do not manage to charm the viewers with the fairy-tale-like magic of the three classical films.The disclosure made in Episode I that ""the Force"" is something of simply biological origin already destroys every enchantment and was an extremely unintelligent move by the film makers. That Anakin allegedly does not have a father and is thus presented as some kind of second Jesus is even worse. That he crosses the path to the ""dark side"" in order to protect his wife is about the worst idea of all: as if the film makers wanted to tell the nerdy viewers ""Love only brings trouble - folks, keep playing on your computers!"" Apart from that, the connection to the classical films is destroyed by this film, since Leia could remember her mother and thus Amidala couldn't have died so romantically-tragically right after having given birth to her and Luke.Anakin's characterisation is and remains contradictory and incomprehensible right to the end: what was his perdition after all - fear, anger, arrogance, lust for power? Or was he indeed only a ""fool for love""? This wouldn't fit in the least to the Darth Vader character we get to know in the classical trilogy, who never mentions his wife with a single word, though at least in the end he does acknowledge his children. Is this supposed to be romantic? The dialogues between Amidala and Anakin are almost unbearably cheap. Han's and Leia's simple ""I love you"", ""I know"" were much more moving by comparison. Same goes for Obi-Wan: is this supposed to be Anakin's best friend? You rather gain the impression that he envied Anakin from start to finish, almost hated him, and not in the least that he wanted to save him from himself.Star Wars is a fairy tale story, you can see that clearly from the mysterious background provided by ""the Force"", the black-white pattern, the protagonist being a princess, the beginning lines ""Once upon a time..."" But these three films no longer are fairy tales, they are some kind of techno-bubble wrapped up in silk. There was a good reason why Luke switched off the technology at the end of the first classic film: because he knew he could rely on the Force alone. These three new films wouldn't survive without all the technology and special effects, because they don't have much more to offer.The enormous investment in setting, costumes, effects etc. result only in making these films more boring: though they were made with far less budget, the classic films were breathtaking from the first to the last minute. The only prequel film I saw twice was ""The Phantom Menace"" - that is, I didn't really see it the second time, I got so bored I switched it off after about twenty minutes. After that, I didn't even bother to watch the second and third prequel film a second time.If anything, these films go to prove again that it's not lack of money that makes a film bad, it's the lack of inspiration. It seems as if the - last but not least financial - enormous success of the Star Wars films brought Lucas off the right track and made him tell the prequels of his saga in the way of common US American blockbusters, devoid of the philosophical and psychological depth and message of the classic trilogy. Someone ought to have told him ""Cobbler, stick to thy last."" Well, I guess some people did. But it appears he turned a deaf ear to it."	3.0	The best part of the Star Wars prequel trilogy (spoiler alert)	2013-06-23	2	1	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A36UV1G8A3YBRR	"S. Lawhorne ""DP LAW"""	This review of Revenge of the Sith is based on only seeing it once, it will probably change after seeing it 2 or 3 more times to get the full effect. Star Wars is one of the few films that you usually have to see more than once to appreciate everything that is in the frame, so this review is soley on first impressions.This is will a spoiler free review, and it's meant to be guide for the general audience and not a SW fanboy who will love or hate just because they are a SW fanboy.Set 3 years after EP II AOTC, The clone wars is reached it's biggest and most climatic stage and that is the daring kidnapping of the Supreme Chancellor by Separtist General Grevious. Of course Anakin and Obiwan are the ones sent in to rescue him. What happens next is pure action and adventure. A huge space battle with thousands of ships. What this film really shows off well is not only the special effects that Lucas and his ILM team have put together but it's really displaying the Master/apprentice relationship that many people thought was seriously lacking in EP I and II between Obiwan and Anakin. They work great together in this film.Now with the pro's and the con's of this film.PRO'S:The acting and relationships between the characters is the best it's been in the PT which is saying a lot.The relationship between Anakin and Obiwan, Anakin and Padme and most importantly Anakin and Palpatine are very good. Ian Mcdirmad performances goes from a laughable dense in the beginning of the movie to a completly aggresive/arrogant evil person which he really is. He is like the Clark Kent of villans. On the outside he looks like he could never hurt a fly but when his true ways are revealed look out. The only thing I didn't like that much about the Emperor in this movie was in some scenes I couldn't help but laugh when he was fighting, because there are two scenes in particular that make him out to be a out of control deranged nut who seems careless which doesn't fit who this character is. Other than that we now know why the Emperor is so powerful.The special effects are very well done. The planets and background plates were very cool and special effects has come a long way since 2002.The movie runs very fast. It doesn't screw around. It gets from point A to point B really fast, which is a good thing for some but a bad thing for others.Overall the story wraps up all the questions and loose ends more or less. However you need to see this movie more than once if you want things spelled out more clearly about other questions you may still be having as to who was Anakin's father? ROTS bridges the PT with the OT very well and many people will want to pop in EP IV when they get out of the movie.Con's:First off I didn't like the pacing of the film. Lucas is known for making his film in the editing room and this film sticks out like a sore thumb to me of a movie that has been reduced down to it's smallest and most simple form. I spoiled myself silly prior to seeing this film and I know many of the scenes that didn't make the cut, and a couple of them should have remained in the final cut. There some scenes that just leave you hanging and then 2 or 3 scenes later our characters are back together and your left scratching your head going how did this guy know where this little green guy was and how did that guys know where this other guy was. The film is really choppy in that sense.Also due to the speed of the film it may feel like your being force fed everything and if you miss something then oh well. That is not audience friendly. Some scenes especially at the end of the movie needed to slow down and give more of a dramatic effect.The music is my favorite part of the SW movies. I have the ROTS Soundtrack and I love it, but watching the movie the score is a filler and really doesn't stand out very much during the movie. I don't know maybe this will change upon further viewings but the score was once again carved up and a lot of recycled material from EP I and II was used again which to me is annoying but that is just me.The Duels in this film upon my first viewing was not jaw dropping at all. They are so fast and erratic that you can't really appreciate them like I could in the other films.So overall my biggest complaint about this film right now is the pacing. It was just too fast, now maybe that was just the expectations and adrenaline rushing while seeing it at midnight or there really is a problem with. Once again I will have to see the movie again to get the full effect.I'm giving the movie 5 stars because it was very good and it's a fitting end to my favorite films of all time. The film delivers though I wished the movie had allowed us the audience to take a deep breath at certain scenes and allow things to soak in.So the rushed feeling will turn some people off, others it will not. So go and stand in a long line for a couple of hours this weekend and enjoy a film that you just don't get to see on a regular basis. This is the last SW film and it goes out with a bang.	5.0	Like Most SW movies you have to see it more than once	2005-05-19	5	4	1

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3HB6B10SCVD42	Smart Reader	"This movie could have been better, and this is what I mean:  The beginning outer space fighting scene looked like a video game made for ten year olds.  It was very unrealistic and very much an over kill. The following scene had Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi trying to rescue the Chancellor Palpatine who is in the main battle ship. Again, this whole scene was unrealistic because all of the stunts performed by Anakin and Obi-Wan were so outlandish that only Batman or Superman could have performed them.  This type of performance was never witnessed in the original Star Wars.  George Lucas really screwed up by making these incredibly unrealistic and unbelievable scenes.I also found several scenes in this movie to be depressing. For example when a lot of the Jedi are killed and then what happens to Padme.Also, after watching this movie I am surprised that it was allowed to have a PG-13 rating.  I beleive that this movie should be rated ""R"" because of a very violent and disturbing scene at the end of the movie when Anakin Skywalker loses one of his arms, his legs, and is completely burned up. This scene was too much. However, if you are a Star Wars fan, then I recommend seeing the movie because it shows how the Republic takes over, and how Anakin becomes Darf Vader."	4.0	Could have been better	2005-05-30	6	2	4

McIntyre	"This creation is by far the best of Lucas efforts when simply considering the latest trilogy of Star Wars.  This film does not however (for those expecting more) approach the wonderment of the original trilogy.The charaters continue to be ""narrated"" to us rather than acted.  The viewer really has to strech his/her imagination in order to create any bond with any of these characters.  The acting is rather poor in almost every case (some worse than others), and character depth seems to have alluded us once again.  The film is ripe with action however and that action is quite fantastic.Lucas also jams in, through the course of this film, most of the ""answers"" to the probing questions most of us had (and creates a few new ones).  Be warned the ""answers"" may be disappoint however.  The answer to the question as to why the fall to the dark side can perhaps change your past imaginations as to the strengths and character of Darth Vader. I wont go into that however in that it may spoil it for some, except to say that it did disappoint me and a few others (acknowledging that it is not ""our"" story but is Lucas's story).The past ""sillinesses"" that were present in part I and II are lacking here for the most part and that alone makes this a much better film.  Gone are the cuddly Barney like characters. Gone is flagrant and silly humor that appeared in I and II at the most inappropriate times (well this one is better in that regard anyways).In short, the Lucas vision and imagination (having seen it before my eyes) is not what it once was (perhaps not even close), but all in all it was good that Lucas played it out.  (Although I could have completely done without Episode I altogether :)"	4.0	Much better than I and II (but far short of the old tomes)	2005-05-23	3	1	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3V43IU15LA3HA	snow47	"Edit: Just to add a thought to this review - this is the only one of the Star Wars prequels that you need to see. If you have friends who've never watched Star Wars (surprisingly, there are people like that out there) or kids that you are just introducing to the saga, my recommendation is that you watch the original trilogy first. Then, watch Revenge of the Sith with the understanding that it is essentially a different filmmaker (i.e. still George Lucas, but in an different headspace) creating a prequel to a classic trilogy. This film has some tonal differences, but it's an exciting setup that is actually *much better* AFTER you have watched A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.The idea of watching all six Star Wars films in sequence sounds fun, but from my subjective perspective, it's not the best plan. Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones are weak films, and unless you are a completest, unnecessary. Of course, many will disagree with that assertion, but I'll stand by it. Best to approach the saga with the mystique generated by A New Hope, and gradually work back around to Revenge of the Sith, which fills in a lot of the crucial blanks and does bring you full circle in a mostly satisfying way. [/End of Edit]As a long-time Star Wars fan, and to clarify: someone who did not really enjoy episodes I or II, watching episode III was one of the most dramatically thrilling film experiences that I have ever had. Tons of action and fast-moving storylines, juxtaposed with the agonizing slow-motion of Anakin's internal turning point. The weight of the Jedi Council's realization that Palpatine is the Sith Lord that they have been trying to identify, and that he has been pulling the strings the whole time to manipulate the entire scope of galactic politics, is tremendously heavy. It gave me goosebumps to watch this for the first time, even already knowing basically what was to happen. The anticipation of which moment would be *the one* had me on the edge of my seat. Seriously. This film is pretty dark at times; there is almost nothing comparable, in even small doses, in any of the other five films. That is worth taking into account, and I would not fault anyone (especially parents of small children, but adults as well) for not wanting to watch certain scenes.I only gave this four stars because there is still a little of the cartoonish CGI that we saw so much of in episodes I and II. However, only a little of that shows up here, and the special effects are generally both (a) pretty good, realistic, and appropriately stylized, and (b) serve the story rather than taking away from it. The special features are very good (what?) and the inclusion of the deleted scenes is very much appreciated. They deal with, among other things, the formation of the eventual Rebel Alliance (including Mon Mothma! Oh that she had more screen time here!) and Yoda's exile on Dagobah. Completely relevant scenes, but I understand that there just was not room for them. Episode III has so much going on that it had to concentrate on Anakin, but it could have easily been three or four hours long based on all of the concurrent storylines.Again, I am not someone who just generically loves every Star Wars everything. I did not think that episodes I or II were very good, but this is a horse of a different color. I personally rank it at least the third best Star Wars film, and in terms of pure honest entertainment value (if not artistic merit), it might compete with the original Star Wars ""A New Hope"" film. Do not let your feelings about episodes I or II cause you to discount this without giving it a chance on its own merits."	4.0	Thrilling	2012-01-15	2	2	0
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A24PVVTV5PQKRM	Sonia Nat	"Well, on the plus side, its not boring and its certainly not as bad as ATTACK OF THE CLONES. There aren't as many mawkish love scenes or whining from 'Anni,' although there's still too much of that for the films own good. Christensen's performance has gone from terrible to annoying (he's bad, just in a different way), but then no-one is much good in the film. They're just there to link the computer effects sequences that Lucas is really interested in.  The film has a frantic pace which proves to frantic for subtlety, character or plot. Annakin's move to the Dark Side is never really that credible, just a plot point. He does it because if he didn't, he couldn't become Darth Vader. You won't be bored, but you also won't be convinced by the bits between the wildly overlong action scenes. Like RETURN OF THE JEDI, Lucas swamps the film with overkill. More lightsabre fights, bigger space battles, even more lightsabre fights, big stormtrooper battles, yet more lighsabre fights, and a lot less return on the investment. You get the picture. There's so much of it that by the time you get to the lightsabre fight that counts, your reaction is ""Not ANOTHER one?"" All in all watchable but also pretty forgettable. It's not a film you really need to see, but you probably won't mind it if you do. But that does seem to be an underwhelming verdict for something this anticipated."	5.0	It's all a bit average really	2008-09-02	1	0	1

If Lucas had just put everything into Episode III instead of trying to spread it out and milk more money out of loyal Star Wars fans, he could have just made a prequel, it would have been kick-ass, and he would be the god of movie-making. (Ok, he still is the god of movie-making, but he's now a lesser god because of those first 2 poopers.) In short, everything in the first two episodes could have been put into Episode III, and that one movie would have been better than the 3 combined were.And, seriously, can he not ask for help with the dialogue?

The effects are light years ahead of the original series, and ""Sith"" has a moving story and makes us care about the characters.  Lucas moves away, finally, from all the politics of ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones,"" and shows us what we have been waiting for--the fall of Anakin Skywalker to the dark side.Lucas does effectively link the new trilogy to the old in many of the scenes in the final moments of ""Sith.""  When I re-watched ""A New Hope"" (the first Star Wars film), I had a new understanding of the relationships between characters.  I did notice, however, that the technology in the Star Wars universe seems to take a major step backwards.  After all of the sophisticated attacks of the clone wars and R2-D2 flying around, in ""A New Hope"" we see primative-looking computer graphics during the attack run on the Death Star, and R2-D2 now has to be lifted into the cockpit by a crane.  But perhaps one could say that the Empire caused much of that(?).Other touches that irritated me earlier are Lucas's mirroring much of the dialogue and events of the original trilogy--such as, Obi-Wan says to Dooku in ""Clones,"" ""I'll never join you"" which echoes Luke telling Vader in ""Empire"" the same thing.  In ""Revenge of the Sith,"" Yoda makes an escape very similar to Luke's escape at the end of ""The Empire Strikes Back.""  But one echo I thought was apt was the event that defined Anakin's fall in ""Sith"" is similar to the event that saves him in ""Jedi.""Yes, much of the dialogue in ""Sith"" is flat, and some good performances could have been made great with better direction, but overall, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a satisfying Star Wars film and completes the saga of the Skywalkers.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2RKUQ8GTE8GT	Sparky	"Episode III is no doubt the best of the three prequels, but it still falls short of the original three.Revenge of the Sith completes Anakin's turn to the dark side of the force.  This one is dark--very dark--and that's what I love about it.  The story is much tighter than the first two and it's action packed.Unfortunately, it's downfalls are the same as the other two prequels... acting and too much animation.Half the time I don't know if I'm watching an real movie or an an animated movie.  It seems like 95 percent of the scenes are all computer animated, including the characters like all the storm troopers, Yoda, the Wookies, the spaceships, EVERYTHING.  What made the original three so great to me is that they didn't half all this technology.  They built the actual sets, they shot on actual locations like the desert and frozen north, they used actual people to play all the characters, they were real, life-like characters and scenes.  When you watch Episode III, you sit there and it's obvious it's all done in front of a blue screen...nothing is real and you simply don't get the same feel.  I can understand using computer animation for outerspace fighting scenes, but it's simply overkill.Which leads me to the other problem... acting.  Ian McDiarmid, I thought, was fantastic.  He was very convincing in his role as Palpatine, very much like the Emperor in Return of the Jedi.  But for the most part, just about everyone else is stiff as a board.  There's no emotion, there's no passion.  Go back and watch Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi.  There's so much chemistry between the cast.  Just watch them in their roles.  When Yoda preaches to Luke how you must ""feel the force"" in Empire, you as a viewer could feel how powerful of a statement that was, you could feel his passion.But for much of Revenge of the Sith, it's like watching cardboard cutouts, culminating in the worst of the worst when Anakin morphs into Vader and yells out, ""NOOOOOOO!"" while strapped to the table in a Frankenstein-like moment, followed closely by the birth of Luke and Leia (that scene was so cheesy).  I can't believe George Lucas scripted those scenes and thought they were good.Overall, if you go in with low expectations for acting, you'll enjoy this movie.  The wrap up the story of Anakin's turn to the dark side was pretty well done.  Lots of action with another great lightsabre showdown.  While not up to the standards of the original trilogy, it was close and ties up the loose ends."	4.0	Better than the first two	2005-11-02	7	4	3

I avoid conversations on the subject, don't know all the trivia and don't own the toys or costumes. I've just quietly loved these movies all my life. And...I love this movie. Did it have cheesy parts? Well, I don't know...is it a Star Wars film? If you're like me, you don't rate these movies on the same scale as others. There is a sentimentality to it like no other. You sort of turn off the skeptic and let yourself be taken. Revenge of the Sith has more of what made this series famous than any since The Empire Strikes Back...hands down. There's no question.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A29BQ6B90Y1R5F	S. Rhodes	"It's hard to actually want to see Star Wars Episode III.  Especially after all the mixed results from the previous two films.  The truth is, even if you don't want to see Star Wars Episode III, you're going to anyway!  No matter what you have to find out how Anakin becomes Darth Vader.  Even if you hated Episode I and II, you'll have to see this one just because it's impossible to go without knowing the entire story to the saga.The movie begins in the classic form.  The only form that has actually stayed classic.  We see the crawling text that talks about the events that have happened.  As the crawling text ends, we see one of the most steller space battles in Star Wars history.  The Chancellor has been kidnapped, and two Jedis have been dispatched to save him.  These two jedis are none other than Anakin Skywalker, and Obi-Wan Kenobi.After successfully landing on the sperialist ship, Anakin and Obi set out to rescue Palpatine.  After a showdown with Count Dooku, Anakin and Obi return to the Jedi Council.  Padme admits she's pregnant, and Palpatine is thankful to Anakin for saving his life (and so is Obi-Wan).Afterwards, Palpatine ask Anakin to be his personal body guard.  This doesn't settle with the Jedi council at all, and even though Anakin has acheived a high honor at a very young age, they refuse to name him a jedi master.  Shades of the darkside are already coming onto Anakin because of this.Meanwhile, General Grievous and his droid army are moving their star fleet across the galaxy.  They move through the wookie home planet, and manage to hold an entire system hostage.  The jedi council must act.  Anakin thinks he's up to the task to stop Grievous, but the council entrusts the objective to Obi-Wan.  Not only that, but because Anakin is confused, they don't trust his judgement.Anakin is plauged by a premonition of Padme's death, and it only further confuses him.  When Palpatine finally confronts him to say he has the ability to stop death from happening, Anakin is all ears.  Further more, Palpatine goes on to share his wisdom of the Dark Side of the force.  Anakin now figures out Palpatine's little secret (and YOU, reading this review, should've figured it out from way back to Episode I).Anakin rushes to tell the jedi council, and Master Windu steps in.  In a final confrontation for the fate of the galaxy, Anakin must choose.  Either assist Mace Windu in taking out Palpatine, or assist Palpatine in taking out Mace Windu.In the end, we all know his decision, and we all also know that this is the darkest film in the Star Wars saga.  There are a few emotional parts, and it seems that some of the bigger problems from the previous two films are dealth with.  For one, Jar Jar doesn't say a word in this movie, and he is only on camara for about five seconds throughout the entire two hour and twenty minute ordeal.Hayden Christensen has certainly improved his acting after the previous film.  Anakin is more believeable, and when he is ultimately seduced by the darkside, his attitude shows it.  Likewise, the love story isn't as mushy and cheesy.There are still a few problems.  Some dialogue is pretty corny.  Nothing quite as bad as the dialogue we saw in ""Attack of the Clones"", but we have old cliche lines, such as when Obi-Wan tells Yoda, ""Anakin is like my brother"" and the like.Likewise, while the acting is much better, it takes a moment for the real emotions of the characters to come out.  Until the final showdown between Obi-Wan and Anakin, they're almost devoid of emotion on any situation.There were a few other disappointments.  For one, if you didn't watch ""Star Wars Clone Wars"" on Cartoon Network, it's almost impossible to see what Grievous's role in the film is.  Also, as cool as Grievous looks, his downfall is almost too easy.Not only that, but Lucas has stumped down to using nothing but CGI in parts where he shouldn't have too.  Is it really that hard to get extras for a ""Star Wars"" movie?  Almost all the clone soilders are computer animated.  Some parts you do need CGI, but if Peter Jackson could get thousands of extras to play the soilders in Lord of the Rings, how could it be so hard for Lucas?I was also disappointed by Chewbacca's appearance.  It seemed like he was thrown in there.  Really, Lucas must've been making this one up as he was going along.But there are a lot of things that make up for some of the cons, in large folds too.  We get to see Yoda do a lot more than in Attack of the Clones, including a showdown with the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious.Not only is Yoda's role incredible, but the showdown between Obi-Wan and Anakin in the end is equally impressive.  The movie has a lot of emotion at this point, and the acting done by Christensen hits incredibly high.However, within the last few minutes of the film, it seems that Lucas only threw in a bunch of cheap shots to better explain some of what happens in Episode IV.  Out of nowhere, and without reason, it is announced that C-3PO's memory must be wiped (and he didn't really do anything in this film), and somehow at the very last minute, Yoda discovers a way for Obi-Wan to talk to people through death.  A little Deus Ex Machina.Is Star Wars Episode III a good film?  Yes.  Is it the best of the new trilogy?  Yes.  But it's only good because it ties in fairly well with Episode IV, and it's only the best of this trilogy because Episode I and Episode II, for many people, was a letdown.Any Star Wars fan owes it to himself to see this one.  It doesn't matter if you liked the first two or not, you know you can't go without knowing how it all came to be.It is a fitting end, but not without some disappointment.  It fixes some problems in the last two, but in the process it somehow managed to create more problems.  Go see this, just to see how it turns out.  If you like it, save up for DVD.  If not, well, at least you know the saga from beginning to end."	3.0	It's decent, much better than the other two before it 3.5/5	2005-05-19	7	6	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1MTPO0O59D94O	S. Rosenbaum	"In some ways, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is better than all the other movies in the series.  But, at the same time, it has character problems which keep it out of the league of the original trilogy.First, what's good about it.  I agree with ""Washington Post"" critic Steven Hunter's view that the movie successfully answers the age old question of ""what makes man evil.""  The process of Anakin's turn to the Dark Side is not simplistic.  It's complex and layered.  And Hayden Christensen's performance, although not great, is better than it was in ""Attack of the Clones.""  There's also a tragic plot twist, which I won't give away, but people might guess, since it's something very common in science fiction.  Think ""Outer Limits.""Two performances steal the movie.  One is Ian McDiarmid as Chancellor Palpatine and you know who.  The other is the combination of Frank Oz's voice with the computer generated image of Yoda.  I think it's the best performance yet by an entirely digital character in a movie.  (I'm not counting Gollum in LOTR, becuase that was based on a real actor's movements.)  And Christopher Lee, although having only one scene, makes the most of it.  They say a picture is worth a thousand words.  Notice the look on Lee's face in his final moment.  Other actors don't fare so well, and the same pattern that existed in ""Clones"" applies here, although to a lesser extent.  When it comes to acting in front of blue screens, with everything around them to be added later, British actors do a lot better than American actors.I also feel vindicated in my political interpretation of ""Attack of the Clones,"" which almost no one else got, because almost everyone is getting it from ""Revenge of the Sith.""  Lucas may have decided that being subtle didn't work, so this time he hits the audience over the head with lines like, ""So this is how liberty dies, to thunderous applause."" and this exchange -- Anakin: ""If you're not with me, then you are my enemy!""  Obi-Wan: ""Only a Sith deals in absolutes!""Now, here are the problems.  First, as I said, some performances are better than others.  Secondly, and this a BIG problem, is Natalie Portman's role, or lack thereof.  Except for one, very powerful, heartbreaking scene, she doesn't get to do much of anything in the movie but stand around and worry.  Unlike Princess Leia who evolved over her three films, Padme Amidala has devolved.  She had a non-traditional role (two actually) in ""The Phantom Menace,"" and was one of the best things in it.  She had a semi-traditional role in ""Attack of the Clones.""  Now, in ""Revenge of the Sith,"" she has a completely traditional role.  Maybe Padme's devolution from a strong to a weak character is supposed to parallel Anakin's devolution from a good kid to an evil Sith.  But, if so, there are more dramatically exciting ways for a character to disintegrate.Here's something I wanted to see in the movie but didn't.  It has to do with Padme's line, quoted above, which is getting lots of press.  She says it quietly to Jimmy Smits.  I wanted her to shout it at the top of her voice in a last-ditch, futile attempt to save the Senate and the Republic from Palpatine's imperial proclamations.  Maybe that wouldn't be wise, from a self-preservation point of view, but if she were emotionally unhinged from the way Anakin has been behaving, then an act of desperation might be what she would do about it.  The most likely outcome would be that the Senate would throw her out -- literally.  (Palpatine would not have her killed, only because that wouldn't sit well with his protege Anakin/Vader.)  Then, with Padme's  world falling apart around her and her political life destroyed, the impact on the scenes which follow would make them even more tragic and heartbreaking than they are already.I haven't written about the action or the special effects, because they're being spectacular is a given.  Same for the music by John Williams, which plays better in the movie than on the soundtrack album."	3.0	A major character is not given her due.	2005-05-21	9	5	4

The effects are grand,  but too grand.  The scenes are NOT believable at all.  I found myself yawning and awaiting my exit.  Don't bother with this DVD.  The ""EXTRAS"" are not worthy of the cash.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2VUOO5RVB78A7	Stephanie Sandlin	Episode III Revenge of the Sith.I remember well as do most of us the hype building up to this movie's theatrical debut. I for one never saw it in the threatre. I waited until I could procure it on DVD.The acting is well mentioned as a source of flaws. Hayden Christensen tries. Something just doesn't click with the performance though. Its almost as if Anakin is two dimensional. The character doesn't make the full trek to being a believable human being. Also, I have a hard time believing Anakin could succumb to the darkside so easily. After Windu's death, Anakin knew he'd really screwed up, but went with Sidious anyway. Hmm... just doesn't cut it.Natalie Portman is reduced to pretty much cameos. Which is a good thing. She doesn't impress me as an actress. She's far to stiff and doesn't grow. She's another two dimensional character who feels more like a plot device. She doesn't sell herself in this role, nor has she sold herself in any role I've seen her.There are some highlights of the acting. Ewan McGregor possibly puts on the darkhorse performance of the film. He is steady, believable as Ben Kenobi. He makes you believe that the world is collasping around him. If Ewan weren't in this, I shudder to think how bad it could've been.Many people site Ian McDiarmid as putting on THE performance of the film. I disagree to that. In the beginning as the Chancellor, ok I'll go along with that. Once he reveals himself as Sidious he falls into camp. Especially some of the quips as Yoda and he are fighting. I think I liked the cool, arrogant stylings of Sidous as opposed to the mouthy over the topness.The story. Its all about Anakin's fall to the darkside. Everything is based on visions of Padme's death during childbirth. Which causes our mechanical armed protagonist great problems. Which gives Sidious an in and twists Anakin's mind thus bringing him to the darkside.I really have a problem with the plotline. Its hard for me to believe Anakin could be so stupid as to let himself be used. I know Palpatine/Sidious was smart how he played Anakin. But still, after he revealed himself to Anakin that should've stopped that one cold. Also, why didn't Anakin take Padme's plea to leave and return to Naboo and get out of this mess? Point here - its not believable. At least to me. When you are starting a family many things in life become secondary.Lastly, and this is the final nail in the coffin for me. Its a fargin' CG fest. Call me old school, call me unhip, call me what you want. I just cannot get into movies that have a complete and total reliance on CG. In the first trilogy it was done the old school way which looked real. Lucas' reliance on computers now, while state of the art looks phony. It looks like a video game to me. Thus, its lost its sense of tangibility.In the final view, the prequels (although III does the best - I was awful, II was a bit better) do not hold up nearly as well original trilogy. The acting chops, the casting, the story and the over reliance on CG just never allow you to be fully drawn in. Its like watching people on a playstation 2.	3.0	Great? No. Good? Naw. Ok?

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3I69IXPTDVKQF	Stephen B. O'Blenis	"The Star Wars movie saga has come to an end (for now, at least) but in a totally unexpected way and in a movie quite far removed from the tone of the first five entries.  Of course, it was going to be darker than previous entries; pretty well everything in Episodes 1 & 2 was building up directly or indirectly to an apocalyptic collision of forces.  And of course, we knew from Episodes 4 through 6 that Episode III was going to be the dawn of the empire.But this goes beyond anything that that would have indicated.  ""Revenge Of The Sith"" is Star Wars done as a horror movie, dark, intense and with all the grand obsidian awe associated with such great horror as ""Hellraiser"" or ""Dagon"".  It's still high-octane, high-adventure science fiction at its best, and fits nicely with the rest of the saga (actually, it's the Only way that the spirit of the originals and the spirit of the prequels could be fully tied in together) but in making itself as much a horror movie as anything, just as ""Attack Of The Clones"" successfully made itself an epic love story as much as anything, it takes ground that had only been hinted at in the previous chapters and breaks it wide open in the most dramatic and shocking fashion possible.I've written in my reviews for ""Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack Of The Clones"" my disappointment with, and later acceptance of, the vast differences between the Jedi Order and the Old Republic we see in the prequels and that which in the original trilogy we were led to believe existed before the Empire.  Here, all the pretence is pretty much blown away.  There are the evil, there are the in-between, but conspicuosly absent is the third level: there are almost no pure 'good guys' in the movie.  This clearer representation of the picture of the pre-Empire galaxy ironically comes as Obi-Wan Kenobi, and later Yoda, seem to be coming somewhat closer to their original selves as seen in ""Star Wars"", ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return Of The Jedi"" and having second thoughts about the hard, emotionally cold and insular course the Jedi have apparantly been taking since years before Episode 1, but it comes too little, far too late.This is the most horrifically tragic movie I have ever seen; some movies are beautifully tragic (""Titanic""), others depressingly tragic (the brilliant but pretty darn downing ""Waking The Dead""), and some manage that elusive but incredibly powerful mix of tragedy with triumph (""Simon Birch""); this is tragic in the bloodfreezing horror that comes to be unleashed.  To this day, I feel myself go icy thinking about the final thirty minutes, an ending to the movie that's a captivating nightmare.  And a nightmare totally avoidable; the deep irony being that if the Jedi had really been as noble and wise as the first trilogy alluded they'd always been, the Emperor almost certainly would never have been able to turn Annakin to the Dark Side and the Empire would never have existed.  There is shock after shock in the final going which I hope people will refrain from mentioning specifically for the benefit of those who haven't seen the movie yet, but I will make mention of one, nonspecific shocker.  Just when you think you've seen it all, and that a true force of genuine 'good guys' is rallying up, one of them who came off so well goes and does something so shockingly unexpected and in such a casual manner that it hits the viewer with a whole new jolt just when you've started to recover.The original trilogy could be summed up as the story of the Rebellion Vs. the Empire, while this could potentially be summed up as the story of Padme (one of the few characters who through all of ""Revenge Of The Sith"" continues to come off exceptionally well and Good) and Annakin.  There's really no way this could have ended brightly, so end dark it does, and as one of the most mesmerising movies in history.I see this isn't coming out as extended, despite rumors that it would.  One report claimed that the original cut of the movie was something like six hours long and that the violence was actually drastically Reduced for the theatrical release.  I would absolutely love to see the full extended version someday.  There comes a point about ten or fifteen minutes before the end, from which ""Revenge Of The Sith"" REALLY should have gone for At Least another hour or more; some of the first half's going also seemed kind of rushed.  And if they're going to bring out a longer, presumably R-level version, then maybe (and it's totally out of character for me to say this, hating censorship and the editing down of movies as much as I do) but perhaps, since this Is Star Wars, they should do a modified PG cut too.  I mean, I'm not saying this isn't suitable for eleven-and-twelve year-olds and so on, but the little tykes - the 5 and 6 year olds - are going to want to see this too, and in my opinion this is more violent and far, far more disturbing than R-rated fare like ""RoboCop"", ""Flatliners"" and ""Terminator 2"".  It feels surreal to talk about bringing out a toned down version of any movie (most of the time I don't think we should even Have official ratings systems, just general guidelines for the parents of the very young, and I think everything about movies 'causing' real-life bad behavior is just convenient scapegoating (just look through a history book and see what humans have done to one another since long before there were movies or even written language), but as for nightmares and scares and the like, if you're going to let the wee ones watch this version, you should probably watch it with them, all gathered on the sofa, for potential support.A few final thoughts: possibly the best special effects ever, allowing the most exotic and grandiose of concepts to be played out on screen in perfect realism; the best acting of the prequels; Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine deserves an Oscar nomination at least but almost certainly won't get one; tons of enigmatic questions to ponder and debate between yourself and your friends and loved ones regarding such characters as Palpatine, Mace Windu, R2-D2(!), General Grievous, etc. that can't be mentioned here for fear of giving critical elements away; the light saber battles are among the most jawdropping battle sequences ever, and I feel my suspicion that the Jedi Council were as responsible as Palpatine for the terrible dawn of Darth Vader, more terrifying here than in the first trilogy many times over, have been borne out.  An incredibly multi-faceted movie that'll stay with you forever, regardless of whether there's eventually an Episode 7 or (as the door was left open for?) a pre-Episode 1 installment.Fantastic and unexpectedly fearsome; on a quality par with Any previous Star Wars chapter."	5.0	"""Rise....."""	2005-08-10	4	3	1

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AW2TNV5R8E67E	"Stephen F. Selby ""Simsbury CT Reviewer"""	"George Lucas has been plain in his goal. He has brought back a genre - the Saturday serial. There was a time, before TV was common, when the kids would all run down to the local movie theatre to see what happens next to Flash Gordon, or The Batman, or any other number of stories told by installment. These movies are not high art, they are pop-art. And no-one beats George Lucas in pop-art. What most reviewers fail to cover are two important points:1) The style of the Star Wars movies, including acting, transitions (wipes / dissolves, etc) are all reminiscient of the pop-serials of the 1940s and 1950s. If you dont like the acting, you have missed the point. I will explain more below. The Star Wars movies are intended to pay homage to an old style of movie making. I ask you to consider Lucas's ""American Graffiti,"" which was an idealized look back at cruising culture in California. george Lucas likes to look back and make the old new.2. Revenge of the Sith (ROTS) shows us the last piece in a part art puzzle. The story arc is the fall and redemption of Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader.Acting: the acting is not what the audience expects out of today's post-method crowd. We used to seeing a realistic portrayal of acting and not used to other styles. George Lucas is too smart NOT to have gotten the shots he wanted, and too successful not to have gotten the actors he wanted.Special Effects: Ray Harryhausen eat your heart out.Story line: Star Wars is a storyline driven arch. It is not dialogue driven. The whole point is for the audience to wonder ""what happens next?"" And we did, for all 5 sequels didn't we?Dialogue: Go back and watch the old serials. Carrie Fisher once quipped ""Who talks like that?"" when discussing a line from A New Hope. Princess Leia to Governor Tarkin ""I should have recognized your foul stench..."" No-talks like that, except in 1940s and 1950s style serials. Granted the dialogue could be better, but Lucas was not far off the mark for his chosen genre.A theory on Episodes 1, 2, and 3:Episode 1: The primary criticism is that Phantom Menace is a kids movie. Well, yeah. Anakin is a kid. He reacts like a kid, talks like a kid, acts like a kid! Phantom Menace in a sense, is a kids movie. The whole structure of the movie reflects the primary character. Jack Lloyd was a refreshing change from the over prepared, over polished child actors of our time. I believed in Anakin as a child, not as a prodigy.Episode 2: The fast past and frenetic action are reminiscient of a teen aged mind. Attack of the Clones again reflects, through the action, the emotional depth of a teen-ager, but with power. Anakin is disturbing not because he feels pain, but because he is not really limited. Anakin is dangerous because he is a typical teen-ager who lacks perspective and has a limited world view. He is anger without greater emotional context. The producers noted that they wanted a James Dean like quality. It seems that Lucas did his job well.Episode 3: Anakin's emotional maturity has reached its peak, as has the third installment. We know have to deal with a person in control of his emotions, but is not experienced enough to avoid being manipulated. Is Anakin evil or tragic? Both points can be argued. He is not a synmpathetic character in this movie. The slaughter of the Jedit younglings contrasts with the slaughter of the sand people in Episode 2. Killing sand people was about anger and revenge. The killing of Jedi in Episode III is a Machiavellian power grab. Anakin is scary because he thinks his way is the only way and everyone who stands in the way of his vision will die.I think the movies parallel the development of the character of Anakin in Episodes 1-3.George Lucas is a master movie maker. The only real debate is not whether or not the acting, dialogue, etc, are up to modern notions of movie making. The real question is whether George Lucas successfully paid homage to the serial format. Take a look at old Flash Gordon and other 1930's era sci-fi serials to see what I mean.Why is this series enduring? Look at the fourth disk in the recent release of episodes 4-6. Lucas was a ""student"" of Joseph Campbell. The stories touch something primal in the human psyche. In this sense, the Star Wars movies are a triumph of substance over style. We love the movies with little real regard for their ""flaws,"" which I believe are really stylistic choices.If you are fan of myth and science fiction, Star Wars is kings.PG-13 for very disturbing images of murder and mayhem. Gruesome killing and maiming."	4.0	Sith - Putting the Fun Back in Movies	2005-10-10	6	3	3

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AT07UZQQR7ZEH	"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov..."	"STAR WARS: CHAPTER 3-REVENGE OF THE SITH just might be my personal favorite of the six STAR WARS movies.  It has a very strong screenplay by George Lucas to compliment world-class sound design by my college best friend Ben Burtt and the expected stupendous visual effects and magnificent John Williams score.  It, quite simply, has everything that one could ask of a STAR WARS film, and then some.  It makes me feel like a kid again.  Several thousand Lucas employees are all working to capacity and beyond.  SITH is an adventure masterpiece.The first thing you notice, even with just stereo headphones and a 27"" television in a bedroom, is the overpowering THX soundtrack and wondrous music.  They come roaring at you and surround you like overwhelming jet engines.  Then you notice the unusually rich color and super-clear images.  I am told that SITH was shot in a different format, high definition digital or something.  I have no idea what that means, but remember seeing the movie in a theater with that same format and noticing unusually clear images and vibrant color.  So Lucas and company must be on to something when the results are tremendous even on a small TV in a bedroom.This is the longest STAR WARS movie, at 140 minutes.  But editors Ben Burtt and Roger Barton keep it well paced, engrossing, and exciting.  And Lucas gives it a powerful script.  So much happens here, especially Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) becoming Darth Vader, the birth of Luke and Leia at the end, and the fate of Amadala (Natalie Portman) and Count Dooku (Christopher Lee).  Anakin will give up his princess to embrace the dark side, and that packs a dramatic wallop I am not used to in even the best STAR WARS film.  This is a very dark and gripping movie, worthy of a PG-13 rating. Disk 1 of the widescreen double DVD has optional audio commentary by writer/director Lucas, producer Rick McCallum, production designer Gavin Bouquet, animation director Ron Coleman, and visual effects suupervisors whose insights all enhance the movie we are watching.The disk 2 DVD seems to go to infinity.  First are 15 mini documentaries, about five minutes each, that include such areas as creature creation, makeup, music (John Williams is justifiably proud of having scored all six movies), costumes, stunts with ace stunt coordinator Nick Gillard, sound with my buddy Ben, shooting on digital tape, animation, and even the essential catering for hundreds of hungry craft workers and extras.Then there are five or six Deleted Scenes, hosted by writer/director Lucas and producer McCallum.  These are very good scenes that just run too long, slow the movie down, or refocus it, like several with Senator Padme that give her too much emphasis at that point in the story.Finally, there are three major documentaries: (1) 15 minutes on the film's stunts with Nick Gillard doing such a good job as fight arranger that Christensen and Ewan McGregor (Obi-wan Kenobi) wanted to do most of their own light saber stunts.  (2) ""The Chosen One""-30 minutes, which has George Lucas focusing on Darth Vader over six films.  Darth Vader is a very serious and tragic character, a villain who becomes a redemptive victim.  Does Anakin want to marry the lovely Padme or face his responsibility as a Jedi Knight?  Anakin, then Darth Vader, is a good man who decides to embrace his evil nature, which makes a powerful conflict.  This is one reason why I favor this STAR WARS chapter the most.  And am I the only one who, at the end of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (Chapter 5) or RETURN OF THE JEDI (Chapter 6), when Darth Vader is finally unmasked as a harmless little man, is reminded of The Wizard of Oz (Frank Morgan) unmasked near the end of THE WIZARD OF OZ?  Was that intended?And (3) the crown jewel of disk 2 is a huge 90 minute feature documentary that goes into microscopic detail on how just one minute of the movie was made, from screenplay to finished film.  The documentary is called ""Within a Minute"", if you are trying to locate it on your disk two.  The scene is a fabulous one, Anakin and Obi Wan having a light saber duel in a volcano called Mustafer (really Mount Etna in Italy when everyone got lucky from a real volcano erupting) full of brilliant orange lava.  We start with Lucas' script, which will change a lot because Lucas believes that the movie is ""made in the editing room.""  Each of two dozen craft areas have as many as six hundred workers, each with one specific task in the total jigsaw puzzle picture.  Included are construction, props, makeup, costumes, and catering for several thousand people all over the world.  80 people worked on just costumes, under Trisha Biggars.  Nick Gillard worked with the actors on stunts, especially light saber duels which required several types, sizes, and weight swords.  The fights for this lava field fight were apparently done in front of what is called a ""green screen"", with the lava added as spectacular visual effects; the two must be perfectly coordinated, along with cinematographer David Tattersall's exquisite widescreen cinematography.  There are three different camera operators, working with pioneering high definition digital tape, which everyone seems very impressed with in terms of both quality and final result time.  There are also dozens of electricians (gaffers).Ben Burtt is the renowned and Oscar-winning sound designer again, supervising both dialogue recorded on the set and sound effects in post production, then blending everything perfectly with John Williams' lush music (one of his greatest scores) and what is called foley (sound effects, like doors opening and footsteps).  It was apparently a mammoth editing job, eighteen months on two continents.  Editors Burtt in Marin County (California) and Roger Barton in Sydney (Australia) had a herculean, if labor of love job.  Remember again that Lucas likes ""making the movie in the editing room,"" not surprising for a movie that will combine live action, animation, green screen, and computer graphics.  Every single detail must blend perfectly.  The audience might not notice an extra detail, but will definitely notice a flaw on a big theater screen.  And re-recording will be done in London, where Williams will work on the almost non-stop music score.Now Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) in Marin County comes into play with 150 people.  Several departments, each with their separate crews, will add the volcano effects to the green screen fight shot with actors Christensen and McGregor.  But this is one of only something like 2100 separate shots, each of which has animation (supervisor Ron Coleman is one of the disk one audio commentators), computer graphics, and models.  Rotoscoping and compositing next come into play-matte paintings (essentially painted backdrops that alter reality) and painting to combine everything flawlessly on a visual level.  Ben and his re-recording mixers make sure the entire audio for each scene blends perfectly in itself and with the visuals.  Sound mixing has to do with what track in a scene-dialogue or music or effects-will dominate and to what degree.Finally, we have a finished film that hopefully is ready for unveiling to the public.  The result for most of the critics I've read is that SITH is the best of the first three movies, meaning chapters 1 - 3.  No one seems willing to suggest, as I am, that just maybe it is even better than chapters 4 - 6 from two decades ago.  And why not?  After all, SITH has a knockout soundtrack, brilliantly rich and clear photography, fabulous music, and a very dramatic and powerful screenplay.  25 years of technological advancements have gone into it.  Once again, so help me, REVENGE OF THE SITH is my favorite STAR WARS film.  Everyone who worked on it, down to the lowliest laborer, can be very proud of his or her job.  This is a majestic and unforgettable work of art and labor of love.  And do see it on home video in widescreen format.And what a thrill it is to now finally have the entire STAR WARS sextette finished and available on a DVD bookshelf like a favorite friend to pull out and watch at whim, ideally over six consecutive nights.  Now maybe the enormously talented George Lucas can get his gang back together to make another AMERICAN GRAFFITI (1973).  Maybe he can do a change of pace adolescence drama or family human interest drama with my dear college friend Ben Burtt as sound designer and editor.  180 degrees different from STAR WARS.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AWGPEXO9M8R7Q	Stephen M. Sturgeon	"Okay, having read the book, the comic adaptation, played the video game on Gameboy from beginning to end...both Obi Wan and Anakin side, I more or less knew what to expect. I had very high expectations for this movie. It actually managed to meet up with them. There were a few problems with it.There were one or two places where the ""I love you"" talk between Ani and Padme get to be a tad trite. But Lucus does manage to bat it down before it gets overbearing like in Attack of the Clones. So that much I can forgive.The part where Bail Organa tells an orderly to wipe C-3PO's memory makes little sense. If you read the book, you see that it's because 3PO starts to blather about the stories he plans on telling Leia about her mother and father when she grows up. That's immediately followed by the mind wipe order. In the film it just comes out of no where.The part where Yoda tells Obi-Wan about QuiGon also seems to come out of no where without the previous seen of Yoda actually communing with QuiGon. Granted, it shows him meditating, but that doesn't really mean anything.It also lost most of the political intrigue. In the book it went into great depth about secret meetings between Bail, Padme and Mon Mothma. But given the break neck pace Lucas seemed to be trying to keep this at, it's understandable why he would settle on that as being less important.But other than these very few gripes, I have to say I absolutely loved this movie. I will have to see it again when I get the time. Obi-Wan Vs. Grievious, Obi-Wan Vs. Vader, Vader's annihilation of the Jedi Temple and the Seperatists, all of it was simply amazing. I think I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's possibly the best Star Wars movie.  It's certainly the most emotional of the six."	5.0	High Expectations Fully Met *possible spoilers*	2005-05-21	12	9	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2JFUCS7TM3HR8	Stephen R. Balzac	Seeing Revenge of the Sith is like going to a Hong Kong action flick: you don't go for the plot or the dialogue or the characterization; rather, you go for the martial arts.  Sith is just like that, only without the martial arts.The acting and dialogue in the movie continue to hold to the same high standards set in the two previous movies.  In other words, they make Plan 9 From Outer Space look good.  The only redeeming feature is that Jar-Jar doesn't get any lines.Yoda (played by Fozzie Bear) is, once again, the only well done character in the whole movie.  The battle between Yoda and Palpatine at least comes close to the action standards set by Kermit the Frog and Long John Silver in Muppet Treasure Island.We learn in Sith that although Jedi can sense fine gradations of emotion (e.g. fear), they can't sense strong emotions like the fact that the people around them are about the shoot them in the back.  I can only conclude that betrayal just isn't subtle enough to be sensed through the Force.  Nor, apparently, could Anakin sense that Padme was telling him the truth when she showed up on Mustafar.The only thing that makes any shred of sense is that the clone warriors can't succeed in killing Obi-Wan.  Once again, they miss him.  This is not suprising as we know from the last movie that the template for the clones was Jenga Fett.  Jenga Fett couldn't manage to hit Obi-Wan with weapons ranging from a hand blaster to a star fighter blast cannon.  In at least one small way, Lucas managed to live up to the Chekovian ideal that if you want to use a gun in act three, you must put it on the wall in act one.As far as Anakin's switch to the Dark Side, for all the emotion he showed, he might have been ordering chocolate ice-cream instead of vanilla. Perhaps that's the true difference between the light side and dark sides of the Force?Finally, the dramatic battle between Obi-Wan and Darth/Anakin ended up feeling like something out of the Naked Gun: villain falls off the ledge, gets run over by a steamroller, walked across by the marching band, etc.  That's not quite what happened to Anakin (there was no steamroller), but otherwise there wasn't much difference.All in all, a great way to cure insomnia (my wife kept dozing off throughout the flick).Ultimately, Sith is a tragedy.  Unfortunately, I don't think it's in quite the way that George Lucas intended.	1.0	Lucas does it again... unfortunately	2005-06-05	99	41	58

Lucasfilm and LucasArts used to be the pinnacle of special effects; no more! Weta Workshop's work on the Lord of the Rings trilogy totally dwarfs this. Probably because they used alot of well costumed actors, not to mention their excrutiating attention to detail. Star Wars has lost the magic it once had. I really wish Lucas didn't ""CG up"" the old trilogy dvds too, it really tarnishes them. Well, at least he can't ruin any more Star Wars movies.

There is practically nothing of C3-P0, little of R2D2, and Yoda doesn't have anything to do until the last quarter of the picture. The Friday matinee I attended was packed with small children, who had absolutely no interest in following the moral degeneration of Anakin Skywalker. They were too busy crawling over the seats and yelling ""Shoo! Shoo!"" with their imaginary lightsabers, or dragging their parents (I should say mommies) to the snack bar and the restroom.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AVAYPIMDXYNRF	Steve	How do I start?Star Wars III is like watching a three hour fireworks show. It's fun at first but soon one finds the explosions and bright colors an annoyance. They hope it will end soon. SW3 is the same. It offers such cutting edge FX that my eyes hurt. Does the future (or is it the past?) look so bright? I gotta get some shades then. Lucas overloaded this picture with so much razzle-dazzle he forgot he was in charge of a movie, not a magic show.The acting blows because the script blows, and Hayden's monotone just doesn't fit the personality of a man on the verge of becoming the devil. Actors zoom from locale to locale, meeting weird beasties and shiny bots, getting in fights and expressing their love without the slightest hint of story.Lucas never paced this series well at all and because of that he had to overload this last one to make up for it. The viewer never gets a nicely paced story showing Anakin's descent. Suddenly though, in SW3, Anakin throws his values aside and takes up the chancellor's cause for one reason: Lucas was out of time and had to force the transformation.And the fight between Anakin and Ben was horrible. Lucas saw that he had to explain how Darth Vader lost his hair, his legs, and got that scar on his head, so he had this terribly contrived and lengthy sequence showing how it happened. For God's sake, the viewer does not need to be hand held through the experience.SW3 puts the cap on a mediocre at best series. I can't bear to watch SW2. Actually SW1 is, despite Jar-Jar, the best because it has some spirit to it. Poor Lucas went insane on the last two and gave the viewers fireworks, not depth.	2.0	Revenge of Bad Film Making	2008-05-05	5	3	2

With this installment, Lucas returns to what made the original trilogy popular: great characters played by great actors (Yes, even Hayden Christensen does a fine job in ths film), set against a backdrop of Jedis, Wookies, and the ultimate fight between good and evil.With this final installment, Lucas has created the film that will bridge the prequels with the original trilogy. But the film is dark, darker than any of the previous films. It is also very depressing, as we see the rise of the evil Galactic Empire, and the rise of Darth Vader from what is left of Anakin Skywalker (In a sequence that gave the film it's much-deserved PG-13 rating). Not only that, but you will wish Anakin would die at the end of this film, even though we all know that doesn't happen until ""Return of the Jedi.""The acting is great, the storytelling as good as the original trilogy, and the lightsaber battles are the best that have ever been seen in a ""Star Wars"" film.

As the third part of a six part epic story, having to dove tail with the first Star Wars movie, which is the fourth part, maybe it was doomed from the get go.  It had to explain Luke and Leia, how ObiWan had Anikin's light saber, why Anikin wound up wearing the Darth Vadar suit, ObiWan's statement about hunting down and destroying the Jedi, yadda yadda yadda.  The big gap was Vadar's mentor.  Throughout the first three parts, we have no clue as to his past and never see him coming.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1FJFMX9S83298	Steven smith	There are a lot of negative things to be said about any given movie that has been released throughout history. But what makes a good movie, is if the good things about it, greatly outweigh the bad things about it. A bad movie is just the opposite; and I have seen some very poor movies. If I had a top five list of poor and pathetic movies, 'Revenge of the Sith' would undoubtedly and unfortunately be on that list. There are very few, if any real redeeming qualities about this movie. It isn't a classic... and can never be a classic. It has failed the fans of Star Wars (older fans of the O.T.), and the more intelligent fans. People who really liked and enjoyed this movie, are either in denial, or just plain simpletons.The story is lacking. The third edition to the saga needed to perhaps be the most powerful. This was the movie that was supposed to be better than any of the others; we were supposed to be moved to tears by the transformation that Anakin took from being himself, to becoming Darth Vader. I wasn't moved.Characters, were like cardboard cut-outs. There was nothing deep in their personality that made them believable; the whole while watching this movie, I KNEW without a doubt that these were actors saying lines that they had read from a script written by a cop-out director. They had little to work with; the only true emotional part was by Ewan McGregor, when Anakin was about to catch on fire by the lake of lava. Those lines he delivered were the only lines worth remembering and caring about. Rather than that, the dialogue in this movie will be forgotten as the decades slip by.Are there any good things about this movie at all? Sure. But very few. If you read some of the other HONEST reviews here, you will see that the flaws outweigh any redeeming qualities... and after watching this movie, you will find that George Lucas failed. He failed at pleasing the audience, and failed the entire Star Wars franchise.But are there good things about the actual DVD itself? The picture quality is 100% top-notch, and there are many bonus features, that even if you hated the movie, you will probably like watching. The features are comprehensive and very interesting.	1.0	Expectations were high. And fans were let down.	2006-07-23	19	11	8

The art of Ralph Mcquarrie is that which got George Lucas the approval to make Star wars at 20th Century Fox. His sketches and concept design was amazing, and his ideas include the appearances of Darth Vader, Chewbacca, R2D2 , C3PO etc. and also includes the real life characters of many of the actors. You all must have seen this on the DVD presentation.I think Episode 5 was the best Star Wars film ever.....the reason being it was directed by another genius named ""Irvin Kershner"".The movie had a romantic and/or a bonding of the characters throughout and,  the most wonderful twist which wasn't planned before making Episode 4 is that Vader was Luke's dad....(written by george) was just amazing. The music in the movie had a beautiful lush sounding score which gave a wonderful feeling of being there in a place which you haven't seen before. It was really like being in a new planet.The problem with George is that he always has an industrial touch to his movies. He is a great creator but a very bad presnter.The 3rd episode is the 2nd worst of the saga after episode 2.The movie needed a great story teller like Irvin Kershner. The movie wandered everywhere but lost it's charm because the director concentrated only on the technical details forgetting the main idea of  making the narration simple. When you tell a story to a kid, you have to make it simple and interesting so that you don't lose the attention of the kid. You have to enjoy telling the story. Just the set props and the Computer generated characters don't tell the story. You have to use these elements well enough to make the audience feel immersed in a new world like that of the episodes 4,5 and 6.George had used characters like chewbacca's dad and their village just for the sake of bringing them in the picture which wasn't neccesary.He could've used more of the movie's footage in useful things.The 2 reasons for the success of the original Star wars was Ralph Mcquarrie for his art and design and John Willams for the unimaginable music without which the movie would've been a failure.It's really a very sad ending for one of my favourite movies of all time.Thank you George for the technology, but still, you are not a good director."	2.0	The industrial version of Star Wars	2005-08-12	24	10	14
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2KVUYPLEW4LXT	"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time"""	"There are many people who remember the golden age of Sci-Fi and Fantasy movies that came in the late 70's and into the 80's. There was cheesy and rediculous dialog, over-the-top acting, and strange plots that left a smile on the face of many a fan as they drank up the special effects and smiled at the tried and true techniques that make comic books and RPGs fun. This is a movie for people like that.The original Star Wars (episode IV) had some great mythological/philosophical ideas, a great villain, and characters that were lovable and engaging. It was also very cheesy and silly. That's part of what made it great. A lot of people seem to have lost sight of that in the push for ever darker, more serious, more violent movies that cater to an increasingly battle-hardened group of youths who's attention span is barely long enough for a TV commerical. I for one miss the old days, and enjoyed this movie for what it is.Pretty much every problem with this film is from the man who dreamed it up. The dialog at times sinks below cheesy to just plain bad. The camera angles and dramatic moments are simply not used to the full. The actors are not pushed to give the performances that we deserve. In other words, Speilburg should have directed and someone else should have written the script (watch War of the Worlds and you'll see what a REAL director can do with a movie that could have been terrible).Yet, for all of that this movie manages to be quite entertaining. The visual eye candy continues to draw us in like moths to a flame, savoring every explosion and light-saber strike like teenagers playing Knights of the Old Republic or Jedi Academy (or one of those great space-combat sims that LucasArts used to push out by the dozen). There are giant space battles, enough boss fights to compete with a Final Fantasy game, and plenty of space-opera melodrama to be found.John Williams is showing a definite lack of inspiration, which may be because he's tired of Star Wars or simply because there isn't that much genuine emotional depth in the film to inspire him.The key players to a good job in their parts for the most part, but the actor who plays the future Emperor outdoes himself in every scene. In particular the scenes between him and Anakin are wonderful because we know that he is pure evil and manipulating the young jedi, but he is so persuasive it is all to easy to see how a lonely and confused youth could fall sway to his misleading advice. I got a wonderful kick out of watching the slow transformation of Palpatine, as he increasingly let his true personality show (knowing that the time to conceal himself is drawing to an end). When the jedi from the Council come to arrest him there is a wonderful moment where you catch the expression on his face and the emotion in his voice and you know what he's REALLY thinking is something like ""You have NO idea who you are dealing with..."" Not even Yoda is a match for his force abilites, and having NEVER seen Palpatine use a lightsaber in any other movie, when you finally see his fight with it for the first time and get a true glimpse of just how powerful he is, it is a wonderful fan moment.The action sequences could be said to be a mixed bag I suppose, but there are just SO MANY of them that you cannot help but impressed at SOME POINT. While the fight between Obi-Wan and Grievous left me cold (espcially after the 20th episode of the Clone War cartoons), and the fight between Anakin and Dooku was over way too fast, some of the fights nearly took my breath away (when Palpatine engaged the Masters from the council I think my jaw dropped). If you like light-saber fights there's definitely enough to go around in this picture.The whole fall of Anakin Skywalker perhaps could have been handled better (his internal struggle just doesn't cut it for me), but again the scenes between Palpatine and him are fantastic, and his moving over to Palatine's side provides the darkest moments of the film. When the new Empire turns on the jedi, some people are going to feel deeply distressed (the moment that nearly broke my heart was what appears to be a 12-year-old-jedi trying desperately to protect Senator Organa from Imperial troops only to be cut down). Due to these dark moments many a parent should give serious consideration to leaving the kiddies at home for this one (depending on their age and other factors).I think Episode 1 was just plain awful. Episode 2 was better, and had some fun moments and interesting plot and action sequences (particularly the end). Revenge of the Sith is one crazy dark messed up (cutting down jedi CHILDREN Master Skywalker?!), action packed roller-coaster of a ride that will be a lot of fun for those who loved the sci-fi films of the 80's, and will likely either turn off or disappoint people who grew up or became engrossed in the films of more recent times. For what it's worth, I still enjoyed this movie a lot. It's worth watching once just to see the docile Senator do away with the false front and show just what a scary guy he really can be."	3.0	Revenge of the Sci-Fi Cheese	2005-07-03	15	9	6
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2Q56KZT6WHIY7	Striker	"The saga is complete. What George Lucas began in 1977 as a little movie that took the box office by storm, he has completed in 2005 with the most heralded motion picture of the year. With the arrival of Revenge of the Sith, Lucas places the missing piece of the six-film arc that tells of the rise, fall, and redemption of Darth Vader. It's a rousing and tragic sendoff to a beloved franchise, and the best installment in the Star Wars series since 1980's The Empire Strikes Back. If this is to be the last big-screen installment of the space opera, Revenge of the Sith ushers things out on a high note. Those who have disparaged the previous two prequels (1999's The Phantom Menace and 2002's Attack of the Clones) will find few things to complain about this time around. Lucas has delivered the film that Star Wars fans have been yearning for.Revenge of the Sith exhibits its writer/director's strengths and weaknesses for all to see. Lucas, who can at best be described as a journeyman writer of dialogue, delivers plenty of clunky lines. And the romance between Padme (Natalie Portman) and Anakin (Hayden Christensen) is as forced here as it was in the previous installment, the sincere efforts of the actors notwithstanding. Nevertheless, although weak in specific areas of screenplay-writing, Lucas is a masterful storyteller. That aspect of his creativity is in evidence here as he spins a tale as compelling as any Greek or Shakespearean tragedy: a man who attains power only after sacrificing everything dear to him, including his soul. There is bitter irony in Anakin's situation: by embracing the dark side of the Force, he loses the very thing he seeks to protect.When it comes to technical wizardry, no one - not Peter Jackson, James Cameron, or Steven Spielberg - can top Lucas, who has been on the special effects cutting edge since he pioneered various techniques in Star Wars. From a purely visual standpoint, no movie to-date can equal Revenge of the Sith. Even the inconsequential background shots are eye-poppingly spectacular. As for the space battles... ""incredible"" doesn't begin to do them justice. They astound with their vividness and complexity.Revenge of the Sith doesn't really answer any questions, since we know the answers already. Anakin Skywalker is seduced to the dark side of the Force and becomes Darth Vader. Chancellor Palpatine is revealed to be Darth Sidious. The Jedi are annihilated. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda go into exile on different planets. The democratic Republic is devoured by the Empire. Instead of answers, what we gain from watching Revenge of the Sith is details. These events come to life and we are presented with the opportunity to understand the particulars of each event. The jigaw puzzle is complete. In the process, Vader has been humanized in a way that even the ending of Return of the Jedi was unable to accomplish. It will not be possible to watch the original trilogy in the same way again. Revenge of the Sith changes everything. It invests so much else in the light saber duel between Obi-Wan and Vader in A New Hope and shifts the dynamic surrounding the Emperor's attempted seduction of Luke in Return of the Jedi. It's during that titanic struggle that Anakin finally emerges as the Chosen One and returns balance to the Force.Revenge of the Sith opens with the kind of action/adventure derring-do that has characterized the previous five installments, and the prequels in particular. After the introductory crawl announces ""War!"", we accompany Anakin and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor, looking more like Alec Guiness than in either of his previous appearances in this role) on a rescue mission - to save a kidnapped Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and his ally, General Grevious, leader of the droid army. It's all a ruse, but our heroes don't know that at the time. We're treated to a spectacular light saber fight and some stunning space battle sequences before politics enter the fray and Anakin begins to inch closer to where he is receptive to Palpatine's hints that the dark side of the Force offers limitless power to those who learn how to use it.Secondary stories abound. Anakin's wife, Padme, is pregnant. The marriage is secret, because it is forbidden for Jedi to form permanent attachments. Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) does not trust Anakin. He believes the young man is too ambitious - an assessment with which Yoda (Frank Oz) agrees. And, as the Clone Wars approach their final battle, a pending betrayal lurks. Revenge of the Sith features two classic confrontations: Anakin against Obi-Wan and the Emperor against Yoda. Once again, Revenge of the Sith is not about answering questions or providing surprises, but of fulfilling expectations. We may know how the Anakin/Obi-Wan duel ends, but the thrill here is seeing how it plays out to get to that ending.It's necessary to say a word or two about Darth Vader. After all, Revenge of the Sith shows us the birth of one of the 20th century's most iconic villains. By avoiding excessive reverence, Lucas makes the first appearance of the black mask and costume a moment of profound sadness. In that moment, we aren't so much experiencing the emergence of Vader as we are seeing the final death throes of Anakin. And, while there's an admitted thrill to hearing the voice of James Earl Jones, the content of some of Jones' lines is unlike anything we have previously heard from the voice-box of Vader. Not all eyes will be dry by the end of Revenge of the Sith. It has an emotional kick that no Star Wars film other than The Empire Strikes Back has achieved.Revenge of the Sith contains several masterfully edited sequences. Near the end of the film, the two big battles - Anakin against Obi-Wan and the Emperor against Yoda - are brilliantly intercut. Lucas repeats the feat shortly thereafter with another example of parallel action. That second instance is particularly effective because it offers one of the film's most uncompromising emotional jolts. John Williams' score is nearly perfect, and contains more cues from the original trilogy than his work for either The Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones.One thing that will please fans is the comfort of the familiar. Lucas includes numerous links and connections to the 1977 feature (which is the next in the chronology). Padme wears Leia's bun-style hairdo. The one-man fighters resemble TIE fighters and X-wings, and the larger cruisers are rough-hewn Star Destroyers. Tarkin and Chewbacca make appearances. Obi-Wan uses the lightsaber he later wields against Vader on the Death Star. Scenes are set in the antiseptic white corridors of the rebel blockade runner. And the clone troopers look a lot like the storm troopers they will become. We haven't quite come full circle, but it's close.It has been said that George Lucas is not a great director of actors, yet Revenge of the Sith contains some fine performances. First and foremost is Hayden Christensen, who was maligned in some circles for his petulant interpretation of Anakin in the previous film. This time around, he essays his character as an introspective, tormented man torn between loyalty to his friends and his beliefs and an overwhelming desire to embrace power. Christensen is not daunted by the task of playing an increasingly twisted character, and he makes the transformation to Vader work.Also impressive is Ian McDiarmid, who never gets enough credit as the frighteningly evil Emperor. Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman are more solid than in previous films - they have grown into their roles. Portman, who occasionally seemed uncomfortable as Padme in Episodes I and II, is now at home in the role, even though her screen time in this installment is limited. And it's always nice to see old friends like Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), and Frank Oz. Jimmy Smits (as Senator Bail Organa) and Samuel L. Jackson have significant supporting roles.Revenge of the Sith starts out a little unfocused. While there's plenty of action in the first hour, the direction of the storyline is uncertain. By the time the film has reached its halfway point, however, and Anakin's moral compass has been shattered, the picture picks up a momentum that never flags. We are kept on the edge of our seats for over an hour. Those who doubt Lucas' ability as a filmmaker need only watch the second half of Revenge of the Sith to be convinced otherwise.The movie's tone grows grimmer as the film wears on. This is not a happy movie. Even the victories are tinged with bitterness. There is an element of catharsis at the end, but it's only a taste. Salvation is left for the next chapter. How many people, I wonder, will return from seeing Revenge of the Sith and immediately pop A New Hope into the DVD player. It's almost a necessity. Revenge of the Sith offers little in the way of optimism. I applaud Lucas for taking this route and having the courage to believe that Star Wars fans can accept all of this darkness."	5.0	Everything that has a beginning has an end....	2005-11-20	5	1	4
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1W3FS1C2H4RCV	stu	Revenge of the Sith is much more entertaining than the previous two installments of the series.  This is really not saying much, considering how god-awful they were.  Despite the epic battles and the impeccable effects, this episode still lacks something essential - something that the original movies had in abundance.  It lacks fun and it lacks heart.In particular, these new Star Wars movies are missing compelling, archetypal characters that connect with the viewer on a basic level.  There was Luke, the young ingenue, Obiwan, the sage, Lea, the spunky  heroine, Darth Vader, the uber-villian, and finally, Han Solo, the lone wolf anti-hero with a heart of gold.  I loved Star Wars because i loved the characters.  The new movies show that, without compelling characters, fantasy films become an excersize in tedium.Every character in the new trilogy is either stodgy and serious to a fault or a complete nitwit like Jar Jar Binks.  Compare Princess Amandala to Princess Lea.  Does the former even have a personality?  Where is our Han Solo character?  Try and think of one character in this film with his charisma.The script is atrocious, although I have come to expect this from a Lucas film.  Without the archetypes, however, the insipid dialogue becomes more apparent.  The actor portraying the emperor is really the only one able to pull it off.All that aside, the last twenty minutes or so are very satisfying for the Star Wars fan.  Personally, I always wanted to see Yoda and the Emperor go at it.  Annakin's (sp?) transformation was revelatory.  In short, specific scenes are entertaining, but the film as a whole falls flat.	3.0	Still missing something	2005-06-21	6	3	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2FIEYSK7Q43WQ	Stu Nimmo	Think what you want about Star Wars. Everyone is entitled to thier own opinion. However this film marks the end of a cinematic journey spanning generations. The series has brought about revolutions within the film industry and this, the final chapter, should be understood for what it is, a damn fine movie and the end of the greatest space-opera story ever.Too many people base their judgement of this film against that of the previous star wars movies. This is crazy, as the originals have been a crucial part of popular-culture for almost three decades.Revenge of the Sith is a great experience. You need only ask someone who has never seen the originals. It's narrative is sleek, and shaped perfectly around the fate of our hero and his fall from grace. It's a darker film, like The Empire Strikes Back, and doesn't hold back any of the horror that slowly swells within Anakin Skywalker.Star Wars has always been about friendship. It's really a series of buddy-movies, and this is why this one is so unique. It's the end of a friendship between two people, close enough to be brothers, and you see their connection destroyed with the clash of lightsabres.I would point out that Darth Vader's 'Noooooooo!' at the end of the film, however, is over the top and does ruin some of the empathy and feeling that has been steadily built to a climax. My only real complaint. But you can't hold the entire film responsible for one dodgy line, can you?In conclusion, Episode III- Revenge Of The Sith is an awesome thing to see as it represents why we watch films -for pure enjoyment and escapism.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3CX76V9TODND7	Sweeturchin	"You know, you'd think I'd learn, but I keep coming back for more punishment.It's George Lucas, so I don't expect great dialogue, and after seeing episodes 1 & 2, I knew better than to expect great characters (especially since the only real character development in episode 2 was in the bits that got cut from the theater release).  But I didn't expect to be actually BORED.The grand tragic fall of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader made absolutely no sense, partially because the entire relationship between him and Palpatine took place off screen in the space between the two movies.  Has Lucas never heard the phrase ""show don't tell""?  Movies are supposed to be a visual medium!  The other problem is that after three movies, the entire character is still such a cardboard cutout that I just didn't care what happened to him.  Lucas has often gotten around the fact that he doesn't know how to direct actors by casting superior actors who make up for his deficit.  Unfortunately Hayden Christensen doesn't quite cut it.Natalie Portman as Padme had nothing to do in this movie except to sigh and watch her increasing waistline (which is a crying shame because she's a fine actress).  I frankly didn't believe the grand tragic love story between these two because I can't see why they even like each other, much less fell in love.  Princess Leia and Han Solo had spark-these two come together with more of a dull thud.Kudos to Ewan McGreggor for actually making me believe the lines at the end about how he felt betrayed and dissappointed by Anakin -- despite the fact that we never actually see this wonderful relationship that they supposedly have.The fight scenes were pretty much more of the same-flash bang, oooo four lightsabers instead of one double ended one.  I'm sure 14year old boys the world over were duely impressed.  Why is it that the fight between Darth Vader and Obi Wan Kenobi at the end of the original movie is a fraction as long, has almost no acrobatics, and yet always holds my attention?  Could it be, oh I don't know, dramatic tension?  Completely absent here-I kept finding myself distracted-thinking about what I needed to do after the movie, whether I wanted another drink, about my laundry...The digital landscapes were fine-I'm sure Lucas spent millions on them.  But they were so busy, and shown so fast, that you didn't have time to get an impression of them.  They pretty much ran together-I had a hard time telling Alderaan and Naboo apart without other plot cues.  Nothing like the distinctiveness of Tatooine, Bespin or even Hoth.  Definitely a case of less is more.I don't even want to go into the entire first section of the movie.  I'm all for suspension of disbelief when dealing with technology so advanced that it may as well be magic.  But they could at least _try_ to be internally consistent and not insult our intelligence by only obeying physics when they feel like it?  (The contrast of smoke whipping off a ship in the process burning up in the atmosphere and fire retardent being sprayed in a perfectly straight line apparently unaffected by wind or velocity _in_the_same_frame_of_film_ was just the last straw).All together-this movie was two hours of my life I'm never going to get back."	1.0	Disappointing...as usual	2006-01-23	45	33	12
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A129ZGAS1K92YT	S. Welch	Though an imperfect realization of the series' promise, all the elements that should have made this film great are there.  On a primal (if not intellectual) level, it works brilliantly.  One question I ended up asking myself: if Anakin, as an eight year old boy, was too old to begin training as a Jedi, why did Obi Wan drop the infant Luke off with his aunt and uncle, then wait in the background until Luke was a young adult, before beginning his Jedi training?  Wouldn't it have made a lot more sense for Obi Wan to simply train Luke from infancy himself?  It makes no sense for him to have waited as long as he did, given his first hand knowledge of the failure experienced with Anakin.	4.0	Good as we're going to get	2005-06-15	2	1	1

Wilson ""tradersww"""	"When I walked out of ""The Phantom Menace"" in 1999, the excruciating thought slowly dawned on me: In terms of acting, casting, voice-overs, costumes, script and story, TPM was one of the worst films I'd ever seen.I realized - painfully - at that time that the glorious ship that was original Star Wars trilogy had just plummeted over the edge of a deadly waterfall and would never, ever be the same again.  The Originals (and even the Ewok-plagued ""Return of the Jedi"") would forever be tainted by the abomination that was ""Phantom Menace.""Not only was the plot of Phantom Menace pointless/boring and the story emotionless, but virtually every nuance of the film seemed perfectly designed to grate on my nerves: Comically-accented aliens, horrible creature CGI, impotent, non-threatening droid armies, laughable performances by supporting and lead actors alike (especially the horrific Jake Lloyd), and of course the worst offense of them all: Jar Jar Binks.Things improved somewhat in ""Attack of the Clones"": There was less of Jar Jar and no Jake Lloyd.  Still, the plot was uninteresting and didn't lead anywhere, the creature fx were still awful, and the acting by the supporting cast was embarrassing (I'm talking to you: Captain Typho, Queen of Naboo, Anakin's mother, Samuel Jackson, etc.).  I actually thought the much-maligned Hayden Christensen did a decent job of showing a darker side of Anakin, but Lucas' messy scripting/directing didn't allow him to do a whole lot with the role.Now we have ""Revenge of the Sith."" For the first time, a prequel shows small glimmers and hints of the glory of the original.  Not to get too far ahead of myself - overall, ROTS is a very mediocre film: with abysmal voice-over work (General Greivous and his Captain), poor handling of Anakin's turn to the dark side, some awful hamming by Ian McDairmard, more terrible acting by Samuel Jackson, and tons and tons of terrible, unfunny ""droid humor"" (Here's a hint, George: ""You're not funny"").Still, there are enough small things to evoke the wonder of the Orignals that I will begrudgingly give this film 4 stars.  These include:- The long opening shot of two starfighters with John Williams score.- The Emperor versus Yoda.- The coda, which connects the film to Episode IV.- And the shot of Vader, the Emperor and Tarkin overlooking the Death Star construction (goosebumps)."	4.0	"""This is the end for you, my master..."""	2005-11-02	6	4	2

"Here's my short and sweet take on Star Wars 3 : Much better.The first two prequels were not exactly what you would call great films.  Indeed, popular response to both ""Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones"" leaned on the negative side.  They were interesting showcases of special effects and helped put some of the earliest elements in place for the Star Wars tale.  However, on the whole, the acting and pacing of the first prequels was not very good.This time around, George Lucas stepped up to the plate and hit a homerun.  It is much, much better in all ways and will make both fans of the originals and the prequels happy.  It is very important that this part of the backstory be told well, otherwise it could have a negative effect on the whole Star Wars franchise.  The story was told right, as it is both understated and cunning in how it shows the final transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader.  I don't want to give any spoilers or anything, let's just say it is Anakins ""craving"" that gets the best of him.  He wants things to be right and perfect, even if that means using any method to make things take order... it is this original good intention that is the inner core of good that remains in Vader.  He wants so bad for things to take order and be good that he becomes the pawn of people who are much more evil than himself.  He is an essentially unwilling villain, he wants to be good so much that he becomes unwillingly bad.  Luke, on the other hand, is like his father in many, many ways except he doesn't let craving control him.  Luke wants there to be goodness and order, yet doesn't pursue it with such overwhelming, outright zeal.Thank you so much George Lucas for taking us back to the start with such skill and craft.  This is what the Star Wars prequels are all about."	4.0	Very good	2005-06-25	2	1	1

I would say it's the best of the prequels, although that isn't saying much because Episodes I & II were not very good to begin with.  ""Sith"" is a more serious, violent, occasionally graphic movie than the previous two installments.  As expected, the special effects are top-notch, but like in Episodes 1 & 2, they are overdone.Drawbacks to ""Sith:""1) The script by George Lucas is average at best.2) Samuel L. Jackson, a fine actor, is totally miscast in ""Star Wars.""3) The main characters are not as interesting & likeable as the cast from the original trilogy (Episodes 4, 5, and 6).4) The overall story of ""Sith"" is rather depressing. There is no Han Solo to make you laugh and keep things fun.That's my biggest complaint about Episodes 1, 2 and 3.  They're too serious, have too much special effects, and the main characters are not as likable as Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia.  R2-D2 and C3-PO have roles in all the movies, but they're not as interesting or enjoyable to watch in episodes 1-3.  C3-PO in particular seems aimless in the prequels."	3.0	Best of the prequels, but not as fun as the original trilogy	2005-05-20	7	6	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A203SM80W0ONMV	TAS	This movie is undisputedly one of the top five best movies I've seen in the past five years and I see a lot of movies!  In watching the center of the Star Wars episodes I was again over come with the same amazement I felt seeing the very first Star Wars release years ago.  I am in awe of the brilliance of George Lucas who not only has visions that are way ahead of his time, but the tenacity and story telling skills to actualize these visions.To begin the Star Wars journey at Episode IV and hate Darth Vadar as a villain and then come full circle to have compassion for Anakin as you see how he evolved into Vadar caused viewers to have a very different perspective than they would if the episodes were released at theaters beginning with Episode 1. This type of sequencing portrayed a beautiful lesson in the consequences of rushing to judgments.  Not that Vadar was a hero, but that sometimes there are reasons for poor choices made that are a result of character flaws combined with social influences - ergo compassion for the struggle of Vadar and sadness for the forfeiture of his potential for a fulfilled life.The movie had fantastic special effects, but that was an expectation.  Lucas has proven himself in that arena and with his experience over the years and the resources at his finger tips fans would accept no less.  Because of this, this film is mainly judged on the story.The actors in this story were wonderful.  I have long been a big fan of Ewan McGregor and have never seen him in a role wherein he didn't shine.  Hayden Christenson captured the essence of Anakin Skywalker as a conflicted young man appearing destined to destroy himself.  It is a great feat to draw immense compassion from an audience who knows a character is going to turn into an evil killer.In viewing this movie I was moved in a way different than my younger years when the first Star Wars movie came out.  In the early years it was about the special effects, the visuals, and the escape into a fairy tale in space.  Today it was about the depth and wisdom of the story - the morals and plight of the characters and how they were integrated with reality.  It has a grounding and story precision that will Make George Lucas the Shakespear of the our time.	5.0	The Circle is Complete	2005-06-04	8	5	3

After the battle with Mace Windu he had little other choice.I am not an expert on special effects but I did think the scenes and everything was good, music was brilliant, and I loved Yoda in this one.I know this has had many mixed reviews, but just on my part I loved it!!	5.0	Even good the third time!	2005-07-16	5	4	1

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3VI8RORRBKOM4	T. C. Pinney	"In 1977 I walked into ""A New Hope"". The beginning of a dream for me really! 27 times around the Sun later, I walked out of ""Revenge of the Sith"" and the dream ended. When I was a young boy I used to read all the books about how the future would be a space future with interplanetary excursions, huge spinning space stations and stations on the Moon or even Mars. Instead we got some godforsaken space truck that burns up every other time it launches. George Lucas allowed me to see places I've dreamed about in craft we should have by now. Sure alot of it was farfetched but it was a dream. In your dreams you can do wonderous things. Star Wars has done that for me. Now that it's over, I'll try to keep it going with books and such but without George Lucas's visuals it won't be the same. So it's back to being an Earthbound nothing in a world going nowhere and for what? Thanks for the dream George! NASA needs minds like yours!"	5.0	Time and Space the Dream	2005-06-25	2	1	1

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A17KIONCZPWOVS	Ted Gillman	Thankfully, this is the end of the Star Wars movies, but it did go out with a bang, in my humble opinion.  The story was essentially weak, with no particular character progression; however, it was a complex fable to bring an end to, whilst in the middle of the order of the episodes.  My hat is doffed to Lucas, for achieving what he has with this series; making the final film successful, despite it being an afterthought -- instead, it became an automatic must-see event.  I do, however, miss the olden episodes, when humor reigned, and the characters were fun, not indulgently dark, ardent and one-level.  But in those episodes, we, the audience had something to discover.  Now, with all the secrets in the Star Wars universe known, there is little that can be new.  Star Wars -- rest in peace, in the annals of cinematic immortality.	4.0	the last hurrah for an epic series	2005-08-24	8	6	2

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A268EEWUXYCA8Q	Terry Mesnard	"A long time ago in what now seems almost a galaxy away, Lucas started something that would change American Cinema.  The Star Wars movies not only have a fanatic cult following, but has influenced American Cinema and gave the world excellent characters.  A lot of time has passed and some okay prequels were made, prequels that certainly never lived up to the movies made so long ago.  Finally, there came Revenge of the Sith.  Was the wait worth it?  Does epsidoe 3 live up to the promise of the original three?  In a word: Hell yes.It took him 3 prequels, but Lucas finally created a story that, while doesn't equal the first three, at least is a pretty damn good story.  Episodes 4-6 of course are untouchable.  I don't think anyone could make another Star Wars movie that equaled what those movies ended up meaning to its fans.  However, Revenge of the Sith stacks up as not only a very good Star Wars movie but also one of the more entertaining movies released so far this year.From the opening space battle to the final shot on Tatooine, RoTS (what a bad accronym) gives us spectacular fights and wonderful cinematography.  Every battle is exciting, even the myriad of light saber duels continue to excite in ways that the previous two movies did not.Most important, the plot is really good.  Deep down below all of the poor and stilted dialogue and totally unromantic romantic scenes, there lies a story about anger, distrust, fear, and most important love.  I think the path to the Dark Side was done really well and far exceeded my expectations in terms of the all important ""why.""  Given the limitations of some of the dialogue, the actors all do a wonderful job.  Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine steals the show as far as I'm concerned.  I'm assuming the following is not a spoiler since it has been way over shadowed since the first prequel, but after certain events, Senator Palpatine's persona grows into the Emperor exceedingly well.  His transformation is perfect.  I'm glad Lucas could use the same actor for the Emperor because it really works and was pretty damn cool.The movie is pretty violent and definitely earns the PG-13 rating.  I'm glad Lucas did not hedge on this and try to tone it down for a PG rating.  It is a dark story and the events within are definitely the most violent of the Star Wars series.  It needed to be that way for Anakin to complete his transformation to Darth Vader.  But parents be warned, some of the images might be upsetting for small children.Overall, what we have here is not only a very good Star Wars movie, the best of the prequels, but also a very entertaining movie that combines great action, a dark story and some stilted dialogue.  I wish the romantic scenes could have been more believable because it would make the tragedy of this story much more powerful and heartfelt.  I wish Lucas would have spent as much time on the story of the previous two films as he must have done for this movie.  Lucas has stated that of the backstory he had for Eps 1-3, about 60% of that story was contained in the Sith with the other 40% for The Phantom Menace and the Attack of the Clones, and it shows.I was unsure of how I wanted to rate this, do I give it 5 stars like I would the original three?  I was leaning toward 4.5, but honestly 4.5 stars or 5, it doesn't really matter.  It's a great cinematic movie and one hell of a way to end America's favorite saga.  The first must see of the season."	5.0	Finally, a good prequel	2005-05-20	10	7	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2RABM2D60TMMV	Terry O. Murphy	"The most outstanding feature of this movie is that it renders the previous prequels largely irrelevant.The first thing you'll notice when watching this movie is the fast and furious pacing throughout; barely a moment in the film to catch your breath. Some might chalk that up to ""style"" but in fact this movie's don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-it pace is out of necessity rather than a director's filming style. Lucas wasted so much screen time in the prequels with useless Anakin Skywalker backstory and exposition that when it came time for the final film, it looks like it suddenly dawned on him that he really needed to tell the story he set out to tell from the first prequel - how Luke Skywalker's father, Anakin, became Darth Vader. And after the conclusion of Attack of the Clones, that story was still ""far far away"" from being told.So, hurry up and tell it pretty much summarizes Revenge of the Sith. No time for answers to questions raised in the other prequels, such as who altered the star charts in the Jedi library removing the existence of the planet Camino, the clone-making planet central to the theme of Attack of the Clones. In the Attack of the Clones DVD extras, Lucas says that question would be answered in Revenge of the Sith. It wasn't. Why? No time. (And in the long run, it probably doesn't matter anyway - sigh.) There's barely enough time to cover the real downfall of Anakin. Thus, new characters that were introduced in the prequels spending copious amounts of screen time amount to nothing in Revenge of the Sith. Qui Jon, Darth Maul and other major characters from the prequels have a story-contributing factor of zilch by the time Revenge of the Sith rolls around.Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed this film. But, if you want to watch the entire Star Wars series as a whole, do yourself a favor and skip episodes one and two. All you need to do is watch three, four, five, and six. You'll save yourself a lot of time and you won't miss a thing."	3.0	It's good, but...	2005-08-15	10	4	6

I found some of the new characters to be very stupid, take General Grevious for example, is it just me or did he sound like your grandpa with emphysema (I didn't know droids could smoke cigarettes), and come on, the little droids cracking jokes were just plain silly, droids aren't programmed with a sense of humor.  This was by far not the best movie I've seen this year.Don't get me wrong, this movie reminded me a lot of Return of the Jedi (although the light saber battles could have been better, didn't it seem like Anakin beat up on Count Dooku just a little?).  The movie climaxed with an epic battle between Anakin and Obi Wan, that I've been waiting for ever since Obi Wan and Darth Vader mentioned it in Episode IV. I was always curious how Anakin became Darth Vader, gee, one minute he has full use of his body (except for the right hand, of course), the next he's a quadraplegic, that would definitely make me say ""I hate you"".  This movie was full of action, a lot more than I expected, even the beginning titles (which are usually subdued) said WAR!  Didn't the plot of this movie remind anyone of Empire though?  The Emperor uses the same mind trick on Anakin, that Anakin (as Darth Vader) uses on Luke in Empire, except for the fact that the pain in this one could have been prevented, if Anakin had struck down the Emperor when he'd had the chance to do so.All criticism aside, this was an excellent wrap up to the new trilogy, and didn't leave a lot of unanswered questions.  You find out why Luke and Leia are split up and why Obi Wan is on Tatooine (which I wasn't aware of, and was a little puzzled by when I saw it).  I don't agree with some of the other reviewers saying that this is the best of all of the movies (these are usually the younger viewers, who obviously didn't grow up with original trilogy and are used to new school special effects, that the movie studios use to dazzle the audience into forgetting that the story is important too).  Any old school Star Wars fan knows that Empire was the best, and every other sequel or prequel pales in comparison.  It is (other than Terminator 2, of course) one of the best sequels of all time.I recommend this movie to anyone who wonders how Episode II and IV are connected, it's definitely worth a look.

Forget about everything you've heard or read about this film! Nothing can compare with - or prepare you for - the intensity of what you're about to experience. George Lucas has outdone himself, again, with this one - exponentially.... If Star Wars is air, The Empire Strikes Back is water, and Return of The Jedi is earth, then Revenge of The Sith is absolutely fire! It's the quintessential, penultimate union of analog and digital. It has the charm of Star Wars, the tragedy of Empire, the intensity of Jedi, and the digital effect mastery of both Menace and Clones. This film is a culmination and recapitulation of all that has come before - and more. It all comes full-circle here, urobolically!... The movie is stunning and beautiful, and the acting is superb. Lucas has definitely brushed-up on his Euripides. It has the symmetry of Kubrick, the dynamics of Kurosawa, and the panorama of Attenborough. This ain't George Jetson, kids. This isn't even 12 Monkeys on steroids. This is way beyond all that! There's no fooling around here, and no fat in this movie anywhere; it's lean, mean, and ripped! Bruce Lee is smiling in heaven.

It may be the best of the newer films but does it actually compare to the old ones?  Nope, sorry.  This just can't compare to the likes of A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back.  It's not even as good as Return of the Jedi, my least favorite of the old trilogy(Those stupid ewoks!).  Hayden Christensen has been terrible in these films and doesn't do much better in this one than in Attack of the Clones.  Natalie Portman gives another wooden performance.  The story to this one does pick up but with the bad acting from the two most important characters and the fact that there have been two other terrible films just can't redeem this series at all.  Like most of the others only Ewan McGregor's character and the great special effects give it any redeeming qualities.  Your money is better spent trying to find the old laser disk versions of the old trilogy.  However, if you want to get a DVD go order Skinny Puppy's The Greater Wrong of the Right Live.  A much better use of your hard earned money if you want a recent release.	2.0	About As Bad As The Other Chapters In The New Trilogy	2005-10-18	23	7	16

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2FVW24CH83R2P	"TheGodfather ""TheGodfather"""	"""Revenge of the Sith"" finally salvages the prequel trilogy and has some solid moments, but is not without George Lucas' eccentric flaws.  I love the opening sequence with the space battle, but then the part with the little robots attacking Obi-Wan's ship was cheesy, as was Dooku's flip over the railing, and the entire ""elevator operator"" antics while inside General Grievous' ship.  The fight scene itself was cool, as well as Anakin being goaded by Palpatine to kill Dooku.  General Grievous turns out to be nothing like the intimidating character established in the Clone Wars cartoons, and no one will understand why he is wheezing unless they have seen the cartoons.  His MagnaGuards are pretty cool.  The dialogue between Grievous and Anakin/Obi-Wan is terrible after their too-easy capture.  Anakin: ""I always thought you would be taller.""  Grievous: ""Jedi scum!"" Obi-Wan: ""...and this time you won't escape.""  Horrible.Anakin looks the part, and Ewan McGregor really grew into his role and truly looks and acts like Obi-Wan.  The whole Jedi debate about Palpatine, and Palpatine's attempt to sew doubt in Anakin's mind about the Jedi was pretty well done, but the issue about Anakin being appointed as a Jedi Master or not was a weak argument - he clearly was not ready.  The entire scene between Anakin and Palpatine in the theater was very well done.  When Mace Windu and three other Jedi confront Palpatine, some other weak points again: why do they ignite their lightsabers?  Completely unnecessary.  Then Palpatine does a silly spin and kills the other three (elite) Jedi's way too easy.  No way.  The ensuing battle with Mace and Anakin's arrival and his inner struggle whether or not to aid Palpatine is pretty well done.  Then another really weak spot: Anakin gives in way too easy to Palpatine; there is just not a strong enough reason established for Anakin to give in.  Lucas fails to articulate that Anakin can't bear to lose someone else that is close to him, but to unconditionally turn to the dark side just to attempt to save Padme was pretty weak.  Then Palpatine gives Anakin orders to attack the Jedi temple and then ""go to Mustafar...""  How about one task at a time?  Attacking the temple should be no piece of cake.  The imagery of Anakin leading the troops to the temple is cool.  However, Lucas again really drops the ball - why not show more of the fight and eliminate the scene where Anakin kills the ""younglings""?  Totally unnecessary, and again there is not enough motivation for him to personally kill children.  The scene where Anakin assassinates the Trade Federation leaders at Mustafar was pretty cool, and I also liked the imagery of Anakin staring out into the sun showing some remorse for what he has done (accompanied by a powerful John Williams piece of music).  Obi-Wan's attack of Utapau had its moments, but again General Grievous is never really established as the deadly character as portrayed in the cartoons.  I really liked how the Clone trooper units had their own distinctive looks, and the elimination of their Jedi leaders was well done.  The battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan starts out awesome, but gets a little silly after awhile with the platforms and trying to hack away at each on a piece of the station while it is about to go over a lava ""waterfall"".  It is still one of the best lightsaber duels.  What is clearly missing is Obi-Wan's belief that there is still good in Anakin and an attempt to draw him back.  This was plainly established in ROTJ by Darth Vader: ""Obi-Wan once thought as you do"".  The battle between Yoda and Palpatine was kind of silly, but was effective enough.  Then comes the interesting juxtaposition of Padme's birth of the twins and Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader as we know him.  I didn't expect Darth Vader's first words to be about asking where Padme was.Overall, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a success, but it is not without its silly ""Lucasism"" drawbacks and terrible dialogue; he gave us almost what we expected.  Still too many gratuitous references to  the classic trilogy.  I would have scrapped about 30% of the movie and went back to the drawing board.  I always thought in the classic trilogy that Obi-Wan was just wearing desert clothes, but that turned out to be his outfit in the prequels.  So he is trying to keep a low profile and still wearing his Jedi clothes?  It was too early to show the Empire building the Death Star, which George Lucas even conceded to later. Revenge of the Sith has some really cool imagery and soundtrack; it is a dark movie (as it should be).  It could have been even better, but the same especially goes for the other prequels and ROTJ."	4.0	Finally, George Lucas almost gets it right	2010-09-24	3	1	2

Its also the last film to be released in theater's.Taking place, roughly, three to five years after the events in ""Episode II: Attack Of The Clones"", ""Sith"" opens with Obi-Wan Kenobi & his former apprentice turned Jedi Knight, Anakin Skywalker on a rescue mission to save Supreme Chancelor Palpatine from seperatist forces under the command of Count Dooku & led by General Grievous.With the rescue a success, the Jedi return to the city planet of Coruscant with Palpatine. The Jedi Council reassign Anakin to be Palpatine's bodyguard, with the Chancelor bestowing Skywalker the honor of being his voice on the Jedi Council. But, The Jedi Council bristles at this idea, usually they  choose who is to join them. But, because this is a special request from a high-ranking official, they grant Skywalker a seat with them just not the rank of Jedi Master (a strict requirement needed to become a member). To Anakin, this is a kick to the groin & through some temprement with Obi-Wan Kenobi,  a senior member of the Council, he finds out the Jedi's true reason as to why he has a seat. The Jedi want Anakin to spy on Palpatine & his motives. To Anakin its dishonesty & immoral. Quickly, Anakin finds his loyalties divided.That's when it all goes to hell. Palpatine reveals his true self, slowly luring Anakin to the Dark Side, insuring that if he joins with him they both can end the war & bring peace to the galaxy. One thing stands in the way. The Jedi don't trust Palpatine & try to stop him. Anakin intervenes & makes his final decision. Its a bad one.Now embracing the Dark Side of ""The Force"", Palpatine, with unlimited power, orders Anakin, now the Sith Lord, Darth Vader, to show no mercy & destroy all Jedi, for they are now traders of the Republic (according to Palpatine what the Jedi have done to him is treason).When the only surviving members of the Jedi Knighthood, Obi-Wan & Jedi Council Master, Yoda, find out what has happened, Yoda knows what must be done. In order to stop the Sith, both the Master & the Apprentice must be stopped, fatally. Obi-Wan must face Darth Vader, while Yoda faces off against Darth Sidious, better known, now, as Emperor Palpatine.With the phantom menace finally revealed & the attack of the clones &, the war itself, coming to a tragic conclusion, the galaxy is plummetted into its darkest days feeling the full brunt of the revenge of the Sith. But, as the newly formed Empire, strikes back, a new hope awakens that will bring balance to ""The Force"", freedom to the galaxy, & the return of the Jedi.""Revenge Of The Sith"" is non-stop action. From the prologue all the way through to the end. The only down side is the scenes with Anakin & wife, Padme. The interaction between them is still ""limited"", but, stomachable. Darth Vader's scream at the end of ""Sith"" should have been reworked (he was more pissed off at chasing the Energizer Bunny, than he is here!).The cast is still great. Ian Mcdiarmid chews the scenery as the newly exposed Emperor. Ewan McGregor is great as Obi-Wan. I couldn't help, but, feel sorry for him as he helplessly watched Anakin turn to the Dark Side.The CGI effects are awesome. The first half hour to forty minutes of ""Sith"" blow the other two episodes away. Even the subtle scenes get a boost from the visual effects (it should get nominated for an Oscar in this category). John Williams' score is, as always, top notch.*** Some things you may have missed when watching ""Sith""... ***-During the opening dogfight, Anakin speaks the line ""This is where the fun begins."" This is a variation of the line Han Solo speaks in the original ""Star Wars"", ""Here's where the fun begins.""-The color of Anakin's starfighter is yellow - the same color scheme his podracer was in ""Episode I"".-Its official, the bad feeling line is in every ""Star Wars"" film.-At the end of the film Padme tells Obi-Wan that Anakin still has good in him. This line is echoed in the future by her son, Luke, to her daughter, Leia, in ""Return of the Jedi"".-During ""Sith""'s opening sabre duel pay close attention to the sabre clashes on the first closeup of Palpatine. Sound familiar?If your a die-hard fan they should. They are the opening sabre clashes to the Luke/Vader duel in ""Empire"".-As Anakin frees Palpatine from his bindings, the Chancelor speaks to the Jedi Knight about revenge, his mother & the sandpeople. At the end of this line the sandpeople battle cry can be heard faintly on the soundtrack.-After Anakin crashes whats left of Greivous's battleship into Coruscant, in the next shot, pay close attention to the bottom of the screen as the shuttlecraft touches down on the senate building. You should be able to see The Millenium Falcon landing underneath the shuttlecraft on the next level.-General Grievous' hunch & long bonylike robotic fingers are modeled after the vampire in the classic silent film ""Nosferatu"". Also, the General's cough belongs to a famous person. George Lucas.-George Lucas makes his first & only cameo appearance in the saga. As Anakin charges up the stairs to Palpatine's private viewing box (passing the big breasted yellow-orange lady!), entering the main doorway, Lucas & his daughter are just left to the screen.-The scene where Yoda departs the wookie planet in his little podship is very similar to the end scene of ""E.T."" (Steven Spielberg helped storyboard the Grievous/Kenobi duel, & the two end sabre duels for ""Sith"")-I think, Lucas gave a nod to Gene Roddenberry & ""Star Trek"". All the computer screen readout fonts on the planet Mustafar, look, suspicously, like the Klingon language. Also, at the end of the film, there is a length wide shot of Padme lying on a medical bed in a white gown with her medical status on a screen just behind the table. This is almost an exact shot of the Ilya in sickbay shot from ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"". Whether this was intentional or not, I don't know.-While Anakin is being operated on, at the end of the film, there is an overhead shot of him on the operating table with med-droids surrounding him. Pay close attention to the way the floorlighting is situated. Its placed in a circular motion around the table to form a perfect copy of the Imperial Insignia.-Darth Vader breaking his bindings that holds him to the med table is a tribute to Boris Karloff & ""Frankenstein"". Also, Anakin has a scar on the left side of his face that is reminiscent to the one Frankenstein has.-The last shot of the film is a classic moment in the saga, setting the stage for the original trilogy & a nod to ""Star Wars"" in general. But, its also similar to another film - ""Gone With The Wind"" (your grandma's favorite movie) with Scarlett O' Hara looking toward the horizon & another day. So it is with ""Star Wars"".""Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith"" has amassed 380 million dollars at the box office (it currently ranks as the 7th highest grossing film of all time, domestically) & will be released on home video on November 1st (with deleted scenes of Bai Ling, the birth of the Rebel Alliance, & Yoda arriving on Dagobah), is viewed best in the widescreen format in Dolby Digital EX & is THX certified to actually have the prescence of the Sith in your living room & make your next door neighbors move down the street."	5.0	The Birth Of An Empire & The Legacy That Is Vader	2005-05-25	16	9	7

I was for the first movie in the summer of 1977, but I was in high school.I was still in high school when THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK was released, but I was furious with the movie for ending just when things were getting started.  In fact, EMPIRE didn't end, it just stopped.  And we had to wait three years to find out what happened next.When we did, it was RETURN OF THE JEDI, which I thoroughly despised.  It was a two-hour-plus commercial for Star Wars toys while the human characters loitered in the background.  When even the bad guys showed up as happy ghosts for another of George Lucas' yearbook photo endings, I'd given up.With 20 years to think of something new and cool (other than special effects), they release THE PHANTOM MENACE.  Total snooze.  I didn't even see ATTACK OF THE CLONES in the theatre, especially after I'd heard it described as ""C-Span from another galaxy.""But I decided to see the last one, REVENGE OF THE SITH.  It's a good movie!  The action keeps moving, the conflicts show some surprising depth for a series that paints its heroes and villians with incredibly broad strokes, and the special effects are the best.So, if you're one of the very few on this planet who haven't seen any of the Star Wars films, I would heartily recommend this one and the very first one they made in 1977.The rest are pretty lame."	4.0	Finally, a good Star Wars movie...since 1977	2006-06-04	8	1	7
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AMLV3B3JDF4HD	The Kite	While the graphics and creatures are fun to watch, the acting and script were, if this is possible, worse than the previous two. Lucas did a great job with the old three because he was making them as action adventure movies. In these new three, he attempts to portray drama and it comes across cheesy, fake, and often laughable. The dialogue is cliched and poorly delivered. There have only been three good actors in these new three movies, and two of them let us down in this finale. Christopher Lee by dying in the first scene and Ewan McGregor by having zero zeal in his delivery. Lord Sidious was excellent on the other hand, outshining anyone else in the poorly casted entourage. The one redeeming part of the flick? No Jar Jar Binks.	1.0	Face it, Lucas, drama isn't your strength	2005-05-28	32	23	9

Unlike many who didn't like Episode II, I really enjoyed Episode II.  Episode III is like Episode II on steroids.  There is a LOT more computer generated effects, which some people don't seem to like (I love them).As far as the story goes, seeing Anakin make difficult decisions that ultimately lead to his transformation into Darth Vader is very rewarding.  Despite a few corny and quirky moments where the Chancellor cackles gleefully like a witch, or speaks in child-like voices that are supposed to sound menacing, the movie stays true to the Star Wars spirit and introduces some of the ships, weapons and hardware we first saw in Episode IV.Although Episode V: Empire Strikes Back remains my all time favorite, followed closely by Episode IV: A New Hope, Revenge of the Sith places nicely at third for me.Watching this film will make all of the scenes you've come to know from the original trilogy seem much more important.  In fact, I couldn't wait to get home and watch the trilogy all over again after seeing ""Sith"".Filled with action, and without question the best special effects of all 6 films, Revenge of the Sith is a must-see for anyone who even mildly enjoys the Star Wars saga."	4.0	A fitting end to the saga.	2005-05-30	7	4	3

Score by John WilliamsStarring Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, IanMcDiarmid, Frank Oz, Samuel Jackson, Jimmy Smits, Anthony Daniels,Temura Morrison, Ahmed Best, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, Matthew Wood,James Earl Jones and Christopher Lee.Three years after ATTACK OF THE CLONES, the seccesionist army, itsleader Count Dooku having been killed by Anakin Skywalker, is slowingbeing defeated and yet Chancellor Palpatine is still seizing greaterand greater authority as well as conspiring against the Jedi.  Seducedby the strangely well versed in the Force Palpatine, Anakin Skywalkertotters close to embracing the Dark Side. Finally long held secrets arerevealed and the Sith have their final revenge. The Galactic Republicfalls and the Empire rises. There is no hope.Though irritating for its casual discarding of Lee's Count Dooku to bereplaced by the less interesting General Grevious, this is still apowerful moving tale of evil triumphant, betrayal and death.  Gone arethe stupidities of the previous(and later) films in the series.  Eviland tragedy apparently enforced discipline on Lucas and all to the goodand triumph of the film.  There is precious little here to criticize inwhat is practically a perfect film. From the score to the script,everyone is doing their best work. The cast is fantastic. The finalconfrontation between Christensen and McGregor---special effects andaction aside---is heartbreaking and sad.  And at the center of the filmis the staggering chilling brilliant performance by McDiarmid as theincredibly evil Darth Sidious. Easily worthy of Karloff or Lugosi orAtwill or...well Lee at their most iconic. It is a great pity that theactor was never able to have a film career outside of this series. Hecould have been a great horror star with the right vehicles.This is the film that---though considered science fiction---firmly putthe STAR WARS series into the horror genre....the classic horror genre.Very likley to be considered a classic as time passes.Recommended.	5.0	Truly an impressive achievement	2011-01-28	2	2	0
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AENS008HCBVC5	Theodore Illenberg	"The first two episodes were basically set ups for the Revenge of the Sith. Revenge of the Sith basically ties everything together. Anakin was basically tricked into turning to the dark side. Anakinh was having bad dreams about Padame. The emperor tricked him into believing if he turned to the dark side he can save his wife. Through out the movie Anakin was struggling with his own personal desires and his duty as a Jedi.This episode was darker than the previous episodes. It almost makes the original Star Wars appear antiiclimatic. When Padme gave birth to her children she said their names ""Luke"" and ""Leia"". This served as bridge to the original series. Even though the mood of the film was sad, the final scene where Luke and Leia were given to their adoptive parents was a glimmer of hope.THe special effects were very good. The opening fight scene made me dizzy. The fight between Anakin and Obi-Won was very well done. This scene gives new meaning to the fight scene between Obi-won and Darth Vader in the original Star Wars. The fight was not over and they needed to face each other again."	5.0	The Story is complete	2005-05-27	0	0	0
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2M597GCCE1N2S	"the one and only ""david"""	The New Trilogy by MR. Lucas wasn't nearly as good as the old one, especially when only the first two were publically viewed. But the third installment manages to save the other two and does a WONDERFUL job of linking episode four and three together, thus making only two out of six episodes bad, which isn't too bad for a thirty year old saga that many people still enjoy [Including me.....]This is where all your questions will be answered, with the main one of how does Anakin turn to the Dark Side? With the Clone Troopers led by Jedi generals in war against the trade federation droids and Count Dooku [Who does not have a big role in this movie] Anakin [Hayden Christensen] starts the path to the dark side.If there was one thing that didn't do it so well for me, it would be the death of Count Dooku so early in the movie. I was predicting myself that Anakin and Dooku would fight it out for some reason in a climactic battle, but Dooku dies within the first 10 minutes. [Sorry to spoil the movie if any of you havent seen it.] I will say however that Obi-Wan and Anakin's fight is also very well done, with emotion at its best near the end.It's Anakin's conversations with the secretly evil Palpatine [Played by Ian McDiarmid] that makes the movie much more convincable and amazing. The chemistry these two have is just what everyone should expect from a future master and apprentice. Palpatine promises Anakin power and wisdom, two things that Anakin wants, but knows they will lead him to the Dark Side.But its the hook that Palpatine tells Anakin about saving his wife Padme from death in child labor that eventually persuades one of the most evil characters in history to taking up Palpatines right hand side. The transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader is very well done, you can tell all through the movie of his attitude change, his physical appearances, and his personal thoughts.But that is just a fraction of what makes this movie so good, although its the most important fraction. The battle scenes are frequent and I seem to think that even if you went to the bathroom without pausing during a battle, when you return they will still be fighting. Don't take that as a bad thing; Each fight scene is as unique as the last:From a spaceship battle in the very beginning of a rescue mission, to a fight with a four armed droid, to the clone troopers turing on the Jedi on different planets, to a fight on the Wookie planet of Kashyyyk, to one of the best one on one lightsaber fights between Obi-Wan and Anakin at the end. So many fights, each one as great as the other, guarantees this movie will never be boring.......And to all you Yoda lovers, he does fight in this movie. Emperor Palpatine and Yoda do meet in a lightsaber fight. And many people who viewed the movie with me in the theaters couldn't help but cheer Yoda on...This is definately the best of the new three movies. The relationship of Palpatine and Anakin is the true reason you should see this movie......... [But that's just my opinion] Other characters are great in this movie as well:Obi Wan [played by Evan McGregor] is still superb as the famous Jedi Master, concerned with Anakin's state of mind. And even Padme [Natalie Portman] was pretty good as a wife who is concerned for her husband and the safety of the kids. Definately a great movie that deserves to be seen.	5.0	Much, much better than the last two in the new trilogy....	2005-08-04	10	8	2

I had high hopes for episode 3 to wrap up the story nice and i was hoping george lucas would not mess up things but my hopes were met as episode 3 ends things in a sad way but if you saw the old trilogy you know everything ends up okay.I'm guessing you probably know the plot of star wars 3 and if you have been living in a rock for the past 2 months well here it is.Anakin Skywalker(Hayden C.) and Obi-wan-kenobi(ewan mcgregor)must save senator palaptine from the clutches of the sith since he has been captured by them.Also The two jedi's must try to kill general grievious so the clone wars can end and the republic can return to high power.But As you know young Anakin Skywalker meets the evil sith lord and the sith lord trys to get anakin to join the darkside and drama ensues.The battle scenes with the jetfighters are just terrific and the lightsaber battles are very well done.This movie is very action packed and will pretty much satisfy your inner action fan. But it would be helpful if you atleast saw episode 2 to atleast grasp some of the events going on.The only complaints i have are some of hayden's lines are poory executed and overacted when they should have been powerful and meaningful.And this plays a role towards the ending.So in conclusion i tell you to see this movie but i urge you to atleast see Episode 2 and maybe squeeze in episode 1, but mostly episode 2.Pros+great action scenes+great special effects+great character back-stories+great way to end star wars saga+great musical scoreCons-Some over-dramatized lines-a Bit boring script.(but action scenes save this from messing up the movie)Total Score-4 stars out of 5	4.0	Episode 3 wraps up the star wars story nice and neat.	2005-07-05	4	2	2

This was so much darker, and carried an emotional resonance unlike any prior installments- you feel everything that is at stake in this one, and when the payoff comes, it's done as Shakeperian tragedy.

It is 10 times better then the first two, and while the OT is still my favorite, Revenge of the Sith is right up there with them. Revenge of the Sith (ROTS) has a more adult feeling to it which almost doesn't make it feel star warsy but it makes for a great movie. There might be one line that is a little cheesy but it is delivered well, which brings me to the acting in the movie. The acting was far superior to the first two. Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portmen were actually two of the better actors in this movie, and no, I am not saying that the movie sucked. Palpatine was very evil and Yoda in CGI was great. They even had a few sarcastic remarks for each other, which is something the prequals has been missing as well. The only thing I can say I didn't like was that it was too short. Maybe the plot could have been divided into 2 movies. But besides that this movie rocked. It redeems my love for star wars.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A5W5CQCOLBQTK	"The Reject ""Rogue"""	This is with out question, the best of the new trilogy!!! This completes the circle and now you begin too see what Episode 1 and 2 were building up too and see the rise of The Galatic Empire/ and how Darth Vader came to be, the fall of the Republic, the showdown between Obi Wan and Anakin.... and between Darth Sidious and Yoda!!!I know that some hardcore fans of Star Wars says that the movies are bad, because they are different, true a lot of people perfer vintage Star Wars over the new trilogy and vice versa, for others, but both sides have to agree that it was very important to release Episode: 1,2, and 3!!! Episode 3 was defintely one of the best movies, but I myself see Star Wars as 1 long movie, and I love each part of the saga equally!!!The movie itself was probably the best put together Star Wars, with much more emotion, drama, sheer excitment, action, crazy plot twists, and revealing much about why the Star Wars universe is the way it is!!! The movie is plainly amazing and unbelievable!!!This is the last part of the new/ modern day triolgy, but not the last movie, ... Lucas is planning on releasing an episode 7,8,and 9 which will be about when the light side finally defeats the dark side and the evnts that take place during the new republic, the new jedi order, and the return of Jar Jar Binks!!! He is also planning to come out with a show too.... your probably want to know where I got this info right well check out [...] which tells you everything you need to know about the Star Wars universe!!! It's too bad that he won't begin production till 2014, yeah, yeah I know it won't be the same from the original triolgy, which is the best, but I'm still interested!!!I'm sorry I kind of went off rambling, but overall this is a great movie that puts the puzzle together in your head and you fully realize the story!!! For, example you see in Episode 1, that Anakin was strong from the force from the very begging, and see how his sense of fear, and saddness for his mother, along with Anakin meets Padme, mother of Luke and Leia!!!Meanwhile you see how The Republic is getting old and is useless to do anything, as Phalphtine/ Darth Sidous(a.k.a The Emperor) begins his plot to destroy the senate, with him becoming the leader of the senate, and with his darkness clouding and corrupting the senate!!! This is when the sith return and the showdown betwen Darth Maul... and how Obi Wan Kenobi takes Anakin as his aprentice and teaches him in ways in the force!!!In Episode 2, the same stuff is going on, but in this film Anakin deals with his more intense emotions and begins his journey down the dark side!!! Meanwhile, the Clone Wars begin and a grim mystery behind the army, along with the Seperatist movement!!! You now see where the Imperial fleet and Storm Troppers come from and how Jango Fett is the d.n.a host for the cloners and see how Borba Fett from the original film, comes to take his father's place as the famous bounty hunter in the origianl trilogy, one of my personal favorite characters!!!Then, you get to episode 3 which, shows how the little 9 year old boy on Tatooine becomes Darth Vader!!! It is important to watch all the films in order to understand and know the saga!!! Hey you can have your opinion on which Star Wars film is the best, but to me each part is important!!!Overall, this movie is plainly awesome, and is a must watch to any Star Wars fan!!! I give it a 5/5!!!	5.0	Best of The New Trilogy!!!!........... Filling in the Missing Pieces	2005-08-06	0	0	0

But the ""the boy done good"". I think from the pounding of the critics and many of the hard core fans, George pulls it out of the hat with a good closing of the loop. However!! I did predict after Episode I that Episode II may be called ""Attack of the Amnesia"" as the droids did need a bit of a memory wipe - Oh convenient. George if your going to do a film with amnesia -- go do Secret Revelation by Steve Bell.But Episode III has some great effects and ILM is kept busy beyond belief. The story comes around and we do see finally (needed 3 movies for it) how Darth gets so crispy and asthmatic. Crowning moment is when with the sound of plonking, Darth's helmet is dropped in place and we come full circle to the authentic technology of Episode IV -- that made the original Star Wars movies so Iconic.If you have all the others on tape, and widescreen and special edition and CD and CD widescreen -- then how can you not support the ""Give George Millions"" campaign a little more."	4.0	George comes good	2005-12-06	1	1	0
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AJTICRUXEP1P9	The Surly Aardvark	I don't have much original to say about this movie... Basically, the CW on RoTS is pretty much correct; some seriously uninspired acting and awkward dialogue, due to thrilling visuals somehow manages to be pretty good anyway. It's hard to imagine that talented actors such as Samuel Jackson and Natalie Wood could be to blame for the manifest acting deficiencies in this movie, more likely a.) Lucas can't direct actors for crap, and b.) wooden, unconvincing dialogue tends to result in wooden, unconvincing delivery.The Star Wars films have always been about action and mood. It's therefore no surprise that the movie's saving graces are its well-executed action sequences, and particularly its stirring visuals. I don't mean simply the spectacular space battles and light saber duels, as the settings and interior designs are lush and absorbing. Senator Palpatine in particular knows how to deck a place out, seeming to draw his decor from some mysterious, unspecified ancient culture.Like the rest of the Star Wars movies it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The technology is still mind-bogglingly impractical and convoluted. (Complicated insectoid droids that slowly dismantle opposing ships? Couldn't a missile do that a bit more efficiently? Don't get me started on the light sabers.) The characters also act in slightly Martian ways to advance the plot. How do we deal with a character that needs to be eliminated to make way for the original trilogy? If you think dying of sorrow seems like a rather... improbable plot development you're not alone. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the plot, however, is Anakin's descent to the dark side. This is really the center of the film and its main purpose in existing. When it turns out that a Jedi who has risen as high in the ranks as Anakin could be so easily manipulated, the whole thing seems a bit artificial.Even though this is the only episode of the three prequels that is any good, it still seems a bit superfluous. As entertaining as it is, it doesn't really enhance the movies that follow it. Had Anakin's descent to the dark side been more convincing, this might've become a vital addition to the series. Instead, it's simply a highly entertaining bonus.	4.0	Entertaining, a bit silly.	2005-08-17	3	0	3
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3NQSMTG612AF	TheTruthHurts	"2.5 starsFinally...the series of less-than-spectacular prequels to one of the most overrated series of films in history is over. Thank God. Once again, to my expectations, we have a film, like all of the other ""Star Wars"" films directed by George Lucas, with lots of fast-moving images, moderate excitement, and no intelligence nor soul. Once again, we have a film, like all of the others directed by Lucas, with atrocious acting, dialogue, and an overabundance of special effects that simply doesn't make up for the fact that there really isn't much behind them. To say that this film is mostly cornball is, in my opinion, an understatement; from the beginning, it almost feels like a B-movie. Examples? Okay. 1. Beginning scroll: ""War!"" (Lmao); 2. Darth: ""Nooooooo!"" (Lmfao); 3. Virtually every line of dialogue spoken in the movie (laughed pretty much all the way through). What intensity! (that's a joke). There are a couple of slightly interesting scenes, e.g. the tranformation of Palpatine to ""the emperor,"" and SPOILER: Anakin getting hacked and burned at the end (I actually almost felt some kind of emotion other than boredom during this scene), but mostly, it's the same-old, same-old, and nothing much more than what we witnessed in episodes one and two.If you told me that you honestly believed that these are high-quality films, I would tell you that you're simply kidding yourself, or that you've got no idea what a good film consists of. Most likely, you're one of those that, via the brainwashing power of hype (which is subconsciously the reason why you've seen half the crappy films that you assuredly have), felt that you had to buy these prequels because you already owned the originals (4,5,6) and you and your DVD collection simply couldn't be ""complete"" without them, and now you feel as though you must, as if you are obligated to do so (probably by something as dorky as ""Jedi honor""), defend them...? Am I hitting close to home? Get over it; realize that you can own the originals without ""needing"" these three pieces of what are essentially cinematic garbage, and sell them. It really is easier than you think, and you'll look back knowing that you did the right thing. Can you honestly sit through these ""films"" more than once? Anyway...The bottom line: ""Revenge of the Sith"" is not as good as any of the original three, and is not satisfying for fans who grew up with those movies. However, if you're responsible for one of the completely illogical ""WOW!! 5 STARS! BEST MOVIE EVER!"" reviews for eps. 1 or 2 on this site, you'll surely convince yourself that this is a masterpiece too; I'll admit that this one is very slightly more cohesive than ep. 2, but it is not as ""enjoyable"" as ep. 1. I enjoyed ep. 1, partly (though I never forgot it was nonsense), when I saw it in the theater. For the majority of normal, logical people, ""Sith"" is a rental and nothing more, and like eps. one and two, it won't stay with us for five minutes after we see it. To me, it simply felt more like a comedy than a serious, dramatic piece; a parody of itself, even. Ultimately, though, its genre must be drama, because I was so mystified and bored out of my skull by the perpetual CGI and simply ridiculous dialogue that my eyes were literally watering by the end. Can you imagine how great this series might have been if, say, anyone in the WORLD other than Lucas had directed them? Lol...p.s. Every negative vote you give me only assures me that I'm correct, as I'm clearly revealing that sometimes, the truth hurts...so keep 'em coming! The real truth is that like Lucas, Hollywood's days of making profits off of nonsense are numbered, as people slowly but surely realize the errors of their ways in continuing to extend the life-span of this virus by paying in excess of $10 per ticket to see something not worth $0.10 or ten seconds of their time..."	3.0	The best of them all...wait a minute...this isn't supposed to be funny?	2005-10-27	0	0	0

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1RZFX5PRKEXVE	Thomas M. Seay	"This film has raised the ire of America's Right Wing who would have us believe that ""Revenge of the Sith"" is yet another instance of Hollywood liberalism insidiously impressing itself upon the nation's youth.  After all, doesn't the Chancellor of the Republic echo Bush when he declares that fellow countrymen are ""either with us or against us""?If this film were a statement against present US imperial designs, I would be quite happy; however, Lucas has recorded that the script was written years ago.  In fact, this problem of war and the problem it presents for democracy is an old and universal theme, so it is not necessarily a sign of prescience on the part of Lucas.  Rather it is a sign that he has read history.Throughout the film we are reminded of the dangers of moral certainty.  When Padme observes that the war has diminished the democracy, Skywalker is shocked:  he has operated on the assumption that the Republic was unconditionally just.  A later moment also raises suspiciousness about the righteousness of the war.  When Luke is dispatched to kill the ""seperatists"", one of the rebels cries that all they wanted is peace.  Wait a minute!  There seems to be another side to the story.I saw the original Star Wars when I was 16 years old.  That was in the late 70s.  America was licking its wounds from the Vietnam war and trying to restore its confidence in itself.  Unfortunately this meant perpetuating the myth that America is alway right and on the side of good.  In some sense, Star Wars reflected that Zeitgeist.  However, over the last 30 years and six films, we have been disillusioned of this notion.  It turns out in Star Wars as in life, good and evil are not that clearcut.There are at least two sides to a story and more often many more sides than that.  Complex issues cannot be reduced to black and white, good and bad. We tell ourselves we are good and then go blind.  It is in such a state that we commit the worst sort of atrocities in the name of Good."	5.0	Healthy Dose of Moral Amiguity	2005-05-30	8	2	6
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"This Film Care For I Did Not!Let's start with the good stuff.The beginning battle is visually impressive and ends in a spectacular way. Obi Wan (Ewan McGregor) and Annakin (Hayden Christensen) are sent to rescue Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from the Droids who have captured him. Each in a ship, they navigate through a maze of droids and other ships to find him. The visual effects in the battle are very well-done and the sequence ends with a flourish bringing back memories of the first three ""Star Wars"" films. A rousing way to start the film.Act Three of the film is also very memorable. In part, Lucas is tying all of the loose strings together taking us to the beginning of ""Star Wars"". Obi Wan hunts Annakin down and battles with him on a volcanic planet. At the same time, we see Yoda fighting with Darth Sithius. Intercutting between these fights, we see some truly mesmerizing action. One of the most brilliant things Lucas did was to make Yoda an action star. The little green guy can really get around and fight with the best of them. During these two battles, Padme (Natalie Portman) goes into labor. We also see how her two children, Luke and Leia, became separated. For anyone who has seen ""Star Wars"" this is powerful stuff. ""Star Wars"" was the beginning of many phenomenons and to get to the beginning of that film, to understand how Luke ended up on Tatooine, how Yoda went into exile, how Darth Vader ended up disfigured and behind a mask, all of this will naturally create a powerful experience for anyone who grew up with the three films.Are these powerful feelings created by the drama, the acting, the dialogue? No. They are created by our attachment to beloved films that were created over two decades ago.Now the bad stuff. Well, actually, we have already begun talking about that.As George Lucas has fallen deeper and deeper into his magical box of CGI (Computer Generated Effects) he has lost more and more touch with his human actors. One of his early successes, ""American Graffiti"", was about kids growing up in a small town in the 60s. No CGI effects, a pretty good film. ""Star Wars"" was a groundbreaking film. Featuring real actors on real locations. The film had a heart and soul. We cared about Luke and Leia and Hans Solo. Hell, we even cared about Chewbacca and we can't even understand what he is saying.""Star Wars"" featured real people in an outer space opera. The special effects were created with models and weren't the focus of the attention. As money began pouring in, and Lucas and his team developed new special effects, he wanted to use them in his films, to show them off. These gradually became more predominant. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" features more and more special effects and a more polished production design. ""Return of The Jedi"" is even more advanced. But they feature real people on real sets. We feel a connection when we watch these films.When Lucas announced the production of the newest trilogy, episodes 1 through 3, he said that he now had the tools necessary to make the film. The `tools'! Notice that he isn't concerned with the actors. The first two episodes were abysmal. Virtually everything was created in the computer, characters, backgrounds, action sequences, special effects. The actors walked numbly through the films spouting terrible, terrible dialogue. Either it was banal and trite or it was boring and over-expository. I remember well my shock at how bad Episode 1 was, after waiting hours in line for a ticket and then hours in line for a seat. Episode 2 was, if anything, worse, because it was more boring. It had a distinct lack of action and focused on the politics of the story.I don't know why I was expecting Episode 3 to reach the heights of the first trilogy. There is no way that it could. But I was hoping it would be better than the previous two episodes of this current cycle.In many ways, it is better. The special effects are great. But this is almost a given in any film with Lucas' hands on it. He created a company that is considered by many to be the company for special effects in Hollywood. They have their hands on virtually every film's CGI work. There is no way the special effects could or would be anything less than perfect.As mentioned, the action scenes at the beginning and end of the film are very good. During the middle of the film, there is a lot of cutting back and forth between various battles, action scenes and drama. It makes them hard to follow, because we don't have enough time to concentrate on the characters. Unfortunately, one of these scenes is the droid battle on the Wookie planet. Because there is so much cutting back and forth from it, we can't enjoy the setting or the characters.During the `love scenes' between Padme and Annakin (Portman and Christensen) people were actually laughing. These scenes are supposed to be serious and convey the feelings they have for one another. Instead, they resemble high school kids writing in their binders ""I Heart Annie"". Someone, perhaps Lucas, was unable or unwilling to have them show any real emotion. Its a shame, because they are the heart and soul of the film. I never once believed that Annakin actually loved her. Because we can't believe in them, we don't care about them.I think Lucas should be lauded for his work creating special effects. But he doesn't seem to care about the humans in his films. He seems like a kid in a CGI shop. He has access to all of these neat tricks and wants to use as many as possible. But because he has spent so much time and money on this aspect of the film, the human element is given short shrift. Too bad. Because the human element is what made the first three ""Star Wars"" films so memorable."	3.0	Great use of special effects, Poor use of actors	2005-05-20	12	7	5
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ATRADZF9IH16G	Tijiki Mojo	Perhaps after looking at my title you thought I meant in a good way, sadly, I don't. George Lucas had an absolutely phenomenal series when he did 3,4, and 5. The special effect sucked, but other than that they were terrific. Then out comes episode one. Most people were so wowed by the special effects they didn't care that it wasn't as good as the originals. Then out comes epidsode two, and let me tell you I was very disapointed. The only notable thing was that they chose a terrifically terrible actor for Skywalker.And now is episode three. The best of the first three? Yes, but that is not saying much. This movie yet again was carried by special effects. The script sucks, the actors suck, and plot is not much better.Mr. Lucas, you suck. It takes a real pervert to have kids murdered in your movie.He once admitted that he wasn't so great at script-writing, and this movie showcases it. Go ahead, buy it, every Star Wars fan should see it, just because it closes out the series, but I was sorely disapointed.	4.0	George Lucas Has Done it Again	2005-08-22	10	1	9

The reason for this is all because he had a Bad Dream.A dream that his girlfriend would die sometime soon in the future. So he joins the darkside in hopes that he will gain the power to save her. This is not a valid reason for him to team up with the Sith. Especially when you consider the fact that the Siths were trying to assassinate Pademe in Episode 2.They tried to blow her up in an aircraft, then they tried to poison her with worms, then they tried to get a tiger to eat her alive!Apparently, Anakin has forgotten all of this ?Besides the above lack of logic, this movie also suffers from lack believability. The 3 main Jedies seem to have ""Superman"" abilities. Being able to leap through the air in one single bound. And recover from injuries that would kill a normal man.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A175O40GGGJNA	"Timothy Robinson ""timrobinson"""	"So the circle is now complete.  Revenge of the Sith is here and we all want to believe it will help us to erase from our memories the tragedies that are the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.  After finally seeing it this weekend, I'd say we have a hit and miss in our hands (yet again).Don't get me wrong with what I'm saying here.  What was intended to be good in Episode III was REALLY good.  I think Lucas wanted to pull off all stops before he leaves his franchise behind.  From the opening sequence of space battles and lightsaber duels to the marvelous-looking worlds, we received a visual masterpiece in this movie and it shows how far ILM has come in terms of digital effects.  And the last 45 minutes was the way Star Wars should have been throughout this whole prequel trilogy what with Yoda giving the Emperor a run for his money, Anakin and Obi-Wan showcasing the peak of their saber skills, and the inevitable transformation to Darth Vader for Anakin, which was well-done minus Vader screaming to the air like he just lost his puppy.  And with Obi-Wan leaving Luke behind on Tatooine, it was the perfect way to end and lead into Episode IV.But sadly, we are still tainted with the things that have plagued this whole trilogy and are why we can never compare this trilogy to the original.  The majority of that goes towards acting.  This is not a knock at the actors, it's a knock at Lucas' handling of the actors and his lack of knowledge on catchy dialogue.  Padme was pretty much reduced to nothing in this film.  All she did was lie around at home and spit stupid lines like, ""That's because I'm so in love"" when Anakin comments on her beauty.  GOSH GEORGE, WHAT DUMB PERSON SAYS SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN REAL LIFE???  Natalie Portman deserved better than this.  Hayden Christiansen was slightly better in this movie, but he still gave the impression of being the whiny brat that didn't get his way, which in turn, made his motivation for turning to the dark side not very convincing.  While I did say his transformation to Vader was well-done, the parts leading up to it just lacked some punch.  And their whole continuing love saga just dragged to the point that all your adrenaline was lost once the first 30 minutes were over.Granted, everyone else did a respectable job.  Palpatine was freaky in this one and just had that charisma that made you know he was gonna cause trouble for the galaxy.  Ewan McGregor once again passes with flying colors, as should be expected with him.  And Yoda is just the man.  Plain and simple.  He was probably the most human ""actor"" of anybody in the flick.  Other than these three, everyone else did their jobs and nothing else.Overall, in concept, this is a movie that ends the whole six-part saga with a bang.  The script was set up very well and the last 45 minutes was a great way to set up the original trilogy.  But when you have clunky dialogue and dreary characters that you just can't get emotionally into, it really affects the execution of this script.  And a friend and I discussed this after Episode II was out that Lucas had a lot to throw in for the last movie in a span of two hours.  And you can tell; everything was rushed in there to make sure we all got everything we wanted.  Some of it worked, some of it didn't.So it is indeed a great summer action flick and it will rack in millions just on its name alone.  But given that Star Wars is embedded into our culture, it deserved to be more than just an action flick.  Very good movie, but not what it should really be."	4.0	Job Well Done,  But Could Have Been So Much More	2005-05-23	8	5	3

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1G7TI5DFRZQX1	"T. Kennedy ""TA FAN"""	"The first two Star Wars prequels don't exist.  They were exceedingly long filler, backstory to set up the most beloved trilogy in the history of cinema.  They introduced the audience to the politics of Lucas's universe, the basis for the Empire's eventual takeover,and all the technical plot twisting that goes along with it.  For a while we got an interesting villain who, if kept throughout the trilogy, could have provided a much needed sense of continuity and spared us the pain of being bombarded with Dooku and Grievous (two of the goofiest, most cliche villains in recent memory).  And through it all we sat willingly through the total destruction of some of our most engimatic movie characters.Enter Episode 3.  This is the payoff.  Finally the story has hit it's stride, and the action has burned its way out of its shell.  The universe is falling apart.  The Galactic Senate is eating itself from the inside out and the Jedi Council is imploding from its own bloated dogma.  Emperor Plapatine reveals his true nature and in doing so becomes, hands down, the most intriguing, most competantly scripted and acted character in the series with the exception of Han Solo.  Ian's delivery is chilling.  The film's most powerful moments here revolve around his presence.  The scene directly following his battle with Mace Windu when he hoods his face and becomes the vision of evil we've grown accustomed to in the original films.  His effortless manipulation of the politicians, in which intellectualism wins out over the outdated hypocrisy of Yoda and the ""force nazis"".  His fatherly moment with the wounded Anakin on the lava planet.  Without Ian's competance the movie would have sputttered and died.The action, for the most part, is pretty incredible.  As are the movie's tensest moments.  Anakin's implied slaughter of the children (""youngings"", ugh) and the military style execution of the Jedi by the Stormtroopers is inspired.  The climax shared by the Yoda-vs-Palpatine and Anakin-vs-Obia Wan battles is probably the most rewarding thing here.  Even the dialogue between Anakin and Obia Wan keeps some dignity, for a time, and the fight is topped off in a way that sent creepy little ice spider crawling down my spine.So what's wrong here?  Lucas.  His ineptitude as a direcetor is awe-inspiring.  It's almost perplexing, in a way, that someone who's undergone so much criticism regarding his writing skills has made no attempt to improve the quality of his finished product.  99% of the dialogue in this film is cringe-worthy.  The scenes between Anakin and Padma are trully painful, and Vader's last Frankenstien moment should have never transpired.  When the helmet is put over Anakin's scarred face, and we hear the apocalyptic ""hooper"" breath of our favorite sith lord - that should have been the end of the prequel series.  But Lucas pillages it's effectiveness, and it's a tragedy.Alas, in the end it's an illusion.  What is happening is wonderful but how it's handled leaves nothing but a sick, empty feeling.  Watching Episode 3 is like witnessing the rough first-draft of what could have been a masterpiece."	3.0	A magnificent skeleton	2005-05-22	3	2	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3CZVZ35U5F96H	T. Kucukyumuk	I have been waiting for this so long. (Yeah I know, so have all the other millions of fans; but this is my review). I criticised Episode 1 for its lack of spirit (and Jar Jar Binks, of course). I hated Hayden Christensen as Anakin in Episode 2 (I still do, a little bit). But now, in this final episode everyhting seems to fall into place (OK, there are still some loopholes, but nobody's perfect). Even Christensen is convincing in the process of giving into the dark side. The effects are spectacular (although I am also getting sick of so much CGI in one movie), just the opening sequence is enough to give you an adrenaline boost (still nothing compares to the speeder chase on Endor). Yes, I could make pages and pages of analysis here. No need, go out and watch it at home on the DVD. Freeze frames when you want to. Watch the deleted scenes (and get angry with Mr. Lucas for cutting out Yoda's landing on Dagobah) and other excellent extra stuff we have come to expect from Lucasfilm DVDs. This is one movie you will watch over and over. I wish they could continue somehow.But I know one thing, as long as Mr. Lucas has his hands over these films, he will continue to play with them (giving us more reasons to hate him) and will create 6-pack special editions of the saga to rip us off every few years. So, puh-lease Mr. Lucas, hands off these ones!	5.0	Arise Lord Vader...	2005-11-24	3	2	1

I had trouble accepting McGregor as Obi-Wan in Phantom Menance and Clone Wars, but he definately proved his worth in Revenge of the Sith.

Ok, this is one gray area, but the rest of the film is superb, and most importantly, Hayden Christensen acts very well in this film, as opposed to his lackluster performance in Attack of the Clones. This film has a little bit of everything: epic lightsaber battles, love, hatred, betrayal, seduction, evil, and heartbreak. The darkest of the prequels, this film is emotionally-charged, in that it spells the end of the Republic, and the events that lead to its destruction. Painful to watch at times, (such as the Order 66 sequence, as well as Anakin burning), Revenge of the Sith nevertheless brings the viewer to the edge of their seat while actually knowing what will ultimately transpire in the end. Yes, Anakin will survive and become Darth Vader in a suit, and Padme will die of a broken heart. On the other hand, Windu's death and the ""making"" of the Emperor's face wasn't well-known before the release of this film. As usual, the CGI backgrounds and environments are superb, and there is memorable dialogue, such as ""Take a seat, young Skywalker"", or ""In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you're under arrest, Chancellor.""

However , I'm a huge fan of the original three. The only appeal of the latest film ( Revenge of the Sith ) , was to see how Anniken turned to the dark side. And also this is the film that would connect two generations of fans. The sheer knowledge, that all of the original players ( R2D2,C3PO,Yoda,and Chewbacca) were in this one, was too nestalgic to pass up. Too bad, they all had limited cameos. All except,(over-computerized )Yoda. He was featured alot . "" Episode 3 "" , was a decent movie. It had certain redundent elements and twists. It didn't rely on too much cgi. I greatly appreciated that. The acting, was okay and somewhat nonchalant. Aside from Samuel Jackson ( Mace Windu ) and Ian McDairmid ( Chancellor Palpatine ) , there weren't many actors that were committed to their charactors as they were to spewing out atrocious one liners. Atleast , that's how it seemed to me. The action scenes were alright. Some of it was obviously catering to younger audiences. And some of the action sequences, that involved vivid violence and dismemberment, catered to the "" faces of death"" crowd. So be aware of that, when you send your kid, to check out this movie. Yesterday's creative filmakers have replaced puppet magic with blatant violent imagery.So much for ingenious groundbreaking , technology. I wasn't terribly impressed. I wasn't terribly dissappointed.It didn't move me, at all. The script was enemic and mediocre. No surprises whatsoever.I didn't appreciate that, either. I understand that "" Revenge of the Sith "" ,leads into another film ( Star Wars- A new beginning ). But there could've been some new revelations and twists. Amazingly , I was mostly dissappointed in the Darth Vader , introduction. He was such a mysterious and dangerous villian , in the original series. Honestly, it was uncomfortable , to see the emotional side , behind the mask. Was I the only one who felt weird, hearing Darth Vader scream "" Noooo ! "". I understand his pain about the wife thing...but just wanting to be on the dark side was enough for me to justify his evilness. That, took the film to a dissappionting level , personally. Darth Vador's entire aura was destroyed for me. I basically believe that George Lucas, thought, that big-named hollywood stars would make these prequel films , exceed, beyond their anemic scripts. Ironically , it worked ! Atleast, in a monotary sense. But I'm not impressed. And I don't think that any fan of the original films , will be either. Luckily , I can look at the originals ( Star Wars , The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi) and ignore the prequel films. If Lucas couldn't do any better with the Star Wars series , than this. I definately don't look forward to seeing his new ""Indiana Jones"" , film. Overall , I was optomistic and curious walking into the theatre but I walked out of "" Revenge of the Sith "" , feeling more scarred by the stars than amazed by the wars.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A233QN6P2EEKPS	Tom Collier	When looking through the abundance of mostly positive reviews for Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, it is impossible not to detect a common theme amongst the vast majority of film critics. The final film of the Star Wars series is widely praised for its special effects and action sequences, while the atrocious dialogue and story is regarded as inconsequential. After all, these critics ask, who goes to a Star Wars film for the dialogue or for the story?It is stunning how many of these genuine experts on film manage to completely miss the point. While easy to dismiss the original three films as flighty fantasy, they are so much more than that. They are riveting tales of heroism, villainy, imagination, adventure, and redemption. To dismiss the story of the original films as unimportant and weightless is utterly ridiculous, with an apparent willingness to ignore that the series would hardly be the most famous in the history of cinema if the story around it was garbage. The original films at their lowest were still fantastic.The lack of a great story and the disregard for good dialogue is why Revenge of the Sith, while easily the best of the prequel films and a solid film overall, fails to reach the level of fantasy nirvana the original films achieved. Granted, Revenge of the Sith has a few exciting and even touching moments. It also contains an impressive number of action sequences, as many as any other two of the Star Wars films combined. Even for a jaded cynic, it would be difficult not to be impressed by the four lightsaber wielding cyborg villain, or the delightfully creative way in which Yoda and the evil Emperor duel in the massive Senate chamber. The peak of the film is also the key moment of the prequels, when the now evil Anakin Skywalker battles Obi-Wan Kenobi on a terrifying volcanic planet going into meltdown.But a staggeringly bad feeling perpetuates even these high-points, when you realize you that you don't care about the characters because of the prequel films, but because of their roles in the classic trilogy. Really, what has the whiny and annoying Anakin Skywalker done in the most recent two films to earn any sympathy from us at all? Where was the offbeat charm that made the wise Jedi Master Yoda steal all of his scenes in The Empire Strikes Back? Without something to care about, all of the lightsaber battles creator George Lucas can throw at us only amount to colorful but pointless noise. The only performance that adds anything new to the original characters is Ian  McDiarmid's vile Emperor Palpatine,  who adds a fiendishly wicked undertone to all of his lines.As any actor other than McDiarmid speaks his lines, it is impossible not to shake your head in disgust at George Lucas' direction. Ewan McGregor, Hayden Christiansen, Samuel L. Jackson, and all the rest have proven themselves as competent and even skillful film actors in their numerous other works. However, whenever the actors speak, they sound as if Lucas told them to phonetically pronounce every word in the script, and to leave out any and all emphasis unless they are screaming the name of another character. The stilted dialogue does not do much for the computerized scenery, which varies wildly in quality. Scenes such as the opening space battle and the volcanic world look amazing, while settings such as the Emperor's office are drenched in CGI overkill. It's as if Lucas decided that since the audience knows the locations are fake, then they mise as well not even try to make many of the effects look real. When compared to the brilliant and weighty set design of the first three films, it is obvious that the decision to populate nearly every frame with CGI is a huge mistake.Leaving the theater is a sad experience. Despite all of its flaws, Revenge of the Sith is still a Star Wars movie, and the better moments of the film beg you to love it. The heart may want what it wants, but the head is still there. Lucas may manage not to wreck the train, but as Yoda might say, saved the prequel trilogy he has not.	3.0	Decent end to amazing series	2005-10-30	27	20	7

The final installment, and by far the darkest, of the Star Wars films. One movie, 6 parts, 13 hrs. Many may hate this, but I, unlike the poser Star Wars fans, enjoy what Lucas did. ""After three long years of relentless fighting, the Clone Wars are nearly at an end. The Jedi Council dispatches Obi-Wan Kenobi to bring General Grievous, the deadly leader of the Separatist droid army, to justice. Meanwhile, back on Coruscant, Chancellor Palpatine has grown in power. His sweeping political changes transform the war-weary Republic into the mighty Galactic Empire. To his closest ally, Anakin Skywalker, he reveals the true nature of power and the promised secrets of the Force in an attempt to lure him to the dark side."" Anakin Skywalker's journey to the dark side of the Force lends Revenge of the Sith a darker, more tragic tone than any of the other movies in the Star Wars saga. For the actors who inhabit the characters, that meant the opportunity to bring a new level of sophistication and nuance to their performances. Some dialogue is a little flismy, and yes some acting, but nowhere near as much as many would say. The effects are incredible, and the final shots are breath taking and jaw dropping. They are among the most powerful shoits in cinema history! The lightsaber duels have never been this intense! In the end, evil triumphs.

The only thing I know about this whole series is ""Luke, I'm your father"" and that everyone wishes Jar Jar Binks deserves to die a horrible, screaming, pus-filled death. But I can honestly say after seeing this, I might go out and watch the remaining installments.  From what I've read in reviews and what people have told me, I've been able to put some of the pieces together. After hearing that Anakin turns into Darth Vader in this movie, I thought he would be just plain evil. To me, it seems like turning to the dark side was actually an honorable thing to do, he didn't like how the Jedi was handling their business. And I'm pretty sure Laya and Luke are brother and sister?? R2D2 was pretty damn funny too.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A7LL11KVEYFYA	"Too Right ""You On"""	"After seeing this film in the theater I remarked that I had three problems with it.  ( One of these happens to be the usual problem that virtually everybody has with the film, but I'm not going to talk about THAT because I see it differently now. )As far as the other things...I do feel that Grievous was mishandled, but I can actually enjoy his battle scene with Obi-Wan on the DVD.  The problem with Grievous, IMHO, is that he's a poorly-conceived character.  I find it amazing that we don't even get to see him killing a ""scrub"" Jedi character ( in Trek ""crewman newman"" fashion ) so as to demonstrate his presumed lethality.  In other words, Grievous suffers from the same problem seen with the JK droids in the book THE CESTUS DECEPTION.  We're supposed to believe that this thing could kill Jedi, WHILE BEING GIVEN NO EVIDENCE TO THAT EFFECT.Why would a lone non-Force-user have any chance against a Jedi in the first place?  At least the film does the logical thing (!) and has Obi-Wan use a Force Push on him.  And the final part of the Clone Wars cartoon ""explains"" why Grievous seems so weak, as John Knoll ( not Lucas, notably ) points out in the commentary.Speaking of the commentary, there's some interesting stuff in there.  This has given rise to net discussions on the topic ""Is Rick McCallum canon?""  Hee hee.....I'm not sure if anything in the first 30 min. of the movie makes sense, with the exception of the Dooku fight.  Remember, just keep telling yourself: Palpatine is controlling everything.  If you want to see ""canonical"" Star Wars tech issues discussed in the context of the Battle of Coruscant, you're going to have to read LABYRINTH OF EVIL or possibly check the OS.For me, the other big weakness of this movie could be described as ""not enough Kashyyyk"".  Why have Chewbacca in the film at all if he's going to mostly just stand around?  We don't even get to see him fire his weapon!  The only memorable action he performs is to give Yoda ( actually a sack of flour ) a ride on his back.The original concept for Kashyyyk was much like Endor.  Lucas doesn't want to be accused of ripping off the Ewok village for another film, even though the structure of ROTJ's ending was re-used for The Phantom Menace.  What we really need is to have all the Ewoks digitally edited out of ROTJ and replaced with Wookiees!On the other hand, the only Kashyyyk scene that was in the script but not in the film was really stupid and needed to be dropped ( I'm talking to you, ""crazy Yoda"" ).  Actually, a piece left over from that scene is still in the film ...I think this film vindicates Christensen and is in some ways the best film in the series since TESB.  It does leave a lot for the viewers to figure out for themselves.  Keep in mind that Lucas was restrained not only by his self-imposed need to keep all the films in the series around the same length and similar in cinematography, but also by the necessity to keep it under an R rating.  If we could've had an R rating, we could've seen a much crazier Order 66, something like the last 20 min. of The Last Samurai.  Such as a few Jedi completely ****ed up by blaster bolts but STILL FIGHTING.The DVD's transfer is flawed.  It seems that people are generally kind of apathetic about it, because they know we're all going to be buying these movies again in a few years anyway.  I'll say this: if episodes III, IV, V, and VI aren't FIXED in the complete-saga release, then ( in the words of Owen Lars ) ""there'll be hell to pay"".If you have an XBox try the Battlefront II demo.  The text on the back of the DVD advertising ""two complete levels"" is a tad misleading - you get a set time limit to get as far in each level as you can.  The Utapau level is actually winnable!  The chain gun troopers ( ""Clone Commanders"" ), so effective in the film against Ki-Adi-Mundi, are very useful here.  When you get to the point in these two levels where you need to blow up some kind of machine, don't use your regular blaster.  In the Utapau level use the Republic tank, it's a Pandemic game after all.  Use the Clone Pilot in the space teaser, because that character has a mine which can take out the objective ( the clone marine just has grenades, which are less effective ).In the space teaser level, you can fly an ARC-170, a V-Wing ( weak ), or a Jedi fighter; once you land in the Separatist ship, you can experiment with flying a Vulture droid, a tri-fighter, or the thing Obi-Wan used to leave Utapau, referred to in the script as Grievous' starfighter ( here it's a bomber ).This disc was made in Mexico."	4.0	Revenge of the Haters	2005-11-10	7	3	4

But as soon as I pressed play, I loved every bit of it.

I enjoyed the films, except for Attack Of The Clones. Having seen the originals and the first two prequels, I eventually got around to checking out this last one, and WOW, it changed my whole outlook.I cannot believe how impressed I was with this film, how well the writers wrapped up the whole saga and put all the pieces together. This was an excellent film, the best of the entire series. I'm writing this review years after seeing &#34;Sith.&#34; so it's just a few general thoughts. I remember thinking, after watching the wild opening, that this was going to be another one of the modern-day action films with too much action....but it settled down and wasn't vastly overdone in that area, although it could have toned it down a bit.Better than the action or special effects was simply the way the writers tied everything up, how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader, and his son wound up being the hero &#34;Luke&#34; that we saw in those early episodes of the 1970s and 1980s. The special effects were, of course, top-notch. When you go back and see those early films you really see how far Hollywood has advanced in this area. I cannot imagine how many hours of work it took the put these storyboards and computer artwork in this film, there is so much detail. It's mind-boggling.I know a lot of fans of this series feared the writers would mess up the final but their fears were not realized: this was a super ending to a memorable saga that endured for almost 30 years.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A5CWLQF6QO3CN	"Tso Haven Hei Wan ""Havenough Dupont Randall-B..."	Long ago there was a galaxy far far away that struck our hearts and mind and became the all time classic that rules across generations like the Galactic Empire. Now in Revenge of the Sith we witnessed the formation of the Galactic Empire and the downfall of the Jedi.The last instalment to the multiepisode saga of Star Wars finally hit the theatres today. Anakin Skywalker's downfall to Darth Vader is realised and it's time to say bye to Yoda and Obi-wen. In this final instalment, George Lucas managed to patch up most of his over confidence errors in the last two movies and made a decent end to the prequel trilogy. The acting is less wooden and obviously there is a lot more for the actors to act. Nonetheless, none of the actors could be seen at their prime performances. Cheesy and corny dialogues taxed the believability of the emotions of the character a lot, making them less connected to the audience as they should be in this dramatic end to the prequels. Yoda still rules and he fought more but the opening R2-D2 scene stole a lot of glory from its counterparts and we could actually see the good old R2-D2 we used to see in the original trilogy.Action wise, the movie is packed with quick actions and lots of fighting scenes. Battles and wars are the themes so you won't miss out any. The transition for character emotions are much better dealt with, though demerited by the poorly written dialogues from time to time. A lot of correlations were being put into this movie to tie itself into the original trilogy. Nonetheless, sometimes it did it in such an obvious way that it made the whole thing looked awkward. In the music department, not many tunes are really ear catching as in Episode I and Episode II but you sure could hear an amalgamation of tunes across the other 5 episodes. The best part of the movie is the cinematography that depicts different landscape and worlds in great details and differences. Still some scenes tried too hard to remind people of the old trilogy, especially the Tatooine part. Also there is a major conflict in the story plot that didn't agree with part of the story in Return of the Jedi, but since it is a spoiler, I won't mention it here.In all, Revenge of the Sith lived up to the not as great expectation and did put the series to a good rest for all the Star Wars fans, disappointed or not throughout the years.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	"It's a very rare film. All of us know the film's ending as well as the story before we see it, and we are sure that it's going to be a big hit, which it actually turned out.  Our real concern is, is it worth that?  My opinion is Yes, but with some reservations.I don't write the story.  I only say that 'Episode III' is easily the best of the new trilogy.  Finally, George Lucas understood that we need actions, not laughs; we need Obi-Wan and Darth Vader, not the talking lizard.  He at last seems to have regained the filmmaking skills he had in the 70s.  But it took so long, or I am afraid, too long.Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen are good (if not great) as Obi-Wan and Anakin.  Both actors show more convincing images of the characters than in 'Episode II,' but with more tact to deliver the dialogues, the love-hate relations between Obi-Wan and Anakin would be more emotionally charged.  Much better are two veterans Ian McDiarmid as Chancellor and Christopher Lee as Count Dooku.  Compared with the charisma of living legend Lee, even Samuel L. Jackson fades away.  I need the Count more.Oh, and Padm&eacute;?  Natalie Portman (or her character as Anakins's love) is the weakest of the film.  You cannot blame her for the poorly-written dialogues she must do anyway.  Everytime I see her in this new trilogy, I remember how sensational she was in Luc Besson's 'Professional.'  Her talent is undeniable now, but not in this film.  As far as the romance goes, the best moment of the 'Star Wars' saga remains the scene of 'Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back,' in which Princess Leia says to Han Solo ""I love you.""  No one would disagree.Watch the final entry of the new saga for the spectacular CGIs.  To wrap up the whole story, Lucas hurries in the second half, and you see many plot holes and incredible coincidences.  Still the film is action-packed, and the final fight between Obi-Wan on the raft floating on the lava is exciting."	4.0	For All Its Not-So-Good Romance Part, This Action-Packed Film Is the Best of the New Trilogy	2005-09-18	9	5	4
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2G8IR6ENZSQHF	"T. Tiraterra ""Fluffy"""	"If you've been paying attention at all the last four weeks, you've probably heard the good buzz surrounding Episode III.  Indeed, this review is rather pointless for me to write, but hey, it's fun to do so anyways.  Needless to say, everyone else is right- this is easily the best film of the prequel trilogy, and is worth a spin for any casual ""Star Wars"" fan.  Now for a more detailed analysis.""Revenge of the Sith"" is a powerful and engrossing film- in its final hour, that is.  Unfortunately, you have to trudge through an hour of a slow pace and some awkward scenes in order to get there.Of course, there is much to praise in the film's set-up.  For one, we finally get to see some of that rumoured friendship between Anakin Skywalker and Obiwon Kenobi (In Episode I, the two barely interacted, and in Episode II, Obiwon was obviously a stern and distant mentor.  This had us wondering what Obiwon was talking about when he said him and Anakin were ""good friends"" in Episode IV).  Also, the 20-minute battle sequence that opens the film is quite good.However...The romance between Anakin and Padme is still as forced as ever, and my roomate and I still get a kick out of quoting all of its painfully bad lines.  This is an unfortunate detriment to the otherwise solid film, since it renders one aspect of the climax (the deterioration of their relationship) less moving than it should be.  Also, there are times in the first hour when Episode III feels dangerously close to Episode II, with all the talking heads and political banter (although, to be fair, I wasn't as bored here as I was with the first hour of Episode II).Once Palpatine is revealed to be a Sith Lord, all hell breaks loose, and Episode III comes to life and never lets up.  The action in the climax is suitably dark and rousing, and there are a couple of genuinely unsettling scenes.  Knowing the inevitable fate of all the characters makes it all that much more tragic.  The film ends on the right note of despair and a faint glint of hope.The acting is much improved here overall.  I always suspected that Ewan McGregor could be a good Obiwon, and he finally pulls it off here.  The best performance belongs to Ian McDirmand, who is subtling menacing in the film's first half and then goes other the top in its second.  I initially blamed the failure of Episode II on Hayden Christensen, but then retracted and said that he showed hints of being a good actor.  My second interpretation was correct, as he is suitable as Anakin here.  This is not an Oscar performance, but it gets the job done.  Natalie Portman is the only sore spot- as pretty as she is, she has never been able to make Padme a convinving character.  Is it the fault of her or Lucas?  It's true that Lucas is a bad writer, but Portman at times looked like she was sleepwalking through these films.So, was the prequel trilogy worth it?  I don't know.  After all, the success of Episode III does not magically fix the flaws of I and II.  One gets the sense that these three could have been condensed into two better films.  Even Episode III has some major plot problems (see The Best Page in the Universe for details of that) that many fans think detract from it (though I don't).  However, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a suitable way for the film franchise to go out.  It is action-packed, occasionally moving, and basically just a good time to spend at the theater."	4.0	OK, I give in...Lucas finally made a good one	2005-06-11	8	5	3

REVENGE OF THE SITH takes place two to three years after ATTACK OF THE CLONES ended. The Republic is in an all out war against the Separatist Forces. The movie opens in the usual STAR WARS way, explaining that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine has been kidnapped from his quarters in Corsucant and that the individuals responsible for the crime, Count Dooku and General Grievous, are on the verge of escaping with their victim. An elite two man task force, consisting of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker have been dispatched to rescue the Chancellor before the Separatist leaders are able to escape.This opening scene to the film is quite spectacular to watch. However, it's really too much. Every square inch of the screen is filled with detail, so much detail that though it looks lifelike, a person just knows it's too real to be true.However, despite the hyperbolic visuals, REVENGE OF THE SITH is the best of the prequal STAR WARS films. Most of the gaps between this film and the beginning of STAR WARS are filled in. Long awaited parts of the tale that, until now, have never really been explained are finally revealed (how did Padme die, for instance). Some old characters from the original trilogy make cameo appearances (Chewbacca, the Millenium Falcoln) and other characters are more fleshed out.Yet, in the fourth STAR WARS film he directed, George Lucas has proved once again that he just can't write an ounce of good dialogue. The Star Wars movies have always been prone to cheesy lines because the films are basically space Westerns. Yet, Lucas had people who wrote for him that actually could write decent dialogue. That isn't the case in REVENGE OF THE SITH.Nevertheless, REVENGE OF THE SITH is a fairly decent sci-fi adventure picture that everyone can at least somewhat enjoy. Kids will adore it and STAR WARS fans will find it to be the film that Lucas should have made back in 1998.	5.0	Fills in the Gaps	2005-09-01	1	1	0

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	ALENO9ZKHAK4W	Ulven	"I'm not as critical of the latest three of the Star Wars series as some. They inspire me in a similar way to the original three. So many films based on icons, like James Bond, Batman and Spiderman, really do not provide me the 'aura' of the character that the original creations introduced. But Star Wars distinctly feels like Star Wars. I really credit these latest three episodes for succeeding at this. But there are short-comings.I loved the first 40-45 minutes of this film. It really did capture my imagination. But unfortunately, the film-makers weren't up to the admittedly difficult task of the Annikin-to-Darth Vader transition.Throughout the last three episodes, the psychological issues were not convincing. I found many of the apparently good characters to be more unlikable than the bad characters. Yoda, O-B-1 Kenobey (spelling?), and Samuel L. Jackson's character, were a bit overbearing at times with their 'wisdom'. And though a plausable story behind why Annikin turned evil may have been outlined, the detail faultered, therefore made it too simplistic and weak. The acting also didn't quite live up to the darkness needed for the roles. Some of the important scenes felt very rushed. (Though in fairness, acting infront of a blank blue screen can't be as motivating as the scenery we see on the cinema screen).One positive about this film, was that the love scenes and personal scenes between Annikin and Amidala were kept brief. In Attack of the Clones, a couple of personal scenes were too long.I wasn't fond of the scenery toward the end of the film, either. The imitation hell was a bit too obvious, for a start, and artistically, wasn't very inspired.The portrayal of evil, in general, in this film, was superficial. Way too ""this is what evil looks like"". The evil vs good was paint-by-numbers, especially a scene where Annikin/Darth Vader was to have apparently killed children. It felt like a cheap tug at the heart strings. 1 + 1 = 2, kill + children = evil. A bit artificial. I don't think the filmmakers mustered enough depth to handle the case.Where the original Star Wars films succeeded, is that they didn't try too hard to address the driving forces of evil. They didn't play the morality hand especially hard, so it was easy to just let the situations unfold. But the later three in the series talked too much psychology and politics, but didn't have the depth to pull it off. So, it did distract from the occurances playing themselves out. This one was the only one that disappointed me, whereas the previous two didn't. But still, definitely worth seeing at the cinema.If you put aside some of the negatives, you can still get taken away by the eventual development of Annikin into Darth Vader, and the rest of the themes.There were plenty of positives, but I give it 2.5*, my lowest rating for any of the Star Wars films. But I'd not be surprised if others like this more than the previous two. It's not a given that this one is weaker, but it did have more holes in the character and scene developments.Most importantly though, it still retained the trademark 'feel' of Star Wars, as opposed to feeling like just another science-fiction film."	3.0	Fails to live up to the climax of Darth Vader's birth.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2OCJNB6B46OKP	"Underground Reborn ""gnome"""	It took George Lucas almost 30 years to finally answer the question that plagued millions upon millions of fans ever since 1980. How did Anakin Skywalker become the ruthless Darth Vader? Now in `Revenge Of The Sith' we all sit back (for some moments reluctantly) and watch as the frustrated young Jedi turns to the ways of darkness.`Revenge Of The Sith' in my eyes is by far the best installment of the entire `Star Wars' Saga. Not because is gives me closure, not because Jar Jar Binks didn't say a word or any of the other typical answers the fans give. I love this episode because George Lucas went further than he ever went to create one extremely emotional film. There are those including myself who actually shed a tear when Anakin is seen slaughtering Jedi...and even though you never see him kill the younglings you still get a sharp stabbing pain in your heart knowing he did. Also when the Jedi fall to the clones, Yoda places himself in exile and Obi-Wan expressing his true feelings for his fallen friend you just don't see that in the other movies. The fights in this film are by far the most exciting because of the causes they are being fought over. I first heard about the fabled Obi-Wan Anakin fight over lava when I was 14...but never did I expect at age 23 that the fight and the amazing score to be so powerful and emotional...it truly kept me on the edge of my seat. If this movie should be nominated for any Oscar it should be for the scoreOnce you see this movie it will only make you want to pull out the original trilogy just to put that little light of hope back in your system after going through 2 and half hours of darkness. The ending also brings back that feeling you first had when the flagship soars right onto the screen in the opening of `A New Hope.' The minute you see Luke being delivered to his family you can't help but remember the feeling of reaching for the stars when Luke 17 years later will be seen staring at the Binary sunset in the sands of Tatooine. For Lucas and many hard core fanatics this may be the end...but for me after seeing this film all I can say is the battle may be over...but the true war is just beginning.	5.0	The True War Is Just Begining...	2005-06-03	1	1	0

Now you can talk about Batman Begins and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory all you want- but Revenge of the Sith will be the blockbuster and the #1 summer movie of 2005 and could beat Titanic's box office record of 16 weeks at #1.  A record that has gone unmatched since December 19, 1997.Revenge of the Sith is a fitting and appropriate conclusion to one of the most successful movie franchies in history.  Batman Begins just won't measure to Revenge of the Sith.For years, I have wondered how Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader and in this new movie, Revenge of the Sith, we will finally see how Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader.  After what happened to mother in Attack of the Clones, who can blame for killing the Sand People and who can blame him for killing Dooku after what he tried to do to Amidala in the mock trials and non-executions.  We will finally see Palpatine become the Emperor.The movie begins with Anakin and Obi-Wan on a rescue mission, to rescue the Supreme Chancellor and we know that Palpatine is Anakin's strongest supporter and when the Jedi Council assigns Anakin to spy on the Chancellor and essentially betray him- it is Anakin who betrays the Jedi Council and with Anakin denied the rank of Jedi Master after proving himself time and time again- his anger is encouraged and his rage is focused on the Jedi knights and the Jedi Council.We will see Obi-Wan and Greivous in a battle and then the most anticipated lightsaber duel between Obi-Wan and Anakin will take place on a planet entirely made of lava- George Lucs shows us his vision of hell and he will show us what happens when Anakin makes a deal with the devil.Anakin makes his turn to the dark side after his true love, Amidala dies.Yoda will run to Dagobah after a battle with the Emperor and after defeating Anakin, Obi-Wan runs to Tatoonie.I think it is clear that Obi-Wan defeats Anakin- because how else could he become Vader- if he didn't lose to Obi-Wan.This movie is the must-see movie of 2005 and the darkside looks cool.  This movie finally shows us how Anakin becomes Vader.	5.0	Revenge of the Sith is the summer blockbuster!!	2005-03-01	12	4	8

A New Hope and the Empire Strikes Back stand in contrast, rather than in companion with the SW movies that have come since.  Star Wars was inexplicably dumbed-down for Return of the Jedi and hasn't had even a glimpse of regaining it's intellect.  The prequels, while offering great imagery, are so vacant on story and personality that the rabidly interested audience struggles to get even peripherally involved when watching.  We struggle to find anyone to even like.  Suspending our disbelief has become a full-time chore.If SW III is to be successful, it will have to recapture the serious nature, and emphasis on character driven storytelling that existed in the beginning.  The fact that TPM and AOTC have been commerical successes all but ensures the ultimate disappointment for true fans of Star Wars when the the final Prequel hits the screen.	3.0	Does Lucas even know the odds?	2004-09-29	11	4	7

I am not a Star Wars fan, but have seen every movie. Well, even I shocked myself when I found myself liking this movie. Yes its a bit long and the dialogue is still somewhat cheesy. However, the acting definitely improved over the last film. Even Hayden Christensen was much better. I liked the darker tones of the film. I actually felt some emotion towards the characters. The last battle between Anakin and Obi-wan was enjoyable and even emotional. I actually felt sadness for them both. When Obi-wan tells Anakin that he was like a brother to him, I totally believed it. It was a rare poignant moment in Star Wars history. I even felt bad for the corrupted Anakin. I thought it ended well too, despite the scene with the scream heard round the world...

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1NDYL6D6QNVCI	"Valnastar ""Man With No Name"""	"I saw Star Wars III on opening day. It was certainly the best of the three Star Wars prequels, although I wouldn't go as far as a small number of reviewers saying it's better than some of the originals with Mark Hamill nor would I side with the other extreme calling the picture a total disaster. The original three pictures are still better films overall, with more emotional content, more coherent story, tighter direction, sharper scripting, etc. Nevertheless, this new Star Wars episode nicely answers all the odd little questions asked about nearly everything you can think of since Episode I came out and of course it answers many major questions pondered by fans for more than 20 years since Star Wars first became a world-wide phenomena. Episode III is certainly exciting, paced better, and better acted in many spots than the last two pictures, although the brief scenes between Anakin and Padme are still a bit stiffer than one would like and stand in annoying contrast to the excitement and emotion of the rest of the picture. However, George Lucas actually let his young actors show some emotion in this one and performances are far less stiff than in Episode II.Of course, Episode III is visually stunning and incredibly creative and exciting, but those were the things that saved Episode I and Episode II from being total cinematic disasters, the action and visual imagery often compensating somewhat for the lack of emotional content and character interplay. In this case, the visual imagery is supported by stronger focus on the main characters and the emotional interplay between them, making it at least closer to the magic of the original Star Wars films than Episode I or Episode II. Ewan McGregor, Ian McDarmid, Frank Oz and most of the rest of the cast turn in terrific performances that bolster the drama of the picture. The lightsaber duels, of which there are many, provide massive amounts of swashbuckling action.This picture does not quite achieve the artistic level of the original Star Wars trilogy, where good acting and tight scripting brought fans to the point where they cared deeply about the relationships between Luke, Leia, Han, Obi-Wan and even the droids through three entire films, but it certainly is highly enjoyable and for the most part, well-made and well-acted. The ""buddy-picture"" parts of Episode III, which allow the audience to see Obi-Wan and Anakin facing danger together as true friends, is the kind of emotional interplay fans have longed for and that was sorely missed in the last two episodes. Thankfully, Episode III delivers some real story, real emotion and real character development and most fans will enjoy it a lot. It may even excite you enough that you'll want to go home and watch the videos of the original trilogy immediately after.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3HMCXAWLTGDRF	"Vanessa Rosenkranz ""movie geek89"""	To sum this movie up, I have used a familiar phrase quoted by this trilogy's  hero now turned villian. I want to put all this crap about this installment to bed. Revenge of the Sith is a great movie and is arguably the third best of the entire Star Wars Trilogy.I have read about the how the acting is of poor quality and that George Lucas was poor at directing this film. Well that's only half true. While George was partially a director when he did A New Hope, he is not what I call a legend as a director. He only told a story that became one of Cinema's greatest achievements. However, the acting was spot on in this film. It seemed like every actor/actress wanted to really show why they signed on to be in this trilogy and become a part of history in the making. Hayden was superb this time around as Anakin and his dedication to playing a superb villian during his conversion period that will have everyone tearing up. Ewan McGregor has finally revealed what nine years in Alec Guinness' footsteps has showed him now that he is playing Obi-Wan with so much interest and excitement from the audience now that they're seeing the Obi-Wan that lost his pupil to the dark side. I feel really bad for Natalie Portman who was neglected for majority of the film, but she was superb when it counted such as Padme's discovery about Anakin's betrayal. Most of all is Ian McDiarmid's performance as the Emperor. He really showed what he could do once he was given a main character role in this film that he completely dwarfed his performance in Return of the Jedi.To look at the technical values of this film, everything was just perfect. The planets were great and Mustafar was so well conceived that I was blown away while watching Anakin and Obi-Wan fight. I also thought that Grievous was an excellent idea, only it was too bad they didn't do as much with him as they did in the animated Clone Wars. Best of all is John William's Score to this film, which hasn't received much attention from many reviewers so far. It is excellent especially when you hear some of the original scores such as Leia's Theme and of course The Binary Sunset at the end of the film. But the new music is incredible, Battle of the Heroes beats out Duel of Fates any day and the rest of the music really adds emotional support to every scene that ultimately leads to Anakin's betrayal.I think George finally understood that when you finish a popular series, you need to remind the audience why the series has stood the test of time. Every scene in the end makes us connect the story to what's to come in A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back and at the very end leaves us feeling all nostalgic.It is insulting that the Academy Awards made this the only Star Wars film that didn't get nominated for Best Visual Effects, let alone some other technical awards and maybe an acting nod for McDiarmid. All the same though, this is a terrific movie and it will be coveted along with the rest of my collection. It was a terrific experience to see each Star Wars film in theaters since there is no other experience like a movie that takes you to A Galaxy Far Far Away....	5.0	"""The Force Is Strong With This One"""	2007-10-10	2	2	0

""Your Father wanted you to have this when you are where old enough."" So this means in Episode 3 Anakin should know that he is going to be a father before he turns to the Dark Side. Some will say well then he would tell the Emperor and Vader would go kill them but remember the Dark Side clouds your mind. So he could forget until later.Episode 6When Luke asks Leia if she remembers her mother, Leia said. ""Not much, she died when I was very young. She was beautiful, but sad."" This means that Padme must go with Bail Organa and Leia to Alderean after Luke and Leia are born and she probably dies when Leia is 3 or 4.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A18T26PLZD4SRJ	Vic	Children will love the much tighter, action-packed final installment of the Star Wars series of films. This film is thefinal bridge between the prequel and the 'classic' Star Wars franchises. We learn in this film what drove a talented and ambitious young Jedi to side with the dark lords of the Sith and betray his jedi friends, and eventually lose his humanity in the cold exterior of his new alter-ego Darth Vader. Lucas has trimmed most of the politics out of this film, lots of effects and action here, and greater news, no Jar-Jar binks dialogue, only a brief visual appearance. For the uninitiated, Jar Jar was a creature created in Star Wars Episode One that was widely hated for being awkward, talking funny, and generally mucking up the action sequences. I will say this film is much better than the two films preceding it, but this whole prequel series can't touch the original Star Wars series, why, the humanity. In Revenge of the Sith, Lucas again shows his glaring weakness in writing dialogue that makes sense. He can create great worlds and fancy effects and elaborate creatures and sets, but he can't write two sentences that a man and woman in love would actually say to each other. The romance comes off as fake and the acting wooden, even though the actors and actresses are great in their own right. They are just reading what they are given. Children won't care, but adults will roll their eyes at the lack of emotion displayed between two people that are suppose to be in love, and the corny dialogue. The original Star Wars had that great human chemistry between Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford, and the effects were just the background of the story. In all the prequels including this one, the effects are the story and the human characters take a backseat, it's a shame. Every loose end is tied up in here, as Lucas went out of his way to link this series of films to the original Star Warsseries, almost too obviously, you'll see what I mean. I walked out of 'Revenge of the Sith' when the film ended having seen exactly what I thought I would, but is that a good thing?....	4.0	The effects are outstanding..The dialogue will not impress..	2005-05-28	2	1	1
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	AA3UC0F9XD4Y2	"VICTOR   ISENGUARD ""VLADIMUS"""	"Well in my opinion I liked ""REVENGE OF THE SITH"". It has the most lightsaber battles of any of the star wars movies,it is the darkest movie of the series but still maintains some humor,and we finally get to see the birth of DARTH VADER (EVEN IF IT IS ONLY FOR THE LAST FIVE MINUTES OF THE MOVIE). I watched the first two episodes before I went to see episodeIII. Then I watched the original trilogy to see how things matched up with the whole series and here is what I came to realize.1) The medi-chlorians were used by a SITH to create ANAKINbecause as his mother says in episode I  ""There was no father""and when we get to episodeIII Palpatine says ""That the SITH can be become so powerful that they can use the medi-chlorians to create life.""2) The Trade federation were pawns used by PALPATINE/SIDIOUS to start a war that would distract the JEDI. And make them unable to use the force to see that the SITH were in control.Just as the opening scroll explains that ""Evil is Everywhere""what is more evil then War itself.That is why YODA explained to OBI-WAN that the victory they had in episodeII (THE BATTLE ON GEONOSIS)was not a victory, but catalyst to begin a WAR that would cloud everything to them. And once PALPATINE had control over ANAKIN he would then eliminate the rest of the JEDI and do away with the TRADE FEDERATION and THE SEPRATISTS.3) COUNT DOOKU/DARTH TYRANNUS played a distinctive part in the creation of the clone army.As it was he who killed SYFO-DYAS(WhoI actually thought was SIDIOUS just said differently)and used his name and employed the service of JANGO FETT as the main hostfor the clone army.DOOKU also erased all information regarding KAMINO from the jedi archives,seeing that he himself was once a JEDI and as YODA pointed out that only a JEDI could erase files from the jedi archives.And to be honest, I would not trust a clone that was a copy of a BOUNTY HUNTER.4)ANAKIN'S turn to the darkside is throughout all three of the STAR WARS prequel film's. As his childhood starts out as a slave.He is afraid of what will happen to his mother since now he is training to be a JEDI ,and JEDI have no FEAR .Then he lives a lie by falling in love and marrying PADME,which is against the code of the JEDI.And he slaughters a whole village of TUSKEN RAIDERS (AKA SANDPEOPLE) to get revenge for the loss of his mother,which we know REVENGE is not a JEDI trait. By the time we get to episodeIII ANAKIN has already not been totally dedicatedto the JEDI way of life and from here on in it just gets worse!As the JEDI don't trust him with anything,THE JEDI want him to spy on PALPATINE as does he wants ANAKIN to spy on the JEDI.And to top it all off he is getting visions of PADME'S DEATH at childbirth, so he trys to find a way to save her because like he says ""He can't live without her"" and that is a sign of posession and he had told PADME in episodeII that ""posession is forbidden for a JEDI"". He goes to YODA to find out what he can do to prevent these events from happening and YODA basically says that you can't prevent it you just have to accept it and let go.But ANAKIN does not accept it and will do anything to prevent PADME from dying even if it means believing what PALPATINE says that a SITH is so powerful that they can keep the ones they love from dying. From the first moment when he turns toward the end of the movie. We see him fall deeper and deeper into the darkside as he kills JEDI,PADAWANS,YOUNGLINGS AND SEPARATISTS until he finally force chokes his wife, turns on his mentor and friend OBI-WAN,loses all the rest of his remaining limbs while nearly being burned alive. To later find out that after all that PADME had still died at childbirth. Therefore with ANAKIN not having anything to live for his turn to the DARKSIDE is complete.5)If you look at the prophecy from a certain point of view ANAKINSKYWALKER is the chosen one and not LUKE.Because he destroys the EMPEROR at the end of ""RETURN OF THE JEDI"" and brings himself back to the goodside by saving his son from death. Showing that LOVE truly is stronger then the darkside and LOVE is essential to a JEDI'S way of life.6) Alot of people were wondering why YODA and OBI-WAN became ghosts in the original trilogy and we didn't see much of that in the prequel trilogy?? We'll that got answered in episodeIII whenYODA said "" QUI-GONN had returned from death and was going to teach YODA and OBI-WAN to do the same so that they could become more powerful then anyone could possibly imagine. And I guess ANAKIN was right when he said that "" I WILL BECOME THE MOST POWERFUL JEDI EVER""!!!Because at the end of ""RETURN OF THE JEDI""he showed up next to YODA and OBI-WAN and never had any training?? to get there.Well anyway ""REVENGE OF THE SITH"" is the type of movie that gave alot but left you wanting more. And even though not everything does not seemlessly flow together.

My kids want to see all the Star Wars films and this is the only one I didn't own.In 1977 I was presented with a very believable world.  The ships looked used and carried weight.  The characters were interesting.  The bad guys were really bad.I'm pretty sure that since there are over a thousand reviews no one will every see this, but here goes.Revenge of the Sith is so heavily CGd that it feels like I am watching a cartoon.  The ships have about as much weight as Yogi Bear's picinic basket.  The dialogue is mundane (Must ""I have a bad feeling about this"" be in EVERY SINGLE Star Wars film at least once?)  The droid army is now full of bunglers and wise crackers (even to the point of a droid mouthing off to General Grievous?!!).  Hence my comparison to ""Police Academy"".  The hero's all have quaint one liners written by fifth graders, and the bad guys are all inept incompetents who constantly come to comical ends.  The only thing missing is that guy who does the sound effects (oh wait, we have an Inspector Gadget-like R2D2.  I guess we're covered).The over all feeling of this movie is that it is aimed at an audience of below average intelligence who needs everything explained and will respond only to elementary level dialogue and plot devices.  I haven't feel my intelligence so insulted since I was expected to believe a village of teddy bears wiped out the Galactic Empire's finest.  Oh, and that a little boy in slavery felt that a ""protocol droid"" would be the best assistance to a mother who seems to be a manual laborer and doesn't talk to many people.Some say all this is due to the fact that the film is geared towards today's youth. I say that the youth of today are more intelligent than that and it is merely a case of bad writing.A good movie treats the audience with respect (Iron Man, the Avengers) not condescension."	1.0	Star Wars meets Police Academy	2013-07-08	8	6	2
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2KYH9820YJO9L	W87	I think its pretty much established that Episodes 1-3 are very weak compared to the original trilogy (an lets face it, the acting in those films wouldn't win an oscar). So i think its more appropriate to rate this film alongside its prequels, and to this extent its by far the best. It has the best fights, battles and settings - although many scenes are so ridiculously over the top, to the point where their only purpose is to outdo the previous (the wookie planet is entirely irrelevant).The acting isn't great from anyone really, but did you expect it to be? I'm a huge star wars fan, but again i was very disappointed in George Lucas' directing (in fact many actors and producers have noted that he's better in the editing chair) - the best star wars movies - empire strikes back and return of the jedi were directed by other people, and are all the better for it.And now onto the story - i have to admit the plot comes together quite nicely, although it has very weak moments. Anakin pledges allegiance to the darkside in about 5 minutes, and manages to destroy all the jedi and the republic in 15. I expected something a little more subtle, but there you go. The inevitable wardrobe change into darth vader will is also appallingly cheesy. On the plus side though the film is very dark, and includes a surprisingly violent scene toward the end involving fire - it stands out because its unlike anything in any other star wars movie, and i would be tempted not to show it to young children because of it.So in a nutshell its better than episodes 1 and 2, and possibly equal to 4 - but thats all. At the very least it finishes with a bang (albeit a cheesy sfx bang).	3.0	Better than the other two...	2005-09-01	3	1	2

Like most Star Wars fans of my generation, I was a bit worried after seeing the Phantom Menace.  It was a pretty good flick, but it just didn't measure up to episodes IV - VI in most people's opinions.  Episode II was a notable improvement, as we begin to see Anakin going through the ""typical"" teen angst and rebellion as the soon-to-be-emperor begins to take him under his wing.  Tension increases, and our faith in George Lucas begins to return.  Well, old George came through for us.  As one would expect, this film is dark.  We're watching a hero corrupted after all.  It's also violent and sad.  My 7-year old son was none to happy to hear that he'd have to wait to see the final episode until he was older, but I just didn't think I could justify having him watch dismemberments and people burning alive.

"I was 7 years old when i saw the ""original"" Star Wars (New Hope) at a drive-in. Seeing that on a HUGE screen with a starry background, entrenched the whole Star Wars phenomenon into my psyche. I have been an on and off fan my whole life. I said that to say I did enjoy Episode III quite a bit. At 35, I figured I would never feel an inkling of what I felt on that starry night in 1977 when I saw Episode III. Well, I felt something. It wasn't perfect, but I could tell George Lucas did put an admirable effort into this film. Mr. Lucas still has a ""kid with the best toys on the block"" syndrome with all of the special effects, but at least the story tends to keep up with all the glitz and glash.Ewan Mcgregor and Ian McDiarmad really grow into their roles(Obi-wan Kenobi and Emperor Palpatine,respectively). These two carry the film as far as drama goes. And the one surprise for me is that Hayden Christensen does an admirable turn as the tragic Anakin Skywalker. As one reviewer said earlier you will never see the original Trilogy the same way again. The character of Darth Vader has been a part of Pop culture for a long time. To finally see the history of Vader/Skywalker is entertaining ans saddening to a degree. If you are a true fan, you may be speechless at the end or looking for a refund, but you won't be able to deny that no one will ever come close to George Lucas' Opus again.The first 30 minutes are truly entertaining and fun while in contrast, the last thirty minutes are powerful but disturbing. Parents please show caution when taking your children. The middle is a hodgepodge of great and mediocre acting, over digitized animation, too little characterization and leftover political fertlizer from the first two Episodes. BUT it all comes together nicely in a spectacular fashion.I hope George comes to his senses and decides to do Episodes 7-9, but directed by some new talent. We'll see.

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A1FOGND8008ECX	W. Burton	"I was seven when I saw the original ""Star Wars,"" and like many people of my generation, it had a big effect on my life. The characters, the effects -- all of it, really -- influenced me and a new generation of screenplay and science fiction writers. I'm not nearly the fan of ""Star Wars"" I was in 1977, but I still enjoy watching its laser battles, fantastical landscapes, and character stories from time to time.Unfortunately, I hated ""Revenge of the Sith.""Hated it. Not because I feel any grudge toward George Lucas, or because I tend to overanalyze things, but because I thought the film was so poorly written. In all honesty, I don't think Lucas even hired a script editor to clean up the story or dialogue. This is unfortunate, in my opinion. The writing in this film is so weak and cliched, I couldn't escape the feeling I've read high school screenplays more qualified to be made into movies. Lucas ruined every potential moment of ""Sith"" drama with groanworthy dialogue, poorly crafted character arcs, and simplistic ideas.Viewers have expressed that they enjoyed the ""darker"" plot elements in ""Sith,"" as opposed to the lighter-hearted fare in the first two prequels. That's fine. But in my opinion, Lucas shied away from exploring the real ""darker"" elements of ""Sith,"" instead cheapening its characters with forced dialogue and weak plot arcs, choosing to feed us milk-toast portrayals of what he considers ""dark."" Give me a break.Also, I felt indifferent about the characters by the time the credits rolled. I didn't care whether any particular character lived or died, which is perhaps the most damning evidence of a terrible film.My critique isn't so much that the ideas in ""Sith"" were weak, since I enjoy a Machiavellian ""play both sides against the middle"" takeover of an empire as much as the next guy. My problem lies in the fact that Lucas didn't take the time to refine his script and craft a more compelling movie than the product audiences watched in theaters. I know I'm in the minority here, but I felt utterly unmoved by the film. The hamfisted absurdity of it left me thinking, ""My God, that's it? That's how Anakin became Darth Vader?"" What should've been a moment of haunting defeat, of bitter sadness -- even with a PG-13 rating -- instead became a cringeworthy moment gone horribly wrong. In contrast to the memorable, tear-jerking moments from ""Lord of the Rings,"" the result of quality writing and a true sense of drama on the part of its writers, I felt ""Sith"" imparted only a dull sense of marginal entertainment. And that's sad, really. Even with its emphasis on pleasing the Under 15 demographic, a decision I support, ""Sith"" felt paltry and insultingly simplistic.I'm giving ""Sith"" a 2-star rating due to its impressive digital FX and set designs. If not for these, I would've given it a 1.You could've been remembered as a great director, George.

Even during the fight/action sequences, it's just there, no buildup no tension, nothing(heres a tip too, fighting sequences are no good when you can't tell what's going on, geez I hate how new movies do that). Oh, and I couldn't help but feel like I was watching a comedy at times...wasn't this supposed to be the darkest and most violent of the newer Star Wars(Some of the ideas were dark, but were poorly executed)? I cracked up a few times, especially the ending when Anakin is told by Palpatine that he killed Padme and he cried out ""NOOOOOOOOOOOO"", hilarious. Well, at least this is a tad bit better than the first two but that's not saying all too much. And the acting as other viewers pointed out... sucked, period(even though some are capable actors, just in other movies). If you want to see a great portrayal of a character descending into their own personal hell rent ""Taxi Driver"". It seems George wants to astound you with all the CGI graphics(which I hate personally since it makes me feel like i'm watching a video game) and hope you miss the fact that his actors aren't capable of carrying across any emotion.If you're wondering with all the things I didn't like about the movie, why 3 stars?

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A25PM9JGHPU8EI	Wes	"Well, where do I begin? How about with the first word in the ridiculous opening crawl: ""War!"". Give us a break - trying to evoke thoughts of a WWII newspaper headline does not resonate well with a modern space epic. I thought the cinematography was very well done. One of the unfortunate maladies associated with the prequels is the OVERUSE of CGI technology. It IS effectively rendered in backgrounds and panoramic shots, but it feels terrible everywhere else. I couldn't bear to watch the completely unrealistic acrobatics from all involved, too cartoonish. I welcomed the more serious tone throughout - a relief from the forced, hackneyed attempts at humor in the previous two films. Of all the prequels, I found my eyes rolling back in my head in this one the least. I loved the giant horned-lizard creature Obi-Wan rode around, especially his ""bark"" or ""shriek"" or whatever it was. Natalie Portman was absolutely wasted. The takes of her Lucas allowed into the final cut are shamefully bad - I feel for her (did she shave her head as an act of disgust?). Yoda just does not work as CGI. There were so many instances where his character would have been better served as a ""real"" puppet. R2 and C3PO were wasted - there was no chemistry present between them. 3PO's response at the end of the film when told his memory was to be erased was funny. The politics of the film? YAWN. Grievous wasn't convincing - again, too much a cartoon, not enough menace. Chewbacca and the wookies were wasted - no connection, no feeling for them at all, just thrown in to fill time. Watching Vader be fitted for his costume was an exciting moment, though I didn't agree with the lighting of the scene, which looked like a Vegas showstage. When Vader as we know him came to life, me and my friends burst out in laughter when he broke free of the table he was on. Everyone who's noted the Frankenstein reference is spot on, and it was HILARIOUS. It was even more so when he screamed, ""NOOOOOOOOO!"" - all that was missing was for him to have dropped to his knees, shaking his fists into the air. The childbirth scene was horrible, so sudden as to feel like a throwaway sequence. What has Lucas done? Sure, it's embarrassing to see his legacy come crashing down to the ground, but I don't necessarily agree with the catcalls against him - as if the damage he's done was deliberate, purposefully and KNOWINGLY going away from the warm, engaging, visceral style of the original trilogy. No, I think it's merely a case of a man whose mind of that time, has long since left him. That is, he's INCAPABLE of generating that level of quality - at least not by himself. It was courageous of him to direct all three - but ultimately foolish. The dialogue is weak and the performances by the actors is strained, forced. We can bemoan the tragic fate the franchise has suffered, but that's what happens when so much time is allowed to pass between (spit) ""Episodes"".

""VaiFan"""	"This was a wonderful movie, and the way I see it, no different from the other two, minus better acting. I didn't approach these films from a ""These are gonna be just as good as the originals"", and thats why 90 percent of all the people who saw them were disappointed. I enjoyed all of it because of all the history being presented, and the back stories of these characters we all love.The big complaint people seemed to have, and even the Simpsons lampooned it, was that they thought the story was too complicated ('Then it is agreed: tabled, this motion is. Or is it?'). I followed the plot easily, and ROTS proved to me that the last two movies were totally well played out and completely nesseccary. All was wonderfully climaxed, and it took these two prequels to make this plot beleivable. Without all the quote/unquote ""complicated"" political stuff of the first two, we never would have beleived that Palpatine could have moved into power with such ease. It is better to look at these films as history, rather than kids/family movies, like the original. I enjoyed it, and I think that is why people enjoyed the more mature theme of this one, apart from the innocent buildup of the first two.History will prove me right, as people look back and say, ""OH, maybe those first two weren't as bad as we thought.""

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A15XXOVX6ZNNRO	"William D. Shingleton ""Wishful Thinking Is No..."	"Because I'm living in a remote corner of the world with less than stringent copywright laws, I saw this film first without understanding 90% of the dialogue.  I then got to see it (in English) in the States.  It was way better when I didn't hear the poorly acted and terribly written screenplay.There is no way you can take a film seriously when it has lines like ""Hold me like we were on Naboo.""  Yoda, who through most of the films has maintained a Buddah-like serenity, talks trash while he's fighting the Emperor, not to mention the fact that he basically gives up and runs away at the end of the fight.  And I couldn't stop from laughing when Padme assured an assistant that C3PO would take care of her on her final voyage (actually, there's probably a good comedy in the idea of C3PO taking care of anyone in a dangerous spot).The action sequences are fairly good, particularly the final duel between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan, and the script is not nearly as bad as Episode One (which I still think bordered on an after-school special in the Tatooine scenes).  Natalie Portman and Hayden Christiansen are much better actors in this film than in the previous two, but it's still clear that Lucas doesn't know how to direct young talent.  The film ties up some loose ends such as why Vader doesn't know he has children.On the other hand, I'm a geek, so I have to point out the following:--How does it make any sense to hide Luke with his Aunt on Tatooine using his true last name?--Why would you send someone to a volcano planet for safety?--Why didn't Qui-Gon disappear when he was killed in the first film?--How does Vader realize that Luke is his son in the second film if he doesn't think the children survived?--Why doesn't Obi-Wan recognize R2D2 in Episode IV, or vice versa?I think at the end of the day this film, while better than Episodes One and Two, suffers from the same essential flaw.  Lucas and company spent too much time worrying about special effects and not enough worrying about script, plot, acting, etc.  It's a sad whimper of a way to go out for a series that started off as an icon for an entire generation of sci-fi geeks like myself."	2.0	Much better with the sound off	2005-07-12	12	8	4

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A3HP9JNRHOA5CW	William James Taylor IV	"Well, here we are, the big one, the one that was supposed to blow them all away, the one that was supposed to be the meat and potatoes of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, the big downfall that turned Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) into Darth Vader. The final result is a bit... underwhelming.To be fair, this is probably the least annoying of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, some of the acting is sturdier, the violence is grand as always, there are some very decently dark atmospheric moments, and the lack of the loathsome Jar Jar Binks is appreciated (too bad he had to appear at the end mourning the death of what's-her-name), but it still cannot touch the original Star Wars trilogy. If viewed as a stand alone film, Episode III may not seem all that bad by itself, but when the final turn of Anakin into Vader comes, it's hard to take it seriously or feel affected at all because of the weak story foundation of the previous entries, ""Phantom Menace"" and ""Clones"", and the fact that Lucas failed to build Anakin up to be a sympathetic character. So what if we all knew where he was going to end up? Lucas should have worked a lot harder on Anakin's character ark instead of fiddling around the special effects. Star Wars, once one of the great space operas of cinema, is now and forever truly synonymous with the term ""style over substance"", quantity over quality, flogging a dead horse for the sake of the all mighty dollar, and George Lucas's name really is now permanently connected with ""hack"". Yes, I'm well aware that all Hollywood films are for money, but this prequel block buster trilogy is just poorly and insincerely concocted that it makes the eyes and the ears bleed.Ultimately, all that crap starting in Episode I with Anakin leaving his mother for no bloody good reason, taking ten years to get back to her for no bloody good reason, all the various stretches of logic and credibility (like the Jedi being killed by robots and clones) and the poorly handled friendship between Obi-Wan and Anakin amounts to a mind numbingly banal experience. That's the real heart of the problem: the friendship between Obi-Wan and Anakin never becomes real or believable, despite how hard the actors try, and this all goes back to the fact that Episode I failed to properly portray the beginning of the beginning of their friendship, choosing instead of focus on that pointless waste of time called Qui-Gon Jinn (and this is coming from a person who generally likes Liam Neeson's films).Ewan McGregor and Samuel L. Jackson do their best, and while they're more bearable to watch than some of the other actors - McGregor does a great job of portraying Obi-Wan's horror and anguish when the big duel between him and Anakin is done - they can't save this movie. Ian McDiarmid (the Emperor) is hammy as usual and Natalie Portman is as flat here as she was in the first two prequels, lacking the Earthiness that made Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia so endearing. Hayden Christensen tries hard to squeeze something resembling sympathy from Anakin, and while he's not exactly the greatest actor of all time, the truth is his failure is unsurprising. Odds are that Anakin would have seemed like a hollow jerk regardless of who was playing him, given how bad Lucas's dialogue and direction has become over the years.Let us hope and pray that they fail to make Indiana Jones 4."	1.0	A failure in narrative, just like the rest of the prequel trilogy.	2006-09-24	36	24	12

Look, compared to Episodes I and II (the latter I didn't bother with), this film is f**king GREAT!!  So enough of your tearing down Episode III; at least the circle has been completed.  No, the acting isn't too good, but it wasn't much better in the original trilogy (Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi)--they're ACTION flicks, fer Chrissakes, what do you expect?  Likewise the dialogue...so my advice to the naysayers:  Get a clue, already!That said, I reiterate my comment that Episode III is the best of the newer trilogy.  Episode I was simply wasted potential, although it did us the favour of setting up the story's beginning.  Jar-Jar Binks I could have done without.  Episode II was the one I missed, and haven't regretted that for a moment--as I am to understand it, that was truly the nadir of this trilogy.  But the real meat is here; now, at last, we understand how Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker's friendship was torn asunder.  Samuel L. Jackson, playing Mace Windu (Anakin's other mentor), gets to give the performance he's said he often dreamed of--being in a Star Wars movie--and we see Anakin destroy him without hesitation when the Emperor/Lord Palatine seems on the edge of defeat (that ties together with Anakin/Darth Vader's change of heart in Return of the Jedi when the Emperor is trying to kill Luke and seems about to win; Luke's attempts to convince his father that good still lives in his heart in that film are at last successful).  We see how the Jedi were either destroyed or driven into hiding, how Anakin made his final transformation into Darth Vader (""He's more machine than human by now""), and where the infants Luke and Leia were sent to be raised secretly, out of the eye of their young father's sorrowful wrath...how his beloved's death in childbirth was the final straw that buried good under a mountain of evil in Vader's heart.  (Another note to the naysayers:  Those of you who think Padme's [Natalie Portman] death in childbirth is just a cheap tactic to scare young girls coming to watch this film SERIOUSLY need to get a clue...this kind of thing happens in real life a good deal more than you think, and a nice dose of reality might be just what those young girls need, so please spare me and everyone else your moral grandstanding!  It was never needed here.)The circle is complete.

"This film, like all the other ""Star Wars"" films before it, is packed with action--backed up by the most incredible, jaw-dropping visual effects ever brought to the big screen.  The sound effects bring these visuals to life, and John Williams' musical score--possibly his best ever--brings life to the film.""Revenge of the Sith"", however, is so much more than any of the previous episodes.  It's an EMOTIONAL film; sometimes even disturbingly so.  It's a roller-coaster ride, but not because of the special effects or the action, but because of the emotional punches the film swings at you--especially during the last 45-minutes.From the writing to the acting to the dialogue--and all points in-between--""Revenge of the Sith"" is the best of the ""Star Wars"" movies.  Hayden Christiansen pulled off the Anakin Skywalker character magnificently, making us love the character we will all someday learn to hate.  The actor playing Palpatine was equally strong, and by the end of the film you will absolutely hate his character.  Ewan McGregor, who played Obi-Wan Kenobi, had some of the most touching lines of dialogue in any of the films.  Those of you who have seen the film already know what I mean, but for those of you who haven't, I challenge you not to shed a tear when he says to Padme, ""Anakin is the father isn't he?  I'm so sorry..."" When you see the scene you'll know what I'm talking about.  And later on in the film Obi-Wan has even more emotionally touching dialogue, but I'll let you experience that for yourselves...Fans have loved ""Revenge of the Sith"", but I've been shocked at how many people who have never really liked any of the previous ""Star Wars"" films have come away from this one with such powerfully positive reactions.  The emotional intensity of the film draws you into the world, making that galaxy `far, far away' seem not so distant, since the emotions the characters feel in the film are emotions we all experience in our own lives, so I guess maybe that has something to do with it.  Regardless, ""Revenge of the Sith"" has proven to be a film not just for the fans.In the end, ""Revenge of the Sith"" seems more like a beginning than an ending.

Jamison"""	"The DVD gives us a chance to watch the transformation of a beloved Anakin into the evil Vader at our own pace. Since action demands so much time in the movie, the psychical transformation gets short shrift. The deleted scenes included on the DVD help fill in more of this than what we could view in the theater but still it must be hard for the performers to act in such short scenes to demonstrate such difficult psychological transformations. (Or are we to assume Anakin is not psychologically transformed only taken advantage of?It is hard to see George Lucas' comment that Hayden has always shown the dark side within ""so well"" -- has anyone really been convinced of that? Perhaps that is the point -- so we view Darth Vader now in the new light of his not being the iconic evil but the victim who has lost everything? This is a tough sell and would need more of the kind of movie that would not sell to do well. Jane Austin to the rescue! The movie is certainly stimulating regardless. How very interesting to listen more carefully to the things said: was the Emperor suggesting he was the one who killed his master (who is the ""wise"" who knew how to preserve life?) and is that why Darth does not die? Is this what the emperor meant by prolonging life? Is he suggesting he was the one who -- or his master? -- who gave Anakin life? Remember his mother did not know how she became preganant in the first place. Was the Sith the mysterious source of Anakin's conception? These sorts of questions are the things you can watch for while watching the movie more than once.I certainly appreciate the opportunity to view this more carefully --  a great advantage of the DVD over the theater experience. I also appreciate the commentary, and even the opportunity to listen in French. What a great way to practice a foreign language!"	5.0	Difficult transformation	2005-12-26	3	0	3

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2GUVU889LA2O	"Woo Kim ""Woo S. Kim"""	"For the people who think episodes I-III are pointless, they would be wrong.  I mean I don't comprehend why just because they are using more CGI then they are model kits does it make the series bad.  True, I-III doesn't have the meat and bones that IV-VI have but I just think of it is a book.  How many books have you read where the first three chapters are better then the later chapters.  Episode III really deals with Anakin's problems that began in the first two films.  The ideas of him not wanting to let go of people in his life.  I.e. his mother and Padme.  But also coupling with other things as well.  Distrust between himself and the Jedi, the idea that he feels guilty that he wants to be more powerful, even though he knows it's wrong.  All these things show that evil, comes from human desires.  Things that we all have to overcome.  Anakin's struggles make it far more simpler for Darth Sidious (Ian Mcdarmid) to convert him into Darth Vader.  This film you really Darth Sidious acting chomps as ""the puppet master.""  Ian does such a wonderful jobs at the seduction scenes in the film.  Ewan Mcgergor does such a great homage to Alec Guinness in this film.  My favorite scene with him in the film is at the end of the film with his monologue about ""the chosen one"".  Call me mad, but I like the scenes with Hayden Christen as Darth Vader pre-suit.  My favorite scene with him, is the balcony scene where you see the ""tear"" in his eye.  Which really does show that there is some good in him and that he really does realize what he is doing is wrong.  But I believe it just needed someone that didn't know his past to show him that all this anger and evil is wrong.  That's why I think it is kind of poetic that his son teaches him in episode VI that he made the wrong choice and he needs to fulfill his destiny.  All and all a great film and some wonderful extras.  It's worth every penny."	5.0	Great way to end the film series and it really makes the series flow now.	2007-05-12	7	5	2

STAR WARS is part of american pop-culture. Even if the movie is not ground-breaking, you still have to see the film, it is that important. EPISODE 3 is still mediocre when compared to the the original trilogy: episodes 4-6 but it is still a very relevant part of the series. The movie is a bit darker than the previous 2 episodes, the battle with OBI-WAN and ANAKIN was good, but a bit similar to Obi-wan vs. DARTH MAUL, it was enjoyable, but it still lacked intensity because of the PG-13 rating. All in all, Anakin turned to the dark side because of his lady love.It was an ok movie but you still want to have this in your collection.

Bear with me here.  First, Anakin's turn to the Dark Side seemed very abrupt and without explanation.  Don't get me wrong though, this flick is packed with action and drama, and I enjoyed it immensely.But after watching this movie a few more times, it all has begun to make sense, and Episode 3 has really begun to grow on me.  The only important things to Anakin Skywalker were the desperate love he had for his wife, and the well-being of the Republic.  The fear of losing his wife to death, increasing frustration with a Jedi Council that has denied him the role of Jedi Master, and a council with whom he has gradually become suspicious of due to the whisperings of the shady Chancellor Palpatine.. causes Anakin's mind begins to be clouded with fear, doubt, and confusion.When Anakin discovers the truth about who Palpatine really is, and that he may be the only one who can help Anakin achieve the power needed to save his wife, he is faced with a difficult choice.  Does he bring Palpatine to justice at the hands of a Jedi Council whom he doesn't completely trust anymore and let the power to save his wife die with the Chancellor?  Being young, impressionable, and caught up in the heat of the moment, Anakin makes the wrong choice.  After preventing Mace from killing Palpatine, Anakin is then convinced that the Jedi Council's intent really was to overthrow the chancellor and betray the republic, and Anakin believes his suspicions to be confirmed.All of that said, I still believe that Anakin's turn to the dark side was rushed, and the series could have benefited greatly from another movie that would show more of Anakin's journey to darkness.  The casual Star Wars fan will most likely not find Anakin's turn as credible.  I know, it's alot to digest, but just watch this movie a couple of times and put yourself in Anakin's situation.  You will then begin to understand Anakin's plight, how his mind was manipulated by Palpatine, and how circumstance after circumstance led him further down the dark path.Although the movie has flaws (hence my 4 star rating and not 5), and the acting and script in Revenge of the Sith was not a big improvement from Episode 2, Episode 3 bridges to Episode 4 nicely.  I also am not going to whine about a couple of small details or a small plot hole here and there between the original trilogy and the prequel and give the movie 1 star.  I guess plot holes are bound to happen when you write the 2nd half of the story first, and later write the first half.  The action, drama, special affects, and gripping score are more than enough to compensate for the film's shortcomings, making it a worthy finale to the series.	4.0	Watch it a few times and pay attention...	2005-09-20	9	7	2

As in the 1996 enhancements of the original three here is my wish list for episode three, perhaps you might agree or agree to disagree.1.  With the opening battle building in intensity.  The fleet approaches smaller squads of republic ships led by lesser Jedi's try but fail to stop the vast numbers of droid ships.  Ground batteries  on Courusant start their barrages just before the big capital ships enter low grade orbit and many are brilliantly shown crashing down onto the cities below.  Our two heros with an elite squadron of clone pilots enter now enter the scene.2.  The battle is over and Palpatine brings the hero Aniken to the Senate.  Instead of the scene cutting right after Padme tells Aniken he's going to be a father we instead follow them into the celebration inside the senate where thousands of dignitaries from all parts of the galaxy are cheering.  This instills a desire for fame and recognition in Aniken thus corrupting him further.3.  Windu along with his two best Jedi Knights and their Padowans enter Palpatine's governing headquarters where they have no concrete jurisdiction sort of like the vatican.  They are greeted by both blue and red royal guards.  On the first level they take on the lesser blues with confidence and grace easily eliminating them.  The second level is not so easy as they must face the fewer and far more powerful red guards.  In this acrobatic battle all the Padowans falll to the poison tipped flails.  With these losses fresh in their hearts, Windu and his two remaining side men march into Palpatines office.4.  With the order 66 (?) all the Jedi are eliminated on the Wookie homeworld Yoda fends off the attacking Clones.  Chewbacca and Tarl see this happening and let out a cry and suddenly hundreds of warrior Wookies turn on the troopers.  They throw the clones around like rag dolls.  The first unofficial battle of the rebellion has started.5.  A more engaging Jedi temple battle where Aniken personally takes out the Jedi's that act as the teachers.  The librarian from episode two is thrown out a window or has a book case tossed on her in bitter sweet comic relief.6.  When Yoda and Obi Wan return to the temple they must put on a disguise similar to an Akira Kurosawa  samurai movie in order to get near the entrance.  It almost works but they are discovered when Obi Wan drops his light saber.  Yoda springs to action and the battle is underway.  Once inside we are shown the innards of the huge communication system.  Quickly Obiwan reverses the beacon telling all Jedi to return to the temple.  He then warns with his own voice ""if there are any surviving jedi do not return"".  The camera then takes us to a dozen or more obscure battle scarred worlds where surviving Padowans and Jedis are hiding and some wounded.  The prelude to the television series perhaps.7.  After Yoda lands on Dagobah he pulls out a crystal he took from Palpatine when they fought.  This crystal glimmers with the souls of many evil Sith spirits swirling within.  This is the crystal that gave Palpatine immortal life and one he intended to use on Aniken when the time was right.  Yoda tosses the small spheroid deep into a cave.  The same cave that Luke visits in Empire Strikes Back.Did I go over budget, perhaps yes but if these embellishments were added ala Return of the King style we might have had a more complete ending instead of the feeling we were rushed down the aisle at a graduation ceremony or wedding.  I do understand pacing as episode 4 was far and above my favorite but the last installment needed in my humble opinion a wider scope than what the folks at ILM were able to dish out.  I do say this after reading that in the aftermath of production Skywalker ranch admitted not being able to keep up with the times in being cutting edge and many other studio effects houses have matched and outpaced them in the last ten years."	3.0	Wish list for a 2014 rerelease	2005-11-01	8	3	5

B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A2J3MR64L567OK	Yossarian	"Lucas is on record as stating that both The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones each contain only about 20% of his original ""vision"" for the Prequels (the rest being filler, which clearly comes through in those films), so it only stands to reason that the bulk of the story appears in Revenge of the Sith, the final Prequel and the one that ties back up with the original Star Wars.Right?  Anyone?Actually, Revenge of the Sith is just as meandering and inane as the prior two Prequels, with the only coherence and relevance it contains derived directly from the fact that it has to link back to the original film we all know and love.  The special effects, the only selling point of any of the Prequels, are adequate but nothing to write home about, while the acting, plot, and dialogue plumb the same depths of incompetence we were subjected to in the prior two films.  Astonishing examples of continuity wrecking flaws are gleefully scattered throughout the film, including:-- Leia being taken from her mother as a newborn (despite remembering her in Return of the Jedi);-- Yoda telling Obi-Wan that Qui-Gon taught him how to become ""one with the Force"" (i.e. a Force Ghost) and that Obi-Wan must study this for the 20-odd years he sits around on Tatooine.  Yet nobody bothers to teach Anakin this (who was also Darth Vader at this point) let alone make him study it for 20 years so his appearance as a ghost in ROTJ makes zero sense now (and don't get me started on him also appearing as creepy Hayden Christensen);-- Stuff like ""ray shielding"" that can be used to trap people anywhere on a starship - nobody bothers to use this in the ""future"" of the original films?  Wouldn't the seminal moment in Lord Vader's real introduction, when he storms aboard the blockade runner, have been the PERFECT time for some saavy Rebel technician to trap him in ray shielding?  Duurrr?-- R2D2 serving as Anakin's ship droid, and paling around with Anakin and Obi-Wan the entire time, yet in the original Star Wars, Obi-Wan has no clue who he is (despite R2 even having the same name, and seeking him out!) and doesn't recall ever owning a droid.These are just a few examples of the many instances where Revenge of the Sith reveals itself as yet another lazy Prequel.  Flaws like the foregoing are exactly what one would expect of films made by someone who just doesn't care about the films all that much.  The proof is in the pudding, and the fact that the last 20 minutes of Revenge of the Sith contain pretty much every event of import that people have been expecting since 1999 (or the mid 1980s even) is just ridiculous.  Lucas had *three* films to tell his story, and yet somehow everything we KNEW had to happen is ignored until the very end, which is in turn laughably rushed.  It's just bizarre.In the end, Revenge of the Sith is better than the two other Prequels for most of its length, despite suffering the same set of flaws.  Yet the last half hour or so is so unbelievably rushed and contrived that it descends into self parody.  Revenge of the Sith desperately wants to act like an adult film with adult themes and drama, but comes across as a kid trying on his father's clothes.  It doesn't even take itself seriously, so why should we?"	2.0	Self-indulgent tripe	2005-11-30	16	9	7
B00005JLXH	Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)	A38QPOMSXA872V	Yrutripin	"We spend so much time trying to dissect what we're seeing. For those of us who read the books it is easy to see. I am going to pick apart some of the supposed ""flaws"" everyone is talking about in other postings:- It is hard to depict inner conflict in a person in a movie. If you want a more detailed account than read the book. Personally, I don't think there is a conflict in Anakin's mind. He wants one thing - power. He set out to get it. End of story.- Everyone is debunking the ""continuity"" of the movies because of Leia's flawed memories of her mother. One question: how much do YOU remember as a newborn?? So she was off. BIG DEAL - GET OVER IT.- Here is another ""flaw"" in the moview: Obi-wan was trained by Qui-gon not by Yoda. So you think you found another plot hole, right?? WRONG!!! All young Jedi are called ""younglings"" and they are trained by Master Yoda at a very early age. Obi-Wan was an APPRENTICE under Qui-Gon after his initial training. Anakin was not forwarded the same oppurtunity. He was picked up at age ten and trained by Obi-Wan who later became his master.- Obi Wan doesn't recognize R2 in Episode IV. Let's get a grip folks. When you're an old man are you instantly going to recogize a calculator or VCR you had when you were young?? Obi Wan's attitude toward machines of all kinds is evident in Episodes I and II. He doesn't put much attachment to them and probably wouldn't remember any droid besides R4 (the droid on his ship).Here is the point of all of this typing: quit picking it apart and just watch the movie and enjoy it. Reading some of the reviews was like watching the Anakin whining to Padme scene after killing the Tusken Raiders in Episode II. If you were to stare at every bolt and nut on a roller coaster you would not get as much amusement out of it as someone who simply threw their head back, stretched out their arms and screamed.

Well, ""Revenge of the Sith"" delivers the goods in nearly every way imaginable.Put simply, ""Episode III"" tells two concurrent stories: The turn of Annakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) into Darth Vader by Chancellor/Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), and the fall of the Jedi Republic to the Sith Empire.Without giving away any major spoilers, suffice it to say that the final hour of this movies easily matches (if not eclipses) anything that any other movie throws at viewers.  There are so many ""OMG"" moments left and right that the viewer is left in a relative stupor upon conclusion.I could go on and on, but I'll be brief: after watching all three of the prequels again in order to ""set the second straight"" on their value, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed them.  This is in large part due to the rousing ""finale"" provided in this installment.On a final note, please watch these films on Blu Ray if at all possible.  If any films in history were made for 1080p, the Star Wars efforts are atop the list.Thus, if you enjoyed Episodes I & II whatsoever, Episode III will astound you with its ability to give the Star Wars sage more emotional depth and resonance.

The special effects were amazing, and the story was excellent. I like how as the movie unfolds, Anakin gets angrier and angrier until he turns to the dark side. Great character development. I thought Hayden Christensen gave a great performance, especially in the last hour of the film. He really surprised me this time. We learn alot in this film about the events leading up to Episode IV, and I thought the ending explained alot more about the original trilogy, such as how Darth Vader winds up in his suit, and how Luke and Leia are seperated so they can't be found. Also, I thought the final lightsaber ""showdown"" between Obi-Wan and Anakin was excellent. It kept me on the edge of my seat. As other reviewers may have mentioned, we see Jar Jar, but he doesn't say anything. Awesome. We also see Chewbacca, but he wasn't in the movie very long, which was disappointing. When Darth Vader finally becomes his final form, we see that the Death Star is being built. The fights were amazing. That's all I have to say about them. I will definitely buy this one on DVD.
