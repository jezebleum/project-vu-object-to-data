6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1G0IHVBEN8ZTB	Abdulla M. Al Qasim	If I've seen this movie once, I've seen it a million times! I used to have the set on VHS but never went out and got the set on DVD again for some reason... even though I no longer have a VHS player.First of all, I bought this item because I just love the trilogy and had to have it... couldn't always wait till they showed it on TV! Plus they always show it at some bizarre time during a week day! (Not really worth getting the talking to from the boss because you showed up to work as a sleep deprived mindless zombie over a movie!)Secondly, after reading some of the reviews and their comments on how these movies were restored and how the picture and sound are pin sharp and such, I thought that it would be as if I was seeing it for the very first time... I guess my expectations were very high at first! But To be honest they were right... once you actually ignore the movie and focus on the image... you do notice it.. you don't see any of those fuzzy objects, blotches, and dust that shows on film or VHS tape... it is clear in that sense. In terms of the sound, it is a lot more audible especially when the characters speak in low voices, in the past you had rewind and crank the volume up to hear the dialogue... not the case with this restored version.Thirdly, I always prefer buying movies in complete sets, even though I think that Godfather III was not up to par with the other two! Hey, it doesn't hurt to have it in there, especially at the Amazon price!Fourthly, the price definitely makes it an obvious choice! Three classic movies for an amazing price in one pack!Can't complain really about anything with this item and I am generally very pleased with it and recommend it to any true fan of the trilogy.	5.0	An Offer You Can't Refuse!	2011-06-12	3	3	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A34NDNNY54LE1	A Customer	THE GODFATHER is a phenomenon, commercial and artistic, and is proof that art can influence life. Its a mythic contribution to the search for the perfect American fairy tale, about greed, ambition, family, and guilt. Only in its soap-opera-esque potrayal of the multi-faceted world of organized crime does the film have its strength and weakness. By simplifying this world using iconic characters it makes the mafia approachable, but it also avoids the ugly, inconvenient details.Each film has its own quality. Part I and II compete in most viewers' hearts for favorite status, and Part III is universally regarded as substandard. But, as the documentary shows, all three are flawed, due to artistic compromises. Scenes in the first two films are now iconic, such as Santino's Assassination in Part I and the epipany in Part II. Each film is story-driven, but, like the &quot;Abortion&quot; scene in Part II demonstrates, it is also a story with characters, something disappearing from film in general.However substandard Part III may be, it is necessary, because the movie, as a whole, is not about gangsters, but Michael. Numerous other films, inspired by THE GODFATHER and starring Al Pacino, have portrayed organized crime more realistically, but THE GODFATHER is the simple tale of one man trying to be an American.The deleted scenes provided in the fifth disc are gems that flesh out characters even more. The documentary also inserts the movie in the corporate politics of the movie industry that is a part of the American fairy tale. This is the second time (later, in APOCALYPSE NOW) Coppola's wife has examined a film by her husband, and almost outdoes him for clarity and succinctness.What makes the film so engaging is also so disturbing. That viewers indentify with characters only proves the power of the American fairy tale on Americans. THE GODFATHER is a mirror on our souls.	5.0	An American Fairy Tale	2002-01-11	1	1	0
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AJAF1T6Q7XM94	A Customer	I think my award for the best acting performance of all time would go to Marlon Brando as Don Corleone.  Al Pacino puts in an excellent performance in the great role of the don's youngest son.  I've heard people say that  Godfather 2 is better than the original, but I'll take the original any  time.  Godfather 2 doesn't give us as great a character as Brando's  Corleone, and the role for Pacino isn't as appealing or exciting.  It's a  decadent Pacino in Godfather 2.  The big finish in Godfather 1 is a  classic.  This is one of the few movies, though not the only one, where  gangsters are likeable.	5.0	The best action movie	2000-02-08	5	1	4
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3UGPHXVDUV8A5	Adam Black	I've wanted the Godfather DVD ever since I bought my player.  One and Two are among my favorite movies of all time.  But Coppola made a lousy movie with Three and now he wants us to pay for it.  I mean its a shame his kid can't act worth a dime (have you seen her in anything before or since?) but why pick our pockets for it.  So that leaves us paying at least 75 bucks for 2 (albeit great) movies.  Please, we've all waited this long, wait a little longer and they'll have no choice but to split them up and we can all buy the movies we want rather than having an aweful movie cramed into our collections.	1.0	Don't buy it, maybe we can get a fair price	2001-06-18	55	24	31
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A33L7G4E8CID3	"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19"""	For me, the greatest film ever made is The Godfather, Part II. This is a sequel that accomplishes everything that the first movie accomplished twice over, thanks to the intersecting storylines which show the parallels between the rise to power of young Don Vito and Michael's attempts to invest in Cuba and eliminate his enemies. Although Michael wins all his battles in the film he loses most of his family, and the surprise party scene and subsequent final view of Michael sitting on a bench show a defeated man who is nothing but a wasteland of sadness. To call him a shell of a man would be overstatement. Where The Godfather (and the Vito storyline in Part II) were ultimately comic in that the situation worked out for the protagonist in the end, the Michael storyline is perhaps the most profoundly tragic ever on film. It is the stuff of Greek tragedy, Oedipus Rex, or Medea. Even though Michael deserves his fate because he has done some wretched things, it is impossible not to feel sympathy for him. This is human tragedy at its most poignant and powerful, and that it works so famously is no small testament to Al Pacino and Dianne Keaton as Mike and Kay Corleone, as well as John Cazale as Fredo, Lee Strasberg as Roth, Robert De Niro as young Vito, and Michael V. Gauzzo as the unforgettable Frank Pantangelli. All are wonderful here, and the storytelling is at its peak.Its predecessor, however, is generally revered as the greatest movie ever made. I put it at number two. The Godfather is the ultimate gangster film, but it is ultimately a film about the human experience. Destiny, family, passion, betrayal and redemption are only part of what's explored here. Also magnificent are the standout performances. Brando as Don Vito, Pacino as Michael, Caan as Sonny, and Duvall as Tom Hagen are all fantastic, and all were nominated for Oscars. Coppola brings all the elements together in such a powerful way that The Godfather is a film that commands praise and attention. Its combination of sensitivity and raw power are mesmerizing. Perhaps the greatest problem with the film is, ironically, its own success. It is an iconoclastic film, and so many of its words and scenes are so deeply engrained into the cultural lexicon that it is not possible to fully enjoy the film the way it was meant to be enjoyed. That said, even overexposure doesn't rob much of it from being a hauntingly poignant yet satisfying movie. The horse's head scene is still very potent. Ultimately, this is a movie which would be the best movie ever had the sequel not been made.Although the third installment has been much maligned, it is not a bad film. It is just not as good as the first two, and it really can't be helped. This movie's central theme is redemption, and Al Pacino gives perhaps his most touching performance as Michael Corleone, who really hates what he's become and tries to make amends through charity and faith, but can't fully escape his past. While flawed, it's certainly worth watching, especially for the other wonderful performances from Joe Mantegna, Dianne Keaton and Andy Garcia.Now this DVD set is impressive. The films look great and sound even better. There are plenty of extras about the making of the films. But the best part of it for me was the deleted scenes. Sure, many movies promise deleted scenes, and there are usually a few that were probably scrubbed for technical malfunction or are competely worthless to the story. This set, though, contains dozens of scenes, many of which are absolutely wonderful and added to the story. For once, I actually would have liked to have seen an edition of the film with the deleted scenes inserted. There is only one from Part III, though, and it's just an extension of another scene in the film. I guess they didn't cut much from the movie.If you haven't seen these treasures of American culture, make them the next movies you see. I guarantee it, you won't regret it.	5.0	The two greatest films ever made and a decent one	2003-11-01	5	5	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	ADLVFFE4VBT8	"A. Dent ""Aragorn"""	Let's put this behind us: the Godfather was, is and will always be 'grainy'. It's just the way they were shooting movies THIRTY-SIX YEARS AGO. So, yes, it's a 36 year old movie and it looks its age. It's true, '2001' looks a lot better on blu but, apparently, that's the best that could be extracted from the existing Godfather negatives - there is an entire 'extra' that explains how the transfer was done and the sometimes painful choices the restorers had to make. The transfer is grainy all over. It's grainy all the time. The whites are grainy and so are the blacks. In the end, it does not really matter or it didn't matter much to me because it's better than anything I've seen yet.Moving beyond grainyness, the picture is steady like rock. I wasn't able to detect any major artifacts. The extra available on 'disk 4', showing the kind of work and the technology invested into this product convinced me that this is the best-looking Godfather except maybe the first screening at the Chinese theater in Hollywood that we are going to see in a long, long time. [A post blu-ray 'better' edition is possible in 10 years or so, when blu-ray is surpassed by a new technology, because the best negatives found were digitized on a resolution that's about 3 times higher than the current blu-ray.]No major complaints about the sound. It's TrueHD 5.1, it's clear but don't expect any surround effects. I doubt the original was even stereo. It was a little bit low-volume on my stereo but it's probably my equipment to be blamed.The extras on the 4th disk are actually worth watching. They are shot in HD. There's one where just about all major elderly and late-middle-age Hollywood directors and stars show up and say something, there's one about the restoration itself, a little short where some younger artists appear and say funny things. Overall... not too bad. Oh, besides the HD's, you also get the extras from the 2001 DVD edition and THAT's where you see the difference between Blu and the (previous) DVD version.Now, for the bloopers section, get this: the blu-ray comes with the plastic disk case inside a cardboard boxy sleeve (very nice) but... there's also a nice 12-page brochure with the pictures of Coppola, Pacino, Brando and information on the contents of each of the 4 disks - coffee table style. Well... the brochure was meant to fit inside that cardboard sleeve, next to the plastic blu-ray disk case but it comes actually GLUED to the cardboard case because... it's too big. Someone forgot that the blu-ray cases are a bit smaller than the DVD's and, apparently, the brochure was supposed to be a 'one size fits all' kind of deal that doesn't fit the blu-ray. Sad.Overall, I enjoyed the Blu Godfathers. While, yes, the picture is grainy and the transfer does not look like the Transformers or Ratatouille, not even like '2001', the blu-ray does look a lot better than the DVD version. This rendition of the Godfathers has many defects, it's far from perfect but, as far as I know, it's the best there is. I do not regret making the purchase.I took away one star for the little brochure snafu and for the relatively high price (likely to go down) at release time.	4.0	Best version I've seen so far - yes, the picture IS grainy and there's a packaging blooper too	2008-09-27	138	127	11

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2Z5RFU4DH3T0G	"A. Fondacaro ""NiaTonyF"""	While the original film ranked #2 on the AFI's list of 100 Greatest Movies (#1 being Citizen Kane), many film buffs, afficionados, and audiences believed that the first Godfather film deserves that #1 spot.  How many people do you know who know some of those famous quotes like, &quot;I'm gonna' make him an offer he can't refuse,&quot; or &quot;Never take sides against the family again, ever...&quot;  A few maybe?  Or perhaps you grew up in an Italian family like mine and your father can translate the Italian for you while you watch?  Now how many people can quote Citizen Kane beyond, &quot;Rooooosebuuuud....&quot;Despite the excellence of the first film, it is my opinion that Godfather part 2 delves deeper into the family, more into the two-toned life that Michael Corleone orchestrates between the family business and his family.  Nowhere is this more apparent than with the relationship he cultivates between himself and Hyman Roth (wonderful performance by Lee Strasberg), cementing the old adage that you keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  On the surface they are friends, behind closed doors they are co-conspirators, between each other they are close friends and confidants.  Beneath it all, in the depths of each man's heart, they are mortal enemies, Corleone ultimately the victor.  The whole movie is a mounting tension between the two, reaching heights as when Hyman fumes over the death of a great man, Mo Green, whom Corleone had killed in the first film.  In the end, Hyman becomes just another victim, mowed down by a Corleone footman.The court proceedings are shot in a way that transmits the claustrophobia and morose tedium of the justice system back in the days of McCarthyism (the eras align somewhat, both post-war 1950's).  The court is crowded, people line the walls, journalists write furiously in the heat of the courtroom, in the background, people walk in and out of the proceedings like is was a Wal-Mart.  People speak into microphones, their voices drone in the hollow, sparse room.And then Michael Corleone has his own brother killed.  Many would say this is when Michael gives himself over fully to the title &quot;Godfather.&quot;  This is actually one of the central themes of the first film, when exactly does Michael become Godfather?  The first film has a wonderful moment where, in the family office (the predominant colors are brown and orange), Brando gets out of his chair, moves over to the side of the office, Michael gets up from the couch on the other side, moves to the desk, and sits in his fathers chair.  This is when Michael becomes Godfather in my opinion, but Coppola is good enough to give us more moments that question exactly, &quot;When?&quot;Coppola's film legacy lies within this box set, as does Pacino's, Brando's, Caan's, and Duvall's.  DeNiro managed to go off and do other things, his legacy lies somewhere else, but to the aforementioned actors, they have never done another film or role as well as what they did in the Godfather films.  You don't realize it until you pop in the bonus disc, but composer's Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola also put their legacy into this film with the music.  Who can forget Rota's seven-note theme that opens and closes the film?  Carmine Coppola adds a more Italiano flavor to the music in the flashback scenes featuring DeNiro as a young Vito Andolini (a.k.a. Don Corleone in the first film).There's so much to go over, the least of which is film #3.  But the contents of the other three discs justifies the cost, which could actually be higher.  But really, this collection is an offer you can't refuse, or do I have to put a gun to your head??	5.0	Coppola's legacy enclosed with others	2004-07-18	3	2	1
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1AAN285FE45GP	A. Fultz	It has become fashionable to call The Godfather the greatest movie of all time.  Although I am usually questionable of all things fashionable, this is one case of the crowd actually getting it right.  This movie is a  masterpiece. Remaining true to Mario Puzo's novel, The Godfather is  entertaining from the first scene to the last. Despite its long running  time, this movie is never boring, and at the end you will be left begging  for more (thankfully Mr. Coppola was kind enough to provide Part II later).  The performances of Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duval, etc. are fantastic.  Without a doubt, The Godfather is the greatest of all time.

Coppola's  film is about the same, only here he is a surveilance guy, but in both  films (as in De-Palma's &quot;Blow Out&quot;, a stated take off on  &quot;Blow Up&quot;) the philosophical question rises: &quot;Can we count  on our senses to help us grasp what's real and what's not?&quot;.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A185TN82SHGBQJ	Alan	Movies: GF1 is a very solid movie, exceptional in every way. It stays very close to the book. The final moments of the film are breathtaking. 10/10. I liked GF2 better than a first film. I found the story to be more interesting. The whole corruption plot in both family ties and in business world really engaged me in the story. The final moments of the film hold the same power as it's precedor's climax but the flashback endings wasn't very well edited in my opinion. 10/10. GF3 has a very big potential. Unfortunately I did not agree with F.Coppola's decision regarding the whole concept of the film. He was focusing too much on a family values, which did not really satisfy me or most of the other viewers. IMO PartIII should've been a strong finish based more on business. However, the ending of the film is very very very powerful and dramatic, the best in the Trilogy. 9/10Video Quality: Overall transfer is nice. Grain is still in effect, but the picture definitely looks sharp (In most cases) and HD quality is visible. Unfortunately not all scenes been fully transfered, take for example the scene from GF3 when Mary takes a pictures at train station - poor quality. 8/10Audio: I appreciate the uniqeness of the transfer, but not completely satisfied with it. Most of the time I found myself with remote control adjusting the sound volume. In some cases it's too loud, in some cases it's too soft. 7.5/10Overall I'm very satisfied with this product.

I'm not as happy to say that I'm a LaserDisk owner.  Otherwise, The greatest achievement LaserDisk has is that the Godfather Triology is put together in sequential order.  Where the flashbacks are all in chronological order in the triology.  You are watching 1 movie instead of 3.  It's AWESOME!Therefore, Will this &quot;The Godfather DVD Collection&quot; have this same feature?Thanks, adonato3@acorn-group.net	4.0	Does this Godfather Collection compare to the LaserDisk ver?	2001-06-12	12	3	9

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2TLEB18074L4S	Alexander Leach	Francis Coppola's trilogy finally makes its appearance on DVD, an it was worth the wait.  Of course III is fatally weakened by the bizarre casting of Sofia Coppola, but the first two films more than compensate, indeed this is one series where the sequel even tops the original Godfather film.All the performances are excellent: Brando is humane and commanding (although the padded cheeks add nothing to his character), Pacino makes his traversal from gangster ingenue to mob boss more than convincing, and de Niro is superb as the young Vito Corleone.  Also do not forget the excellent Robert Duvall and James Caan in the first film.The DVD transfers are first rate.  In Godfather I there is very occasionally a hint of sky grain in some scenes, but for the most part the image is rock solid, with no grain or edge enhancement, showing off the peerless photography of Gordon Willis.Beam up chapter 12 in The Godfather where Michael returns to Sicily to check out how good this transfer is.  Colours are natural and vivid, and there are only a handful of tiny flecks or nicks throughout the films, so the prints are in nigh on pristine condition.The sound is also superb: the organ pedal notes during the famous christening sequence are stunning in their depth.This set is worth every penny of its asking price, and has not dated, although it also shows how fine a TV series The Sopranos is, matching these films in terms of script, performances and direction.	4.0	Epic filmmaking, excellent DVDs	2001-10-09	5	5	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AH4SL0YL5AQVU	Alric the Red	The first SD DVD box set of THE GODFATHER looked terrific on my SDTV, but its upconversion for the HDTV was the worst of any DVD I owned.  I was thrilled to hear of this new edition.  A couple of weeks ago, I was dejected by the Blu-ray release of a favored classic, and as a result, the knee-jerk desire to collect the latest improved edition is no longer part of my consumer profile.  I'll LOOK first.  Which I did with this: I rented it.  And I'm happy to report that it is as advertised, a restoration that's as good as possible, completely remastered, sound and all.  The grain level is more natural and the mottled highlights present in the first SD set are gone.  A couple of scenes are slightly blurrier than the rest, and there was one very, very brief scene that evidently could not be saved and looked as terrible as it did on the last SD set.  It was jarringly bad, but brief.  But the obvious effort that went into this suggests that the restoration team simply could not locate a salvageable print of that segment.  The rest of it is so good, I can accept this one ten-second flaw, and I'll definitely add this one to the collection.  Plainly put, this is it, as good as it'll ever be.  No matter how many times I see this, I'm still amazed at the level of acting, the rich characterizations brought to life with a thousand little touches.  These are people recognizable from your own life (sans the criminal activity).  It's no wonder that it won so many awards.  And it's no wonder that it ranks among so many top-10 lists.  No doubt, it will for years and years to come.	5.0	Vastly Improved!	2008-10-28	6	5	1

The picture quality, sound and extras are just outstanding. But The Godfather is much more than its production values. Few movies have a screenplay that is powerful enough to explore character, motivation, the subtleties of personal (as well as public vengeance) played against an internal drama of yearning for self-renewal and restoration as this epic saga succeeds in doing. It's a movie to watch again and again, each time viewing it differently than the last. Simply outstanding.	5.0	Outstanding movie and restoration	2012-03-24	0	0	0

I wished that Part II had been released as well.  Dolby Digital made all the difference.  Some complain that it's too grainy, but I think that's part of its charm.  Some complain that it's not widescreen.  Actually, it is widescreen, it's just not letter-boxed.  As one of a growing minority that actually has a 16x9 tv, I couldn't be happier not to have half my screen wasted by those stupid black bars.  However, I can understand how that might suck or the masses.  My one complaint, which is the same as many, is that the Godfather Triology 1901-1980 was not released at the same time.  Now I've got to buy both.  But who can really complain, it's an offer I can't refuse.	5.0	Great, but it's not the triolgy	2001-10-25	0	0	0
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AL1E1OV6XPK1G	Amazon Customer	It looks and sounds great to me!  The extra features are cool, and I for one don't want all the additional scenes (the ones for the Godfather Saga on TV) inserted.  I prefer them where they are.  Some of those scenes are good (the Genco scene), but others are just unnecessary (all the errands run before Paulie is shot).  I thought the Family Tree was a great addition to the extras disc, too.  The movies ARE dark (particularly I and II), but that was the intent (check out Gordon Willis' comments on the extras disc).  And finally, I don't know why everyone is so harsh on III.  For me, the only real flaw in it is Sofia Coppola's performance, but I can look past that and still enjoy it.  I think one reason people don't like it as much is that it takes place in more modern times and doesn't have that lush, romantic feel about a lot of it--as the earlier movies do in buckets.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AX6YZZ47ZWUPW	Amazon Customer	The  Godfather saga is a true slice of the history of America.  The acting is superb, the films are quite violent, and rightly so.  The Corleone family could certainly not ber viewed as boy scouts.  Deceit and murder were their stock in trade, as it was with the other Mafia families.  The struggles for power, the greed, and corruption, are all factors in the lives of these criminal organizations.  One can watch these films over and over again.  And still find new insights into the crimial life style.  I purchased these films for their excellent portayals of organized crime.  But I also bought them because thet highlight the negative effects of this life style on its participants.  These dvds are well worth buying, a very entertaining trilogy.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3VQIJCGKISRKK	"Amazon Customer ""kenny Bieber comicfreak"""	"I just recently after so many years got down to watching these movies and to tell you the truth i enjoyed them all very throughly. I don't own part 2 or 3 yet but i will once amazon ships me the blu-ray restoration set. Anyways here l would like to evaluate all 3 films and disscuss my true feelings as to why i enhoy this beautiful fautless and stunning trilogy.First i'll explain the 1st godfather as follows. In this criticaly aclaimed masterpiece  Francis ford coppola really focuses on central themes of human life such as family moral decline struggle to survive nad the changing of times. The film starts off with an elaborate wedding ceremony for the don's only daughter connie . At this wedding we quickly get a well detailed look at how this family operates . We also met several of our primary characters the reluctant son michael played brilliantly by Al pacino in all 3 films Sonny the hot tempered son played by James cann and Kay michael's girlfriend who he promised to he would never become his ""Family"".  The film later shows a attmpt to kill the don after he refuses an offer to join the narcotics bussiness and this leads michael to step in and avenge his father which later starts his transformation into the new don.  The way coppola weaves between the multiple story arcs here is great every scene , line, performance and sub-plot added to the film minor or major. The cinematography is gorgeous and the vilonce has a smart, simple yet brutally effective ring to it. The middle holds up quite well and the pacing is held together very well something the other two are good at as well. The acting is phenomal and the feeling here is really humantisic  and real and it shows throghout . the dialouge is brilliant with lines you won't forget.  The characters are very well-written and the ending is very memorable and intense.  overall the elements , subject matter ,writing and feel of the film are very well done and beautifully written and make this film a must-see smart, humanistic , real gritty , engaging and original grade A+next i'll explain gf 2 like this. in the very dark intense and intricate companion piece of the original GF 2 tells two very disticnt powerful expansive ambitous riveting and complex stories. One is of Michael Corleone 's fatal rise to power nad how he single-handedly destroys his life of prosper with his cold ruthless manner and  young vito rising up to the top . The Flahbacks here are great Robert de Niro is perfect as the young vito and really gets into character and the flashbacks were well-written and did an outstanding job flushing out vito's history escepially the later ones . Michael's story is very good too although it does lack some of part 1's power it still is a very complex layered superb mafia tale with deep layers of phsycology and is intense and original and not some of the recycled mumbo-jumbo some sequels end up as ( ie pirates of the caribbean 3)  . Michael 's plotline involves him dealing with a betrayl within the family while trying to do bussuness with a jewish gangster Hyman Roth . This storie takes michal from Havanna to New york to Miami . The best scenes are in Havanna and during the communion celebration opening which like part 1 did a brilliant job of establishing thing early on and did a great job of showing how different things have gotten for the family since Michael's new reign. Another noteworthy scene is when Michael confronts the traitor in the family or when Michael goes to Hyman Roth and asks who tried to have his associate Frank pentangli killed who is played brillianttly by Michael V. Gozzo.  Diane keaton is great as kay and shares some really great moments with michael and the scene with them disscussing her leaving is amazing.  The vilonce like in paer 1 is brutal , effective and chilling and works well into the plot. The themes in here of Moral disintergration , corruption , greed , treachery , loss and isoaltion are excellently handled never do we question ford coppola's reason for doing this or that  it all fits and the film fits naturally nothing seems akward or mishapen or cookie-cutter or stale it always keeps itself moving. The cast in ths picture is brilliant From another amazing performance by Al pacino Great work by Diane keaton John cazale , Robby Duvall , lee strassburg Mike v gozzo and of course Robby de niro and even Tallia shire does sone good work too.  The other actors are good too but the ones i metioned above i think are the best performers in the whole film. This is easily one of the best sequels of all time , smart m gripping , complex , original, brutal, intense, Dark and emotional and extermely vibrant and colorful the realism and humanity are great as well and the film paints a very good picure of a man's  dark plunge toward decay and another's toward prosper and wealth. overall a great follow-up companion piece to it's predecessor and very much a must-see and brillantly acted . Grade A+next i'll explain Gf 3 like this.  In the final installment of one of cinema;s finest most interesting trilogies  the film flashes foward many years  to show Michael corleone  as an aging old man trying to burie his past sins and leave the dirty world of crime and murder he immersed himself in part 1 and 2.  The storie thickens when Michael meets Vincet Mancini Sonny's llegetimate son from part 1 .  Vincet is determined to put rival gnagster joey zasa out of his misery.  After a heated confrontation with joey Michael decides to keep vincet under his wing .  The plot for part 3 is very emotional  and well-balanced nad very intelligent and engaging  and does a great job of using the backstory of the first two parts to tell the story . The acting while maybe dosen't outbeat that of part 1 and 2 is pretty good. Andy Garcia is great as Vincet mancini and Al pacino once again proves why he is MICHAEL CORLEONE this is the only guy who could really play michael the right way parts 1 2 and 3 wouldn't have been as good as they are todaywithout him. Diane keaton is strong and steady in her role and Eli wallach is good as Don altobello michael's latest adversary and Talia shire is wonderful in giving connie more edge nad pressence thiss time around.  The cinematography is brilliant-looking  and the music is great like in pars 1 and 2 and the vionce still is very effective and important to the film. The dialouge and writing are great overall and the ending is a powerhouse of emotion and very wellfilmed although the final shot could have been done better.  For the most part part 2 is a memorable , engagin. smart and very emotional and humanistic and operatic and very fluent and graceful and the way it unfurls very intelligently and for the most parti s very well-done i mean not everything in part 3  beats out part 1 and 2 but still it is effective and entertaining and sofia coppola is not as bad as everyone says although she's no brando or pacino. GRADE A+In conclusion this is a very memorable well-written trilogy and is a brilliant addition to cinema as a whole definitely worth looking at it can't wait to take a look at it again."	5.0	one of the most powerful sagas in cinema	2010-05-13	0	0	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2C5D9IGOXNVB9	Andrew Sterland	We all know how great this trilogy blu ray is - all those reviews can't be wrong.I'm just fairly upset as I received this in the mail yesterday and to say the box was beat up would be an understatement.  I know it wasn't the carrier's fault as I purchased about 7 or 8 other blu rays in the same amazon order & box - all were in perfect condition.The back of the box is unfortunately where the glossy godfather linear notes booklet is contained - one of the corners was completed folded in half beyond repair.  Both top and bottom of the glossy notes, as well as the box itself were beat up 'almost' to the point of being ripped.  They can't be creased back into shape.  The plastic case insert holding the godfather 3 blu had been torn off the hinge.  Luckily the discs themselves appear fine.I got this at the current discounted price of $19.99 but, it's the principle of the purchase..  A brand new product should not be in this condition.  If I bought this used from an ebay seller I'd almost give negative feedback based in the condition of this box, let alone a brand new sealed set of blu rays direct from amazon.com.I know I could probably seek replacement through amazon but, without being intimate with the process, I'm guessing I'd have to send it back, and wait for a new one.  I'm in Australia so the process would probably take a month in shipping time back and forth - for a $20 purchase, I just can't be bothered.  However, for note amazon : pick up the Quality Control of your products before shipping please.  New.. = new condition.  A real let down and disappointment on what is otherwise one of the best blu ray releases ever - one that I should have been able to cherish with pride of place on the shelf, with the rest of my 1000 strong collection of blu rays!  Not some beat up second-hand-looking cardboard box..	3.0	Arrived in poor condition	2012-11-19	6	3	3

The colors are bright and vibrant and the grain is just right not too grainy. Most of the features are carried over from the dvd's but i didn't have the dvd of part 3 so I enjoyed hearing the commentary track for that film. Overall you can tell a lot of love and care was put into this restoration and set and the packaging is great comes with the slipcover and plastic case.

Naturally this means that the film grain is retained, but if that bothers you, then you really shouldn't be watching these movies in the first place.  The colors are amazingly rich, and the detail is not lost in the transfer from film to Blu-Ray.This set comes with a disc containing a ridiculous amount of supplementary materiel, including all the supplementary material from the Godfather DVDs.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AJU90WQI1ZK52	anthony jasso	The Godfather 1 and 2 are my all-time favorite movies. I have seen them so many times I have dialog much of the dialog memorized. When the Godfather was re-released on the big screen a few years ago I was amazed at how fresh this movie still seemed after seeing it on video a number of times. So when the DVD was released, I questioned whether I should buy it or not, and argued that at the very least they are my favorite movies so I bought them. At the time of this review I have only seen the first disc and I am absolutely thrilled and more than satisfied. A few reasons come to mind. One is that I am seeing a lot of things I had never noticed before. For instance I was completely shocked that I had never noticed in the distance, the statue of liberty during the hit on Pauly. I also am hearing a lot of things I had never heard before on VHS format(too many to things to mention). And finally the audio commentary by Coppolla is very insightful and interesting(the studio was actually going to fire him 3 weeks into filming because they didn't like the film - and yes, that was a REAL horses head). Anyway, I am having too much fun watching these so far, and I am only on the first one! This is a perfect example of why they made the DVD format!	5.0	DVD Format  is a Real Treat!	2001-10-10	0	0	0

He told me that it would ship out right away and that I would get the shipping info to return the empty case at my leisure.  And that was that, they were easy to deal with on the phone, the whole call process took less than ten minutes and the best part is it was shipped next day priority!I called with a problem at 1pm on a Friday and had my replacement at my door at 11am Saturday!! 22 hours from call to replacement - Customer Service like that just simply cannot be beat!	5.0	These films are great, Blu-ray is great, and Amazon customer service is great.	2013-07-15	2	2	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	ALR35EFI69S5R	"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman"""	"I suppose one could successfully summarize the moral underlying the Godfather saga as being the idea that the wages of sin are death and destruction, but of course the magnificent legend of the Corleone family is much more than that, and is hardly reducible to such a simple interpretation.  Director Francis Ford Coppola is no stranger to the dangers of excess, as a careful screening of his wonderful epic, ""Apocalypse Now"" masterfully illustrates. And while Coppola often strays into excess with this three episode story covering a fifty year period, his creative genius in showing how the child becomes father to the man is fleshed out and demonstrated with realistic, flesh and blood characters who remind us all of others we have know.  And it is in this fashion that he threads the moral message of how family and personal history intertwine to trap one into a destiny that both reinterprets and yet again recapitulates the cultural milieu from which it springs.There is also the collective genius of the ensemble cast, an eclectic collection of the rising luminaries of their time, such as the matchless Marlon Brando, having arisen like the Phoenix from the ashes of relative obscurity to reclaim his lost luster and reputation. Of course, Robert DeNiro, playing the young and emerging Godfather, is simply superb, as usual. Given the fact that he is actually Irish, unlike most of the other actors, who have Italian-American heritage, it is even more stunning to watch how masterfully he interprets his role.  There is Al Pacino, a rising star who proved with this part he had the ""legs"" to go to a stunning career as a dramatic force all of his own. Also terrific is Andy Garcia, a hotheaded Corleone cousin, illegitimate offspring of Sonny.Then we must add Robert Duvall, who beautifully underplayed his supporting role in two of the segments as the legal advisor to the Godfather, delivering the ominous legend regarding ""an offer you cannot refuse"" more than once for his adopted family. There is, too, Coppola's sister, Talia Shire, who went on to further fame as Sly Stallone's ever-faithful main squeeze in the seemingly endless Rocky series, and Diane Keaton, who like Pacino and Shire, is one of the several actors to actually appear in all three films. There is John Cazale, who is a veteran character actor who plays Fredo, the weaker older brother whose character flaws prove to be fatal. The list of wonderful actors involved in this massive nearly twenty-year project just goes on and on.At its base, of course, the author of the best-selling book providing the basis for the original film, Mario Puzo, styled his story around the framework of a Shakespearean tragedy, the way in which young Michael Corleone become ensnared by family and personal circumstances into becoming the Godfather himself.  Coppola uses the story to examine the darker and more tragic of human qualities that lead us so far astray, and the sage becomes a cautionary allegory for the dangers implicit in reaching for power in a corrupt and all too malleable world.

Most of the movie is extremely grainy - you will notice very little difference over regular DVD. To be fair, though, strangely, some scenes are definitely HD.Also, unless you have upgraded your sound system to TrueHD, you can forget about having digital sound in English. This disc does not play DTS or Digital 5.1 in English.  However, DTS is available in French or Spanish - if you happen to prefer the international theater experience.  It's not clear what the folks at Paramount were thinking here. VERY Disappointing!Don't be fooled by comments indicating ""that's the way old films are supposed to look"" - 35mm film is capable of capturing far more detail than your HD/1080p TV can reproduce, so depending on the condition of the ""master"" film stock, there's no reason this film should not look great in HD.  Need proof? Check out ""Grand Prix"" starring James Garner (i have in HD-DVD), filmed in 1964, and released '66.  Picture will leave you breathless - looks like it was filmed in HD - a perfect showcase for your HD theater.There are plenty of grainy, nostalgic-looking versions of Godfather out there, including the old VHS versions.  The blu-ray version is not worth the $60-80 upgrade."	2.0	SAVE YOUR MONEY	2008-09-27	22	8	14
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1ZP3F3PSDURB4	"Beatle23 ""beatle23"""	Everyone pretty much knows these movies before they're buying them so I don't have to get too critical about the stories.  We all know they are up there in the history of film.  Did the DVD's rank up there as well though?  YES.First of all, I owned the VHS copies of these movies.  The DVD's as you can imagine provide excellent visual clarity and sharp colors in the picture.  That in itself is a reason to buy these DVD's even if you own them in VHS.  The picture quality IS that much better.  For those who have a sound system, the 5.1 audio tracks are very welcome.  The sound distribution was decent, but at times scant in terms of surround sound.  That's not a fault of the sound mix, but more of the movie's quiet, dark tone.  There aren't whirling bullets or massive explosions left and right to employ every channel, every scene to its maximum.  Nonetheless when it has to, all 5 channels are used efficiently.The main disc people will be hungering for will be Disc 5.  The whole thing is just bonus features.  The documentaries, featurettes, historical/rehearsal footage, etc... are all abundant and appropriate.  This is unlike other DVD's that cram itself with useless features that provide no insight into the film's making or history.  Every feature in here provides something new and interesting for the Godfather buff.  Now, some may be redundant such as the deleted scenes that were edited into the movie when they aired the Godfather Saga chronologically.  Nonetheless, it's a gem to have them all here isolated.  Lastly, the commentaries by Coppola are superb as anyone who has heard his commentaries before already knows.  It's like he's sitting there on the couch with you and telling you little tidbits of the movie as you watch along.  And the thing is, every word out of his mouth is economical.  Nothing irrelevant or rambling is spoken.  Another plus.Overall, Paramount has not let us down.  This was well worth the wait and it met or exceeded my expectations on various levels.  If you are a fan of the Godfather series, this is a must.  Even if is just for that fifth disc of bonus features.  Regardless, every disc in this set is a bonus.  Well worth the money.	5.0	Excellent DVD Set	2001-10-10	1	1	0
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2HXVZDB5Q2SZ6	Bendr1985	The Godfather trilogy, I supposed that if you were to buy the Godfather you might as well buy the whole trilogy. I thought that the sequels were not necessary. The first one was incredible, a great plot, great actors, great decade to make it in. The second movie was great also, it had somethings that made it memorable, quotes, the plot was still the same which made pretty good. The third one had to come, only because it would've been really [incomplete]... without the third one. It was a wise move.The first godfather was mostly about the leader of a mafia, and he was passing it down to his son. His son on the other hand was trying to keep out of the family business so that he could start a new life. But after the father dies the son has no choice but to assume the role as the Godfather. Al Pacino kicks ass!The second godfather was about how Michael keeps the family striving, it also shows a little bit about his father, played by Robert DeNiro. The legendary brother kiss is the only reason this movie made anything. Its what put it on the map.I dont know much about the third one, I have seen bits and pieces but it looks pretty stupid. I guess if your a godfather fan it would be useful to watch it.Well thats pretty much it... Have fun!	5.0	"Amazon makes an ""Offer you can't refuse"""	2003-12-15	5	3	2

The third is lacking, but not a disaster, and serves as a fitting conclusion to the story, for the most part.What the films have, though, is one of the greatest ensemble casts ever assembled. Brando, Pacino, Cazale, Caan, Duvall, Keaton and De Niro come together in the epic story of the violent rise and the epic, disturbing downfall of the Corleone family.Though the third film, in which the tragedy of Mary's death is downplayed somewhat by Sofia Coppola's inept performance (if only Winona Ryder hadn't had that nervous breakdown and created an emotional, compelling Mary that we could've actually cared for...), is a disappointment, the overall story is a grand one.The extras on the DVD are welcome, particularly the documentary detailing the behind-the-scenes troubles on the first and second films. Coppola, on the commentary, comes off as a bit of an egomaniac, but that bravado of his is wholly earned.This is a must-have for any collector."	5.0	From Vito's violent beginning to Michael's tragic end.	2003-01-06	9	9	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1BJOEQSRX2IBM	"Bertin Ramirez ""justareviewer"""	First of all, let me state that parts I and II are among the best american films of all time, and as flawed as part III might have been I do not agree with a lot of reviewers that say that it should not be included. I mean this is the Godfather 'collection' and as a person of sound mind one can not expect Coppola to spend another X million dollars so he can release the set with just the two movies. But enough about that, and I will go into the product itself. First of all, congratulations, the picture and sound are excellent on all 3 films, now we can truly savor Nino Rota's music and Gordon Willis' cinematography without all that artificial lighting in the TV and other versions. Great job all in all, now with the shortcomings. First of all, the extended documentary in the extra features DVD was edited by Zeotrope a company owned by Coppola and as interesting as the documentary is it neatly evades important topics. Before I go into those topics, about the documentary itself: it is interesting, but it could have been gripping, it drags in parts and is it just me or does it take too long to make its point about Coppola's insistance on Pacino playing Michael, it takes its time with Coppola explaining his casting decissions in part I but what about the other two? I'd of loved to know how he got Lee Strasberg.Now with the topics that should have not been evaded:a) I've always wanted to know this, why o why did Coppola cast his daughter to play Michael's daughter in part III. Did you know that that role was to go to Winona Ryder but after she got sick it went to Sofia? You didnt? well that was for Coppola to explain, and what did he think of later criticism on that point?b) I would have liked to see the actors responses to each Oscar ceremony, the 3-supporting-nominees of 1972 I think is very interesting.c) Where's Brando????? I can understand if you could simply NOT interview him, but put together everything you have of his and let us see him, I find him the best actor of his generation and extremely interesting. I'd give anything to know why he decided to return his Oscar that way or what he thought of Deniro's interpretarion of the young Don. And on a not so smaller note, in that case, where's De Niro?, he shows up but one cant get enough of him.d) I would have liked to know many of the 'little things' like why Clemenza 'dissapears' in the second part and why Tom Hagen similarly vanishes in the third, why Cuba in part II and the Vatican in part III, and so on. It wouldnt have taken too much time.e) I know this might seem childish but I would like to hear from everyone involved which film they liked best and why, also what they thought about working with the other actors and their performances.And many more... but on with other things, I would like to have seen at least 2 trailers on each film and some kind of interviews or something with people 'outside the family' like critics and such, I would have loved to know what Scorsese thought of them and even better... I got carried away, sorry. The deleted scenes are phenomenal, EXCELLENT, only, what's with the deleted scenes from part III, in the 'directors cut' there were supposed to be 9 extra minutes... My mind went blank all of a sudden but still, this is a great Collection well worth it, buy it if youre a real fan and not a scheptic. A 9/10 as a DVD collection with all the features, as for the movies, part I 10/10, part II 10/10, part III 9/10.

Have seen some of her directing and I think she should stay behind the camera.Ok, ok, I&#8217;m not writing this to trash Sophia (well, maybe a little) but to praise The Godfather I & II.  I was waiting for all three movies to released in a box set and was happy to get it.  I had been warned about GF III by everyone I knew but I still tried to watch it with an open mind.  Too bad it just as everyone said.  Awful.  Other than that, the new transfer is amazing, and the sound incredible!

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A212MDP6K4VJS5	"Bill Stockstill ""&#34;Bill&#34;"""	There are so many reviews on these 3 films that I will just comment on the quality of the restoration. This has to be one of the top 5, if not the best, jobs done on film restoration to date. Paramount used one of the best restoration labs in the world, owned by Warner Brothers, to restore this film only after a Kodak owned lab cleared it as being sturdy enough to run through the digitizing equipment. The whole restoration was spurred by a letter to Spielberg from Coppola asking him if he could get Paramount, who had recently been bought by Viacom if they would do a restoration on the Godfather films. The head of Paramount didn't even hesitate to cut the large check to fund the restoration. The result? Coppola says its more beautiful then he remembered it. The extent of the restoration is included on the Bonus disc. And in that the clip you will see that the filmographer instead of filming the scenes correctly exposed and then having the lab darken the frames went with shooting the scenes dark, the result being there is no detail in the black areas of the film. This explains how difficult it was to get this quality of a restoration, which meant finding the best copy available, which still left much to be desired, and going frame my frame and digitally correcting the image. What is impressive is that the WB Studio lab consulted the original filmographer. I don't know if there is an Academy Award for restoration, but if there is, I know this team deserves it.NOTE: There seems to be some here that don't like the way the film looks. I suggest they watch Emulsional Rescue - Revealing the Godfather on the bonus disc. Anyone that buys the set, may want to watch it first too to see how the films were shot, underexposed and with an orange tint, and the care taken to restore that look and even in 1 scene improve on it. Watching this feature first will show that its the way it was shot and meant to look, not the restoration.	5.0	The Gold Standard of Digital Film Restoration	2009-06-27	18	18	0

After reading through a lot of the reviews posted I hope that I may clear up a lot of the confusion and critical comments that may be discouraging anyone from buying this classic and timeless film of iconic characters. The 2 special features disc were very interesting, enlightening and enjoyable! I own the ""the godfather"" on VHS I bought a decade ago and I was under the impression that the special features from my VHS would simply be transferred to the DVD. I was completely surprised to discover everything on both discs are all never seen before features! I felt like for once a DVD that advertised never seen before special features which actually lived up to the promotion.Ok I've been hearing some viewers complaining about the color in the film. They added a bit of a tangerine color to give the movie a more warmer and updated feel which looks good in my opinion. Some people are giving the implication that the added coloring is consistent throughout the movie and its only in the scenes where its really dark or there's lighting with a shade that gives off that particular color. If you look in the area where the light shines you'll see the tangerine color and if you look at the window the coloring is very natural as daylight would look in any window. Reviewers must remember this is a movie that was filmed in 1972 and resurrecting it I'm almost certain was a difficult and delicate process, so if this is your favorite film give the studio credit for a good job in refining a film shot with old technology 35 years ago. So for the complaints about the color, I can only say to those critics to try adjusting the color settings on your TV.Complaints about noise, I did not hear any loud subway or train like noises that overwhellmed the dialogue, except the one scene where Micheal was mentally preparing himself to kill Solotso and that was done purposely. So again to those complainting about noise try adjusting the sound settings on your TV or maybe you got a defective copy.I read a couple reviews about something being on the camera midway in ""the godfather II"". I found nothing at all that was on the camera and not a part of the film, again maybe you have a defective copy. I honestly have no criticism for this gift set and in my humble opinion this film still looks like the masterpiece that it is and I strongly recommend it to anyone pondering purchasing it!!! Also to all the other complaints I've read about the special features I think its nonsense and your expectations are far too high. I hope that my genuine and honest feelings about this gift set will serve anyone who reads this review.

Just as Stanley Kubrick's highly anticipated first DVD collection was simply a joke, so is this Godfather collection. Paramount DVD's in general are poorly mastered and this collection is no exception.  Just as Warner ended up having to remaster Kubrick's DVD collection with better elements, Paramount should also consider doing the same with The Godfather.	1.0	HORRIBLE DVD TRANSFER	2001-10-12	24	13	11

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2MRNFY58NO2M	"""bogart--brando--pacino"""	First of all, let me state that parts I and II are among the best american films of all time, and as flawed as part III might have been I do not agree with a lot of reviewers that say that it should not be included. I mean this is the Godfather 'collection' and as a person of sound mind one can not expect Coppola to spend another X million dollars so he can release the set with just the two movies. But enough about that, and I will go into the product itself. First of all, congratulations, the picture and sound are excellent on all 3 films, now we can truly savor Nino Rota's music and Gordon Willis' cinematography without all that artificial lighting in the TV and other versions. Great job all in all, now with the shortcomings. First of all, the extended documentary in the extra features DVD was edited by Zeotrope a company owned by Coppola and as interesting as the documentary is it neatly evades important topics. Before I go into those topics, about the documentary itself: it is interesting, but it could have been gripping, it drags in parts and is it just me or does it take too long to make its point about Coppola's insistance on Pacino playing Michael, it takes its time with Coppola explaining his casting decissions in part I but what about the other two? I'd of loved to know how he got Lee Strasberg.Now with the topics that should have not been evaded:a) I've always wanted to know this, why o why did Coppola cast his daughter to play Michael's daughter in part III. Did you know that that role was to go to Winona Ryder but after she got sick it went to Sofia? You didnt? well that was for Coppola to explain, and what did he think of later criticism on that point?b) I would have liked to see the actors responses to each Oscar ceremony, the 3-supporting-nominees of 1972 I think is very interesting.c) Where's Brando????? I can understand if you could simply NOT interview him, but put together everything you have of his and let us see him, I find him the best actor of his generation and extremely interesting. I'd give anything to know why he decided to return his Oscar that way or what he thought of Deniro's interpretarion of the young Don. And on a not so smaller note, in that case, where's De Niro?, he shows up but one cant get enough of him.d) I would have liked to know many of the 'little things' like why Clemenza 'dissapears' in the second part and why Tom Hagen similarly vanishes in the third, why Cuba in part II and the Vatican in part III, and so on. It wouldnt have taken too much time. And I was also very intrigued by other small plot details, like what's with that twist involving Pantangelli's brother?e) I know this might seem childish but I would like to hear from everyone involved which film they liked best and why, also what they thought about working with the other actors and their performances.f) Also, the 'extra scenes' we get are all part of the 'Godfather Saga' which was edited by Coppola in chronological order both Part I and II. Save one extra scene (the one from part III) all the others were not that new. For example did you know they shot a sequence where Michael shoots down Fabrizio with his own shotgun after returning from Italy in the FIRST film? This was shot but never made the final print, it would have been extremely interesting to check these scenes out.And many more... but on with other things, I would like to have seen at least 2 trailers on each film and some kind of interviews or something with people 'outside the family' like critics and such, I would have loved to know what Scorsese thought of them and even better... I got carried away, sorry. The deleted scenes are phenomenal, EXCELLENT, only, what's with the deleted scenes from part III, there seems to be only one... My mind went blank all of a sudden but still, this is a great Collection well worth buying if you really like these movies, buy it if youre a real fan and not a scheptic. A 9/10 as a DVD collection with all the features, as for the movies, part I 10/10, part II 10/10, part III 9/10.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2ZHDCYYP1PL2K	"brewster22 ""brewster22"""	No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two &quot;Godfather&quot; films, &quot;The Conversation,&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;) and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (&quot;Peggy Sue Got Married,&quot; &quot;Bram Stoker's Dracula&quot;, the third &quot;Godfather&quot;) earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema.But before &quot;Jack&quot; there was &quot;The Godfather.&quot;  While I feel the whole &quot;Godfather&quot; trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority?  People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do).  But I think &quot;The Conversation&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire &quot;Godfather&quot; trilogy combined.Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best.  It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision.  &quot;The Godfather&quot; doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound.  It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point.  The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, &quot;The Godfather&quot; offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films.  There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again.  Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat.  But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe.  The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.My Grade---Part I: APart II: BPart III: C-	3.0	Oh, Those Corleones...	2003-08-18	5	2	3

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2EENLV6OQ3DYM	Brian D. Rubendall	Containing all three movies on four discs with a full disc of extra material, &quot;The Godfather DVD Collection&quot; is a must have for fans of Francis Ford Coppola's epic trilogy.  The movies are all there in the original versions (rather than having the scenes arranged chronologically, which the most recent VHS collection attempted to do).  On the bonus disc, among the many great extras is a generous helping of scenes that weree cut, over an hour's worth.  Some of them were understandably left out, but others provide even more insight into the motivations of the characters.  Some characters that were cut out altogether, like Tom Hagen's wife, Theresa, make their first public appearances now thirty years after the first film's release.For all of its minor flaws, the Godfather trilogy represents a truly amazing bit of filmmaking, namely nine hours of incredible imagary, acting and storytelling all taken from a pop novel that is not in any way, shape or form considered to be great literature.  The DVD format gives the movies their full due.Overall, this collection has become THE one to own for Godfather fans.	5.0	A MUST for &quot;Godfather&quot; Buffs	2002-07-20	0	0	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	ACGJQ113NCXO1	Bruce C. Erb	First off, the 2 stars rating is not for the quality of the movie.  I doubt if any of you are reading reviews to see if the Godfather is a great movie.  Its my favorite and its the favorite of a lot of you out there.  The good thing is the sound and picture are better, but the bad thing is and I have seen this among the comments already,the extra scenes that you see when Godfather is on TV are not cut in within the movies.  Instead they are on a bonus disk where you have to watch them individually.  I have seen these scenes and they add a lot to the movie, they do not make the movie too long and they explain a lot.  For example, there is a scene after Connie's wedding where they visit a dying Genco Abbondando (Vito Corleone's concilliere before Tom Hagen)in the hospital.  Its the Godfather, Johnny fontane, Hagen, and the three sons.  There is a scene at the water fountain in the hospital where Vito tells Michael that he has plans for him and that he doesn't come to him like a son should, and Michael turns away and says &quot;we'll see&quot;.  This scene really demonstrated the whole theme of the movie, as Michael goes from not wanting anything to do with the family business to becoming a lot like his father.  This and other scenes should be included, and I though for the close to 80 bucks I spent I would get that.  I was a little dissapointed.  Still, if you are a Godfather fan like me you should own this set, and some of the extras on teh Bonus DVD are interesting, especially for someone like me who has watched the movie themselves hundreds of times.	2.0	Still not Complete Movie	2001-10-13	8	6	2

Their first release will be  the late November-99 release of Coppola's Apocalypse Now, in ANAMORPHIC  widescreen! This excites me to no end, because it might just mean that one  day not too far away, we'll have ANAMORPHIC DVDs of the Godfather trilogy  and Coppola's other masterpiece (aside from the trilogy and Apocalypse  Now), The Conversation. Hopefully, he will also sit down and record  commentaries for all these movies. I believe this man owns a great deal of  knowledge about filmmaking, and of course about these movies specifically.

If there is such a person, he or she would be well advised to buy this set.  Don't believe what people say about the 3rd part being a stinker either.  It may not be quite as stellar as the first two films but it is a worthy conclusion to the film saga and is necessary to bring closure to the series.  A &quot;Who's Who&quot; of the acting world, this film trilogy uses just about anyone who became big in the 1970s as an actor plus big actors from other eras as well. There's Marlon Brando's return to the big time in the first film as the pater familias of a New York City mob family, the godfather himself.  However, even more identified with this film series is Al Pacino, who stars in all 3 films as the the godfather's son who is reluctant to enter the family business but then shows himself to have even more natural talent in it than his father did.  Robert DeNiro plays the Brando role in the 2nd film but is the &quot;young&quot; godfather starting out in New York.  He is superb.  Robert Duvall is the family lawyer in the first two films and his brash, overbearing style here is hard to imagine when juxtaposed with quieter, later roles of his, showing us the full range of his talent.  Diane Keaton as Michael's wife brings the thankless job of being a mob wife totally home. The late John Cazeles is wonderful as Michael's weak brother, Fredo.  And you see James Caan here in the role that he would play for the rest of his career, Sonny Corleone, the hot headed brother of Michael's, who doesn't have enough control over himself to take over his father's position. Artistically I think Coppola went even higher with his &quot;Apocalypse Now,&quot; &quot;One From the Heart&quot; and &quot;The Conversation&quot; but why split hairs? He's a formidable talent and most of his work, including this trilogy, shows that.	5.0	Can't Go Wrong: Riveting Films	2002-04-22	0	0	0

Marlon  Brando gives his most memorable role life; he wields incredible power that  can ultimately decide who will live and who will die, and yet he is  portrayed as a generous husband who gets fruit for his wife and a caring  grandfather who plays with his grandson in the garden.  Pacino is excellent  as the most competent son who becomes increasingly more ruthless as the  picture ensues (we see his complete transformation in the sequel) and  Duvall is also notable for his low-key but pivotal role as consigliere, who  encounters each issue with good rationality.	5.0	The Godfather of All Movies	2000-02-29	5	3	2

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A15PFCA4JXWJG3	"Christopher Cerullo ""Blu-ray Buff"""	"The first Godfather was released the year I was born (1972), but I didn't first see it until the mid-80's. Same goes for Part II ('74).Despite the criticisms when it first came out, I first appreciated the grandioseness of this trilogy when I saw Part III in '91 and I thought it was an amazing and dramatic piece of work (especially the great score and dramatic opera scenes towards the end), which then led me to want to see parts I and II. My parents gave me a great education on them when we watched them together and I realized why these are must-have films for any movie collector.My parents are retired commercial artists and they and many of their colleagues in the art field all consider the series not just ""movies"", but true works of art (particularly parts 1 and 2) and so do I!A year or two back I bought the DVD trilogy and was particularly impressed with the audio/video quality of the first 2 (part 3 was and is still relatively modern and already looked pretty good and sounded pretty darn great in VHS Hi-Fi.) But of course, the DVD was worlds ahead of the VHS (not just image-wise, but Parts I & II also went from flat mono sound to crisp-sounding 5.1, which really brought them to life) and were surely the best it could look and sound... until I watched my Blu ray last night!Now, in terms of video/audio quality, what others say here is true. First, it's not a ""reference"" Blu ray disc e.g., ""Iron Man"" or ""Transformers"". They restored the film as best they could without ""tampering"" with it. There is a good amount of film grain and a honeyish color tinge throughout that gave the film the ""sepia"" look of films from the 30s and 40s. Some will be turned off by that, but that is how Mr. Coppola intended to be.But having said that, as my headline states, seeing Part I on Blu ray truly was like seeing it for the first time!First, considering that there are so many dark scenes in the movie (purposely filmed that way and always harder for home video to reproduce) there is still an impressive amount of detail instead of the typical ""mush"" you saw in other formats. The outdoor scenes (except for the first outdoor scene at the beginning which I thought looked a tad too over-bright at times) were incredibly crisp, detailed and amazing to look at. (Especially the scenes in Italy where Michael tries to `hide' and gets married... the detail in the scenery and the colors were so amazing, I went back and watched it again!). The Dolby True-HD sound-quality is also stellar. I have a somewhat modest 5.1 home theater in a box and it sounded A-LOT newer than a 1972 film. I was impressed both by the ""crispiness"" of the treble and the fullness of the bass as well as the directionality of the sound effects. I think it definitely sounded better than the DVD version. (Imagine if I had a 7.1 HDMI receiver!). As for the special features, all the ones you loved from the DVD are in the Blu ray set, with many in HD!All in all, this is simply a no-brainer Blu ray purchase. These films could not possibly look or sound any better even if you bought a film projector and a screen! To top it all off, Amazon's unbelievable price of $52.99 for this Blu ray set is LESS than the $60 I paid for the regular DVD set!!! Buy this set right here, right now on Amazon! Other retailers are selling this same set for $85 to over $100...Thanks so much, Amazon, for making so many great Blu ray discs like these very affordable for the rest of us!"	5.0	Godfather + Blu ray = Seeing it for the first time!!!	2009-05-05	6	4	2
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2NX99GVAX4TRP	"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover"""	Here's an offer no film-buff could ever refuse. I wish I could tell you the Collection exceeded the high expectations and delivered everything anyone could ever hope for and more, but I can't quite do that.  The films look very good, but I don't think they are as perfect as they possibly could be.There is visible grain and because of how the film was shot at times it is a bit too dark.  The sound in some scenes has an overly processed feel to it and  home theatre system owners won't be overly impressed with the sound separation.  It's just not anything special.Most of the 3 hours worth of extra material on disc 5 is not comprised of brand new or unique material.  Film buffs and Godfather enthusiasts have probably seen most of  it already. It's great that it's been collected and put together on these discs, but I was yearning for something new, something that would make me say..  Wow...  For that you have the films and the feature length commentaries from Coppola -- Commentaries full of interesting, informative and fun information.The Godfather and The Godfather Part 2 represent two of the finest American films ever made.  What they represent, how they were made, the actors that appear in them all contribute to making the film's special and unique.  Too much time passed by to try and re-capture some of the glories with a Part 3, but remarkably there are moments that indicate the effort wasn't a completely worthless or wasted one.  Part 3 is a fascinating failure on several levels.The original Godfather film is a modern classic which was immediately responsible for inspiring dozens of low budget knock-offs mainly in the U.S. and Italy, a remarkable sequel (Part 2) and then several books, films and television shows such as: 'The Long Goodbye' (England); Scorcese's 'Goodfellas'; TVs Wiseguy; and HBO's Sopranos.  It also proved to be very influential to filmmakers in Hong Kong as well.  The world was alternately fascinated with and disgusted by gangsters.  The Godfather stylized and glamorized not so much the Cosa Nostra, but rather the Corleone family.  They were criminals, but they were criminals with their own morals and ethics.  They appealed to younger filmgoers because there were several parallels one could draw from The Godfather saga.  First one could see how pursuit of the American Dream led to the corruption. Second, one could surmise that a thin line separated the  gangster Corleone's from the great American political and business family dynasties.  Third, the Corleone's could be viewed as dark revolutionaries, carving out their own fortunes regardless of rules or laws.  And fourth, they were criminal's. . . bad guys.  Bad guys always seem more interesting than good guys in literature and in the movies do.  Scarface, Public Enemy and Little Caesar riveted  film audiences in the 1930's.  Some criminals became American folk heroes;  Bonnie and Clyde, and Al Capone for instance while Jesse James, the Daltons and the gunfighters both good and bad of the old west were idolized.  True crime has seemingly always carried a fascination for Americans who internationally have had reputations of being wild, unruly and dangerous.  And so Mario Puzo (and others) created the great Italian-American gangster family, The Corleones.The Godfather was given the kind of epic sweep previously reserved for historical dramas or huge classic literature adaptations.  Mario Puzo's book was a far cry from classic literature.  Puzo had lengthy sub-plots in the book, which had little to do with the life and times of  gangster father and his family.  Coppola wisely stripped the book down to its basics and based his screenplay on the family of gangster contained within the overly sensationalistic book.When one looks at film's that are called masterpieces and lauded as among the finest ever made, one should find that such films had a great impact on the intended audience (even if that impact was limited or one of initial total rejection) and an extraordinary degree of influence.  An influence whose scope transcended the intended target audience.The Godfather, and The Godfather Part 2 are two films that can make that claim.  They offer exquisite period details (1901-1959)  and introduces us to several memorable characters and Corleone  family members.  In the Godfather we have two of the greatestt performances ever captured on film -- Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.  Brando transformed himself into a mature and complex character in what amounted to a major supporting role.  Yes, he won the Best Actor award. . . but his role was really a major supporting role and not the star.  The starring role of the picture is that of the character who changes drastically over the course of the nearly 10 years the nearly three hours movie covers--Michael Corleone.  It is Al Pacino at his best.  And as impossible as it may seem, his performance is even better than Brando's is.  Even more improbable is watching Pacino deliver an even better performance in Godfather Part 2.  Perhaps the finest performance that anyone has ever given on film. A performance that failed to win an Oscar and proved  indisputably for anyone who had any doubts what little relation an Oscar win has to actual and lasting talent.You simply will not find a better performance in any motion picture in the last 30 years than the performance that Al Pacino delivers in The Godfather Part 2.  But brilliant performances don't occur in a vacuum and part of the strength of Pacino's performance is due to the performances of those around him.  Both the Godfather and Godfather Part 2 have some of the best and most memorable supporting performers and represent the strongest ensemble acting in American film.Christopher Jarmick,is the author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

As a Godfather fan, of course I've ordered this new set, BUT I can't wait for a definitive chronological edit to hit DVD someday (soon?).Previous chronlogical edits include: (1) ""Godfather 1902-1959: The Complete Epic"" which is a VHS-only 402 min. chronological edit of Parts I & II not available on DVD or laserdisc.  Doesn't include Part III (171 min.) which would take it to 573 min. total; (2) ""Godfather Trilogy: 1901-1980"" which is a Laserdisc chronological 583 min. edit of Parts I, II, & III (std 171 min. for Part III); and (3) ""Godfather Saga"" (aka Mario Puzo's The Godfather Saga: The Complete Novel for Television) which is a chronological 605 min. edit of Parts I, II, & III with added footage (434 min. for Parts I & II plus std 171 min. for Part III) done for TV broadcast only.  This version was never issued commercially in any format.  Some lucky people like me were able to record it off TV.ALL of these chronological versions are slightly different and all contain at least some footage not contained on the other versions!

I watched the first two (I probably won't watch the third one because I try to forget it exists) and everything about it was great.  It is much brighter, the colors are sharper, and visually it is just far superior to the regular DVD.  If you are a fan of the Godfather movies, this is a must buy.  My brother told me about it and I ordered it as soon as I got my blu-ray player.  The set is pricey, but well worth it in my opinion.	5.0	Fantastic restoration!!!	2010-01-30	2	1	1

Thanks to those who do this.I don't understand how people can say these Godfather Blu-Rays look good.  I was very disappointed.  I thought they did a terrible job making these Blu-Rays.  I saw these movies on Satellite in 1080i HD, and I thought they looked better.  After watching all 3 movies on Blu-Ray, I put in my DVD of the Godfather, and my intitial thought was that the DVD was better.  The DVD seems brighter, with less grain. But, then I turned on the Blu-Ray again, and decided the Blu-Ray was better, and had better detail.  But, there is not much difference between the Blu-Ray and DVD.  The Blu-Ray has more grain, but does have better detail.Amazon did change the product description to list the aspect ratio as 1.85:1, which is what it is.  2.35:1 was previously listed.How can some of the reviewers say this Blu-Ray presentation is great?

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	ACJVGDN8G386P	"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve"""	"The opening title and scene of ""The Godfather"" is one of the most striking in cinematic history. The lone trumpet invoking the tragic melody which has become so synonymous with this film is the equivalent of the tenor voice from an Italian opera, lamenting the loss of a loved-one in song, similar in style to a theme by Puccini or Verdi. Strangely, this sort of aria would have occurred towards the end of a traditional opera, usually at the death of the leading lady. But here the grieving music begins the story, as if tragic moments have already occurred, although they will continue to occur, a fundamental part of the story which is to follow. The beginning of the film is in actuality the middle of the larger epic of the Corleone family in America.The first spoken words are neither from the Godfather himself nor from one of those in his inner circle. The voice is an outsider. He is not only an outsider of the inner Corleone family but someone not originally from America. The first voice we hear is an Italian immigrant, ""I believe in America."" This is a story about American immigrants, and how they have attained great financial and political power in the United States which might not be possible elsewhere in the world.Based on the original book by Mario Puzo (who also co-wrote the screenplay), ""the Godfather"" lives up to its name as both a title referring to a specific character and simultaneously a position of someone wielding great power within a particular social context. When the film begins with Signore Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto who will be ever-remembered as the first voice and face of ""the Godfather""), the Italian immigrant requesting a favor from the Don on his daughter's wedding day, we assume the Godfather is Don Corleone (Marlon Brando), which is correct by and large. But as the film progresses, we see the rise of his younger son Michael Corleone who at first disassociates himself from the crime activities of his family. But even he cannot help but be dragged into the dealings of his family. By film's end it is ambiguous to which the titles refers, an individual person or a high-power position, not unlike a nobleman from the time of the Italian Renaissance.Strangely, traditions are portrayed in this film which have their roots centuries before the incarnation of the United States. All the main characters, with the possible exception of Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), are Catholic-Italian. The church, presumably on the outskirts of New York City, is in an architectural style similar to the medieval Gothic cathedrals of France and Italy. At the wedding at the beginning of the film, Italian songs are sung with traditional instruments. Only when a Frank Sinatra-like character, Johnny Fontane (Al Martino), appears at the wedding, do we remember we're in America in the 1940's and not a little town in Italy in the 19th century.""The Godfather"" chronicles several intertwined stories which was certainly highly innovative when it was produced. The very beginning of a plot concerns Sollozzo ""the Turk"" (Al Lettieri) who is a high-stakes heroin peddler who wants to use the Mafia families to sell his goods. He has already convinced the other Mafia families that drugs are the future but needs the Corleone family because of their political and law-enforcement connections. Don Corleone declines his offers at a meeting. But Satino ""Sonny"" Corleone (James Caan) makes a fatal slip, letting Sollozzo know there is slight ambivalence in the family about getting into the narcotics racket. Don Corleone becomes a target, and Sollozzo hopes by getting him out of the way, the Corleone family will reconsider their position on the illegal drug markets. Eventually this leads to an inter-Mafia war among the five New York families.The other story concerns Michael Corleone, his relationship with Kay Adams, presumably a WASP, and his initially tenuous relationship with his own family. Although Marlon Brando was top-billed for the film and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone has much more screen time. The film is really Michael's story, about his gradual involvement in the family business. Several of the most memorable scenes involve Michael Corleone rather than Don Corleone, not the least of which occur in the home country of Sicily when Michael is in exile.Maybe a dozen films in existence could be characterized as perfect, nearly flawless, from beginning-to-end: Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Gandhi, Schindler's List, and Malcolm X, are a few which come to mind. ""The Godfather"" not only deserves a spot, it may be at the top of the heap. Every scene, even every line, furthers story, character, and even the world of the Corleones. Each of the other actors aside from Brando and Pacino could have won an Academy Award for their efforts, including James Caan, Talia Shire, Al Lettieri, Diane Keaton, and Robert Duvall. In fact, Pacino, Caan, and Duvall were all nominated for Best Supporting Actor, maybe the only time in film history three nominees from the same film were in the same category. ""The Godfather"" is one of the bona fide epic masterpieces of cinematic history, an opera without the singing."	5.0	America's Closest Equivalent to a Tragic Italian Opera	2011-08-06	1	1	0

I can't remember the last time you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee, even though my wife is godmother to your only child. But let's be frank here. You never wanted my friendship. And you feared to be in my debt.Bonasera: I didn't want to get into trouble.Don Corleone: I understand. You found paradise in America. You had a good trade, you made a good living. The police protected you and there were courts of law. So you didn't need a friend like me. Now you come and say &#34;Don Corleone, give me justice.&#34; But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me &#34;Godfather.&#34; You come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder - for money.Bonasera: I ask you for justice.Don Corleone: That is not justice. Your daughter is alive.Bonasera: Let them suffer then as she suffers.[the Don is silent]Bonasera: How much shall I pay you?[the Don turns away dismissively, but Bonasera stays on]Don Corleone: Bonasera, Bonasera, what have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you'd come to me in friendship, this scum who ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if by some chance an honest man like yourself made enemies they would become my enemies. And then, they would fear you.Bonasera: Be my friend...

But until that day, consider this justice a gift on my daughter's wedding day.[a gratified Bonasera offers his thanks and leaves]Don Corleone: [to Hagen] Give this job to Clemenza.

The Godfather is one of my favorite movies and I had hoped to add this selection to my DVD collection for many years to come.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	What can you say that hasn't already been said? Classic films on dvd. In fact, Godfather and Godfather II are so good, they're on imdb.com's Top 10 list for best films of all time. III I'll get to in a minute.The Godfather: The start of it and my personal favorite. Featuring superb acting on Marlon Brando's part and Al Pacino(watch when he accepts his role as the new leader, before he doesn't want anything to do with the mafia, next he's very cruel and cold). After Vito Corleone's daughter's wedding, there's an attempted hit on Vito but he lives. After exacting revenge, Michael gets drawn into the life of the mafia. A bit more brutal then it's sequel, to me this is the best.The Godfather Part II: Kind of confusing and a bit long feeling, but if you're ever in an argument about good sequels, like the one in Scream 2, mention this. Lot of them will agree. This is a story seperated in 2: Michael's assassination attempt and him figuring out who ordered it and the trial his family has to do. Second is Vito Corleone(played extremely well by Robert De Niro, if you close your eyes in some scenes, you can swear you heard Marlon Brando talking) and his ascension as the Don of the Corleones. While not my favorite of the 3, it's a great watch.The Godfather Part III: This, well, this is a mixed bag. The plot is rather jumpy and several characters aren't included, but having some good acting(especially on Al Pacino's part). The ending you'll think about long after you watch it. At the end, an attempt(again) on Michael fails but one does get killed: his daughter, Mary. His &quot;silent scream&quot; is rather heartbreaking to watch. I'm sure someone was so overwhelmed with grief and pain that you can't even say something. At the end, old Michael, all alone, collapses and dies in his chair, thinking of the women in his life and the mistakes he's made and his failed attempts to change them. Despite not saying one word, it's such a tragic ending.Well Part III is flawed(I said flawed, it's not one of the worst movies to me) and II is confusing, this is the mob movie standard for which others will be judged	5.0	Essential for your collection(spoilers for Part III)	2003-08-05	2	1	1

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3OEECMCM2T4KQ	C. Middleton	"The Godfather by Mario Puzo is one of the best selling novels of all time, but its film adaptation, (1972) directed by the young filmmaker, Francis Coppola, set a new benchmark in epic filmmaking. What set this film apart from its contemporaries was its absolute realism and true depiction of the rise of the Sicilian mob in New York circa early twentieth century. Vito Carleone (Marlon Brando) right at the start of the film in the opening sequence at his daughter's wedding portrayed a man of few words, and the subtle presence of considerable danger.As the undertaker requests the Godfather's help to avenge his daughter's beating, Carleone appears puzzled. He asks, ""Why do you not ask for my friendship? Why have I not been invited for coffee at your home with your wife? Only now, when you need something, do you come to me? Why is this?"" These people are no mere thugs. The Sicilian tribal warfare and their absolute `will to power' has been going on for a thousand years. Carleone knew that the undertaker needed his strong arm and influence. But he pulled the undertaker into his world: first demanding respect, then telling the desperate man that when he was needed for a favour, he would be there. Thus the deal was done. He was now part of the family.Godfather Part 1 is a beautiful film and a graphic depiction of violence and the culture of the early American-Sicilian. We see the fall of Vito Carleone and the unexpected rise of his son, Michael, (Al Pacino) as he avenges the attempted assassination of his father. Michael becomes the Godfather and Part 1 brilliantly comes to a close.Most film critics at the time of Part 2's release praised the picture and lauded its acting and skilful storytelling. Part 2 moves from preset time to the past, revealing Vito Carleone's humble beginnings, played with brutal skill by Robert DeNiro. What is interesting is the central motif of the tale is of the son becoming the father -(the fathers sins become the sons) Michael was never meant to do the family business. He was an ethical young man, obeying his father's wish by becoming a lawyer, but joining the army. (Against his wishes) Michael's transformation from an innocent to a cold-blooded Godfather is astounding.Godfather Part 3, though nominated for seven academy awards, was a critical failure. However this writer disagrees, as the story focuses on Michael's success and his reflections about his life. He knew what he had done, including the murder of his own brother, and wanted some kind of redemption. He tries to make everything right, but he finally pays the ultimate price: the closing scenes of the film are one of the most heart wrenching and dramatic in cinematic history. Pacino should have won the Oscar that year, but again they passed him by until many years later.The Godfather Trilogy is a collection of quality filmmaking that should be part of anyone's DVD library because the story continues to resonate and will continue to do so for a long time."	5.0	The Sins of the Father become the Sins of the Son	2006-06-05	6	6	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A342VZ2G4VRCG9	CPR	Wow! Great job by Francis Ford Coppola. Family tree segment on the 5th disc is awesome. Clears up lots of debateable questions; e.g., who is the oldest son?, or how old was Sonny when he died? Only possible complaint is that I love &quot;The Complete Epic, 1902-1959&quot;. I wish FFC would have made a chronological version, including all the outtakes from the NBC TV version. Godfather 3 counts in name only. The first 2 are the greatest American movies of all time. If Bush had &quot;Genco&quot; as his consigliere, Afghanistan would be a hole on the map. Widescreen 16:9, closed caption, digital 5.1 sound, and the best organized crime characters ever, make this a must have.The closed captioning, permits you to hear lines, you never heard before. Incidentally, the TV closed captioning and the DVD subtitles are different; i.e., the title of my review. Unless you use the TV version, you don't see that line on the screen. Oh well. On a scale of 10, it's a 9&amp;1/2, because nothing is perfect. That said, go buy the DVD collection, and enjoy it as much as I have.	5.0	&quot;Anthony's friends' are your buttonmen&quot;	2001-10-15	1	0	1
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1I1G5V7ARKEWM	"""cra-zee"""	The Godfather trilogy is a great DVD set and has a bonus disc jammed packed with extra scenes, pictures, interviews, that will take you all night to watch.  The sound is excellent, I don't have a digital TV so I can really tell a definitive difference between the visuals, although for the most part the DVD's looked excellent, especially in pan scan format.  I liked the commentary by Francis Ford Copolla in the 2 Channel Dolby Surround format, with his comments on the events of the movie, while the movie is playing in the background, such as when Michael goes to see his father in the hospital, to create suspense, they wanted shots of empty hallways, but since they were pressed for time and money they put in the ends of scenes, like when Michael walked up the steps, the empty steps scene was frozen and placed later in the scene for suspense. My only problem with the DVD set is that there are scratches in the video, they didn't clean it up enough, so it looks like the beginning of a movie in a theater. This doesn't last the whole movie though, it comes and goes, and when it goes, it is a perfect picture.  Conclusion, great DVD, great Extras, Some Problems, Overall, worth the Amazon.com price.	4.0	Fantastic Movies and Great Extras	2001-11-24	0	0	0
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AS9O64VWVZNXV	Crazy Canuck	This is currently the most definitive version of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece, until he or Paramount Pictures should decide to release any anniversary updates in the future.  Because both the Godfather and Godfather Part II had been digitally restored and 5.1 Dolby Digital sound mastered in place of the original mono sound, this restoration edition is the prettiest looking and best sounding of the Godfather trilogy you've seen.  The tonnes of extra features on two bonus discs themselves are worth the price of admission.  For those who already bought previous editions of the movie trilogy, a double or triple dip may not be tempting. This was my first purchase of the Godfather trilogy.  Unfortunately, I bought the DVD version because I didn't own a Blu-ray player then.  So while the Blu-ray version is definitely the recommended version for first-time buyers of the Godfather trilogy, I'm happy with my DVD set (except for some disc error on one of the bonus disks when trying to play the trailers for the Godfather and Godfather Part II) and won't double-dip for the Blu-ray version because except for the upgraded picture and sound quality, everything is the same in the DVD version.  Too bad I bought it too early or I would have gone for the Blu-ray version.	5.0	Most Definitive Edition of Coppola's Masterpiece	2011-01-22	0	0	0
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3DV9SAGABU5OD	crazycassie	I love the Godfather trilogy! The Godfather movies and Goodfellas are my favorite gangster movies. So this is what I have to say about this dvd set of the Coppola Restoration.  I just absolutely can't believe how clean the Godfather movies look compared to how they looked when each of them premeired. The Godfather I and II looked like they were made yesterday because There are absolutely no scratches, blemishes, discoloration or color fading. The Godfather III looks really wonderful to considering it's not as old as the first two. The restoration must have been really expensive to make the movies look this good. The bonus features are really good to, even though they were passed over from the previous dvd edition. The one thing that could have been good, though, was if they put back the original Paramount logos from the 1970s for the  Godfather I and II, but I don't think it really matters, because the movies look nice and clear anyways.  Like I said, the restoration the the Godfather trilogy is wonderful! I wish all old movies between 1920 and 1990 look as nice as this restoration of the Godfather classics!	5.0	The Best DVD versions of the Godfather Series EVER!	2012-05-02	2	2	0

Does that mean that you should purchase this 5 disc collection? - that depends.While I haven't gone through all five disks yet this is what I can share with those of you who are considering purchasing the collection.  Francis Ford Coppola's commentary on the first two films is terrific - both interesting and entertaining.  He discusses his troubles with studio execs and scene by scene mentions many interesting and revealing points.  For example,  the L.A. scenes in the movie were all second units and not done with the principal actors.  The cat in Marlon Brando's lap in the opening scene was improv.  Some scenes during the Wedding that look like bright sunshine were actually shot at night because studio ""watchers"" had told Coppola that he needed to stop shooting that day.  The scene where Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) is rehearsing the lines of thanks for being invited to the wedding ... was done after Lenny could not say the lines well in front of  Marlon Brando.  So they put the scene where Luca is rehearsing the lines so that we are in on the fact that Brasi is nervous. ... (and on and on).The print is good but not great.  I have no idea why a studio like Paramount could not clean up the spots/grain on the film better a la Rear Window.  Probably just another opportunity to release a better version down the road and make some more money off this thing.Extras are well listed here at ...(the website).  But of special note is the ""Up Close"" or behind the scenes if you will.  There you can witness the improv of Coppola with some pretty young actors at the time .. Pacino, Duval, Caan etc.Hope this helps ..."	4.0	Worth Considering for the extras	2001-10-10	1	1	0
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A21B2TJBWCSK1R	Cubist	"The new transfers for The Godfather Parts I and II are stunning. It really is like seeing them for the first time. All of the murky, faded colors have been restored to their original glory while still retaining the warmth of the film stock. Gordon Willis' then-controversial cinematography can finally be seen they way it was intended on these new discs. If you have the original box set, it is worth it to double dip if only for the restoration job on these two films.Carried over from the original set are all of Francis Ford Coppola's commentary tracks for the three films. On The Godfather one, he appropriately enough, starts off by talking about the film's famous opening scene and how it was supposed to start with the wedding but a friend suggested he do something else. Coppola talks about how he organized the elaborate wedding sequence and shot it only 2-3 days! He talks about the pressure he was under by the studio and in read danger of being fired because they didn't like what he was doing. This is pretty solid track that we've come to expect from the veteran filmmaker.Coppola's contributes another excellent commentary for The Godfather Part II. Initially, he had no interest in doing a sequel and dealing with studio bureaucracy. He suggested Martin Scorsese for the job. The studio balked at this idea and accepted all of Coppola's terms. The veteran filmmaker talks at length about the development of the Corleone family from Part I. Coppola is engaging and very articulate, delivering a top notch track that is well worth a listen for any fan of this movie.Finally, there is Coppola's commentary for The Godfather Part III. One of the heated debates the filmmaker had with the studio was over Pacino's hair. He wanted Michael to look older and like a man in crisis, while the studio didn't want to mess with Pacino's distinctive looks. Coppola defends his casting of Sofia and feels that she delivered a ""real"" performance because she wasn't an actor. He also addresses the scathing criticism she received as in fact an attack on him. This is a solid track with good observations and analysis by Coppola -- better than the film itself.The rest of the supplemental material is spread out of two discs. Thankfully for those who did not buy the first box set all of the extras from it have been carried over with a whole other disc of brand new material.The fourth disc features all the brand new material and starts off with ""Godfather World,"" which takes a look at how The Godfather films influenced popular culture, including parodies on The Simpsons and South Park, and how it informed the characters on The Sopranos. All kinds of celebrities, from William Friedkin and Alec Baldwin to author Sarah Vowell who sing its praises with clips of shows and films that reference it.""The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn't"" tells the story of how Hollywood had changed at the end of the 1960s with the demise of the studio moguls and the rise of the film brats, the first generation of film students who became filmmakers. One of them, Coppola, ended up being picked to direct The Godfather. This is an excellent look at how the director almost didn't get the gig and why.""...When the Shooting Stopped"" examines the post-production phase of the first film. Coppola battled with the studio over the length of it. Executives initially did not like Nino Rota's score for the film and samples of some of his original and revised cues are played.""Emulsional Rescue: Revealing The Godfather"" takes a look at the newly restored transfers for Part I and II and how they preserve Gordon Willis' gorgeous cinematography. This featurette takes us through the restoration process, showing before and after examples.""The Godfather on the Red Carpet"" is a forgettable featurette shot during the premiere of Cloverfield with various minor celebrities gush about the films.""Four Short Films on The Godfather"" features celebs citing which one they prefer, Part I or II. Another one has Richard Belzer, and the man who adapted the films for the stage, quote their favourite lines, which turns out to be quite funny. The third one sees Coppola talk about his love of cannoli and how made it into the film. Finally, Coppola answers the question about what happened to Clemenza in Part II and why he died.The fifth disc starts off with ""A Look Inside,"" a feature-length documentary about The Godfather trilogy done when Part III was being made. As a result, a lot of the major players were interviewed. We see Coppola at work on this film with on-set footage of the director working with Pacino. We also see Coppola working on the script with author Mario Puzo. The doc then goes back to the first film with Coppola's battle with the studio over casting Brando, Pacino, et al. with fascinating vintage screen tests and rehearsal footage. This is an excellent extra that goes into great detail.""On Location"" revisits key locations in the lower east side of New York where they shot parts of all three films and how they transformed them into various historical periods.""Francis Coppola's Notebook"" examines how he adapted Puzo's book into the first film. Coppola shows us his notebook that he used as his master document that he would constantly refer to. This featurette provides fascinating insight into the man's creative process.""Music of The Godfather"" features an audio excerpt of a conversation Coppola had with composer Nino Rota about the music for the film. Also included is footage of composer Carmine Coppola (Francis' father) working on Part III. Francis talks about working with his father.""Coppola and Puzo on Screenwriting"" features the author talking about the origins of his novel while Coppola discusses adapting it with Puzo into the films.""Gordon Willis on Cinematography"" features the man talking his approach to the look of the film and the choices he made and why.""Storyboards - Godfather Part II and Part III"" allows you to see sketches for the look of both films and see how Coppola planned to shoot them.""The Godfather: Behind the Scenes 1971"" is a vintage promotional featurette done at the time of the production of the first film. This is a fantastic snapshot of the times.""The Filmmakers"" are text biographies of key crew members.Also included are 30 additional scenes from the four eras, spanning the entire trilogy. Much of this footage was inserted into the first two films when they were shown on television.""The Family"" gives you a handy organization chart for the Corleone family. You can see who everyone is and how they are related.Finally, there are ""Galleries"" with trailers for all three films, stills, a collection of portraits of enemies of the Corleone family, and footage of the Academy Awards wins for the first two Godfather films."	5.0	The New Restoration Collection does not disappoint!	2008-09-22	596	583	13
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1R1FS4JE7WNAM	cwileyy	This movie is one of the best ever made. Pretty much every one knows this, and even if someone doesn't agree, they know that pretty much everyone else thinks so. This being the case, I don't think it's too necessary to discuss the film's merits.All three films look amazing. The best they ever have. The first DVD release was a huge improvement in picture quality and clarity over the VHS, and this Blu-ray takes it even further.The picture looks perfect. For years, the image was murky, and a bit too dark, but here it is brought back to the way it was meant to be seen.Now, I know no one likes The Godfather Part III, and because of this, some people may instead opt to go for the standalone versions of The Godfather and The Godfather Part II in order to save a few bucks. But, considering the wealth of special features, most of which are not available on the standalone sets, the extra few dollars for this set is worth it.The only thing I wish this set has was the edited-for-TV version of The Godfather Parts I & II, as it would be cool to sometimes have the option to watch those two movies in chronological order.Otherwise, this is a great set.	5.0	A Classic Looks Its Best	2012-12-05	1	1	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2SJU6MCH3HBEL	Danny	Every movie buff has seen or at least heard of this phenomenon of a movie. Coppola really shows his true colors with this one and out-does himself in every way, making something as simple as a conversation at a Bronx  Restaurant and making it one of the greatest scenes in film history. Pacino  and Brando shine in a wonderful cast including James Caan, Robert Duvall  and Diane Keaton. All these virtuous points gone along with Gordon Willis'  beautiful cinematography and Nino Rota's unforgettable score come together  to form one of the most brilliant and provocative crime stories ever made.  Some people get enough backbone to actually falsely call this movie  &quot;boring and too long.&quot; No, folks. That's Gone With The Wind.  People might have probably expected blood-o-rama with this one since it's a  mob movie, but in fact it's not really so much a mafia movie as it is a  movie about family. The violence and blood are only references explaining  as to why the Corleones face so many problems. Why Michael had to leave the  country, why Johnny Fontaine got the role, why Brando decided to end the  war. Considered by many to be the greatest film ever (and rightly so), this  baby is ranked on mostly every major top 10 film list around the country.  Do I reccomend it? Highly. Even if you haven't seen it, it's definetely  worth buying.	5.0	It's Coppola. Need I Say More?	2000-02-06	6	5	1

Anyone would run out of superlatives to describe just what an asset Marlon Brando is to a film. Al Pacino is the x factor. His steely and cold-blooded portrayal of youngest son Michael Corleone makes the movies. The third movie should have picked up where the second movie left off albeit allowing for the passage of time, but instead gives us this unnecessarily convoluted beginnings of Vito Corleone which would have served us and the movies better if presented in the first. The third movie brought my rating down for those reasons because I'm rating as a set, otherwise the rating is higher. Still, I recommend this set because for two thirds, it is magnificent movie entertainment.	3.0	Lost in translation	2014-02-15	1	1	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AEMZRE6QYVQBS	David A. Baer	This breathtaking classic of American film-making frames Francis Ford Coppola as one of the all-time great cinematic craftsmen.Having inexplicablyl missed out on this piece of Americana at the time of its popularity, this reviewer bought the three-film set in time to finish it just after his fiftieth birthday. It was worth the wait.This epic saga of a mob family that cannot escape the burden of honor no matter how hard it tries (or, at times, fails to try) does not glorify gangsters or their ways. To the contrary, we grow to pity Michael Corleone for the centuries-old Sicilian trap into which he has unwittingly fallen.Along the way, gorgeous cinematography delights both eye and ear even as it saddens the soul. The Corleone family, and Michael in particular, passes through the various autumns of their fate en route to the ignoble demise of Il Padrino in his sunlit chair. He is old, bereft, and apparently forgotten.It is a quite splendid sadness that this trilogy leaves in its majestic wake. Evil is not so much a roaring lion as the end game of a thousand small decision, any one of which might have changed the game.

This box set is an exceptional release.  ""Part II"" is my personal favorite, but ""Part I"" is not far behind.  ""Part III,"" despite some ludicrous hit scenes and Sofia Coppola's atrocious acting, is not as bad as many have said (it has a terrific finale).  The extra features are fantastic!  Coppola's commentary is compelling, revealing many fascinating details about the making of the films, the people involved, and his own battles with the studio.  It may be expensive, but the sheer rewatchability of these films and the plethora of extras promise many hours of viewing pleasure."	5.0	An American epic	2002-02-09	1	0	1

What might be a surprise is the ""Godfather."" It only ranks third, and ""Godfather II"" only ranked 32.  To those of us who collect movies, study them, discuss them and even write about them, whether its professionally or as a hobby, very few would argue the Godfather isn't the best movie of all time.  Maybe the R rating kept is from its deserving number one ranking. Only the members of AFI know for sure. Think about it, for two generations we really believed that the Corleones existed, and some still do! The Godfather is the only film to have its sequel make the AFI top 100 list. This VHS set is a must for all who enjoy movies.  For those waiting for the DVD version, well, no release date is in sight.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A20Q4HD6A2B8W9	Dennis Brandt	The Blue-Ray version of I leaves much to be desired.  Dark scenes are REALLY dark and lack detail.  Colors lean toward an annoying yellow-orange tint.  II is a bit better but not much.  III is the best visually.  Given that many films from the same period as I and II look beautiful, I find this puzzling.  Coppola's real-time discussion of the first movie is fascinating in portraying yet another studio that was too stupid for its own good and nearly screwed up one of the greatest films of all time.  Godfather I is a fabulous film, if disquieting in its subject matter, but I wish Coppola would have incorporated the deleted scenes he included on a television version.  I was less enamored of II, which didn't know if it wanted to be a prequel or a sequel, so it did both and suffered for it.  I would have preferred a full prequel and made GFIII as the sequel.  Its higher operational budget is apparent, but the film is less satisfying.  Much more complex than Godfather I, I was often unable to discern the good bad guys from the bad bad guys.  Many have bashed III unmercifully, but I am not one of them.  It is the most disquieting of the three given its involving the Catholic Church and incorporating real events.	3.0	Godfather I gets 5 stars and II gets 4, but . . .	2008-10-29	6	1	5

Since The Godfather Parts I and II are two of the greatest movies of all-time, and also my two favorite movies of all time, I couldn't wait for this to be released. I'm sad to say it leaves me slightly disappointed. There was no ""wow factor"". It does not look a whole lot better than the original DVD collection. The main difference in Part I is, the restored version has a much brighter tone to it. Part II has more vibrant color. Part III looks almost the same as the original DVD. If these were DVD's, I'd say they were excellent. But for Blu-ray, they just aren't much better than an up-converted DVD. If I were going to show off my home theater system, these definitely wouldn't be the disks to use.With all that being said, being a Godfather fanatic, it was still worth it to me.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3EJYJC25OJVKK	"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer"""	This DVD collection is an absolute must-have for those who love The Godfather trilogy. Quite simply this is likely one of the greatest sagas ever produced, novel and moviewise.The first Godfather from 1972 is considered the greatest movie ever made and while I sometimes question it being 'THE' best movie of all time, there's no doubt on my mind that this is indeed on of the best movies of all time and a cinematic achievement like never before. Starring the late great Marlon Brando, it's the story of the head of the Corleone family named Vito who has made many business dealings with gambling and criminal enterprise and his son Michael Corleone wants nothing to do with the criminal Underworld but when Vito is critically wounded in a failed mob assassination attempt, Michael is unwillingly pulled into the mob underworld.The second Godfather movie is like almost no other movie because it serves as both a sequel as well as a prequel to it's predecessor. Set in the late 1950s Michael COrleone who was pulled inot the mob underworld has been setting his grip as the Don of the Corleone family and has transformed into a cold-hearted crminial mastermind. At the same time we flash back to the 1900s through the early 1920s where Vito Corleone's background and past come to light and we witness his rise to power and how it really shows Vito from a totally different light from the first Godfather movie.The third and finale of the three is the most controversial and most unfairly criticized of the three. An aging Michael Corleone who has had a very dark past has been making links to the Vatican and has been trying to redeem himself from his past sins and wrongdoings but has been held back by younger gangsters who aim to take over the business and criminal enterprise from Michael and prevent his son from inheriting it. This finale is the darkest and the most depressing of the three and perhaps that's why it's the least favorite of the three by many but for me, this is nonetheless a really great conclusion to one of the best saga's ever done.To really understand these movies you will need a lot of patiences and they need to be seen in order in order to understand what they are about but if it succeeds, these are ultimately highly rewarding classics that will never grow tiresome. This DVD collection is highly recommended.	5.0	A truly essential must-have collection!	2004-09-12	1	1	0

With the awesome quality of most blu-ray movies being released today, it is easy to get spoiled. Older films rarely look truly hi-definition when compared to current releases. However, when it is a truly great film like this, I do not mind spending money on yet another version of the same movie, provided it is significantly better than the previous versions. All too often this is not the case. Here the studio has done an exemplary job of restoring the original film. I never saw it in the theater, but I cannot imagine it looked any better at my neighborhood theaters back then. This film will always deserve 5 stars as a movie. However, this 5-star review is for the restoration!	5.0	Great movie. Best restoration yet.	2008-11-24	0	0	0

Having just seen them again for the first time in about fifteen years, I was newly overwhelmed by their power and  impressed by the skill of the filmmakers and the actors in putting together  these great epic sagas of power, blood, love, betrayal, and vengeance.That said, I cannot to this day fathom what Francis Ford Coppola was  thinking when he put together &quot;The Godfather--Part III.&quot;  Sprawling, poorly crafted, murky, and ultimately dull, this third  installment in the series remains one of the biggest disappointments in  modern film making. The casting of Sofia Coppola as Michael Corleone's  daughter Mary was a production gaffe of monumental proportions. She was  such an unappealing character portrayed so amateurishly  by Coppola that  when the climatic scene unfolds on the screen, one can't help but feel a  bit of relief, rather than horror or sadness.Still, the first two films  rank among the very finest movies ever produced, and young people who  missed the films during their initial releases owe it to themselves to see  them on video.	5.0	The first two films are so good we should forgive the third	2000-01-08	9	7	2

Do you really want Godfather III?  Of course not, but you're essentially forced to buy it because you can't get the other two without buying the whole set.  In the long run, we'll all buy the set anyway.  But it just seems silly that you can't buy each film on its own.It's a raw deal unworthy of the best American movie ever made, the orginal ""Godfather.""  It's the best because, simply put, it's more entertaining than ""Citizen Kane.""  And it's better than Part II because it illustrates the dramatic change in Michael Corleone's character.  That's what's at the heart of the original, and that makes it a fascinating character study in and of itself (on top of everything else, of course).  Part II is, essentially, an exploration into Michael's descent into evil.  But without that transformation of character, the film lags a bit over its gargantuan length.  You tend to yearn for more of De Niro's scenes as the younger Don Corleone.  Yet Part II is terminably watchable, as much so as its predecessor.As for Part III, it feels even more like it's been tacked on, unnecessarily, to the original.  I'd rather have my own imagination to envision the string playing out for the entire Corleone family, and the inexplicable addition of George Harrison to the film series makes the Part III even sillier.In the end, it's all about the first two films, and you shouldn't have to pay through the nose for an extra film you don't want.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2TQP2XVQE0XG9	"""drownedinnails"""	The Godfather series have long been heralded among the greatest pieces of american cinema. First reviews of the films:1.) Godfather: (11 out of 10). A classic of cinema and #3 on the AFI's 100 greatest movies list. It's also my favorite movie of all time. Marlon Brando gives a legendary performance as Don Vito Corleone, the head of the Corleone mafia family. From his hoarse, mumbling voice to his cheeky face, Brando created one of the most famous and often parodied charcters in film history. Another special contribution this film gave to pop culture was introducing Al Pacino. Pacino is great in his signature role as the Don's son, Michael. He shows in his portrayl the transformation of Michael from a war hero into a ruthless mobster. The supporting cast are all fantastic as well. James Caan as the hot-tempered Sonny, Robert Duvall as consigliere Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Michael's wife, Kay Adams and the late John Cazale as Fredo Corleone to name a few. The Godfather had many memorable scenes such as the horses's head lying in a man's bed, the shootout at the restaurant or the massacre of Sonny Corleone. And who could forget Marlon Brando's famous line : I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.This movie also gave the audience insight into family life inside the mob and how these people stay close to one another despite being low life criminals.2.) The Godfather part 2: (10 out of 10). Brilliant sequel which is equal to the original in it's epic scope. This movie tells two stories. The sequel part shows us Michael moving his newly established crime organization and family to Lake Tahoe. The prequel part takes us back in time to when the young Vito Corleone (played brilliantly by Robert De Niro) rose to power in the slums of New York. Al Pacino gives another great performance as Michael, as does Diane Keaton as his now-suffering wife Kay and Robert De Niro manages to channel Marlon Brando with his own portrayl of the Don. John Cazale manages to make the audience feel sympathetic as Michael's pathetic brother, Fredo who pays the price for betraying his brother.3.) The Godfather part 3: ( 8 1/2 out of 10). 16 years later, Francis Ford Coppola and author, Mario Puzo returned to conclude the story of the Corleones. The film did not do so well at the box office or at the Oscars despite being nominated. It also became the butt to several jokes and the target of constant bashing from movie buffs. While the film isn't an oscar caliber masterpiece like the first two, it's not as bad as people make it out to be. The film's main flaw is the meandering plot and the numerous sub-plots going on at once. Robert Duvall's absence hurts the film as the Tom Hagen character was so prominent in the first two. The film concerns Michael's decison to become a legitimate businessman by entering into a deal with the Vatican bank to keep them from becoming bankrupt. He finds that the church is just as corrupt as the mafia. Al Pacino is once again great as an eldery Don, and Diane Keaton returns as his now estranged wife. Andy Garcia is great as Sonny's illegitimate son, Vincent who becomes the new Don Corleone. Sofia Coppola, while not great as Mary, doesnt ruin the movie like so many critics and reviewers make it to be. The Godfather part 3 needs to be seen with knowledge of the first two films to make sense. Even though it didn't live up to the first two, it was still a worthy conclusion.Bonus Material: This disc has a lot of great stuff on it. From the many deleted scenes to the making of documentaries, this disc is a great addition to the movies themselves.	5.0	Godfather  DVD review	2004-01-26	3	2	1
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A106YXO3EHVD3J	"DR SHOCK ""MR. KIA RETURNS! ;-b"""	I have seen 'The Godfather' films so many times I've lost count. I also own the 6 VHS director's cut which puts the three films together in chronological order and adds well over an hour of great footage (My favorite cut by far!). I was contemplating buying the new restored Blu Ray edition and I'm very glad I decided to go ahead and buy it.Like a lot of other reviewers have stated the films look better than they ever did, but naturally they do not look like state of the art films made recently. The Blu Ray version is a very noticeable improvement and the films look bright and as clear as they will probably ever look. Coppola wanted a certain grainy look and to remove it completely would be like scrubbing the grit out of The Rolling Stones classic album 'Exile On Main Street'!Of course I'm talking mainly about the first film as part II looks better although many scenes are still a little dark.  Part III looks exceptional and helps the overall experience of the film since it is by far the least of the three. The extras disc is full of hours of good stuff for hard core fans to navagate through including the extras from the 2001 DVD release which was a nice addition.The first film is the greatest mob film ever made with the second film rating a very close second (maybe a tie with 'Goodfellas for second place?). Part II has a much more ambitious story and probably deserves top seed, but the character's of Don Vito(Marlon Brando), Tessio(Abe Virgoda), Clemenza(Bruno Kirby) and Sonny(James Caan)are sorely missed in part 2. That's not to say that the second film doesn't have great characters, I just prefer the original characters to the characters in part II.What is incredible is the casting of Don Vito(Robert DeNiro), Clemenza(Bruno Kirby) and Tessio(John Aprea) in part II, it's very believable that these young guys are those older guys in the first film. The very underrated John Cazale gives a fantastic performance in part II as Fredo. As good as Pacino is in these films, he is not very likable and I find the other characters more appealing and interesting. I could have watched an entire film just following the young Don, Clemenza and Tessio for part II.I know the third film has been bashed to bits, but how could part III have not been a disappointment? With what it had to live up to, it's surprising it was ever made. I have grown to like it more over the years. If only Duvall and Coppola could have come to a money agreement, I think the film would have been much better. For one it would have added another brilliant actor in the film and maybe that would have forced Coppola to edit out some of the religious overload.If you have a Blu Ray player this is a must have as these films will probably never look better. My only gripe is they should have made this a deluxe box set with the director's cut of all three films included too, it has never seen a DVD release. I guess, I won't be retiring my VCR just yet. It's an amazing piece of work with a lot of stuff that was cut out of the original films. I'm not talking throw away stuff either, it's as close to watching a book as you'll ever get. Hopefully they will release it someday soon!	5.0	LOOKS GREAT ON BLU RAY IF ONLY THE THREE FILM DIRECTOR'S CUT WAS INCLUDED!	2014-05-08	3	2	1

This was the apex of what American cimema was and still is today.  ""The Godfather"" was perhaps the best three hours you can spend sitting very still and for a good reason. This was one of the top ten films of 1972 and it was a huge success at the boxoffice. This was ""the ultimate gangster film"",and a ""cultural phenomenon"" that still holds true. This was an ""absolutely flawless"",an ""American epic"" based on the best selling novel by Mario Puzo and directed by Francis Ford Coppula. It recounts the ""operatic"" lives of the Corleone family via through its ""intricate"" plot,bravura ""photography"" from cimematopgrapher Gordon Willis and ""iconic performances"" from actors Marlon Brando,Al Pacino Diane Keaton,Robert Duvall,James Caan,John Cazale,and Sterling Hayden. This was the film that depicted the cold side of the mafia life and it was never shown before and it also gave Brando an Oscar in 1972 for Best Actor and it also won Best Picture honors for that same year.  In fact,the end result is so ""killer"" that ""nothing comes even close-except the sequel that followed it which basically picks up where the first part of ""The Godfather"" left off.  ""The Godfather:Part Two""-picks up where the first installment of Mario Puzo's epic novel left off. It was a ""real rarity-a sequel as good as the original""-this ""true masterpiece"" stands on its own laurels as it delves deeper into the Corleone family saga from the early life of a younger Vito Corleone played by Robert De Niro in a breathtaking performance that is not to be missed,to the family's transactions within the organization. It is a moody meditation on the emptiness of power,it's complex plot through its masterfully intercuts that gives us two stories separated by a half-century into a taut heartbreaking tale of innocence lost and though never overshadowing its bigger brother which in turn doesn't go overboard within the boundaries of the book. But it is even more subtle and sublime with some chilling moments between the relationship between Michael and his cousin Fredo. A supporting brilliant cast with includes Al Pacino,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton,John Cazale it won six Oscars including Best Picture of 1974 and also directing honors for Francis Ford Coppula. At over three and a half hours it is grand Hollywood entertainment that is worthy of the title."	4.0	30 years later	2008-09-30	0	0	0

The entire process takes several days. Here's why: each film has a running commentary by Francis Coppola that runs the length of each film. The three films runs about 9 hours, but the commentaries double even that long running time. On top of that there are even more extras. Coppola talks a lot about all three films, and it's a very engaging listen. (Yes, he talks about Sofia's performance in III).So, putting aside the fact that I and II are among the greatest American films of the 20th Century, it's actually pretty cost efficient entertainment investment, too.For trivia buffs, I offer the following: In III, there is a montage of newspapers covering the death of the Pope, the Immobiliare, etc. Freeze the picture, and look at the newspaper text under the headlines. You'll see news copy referring to the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, and even some text from a word processing manual! Time must have run out in the editing room. Coppola's great, his attention to small details....he's not Stanley Kubrick.Recommended (before any other DVD I can think of).	5.0	Entertaining for an entire week (or more) of viewing	2003-09-28	1	1	0
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1RSEFKQZXCXSY	Ed D. Whitaker	First of all I am a HUGE Godfather fan and I know almost everything there is to know about the first two films. When I heard Godfather was to be released to DVD over a year ago but was going to be delayed due to the fact the studio and (Coppola?) were going to give it the red carpet treatment, I was happy that finally, every scrap of footage that was ever cut was going to be replaced! From The Saga, (the tv version with the most added footage) to the Complete Epic which has scenes that neither the regular version or the Saga have. Plus I was hoping for even more footage. Warning people! The 3 films are all as you would have seen them at the movies! Although awesome DVD picture quality and sound, never the less this is NOT the To-End-All Godfather DVD I had waited and waited for:( All of the &quot;extra footage&quot; is on the 5th supplemental disc not cut in with the rest of the film as I had hoped for. And what makes it even worse, is that, the makers of this DVD didn't even put ALL of the extra scenes in, I know of 4 more scenes they didn't add to this disc. What a disappointment for a true die hard fan. Maybe one day they will put together a version to end all versions, until then I still Have my own version I painstakenly cut together from 3 different versions over the course of 2 weeks, although the quailty and sound are not the greatest, I feel I do have the most complete version.	2.0	Lots of Holes in this Godfather	2001-10-11	48	19	29

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A28UFJF5K9DESN	"Elle ""Film Fan"""	Regrettably I had to return this item.  In Godfather II there was a lip sync problem.  The scene with the young Vito, and his friends speaking Italian a few beats before you hear the sound.  Maybe some people have missed it because they are reading the subtitles but it was very noticeable to me. I would have requested an exchange but was only given the option of a refund.I will buy another set, and hopefully it won't have this problem.  While watching I was reminded of Singing in the Rain, when the leads on screen began talking out of sinc and eventually swapping lines, 'yes, yes, yes.'  'No, no, no.'Picture quality is excellent.	3.0	Yes Yes Yes..No No No...	2011-07-25	3	0	3

I almost never write Amazon reviews, but I have to warn anyone who might be considering purchasing this particular blu-ray set: The transfer is the worst I've ever seen. It's almost like watching a VHS tape recorded to a blu-ray disc. If all you care about is seeing a masterpiece, whatever the quality, then this is the set for you. If you want a masterpiece in blu-ray quality, then avoid this set. You'll be very disappointed -- as I was. It was hard to watch the first movie: Every 10 minutes or so I felt compelled to announce that &#34;this transfer SUCKS&#34;, to the occasional annoyance of and occasional hearty agreement from my companions.

The second and escpecially the third are deccent but nothing to write home about, the packing is awful and each time the discs are watched and returned to the cases they get scratched. why make a box set like this the rocky and superman boxes were packaged better then this although they had very few features expect on the first movies.The only thing good abot the set is the fifth disc of bonus materails they are nice and enjoyable, bottom line don't buy this they will issue a new and better version very soon am sure just like thier doing for almost famous in decemember.	2.0	5 for the movie one for box set thje worst one i own	2001-11-02	12	7	5

This movie always ends up in the top 10 of an all time list.  The 2nd and 3rd installment are good too, with the 3rd the weakest of the 3.  This Blu-Ray version is fantastic video and audio quality.  Now some may feal the first film is ""grainy"" and this is actualy by design.  Coppola wanted this grity, grainy feal to the movie so dont' think the blu-ray is defective.  It is still, by far, the sharpest and cleanest version you will ever see.  This is not like the TV version Coppola cut before, it is the original theatrical version with full cut.  If you have not seen this before, it is a must own.Don't be fooled by the grain, I own the SD-DVD version and this one is much cleaner in many scenes.  However, some scenes are in fact very similar.  This probably has to do with the quality of the original film used to convert.  That said, I seriously doubt that there will EVER be a cleaner version of this movie then the Blu-RayThe audio is also fantastic.Again, this is a must own for any movie buff.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A23C466WIP8XJE	Erin	......before forking over a pretty large amount of cash (not refundable after opening the package) or like me, you will be sorely disappointed, when you discover that the Bonus Track, promising several hours of additional footage, does not play on your (possibly older model) but also NEWER DVD Player (mine is a Pioneer Elite). I thought that at first I had a defective disc, and was, after much suspicion and hassle (the stores are very fearful of bootlegging) able to exchange only the bonus disk; took it home and same problem. Then discovered, after returning to the store where I bought the DVD Player, that the Godfather DVD Collection was not made to play on &quot;all&quot; older or newer DVD Players (it's very selective). That is when the disclaimer, in very tiny print on the back of the disk, was discovered. In writing this, I'm hopeful that anyone considering buying this expensive set (worth the money, perhaps, IF IT ACTUALLY PLAYED, and minus Godfather 111, in my humble opinion, but that's another story) will be spared unnecessary and unwarranted time, money and huge amount of hassle by checking whether their OLDER or NEWER model DVD Player is compatible with this disk BEFORE BUYING IT. Paramount doesn't appear to care. They and anyone connected to the release of this disk ought to be ashamed of misleading consumers, and correct the situation immediately.	1.0	Check The Paramount Disclaimer (In Very Small Print)........	2001-11-13	116	80	36

Unfortunately, the DVD set was re-released as the ""Coppola Restoration"" and I could not go out and find the original DVD set released in 2001 (which by now is far cheaper than the new set). Purchasing the new gift set, I went home and with great anticipation opened the box set and admired the new packaging and montage of photos from all three films aligning the front cover to the back in a blood-splattered animation. Included was new slim DVD cases for each individual film, and brand spanking new special features along with the previous special features from the first gift set encompassing 2 discs. Part II which originally was spanning 2 discs on the fist set is now compressed to 1 disc, which I find rather nice than having to switch discs in between the movie. However, the picture quality is sub-standard. Too grainy!!!! It looks like Coppola copied the films from the VHS versions of the movies and tried to sell it off as a restoration. I don't see any real problem with the tangerine colorization other reviewers are complaining about, but I do notice that some whites do get blurry when shown. But it does nothing really to effect the eyes. I'm keeping the Restoration as my copy of the films since I currently don't own a Blu-Ray player. I'd recommended this version of the trilogy for those who have Blu-Ray and recommend the first gift set for those who own DVD (I'm sure that some stores still carry it or you can buy it online, maybe from Amazon :-P).

The transformation of Al Pacino's character, Michael Corleone is possibly the greatest achievement in motion picture history. He starts off as a innocent young American and eventually becomes the head of the most powerful crime organization in his country. Looking back, it was a dream cast with Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Dinero, Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A29QA79VLQGHY6	Flipper Campbell	Francis Ford Coppola's &quot;Godfather&quot; films continue to be treated with the respect due the dons of American gangster movies, with Paramount going all out on a state-of-the-art five-disc set that marks the trilogy's debut on DVD. Whatever ambivalence the studio has exhibited over the years toward Coppola's three films has clearly faded. The box set is beautifully presented, with care and class evident at every turn. The creative decisions reportedly were made almost exclusively by Coppola and his Zoetrope Prods. Coppola's love -- and obsession -- are evident throughout. &quot;The Godfather DVD Collection&quot; clocks in at a massive 745 minutes. Coppola provides new director's commentary on all three films, adding to the already significant body of knowledge and lore attached to them. His comments are focused and instructive, with pauses that let the films' content amplify his points. Coppola's commentary strips away a good bit of the first film's mystique. Shot on a tight budget, the production was &quot;pretty flimsy,&quot; he says. Doubles are used extensively to speed shooting. Extras blunder their way into shots. A key actor can't handle his lines while facing the great Brando. Even the great wedding scene was rushed and fudged. Slight of hand is everywhere. It was all &quot;very sloppy,&quot; Coppola admits. The set's extra features run from the sublime -- Marlon Brando's screen test; an alternative opening to &quot;Godfather III&quot; -- to the absurd -- Coppola actually spends screen time detailing the quality of the grommets that bind his shooting notes together. Cinematographer Gordon Willis' yellows and tannic browns of &quot;The Godfather&quot; are rendered beautifully, while the coal-mine blacks of &quot;Godfather II&quot; provide a dramatic contrast to its subdued flesh tones. Both films have minor speckling throughout, due to age and the limitations of 1970s film stock. The more contemporary &quot;Godfather III&quot; (1990) is pristine, however. All three films offer a bit more picture information than previous video releases, including the ambitious laser set of 1997. Detail is greatly enhanced despite the heavy shadows and high contrast. Taken as a whole, these sure-handed transfers deliver a highly artistic presentation.	5.0	Coppola's revenge	2001-10-24	0	0	0

This set provides us with the 3 movies and in depth background DVD.In Summary:DISC 1 - Godfather I (Oscar/Best Picture 1970) introduces us to Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando - Oscar/Best Actor) the &quot;GODFATHER&quot; his family and his family right after WW II.  Rival Family takeover fails  to assassinate Vito, but murder his oldest son. This causes the unsuspecting rise to power of the youngest son Michael to run and eventually become the Godfather (when Vito semi retires). (Extra - candid commentary by Coppola)DISC 2 &amp; 3 - Godfather II (Oscar/Best Picture 1972 &amp; Best Director - Coppola) and the continuing rise of power of the Corleone family led by Michael (Pacino) trying to legitimize the family business with flashbacks of a young Vito (Robert DeNiro - Oscar/Best Supporting Actor) in his rise to power.  A parallel story of 2 generations and their similarities in accomplishing the seige of power. (Extra - Coppola commentary)DISC 4 - Godfather III (1990) Has Michael trying to become respectable and leave his past behind.  Through this process his past proves to be his down fall and major obstruction to his dream of leaving the underworld. (Extra - Coppola commnetary)DISC 5 - This DVD has many excellent features including a look at Coppolas real family connection to the series - sister ( playing Vitos daughter in all movies -Talia Shire), daughter (Sofia in Godfather III) &amp; father (winning OSCAR/Best Score -Godfather II). The CORLEONE FAMILY TREE (sorts out the characters and their relationships to each other), GODFATHER TIME LINE (you can pinpoint the actual events of the Godfather movies and characters), many deleted scenes which really fills in the details of this complex saga.  Most delightful is the early screen tests and how Coppola and the stars became friends etc.This DVD set is the most complete allowing us to really understand Mario Puzo's and Francis Ford Coppola's mind set and the world of the &quot;GODFATHER&quot;.	5.0	AFI voted Godfather I &amp; II into top 100 films !!  and Why ?	2001-10-16	26	21	5
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3L87WM73GRVJ7	"Foxx ""fox"""	"The Godfather: What can I say that has not already have been said. This movie is a classic mafia/gangster masterpiece. I was very impressed by everyone's performances, in particular: Brando and Pacino. I loved everything about this movie, especially the second half of the movie...I was at the edge of my seat on what was going to happen next. My favorite scene: Michael surrounded by Rocco, Al Neri, and Clemenza with Clemenza taking Michael's hand...kissing it and then saying...""Don Corleone"". Truly memorable. I rate it 10/10 stars.The Godfather Part II: My personal favorite of all three films. The thing I found most fascinating about this film was the character of Michael Corleone. How very different from the one in the original. I actually found him to be the most dangerous character not only in Pacino's Mafia/gangster characters, but in all gangster movies I had ever seen with all respect to: Carlito's Way, Casino, Scarface, and Goodfellas. I say this because he never has to raise a hand or a finger to commit such destruction to his enemies. A simple command from his voice, and his enemies shall suffer. Pacino took it to the max in this film.Also the comparisons between father and son were excellent. I noticed how they differed between each other. With Vito being a loved and respected Don. While Michael being more feared and dangerous. Notice how much more powerful he is than his father in this one. Truly Coppola at his best. My favorite scene, the kiss of death. 10/10 stars. I WOULD GIVE IT 11 IF I COULD. Outstanding film.The Godfather Part III: I enjoyed this final installment to the godfather series very much. I loved how they brought back many characters from the original film such as: Don Tommasino, Johnny Fontane, Lucy Mancini, Callo, Enzo the baker, etc....good move. Is it just me, or is Al Neri one dangerous and loyal man to Michael or what. I liked that they had him in there by Mike's side again, very trustworthy. I miss Tom Hagan very much in this one, but George is one good lawyer from what I saw. Vincent, although very tempered like his father, I liked how Michael talked to him in the hospital, telling him to how he always felt responsible for him and how he did'nt want him to end up the way his father did. His attitude in the second half of this film was much more mature and presentable. Sofia as Mary was not an outstanding performance, nor was it a bad one at all...it was a pleasent one. I did not find it bad compared to what others think. My favorite scene, Michael lets out a horrible scream while laying by his murdered daughter, which to me represents all of Michael's past tyrant acts of killings and murders and horrible choices he made, the ordered killing of his brother, etc. Very good scene!!! 8/10 stars. Good movie to end the godfather story.Best trilogy I've ever seen!!!"	5.0	Al Pacino, you have my complete respect!	2004-10-22	10	10	0

This is about the blu-ray transfer. There are people who did not like it, and this for two reasons: 1) It does not look better than the DVD. This is simply not true. I have played both Coppola restorations in the same player and TV, and the difference between the upgraded DVD and the Blu-Ray is huge. The quality of the image in Blu-Ray is just mind-blowing (at least in this US edition). 2) It is grainy. This one is true, and yet, I have seen more grain in very recent movies. And, after all, it is the original grain of the celluloid, not some DNR artifact, so it is actually cinematographically great to see it; it is the way the director and photographer intended it to look. If you want pristine grainless clarity, forget about this one (and yet, it is not that grainy...I was surprised to see so little of it after having read some grain-haters reviews), but if you want to watch it as good as, or proably better, than in cinemas, this is it.	5.0	About this blu-ray transfer.	2009-08-13	9	8	1

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2HA256ESHNT3M	"Fran from Flemington ""willdude"""	After having watched the first film, I have to say that it is the best drama I have ever seen.  It is structured like a long epic, chronicling the important events to the Corleones:  the fall and rise of Vito and the family, Michael's integration into the business, and his eventual take over and relocation of the family.  With all this, it still manages to have a very subjective feel to it, keeping very close to the characters, specifically Michael and the Don, throughout the entire movie.  What may be decieving is that the last hour of the movie, as opposed to the first 2, takes place over a much more extended period of time.  It's &quot;strictly business&quot; and may be offsetting to some, but it has such powerful scenes, such as the Vito and Michael talking, Michael confronting Carlo, and the entire end sequence, that you can't dislike it.  And looking back on the entire movie, and trilogy, you come to realize that the Godfather is really a saga of a family and its business over a period of many years whose last hour is a fantastic lead up to the ending, and, ultimately, Part II.	5.0	Greatest Drama Ever	2001-10-14	0	0	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2C7BOQVFH1HLE	Frederick Baptist	"This trio of movies represent the best trilogy ever made and I'd include the Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones (to keep its honour intact I'm going to ignore the last outing) and any other trilogy that's currently out there.  The trilogy is a classic in describing the descent into corruption of innocence and how slippery a slope it is.  It starts out as a way to defend the family and then spirals out of control so that excuses are constantly made up less and less compelling than before to justify the continued involvement in it until after all the destroyed lives years later comes the realisation that the deception is complete.  This whole set is simply a masterpiece in story-telling and Francis Ford Coppola is the master of the genre.The movies come well packaged in 4 digipak holders that fit into a neat slipcase the fourth disc containing bonus materials the pick of which is a behind the scenes documentary.  The sound quality is average coming with surround sound options although the picture quality isn't perfect which is understandable given the age of the masters but it improves gradually as you get to the second and third movies.  That said the imperfections are plentiful coming in the form of black, white spots and in some scenes white slashes and while not so bad as to detract too much from the viewing experience but they do become obvious enough to comment about and so overall this is an average quality standard dvd format version of the movies.  It'll be interesting to see how much better the Blu-ray version is and whether or not they managed to clean up the picture quality even more; I'll have an update on that once I receive it and have a chance to view it hopefully within the next month or so.Movie-making of the highest order!Highly recommended!Updated 31 Jan 2012:As Amazon will not allow me to review the blu ray version of this separately, I've decided to append this here.  The Blu Ray release is a disappointment because the picture quality is only slightly improved over the dvd version with still lots of grain in too many frames and either the master film has deteriorated so badly that this is the best that they could do or the restoration work was pretty poorly done.  Having watched lots of 1080p discs and even standard dvds that have been upscaled that look lots better than any of the 3 films here it's safe to say that I'll wait for a much, much better restoration job to be done hopefully in the near future.  All-time classic films like the first two films here deserve a whole lot better than this blu ray alleged ""restoration"".  Till then, I recommend you wait for a much better picture and even sound quality release i.e. at least DTS HD MA 5.1 instead of this average Dolby 5.1 version."	3.0	The Best Ever Trilogy but an Average DVD Transfer!

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3M5O6UHXO9IBU	Gary	The Godfather: Brando hams it up. Talia Shire cannot cut it. Some of the commentary is useful. For instance, the scene where Micheal proposes to Kay after returning from Sicily made Coppola uncomfortable because he felt that Micheal's hat made him look like a Rabbi. I never could put my finger on what bothered me about that scene but he's absolutely right.Part II: Coppola re-wrote the script over a weekend to keep Pacino onboard and it shows. Every scene reeks of redundancy. The first film told the story adequately, thus making this interminable sequel a pointless exercise in venality, especially ironic as 'The Godfather' was a critique of big business. Talia's performance improves slightly. Poor Diane Keaton is the recipient of Coppola's slide into corny dialogue: &quot;Our marriage is the abortion! All this must end!&quot;Part III: Mama-mea! A franchise? Get out the Don dolls! Talia becomes the black widow and comes into her own, spitting venom. Poor Dianne: &quot;You are my horror, Micheal!&quot; This is post-comeback Pacino and he slouches around trying to be lovable. Bridget Fonda gives me the horn, though.  A silly film.I revisited 'The Godfather' purely for the acting. As a series it is largely a dreary and masochistic experience. Despite complaints, the DVD picture quality seems okay to me.	3.0	*That quote here* ZZZZZZZZZZZ	2002-05-27	8	3	5
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2KZVJR0FILOGK	Gary Maloney	This set actually contains six videos, not five -- the sixth is a documentary made in 1990 containing several outtakes and behind-the-scenes footage from the three films (but especially I and III).  These outtakes  include the famous &quot;screen test&quot; for Brando (actually, a makeup  test), and the equally fascinating test by Robert DeNiro for the role of  Sonny.  The best, however, is the weaving of the three films into one  coherent and chronological whole.  Only one flashback is retained -- the  return of Vito (DeNiro) to Corleone to kill Don Ciccio.  But most  important, more than a half-hour of CRUCIAL footage is restored, especially  to Parts I and II.  They include several parts of James Caan's performance  as Sonny; a brilliant scene with the dying Consigliere, Genco Abbandando;  and two scenes from the early 1900s with the young Clemenza (Bruno Kirby).  The only thing possibly missing here -- widescreen presentation.  But the  quality of the missing footage, plus the extra sixth video, more than make  up for any deficiencies.	5.0	Most complete version of Godfather saga; great extra footage	1999-01-01	21	20	1
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2NEF39XOQ4A15	Gautam Rau	The Godfather has ensnared generations of moviegoers with its indefinable and spellbinding mystique. Every decade a new generation wonders what all the hullabaloo is about, as it hears tales from its preceding one told with the awe reserved for having witnessed a real-life experience, and seeks to explore, simply out of curiosity. And emerges from that 3-hour experience with the same wistful look in its eye. Of having felt - &quot;This is a different world I've entered, cut-off from the one I left outside the theatre. It works according to its own laws. I'm not sure I want to leave, but I'll always carry it with me.&quot; And thus, we go back, again, and again, and again, to see this film supposedly about mafias and gangs and their rulers and their mighty tiffs. We are ready to see men being strangulated in the back seat of cars, bullets battering a body on a lone highway, a girl being blown up, a blood-stained bath-tub, and the beheaded horse, if only we could get to see one more torturous time, Michael sitting alone on a bench, when all is over in Part 2, staring into the distance. And then to see the credits roll, and hear Nino Rota's mournful score, one more time. Yes this is a world of sordid crime, but to us it is a haven of respite. Yes its protagonist is the warlord of the underworld, but we find his story more bewitching than that of many heroes. Yes do speak softly love, for this is a timeless romance.What is it about the Godfather that reduces, critics and viewers alike, to mawkish rhapsodies? I think we owe this experience to the staggering technical achievements of this film. We see the Godfather as visual, sonic, dramatic, and musical poetry; it is poetry that is painstakingly crafted.Every time one sees the movie one discovers new things, a hallmark of a great work. One of the most interesting things is the sound. Not the music; the sound of feet, the screeching wheels and car engines, children playing in the background, the clap of thunder, the jazz playing on the streets, the dialing of a phone, an eagle cawing, the slow measured voices, and also the silences; the sound editing is perfectly executed and significantly heightens the tension of the movie. This is a movie that one could hear, not see, and yet be enthralled.Coppola makes great use of contrasting sounds and images at the same time. For instance, ominous dialogues are set against backdrop of chatter of children playing and playful jazz music. After Hagen is kidnapped by Solozzo there is a cynical shot of a Santa Claus in a shop window.There are many subtle symbolisms. There is the scene where when Michael learns that his father has been shot he is agitated and calling home from a public booth. In the background Kay is standing outside the booth, with the glass separating them looking anxiously at him. It is a sign of the rift that will now develop between them.A notable feature is the transition of one scene to another. After the shot showing the cut off head of Woltz's horse the picture dissolves into a shot of the Godfather, his face impassive, his chin determined. After the bridal scene of Michael and Apollonia, the shot changes to Kay entering the Corleone house. Such transitions speak volumes.Coppola takes time with his scenes. The scene with Michael and Solozzo in the restaurant is an example. It's builds up very slowly. At one point the camera waits for the waiter to cork open a bottle of wine while Solozzo and Michael eye each other, one with suspicion, and the other with suppressed hostility. Coppola very painstakingly builds the ambience of each scene with his measured progression, so that we are completely drawn into this haunting world. Whether it's the Don holding court, the Woltz mansion, a street, a hospital, a restaurant, Sicily, a graveyard or a church, all the time we are there, in the scene, living it all the way. Though this is a thoroughly romanticized depiction of the gangster world, it all seems real. The director slowly engrosses the viewer into the scene and builds it up to a climax. This approach is carried scene by scene. Each scene ends with a mini-climax and the movie progresses climax by climax to its thundering and numbing end.The last segment of Part 1 - the baptism, the end of Carlo Rizzi, and the confrontation between Kay and Michael - is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece.There is nothing superfluous in the film, each little detail builds the picture into a whole, heightening the drama, increasing our understanding of characters and adding additional strokes to the large and sprawling canvas on which it is depicted.Today, three generations on, the Godfather films remain, in addition to being shattering celluloid masterpieces, an educating experience in the art of film-making to movie artisans and a lesson to audiences in the discerning skill of film appreciation.	5.0	The Great Hollywood Tragedy	2003-10-09	0	0	0

The DVD package for the most part is a gem.The Movies, Godfather I &amp; II need no review, and III is good enough along side the other two.Disk five is full of information and Easter eggs that really should be boring, and yet are done in such a way that even the most trivial piece of information is made interesting and exciting. There's enough there to please and educate any Godfather fan, maybe just leaving you wanting a little bit more.I was disappointed that the deleted scenes weren't incorporated into the full features, but they were at least included, and exciting to see.The big letdown for me was the feature I most eagerly anticipated - Francis Ford Copolla's commentary on top of each movie. I was exasperated by the second hour of the first movie, having heard for the umpteenth time how close he was to being fired, and why, and when, and by who, and on what day and for what reason - did I already say that?Incredible classic scenes are being played, and instead of talking about the scenes, the difficulties, the stories, the actors, the FILM... it was all about him, his low budget and how often he was almost fired. By the third hour I was groaning.Besides this wasted opportunity to really experience scene by scene how this movie was made, I'm glad this DVD came out. It's a welcome addition to my collection of classics.	4.0	Almost a gem	2001-12-30	0	0	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AIHHBCXKCPC5U	G. E. McNeal	To Start the Movies are awesome for sure. But I had the Collection on tape already, and the quality is no diferent, they just threw the same picture on the DVDS with the one bonus disk with the extra footage, which is the only reason I gave it a 2. So basically I paid 80 dollars for the extra bonus footage. Almost all the other commentaries were on the tapes as well. The first DVD is all pixilated on an HD TV, and the sound quality is terrible as well. Pretty much the same for them all though. I am very disappointed in Paramount for this rerelease to DVD. They need to take a look at how Lucas remastered the StarWars, Which in My opinion is no where near as good as a movie as the Godfathers. Maybe in another 10 years, or when they want to make more money off of the trilogy, they will digitally remaster, and sell a special edition godfather trilogy set and make another 80 dollars off of everyone. Sad part is, I will buy it too.	2.0	IT'S NOT DIGITALY REMASTERED	2004-12-21	15	13	2

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2BKGN190HKZG1	"""gerd-mari"""	This is a movie you had to see if you are interested of mafia movies. It`s the best ever made.Probably the two best known trilogies in the history are the &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy and &quot;The Godfather&quot; trilogy. To look at all three films by Francis Ford Coppola is to look at three examples of films when it is best,of great acting and composition. The first &quot;Godfather&quot; is a true masterpiece, full of so many characters and such a moving story. Marlon Brando is marvellous in probably his best role ever. Marlon Is just what I how I imagien a godfather looks like. It's also a great parable on the son taking over for the father, of a bloody family tradition being passed down the generations.And the funny thing is, even the son who didn't want anything to do with the family business, Michael Corleone, is eventually the one who ends up commanding it. &quot;The Godfather Part 2&quot; is a brilliant look at both the father and son at the same age.In Godfather Part III may not be an equal to the first two, but it undeniably completes the story of Michael Corleone, and it does so splendidly. It's about Michael who will make legall buisness, and find a new Godfather Vincent(Andy Garcia). This saga is a must for anyone who loves movies. Other mafia movies who I recommend is Casino, Goodfellas and the serie Sopranos are my favorits.	5.0	The best mafia movie ever	2001-05-29	2	2	0
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1JVSIWDF0WT22	GeValero	"After my yearly view of these films and 6 months after buying the re-release James Bond collection it has become obvious to me that it can't be too long before a new edition of these movies comes out. The picture on all 3 Godfather movies (in this release) is so full of specks and the sound so limited, it's hard to believe Paramount won't do something about them soon. The new Bond release shows the technology is there for something so much better.About the movies themeselves, every time I watch #I, I always come up saying that has to be the best movie of all time. I don't care all that much about the Miami section of #II but when the last hour of that film comes up and Michael tells Fredo ""he's not a brother, he's not a friend"" and then ""forgives him"" at the funeral (while giving Neri the not so forgiving look) well, I'm just not so sure which ones is the best.#III is obviously not in the same league as the other II. It has plenty of sublime moments but:a) If not Winona Ryder, why did it have to be Sofia ? Why couldn't Coppola face the truth while watching the dailies ?b) Why cut Tom Hagen, my single favorite character of the first 2 movies ?c) Who can buy Michael's son going from law student to established opera singer in about 2 weeks ?Andy Garcia may be best thing in this movie but as good an actor as he is he can't possibly convince you it hurts him to dump his cousin or, for that matter, dump Bridget Fonda for his cousin.Still, the opera ending is phenomenal and Sofia's death scene incredibly powerful (thanks to Pacino, obviously). Michael Corleone's confession as well as his death scene are two of my favorite moments of the series so I can not consider #III a total waste.Motion picture history as a whole wouldn't be the same without the Corleones and forgive me for not including any ""offer that can not be refused"" in this review."	5.0	THE CREAM DE LA CREME OF MOTION PICTURES	2007-07-21	2	1	1
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3LH77PBDFEO3F	"G. E. Williams ""Nunah"""	"In July, I watched the Godfather trilogy in one sitting, which is the way I would suggest to anyone that wants to see this great film, as a very long 8 hour movie. What did I like so much about it? For me and I may just be weird in this, the story is about the modern business model, and what can go wrong. It is also about how a mostly good man can make by ever so small of a gesture towards the evil choice can be eventually sucked into being what he swore he would not. And finally it is a warning about how one can lose what is most important simply by trying to protect them. Want to know how I got there?One reoccurring theme that is highlighted in this saga, is explained very well in a book by Business Ethicist Quinn G. McKay Bottom Line On Integrity, The in which he discusses the Law of Obligation. Which means (and here's the short version) when you accept a favor or gift, you still in fact enter into a social contract ""I gave, you accepted, so you owe."" In the Godfather, Don Vito is always performing a ""service"" for someone that will be repaid at some future date with a service that will be named later. As baby boomers we grew up with ""I'm sorry I can't accept that, but thank you"" as our parents taught us this law. This applies to favors as well as material things. It's not that we shouldn't accept gifts or favors; they are part of the social compact that hold societies, but businesses and institutions often have rules about what kind of gifts are allowed to be accepted by employee, and still we see time after time scandals involving politicians and CEO's or prison guards; what have you. Employers should also realize that to an extent, the same goes for a hired service, if you pay an employee less respect or compensation than is prudent for what he provides as a service for you, you have in effect broken you social contract with that employee.Which brings me to my next point, if an employer treats an employee with disrespect, he has violated the ""No A******e Rule"" Brilliantly illustrated in the book by the same name by Robert I. Sutton. Don Michael finds this to be the case with both his brother Alfredo, and his sister Connie's husband , and when you violate the rule... You must be prepared to pay the A*****e Tax. In the case of this saga, the tax is paid with betrayal. In real life, betrayal can come in many forms.Another concept illustrated in the saga is the concept of the ""Tipping Point"" the study in another great book by Malcolm Gladwell, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference . That investigates how trends change. For business, it is a valuable thing to understand. In the Godfather Saga, the Corleone Dons both understood, this concept, seeing what certain business changes would do to the neighborhood, family, and business, but at the same time not seeing what the consequence would be in bucking the business trend.Finally, it ask the question ""is it worth it""? A popular American maxim in the 60's was ""No other success can compensate for failure in the home"". In the end of the saga, Don Michael tells his ex-wife, I never wanted this Business, I only wanted to protect my family, and in the end I lost them anyway"". I often am troubled by the hours I am away from my family, trying to ""protect them"", to provide for them etc. and I often wonder, what we could do without, if I could spend more time at home, would we in the end be better off? I heard a talk last year where the speaker said when a man is on his death bed, he never wishes he could have worked more over-time"" ."	5.0	Advanced course in business	2008-08-24	2	2	0

Any type of movie I generally enjoy. (Of course modern hollywood get's a little tedious).Anyway I had heard so mucha bout the Godfather (As had anyone else) that when I finally got a hold of the first one I couldn't wait to jam it in.Now I've seen Apocolypse Now and quite frankly I think it's amazing. Despite the fact that I feel the end is something to be desired, I still love the movie and can see why Copella is so highly acclaimed.But let's face it people, the Godfather is tedious and boring.Now for all I know I will watch it again, change my mind and forever regret writing this, but not yet.I thought it was too long and slow, Al Pacino was highly over-rated as always (Don't get me wrong I still like him) and the film didn't really go anywhere.The only reason that I can imagine people falling to there knees over it, is that it's a film about the mafia. Since it was on eof the first that really took the whole thing seriously people enjoyed it because they thought that what they were watching was real.I don't know.I asked someone recently why they thought it was the best film ever made and he couldn't say. It looked to me like he was repeating his fathers words, as I'm sure so many others are.Basically, I don't want to put you off it, I f you like it, and you know you like it then by all means buy it. But you have to admit it's over rated.The best film ever made? Come on people, Reservoir Dogs strangles this film and Pulp Fiction kills it.It's boring and you know it. But if you can sit through nice cinematography for hours on end, time after time without anything happening, then feel free.P.SKeep posted for when I see it again.

The first time I saw the Blue Ray edition of Godfather was when AMC (I think) showed it on cable when the Blue Ray came out. I remember watching it and thinking, ""Wow, is this the same movie?"" This reaction was even though I have a HD tv but don't subscribe to HD content. Even then I could see the difference.The Blue Ray Coppola Restoration is a wonderful visual feast, and much better audio quality. The restoration is so much clearer, it's almost like seeing the movies for the first time. The audio on The Godfather was good, but the audio punch of machine gun fire into Michael's bedroom near the start of the second movie, actually caused me to turn it down but then turn the volume up a bit and kept at that volume. The audio is MUCH better than previous movies I've seen on cable.If you like or love these movies, you will not be disappointed if you have the player and TV to accomodate Blue Ray."	5.0	As Good As Advertised	2013-02-01	2	1	1

I tried to watch it all the way through, but fell asleep after about 6 hours.The Godfather part II is even longer, somewhere between 15 and 20 hours, which according to Godfather fans makes it better than the first.The Godfather part III is so boring and awful that even fans of the first two movies can't stand it.And keep in mind, I was able to sit through all 4 or 5 hours of Citizen Kane and I actually kind of liked it, so my taste in movies is not the problem here.	1.0	Worst movies ever	2009-11-19	27	1	26
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3RBVL167FXSOV	Gregory L Dyas	Anyone remotely familiar with film knows & loves The Godfather, truly our American epic.  And having pored through the DVD I can truly say that I feel this is the definitive version of this masterpiece.  OK, as everyone's said here before, #3 stinks, whatever, we know, shaddup.  That isn't the point.  The point is a beautiful widescreen digital picture.  The point is 5.1 digital surround sound.  Those two greatest benefits of the DVD format have allowed me to watch this picture at home in a way I've only been able to approach previously when our local art house deigns to show them on the big screen.  As one would expect, the DVD menus & formatting is very professionally done.  The extras are also stunning, including the Coppola commentaries for all 3 films, a great timeline & geneology of the Corleone family, scenes from the 1977 re-edited version, etc.  I found the documentary & shorts less interesting, but your mileage may vary.  In the end though, if you've always loved these movies but never owned them, this is the way to watch them.  If you've got them on VHS widescreen version & don't have home theater I'd say keep what you have.  If you buy, you're sure not to be disappointed, though a movie with this sort of grandeur really does call for a home theater situation.As far as people being [angry] about not getting that re-edited 1977 version on DVD, I have two things to say.  First, I'm sure it'll hit stores eventually so stop yer whining, and second, for what it's worth I think they're best apart.  The first introduces us to this warped vision of Americana and our primary character, Michael, while the second shows us both the genesis of Vito's legacy and the beautiful parallels between the decisions and actions of the young Vito & Michael as the new Godfather that're lost when they're melded into a linear tale.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2U0WL1D6SRTO3	Gregory Saffady	THE GODFATHER is without question the greatest American film of all time.  THE GODFATHER trilogy is without comparrison, although GODFATHER PART III, gets 5 stars only by default.  The most interesting of the three films remains GODFATHER PART II, boasting the best ending of any American film ever (Bogart walking off into the fog in CASABLANCA notwithstanding).  The reason:  Same as GF I, the characters.  GF II's most interesting being Frank Pantangeli (Michael V. Gazzo, in an Oscar nominated performance)the old school cosa nostra caught in a world of hurt by changing times.  There's no respect for the old ways (the families negotiating instead of going to war)or traditions (Italian musicians who can't play the tarantela, WASP-ish food at a Corleone event).  This charactrer is fascinating, eclipsing Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg also nominated for Best Supporting Actor)and all of the Corleone clan, including Robert DeNiro's Oscar winning performance as Young Vito Corleone...asking the filmdom question:  Was it the performance or the role itself that was Oscar caliber, considering Brando won for his iconistic work in GF (1972). What would have been perfect, in addition to this set, was FFC cutting all three films, with the deleted scenes, just as he did in THE GODFATHER, THE COMPLETE NOVEL FOR TV, and in the 1990 VHS package.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A32O5FZH994CNY	"G. Ware Cornell Jr. ""anotherlawyer"""	"When I was in college I went to the theatre and watched Francis Ford Coppola's brilliant interpretation of Mario Puzo's bestsellerThe Godfather. The stunning photography and sound transformed a very good Mafia story into an iconic piece of American culture. Over the years I have watched the Godfather and its brilliant sequel in various formats, film, VHS and DVD. But finally when the trilogy was restored by Coppola and his incredible cinematographer Gordon Willis I broke one of my cardinal rules about acquiring Blu-ray versions of movies I already own in DVD.I watched on myMitsubishi LT-46149 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV with Integrated Sound Projector, which fully optimizes Blu-ray disks in a 1080p format. Just to be sure I compared it with the original triologyThe Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III)on the same set using aSony BDP-S301 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player BD/DVD/CD Playback with Bonus HDMI Cablewhich ""upverts"" standard DVDto 1080i.There is no comparison.The colors are deep and rich in Blu-ray, while they are faded and scratchy on the ""upverted"" DVD. The overall effect of the restoration is to bring that original movie onto that original theatre screen into my house. Even though Godfathers I and II have never lost their place in the pantheon of American film, we have for years been watching these films under less than ideal conditions. The darkness that surrounds Don Corleone and then Michael became more dark gray than near-black. In its 1080p restoration the vermillion Statute of Liberty rises from the flat marsh grasses looking more like amber waves of grain than a neutral killing field. Taillights twinkle against the buffed exteriors of post-war automobiles as Michael exits the restaurant after killing a rival don and a corrupt police captain.In Godfather II the 1080p again recreates the feel of the original cinema release, subject to a few clearly enhanced scenes. In several of the lake scenes (excluding Fredo's last bite) the water seems bluer and the mountains purpler. As many Godfather aficionados know the lake house was actually on the California side of  Lake Tahoe. From the back yard the mountain profile Heavenly is unmistakable, establishing the California address.The prequel segments featuring De Nero are bathed in sepia-like golden hues presumably as an antique finish that seems more reminiscent of Traffic than the theatrical rversion of Godfather II. It might be easy to say that the ""restoration"" has in some places done more than recast a damaged negative. However like the Star Wars recuts that used contemporary special effects technologies to create new virtual sets unimaginable in the 1970's, this restoration was the product of the original director in collaboration with the original cinematographer. These artists (and only they) are entitled to enhance their work using tools that help explain their original vision. this is not the colorized version of The Maltese Falcon whose pastels reeked havoc on a film noir classic. There is no reason these two films should not be works in progress by their creators.The second issue relating to any enhancement is of course the viewer. It has been 36 years since the public has watched a fresh print of the Godfather. Since then we have seen it in less than optimal circumstances on over the air analog television, VHS, standard DVD and even Betamax. Each one of these formats substantially degrades the original film with poor resolution, pan and scan editing, and sloppy sound mixing. With so many exposures to these two classics under less than perfect conditions it is slightly presumptious to attempt to say what it looked like back then.A 1080p Blu-ray version is a close as any average consumer is ever going to come to having a a fresh print. The bonus is that unlike a fresh print the digital imagery and sound will not fade, scratch or be formatted for television. In 38 years when Francis and Gordon (and I) will be likely be gone from this world this vision will be as fresh as it was today and in 1972 and 1974.I have no comment on Godfather IIII, which is a poor cousin to the first two films. It is good to have, if only to show that money drives Hollywood and even great directors."	5.0	The Restored Classic in Your Living Room	2008-10-09	16	14	2

Maybe because I was born on the same year the 1st part of The Godfather came out :)After watching this collection, I can't but admire the acting job and the movies but hate this DVD collection! Why? For the following reasons:1. Each part comes on a DVD that has nothing on it but the movie itself. Just Scenes Selection, Play The Movie & Set Up.2. The God Father 2 comes on two DVDs!!! Can you imagine changing DVDs in the middle of watching the movie?!! The film was 200 minutes long. Why on earth it was put on two DVDs instead of one?!!3. The documentary (Bonus DVD) is worthless!!! For God's sake, how can they satisfy The Godfather fans with such non sense?!! This movie is a master piece in cinema history, how could they insult us all with such meaningless bonuses?!!I give 5 stars to The Godfather but zero stars for this DVD Collection.	4.0	Great movie but bad DVDs	2002-04-28	33	23	10

Underaged, I begged my parents to take me to what would have been my first experience with an R-rated movie.  I was told to wait a few years.  Being the precocious and good girl that I was, I waited until I was ""old enough"" to watch the movie; however, I did not wait to get my hands on the novel, Mario Puzo's greatest and most famous work to date.  Even at a tender young age, I loved the book.  My parents, of course, had no idea I was reading the book!  Finally saw Parts I & II following my high school graduation and have been a fan of both movies ever since.  Like most Hollywood classics, they never get old.That said, I was not at all thrilled with Part III.  But no matter as I am getting all 3 movies (and then some) for the Deal of the Day price of $25.00 (not to mention free shipping).

These movies speaking about the mafia are true classics and listen to all of the reviews here. You shouldn't rent it, you must buy it. Although it does cost a good amount of $, it will be watched over and over again.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	The main feature of the classics in cinema is the fact they have their own life,  transcending by far the well known boundaries of historical time to inscribe in what I might denominate a mythical sphere. Not only due its undeniable virtues as treasured movies, or for the fact Coppola `s clinical eye in what the cast concerned, or the sublime adaptation of a classic best seller, but the meaning significance of its special contour for generations to come or for us who were exceptional witnesses at the moment this movie was presented for first time in the screen. Godfather I is just behind of Citizen Kane and Casablanca in the ambitious list of the greatest films of all time.So, far beyond of all these well deserved epithets, this is without doubt the most important and pyramidal saga of any other film ever made. For many young people, these adjectives may sound old fashioned, but the immortal feature is one of its most important landmarks. This luxurious pack preserves for the memories of the future, the essential nucleus of how was filmed, and for new directors an authentic and perpetual lesson about what are the rules must prevail at the movement to make a successful movie.Is there any other reason for not acquiring ?	5.0	Godfather' s saga has signed its own name with golden letters in the history of cinema	2007-07-10	0	0	0

The third one has so many different opinions that it doesn't pay to go into it.  i am here to rate the set not the movies.Anyone getting this set will go for a couple of things: Quality of transfer to DVD and the bonus disc extras.The quality is superb.  I watched this set on some state of the art systems as well as some truly archaic systems and its quality is as good as your equipment.  Both audio and video transfer came off well.The extra disc is also awesome.  It is full of interviews, family trees, director commentary, deleted scenes, etc.  I wish it could have gone on and on but it had to end somewhere.  It gives you a more than fair portion for all of these categories.This is a set that movie collectors should own.  I am assuming people that want to buy this set have seen the movies already.  If not rent them first and decide if you like the movies themselves before buying the collection.	5.0	A requirement for any collection	2005-08-05	21	19	2

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3LFJ9AOZWL9WM	Hussain Abdul-Hussain	This all time best Francis Ford Coppola's movie has simply dazzled all its viewers and won their admiration. From Iraq's unseated dictator Saddam Hussain to the average American Joe, all have named this movie as their all time favorite.Produced in the 1970s about a story whose settings take place in post World War II New York, Coppola skillfully transformed Mario Puzo's The Godfather into a successful movie with Hollywood giant Maron Brando and America's favorite Al Paccino playing the roles of a mafia leader and his younger son who took over family business after the father became too old to handle the business and the elder son who was slated to take over was shot dead in one of the mafia settling scores activity.The success of the movie made its producers release parts II and III. However, the first one of this sequel remains the jewel of The Godfather crown.Vast literature has been written about the anthropological and sociological manifestations of this movie. Two main themes, however, have found their ways to the forefront. First, the movie captures the mood during 1970s America during which most communities where abandoning civil rights movements in favor of promoting retrieving their different community character and the Italian-American community was no exception. Second, the movie has been often compared to the rise and fall of dictatorships around the world especially in Syria where the life of its late dictator Hafez Assad looks almost identical to The Godfather. Assad was grooming his elder son, Bassel, was killed in a car accident. This forced Assad to groom his second son, Bashar, who was not into his family's business but was later forced to succeed his father. In both the Godfather and Syria, things eventually slip from the hands of the second generation and become more difficult for the successors to keep things as they were during the days of their fathers.The movie is a classic and is certainly a movie collector's item.	5.0	The all time best movie	2006-05-26	5	4	1
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A30AIWY0MK336G	H Y Seo	There is no other mobster movie. There is no superlative extreme enough. The mount everest of mobster movies. If you are looking for an example of how to perfectly tell a saga of a family working out it's struggles and issues, much like any other family with the exception of careers, morality, power, principalities, and high finance, than this is your feature. This is one of the very select sequels that improves upon the oringal in almost every way; performance from the actors, set up of characters by the writer, and just plain drama from the story. The main reason for this is probably the fact that the first two installments is the telling of one novel. Puzo and Coppola basically split the novel &quot;The Godfather&quot; and made two movies from it. One did an adequate job, but it took the second to illucidate the saga. Based loosely on real mob families in New York, the orignal &quot;Godfather&quot; caused a sensation when it was premiered over three decades ago. Time is the ultimate test for a story, novel, or movie. The &quot;Godfather&quot; epic has only imporved with time. With other lesser attempts to re-capture the magic that Coppola recorded; it only stands out even more. Part III is a tribute to that often attempted failure. Even he could not recapture the splender that was the first two features. Maybe time, maybe actors, or maybe just that the saga was complete with two parts; can explain how the third part comes up short, or maybe the fact that part III was about money and lacked the passion of the first two. Regardless, you can throw away the disc, or tape for part III and you would still have the best story ever told in cinema. It has everything and is everything one could ever want. American, Italian, whatever, the &quot;Godfather&quot; is about humans. It covers all ethnicities and cultures; just plug in your own. The theme of family and economics and politics, are all timeless.I recommend the DVD because the VHS tapes will wear out with as many times as you will view the movies.	5.0	The Paragon	2004-02-28	7	6	1

This trilogy has some of the best character development I've ever seen, as you see the metamorphosis of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). From a war hero that had nothing to do with the family business, to a cold-blooded Mob boss.The GodfatherThe plot is kind of hard to explain here, as it keeps unfolding more and more throughout the duration of the film. But to sum it up, The Godfather is about ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the head of a New York Mafia family. After the Don is shot, the rest of the family has to step in during a violent mob war. After Vito steps down, Michael (Pacino) is forced to stand in as the new ""Don"" (head of the family). Keep in mind, this is only my poor summary, as it's much more interesting than I'm making it sound. Also starring James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire (Adrian of Rocky fame)This movie has been voted the #1 movie of all-time at [...] (it's not like they're the be-all, end-all of what's good and what isn't, but come on, 138,538 people can't be wrong!!), and is considered by most to be one of the 3 best movies ever. Needless to say, that's a lot of hype. Does it live up to it? Yes. The more I watch this, the more I like it. It's pretty much flawless in every way, and the twists & turns of the plot keep it entertaining. The end is so simple, yet so awesome at the same time. Of course, there's also good performances all around from the great cast. *****. Highly recommended to anyone who knows quality movies, and likes dramas.The Godfather: Part IIIn the 1950's, Don Michael Corleone attempts to expand the family business, and deals with an assassination attempt. In the end, Michael makes a ruthless decision that'll haunt him for the rest of his life. Also, we see how a young Vito Corleone (played by Robert De Niro) rose up from a petty breadmaker to the head of a Mob organization. The brilliant aspect of telling these two stories together is how they contrast so much. As Vito became more and more of a family man, Michael alienates himself with every decision he makes. Vito starts off alone and ends up surrounded by family and friends, while Michael starts off surrounded with family and friends, and ends up alone. I don't want to spoil too much here, but the end perfectly captures this message. Once again, something so simple can be so powerful at the same time. Most of the cast is the same, only Marlon Brando isn't in this one, and James Caan only has one scene (the flashback sequence at the end)While not as good as the original, it's still an excellent film on it's own right. The only problem that I had is the fact that it's a lot slower than the first. While the original had a good plot that moved along nicely, Part II sort of stretched some storylines out a little. But, every scene is essential to the plot, and there's no real filler. Other than that, Pacino was fantastic here, probably his best performance yet. His acting was a huge step up from the first one (which is saying something, since he was pretty good in the first one). Robert De Niro was a nice addition ina role where 99% of his lines were done in Italian. Overall, a definite *****.The Godfather: Part IIITaking place about 20 years after the last movie, a regretful Michael Corleone tries to legitimize the family business by joining with the Vatican and getting out of the violent mob underworld. He quickly learns that this is hard to do, as rivals such as Altobello (Eli Wallach, best known as Tuco from The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly) and Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna, voice of Fat Tony from The Simpsons) conflict things. Along the way, Michael has to deal with his fiery nephew (Andy Garcia), who's interested in his daughter (Sofia Coppola, daughter of director Francis Ford Coppola).Okay, where do I begin? This is an uncalled for, un-needed, and unnecessary sequel. I suppose it's good for those that absolutely need closure, but Part III is not even in the same league as the first 2. The cousins as lovers was pointless, and just plain sick. Apart from Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire, none of the actors from the first 2 appear. But you know what the worst thing is about The Godfather part III? Sofia Coppola. Most fans agree: she definitely ruined this movie (okay, maybe I wouldn't go that far, but she ruined every scne she was in). She's just terrible in every way, and it's absolutely unforgivable to put her in such a big role. One of the worst casting decisions ever. Apart from that, Pacino gives his usual good performance, and Keaton does a nice job as well. Garcia is decent, but doesn't have the magic that James Caan and Robert Duvall before him had. Not to mention, he's put in a limited role, and never given a chance to fully display his angry side. Overall, I give this ***1/2. There are a few good scenes, but on the flip side, there are a few terrible scenes as well. To put it simply, this movie fails to really hold your interest. Unlike the last two, there are quite a few throwaway scenes (actually, everything with Garcia and Coppola interacting is throwaway). It feels like they stretched things out just so this could be around the 3 hour mark like the previous two. Slightly recommended, as the ending was great, but a real letdown nonetheless."	5.0	Legendary.	2005-10-15	7	4	3

I guess what strikes me the most is the way Michael totally missintrptets his role as the head of the family.  And Family is the key word here.  He takes what his father has built and destroys it because he forgets what family means.  That one thing is why The Godfather movies are so good.  Coppola in showing the rise and fall of Michael Corleone makes a a point of what absolute power does to a person.  A Masterpiece of film making.

Francis Ford Coppola is truely a genius and the greatest director ever. The Godfather II was also a powerful movie as it show two sides of the story and how the Corleone family came to power and how the current leader is losing control.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A760WOI3DHCSP	Jaime	I'm not quite sure if it's possible to surpass THE GODFATHER series in terms of pure artistic beauty. The imagery is wrought with the emotions of the film and the characters, the Italian-language moments are scripted well and interjected at the best times, and the acting (among other things such as the directing and cinematography) is superb. It's a travesty, it really is, that Al Pacino never won an Oscar for these films. The extras, including commentaries, are very well done and don't ruin the integrity of the film, as so many DVD extras often seem to do.I've loved these films since I was a little girl; even then, I was able to discern the circumstances and fabulousness of the characters. This is due to Francis Ford Coppola's unceasing vision. Although Part III is clearly the least of the trio, it is the necessary conclusion that the series needs. Perhaps if it had been brought to the screen sooner after Part II, the vision would have been less interrupted. However, all three are remarkably well done -- I hate to repeat myself, but nothing surpasses THE GODFATHER.	5.0	Flawless filmmaking*	2005-07-23	2	2	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3RIIMSG5HB0J8	"""jake_l"""	"The Godfather films are all brilliant. The Godfather parts one and two are very similar in the way they were done,in that they glorify the mafia to a certin extent. The third film shows how a life of crime and sin takes it's toll. The change in feel could possibly be the reason some people don't like the third film.The GodfatherThis is the first of the outstanding Coppola trilogy. We open at Don Vito's (Marlon Brando) daughter's wedding. Then for the next three hours we are taken into the New York mafia through the eyes of Michael Chorleone(Al Pacino). This film makes you want to be in the mafia but upon analyzing the film you will find the reson for this, even though these men do terrible things they are doing for the family, so you forgive them. This film really stands out and holds the Acamedy Award for Best Picture of the Year.The Godfather Part TwoThis is exactly what they call it: a brilliant campanion piece to the orignal Godfather. Michael's (Al Pacino) rise is shown intertwined with the rise of Vito (Robert De Niro). This is in my opinion this best film ever made in America, with no insult intended to Citizen Kane. This film won the Acamedy Award for Best Picture of the Year.The Godfather Part ThreeThe Godfather Three is the worst of the three, but it is still a great film. The only problem in this film is the absence of Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and Andy Garcia's sterotypical Italian performance. Garcia is pretty fair in this movie though, but Al Pacino is, as always, an acting ""artist"". His performance is the best in all three films. This sequel changes the feel of the first two movies, a move not expected by most, but it still made for a great three hours.The Specil Features DiscThe Trilogy features some fantastic special features. Including a family tree, over thirty deleted scenes set up in the order they would have apeeared, a timeline, Academy Award exceptance speeches, trailors, and much more. Possibly the best special features of any DVD we have seen so far.Overall the set is worth the price and is a film that should definatly be viewed by anyone mature enough to handle it."	5.0	The Soprano's Are Great, But Why Not Have The Whole Choir!	2002-04-06	0	0	0
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2ITY3O2UPJLN8	J. Alec West	"The Godfather film timeline has one thing in common with the timeline of Jesus Christ ... the so-called ""missing years"" period.  In the original film, we see an aging Vito Corleone near the end of his ""Godfather"" period as the reigns of power are passed to Michael by circumstances outsite Vito's control or wishes.  Part II attempts to connect the dots in a ping-pong fashion - with half of the film devoted to Michael's life as it transpired following events in the original film, interrupted by flashbacks devoted to Vito's life from youth to young adulthood (the other half of the film).  Unfortunately, in doing Part II, the point between Vito's young adult life and mature life is left untouched - Vito's own ""missing years.""I'd always hoped Puzo/Coppola would later fill that vacuum with information, showing Vito's rise to power.  But, that never happened.  Even in the brief VHS release of ""The Godfather Epic"" (Part I & II told in chronological order), the vacuum remained unfilled.  This vacuum made it feel as if I'd seen only one-and-a-half films, not two.Of the three films, Part III is the only film that seems to answer all the questions the film intended to answer (except the ""what happens next"" question all epic films leave behind).  All three films, however, are worthy efforts with fine acting and brilliant storytelling.  And all three films are most deserving of the awards they received and for which they were nominated.That aside, however, I took one star away from my review because of those ""missing years.""  And though I know it's impossible at this late date, I'd give anything to see a chronological version released that takes those missing years into consideration."	4.0	Two-and-a-half movies crammed into three.	2006-04-02	7	4	3

The old DVD versions of The Godfather trilogy are rendered unwatchable compared to the blu-ray versions.  Always a dark movie series, both literally and figuratively, one can now see the details in the dimly lit scenes, such as within the office of Don Corleone during the wedding sequence of Godfather I.  I was unable to find scratch marks, dirt, etc. in these discs.  And the colors in the brightly illuminated outdoor shots of the wedding absolutely jump off the screen!  As always, Godfather I&II are the most compelling of the trio (I actually prefer, only slightly, Robert Deniro in II- only because of the delicious character developement of the Don; both Pacino and Deniro act magnificently as does Brando of course).  But even Godfather III, the weakest of the combo is a compelling movie to watch.  A must have for any serious afficianado of American film.	5.0	A Magnificent Classic in Blu-ray	2009-09-12	3	2	1

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3JT3NRIAQONA4	James	"With this Blu-ray, I have no objection to the grain level, the darkness, the washed-out whites; they all add to the effect and most of these ""flaws"" were part of Coppola's and his cinematographer's vision.  I think the film is stunning on Blu-ray; it's like watching it again for the first time, so many details I never noticed before.However, the super-saturated yellows of the film, very much a part of the artistic vision (Willis showed it to Coppola in the dailies after a day of shooting and Coppola loved the colors) I am sad to say I find too much to take for the length of the film.  I do love the golden yellows for about a half hour.  It's beautiful.  But I gotta reluctantly join the crowd who eventually, at some point in the otherwise blissful viewing, have to say, ""GOSH DAMN THIS IS SO ORANGE I'M GOING TO DIE!""The solution is easy.  It also may be seen by some as total heresy to be thumbsed down with all the power of God's own keystroke.  Go into your HD television's manual or advanced manual picture menu and turn down the color.  No, wait!  Don't kill me!  Hear me out.  I'm not saying to make it less yellow in relation to the other colors.  That, I admit, would be a sin.  But just turn all the colors down some.  And look at the result.  If you're like me, you won't want to love it.  It's too close to saying the film made a mistake in it's famous yellowness.  But frankly, with just a litlle desaturation, you can turn this near-radioactive yellowness into one of the most beautiful movies you ever saw.  The relief my eyes felt at the calmer colors relaxed me and I took in so much amazing detail.  After 50+ previous viewings of The Godfather, it was like I finally got to see it in all its glory.  The slightly desaturated, Blu-ray viewing of The Godfather is, in my opinion, the best home-viewing experience ever to be had.  Try it out.

This is not an innocent, family movie by no means. American movie theater patrons had never seen a movie so violent. The story content and the way it was filmed would change Hollywood movies forever.The Godfather is based on the life of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He has a large family in New York. This is the day of his daughter's wedding. Men that Mr. Corleone has been friends with are now coming to him for the help they need. He is a powerful man in New York. He is respectfully called ""Godfather"". One man tells Godfather, in his darkened office, that his daughter was raped. In order for Godfather to take care of the matter, you will be asked to do a job for him someday.Johnny Faontane (Al Martino) wants a part in a movie. The director, Jack Woltz, (John Marley) doesn't want him for the role. So The Godfather sends his private lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert DuVall) to California to talk to the director. As a friend, give The Godfather what he wants. The director refuses to put Johnny in his movie. Hagen says Mr. Corleone insists on hearing bad news immediately. By morning, the director finds out how serious Mr. Carleone is. Never refuse him and say ""No"".Cast: Marlon Brando, Robert DuVall, Al pacino, James Caan, Richard S.

First we are taken back to the past in 1901 in Sicily when Vito Corleone was only 9 years old (Oreste Baldini) and his father's funeral is taking place. His father was killed for making an insult to the mafia chieftain in Sicily. Over the course of the movie, we will see how the adult Vito (Robert DeNiro) became the powerful Godfather.Back to 1958, Michael (Al Pacino) now lives in Lake Tahoe and owns and controls two major hotels. He intends of acquiring four more hotels against the dislike of Senator Geary (G.D. Spradlin) who does not like the Corleone family in Nevada. Micheal tells the Senator he intends to pay nothing for the hotels and the Senator himself must put up the money for them for the licensing fee.Someone is after Micheal.Also in the cast: Robert DeNiro, Bruno Kirby Jr., Lee Strasberg, Danny Aiello, Gwen Verdon, Michael V. Gazzo, Troy Donahue, John Apera, Roger Corman.Al Pacino refines his performance as ""Michael Corleone"". Diane Keaton practically steals every scene as ""Kay"". Even Talia Shire gives her best.I noticed the background sound effects are well placed in this movie. Even a distant sound of a car-horn gives a scene, inside a room, more authenticity.If you have seen The Godfather (1972), the second movie, The Godfather, Part II (1974) must be seen.Also see, The Sicilian (1987)7 Academy Award Nominations. Won for Best Picture. Best Actor in a Supporting Role: Robert DeNiro. Art Direction-Set Direction. Best Director: Frances Ford Coppola.

I've seen all the GF episodes: theater, VHS, LaserDisc, DVD and now blu-ray, and this disk is the best.  I've also seen a broadcast of GF on HDTV, and the disks are still several notches better.As blu-ray allows, the colors are most striking and vibrant, images sharper than ever.  The audio track is clearest and well separated, and the menu system of the disks are unique and easier to navigate.  Alas, all the extras in this disk aside, what is most vital is having the film in your home in the best possible condition, and this disk exceeds the theatrical release easily, and won't disappoint.	5.0	Blu-ray is the best there is	2012-04-12	5	5	0

Both times, I have received the UK version instead of the US.  You can tell the difference because the UK version is an actual box set with 4 Blu-ray cases in it and a little ""15"" UK movie rating stamped on the front, whereas the US version is in a single thick Blu-ray case with all the discs in it.  The two items have different ASIC numbers, however, the UK versions that I've received both times have had a sticker placed on them with the US ASIC number.  The UK version is playable on US players, however, it does not include the original monaural audio tracks that the movies were released with theatrically and does not have the collectible booklet of the US release.  Both times that this happened, Amazon temporarily yanked it from their site until they resolved the stock problem, though it was never actually resolved.I was allowed to return the item both times, however, Amazon has explained to me that since they get this item from wholesalers, they can't guarantee that they are receiving the correct item.  While they were more than nice about it and ended up giving me a credit for my trouble, that still doesn't get me a copy of the US version of The Godfather Collection on Blu-ray for my collection.Buyer beware on this one.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1H0TNH8E7FWOY	Jason	The Godfather series was done brilliantly.  You really can't ask for any more from the I and II.  There is a little more to be desired of Part III - but it puts closure to the whole family and the business, so it is necessary.  The presence of Robert Duvall is missed as well.  It is interesting to see the kids of all the family (Sonny, Tom Hagen, etc).Anyway.  Part I is amazing.  Brando does a magnificant job as Vito Corleone.  He plays the part perfectly.  The other characters are able to play very well off of the prestige he brings to the set.  Part II is another incrediable movie.  You see how Vito Corleone (DiNero) rose to power in NYC in the 1920s and you see Michael (Pacino) further solidify the power of the family in Nevada.  I find the 1920's portion to be very fascinating because you also see characters such as Clemenza and Tessio and how they aided Vito and how he helped them.  It just shows you the depth of the characters that are in the triology.The Godfather DVD set is a must for anyone who appreciates movies.  The actors are amazing in them: Marlon Brando, James Caan, Al Pacino, Robert DiNero, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Andy Garcia, and Bridget Fonda.The DVD set only enchances what Cappola has done.  The special features disc is very interesting as well.  It is great for those who love the movie.	5.0	Absolutely Brilliant	2002-01-09	2	1	1
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A6N5SXNCSY0HS	Jason	In films of recent memory, none has such chewable dialogue as The Godfather. Everyone of my friends (including me) have quoted these films until we are blue in the face...And guess what? Were still breathing! This eagerly anticipated DVD Set delievers all the goods. This &quot;Bonus&quot; disc has absolutely everything you ever wondered about the series of movies. The deleted scenes were just as good as the movie, so that proves that Francis Ford Coppola is a pure genius. The DVD has deleted scenes from part one, two, and three. They have the theatrical trailers (which are absolutely dreadful in quality as well as the deleted scenes) which is kind of weird to watch seeing I was born in 1979. The timeline is also good, along with the interviews with Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan and Robert DeNiro. But they don't have one thing to play back for all Fredo (John Cazale) fans. The DVD transfers on the DVD are not of the best quality, but you got to keep in mind the first and second were made in the early 1970's. The DVD widescreen was the most annoying thing. I love the &quot;2:35:1&quot; widescreen, but this has the &quot;1:85:1&quot; which is basically a full screen version on DVD! This triology is about the rise, fall, rise, fall, ect. of the Corleone mob family. It has blistering performances from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert DeNiro. The third is the one most disappointing, but hey for the 1st &amp; 2nd plus the bonus disc you get, the deal evens out. Also another bad thing is that the 2nd film is on 2-discs just like Pearl Harbor. But who does'nt have time to change the disc to see The Godfather Part II? For all loyal fans, the rumors on the market is that Coppola is remaking the box set. Which might add a better transfer, a better widescreen, and maybe more Godfather goodies? Lets Hope. If you have'nt seen The Godfather Triology, then what are you waiting on? If you love mob movies like Casino (Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci), Goodfellas (Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci), Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp, Al Pacino) and Once Upon A Time In America (Robert De Niro, James Woods). Then you better see these. Compare those to these and you can see the difference.	5.0	Everything The Ultimate Godfather Fan Wanted...Plus More!	2002-06-26	2	2	0

If you are reading this then I am sure you already know this, so I am not going to spend any time on going into that.  What I would like to comment on is the artistic process that went into this film and some people's dislike of it on here.Reading through the comments here I noticed that many of the three star reviews and less complain about it being too grainy and that they ""upscaled"" it to 1080p and that even 2001 looks better on Blu-Ray.  Worst of all are the people that complain about the yellowish/orangish hue in the first movie and that they are dark.  These people really don't know anything about the technology and as a result their comments are meaningless.  First of all; the films were shot dark on purpose.  That was an artistic choice, and I think it helps make it feel more like America in the 1940s.  Then there are those that say that video was upscaled because it's a 70's film and that 2001 looks better.  This is laughable.  How can these people call themselves fans of film, but yet know nothing about the technology. All three of the Godfather movies are shot on 35mm film.  Modern movies that aren't shot digitally are usually shot on 35mm film. (it's the standard) 2001 was shot on 70mm film hence.  This allows for a higher resolution when transferring to digital.  The reason the first film looks so grainy is because they made so many copies from the original negatives, that they were destroyed. They had to do a world wide search to find the very best negatives to make a new master with.  All of which were copies from the original. That's why some parts look better than others.  It's what they had to work with.  The yellowish/orangish hue was done on purpose in post production as an artistic choice.I am sure even with all this said people will still complain and would prefer that they have a a very sterile, grainless, perfect color balance digital feel that digital cameras can give.  I for one prefer film for the master.  It looks far better in my opinion and gives films their own unique feel.  This is something I feel with be lost when everything eventually goes digital and the digital post production will look faked.To sum everything up; If you are a film fan, these are a must have in your collection.  The restoration in every detail is as good as it's going to get with what was available.  Even the soundtrack is as equally amazing in restoration as the video is.  Enjoy it in all it's greatness."	5.0	Ignore everything below 3 stars because they haven't done any research into their dislikes	2010-10-23	22	21	1

More often than not the movies where a diversion, but the God Father, and God Father II were excellent movies. Personally I felt The Good Father III lacked in sincerity what the others did, but when I heard they were coming out on DVD I couldn't wait.Last Tuesday at 10:00 am the 5 disk set hit the stores; I was waiting at the door at 9:59 am. Today I finished all three, it was time for the extra goodies, but to my dismay only 20% of the fifth disk played.  I exchanged the disk at the store where I purchased them, but yet again the fifth disk wouldn't play on my system. I had to get a magnifying glass out to read that some special features wouldn't play on all DVD units.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A319UZO0YT456V	"Jeff ""jjb21"""	Part I not only has two unbelievable performances from Al Pacino (Michael) and Marlon Brando (Vito), but James Caan (Sonny) and Robert Duvall (Tom) also put forth a less well known performance. It does take some paying attention, but when you understand everything and take everything in as one, the movie gives you an undescribable feeling. It lets you see how these mobsters operated and how they acted. It also lets you see the way these men viewed themselves and their business. And seeing the once innocent Michael Corleone turn into the man he becomes by the end is very intriguing.Robert De Niro in Part II is simply amazing. He isn't Marlon Brando, but he was Vito Corleone. Al Pacino continues his excellence. And John Cazale's performance of Fredo was also very honorable. I believe most prefer Part I, however, I think Part II has a slight edge (but really they should be thought of as one, anyway). The segments where Don Vito Corleone establishes his family are most interesting. And seeing the continuation of Michael's corruption in incredible.Part III is a good third part, but does not quite compare with the first two, though it is enjoyable, and nice to own alongside Parts I and II.The Bonus Features are decent. It does contain some nice things, but there was definitely room for improvement.	5.0	The Greatest 2 Movies Of All Time	2003-08-09	0	0	0

Recent advances in technology in the film industry, that are capable of enhancing the film's look, sound and overall quality are here.  Blu-Ray format is perfect for the job.  I have the utmost trust in these skilled men to bring the film into the 21st Century.  May I offer a suggestion during the restoration, to allow some editing and splicing of the film to allow the film to follow it's chronological order.

The Godfather films ... big time. I day dreamed during the first two. I didn't watch the third one. I only watched the first two because of Cinema class I had my senior year during high school. Don't waste your time on this piece of garbage. It's not worth it. I would not recomend watching this movie even if it was for free. Find another movie to watch you will be glad that you did. The Godfather ... big time. I did not find any enjoyment out of the first two movies, except for when they were over. I wanted to jump up and down when they were over. I have seen tons of movies and there are only three movies that I do not like. I don't like the first two Godfather movies, and a horror movie that I can't remember the name of. In other words stay as far away as you can from the Godfather movies. You will be glad that you did.	1.0	The Godfather collection is the worst!!	2003-02-12	89	6	83

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AX8E62PSNJ0UL	Jennifer Knight	The Godfather [parts 1-3] to me is simply the best movie I have ever seen. Many times i have turned to the Godfather moive to see how Michael Corleon [Al Pacino]would handel a problem. It's hard to think that no sequal to a movie could beat the first, but Francis Ford Coppola did it.  I have to admit the second is better than the first and the third lacks in the long run, but over all it ranks on top.  The DVD collection is the one thing that could keep me up all night.  Wathching out takes, acadamy award speeches, the director and actors speaking about making the movie, and wathching deleted materials is simply the best.  So if you ever have a problem and have no solution turn to the Godfather DVD collection for all the right answers!	5.0	Simply the Best	2001-10-09	0	0	0
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AK1WMQS14B7C0	Jeremiah McNeil	Francis Ford Coppola's &quot;The Godfather&quot; is perfect. This is a film that uses perhaps the greatest performance in cinema (Al Pacino as Michael Corleone), a plethora of spectacular supporting roles (Marlon Brando is magnificent as Vito- the funeral home scene), evocative cinematography, powerful imagery, and a screenplay of great emotional magnitude to send us down the path to the destruction of the human soul. It introduces itself systematically, and once we have entered the mafia fold, we are in the inner circle. There is no escape. Watch the film for its construction: the editing, the cinematography, the structure of every scene, and how each one builds off the last to bring us to greater intimacy with this vehicle of destruction, this &quot;family&quot;. Watch for the progression (regression) of the character Michael. Watch for the performances, so starkly realistic, so warm, so touching, so unforgivingly cold. Watch for the ending: one of cinema's emotional hallmarks. Watch it because it is perhaps the greatest film of all time.	5.0	Into the Family	2001-11-16	1	1	0

Why he decided that it would be a better movie if he cut scenes is beyond me. For example, he cut out the scene of Michael and Kay at the hotel, not answering the phone. Instead they show Michael and Kay returning from a movie and Kay seeing a newspaper with the news of the shooting of the Godfather. No explanation why they didn't know until long after everyone else knew.While Michael is in Corleone he marries a beautiful local girl who is killed by one of Michael's bodyguards. The scene showing the revenge killing of the bodyguard in America, is cut.In Godfather 2 the scenes of Vito's revenge on the guards that searched for him when he was a young boy, threatening anyone that would help him, cut. You get the idea, many scenes known to the fans of these movies were cut by the director! I am confident that many fans were disappointed by this version of the films and the numerous missing scenes.	2.0	Godfather Cut?	2012-03-28	6	4	2
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	ALTNI5BAFUAQY	"Jery Tillotson ""cult author"""	The passage of nearly 40 years hasn't been kind to this series of films. What was dazzling and electrifying to audiences back then, has been dulled by countless imitations--specifically the cable smash, The Sopranos.In the original Godfather, performances still impress, especially Marlon Brando. Robert DiNiro in the sequel is still powerful.  But the way these movies were made, with long, long unbroken shots, a leisurely way of telling the story now come close to being boring. We have much dialogue, followed by silences and reaction shots, and many of us are impatient for something to happen.  In the beginning marriage sequence that starts The Godfather, minutes tick by until thirty minutes later, we're finally into a different scene.Some Oscar winning movies that were smash hits upon release sadly to not hold up for modern audiences.  The Godfather saga is one of them.	3.0	A Dissapointing Reviewing	2009-03-03	22	2	20

I bought it for my wife for a Christmas gift (she is a huge Godfather fan and we just got a new 52"" Bravia and a PS3) and it was a HUGE disappointment! Maybe I misunderstood what was meant by 'restoration' but I thought the blu-ray would be comparable to other blu-ray movies, not so. The quality of the picture was, to us, indistinguishable from the DVD played through the PS3 (which upconverts). I wish I could return the thing, there are so many other movies for which I could shell out $59 (what it cost on Amazon when I bought it; the price dropped to $49 the next day but it had already shipped)."	1.0	Save your money.....	2010-01-12	32	10	22
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A45IDQJYQVAGC	J. Garner	"As I slowly upgrade my DVD collection to Blu-ray (a process I expect to finish right around the time Blu-ray's replacement becomes common), I caught this set on sale and snapped it up without a moment's hesitation. I already owned the 4-disc DVD collection that came out in 2001, and all things considered, I probably should have just stuck with that edition.That's not to say there's anything wrong with this collection. There isn't. It's as perfect as can be - not just the films themselves, but the transfer and the presentation as well. The extras are excellent, as well. Parts of the transfer are better than the older DVD edition. And strangely, that's the problem.Over the years, the original negatives for the first two films were essentially destroyed. A great effort at restoration has been made for this collection, and where it worked, the effect is stunning. In those scenes, the film looks like it was shot yesterday - perhaps not as sharp as one might expect, but the colors are vibrant and edges are much sharper than before, without losing that beautiful grain or the warmed tones so characteristic of these films.That's where the restoration worked. In some scenes, however, scans had to be taken from different prints, or so much reconstruction was necessary that the finished scene simply looks different from the ones before and after it. These interludes are brief and rare, but I found them difficult to ignore. Conversely, watching the DVD with upscaling in my BD player - even though that transfer was roundly criticized for being dark and somewhat murky - offers a much more uniform ""look"" throughout viewing, and with nearly the same level of sharpness. It's less distracting.If you don't already own a copy of this utter masterpiece, shame on you, buy this right now. If you don't think you'll be as annoyed by the visual inconsistency as I am, buy it. You'll rarely find treasure for so low a price. I certainly plan to keep my copy, and will in all likelihood part with the DVD (the Blu-ray has the distinct advantage of taking up half as much shelf space) but this is one of those rare times when I would have liked an ""unrestored"" option to be available. With only one film per disc, there certainly was enough room."	5.0	Worth buying if you don't have the DVD set	2013-01-29	5	5	0

Malta ""jgeoff.com"""	Francis Ford Coppola and Paramount Home Entertainment held a press conference and street fair in Brooklyn, and yours truly was there! The exciting news, of course, was announcing the release of THE GODFATHER DVD COLLECTION on October 9, 2001! If the preview of the set is any indication, then I must say this will be the crown jewel in any DVD collection!The three films will only be released together in this set. The Godfather and The Godfather Part III will each be on one disc, and The Godfather Part II will take two discs. The first of the good news? Francis Coppola has recorded full-lenth audio commentaries for all three films!But wait, there's a fifth disc that will blow your socks off! Check this out -- the bonus disc contains 3+ hours worth of special features, including:  &gt; &quot;The Godfather Family: A Look Inside&quot; documentary  &gt; &quot;Francis Coppola's Notebook&quot;, an inside look at taking the book to screen!  &gt; &quot;On Location&quot; with production designer Dean Tavoularis!  &gt; &quot;The Godfather Behind The Scenes&quot; 1971 featurette!  &gt; &quot;The Cinematography of The Godfather&quot;!  &gt; &quot;The Music of The Godfather&quot; -- two featurettes!  &gt; &quot;Coppola and Puzo on Screenwriting&quot;!  &gt; Storyboards from GF2 and GF3!  &gt; &quot;The Corleone Family Tree&quot; character and cast bios!  &gt; Academy Award acceptance speeches!  &gt; Photo galleries with captions!  &gt; Theatrical trailers!  &gt; Filmmaker bios!  &gt; Corleone Family timeline, with real-life events mixed in!  &gt; Never-seen alternate opening of GF3!  &gt; And &quot;all&quot; of the extra footage found in the televised Godfather Saga!The picture quality looked fantastic -- Coppola's American Zoetrope did a wonderful job restoring the films! From what I could tell, the sound quality was perfect, and the on-screen menus looked great. And the DVD packaging looks very nice.All three films are in widescreen format with English 5.1 surround sound, French mono, and English subtitles.Perhaps the only &quot;bad&quot; news I heard was that there were no plans at this point to release the chronological version on DVD. Francis said that the films were meant to be seen with the flashbacks, and I tend to agree. The biggest plus of having The Godfather Trilogy or Epic on tape, or watching The Godfather Saga on TV, was all the extra footage included. Well, the bonus disc in The Godfather DVD Collection contains &quot;all&quot; of the extra footage, and even something we've never seen anywhere before: an alternate opening for The Godfather Part III. Francis didn't give a firm &quot;no&quot; though; he cited technical reasons for not being able to include all the extra footage on DVD: the different scenes are in various levels of production (&quot;they weren't mixed and scored&quot;), making it difficult to add them seemlessly with today's technology. Maybe, but they seemed to be okay in the boxed sets and on TV to me.Do yourself a favor and order the biggest DVD release of all time!	5.0	If there was ever an offer you couldn't refuse, it's this!	2001-06-12	1019	927	92

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AFMWLT45X9H4R	Jim Toms	This, along with Citizen Kane, in my opinion is the reason DVD players were made. Having all three of these movies along with one disc devoted entirely to extras is a treat in every sense of the word (Is there more than one? Oh well.).  This film, along with other great films on DVD (Jaws comes to mind), is finally getting the justice it deserves by being available in widescreen: the way the filmmaker intended.  You'll never want to watch it on cable again.Of course we have a great story with great actors in a great looking film in the first Godfather. Who can forget the opening first shot as the camera slowly moves backward over Brando's right shoulder? On the extras disc we get an alternate opening to Part III that used a similar shot where Coppola wanted the camera to do the same thing over Pacino's shoulder while being asked an important favor by a Catholic bishop. However, he decided to scrap the opening, deciding that the focus should be on family, not business.  The film itself is great as we watch the daily goings-on of the Corleone family, the violence that can't be kept out, and the end of one Don and the rise of an unlikely other.Part II is longer and also has a compelling story, but just isn't quite as good as the first. Don't get me wrong, it's a great film and I like it a lot, but the charm of the first film is lacking as we see Michael fully in charge and working with a ruthless efficiency to get what he wants.  By this time, the family has been forced out of New York (due to Michael's massive hit on the other families) and are controlling hotels and shady gambling operations in Las Vegas. One of the last scenes of the film, which is a flashback to earlier, happier days as the family is about to give a surprise party for Don Vito, is one of the best in film history.Part III, which was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar in 1990, is still a pretty good film, and worthy contribution to the continuing story, although it's not quite up to the caliber of the other two.  Here we have Michael trying to keep the family operation in legitimate businesses only, but as fate would have it, every time he thinks he's out they pull him back in (sorry, I couldn't help myself). The final scene, which is supposed to echo Brando's death scene in the first film, doesn't quite work because it seems so short and rushed, almost as if Coppola was saying let's hurry and get this shot because we have to have it in the movie.The extras disc is packed with quality stuff including a great &quot;making of&quot; documentary that pulls out all the stops. There's even a screen test of Martin Sheen reading for the part of Michael(!).  There's also Oscar acceptance speeches, an original 1971 featurette that was shot while the first Godfather was in production and many, many deleted scenes from each film, along with lots of other stuff.  Anyone building a serious DVD collection must have this. You won't be disappointed, unlike Michael with Fredo.	5.0	How could anyone give it fewer than five stars?	2002-01-13	2	2	0

If you are unsure about The Godfather Series, just read one of the in depth reviews of the actual film.  This set though is nice and worth it if you get a good deal like I did.I will say though, this is an older film and isn't laser sharp like new movies on Blu Ray.  Just be aware, it fits your screen perfectly, has been restored, has great sound, but it isn't like watching Toy Story 3 in Blu Ray...	5.0	Great Deal	2013-02-14	0	0	0

But the transfers are horrendous, to say the least. Even Part 3, released in 1990, looks terrible. I've seen it look better on cable, so it's not as if there aren't better versions around. To all prospective buyers- rent it or borrow from a friend and see for yourself. ... Paramount should be ashamed of itself for taking the time to make a beautiful box, only to deprive us of a beautiful transfer.	1.0	Great movies- horrible DVD transfer	2001-10-15	23	13	10

I have a 60"" Sony 1080p, PS3, and a High end 7.1 Pioneer Home theater. So I can tell you that this both looks and sounds better then I ever remember it. If your a fan of the Godfather and you don't have the collection on DVD. Then this is a must buy! If you do have the collection on DVD you still might consider upgrading, I would. The only thing I want to comment on is the case itself. It's very hard to get the disks to pop out, I feel like I am going to break them every time and it concerns me.

This is what a DVD should be: extras, commentaries, deleted scenes, on location specials, &quot;making-of&quot; specials... the only thing this set does not give you is a whacking.I picked up my copy yesterday and played with the &quot;extras&quot; disc for about 2 hours. It has everything you've ever wanted to know about &quot;The Godfather&quot; and then some! The extras are splendid, but the movie is what we all want, right? You get all three of them in DVD quality picture and sound in their original theatrical ratio. You just can't lose!The only, tiny, minuscule little thing I don't care for is the packaging of the set. I was hoping for something a little less flimsy as the cardboard cases. I would have preferred the plastic cases, but that really is the only complaint I have about this set.&quot;The Godfather&quot; set the standards for drama motion pictures. Now this DVD set will set the standards for all future releases. You will be spoiled with this set, but it is soooo worth it.	5.0	The greatest DVD of all time.	2001-10-13	0	0	0

When I went from VHS to DVD, there was a HUGE difference in picture and sound quality. I loved it! So I decided, well since I got the blu-ray, let me get the blu-ray version of one of my all time favorite trilogies! Heck it is the The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration set, so the picture has to be UNREAL. Popped it in and the title menu was pretty grainey. So that was disappointing but I figure, just the title, no big deal. So I site back, get ready to experience my godfather flick in Blu-Ray, hit play and......WOW! STILL GRAINEY!! So really I was not sure why I just got rid of the DVD version to get the Blu-ray version!? But it is still the Godfather, I love the flick and can never get enough. If you have the DVD version, dont waist your money to get the blu-ray. There is not much of a change in picture quality.	3.0	Not worth the Blu-Ray	2010-07-14	17	7	10

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1WLKLB2YD3CI2	Jo Blow	I had never seen the Godfather until last week.  You see, I really didn't think I would like it; almost every video I own is either science fiction or comedy, so this film never sounded appealing to me.  Gangsters?  Blood,  murder, and death?  I'm a sensitive gal; I was certain that a film of this  sort would hold no interest for me.  My fiance wanted to see it, though, so  we rented it and I was entranced from the beginning.  Every performance is  incredible and the action and intrigue are nonstop.  I literally could not  stop watching.  The depth of the characters and how beautifully the actors  bring that across would be enough to make it a worthwhile film, but add  that to a plot, filled with enough twists and turns to keep you breathless,  and the movie is darn near perfect.  I didn't even want to watch this film  a week ago; now I will purchase it as soon as it comes out on DVD.  I would  highly recommend it to anyone.	5.0	What an incredible film!	2000-02-20	1	1	0

This isn't it. I'm talking about the 1981 VHS release of the first two films combined into one, in chronological order with additional scenes. Godfather II, as everyone knows, contains flashbacks which don't necessarily add to the narrative. Tell the story in the order it takes place, throw in some lost footage, and add the third film to that, and we have an awesome epic film that isn't interrupted by 3 sets of opening and closing credits, telling one continuous epic story... 1902-1979.This release has its place for purists, but I want the saga edition."	5.0	"what about ""The Complete Epic""?"	2008-08-02	21	8	13

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1F6DHVFE1ZIXX	John	This is one of the best put together DVD's ever, and, without a doubt the best DVD in my collection (which includes Fight Club, another fine movie and DVD).  The picture and sound are both of the highest quality, but unfortunately I have only a crappy 27 in. TV and no surround sound system.  Therefore, when I watched it over my friend's house (he has surround sound and a nice TV) it was really breathtaking.THE GODFATHER I is, in my personal opinion and the personal opinion of many others, the single best film ever to grace the silver screen.  It also has the highest rewatchability of any movie I have seen and I have seen quite a few.  You all probably know the plot, but for those of you who don't, it is basically about a crime family, the Corleone Family, from New York.  It begins with the now famous Wedding scene where the whole story is set up and characters are introduced.  From there it goes to what probably is business as usual in the Mafia-business deals, various murders, family problems, etc...  It culminates in a wonderful scene that intertwines several murders (I won't say of who for those who don't know)with a baptism (I love how the priest says &quot;Do you reject Satan?&quot; and then as Michael answers yes someone is killed and so on).  I suggest that you watch it with someone else who has already scene it because it may confuse you a little the first time and also it is fun for the other person to explain the parts of the movie.THE GODFATHER II is a continuation, of course, of the first Godfather.  It picks up the story about 7 years later and tells the tale of Micheal Corleone running his family in I think the 50's and also of young Vito Corleone (Micheal Corleone's father played by an also young Robert De Niro).  Some people I heard have been slightly turned off by all the Italian and subtitles used in the young Vito parts, but, being Italian and having taken 2 years of the language, I had no problems with it.  Don't worry though, except for the coming to America part, it is filled with all the great action as the 50's era part of the movie.  I love the part where Vito stalks Fanucci and then kills him with the towel wrapped around the gun as an makeshift silencer.  In the 50's part, Micheal Corleone is becoming almost evil in his coldness and ruthlessness, to a point of doing something that I can't ever imagine doing myself.  Al Pacino is in top form in this movie, but I think that John Cazale's performance was even better and should have won an Ocar.  I hate the fact that he always goes unnoticed in reviews of this movie.  The &quot;It ain't what I wanted!!&quot; scene where Micheal disowns Fredo (sorry for giving away a plot point) is perhaps the best example of dramatic acting ever.THE GODFATHER III.  There are about a million reviews that pretty much say that this is the worst movie ever.  I disagree.  Yes, Sofia Coppola did not belong in that role (or any important role).  Yes, Joe Mantegna was poorly casted in the role of Joey Zazza (if that's how you spell it) even though he wasn't as bad as Sofia.  Yes, the plot wasn't as good as the first two.  BUT, look what this movie is being compared to.  Two of the best movie ever to come out.  Just because this is a good movie as opposed to a masterpiece like the others doesn't make it bad.  It is not bad.The special features are many.  There are several documentaries, many deleted scenes, commentaries on all 3 movies, etc...  The bonus disc will keep you busy for hours after you have already seen the films.  If you like these movies, I suggest that you also see Goodfellas which is in the same vane as this and is also one of the greatest movies ever.	5.0	&quot;A man who hasn't seen the Godfather can never be a real man	2001-11-27	9	5	4
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	ARDG26MFBQQ52	John Hopper	I have alwasy love &#34;The Godfather&#34; and &#34;The Godfather part 2&#34;. They are great movies. Unfortunately, &#34;The Godfather part 3&#34; was just a way for Coppola to grab more money off the Godfather name. It should had never been made. If you pay close attention to part 3, it just a replay of the other two movies, without the great story line behind them. IMO, it's a toatal waste.The Blu-ray version is very good PQ. It's what these movies needed, specially after all these years. If you're a fan of &#34;The Godfather&#34; movies, you should get this Blu-ray. For me &#34;The Godfather is a movie I can watch over & over.I have one wish. That Coppola would release in Blu-ray &#34;The Godfather Saga&#34;. This was on tv many, many years ago...I believe on Bravo as a mini series, (before Bravo went to the trash reality shows.) It showed the story of the Godfather and Godfather 2, but in  chronological order. It starts in Sicily like part 2, and takes you all the way to where Michael takes over as Godfather. I can't remember if it takes you to Las Vegas and where Michael becomes so paranoid. But IMO, it's the greatest version of the Godfather that was ever made.(This was way before Godfather part 3 was even an ideal.)So get it and get a few cannolies to have when watching it...oh, don't forget, leave the gun, but take the cannolies!	5.0	What can I say....It's a classic, with 1 & 2 being the best.	2013-03-26	0	0	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2TDK8D4HEMUYW	"John ""MovieAddict"""	"When Francis Ford Coppola returned to direct &quot;The Godfather Part II,&quot; his mission was to create a sequel as compelling, involving, interesting, and downright exhilarating as the original. Everyone told him it was impossible. He made the impossible possible.This sequel is just as terrific as the first film, if not more so. I hesitate to call it a sequel, as &quot;sequel&quot; is quite simply the wrong word I am looking for. A film like &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; is a sequel - a blockbuster blast that returns the characters from the original in a new storyline. &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; is something more. It is more of a chapter than a sequel. A continuation, if you will. The same characters are all here - at least those who survived the original, that is - but when I call it a &quot;sequel,&quot; it strikes the wrong cord. It is as if both films are one, divided into two separate chapters. When you read a novel, and someone asks you if you liked it, you don't say, &quot;Yeah, but I liked the first chapter better than the second and so on.&quot; You either like or dislike the novel. Think of &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; as a chapter in a novel; it is a true continuation, nothing more.This film won six Oscars in 1974, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro). It deserved every one. It involves the viewer from the start and never lets up. Particular aspects I enjoy in this film are the flashbacks to Don Vito Corleone as a child immigrating to New York City after social problems in his homeland, Sicily. I like the intertwining of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), his son, in present day, dealing with his crime inheritance, and Vito (Robert De Niro), his father, years ago. I like how, as Michael comes to terms with his family legacy, the film shows us Vito coming to terms with his future. The day he shoots that man in a gritty apartment complex is a turning point in his life.As I write this review, &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; holds the no. 3 spot on the IMDb's list of the top 250 films of all time. ""The Godfather"" is currently taking the no. 1 spot. I guess people still do have good taste in film - but the fact that &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; made it to the no. 1 spot for close to a month startles me just a bit. Are filmgoers so cinematically naive nowadays to vote every blockbuster they see a &quot;10&quot;?Every actor is in top form here. Al Pacino has gradually made the move from a man who denies his future to a man who is accepting it. His character is the spotlight of this film, much more so than in the first film (though both center around his decisions).Robert De Niro is particularly wonderful and convincing as a young Vito Corleone, who was of course played by the constantly-spoofed Marlon Brando in the original. De Niro takes an iron grip on his character and completely engulfs himself; this was, in 1974, the sign of an actor who would go places. Indeed, he did. Among his other film contributions was Martin Scorsese's classic tale of loneliness, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;; Michael Simino's tale of friendship, &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;; Martin Scorsese's fact-based drama &quot;Raging Bull,&quot; based on the life of boxer Jake LaMotta; Sergio Leone's true epic &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;; as Al Capone in &quot;The Untouchables&quot;; and Martin Scorsese's true story of gangsters in &quot;Goodfellas.&quot;Coppola's magical sense of direction is at work here, as is the terrific script by Coppola and Mario Puzo (whose novels the series is based upon). The original was a wonderful film, with wonderful direction, but the sequel presents more of a challenge. Flashbacks are often intercut in the middle of a film at the wrong time; Coppola inserts his flashbacks here like clockwork, ticking back and forth and coming into play right when the audience either (a) wants them or (b) does not want them, which is always the best thing. Sometimes an audience wants a flashback if they're getting tired of a scene - sometimes they don't want a flashback because they are involved in a current story and are hooked on the screen. Coppola inserts his flashbacks at just the right moments. If he feels a scene is too long, he gets a flashback going. If he feels the current story could benefit from a flashback that is reminiscent of the current matters, he inserts one. And if the audience is at the height of tension, awaiting the end of a scene, he will insert a flashback and the audience will soon forget about the scene they were involved in minutes ago - until the flashback is over and the &quot;present time&quot; scene starts up again. Then they are really at attention.It takes a great kind of skill to master something like this, much less a sequel to one of the most beloved films of all time. &quot;The Godfather&quot; was an instant classic upon its release in 1972. Coppola had two years to plan for his continuation of the film. People told him it wouldn't work, he would never beat the original, and he would never pull it off. But he showed them all. &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; may well be the best sequel I have ever seen in my entire lifetime. Oh boy, there I go again with that word, &quot;sequel.&quot; I really hate that word. Continuation: That's a word I really have to keep in mind next time I'm coughing up a review on a sequel. Argh, there I go again. D'oh!"	5.0	A review on the second offer you can't refuse...	2003-10-16	1	1	0

Just buy it and you'll see what I mean. I promise you that you won't be disappointedHowever, the DVD is reviewable. This is a DVD Collector's dream. The wealth of bonus material (documentaries, deleted scenes, story boards) is overwhelming. You will have to spend hours and hours just to see all of the features once. The real gem of these discs are the feature director's commentary that director Francis Ford Coppola gives for all three films. He will tell you everything you need to know about each scene as you watch.The picture quality is pretty good. A little bit of grain and artifacts but you won't notice the film will engross you. It was put into 1.85:1 format ratio for the DVD which gives you more to see (left to right). You'll have to sacrifice some of the top and bottom of the usual prints but it's worth it. The new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack for each film is good as well. It's not earth shattering, but it'll get the job done.This is the Ultimate Godfather edition that anyone can ask for.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A935UOT5LJZV2	JOHNNY	What can one say about The Godfather series? All three films were masterpieces. Classics. Part One told the tale of Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando--the Mafia Don of a family in the 40's and 50's, which eventually is head by his son, Michael (Al Pacino) in the sequel. Part Two also tells the story of Vito as a young man in Sicily played by Robert DeNiro. In the final installment set about twenty years after the original, Michael's dreams of becoming legit are countered by his trigger-happy nephew (Andy Garcia), along with new and opposing foes that make it impossible to go straight and leave his crime backround behind. To quote Pacino: &quot;Just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in,&quot; and countless other lines will be quoted for years to come. The performances are absolutely perfect, the screenplay and direction are superb by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. What more can I say? You must watch all three to appreciate just how great these movies are. At three hours apiece they would be great fun for a rainy day. Pop them in at 8 in the morning and by 6 you'll be a member of the family.  Part One is my favorite. Check out GoodFellas, another one of the best films of all time.	5.0	The Godfather Series: Movies You CANNOT Refuse.	2000-10-09	6	3	3

Suffice to say that I agree with the detractors. It is nice to hear that first line &quot;I believe in America&quot;. Some may be dissappointed by the 4th disc. The &quot;documentary section&quot; seems to me to be a lengthy justification for Part III. I really wanted to see more behind the scenes footage from I and II. The &quot;deleted scenes&quot; are fantastic and I wonder if we will ever get &quot;The Epic&quot; on DVD. I think It is a much more complete story.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A16YMAQ8VHNHRF	"John Zakibe ""book and movie lover"""	"There is little doubt in mind that The Godfather Trilogy is the best series ever made for film.  It is an outstanding achievement, one which I often compare other films too.  How many times have I commented, ""Well, its no Godfather, but it is a good movie"" are many.  There are many reasons that these film deserve the 5 star rating.  I will give you some of them now.The Godfather - there was nothing quite like the first time I saw the movie.  It was for an American Lit class.  One thing I have to say was that it was a phenomenal viewing experience.  Watching Marlon Brando act in this movie was simply a joy.  There were things that this movie did that I really appreciated.  It seemed to humanize gangsters and showed during typical everyday things.  I really liked seeing them eating Chinese take-out out of the box in came in.  Little touches about how one is drawn into the family; it becomes difficult to actually ever leave.  The emphasis on ""business"" and you realize that these men would kill their own family if they had to.  Shocking to see!The Godfather Part II - In my opinion this is the best out of the trilogy.  That is not to say that this mocie is perfect.  There are sections of the movie that I find to be slow, such as the trip to Cuba, and emphasing so much on the revolution.  It was not necessarily a bad choice to do so, but needed to be cut down some.  It was nice to see how Don Corleone came to power. Rising from just a poor immigrant, to become the powerful man that he was.  Although, this film lacks a shocking, classic, memmorable scene that was found in the original (i.e. the horse head in the bed); it still was a stellar achievement in film making.The Godfather Part III - When judged on its own this movie is a good movie.  But when one tries to compare it to other two films it pales in the comparison.  However, that being said it did contain probably my favorite line in the whole trilogy: ""just when I think that I'm out, they pull me back in"".  What a fitting line really.  One can never leave the mafia.  They can never leave what made them who they are.  The obvious mistake in this movie was the casting of Sofia Copolla.  She was a poor choice, and at the end, I actually cheered when she was shot.  Not a moment too soon in my opinion.Over all this a great viewing experience.  Plan a weekend, and watch all three films together.  It will be a weekend well spent."	5.0	An Offer You Can't Refuise	2004-10-10	4	3	1

What a treasure to finally have these beautiful Blu-Ray versions to watch whenever I would like.  (At last, the 3rd installment is no longer dismissed as &#34;the unwanted step-child&#34; by programming elites!  It is right there, at my fingertips.)  There are a few additional featurettes on a fourth disc that all fans will savor.  I love one moment where Richard Belzer and another actor recite several classic (as well as &#34;deep cuts&#34;) lines from the trilogy, trying to &#34;out-Corleone&#34; each other.  It further illuminates just what a ubiquitous influence on our culture The Godfather films have had.  The transfer to dvd quality is GORGEOUS.	5.0	An Offer You Don't Wanna' Refuse	2014-03-06	0	0	0

You have to be either crazy or stupid to really think that.  Rather than go into yet another review of the films I will focus on the DVD set.  This would get 5 stars but what really irritates me is that there is no uncut or directors cut version of this on DVD.  There are MANY scenes missing and who the hell wants to have to wait until the end and put in yet another disc to see them.  I am guessing that I can only see that on the VHS box set.  But if anyone knows about how I can see this on dvd please e-mail me at josephmarkdavis@aol.com. In a perfect world Coppola would go back and re-do the Godfather III all over again.  Sophia Coppola is not pretty or alluring enough to be a lead.  That wouldn't matter if she could act but she can't do that either.  Not without having the most affected facial expressions on the face of the planet.  And not paying Robert Duval the money he wanted to do this film was perhaps his biggest mistake ever.  It just doesn't work or hold your interest without him in it.  It ends up being a sad and depressing effort with a couple of good action scenes.In my earlier criticism around the missing scenes, I am aware that they were foolishly left out of the theatrical release and were later added to the television broadcast but I think that they should be added back in now.  They really help to tie everything together.  Despite what some of these morons on here say, The Godfather I and II trumps every other mafia pieces out there including Goodfellas and The Sopranos.  They do unfortunately romanticize the mafia, particularly with certain viewers, something that concerned Marlon Brando enough to almost turn down the lead role.  But I and II are so good that you will most likely watch them multiple times throughout the years and are smart additions to your collection.	4.0	5 Stars Except for the Deleted Scenes and the Lame Part III	2005-05-30	8	6	2

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AUI9FLOX85Y5C	Josh	The Godfather Trilogy DVD collection is one of the greatest movie pictures in Hollywood history.The Godfather Part 1 was epic film made by Francis Ford Coppola, the screenplay by Coppola and Mario Puzo(author of the book)was perfect. I thought that Al Pacino deserved Best Supporting Actor in this picture. The Godfather Part 2 was a great followup to the first telling two stories, the power of Michael Corleone and the rise of Vito Corleone, Al Pacino definitely deserved Best Actor at the Oscars but he was robbed. The Godfather Part 3 was pretty good not as great as the two previous but still a great story by Coppola and Puzo to end The Godfather.	5.0	The Greatest Mob movies ever made!	2004-01-07	1	1	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AUSLSBIJETVGK	Josiah Webber	These movies are hands down the best movies ever made period. I like a wide variety of movies from all sorts of comedies, old classic movies, to westerns, a very very wide range of different style of horror movies but out of each category and each film that comes out of each category I cant think of a movie that can even begin to compare to it. All three films take you through three generations of life, and you become attached to the characters so easily which makes the films even better. A lot of people think the third installment of this trilogy is not as good as the first two but I'd have to disagree. Pacino's preformance in III was spectacular and the story came to a great but extremily depressing ending. Which makes you think more about the movie and what exactly was going on through Michael's (Pacino's) head. The quality of the dvd I thought was outstanding, but I admit it could have been better but, what are you gunna do? I mean these movies are so great it doesnt matter, they are still cleaned up pretty good, better than a lot of the movies on dvd. As long as its wide screen, it has an excellent picture & sound its good enough for me and this collection deffinately has all of that. As for Part two being put onto two seperate discs, I think that was done so that people, such as my self could sit there for four and a half hours & watch part one & then half of part 2 then take a break before finishing up the rest of the films.

What he doesn't know is that this set can be purchased for an amazingly low price online to which I myself give a big thumbs up. The only complaint that most reviewers have is that the quality of the picture seems to be a bit low considering the new technology available for digital re-mastering.

Sure, the few Brando scenes we get in the first installment are priceless (as if Brando needs to stuff cotton into his mouth to make his speech less understandable than it  already is), and Al Pacino's horrible speech impediment is craftily covered  up by a somewhat contrived &quot;broken jaw&quot;, but Puzo's Godfather  series is nothing more than a soap opera for men.Instead of interviews  with Francis Coppola and the now-dead Puzo at the beginning of the tapes, I  think they should have had commercials for Old Spice and Right Guard.All  in all, the series is part of a growing American genre that glorifies the  terrible acts of bullies. Hey, we love mobsters in America. Kudos to the  now-dead Puzo for delivering this violence to our households in a charming  fashion.In case you think this is a pan, I've seen these movies several  hundred times, and I know almost every line from them.	2.0	A Soap Opera for Men	2000-04-10	25	5	20

Although not a horrible movie when compared to most of the dreck which comes out of Hollywood, Godfather III still fails on several levels and is certainly one of the grossest miscalculations in movie history.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AIFXFHO2N9WJB	"Justice0309 ""Justice"""	"The mafia is a subject matter that has long held sway over the imaginations of both Hollywood and general movie audiences.  Generally every time Hollywood decides to tackle the mob as subject matter for another movie, it's pretty much a guarantee that there will be plenty of money brought in at the box office.  Successful mafia-themed movies are among some of the best films Hollywood has ever produced.  Ranging from Martin Scorcese's classics, ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"", to Sam Mendes' ""Road to Perdition"", and even on TV with HBO's ""The Sopranos"", and Mario Puzo's ""The Last Don"" and ""The Last Don 2"".  But out of all of these movies or TV shows, one trilogy of movies that will forever be regarded as the best of the best in terms of mafia films, and also 3 of the best films ever made would be `The Godfather' trilogy, directed by renowned director Francis Ford Coppola (""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Dracula""), and written by brilliant novelist Mario Puzo.  The following will be a summary of all three films in the trilogy, and then an overall analysis of the trilogy.""The Godfather"" focuses on the fictional Corleone mafia family.  Led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), with his oldest son Sonny (James Caan), middle son Freddo who is running family operations in Las Vegas, and consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the Corleone family struggles to fight its way through the dark world of organized crime.  Set in the years following World War 2, Don Vito Corleone is offered a chance for his family to embark in the drug trade, however, drugs are a vice that Vito believes will lead to the downfall of the mafia.  As Vito declines the opportunity, a decision though smart, will prove to be extremely costly to both him and his family.  As battle lines are drawn between the Corleone's and the other families in New York who feel the Corleone's are causing a rift in their power, all out mafia war is inevitable.  And one thing is for certain no one will escape unscathed.  As the mafia war begins, and casualties begin to pile up not only on the Corleone side of the war, but also on that of the other family's, it is clear that new blood will need to be brought in for victory to be assured.  Though he tried to stay out of his family's dark business, the youngest Corleone son Michael (Al Pacino) must now choose his destiny, to take his rightful place by his father's side or live a life on the right side of the law.  This decision will prove to be the deciding factor in not only the mafia war, but also Michael's happiness in life, but which is more important to him?""The Godfather Part 2"" begins shortly after the climactic ending to the mafia war, as Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is now head of the Corleone family, with one time consigliere turned family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), are now assisting his brother Freddo with operations in Las Vegas.  As Michael continues to run the family business according to his father's last wishes, he is slowly getting the Corleone family into legitimate business and out of the dark mafia underworld.  When a botched assassination attempt is made on Michael's life, he quickly realizes that escaping from this dark life will be more difficult than he thought.  As Michael searches for answers as to who is behind the attempt on his life, he is growing increasingly darker and angrier, causing a rift to form between he and his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton).  Feeling betrayed by his increasingly estranged wife, and fearing that she may not be the only person close to him that is being treacherous, Michael will stop at nothing to maintain his power.  However, this quest along with his family's power may be in jeopardy as the United States government has set their collective sights on bringing down the Corleone family empire.""The Godfather Part 3"" takes place approximately 10 to 20 years after the events of ""The Godfather Part 2"".  Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is still head of the Corleone family, and though he vowed to bring his family into the realm of legitimate business, he is just now in the twilight of his life, succeeding in leaving the dark world of the mafia behind.  Michael in hopes of clearing his family's name in the public realm is becoming more involved in the Catholic Church, however his generosity is not enough to convince his ex-wife Kay (Diane Keaton) or rival mobsters that Michael and the rest of the Corleone family are legitimate.  On the chance that Michael is relinquishing the Corleone family power, another mafia head wants to take the place of the Corleone's power vacuum.  Fearing that this will end badly for the Corleone's, Michael's nephew Vincent (Andy Garcia) convinces Michael to assist him in thwarting this rival family.  Try as he may to escape the life that has consumed him, Michael is drawn back in to the conflict, and this time the consequences of his actions both past and present, may be more than he can possibly bear.`The Godfather' trilogy is a triumphant piece of American cinema, expertly crafted by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola.  Most fans of the movies feel that the first film is the best, with the second movie possibly equal to its greatness, and the third being a disappointment.  Personally, I love the entire trilogy, and feel that they are all equal to each other.  As movies, only the first film can truly stand alone, but I just find the journey of Michael Corleone over the course of the trilogy is so powerful, yet tragic.  No matter how hard he tries to make things right for himself and his family, Michael can never escape the life of a mobster.  The first film we find a young, idealistic Michael untouched by the darkness that plagues his father's life, though it appears that darkness is Michael's destiny.  By the end of ""The Godfather"", Michael has begun to embrace the dark life he has chosen in order to save his family, and in ""The Godfather Part 2"" the darkness has completely consumed Michael.  Everywhere he turns is betrayal and heartbreak, no matter how hard he tries to fight it the darkness within him is consuming all of the great things he once held dear in his life.  ""The Godfather Part 3"" is basically a redemption tale for Michael, as he begins to seek forgiveness and peace of mind from the sins of his past.  Hoping that with redemption will come a chance at a new life filled with the love he had before the darkness consumed him.Anyone who is a fan of mobster movies, and has never seen `The Godfather' trilogy, are doing a serious disservice to himself or herself.  The casting for these films were terrific, from Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando, James Caan, and Diane Keaton, no filmmaker could ask for a more talented cast of actors/actresses.  One of the biggest standout parts of the trilogy occurs in ""The Godfather Part 2"" when Robert De Niro portrays the early days of Vito Corleone as he grows up in the streets of New York to eventually become the head of his own crime family.  De Niro's performance is uncanny when compared to Brando's performance as Don Vito in ""The Godfather""; Francis Ford Coppola's casting of De Niro was perfection.Though, in some ways `The Godfather' trilogy, along with all mafia movies, glorify the life of mobsters, there is no escaping when viewing the entire trilogy and all of the heartbreak that is dealt to almost every character in the films, that this lifestyle is not a wise one to choose.""The Godfather"" is rated R for violence, brief language, and brief nudity/sexuality.""The Godfather Part 2"" is rated R for violence and language.""The Godfather Part 3"" is rated R for violence, language, and brief sensuality."	5.0	An Offer You Can't Refuse...	2006-01-04	11	9	2

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1M6YMW6LS7AJD	Keith	Having seen the movies previously, I found the bonus pack the most interesting.  It reveals the uncertain climate that existing during the production of the Part 1, plus lots of other good stuff.Although I had last seen Part 1 about 15 years ago, it was clear to me that some scenes are missing.  I was hoping the movies would be full length, but Part 1 certainly isn't.  For example, the murder of Pauli is abreviated somewhat, and Tom's visit to Woltz seems to be cut too.That aside, I thorougly enjoyed all three movies and the bonus CD.  The sound is as good as one might expect given the poduction period and the picture is excellent.  There was some issue with the contrast in a section of Part 2, but that could have been deliberate.	5.0	I loved it.	2001-10-09	3	2	1

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1VZLLDNLURGJB	Keith Mirenberg	"This was a great collection on Blu-Ray and was worth every penny!  My review is just to say that the Blu-Ray restoration played very well and was significantly clearer than the original DVD presentation (which I own). It plays very nicely on a 52"" HDTV and even better on smaller HDTV screens. If you love these three films you can buy this restoration version with no reservations about the picture quality.The box set contains numerous interesting specials on the making of the Godfather series as well as footage which had to be removed to reduce the playing time. All this footage is now available with this collection with a description of why each scene was shot, why it was removed and what its place was in the story line. This footage is not in high definition but still very interesting. Many other interesting special features included."	5.0	Loved It!	2010-08-13	2	1	1
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AWXBY70IZVIML	"Keith Paynter ""videoplusdvd"""	"For those crying for the ""Godfather Saga""/""Godfather Epic"" versions, you are missing the point.  Restoration expert Robert Harris (and countless others) worked for over a year from the best available print materials (as the original negatives are badly damaged and faded) to restore the first and second films to their original theatrical glory, which is something these iconic films of American Cinema deserve.  That is the point of restoration.If you are looking for a ""wow"" disc to show off your Blu-ray home theater sound and video, this is not it.  If you are looking to experience modern American Gangster cinema in its 1970's glory, this is as close as you are ever likely to get, muted sepia-esque color, film grain and all.These were not done exclusively for the home market.  The priority was that they were restored for theatres, because that is where they would be judged the most critically, and all indications are that they do not disappoint.  Never watch these films in your living room with the lights on.  Watch them like you do in the theater, lights out, to appreciate the effort that went into these films."	5.0	A faithful restoration of the originals	2008-09-22	466	438	28

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2QWCEXT5QFC9C	Kelly Christensen	There is no argument that the Godfather films are important to cinema, whether you like them or not. However, the soon to be released Godfather box set editions on DVD are flawed. They have been slapped with those ugly little black bars on the top and bottom of the screen to create a 1.35:1 aspect ratio when they were originally shot and theatrically presented full frame.  Why release part one and two wide screen when they were shot at a full frame aspect ratio?  Before you buy this DVD, consider the fact you will be losing picture with this wide screen edition. The DVD distributor is actually throwing black bars over the picture!  This first came to my attention in the documentary  &quot;Visions of light&quot; where all films discussed were shown in their original aspect ratio. In that film, The Godfather I &amp; II were shown full frame. I compared the two versions myself after it was released a few years back on VHS in a wide screen edition.  I did a side by side of several scenes and sure enough, picture was taken away to create the effect of a wide screen aspect ratio for the letterboxed edition. In a time where letterboxing is becoming more acceptable in home viewing and audiences are becoming savvier on aspect ratios, I feel that this is very deceitful. For me, the original, full frame presentation of these films adds a layer of realism that enhances the subconscience perception of this film. Think of the senate hearing scenes in part II having a letter box effect. That was a very real scene. While you watch that scene you forget you are watching actors in a movie.  The letterbox effect in that scene will always remind you that what you are watching is not real, it is a movie. It just looses its effectiveness. I do not know who is responsible for the masking of this film. Whether it was the studio, the distributor or the director himself for the purpose of marketing, I urge you to reconsider purchasing this DVD and hold out for the full screen editions however long it may take.	4.0	Flawed DVD Release	2001-06-20	5	2	3
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1XJ2XSG4W96K8	Kelsey	"I know this series is in high regard for being the greatest gangster film of all-time, so I decided to check it out myself. Originally it was WAY too long for me to even want to see, but I was curious so one afternoon I sat through all of these films. That's 8 hours I'll never get back! I could've been doing something productive like playing World Of Warcraft instead. The films dragged on WAY too long and overstayed their welcome by about an hour each. There wasn't enough violence to make this a worthwhile gangster flick. Also, it was annoying when they spoke in Italian. They should've dubbed the voices instead. No one wants to read subtitles! How inconvenient. Finally, I'm giving this 2 stars because the third one was the only watchable one. Sequels made 20 years later are the bomb!See the new Johnny Depp movie ""Public Enemies"" or ""Get Carter"", ""Be Cool"" or ""Dick Tracy"" for real gangster films!"	2.0	The Boringfather is moar liek it.

Now thats out of the way these DVD's are outstanding.  The audio quality far surpasses that of the VHS.  And I'm going to buy a widescreen tv just so I can see it in widescreen.Brando was amazing as the godfather.  But Micheal was more rutless.  These movies tell a tale of a large italian crime family and there ups and downs living in the US.  This includes ""Hits"", Gambeling rings, prostitution, and extortion.  Although brando never appears in 2 his presence is felt in the end scene.  If I could recommend two movies that everyone should see it would be the first two godfathers.In conclusion this movie is full of action and drama from beginning to end.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1OAMVTMZLBCJQ	ken yong	If you're a Godfather virgin (and thank the gods!), quit reading other reviews and at least rent the movies (or very least, part I on VHS). Despite the fact the gore and violence here isn't as gut-nauteous as Final Destination II (but very intriguing) and seemed snail-paced like your grandad's opera records, the clever plot-twists, slick direction and monumental acting will reward the best three hours of your lives (or six, or even hell, almost-impossible, nine).Part I gets you intrigued with the greatest mafia figure in film, Vito Corleone (&quot;I'm gonna make an offer he can't refuse&quot;) with such wisdom  and fatherly authoratian that you will regard him like a real godfather instead of a mafia head. &quot;Sonny&quot; Santino Corleone, the eldest son who is so temperental, brash and a terrible contrast of his father that you may wonder how the world will turn if he takes over Vito Corleone as the Don. Fredo Corleone is reputed to be the weakest in the family, but you must watch Godfather Part II to know further more. Al Pacino's career launched as the legendary Micheal Corleone who doesn't want to follow his father's footsteps, yet he assumes his father's position later on and became a figure that never knew would become; a colder figure than his father. Part II goes back to the roots of the Corleone family; the rise of Vito Andolini from his humble beginnings after running away from a Mafia head who wiped out his whole family. Also side-by-side with this &quot;prologue&quot; is Micheal Corleone continuing to running the family, with his paranoia of betrayals tightening his Machiavellian approach. Part III is reputed to be flop and some Godfather fanatics even recommended complete exile from Part III, yet it is just as good as &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; for Star Wars. Despite some pretty superficial acting by Coppola's daughter in potrayal of Mary Corleone, Al Pacino as the aging Don Micheal will touch your hearts at the very least and he saved the movie from being a total disaster because of dissapointing casts (where is Robert Duvall and why is elderly Tom Hagen silent throughout the movie?). Furthermore, the story is still commendable despite parallels with Part I.There are some pretty personal complaints. Part II, despite the classic usual Al Pacino's performance as Micheal, feels a bit of a let down. That is because storywise, Part III is more intriguing and Vito Corleone's story lacks creativity and is downright predictable. I also had to watch the movie some three times because the plot in Micheal's story is somewhat confusing (yet still had clever plot twists). However it will be an abomination if similar dissapointment is expressed in superb casting and the terrific debutant Robert De Niro as young Vito. De Niro really mirrors Marlon Brando's elderly Vito, from the voice, characteristics to the some parallels to Brando's &quot;Cleenex&quot; cheeks! The picture quality is dissapointing, some images are downright murky and some scenes are too dark to view anything. Also, the lacking of chronological order of &quot;The Godfather Saga&quot; and my biggest complaint; overzealous reviewers spoiling the movie by revaling crucial plot-twists and even endings. Yet all of these are minor and please watch, even though you grew up being fed by Titanic, Matrix, or even Jackie Chan movies.	5.0	The minimal-spoiler review.	2003-03-05	9	4	5

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AGKPTMTR3UX1R	"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here"""	"I've reviewed the three GODFATHER films in depth elsewhere on Amazon.com, so I am going to limit this review to the merely technical aspects of ""The Coppolla Restoration.""First of all, it's important to watch the two ""Extras"" discs first, as they provide a lot of information about the restoration process, particularly the short named ""Emulsional Rescue.""THE GODFATHER's original master negative was created on particularly ""thin"" photo stock, meaning that fewer top quality prints could be created from it. Ironically, THE GODFATHER ended up having a vast number of prints made from this thin stock. The quality of these prints deteriorated fast---much faster than with an average movie made on standard stock.The master negative was in such poor shape when the restoration team began working that they inadvertently destroyed about thirty feet of it trying to save it. This meant that the restoration team had to find the best quality prints from all around the world and laboriously splice them together, often individual frame by frame, to reconstruct what they called their ""hero"" negative from which the restoration was made.As a result, the restoration is not as good as a pristine master negative would be, even a ""restored"" one. This is as good as it will ever be, barring some new as-yet unimagined process.Many reviewers have commented on the ""poor"" color quality of the restoration. I was fascinated (and a little befuddled) to discover that the ""tangerine hell"" one reviewer described in certain color scenes was intentional on the part of the cinematographer, as was the darkness of much of the film---there are scenes in which the blackness is so utterly black that it swallows the set.No, we're not losing our eyesight.I missed the point, too, until I thought it through. It makes a certain ""artsy-fartsy"" sense when the viewer recognizes that The Godfather lives in hell. Evil is pure darkness, and joy (such as Connie's wedding) is lit by fiery reds and golds---literally a ""tangerine hell.""For a more intense example, look at the Sollozzo murder scene: Just before the shootings Michael is dark, while the out-of-focus red neon light on the Louis' Family Restaurant sign burns brightly over his right shoulder. That this is not bad filmmaking can be seen in the fact that less crucial scenes (such as the Don's funeral scene) have no such color distortion. It's subtle, and it is artsy, but mute the color extremes and THE GODFATHER would probably lose much of its visual impact.On a more normative note, the restoration brings out a hundred little details: A sign announcing Jake LaMotta's defense of his title pops out of nowhere, presagingRaging Bull; the appearance of oranges (always a harbinger of death in THE GODFATHER films) is more obvious; the dissolution evident on the face of the Black Hand extortionist Fanucci is highlighted; the sepia-tint quality of the early Twentieth Century DeNiro scenes in GODFATHER PART TWO is emphasized; and the intricacy of the sets is evident everywhere.Fortunately, THE COPPOLLA RESTORATION is just that, a restoration, and Francis Ford Coppolla does not do what he has done before, re-edit, add, subtract, and meld these movies together. This is a purely ""technical"" restoration of the films (or at leastThe GodfatherandThe Godfather Part II; the less-worthyGodfather Part IIIgets no such treatment).THE GODFATHER becomes more enjoyable as a result of the restoration, though you may not be consciously aware of the changes at first."	4.0	"""The Godfather"" reclaimed"	2009-06-22	13	13	0

Never has there been or perhaps will be such storytelling combined with such cinematic genius. Sadly enough, it paints  the picture of a world increasingly unfamiliar to our own -- and by that I  don't refer to the New York mobster world, this movie is not about shoot'em  up gangsters.  Its about a world where family is of the highest value,  where the mistakes we make we pay for in full, where nothing is glorified  and idealized, but seen for what they are.  Its brutally honest, full of  timeless wisdom, and the most wonderful film ever produced.	5.0	Personal Favorite	2000-02-04	2	1	1

This movie is almost completely aloof from criticism.  When  people do speak badly of it, the say it glorifies violence and organized  crime.  This is not true.  It really shows the bad side of organized crime.  In the end, Michael Corleone faces many losses because of organized crime.  His wife leaves him, his daughter is killed, he orders the killing of his  brother and brother in law, his nephews are left fatherless because of him.  In the end, he dies all alone by himself.  He has lost everyone and  everything he ever really cared about.  So instead of a saga glorifying  violence and the mafia, it is really a tragedy showing the ill effects of  the mafia.	5.0	Downplay on Violence	2000-08-08	3	1	2
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3VY6T3HYARQK3	"Ladd Wendelin ""laddman@hotmail.com"""	The epic saga so common throughout history, told in the stories of Homer, Dante, etc. transcends our own times, or any time for that matter that it would seem to be hard to measure up to the gradiosity and eloquence of the well-told tale, the epic saga, especially in our post-Palm Pilot, Sopranos, cell phone society.That was until Mario Puzo sat down to create the beginnings, the framework, the characters, the story, the modern epic that we now know as THE GODFATHER. Francis Ford Coppola would use that book as the spark that started the fire that is now The Godfather I, II, and III.We can all agree that The Godfather is a staple, and a veritable classic of the American cinema. With the release of the complete trilogy on DVD, Godfather fans of the past and present, and future can look at the big picture, the modern epic story of the Coreleone Family in all its fully realized glory, not to mention in blazing THX picture and sound for superior quality!I've already preordered the Trilogy on DVD and can't wait to see it.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2F3HLHRHQMR6O	larry	"GODFATHER PART 1: The one that started it all. I can never decide which film I like better, the first or the second. At the end of the day, I decide that they're both great films and leave it at that. Here's the introduction to the world of the Corleone's and everything is just right. The actors are all in tune to their characters. The directing is top-notch, with many of the smaller details pulling us further into this world. The score is one of the best musical movie pieces of all-time, one that will always bring you back to this film, whenever it is heard. The pace is ideal, with three hours flying by like nothing, but most importantly, it's the story of these people that is absolutely fascinating and a pleasure to watch. Brando brooding over his disciples. Pacino deciding on what he should do with his life. Caan, the passionate brother who has anger hanging off the tip of his tongue. Cazale, the sap brother, who just wants to impress others and feel accepted. Everyone shines in this movie and takes it to the level of film that it is: an instant classic. See it and appreciate what a good movie can do to you. It can make you feel, it can make you cry, it can make you wince and above all...it can entertain you. And how about that final shot of Kay (Diane Keaton) looking into the room? Yipes...like I said...classic *****GODFATHER PART 2:  This film is yet another classic of American Cinema. Not only was Francis Ford Coppola able to re-connect the audience with the well-developed characters that he introduced us to in the first film, but he also takes it one step further, and gives us even more background on the man behind the entire family, Vito Corleone, but as a child first entering the country. And that is the secret of this second movie. There are two stories happening here, and they are told in parallel. On the one hand, we have Robert DeNiro, presenting us with the palpable sadness of Vito Corleone's early years in New York with his wife and kids. And on the other hand, we have Michael Corleone (Al Pacino, playing Vito's son all grown up and continuing where he left off in the first film), taking his empire to another level. The rise of the two men captures your attention once again in this amazing movie, filled with many graphic and memorable moments, all of which pull you further into its epic ambitions. I've always loved this movie as much as the first, and the truth is that they are just perfect together. This film completes the first movie, fills in some holes and gives you further insight into the loves, hates, passions and lives of these people. Once again, the performances are all top-notch here, with DeNiro winning an Oscar, despite saying very few English words during the entire movie. An impressive film that was able to balance two stories at the same time while keeping you entertained and engaged throughout. Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola and to everyone involved in the creation of this amazing sequel *****GODFATHER PART 3: This movie wasn't as bad as I remembered it. In fact, I think it's because its predecessors were so great, that it really feels worse than it is. It's actually pretty good. There were however, certain things that ""got to me"" about this flick, most of which had to do with the acting. I didn't much care for Joe Mantegna in this movie. Not necessarily his character, but his acting, which I thought was a little over-the-top. I also thought the same of the chain-smoking priest, who I never really bought into. Sofia Coppola wasn't necessarily bad as her character was just ""boring"". I didn't really understand how a cool stud like Andy Garcia would go for a girl like that. And the fact that Duvall was nixed here, was a disgrace, in my opinion (and you replace him with George Hamilton, of all people?!?). Anyway, those are all small pet peeves of mine, I suppose. Overall, I did like the story, and even though the whole Vatican thing seemed a little far-fetched (although it turns out that it was actually based on a true story), I was still quite riveted by the film, mostly because I liked all of the characters, and it was nice to see what had happened to them all, after all of these years. Very nostalgic and cozy. But what really made this movie for me was the amazing performance put forth by Andy Garcia. Wow! This dude torched some massive fire into this movie, and it was just what it needed. I was also glued to my set during the film's final 30 minutes, which Coppola has turned into amazing sequences in all three films, and seriously appreciated the thrilling moments within. And how about those two twin bodyguards!? Mingya! And most surprising of all, was the before last scene featuring the whole family coming out of the opera house, in which Coppola used silence to accentuate Michael's pain, and dude, it had me gulping with the missus, like you wouldn't believe. Very powerful, very sad and very touching, all at the same time. The final shot in the film is also another classic and a fitting way to finish the tale of a man who lost sight of what was most important to him over the years: love and family ****"	5.0	there is no reason in the world why you should not have this	2002-03-29	4	3	1

I'm shocked there would be such little attention to the visual transfer. The audio is fine but I didn't find any of the deleted scenes mentioned making this a forgettable collection. The Sopranos does a far better job. Rent the DVD version prior to buying if you're serious about spending this kind of money, and get a heads up about what to expect.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1M4AO3J7U1B5P	Leslie Winterburn	"This trilogy on Blu-Ray left me with the opinion that the first chapter was the best but I was looking forward to seeing Robert De Niro in the second and I was impressed with his portrayal of the younger Marlon Brando in his role as Vito Corleone. Now I understand why these guys get paid so much. He even sounded like Marlon Brando let alone take on his mannerisms that he (Brando) had adopted for the part. Al Pacino did a sterling job as the linch-pin in all three movies and held the trilogy together in continuity terms at the very least but essentially gave the whole story some meaning in his role as the reluctant but necessary member of the ""Famiglia"" that tried to go legitimate.As for this Restoration Edition the work that the studio did to clean up the thirty-five year old picture was nothing short of incredible. The transfer is so clean and precise that at times some of the outdoor scenes took on a three dimensional image and I don't think I have ever seen so many different shades of BLACK in a movie before. Overall this is a very dark movie (and I don't just mean its theme) and the Blu-Ray just brought it all out into sharp focus as I'm sure F.F.Coppola was aiming for in this beautiful restoration. Well Done all involved and a treasure to own. My votes were; Chapter 1, 9/10 EXCELLENT. Chapter 2, 8/10 OUTSTANDING.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	ALI3SPPYP6JYP	Liam O'Malley	The Godfather trilogy, the greatest gangster movies ever made without a shadow of a doubt.  The Performances from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Talia Shire, Robert Duvall and not forgetting the fantastic performance of Fredo by John Cazale along with James Caan's performance as the passionate but violent Santino are the best they have ever produced.  The first two movies are arguably two of the greatest movies ever produced and even though the third Godfather film took a grilling from the critics I feel it is a movie that shows Michael Corleone in his true light as an ordinary man who is searching for peace in his life and redmption for his mistakes.  The scene where he confesses all to Cardinal Lamberto is truly touching and the standard of acting produced by Pacino to show his grief at the loss of his daughter towards the end of the film is the greatest moment of cinematic acting ever produced.......	5.0	A search for redemption	2001-04-24	0	0	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A37TJJU91MWHD9	Lifes2good	Warning - If your DVD player was manufactured before these discs were produced then it is probable that you will need a firmware and/or software upgrade to your DVD player to utilize all the features of this product.  This cautionary statement is printed just inside the front cover of the case containing the disks.  I wish I had known this before ordering.  It all sounded so good with so many 5 star reviews that I just plunged in and bought it.  Fortunately I was able to return the DVDs for a refund.  I give Amazon 5 stars for that.I will either have to upgrade my DVD player (not likely) or purchase a different version of these great movies.  Incidentally, the DVDs did play but the quality was nothing to brag about.  Maybe that's only because I need to upgrade.  I'll never know.  The problem with the DVDs was that some menu functions were inaccessible or non-working and some functions operated from buttons on the remote labeled for an entirely different function.  At one point the DVD player froze up and only by unplugging it from the power outlet was I able to turn it off.  So buyer beware.	1.0	Caution to owners of older DVD blu-ray players.	2013-07-30	12	5	7

Numerous movies, TV shows, books and other media openly credit the Godfather as being their inspiration. One of the currently most popular TV series, The Sopranos, often directly quotes the Godfather. This DVD set is the best way to see the entire series, plus NUMEROUS special features, in a way that is as high-quality as possible, without all of the inherent flaws of tape.I *love* this series. So many reviews here have acclaimed these movies that their merits don't really need to be listed again in detail. Incredible acting. Fantastic music. Brilliant directing. Sure, there are a few flaws. We're all human. But this is a movie series that is taught in many colleges, and there's a reason for it. It's GOOD. Be sure to get a copy for yourself, so you can enjoy it for yourself. Cook up a pan of lasagne and invite some friends over!

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3T8T2EFK1HVGB	LivingNaples	The movie is 5 star. But I am rating the Blu Ray version, not the movie itself. Unless there is something wrong with my Blu Ray copy, then the God Father Blu Ray is not worth the money. Unlike other Blu Ray movies, where there is a significant noticeable difference in the quality of the Blu Ray version vs. non Blu Ray, I perceived no difference.I am not saying that if you had both a Blu Ray and non Blu Ray version of the Godfather running side by side, that you would not be able to see a difference. Just that with other Blu Ray movies, the difference to me has always been clear with a Wow factor. No Wow with the Godfather Blu Ray.I haven't watch Part II of the set, maybe it has improved quality.Not worth the money for the package.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2WSIQA0LMV6MX	Lou1972	Yes, to have all three movies restored for Blu-ray release is fantastic, but die-hard Godfather fans are longing for a chronological release with ALL the extra scenes found in the Saga (1977), Epic (1981) and Trilogy (1992). There are so many enjoyable and important scenes left out of the original movies. The scenes of Sonny taking control after the Don is shot is invaluable. After Connie's wedding, the Don & his sons visit the dying Genco in the hospital. The scene in Part II of Don Fanucci singing a Sicilian song and later trying to fix up Vito with one of his daughters. There are too many to mention here, but having the movies in chronological order with all the deleted scenes would the ultimate Godfather collection.

Although, one thing I am dissapointed in with the movie--certain scenes within the movies, in which the Don would speak in his darkened decision making office are extremely dark.  One can barely make out the Don much less the setting.  One would think with all the technology available today, those parts of the movie would be alot clearer.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1L22J6TIKQGOH	loveinthemist	I bought this with idea on heavy snow or storm weather which can knock out our service to watch TV that this would be a good back up. One my husband would enjoy as I am always hearing how men quote lines from it.  lol!Well though my husband does enjoy Robert De Niro and Al Pacino movies generally very much, this happens to not be one of his more favorites! Shock to me!!I could swore about 15 years ago when it came out he just loved it!! But as he says compared to Raging Bull or Scent of Woman he rather enjoy those but this is very enjoyable movie just he like others bit more. You just cannot win trying to do something nice for your spouse at times!I still think though, once it is on, he will again be mesmerized with wonderful acting and mob way of killing people as if it has no damage on one's souls...or as my husband say it really does not on some. I choose to believe eventually near end of one's life they do have regrets.i know he love the scenes at Tahoe though i caught that they were filming it from different areas of the lake having grown up and realize exactly where the main party scene is held. I love looking at Mt Tallac across the lake...but than it is not lol! as i we climbed it numerous times for easy jaunt on slow day.I do think this is such a well written and directed movie that one both men and women will enjoy. I just did not like the horse head and keep saying to myself it is a fake...how could someone do that to such a beautiful creature?I wish that Sonny had not become the man he did and regrets it ...is it destroying of his soul or that period? Both?Al Pacino should i wish could do or get some better roles or move forward to different style as De Niro and Nicholson has gone to do so well in lighter romantic comedies. Where both female and male leading stars are aged, not so great bodies but with just a look, a touch, a lifetime of knowing what real love passes out to the audience.I wish Pacino who started this in Scent of Woman had continued do make few others as he was so wonderful and realistic in both tired of painful lonely life and finding life again right at last moment.So of course this is great movie....just not as great as i hoped my husband would have thought it be on fowl weather day with us home alone.  Maybe says something about each of us?	4.0	for bad snowy day when signals are out	2014-03-25	0	0	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1MLYIYO9O609F	"L. Rowe ""L. Rowe"""	"Where do I begin about this movie? Over-rated like Scarface, just like goodfellas. This is a trend now with these mafia movies. Again, I bought this out of curiousity to see what was all the hype of this so-called ""greatest"" movie of all time, next to Scarface, and yet, again, I was disappointed. Now, the movie was OKAY, nothing more and nothing less. It's certainly not all that. Some of the storylines were interesting like Michael Corleone and his rise to rule the family, and all the betrayals and backstabbings. A lot of it, however, was rather dry and boring. I can understand why people don't like part 3 of the trilogy. In part 2, I thought that Micheal forgave his brother, Fredo, for his betrayal, so when I watched the last series and happened that Micheal had him killed then I did not quite get that. I thought that he should have forgiven him since he was still his brother regardless. Then his daughter falling in love with her cousin, Vincent, his nephew was really disgusting and repulsing. Seriously, the only really good mafia movie is the Last Don. That movie really rocks! The first part is over 4 hours and last part is close to 3 hours, and never once did my brother or I get bored because the movie was so good. Great acting, good plot, interesting characters, good storyline, every bit was good. The Last Don should be on the list as the best mafia movies, not this garbage, though it's by the same writer. I know people will get mad at me for saying this. I don't see why people should take this so seriously...it's only my view. I realize that I am in a minority when saying it's over-rated, but please, let's not be so hostile and angry.

The action and plotting are so wonderful that we're swiftly moved along in early viewings, but in subsequent viewings, there's so much more to be noticed and savored--tiny details (the motif of oranges, the pills that Micheal swallows on the train to see Hyman Roth) and passing lines of dialogue that inform and astound. The elements are so finely wrought, the characters so intelligently drawn, the drama so finely balanced (operatic without being melodramatic) these films are pure pleasure and pure art.	5.0	Masterpieces	2007-07-29	3	3	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A133SST6AIU36Y	"""malefic-prophet"""	"Forget the too long movie about Jesus and his disciples, the Corleone legacy is the truly the greatest story ever told. Francis Ford Coppola, also well known for Apocalypse Now and other epics, transferred Mario Puzo's novels to absolute perfection. And now the best movies in the world are in a special edition DVD set, all three of them to watch to your discretion. The Godfather movies are really a guys dream movie, you have the Mafia, the family oriented theme, the action, the blood, the guns, the ... well everything. The Godfather spawned quotes that we still use today from classics like ""Keep your friends close and your enemies closer."" to.. ""I know Fredo, you broke my heart. You broke my heart."" and the immortal ""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.""What was it about these epic classics that made us love the Corleone family so much? I think a lot of it had to do with their code of honor, something they followed like law, though they broke the laws of the land. It was a movie about the Mafia, a sort of inside look (though fictional) of how these Mafia families ruled their territories and the betrayal that stemmed from greed and envy. The Godfather was an epic because of Marlon Brando's immortal portrayal of the tough but family oriented Vito Corleone. A star studded cast including, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire, James Caan and others you have seen in tons of different movies. Vito Corleone was a man of respect, the head of the most powerful family in New York, a tough business man that would go to the ends for his family. The people around him respected him and loved him.In the Godfather Part II, we see Vito's heir to the Corleone family, his youngest son Michael, become the most ruthless seen in cinema history. (Maybe matched with Al Pacino's other crime boss portrayal of Scarface.) Michael was a brutal and darker Don then his father, Vito. Michael will be immortalized in film by showing how dangerous he could be and how ruthless he could act. As the ending of the film proved, no one would stand in the way of the Corleone family, and even family would pay for betraying their own. The performance given by John Cazale as the weak Fredo Corleone was great. As was Diane Keaton's returning role as Kay, Michael's estranged wife. And perhaps the best part of the second installment of the Godfather Legacy was Robert De Niro's role as a young Vito Corleone, showing how the family business began through a series of flashbacks. Robert Duvall returning as Tom Hagan, the families lawyer and ex-consiglieri to Vito Corleone. And a great scene featuring the return of James Caan as Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone for the final scene in the film, set on Vito's birthday as Michael explains that he quit college and joined the Marines to fight in World War II. Sadly, Marlon Brando had not come back to reprise his role of Vito.Part III was probably the slowest of the three films. And a lot of old characters were missing, such as Robert Duvall as Tom Hagan as well as many  of the allies of the Corleone family. Andy Garcia comes in as a new face, the bastard son of Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone. Most of the movie is a long twisting tale of betrayal and struggle, with Michael Corleone trying to get the family legit. More of a soap opera then the first two epics, it was still a nice finish to the saga of Michael Corleone. It wrapped up most of the loose ends and you didn't feel cheated. Though it lacked the feeling the first two movies had, it had a great quality, due in a good part by the fact that it was filmed in 1990. But on DVD we don't even have to worry about that.The Special Edition DVD Box Set is probably the favorites in my collection. The Godfather movies made a big impact on me, even though I wasn't even born when the first two were made and only 8 when Part III came out. I watched them because my father always talked about the great Godfather movies and I had to watch them. It quickly became my favorite movie series of all time. The DVD set has tons upon tons of special features with a bonus disc dedicated to do just that. The picture and sound quality is excellent.5 out of 5. If you or anyone in you family loves Mafia movies and owns a DVD player, this is a gift they can never refuse.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A13WK0568LZNL0	"Mark Coffey ""austindeadhead"""	"Any discussion of great American cinema necessarily includes ""The Godfather"".  Remarkably, that same claim applies as well to ""The Godfather, Part II""; and if Part III fails to reach the same lofty heights, it's still a must-see, if only to see how the story ends (I didn't necessarily need to OWN Part III, though).  Although Marlon Brando's historic performance will always brand him the Godfather, these movies are really about Al Pacino's Michael. In the early scenes, Michael stands aloof, neither condemning or praising his family's business, but accepting it for what it is, and knowing that for him there will be another way.  Yet the wounding of Don Vito reveals something that had never occurred to Michael.  He is the only one with the strength to carry on the family - Sonny's a hothead, Fredo's weak, and Tom - well, Tom is strong, but he lacks the iron will and has other important duties to take care of.  Coppola sets all this up perfectly - you can see the metamorphosis (of course, Pacino deserves no end of credit as well) unfold before your eyes.  Then there is the matter of Robert De Niro as the young Vito - a truly masterful performance revolving more around body language, gestures, and attitudes than words (one of the bonus features is a screen test by De Niro for Michael at the wedding - great stuff!).  The rest of the saga revolves around Michael's masterful consolidation of power, and his spiritual torment at the way he amassed it.  The weaknesses of part III are real:  they are primarily poor casting, and a script that was made up on the fly.  Still, had Coppola left the third part out, the whole thing would have been less complete.  The bonus materials are fine, but that's not why you need this collection - the films themselves are treasures all their own."	5.0	Coppola's Mafia Classic Available at Last	2001-10-25	2	1	1

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3NKKA4G3QNV0X	Mark Frederick	"I have never cared for the Godfather. I think it really goes nowhere. I can remember going to the Ocean one year (25 years ago) with some guys, and one guy loved this film, and is Italian. I can remember getting up and saying ""What the hell is this?"" I think this, and the whole 70's gritty, violent, New York thing is annoying. With some exceptions, see below. And I don't mind gritty. It can be quite good/excellent. But not this.Brando after On The Waterfront was way overrated. I find that after Streetcar, and on the Waterfront he almost appeared to sulk through his films. But many folks seem to think otherwise. Fine. I don't agree. I like Pacino, but think he is also overrated. And Justice For All, or Serpico are his best films, and really showcase his ability, and are excellent films. Maybe The Panic In Needle Park, but I don't think it's as good as the other two I just mentioned. And The Devils Advocate is always fun. But many of his films are way overated, as is his acting. I would say Duval is underrated. Can we say Network, just to name a few? See where I am going. I want a movie to mean something if it's great. And this just doesn't.I find this violent soap opera film annoying, and nothing redeeming about any of it's characters. Give me the classics. Film Noir. Something that really does have an edge without the soap opera nonsense. Or the films I mentioned from above, along with some other great films of the 70's that if you look them up on here you will be lucky to find 15 reviews on many of them."	2.0	Overrated	2010-08-09	11	1	10

I was hoping to see some additional footage not in the video  versions, but scenes that we have seen when the movies are being played on cable tv. The was the reason for the 4 stars. I like the DVD collection better than video for the mere fact that I dont have to get up and change the tapes, except for the GODFATHER 2 here. In my opinion that makes the movies easier to watch and enjoy. If you love the Godfater Trilogy, I dont think that this set will disappoint you.

I have a 46"" Samsung flat screen and a high quality surround sound system and I was absolutely blown away. Is it dark? It most certainly is...but the original producers/directors meant it to be. If you watch the extra on DVD #4 ""Emulsional Rescue Revealing The Godfather HD"", you will understand why everything is dark. My father remembered seeing this in the theatre in 1974 and said these scenes were as good/better than he remembers.Order this and watch it...you won't be sorry.

The Godfather films [yes, including Part III] are in a class with Euripides, Shakespeare, Goethe...Regarding the DVD collection, the films look and sound remarkable.  The chapters are well divided, the menus are elegant and usable, the 4th [extra material] disc is indispensable.  What struck me as fascinating was how integral last minute script rewrites factored into these films.  One would think that every detail had been agonized over, every symbol considered and weighed.  Not so, many details were accidents or capricious anomalies that came together at the last moment.  For instance, in Part II, it's interesting to note that Brando was supposed to appear as the elder Vito just prior to Michael joining the army in WWII [when not flashing back to Deniro as Vito or forward to Michael's reign] but literally didn't show up to the filming, so the scene was rewritten to have Vito off-camera.  This type of thing always seemed so purposeful, but rather, is an example of how great creative endeavors tend to develop a life and mind of their own.I really enjoyed the genealogical tree that showed all the birth/death dates of the Corleone family.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3KS6VNNXICDT2	Maximus	This is an all time great. Marlon Brando shoews us what true acting is by inventing lines that never existed, or atleasst he acted themas though they never existed. Al Pacino fits into the role very nicely. He is sweet and kind and loving. But when he takes over from his father's positoin, he becomes mercilesslly ruthless. James Caan , the big brother , too fitted into his role nicely, his bossy attitude adn luck with the women. Fredo was'nt much of a character in this movie, he acted in very few scenes. Tom Hagen, Robert Duvall has always been a class actor. He gave a good performance, but I'd have to say that I've seen a few better.All in all though, this film is one of the best I've ever seen. It has everything.IT's a class film.	5.0	That I cannot do	2002-05-05	3	1	2

Daneker	This crappy duplication of the original stock contains scratches, nicks, color washout and flickering, all problems that can be solved by frame by frame digitizing and restoration. They opted not to do one damn thing to create the lush, rich, colorful and remarkably sharp DVD experience, instead the quality is that of a brand new VHS on a good machine. As for sound, no DTS and the surround is nearly pointles, the shots of cars driving, rain, gun fights have no spatial or 3D sense. For nearly $25.00 per film we deserve more. Don't let hte fancy packaging fool you, after seeing what they can do with Star Wars or The Evil Dead I expected at least as much from this, at least the light flickering to be gone. I am gravely disapointed as I love these films.Five Star Films, 1 Star DVD's.For a year I yearned for the $69.99 box set. Finally, my birthday comes and my wife hands it to me. I have watched the faded VHS version for 15 years, I can't wait for this.I put in film one, play, I sit back, relax, my jaw drops.The logo is flickering. The light flickers that come from direct film transfer, the same ones on the VHS, that can be easily removed by digitizing. They're still there.The Color is washed out, the shading uneven, the picture quality wavers from sharp to soft, from high contrast to pastel colors.The surround sound does nothing. The scene where Sonny is shot to death  by a circle of Tommy Guns doesn't come from all corners of the room. The sub woofer is nearly flaccid.There are scratches in the film, nicks and pings.What is this? Why didn't they restore these masterpieces?I watch Indian Jones, Star Wars, even Mary Poppins!!!

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2DS74QYYAZF37	"M. Garcia ""pitbullmedia"""	"I have to admit, having read some reviews here and elsewhere, I half expected the Coppola Restoration to be an ugly mess.  However, I decided to try it because the extras were so enticing.  I'm glad I did.  The results are great.  The complaints about dirt and color that I have seen are exaggerated and inaccurate.  Some people just have no idea how to adjust a tv.  Yes, there are a couple of spots in the first film that show a speck of dust or two, one big bit of debris in the middle for a moment, along with a few headlights and a lamp that look a tiny bit too bright - not a big tally considering this movie was released in 1972, and hasn't been seen in it's true glory since then.  I also saw some complaints about the picture and sound for Part 3.  Don't believe them.  It should be noted that Part Three is not really part of the ""restoration"" however.  It is simply included for completeness.  So, if you saw the previous dvd of Part 3, it will look the same here.The extras are very good - better than most dvd junk extras.  A little self-congratulatory, but I figure the Godfather has earned the right to pat itself on the back.  The extra scenes are great if you've never seen them before.  They are far from essential, but satisfying for the completist.  Especially (SPOILER ALERT) a scene that ties up Apollonia's murder, Tom's return from his abduction which shows that he is, indeed, loved as a brother, and a bit more on the Consiglieri that Tom is supposed to replace.Bottom line is, if you don't care about extras, and you own an older version that you like, this set is unnecessary.  But if you have interest in the extras, or always felt the older release looked dull and faded, this is the thing that will scratch your itch."	5.0	An Offer I'm Glad I Didn't Refuse!	2010-10-18	1	1	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3TUQYL9LWXQAK	M. Heller	Upon purusing the various five star reviews, my four out of five star rating my stick out to you like a sore thumb.  Well, I did this for two reasons:1)The Bonus features, while nice, are missing one essential element: the actors' thoughts.  You hear a lot of stuff from director Francis Ford Coppola.  But also, you hear way too much stuff from the producer, Mario Puzzo, etc.  These guys say way too much.  Francis Ford Coppola gets his due in the one documentry and comentary on all three movies.  I really enjoy what he had to say about his classic trilogy.  But I need to hear more from the actors.  While they do get some words in, we just don't hear nearly enough from them.  Sadly, Marlon Brando doesn't even appear on the bonus disc.  And guys like Al Pacino, Robert DiNero, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Andy Garcia, and the guy who played Fredo (sorry, but I can't remember his name), need their own actors' documentry and actors' comentaries on the movies that they appear in.2) Now don't get me wrong, I adore the Godfather Part III.  But it has one fatal flaw.  And that is god-awful acting by Sophia Ford Coppola.  The preformances by Pacino and Garcia are to be regarded with the highest honors, but this is heavily marred by Sophia Ford Coppola.  It seems to me like Francis Ford coppola's only flaw in directing is his nepotism.  If he would have been fair and had casted a better actress for the part, then the Godfather III would be as respected as the other two.That being said, I love the Godfather trilogy.  Everyone I know loves it just as much.  Even if you are not a movie buff, I can pretty much guarentee that you'll like the Godfather Saga.Now, I offer a brief overview of the three films:1) Ah, yes the ledgendary first installment of the Godfather Saga.  Many ledgendary scenes that are now parodied, respected, well known, and imitated come from this movie.  Marlon Brando delivers the best preformence of his very famous career.  Duvall's preformence as Tom Hagen is also one of my favorites.2) The second installment is the perfect sequel.  There's no doubt about it.  This installment compliments the first part so well, that I believe that it is greater than the first.  Al Pacino and Robert DiNero deliver great preformences, in my opinion the best of there careers.3) Overlooked in many ways, the final installment is a classic ending.  Aside from the flawed acting of Sophia Ford Coppola, the thrid part offers a Shakespearian tragic ending, much like the first two.  Andy Garcia should have won an oscar for his preformence.As a final word, if you are like me and highly admire the Godfather Saga, then read Macievelli's The Prince.  It'll go nicely with the Godfather.	4.0	All three classics in one comprehensive box set	2004-07-20	2	2	0

Even if you have the 2001 set, this new version has a much crisper picture and sound, making it a much better experience to watch and fully enjoy. The new extras are wonderful such as the great documentary on the problems making the film and how the film has impacted popular culture. The leftover extras from the first set are still great like the hour-long documentary on the making of the saga and the slew of deleted scenes that do add new layers (and for thos complaining about this not being the ""Saga"" set, some of those scenes are included in this category).

I've spent hundreds already this year.Anyway, this is my first truly bad experience with Amazon.  I ordered this itemThe Godfather Collection (The Coppola Restoration) [Blu-ray] as a Deal of the Day on Feb 21.  You'd think, being a deal of the day, they'd actually have some in stock.  Nope.  I'm told I'll get the item sometime in mid March.I leave a comment about it, and I get an apology and I'm told they'll rush my order.  This moves the expected delivery up ONE WHOLE DAY.  Not a big deal in the end, since I've now received the item.  Fair enough, right?Nope again!!!  I open the item (it's mine now, isn't it?), pop it in the PS3, and we've got us a nice enough looking picture, but it's 4:3 (or thereabouts).  Certainly not the advertised 2.35:1, or the suspected actual 1.85:1 or 16:9 that others are reporting.  No, this has thick black bars on either side, and no, it's not my PS3, because everything else fills my screen.  My TV auto-detects the resolution of the input, and when the disk plays, it tells me it's changing from 1080i to 480i.Not pleased at all.  We'll see if they let me return it.Edit:  2nd set has arrived, and the same issue is present.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	APL7KHB0KKPA3	Michael H. Siegel	The 1970's are regarded by many as one of the greatest decade for movies.  it was a decade that saw Spielberg, Lucas, Scorcese, Polanski, Altman make their marks while titans like Kurosawa and Bergman were still producing breathtaking work.  Thus it is no faint praise to say that the greatest impact was from an Italian-American genius named Francis Ford Coppola, who produced two stunning motion pictures -- Godfather I and II.You know the story.  I won't bore you with regugitating the plot.  But if, like me, you haven't seen it in a while, you may have forgotten just how amazing these pictures are.  The cinematography, taking advantage of a technique no longer in use, is beautiful.  The cast reads like a Hollywood walk of fame and (for once) delivers like one.  And Coppola's direction is excellent both in character moments and in action scenes.  The movie take their time and revel in small details.  But that's how the weave a spell that draws the viewer in.Godfather III, while not up to the par of the first two, is still a fine motion picture.  The ire it has drawn is inevitable, given the 16-year wait.  A similar fate awaited Star Wars I after such a long delay.  And perhaps the ire is stirred by there being a great movie trapped in a merely good movie's body.  A little editing and a few more scenes to flesh out the plot made have made it a classic.  But it is what it is -- a good movie that lets us visit the world that fascinated us from the first two movies -- and even leaves us hungry for more (I would have loved to have seen a Godfather IV and/or more of Andy Garcia).Fortunately, Paramount has given the Godfather saga the treatment it deserves.  The movies sprawl over four DVD's, providing amazing sound and bringing out the movies' lush color palette beautifully.  Coppola has provided a commentary track that is hardly classic, but entertaining and insightful.  You realize how much he enjoyed making them, even as Paramount was trying to wrench control away.  The extras on DVD 5 are excellent, featuring deleted scenes, copious documentaries and footage of oscar speeches that are worth watching just see the horrifying suits worn to the 1972 oscars.I bought this mainly from a sense of obligation as a movie buff.  But after watching the Godfather saga for the first time in years, I was reminded of just why these are considered such classics.  Yeah, the price is a little steep, but it's worth it to see two of the true classic of modern cinema.	5.0	Classic movie, classic DVD's	2004-09-12	2	1	1

The Godfather Complete Epic combined the first two films into one movie, with the action taking place in chronological order.  In addition, some scenes that were originally edited out were put back in.  I much prefer ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather Part II"" in their original versions, which is the way they appear in this DVD collection.  Both movies won the Academy Award for best picture, which is an amazing achievement.  In addition, ""The Godfather Part III"" was nominated for best picture. A partial cast list includes some of the greatest actors of all time: Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire and Diane Keaton.What really sets the Godfather DVD Collection apart is the Bonus Materials disc. It includes a documentary on the making of the films, deleted scenes from all three movies, theatrical trailers and much more. I discovered a hidden bonus in a normally boring feature. In the section entitled ""DVD Credits"", I kept hitting next to fast forward past the extensive lists of names. After the last list, it takes you to a scene from the HBO series ""The Sopranos."" They're trying to watch a bootleg copy of the Godfather DVD! That's an extra surprise in a disc already packed with features."	5.0	You're Gonna Refuse This Offer? Fagetaboutit!	2001-12-28	35	32	3

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3SLZB9DPV9SSA	Michael Savasuk	By far some of the best movies i have ever seen. Al Pacino, after seeing these movies, is in my eyes one of the best, if not the best actor of his era, and one of the best of all time. So often you find movies with a incredible first movie, then the sequels tend to end up horrible.... But not this series. All three are by far some of the best movies out there. These movies also involve some of the best casting i have seen. With Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, and also Andy Garcia, who i think was well casted for the third movie. Maybe a little expensive to buy this set, but its definitely worth it. I would suggest this to anyone. Even if you arent interested in the mafia.	5.0	An offer you cant refuse	2002-07-13	1	1	0

They send a foregin version of the blu way that is defintley not the American version advertised on amazon. Hopefully the other sellers are more honest with thier products but I know Electronica Direct doesn't care. I have been buying DVDS/Blu Rays for 10 years (mostly through amazon and others through amazon) and never have I recieved a product that was not 100% authentic. Electronica Direct should be ashamed to call themselves a company. What kind of bussiness surives in this country when they can't even sell American products as promised without using some ripoff/bootleg foregin version of a product. Very disappointed. I have never had bad service like this in a long time. It's sad to think Electronica Direct think people are okay with them just sending false versions of a product out.

But Amazon offered a ""Black Friday"" price on the set that was almost too good to be true and I went for it. I'm glad I did.The picture on the restored films is warm and vibrant. I didn't do a side-by-side comparison with the DVDs from the 2001 set, but that's not really necessary. Even the dark scenes have a clarity and definition that I don't remember in earlier versions.It's also nice to have the films on single DVDs. I understand technical restrictions, quality control and the need to occasionally split feature films across multiple discs, but it's nice to be able to put the DVD in and watch it, period.The sound is excellent, but I don't have an audiophile setup. Sounds great on my system, so that's all that matters to me.I just received this and have watched the two restored films but have not yet seen the new documentaries. It was a wise marketing decision to carry over all of the ""bonus"" content from the 2001 set in addition to the three new documentaries.And Godfather III? Well, it's still Godfather III, isn't it? Often referred to as ""misunderstood,"" that may be true. I've always enjoyed Joe Mantegna's performance, and the saga does benefit from ""closure,"" but...well, it is what it is. The real draw here is the new versions of the first two films, which are two of the greatest films in the history of cinema...as ""essential"" as essential gets.My only caveat is to do what I did...keep an eye on the price and when the iron's hot, strike."	5.0	"This was a ""triple dip"" purchase for me, but worth it"	2011-12-02	3	3	0
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3RSEKPNOBYWTR	"MikeyV ""MikeyV"""	Look, the movies are great. No one can argue with that.  The problem is with the quality of the DVDs in this set.  It is terrible.  Everything is so dark and shadowy you can hardly tell who is on screen.  It is actually painful to watch.  I haven't seen the other DVD releases, but I also own the Godfather EPIC (edited chronologically) on VHS and the picture quality is far superior to this DVD collection.  Same goes for the versions I've seen on cable. Some might say that this is the nature of transferring a movie filmed in the early 70's to DVD.  Listen, it seems that Coppola et al spent quite a bit of time doing interviews and voice overs for this DVD collection - they should have spent more time making sure it looked good.  It is an insult to everyone who paid 80 bucks for the thing.One more thing.  It seems there is a problem with the quality of plastic used in the DVD cases.  It is much too brittle.  AFter you remove the DVD and replace it one time the part that holds the DVD in place cracks into little pieces, making the DVD fall out.  I can get a CD for 3 bucks and not have this problem.  Either someone wasn't thinking or was thinking too much.I feel like sending the thing to Coppola's winery with a dead fish inside.  The message - Francis Coppola's career swims with the fishes.	1.0	Rating the DVD collection, not the Movies	2002-09-30	32	19	13

Like many, I've been waiting for this release but I couldn't believe the shabby quality associated with it.  Paramount blew it!Many would like to have seen the release of the Godfather Saga/Epic, but that didn't happen so this 5 disk set had to do.And it was horrible.Godfather 1 and 2 are excellent movies.  Godfather 3 was a huge disappointment.Having said that, I still purchased this 5 disk set, hoping to view them in all the technical splendor Paramount had to offer.Apparently, they had none and released this poor quality offering for the money only, not for any artistic reasons.The video transfer is horrible but the audio was very good.  But, I want to watch AND hear a good movie.I returned this 5 disk set today and will not buy any subsequent release until I've read as many reviews as possible.Francis made Godfather 3 for the money and it appears Paramount released this disappointment for the same reason.	2.0	They made me an offer, and I refused!	2001-10-23	17	8	9

That being said, the restored versions of Godfather and Godfather II are outstanding.  I noticed a remarkable difference in the picture compared to the standard DVDs.  The biggest difference I noticed was the subtlety of the lighting throughout both movies. The sound has also been greatly enhanced.  You're able to hear a lot of background sound that previously was muttled.  Ten years ago I had the priviledge of seeing both movies at a movie theater - first time for me.

I will not go into a review of each film because it will have been done by so many others in different forums, but I will say this is a must have set.The supplements from the 2001 set release are all here and are in their original standard definition. The commentary by Coppola is also carried over (but it is never really exciting; though it can be interesting for a few minute details at times). The new extras for 2008 are all in high definition. Of the new extras, I really only found the featurette of ""The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn't"" and the featurette on the restoration process to be of any interest.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A309INQI4VP1O7	Mr. Puck	I watched The Godfather Part I on Blu Ray, from Netflix, side by side, against the standard DVD, which I already owned. The Blu Ray  was played on a Panasonic machine, and the standard was played on a Toshiba HD machine, and so was upconverted. Both were watched on a Sharp Aquos 40 inch, and the input was simply switched back and forth to access one movie or the other. They were synchronized to play the same scenes side by side. And I have to say that I just don't understand the RAVE reviews amongst the videophile crowd, who seem to feel that the Coppola restoration provides levels of artistic fidelity hitherto unknown to mortal man. The fact is that some scenes were better on the Blu Ray (and as one reviewer on Amazon pointed out, very HD-like), and some scenes actually were better on the standard. In addition, there was a kind of hyper-contrast and orange-ness to everything on the Blu Ray, that not everyone is going to like.

Sure, I can enthuse about the 3 films which to me far outclass any other films I have ever seen but I do feel that Paramount failed us all in their efforts. Lesser know DVD 'specials' include anything from booklets &amp; postcard/photographs to compliment the film, but in the Godfather set we had nothing??!!........we had the 3 films &amp; they are 'special' in themselves but would it not have been great to have had just a little bit more?????	4.0	Not Quite What I Was Hoping For........	2001-10-14	3	3	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1ZO0EMPHB3EOQ	"""muckiepup"""	Luckily I won't have to consider buying this long awaited DVD disappointment. A friend of mine picked it up the day of release and she had a viewing party. There is no need here to address the greatness of the The Godfather and The Godfather II, they are superb, wonderful, amazing films.However... this package we had to wait so long for is awful. Here's my first problem with it (and it's THE major problem)- The films were NOT restored for this release. The source prints used for the first two movies were damaged. Numerous wear spots and flecking, graininess in many scenes. Artifacts are readily apparent and often distract. What a blunder, what sheer laziness and bottom line gluttony. I can understand the greed-head thinking on Paramounts part,  they didn't have to spend any extra money on restoration to satisfy film buffs, DVD collectors and assorted video geeks as they would have normally for a DVD release of a film classic (i.e. Warner's brilliant Citizen Kane release). This is one of the most popular films of all time and the public at large will buy, buy, buy. Unfortunately, they are right.The other major problem I have? Being forced to pay for the awful, mind numbing bad Godfather III to get the first two films. Unconscionable.I have a prediction. In about 12 to 18 months from now you will hear about Paramount bringing to market SuperDelux - Extra Special Editions of the Godfather films, touting FULL RESTORATION and each film will be sold separately at a retail price of about $30-$35 or there abouts.	1.0	We waited ... and got stiffed.	2001-10-24	44	29	15

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A13NZZR8IA5782	Musicfan	Godfather 1 and Godfather 2 are among the ten greatest films ever made.  Godfather 2 is probably the finest sequel ever made.  Place these two with The Conversation and Apocalypse Now and Mr.  Coppola definitely takes his place, along with Capra, Ford, Lean, Hitchcock, Spielberg (to name a few), as one of the finest directors ever.  The extras on this DVD look outstanding.  The only problem is Godfather 3.  This movie is quite forgettable and was made for the cash,not because the story needed to be continued.  Coppola was asked why he felt Godfather 3 needed to be made (on a Bravo program), and he stated FOR THE MONEY!!  The movie is long, slow, and contrived.  It adds very little to the saga.  Although the collection looks great on features, I'll wait until Godfather 1 and 2 are released individually.  For those who plan to buy it, I can see why.  It may be worth the price just to get the first two installments!  I'll bet after a few months the dvd for the individual movies will be released and I'll buy the first two at that time.	4.0	A deal I shall refuse.	2001-09-27	15	2	13

I not only love the fact that each of the wonderful movies is represented (The Godfather, Part 2 being my favorite), but there is also a fourth disc which contains a documentary with interviews from Francis Ford Coppola and just about every cast member from these incredible films as well as many other extras. There is one particular extra in which you can view the Corleone family tree and learn some interesting facts about each member.I would highly suggest this DVD collection to any fan of the Godfather films.

What a gross rip-off. They just copied the three original disjointed parts and did not bother to put in the deleted scenes which do count for something. Eg. the rub-out of Fabrizio - that ... who allowed Appolonia to die - was never mentioned and Michael's painful recovery from that loss was never shown. Quality is no hell.

I would have given the set a 5 star rating but for some reason, there's lots of extra footage that you see in the &quot;Godfather Saga&quot; that was made for TV that is not included in the set. (Yes, I know, even though the write-up says the extra footage is included, any hardcore fan that knows every scene of the saga will easily identify that much of the extra footage for the &quot;Godfather Saga&quot; made for TV, is not there.) Why? Some of that footage is excellent and really fills in lots of scenes that were too brief.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1X910WAOVYV8M	"Nathan ""Cawntry-fried Calypso Beach Bum"""	"Everybody who is anybody knows how outstanding the first two movies are. They are widely considered in many circles to be two of the ten greatest films ever made, and deservedly so. I mean, it actually merits the overused description of cinematic genius in every way, and absolutely nothing can reduce the scope of this brilliantly dark and legendary Sicilian saga. When I bought this set, I had extremely high hopes for their content, and I must say I was not at all disappointed. The movies look beautiful, the sound is crystal clear, and the features are damn good too.From its incredible story to its artistic splendor to its career-launching performances, the original 'The Godfather' has everything that a truly great American gangster film should have. Marlon Brando, in the role of the aging Don Vito Corleone, is absolutely hypnotizing, in even the slightest mood or gesture. His prescence in unmistakeable. Of course, that doesn't at all undermine the heart and guts that Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, and the rest of the cast put into their performances. It is all-at-once a story about family, as well as a sociological study of violence, power, honor and obligation, corruption, justice and crime in America, with so many oft-quoted lines and instantly recognizeable scenes, undoubtedly one of the most startling and ingenious films Hollywood has ever seen. Whew! Now, it seems impossible, but 'The Godfather Part II' actually met the standard set by the original, some would say it even surpassed it. It serves as both a prologue and a sequel, masterfully intercutting between the rise of youthful Don Vito Corleone to Mafia chief in the early 1900s in the Little Italy section of New York City and the career of Corleone's son Michael in the late 1950s from his patriarchal prime to his decline a year later. Robert De Niro gives an uncommonly subtle performance as Vito Corleone, struggling to provide for his family in turn-of-the-century immigrant life, eventually finding himself lured into a life of crime. Al Pacino is staggeringly good once again as Michael, but probably the most overlooked performance is John Cazale as his pathetic and whimpering brother Fredo. His every word and mistake, is almost heartbreaking. 'Part II' is much more somber in its tone and almost feels like Greek tragedy, as Michael Corleone, knowing it is his destiny to lead the family, inevitably finds himself unable to come to grips with his demons, leaving him contemplative and spiritually-broken. If that doesn't give you chills and make you say ""Dayyyum!"" then you just don't understand great poignant art. As for 'The Godfather Part III'. Ah, I don't know, it's good, and I suppose it is somewhat underrated. After all, living up to the standard set by the first two is a damn-near impossible feat. Andy Garcia and Bridget Fonda both turn in good work, and Sofia Coppola isn't nearly as bad as she has been made out to be. There are a few memorable scenes and Pacino did give us one of the most oft-quoted lines of the '90s (""Just when I thought I was out... they pulled me back in."") but it was just bookending it too quickly.I'm very happy with this set, and I think the film company did a beautiful job in their presentation of this trilogy. I particularly liked watching the Oscar acceptance speeches. Coppola is such an exuberant and excitable fella, its hard to believe a seemingly-regular person was the driving force behind these two larger-than-life masterpieces. I do think its kind of odd that neither of the two actors that won Oscars for any of the films, were present to accept their award at the Academy Awards telecast of 1972 and 1974. That really makes me wonder, because it seems that rarely happens anymore. Alright, I think I've said enough now, so I'll end by saying that this set is definitely worth what they're charging (an arm and a leg), because this trilogy belongs in even the most casual film fans' collection."	5.0	Excellent presentation of the complete Corleone legacy...	2002-04-11	3	1	2

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1M9DQDGE07Q0U	Nix Pix	Francis Ford Coppola's ?The Godfather? trilogy represents a landmark achievement in American cinema. Okay, maybe not Part III, but cumulatively. The first film established the benchmark of excellence that by Part III was starting to look rather clich?. In ?The Godfather? we are introduced to Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), a Mafia kingpin who rules his underworld empire with compassion and family honor at heart. What is fascinating about Coppola?s interpretation of the Mafia is that it examines them not as criminals per say, but as struggling immigrants unable to secure their place in the new world without being forced to resort to intimidation and violence.  In the first film, the Corleone empire is threatened almost from the star. After the jubilant wedding of the Don?s only daughter, Connie (Talia Shire) the Don is almost assassinated. Michael (Al Pacino), the son who has been groomed for legitimate business, vows revenge and achieves it in assassinating the rival Don whose orders almost killed his father. But when the heir to Vito?s throne, Sunny (James Caan) is brutally murdered at a toll booth, Michael is forced to step in and assume control of his father?s underworld empire.Stemming from a prior incident, Paramount didn?t want Brando on the film. Ditto for Al Pacino, though in that instance their apprehension seems to have been predicated on the fact that Al was then an unknown quantity in Hollywood. Shire had to practically beg Coppola for her role. It all worked out in the end. ?The Godfather? set a benchmark for cinema violence and took home the Best Picture Oscar. Two years later, ?The Godfather: Part II? would sweep the award, winning more Oscars than its predecessor.In Part II Coppola?s formula film making is cemented by a parallel storyline: the first picks up where part one left off, with Michael now married to Kay (Dianne Keaton) and living near Lake Tahoe where they raise their children. However, as part two progresses the marriage disintegrates into a bitter custody battle. The other plot point of Part II regresses to 1930s New York and charts the rise to power of Don Vito, on this occasion played to perfection by Robert DeNiro. Part II is by far the most intricately balanced and thoroughly explorative of ?The Godfather? trilogy.Part III is something of a rehash and a disappointment. It assumes a straight forward story involving the aged Michael. Reconciled with Kay ? at least on speaking terms ? and now a struggling diabetic, Michael?s hopes for his children are shattered when his son refuses to pursue a law degree and his daughter, Mary (Sophia Coppola) is accidentally assassinated on the steps of the La Scala Opera House. The penultimate showdown of Part III is reminiscent of the final acts of the previous two films. It offers nothing new or viscerally stirring to the saga of this crime family. Evidently, the Academy of Arts and Sciences agreed. ?The Godfather: Part III? took home no Oscars.The DVD transfers of these three films from Paramount Home Video are in short a dismal disappointment. Although Coppola did shoot his films with a decidedly dated look, none of the transfers included in this collection are anything but dated by the ravages of time. Color fidelity and balance are inconsistently rendered. Flesh tones are either faded pink or too orange. Blacks, browns, dark grays and blues all appear as one gigantic muddy brown mess. Fine detail is completely lost. Digital compression artifacts, film grain, aliasing, fine detail shimmering and video noise are prominent throughout.Oddly enough, out of all the transfers, Part I looks the best while Part III, the newest of the bunch, represents the worst example of tiling and color bleeding that I've seen in any film from the eighties. Also, Part II is inexplicably spread across two discs. Paramount?s reasoning is presumably to avoid compression related problems on a lengthy film -which still abound - yet Part III, which shares almost the same running time, is compressed onto one disc. Chapter references on all three films is bare bones - for a three hour movie, twelve chapter stops is inadequate. All the extras for these films are lumped together on a separate disc, but with all the problems I've just listed and the added disappointment of not being chapter referenced. Unfortunately, for fans of these immortal classics, Paramount Home Video has given us an offer all too easy to refuse!	2.0	REALLY STEAMED OVER AN OFFER TOO EASY TO REFUSE!	2003-02-28	12	7	5
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2P6C4G1F8GSI0	N. Newby	This movie takes you behind the fact of murder & mayhem of the mob, but into their family lives; how close knit they are as a whole.  James Caan, Al Pacino (especially Al) , Robert DeNero & yes even Marlon Brando are at their best as father & sons. It's strange out the father came to America to get away from 'mob crime bosses' and actually ended up in that situation again, trying to survive and still have a family life.

Instead, it was pan and scanned to 1.78:1 (16:9) to fill HDTV screens without a small but necessary letterbox.  Therefore, part of every frame is cut out. It is inexcusable for this landmark piece of American film history. Amazon has the spec wrong, and the packaging conveniently does not list the aspect ratio. For all of the reviewers who don't notice or complain about this, maybe they have never viewed these discs. Unfortunately I did not notice until it was too late to return it, otherwise I would have. The video quality is also poor for the hype of it being the ""Coppola Restoration."""	1.0	This is NOT in original aspect ratio (1.85:1). It is pan & scanned to 16:9 (1.78:1)	2012-07-08	24	15	9

It looks and sounds much better than the old Godfather DVD Collection which was released in 2001 a.  The colors on on the new Godfather Giftset DVD are more lighter and brighter and the sounds are remastered so the DVD would sound more better than the previous godfather DVD collection. The Godfather Coppola Restoration has five discs which disc four has the original special features from the previous Godfather DVD collection.  Disc 5 has new special features like the Godfather World which they talk the phenomenal godfather movies had impacted on our culture for many years on other filmmakers.I have to say that they really did a good job on making these godfather movies look and sound much better.

I'm not complaining, because I'm trusting it will look great once I get an HD TV even if it's on dvd and not Blu-ray.I find myself buying DVDs for the special features and that was the case here with two DVDs devoted to special features. Coppola's commentary is fantastic and there are some deleted scenes as well as some clever, interesting and then sometimes desperate, ""I'll use anything,"" special features.On the back of the supplements dvd of ""The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration,"" it says one of the special features is ""The making of the GodFather."" I don't know how long  I spent going over the special features looking for ""The making of the Godfather,"" but it turned out to be a long upsetting night for all involved. I came to realized the main reason I purchased this box set was for this one special feature and it doesn't really exist. There are featurettes  that talk about an aspect of the making, like the music, or ""filming locations,"" or if I want to sit in silence squinting to read bio's I might find a trinket of something about the actual shooting, but where is the making of the Godfather? Where are those great screen tests I've seen before of Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, James Caan and Robert De Niro auditioning? How about the Brando 's home made screen test?

I cannot believe this is the best they could do with this movie. Its all hype and no sustenance. Save your money and dont buy this.Since I first received this I have bought a few ""older"" movies as well to see how they compare to this. I picked up A Clockwork Orange and also The Shining. How could they have messed up Godfather so bad in comparison? Both of those movies in Blu Ray are not even in the same ballpark as the Godfather ""restoration"".

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2VF3BXFXXTEPL	Patrick Graham	There is little argument that The Godfather is one of the best movies ever made and there should be little argument that The Godfather DVD collection is as good as any.It is a little pricey ..., but I think it is well worth it.  This is a collection of some of the best movies ever made combined with some extras that only enhance your knowledge of The Godfather series.Originally based on the books by Mario Puzo, The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone crime family and their exploits.  All of the sights and sounds of this immense production come alive on DVD and are as vibrant and intense as any movie out there.Everyone knows that this is a classic movie, but when bundled with the second and third installments and an entire disc of extras it goes beyond being great.  It is extraordinary.	5.0	A DVD I Can't Refuse!	2002-05-29	2	1	1

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AUDSM2CTLLW1Q	Patrick L. Randall	The Godfather movies are the stuff of cinematic legend.  Godfather's I and II are two of the finest movies ever made and both rank as #1 and #3, respectively, in the IMDB Top 250 All-Time list.  Godfather III is a lesser film and confusing to watch if you have not seen the first two.  But, it is still a compelling chapter in the Godfather legacy.  The release of the Godfather DVD collection has been long-awaited and the result is very rewarding.  In addition to getting the digitally remastered prints of each movie, there is an entirely separate CD that is packed with a cornucopia of extras about Godfather Trilogy.  The extras are simply wonderful.  There is the obligatory 'making of' documentary (which is supposed to be very good, but I have no seen yet), clips from the 1973 and 1975 Academy Awards where each movie took home best Oscar from the previous year, and family tree that shows how all members of the Corleone Family are connected (with brief biographies of each).  The true gem, however, is the deleted scenes section.  It makes sense that, in the interest of running time and story continuity, these scenes were left out.  However, the deleted scenes do not contradict anything from the movies and actually provide compelling background and side stories.  Among the list of deleted scenes is one where Michael Corleone tracks down and orders the hit on his bodyguard that was responsible for the death of his first wife 10 years earlier and another scene where Vito Corleone exacts revenge on all the men responsible for his family's death in turn of the century Sicily (not just Don Ciccio).  Even if you own all the Godfather movies on VHS and have seen each of them many times, the Godfather DVD collection is still a 'must-have'.  It broadens and expands the already mesmerizing world of the Corleone Family.	5.0	Wonderful supplement to the Godfather legend	2002-07-05	0	0	0

I'm disappointed but also a fan so I will enjoy what I purchased and keep looking for the re-edited version where the time line starts at the beginning and does not jump back and forth. I enjoyed all 3 films in the theater. I'm happy but not thrilled. peace, Packy Paules	3.0	The chronologic saga of the Corleone family.	2011-01-07	1	0	1

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2SMWZMHGT2LBH	Patrick T. Peterson	Watching this movie over 30 years after seeing it for the first time, now with my wife and 15 yr. old son, was quite an experience.  This movie is masterful.Still gory, though not as bad as the more recent trend in graphic violence, I caution those with delicate sensibilities.The values of the characters are so horrible and the contradictions in their beliefs so obvious that it's still amazing to me how individuals can compartmentalize such things.The actors who were, or became super famous from this movie are breathtaking:Brando was already a star, but continued in this iconic role.Al Pacino was the new and increasingly powerful star.Diane Keaton's role here was limited, but she went on to bloom as a fine actress.Robert Duvall started here and went on to become do legendary acting.James Caan was featured here and continued a fine career.Talia Shire, who I did not remember was in this,  went on to do a great role in Rocky.Abe Vigoda was an excellent character actor.If you have time, treat yourself to this magnificent work.And note, that the mob makes it's money from the things that government makes illegal, but which people will buy anyway:booze (prohibition, not in this movie), prostitution, gambling, drugs, etc.  And along the way, the police, courts, politicians and even the church are totally corrupted with the mob's undue profits from those businesses being illegal.	5.0	Another classic	2014-03-04	0	0	0

Just likeCitizen Kane,Rear Window,Sunset Boulevard,Raging Bull,The Sound of MusicandCasablanca, THE GODFATHER trilogy (especially the first and the second films) helped the shaping of American Cinema. These films are landmarks: unsurpassed masterpieces.To say that the saga of the Corleone family and more particularly Michael Corleone (who says to his girlfriend Kay ""It's my family. Not me""... but cannot and will not escape the ""family"" in his genes) nearly reinvented American Cinema in the 70's is an understatement.This Blu-ray edition features all the three films in a glorious High Definition restoration with STUNNING picture and sound. You cannot find a better product anywhere that will do justice to the great cinematic work presented.The Blu-ray Collection includes:DISC 1:The Godfather feature filmCommentary by director Francis Ford CoppolaDISC 2:The Godfather, Part II feature filmCommentary by director Francis Ford CoppolaDISC 3:The Godfather, Part III feature filmCommentary by director Francis Ford CoppolaDISC 4:Godfather World (HD)The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn't (HD)...when the shooting stopped (HD)Emulsional Rescue--Revealing The Godfather (HD)The Godfather on the Red Carpet (HD)Four Short Films on The GodfatherThe Godfather vs. The Godfather, Part II (HD)Cannoli (HD)Riffing on the Riffing (HD)Clemenza (HD)The Family TreeCrime Organization ChartConnie and Carlo's Wedding Album2001 DVD Archive:Behind the ScenesThe Godfather Family: A Look InsideThe Godfather Family: A Look InsideOn LocationFrancis Coppola's NotebookThe Music of the GodfatherCoppola & Puzo on ScreenwritingGordon Willis on CinematographyStoryboards from The Godfather, Part IIStoryboards from The Godfather, Part IIIThe Godfather Behind the Scenes 1971The FilmmakersFrancis Ford CoppolaMario PuzoGordon WillisDean TavoularisNino RotaCarmine CoppolaAdditional ScenesAcclaim & ResponseTrailers (HD)Photo GalleryRogues' Gallery...And brand new Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround (48kHz/24-bit) tracks for all three films.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1TPV370JK1H1T	Paul Sorenson	"The mafia. If you ever did business with one of these people, you would either wind up dead or with much less money in your pocket. These people would not make ideal friends, but one thing remains for sure: the mafia is freakin' cool.From Hollywood's colorless beginning, filmmakers have been fascinated with the idea of a private organization capable of running the entire government. Films like ""Public Enemy"" defined the genre, and ever since, filmmakers have strived to capture this dangerous yet intriguing lifestyle.""The Godfather,"" a film by Francis Ford Coppola, is undisputedly the best mafia film. In fact, movie fans have voted this 1972 film their #1 movie of all time on imdb.com. Why is this movie so great?First of all; it's just darn good filmmaking. It captures 1930's New York in such a superb fashion that it might as well been filmed in that era. The script, written by Coppola and Mario Puzo (who also wrote the book), is wonderful. Coppola also perfects the art of directing with this film.The cast; oh the cast! Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, and James Cann are all in this one film, who could ask for more? (If you were to want more, however, you will be glad to know that Robert DeNiro plays a key role in Part II). This is possibly the most talented group of actors ever assembled in a film, and it shows. Their own identity is washed completely away when they are on screen. The acting is just that good.Even if all the above elements were in place, ""The Godfather"" would only be a sub-par movie if it wasn't for a great story. And hot-diggity-dog, is it a great story.This movie does not create a genre; it expands and perfects one. Unlike many mob movies, the characters in ""The Godfather"" are not 2-dimensional. Although they are not of the nicest of people, they are still human. In the Corleone family, around which the film is centered, family values are very important.This is hypocritical, for the adults in the family make their living by invoking fear and death in their community. This impossible balance between morality and greed is very real in ""The Godfather."" Throughout the film, its characters are in constant internal battle to try to retain some sort of moral ground. This internal battle is mixed with the external battle of the mob world, and its results provide film lovers with an unbelievably powerful movie.There is also a form of this wonderful story in paper and ink. Although ""The Godfather,"" the book was the basis for the film, the film is the full realization of the story of the Corleone family. Puzo, the author, not only helped write the screenplay for ""The Godfather,"" but also for ""The Godfather Part II"" and ""The Godfather Part III."" These films provide a full scope of the rise and fall of a powerful mob family, whereas the book only gives a glimpse.Is ""The Godfather"" worth seeing? Without a doubt. In fact, it's worth buying and possibly even memorizing. Its successors, especially ""The Godfather Part II,"" contain an awe-inspiring greatness that will not be found in many, if any, other films. The ""Godfather"" films should not be missed by any human being. They are simply that great."	5.0	THE GODFATHER is God	2003-02-02	1	0	1
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AKTWQY8AHGMYS	Pavel	The quality of the BDs is good and exactly what I expected.What is a big disapointment though is the package quality. After opening, the paper box dismantled itself. The glue that sticks the parts of the box together was there, but it didn't mean much.Part of the package is a booklet. But it is slightly bigger, so you cannot put it back inside.In overall - Such a quality product deserves better packaging.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	APAJBW2D79LRZ	"P. Babin ""MotionStory"""	I write this having only seen The Godfather disk and the bonus material disk.And what a pleasure it was!My experience of this DVD brought back many of the feelings I recall from the theater viewings of 20 plus years ago, when I'd see both I and II in an afternoon. There are a lot of erudite musings in these reviews about the significance of The Godfather in the history of the late 20th Century. I was struck by how operatic the damn thing is, melodramatic, grand, sweeping. The tragic journey one takes in sitting through the movie is exhausting and strangly satisfying in a morbid way.I'm the first to complain about technical issues, and I have nothing but praise. You see now, finally, the entire image side to side as was intended by the film makers. The sound track is rich and revealing as so many digital renditions are nowadays.I don't understand complaints about picture quality and dark photography. You should have seen the abomination that was the laser disk! If anything, this video is pumped up slightly and more revealing in shadow detail that Gordon Willis originally gave us in the theatrical release prints. The image is clean and timed and telecined with love and care.The bonus material is fun and very revealing of the maestro's delightful and passionate nature. I had the pleasure of working with him on two pictures. He's a man who cares deeply and sincerely about his artistry. That spirit is evident in these disks.	5.0	Like an old friend	2001-11-07	18	16	2

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A8UP1XQUY71KE	"""philomalin"""	"This is a special note for people who have NOT YET seen either of the Godfather installments, or at least who haven't yet viewed Part III: I am utterly appalled by the widely irrational amount of negative comments on THE GODFATHER PART III. Yes, one has to admit that Part III is different in style and narrative approach than Parts I &amp; II, AND one also has to admit that it is also an EXCELLENT movie that does deserve all the praise that Parts I &amp; II attracted. I am currently writing my Master's in Philosophy and I have to say that I really enjoyed the ""GREEK TRAGEDY"" aspects of the Part III -you will see in the BONUS DISC F.F. Coppola explain why he chose to give this Part an additional level of moral questioning, another layer of PHILOSOPHICAL depth (that perhaps Parts I &amp; II lack a little -just a thought). DIRECTOR Coppola has worked extensively with AUTHOR Mario Puzo (by the way, do read the book, it adds another very distinctive flavor  to your experience of the movie -the end is quite different, enough said!) and that is perhaps why Parts II and III are so excellent too (Part I is more or less already in the book, but II and III had to be invented). Thus, Part III has extraordinarily moving quality that makes the whole series complete. THANK GOD I had never read the other Amazon reviews that say Part III is less good before watching all three movies - I would have then expected to be disappointed. Instead of that, I was warned that each Part was quite different from each other but that all were INDISPENSABLE to create the full range of nuances that make our UNIQUE experience of THE GODFATHER. As I work in a movie theatre, I am acutely aware that more than quality as such, it is beforehand `expectations' about the movie (""it's a nice and cute little movie"", ""it's the greatest masterpiece of all time""...) that create satisfaction or disappointment after the viewing. So, please, `expect to see' three very good and very different movies. Forget about comparing one with the others, just enjoy the cathartic* experience and let yourself be transformed. (I couldn't resist the fact of adding the meaning of `cathartic' because it depicts SO WELL what happens to the GODFATHER fan watching the series: ""producing a feeling of being purified emotionally, spiritually, or psychologically as a result of an intense emotional experience...&quot; --Encarta World English Dictionary  1999 Microsoft Corporation.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2GGIXJ3JWOHH8	Phuoc Le	I rate this DVD collection with a 3-star, and not the movies in the collection.  I'd give the movies a 3 1/2 stars... I don't find them as great as everyone else.  This is kind of like people that enjoy Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey... that was horrible, but somehow people seem to accord it this great deference.The Godfather stories are pretty decent and the acting is great, but come one, I had a hard time understanding some of the lines, especially Marlon Brando and his wheezy, smoky voice (or however you described his performance).As for the transfer, I've seen much much better from older films.  The Godfather was very dark, full of noise and the color was off.  Want a look at a great transfer from an old film?  Try My Fair Lady... seriously, I'm a little disappointed.	3.0	I've seen better transfer from movies much older than this	2003-01-14	19	5	14

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	The first two Godfather movies are among a small handful of films that can truly be called cinematic classics.  Everything from the acting to the directing to the writing to the musical scores are as close to perfection as you can get.  Francis Ford Coppola's direction and writing are impeccable, but what he really showed was a brilliant eye for talent.  Many of the stars of the Godfather movies are now household names, but at the time of the movies releases, were virtual unknowns.  Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert DeNiro, Robert Duvall and James Caan turned in performances that catapulted them to A-list actors.  Even legend Marlon Brando had career resurgence thanks to his cool and commanding performance as Don Vito Corleone.  While Mr. Brando was the star of the first part, the real centerpiece of the movies is Mr. Pacino.  His transformation of Michael from the bright-eyed, caring war hero to the cold, calculating and ruthless head of the family is the finest performance of his distinguished career.  Robert DeNiro is amazing the young Vito Corleone in Part II and the fact that he does the part completely in Italian makes his performance all the more captivating.  James Caan also gives a career performance as the fiery Sonny Corleone whose death scene is one of the most violent and rememberable of all time.  All the actors hit the right notes and even the legendary acting teacher Lee Strassberg, who never appears in movies, shines in an Oscar nominated performance as Hyman Roth.  The first two parts were released in 1972 and 1974 respectively and both won the best picture Oscars (Part II is the only sequel to do as such), Mr. Brando won for best actor in '72 (he famously refused the award), Mr. DeNiro won Best Supporting Actor in '74 and Mr. Coppola took home the best director award in '74.  Part III was released in 1990, sixteen years after the second part and is an often maligned film.  The film suffers mainly from the fact that it has to live up to the unreachably high standards the first two films set.  It does suffer from bad casting as Mr. Coppola's daughter Sophia is in way over head in a pivotal role of Michael's daughter Mary, George Hamilton oozes too much smarm in his role and Joe Mantegna is lifeless as Joey Zaza.  But in light of those poor performances, there are numerous others that shine including Andy Garcia as Vincent who is the illegitimate son of Sonny Corleone. Mr. Garcia exudes the fiery anger of Mr. Caan's character and his performance is a real star turner.  Of course Mr. Pacino is still electric as Michael and Ms. Keaton is beautifully understated as his put upon wife Kay.  Part III isn't as essential as the first two parts, but it is a better than average film and a nice coda to the series.  In addition to the three films there is a bonus disk that has some great features including screen tests and a documentary on the making of the earlier films.  The Godfather series has taken on almost mythical proportions and helped introduce the world of the mafia to mainstream America and this DVD collection does a magnificent job of presenting their overall brilliance to the home viewing experience.	5.0	American Masterpieces	2001-10-10	21	19	2

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A15W2D3WJW7NP7	Pork Chop	"THE GODFATHER (1972) was clearly ahead of its time, when it wasreleased, from its many aspects and from its 3 hour duration, muchcan be said of it, mostly about Mario Puzo's imagination andpersonality.First, many will be critical of Puzo's opinion that Italiancivilization is the peak in human achievement, comprising wine fromgrapes, olive oil, a peak in culture development comprisingsophisticated music, cuisine, high standard of etiquette, complexmarriage, baptism, funeral rites and ceremonies, multi-generationalhouseholds with grand parents and grand children living under thesame roof, etc. As such, this movie is an emotional outburst and ashout to the world "" I love Italy"" which is not suprising, for anItalian book author.Secondly, in addition to the tribalism, another weakness is thenostalgia expressed in the movie, such as being 21 years old again,finding a spouse, entering adulthood and marriage, with all thepressures that entails, the joy of Christmas and the family, etc.This generosity by Puzo is in a part a gift to the feminine viewersin providing entertainment, by underlining the personal, intimateaspects of relationships, emotions, the birth of children, schools,playgrounds, etc. But it shows that a man is multi-dimenensiol.Clearly it is unrealistic to suggest that most or many ItalianAmericans originate from cow pasture, bare mountain spots in Sicily,from poverty stricken villages. In fact, Italy was and still is oneof the most prosperous nations on the Earth, and only a tiny fractionof its population emigrated, the rest staying behind, most with full,natural lives, obviously.Thirdly, the movie shows a reluctance or a hesitance in the Italianethnic members in USA, in integrating into the mainstream culturally,behaviorally, socially, such as, for example, in terms of thesexually liberal conduct typical of  American. Puzo transposes hisown reluctance in letting go of his European and Old World beliefsand values vs. present day-to-day society in USA. This is notrealistic, as 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants, for the most part,lose all notion of their ancestors' language, cuisine, traditions,ceremonial requirements, religious behaviors, etc, and that includesItalian-Americans, clearly fully joining the mainstream.Those aspects are only liablilities for those who do not descend fromRoman European countries, while for those who do descend, they arecuriousities, and paradigms, interesting observations.The positives of this movie, is the full spectrum of emotions, widerange of  experiences shown that comprise a human being ... the filmdoes require 3 hours to show those and does it well.A surprising suggestion from Puzo, is that a Santa-Claus twin existedin the USA at the turn of the 20th century, handing out favors, jobs,contracts, promotions, justice as he saw fit, and people would turnto him endlessly as if he was a witch doctor solving those ills thatnowhere and nobody else could solve, such as through the justicesystem, a capitalist market, the responsible, good citizen conductfrom people at large. This is played by Marlon Brando, to perfection.Another strength is the courage of the story in reflecting problemsat large, such as corrupt law officers, judges, politicians,manipulated unions, personal animosities in companies that result inrivals being left in the dust for trivial slights of ego, gambling,prostitution, drinking rackets, etc, with the narco-trafficking onthe horizon, and the Las Vegas scene in its infancy.Perhaps the most significant statement, in the movie, is Puzoshifting from the early chest-pounding of Italian-Americanism, whocan do no wrong,  mid-way through the movie, as he focuses on theinter-gang fighting among various crime bosses and gangs forterritory, each set on monopolizing the market, with betrayals,traps, strategic  maneuvering behind the scenes, and gang-banging.Puzo's wisdom, as well, is his notion that corrupted individuals arenot permanently bought, nor would they provide unlimited protectionor favors once bought. Brando is shown calculating mentally how farhis powerful personal contacts could go in  supporting various typesof mobster projects, this skill having taken him to the top of theNYC underworld over many years, in addition to skill in readingpsychologically his opponents intentions from assessing them when intheir presence.James Caan's character, according to Puzo, suggests a temperament, apropensity to libidinous and hotheaded behavior that is not typicalof most Italian-Americans, which seems to stereotype needlessly thelatter group, as he's shown as having been an adopted son.Overall, the movie is outstanding from the point of view of creatingtension, suspense, surprising viewers with the turn of events, inconnecting with viewers, showing culturally the struggle of ItalianAmericans in leaving behind the civilization learn in the so-calledOld World as they take their space on the American continent.  Themature subject will be difficult to take for many, such as brutalityfrom guns and car bombs and the taking out of fellow human beings asmere pieces on a chessboard."	5.0	Fertile imagination.	2009-01-05	8	2	6
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A24TI20NX369GE	P. Pruitt	The Godfather I and II are perhaps two of the greatest movies ever made, a fact which is clear from watching them.  Godfather III, however, is a movie that, while not quite being horrible, is far from good. Pacino's performance is excellent in I and is perhaps the best part of II but, in III, there is very little interesting plot for him to work with so his performance falters.  The best performance of the trilogy, however, comes from Marlon Brando, who makes Vito Correleone one of the greatest characters in movie history.  On the whole, these three movies are exellent.Overall, the sound and video quality is excellent, although there were a few scenes where you could see the wear and tear on the video and where the sound degraded.  Other than that the DVD series was excellent and I would highly reccomend purchasing it.	4.0	Great Movies, Except for Part III	2002-01-07	1	1	0

So of course I owned them on VHS... then I bought them again on DVD... and Now I'm the proud owner of the entire trilogy (plus a bunch of extras and an over sized booklet) on Blu-Ray.Was it worth the money to buy this set again?  I guess it depends on who you are and what you like.  First of all, I generally prefer theatrical versions to any other versions of films - there are a few exceptions of course, but on the whole I prefer the theatrical release - which is what these BDVDs are.  Many people will not be huge fans of the graininess of the film or the orange hue of the film.  Expecially if you are used to watching the extremely sharp and crisp newer movies released on Blu-ray.  But there is something about that grainy texture and warm lighting that makes this film seem all the more immediate, they welcome the viewer in and you quickly forget yourself in the rise and fall of Michael.So yes to me the investment was well worth the purchase, we have watched these movies hundreds of times and it feels like every time I catch yet another subtle nuance, gesture or deeper meaning.Others will find this to be a waste of their hard earned money - they just want to see the movie.  Some people are content to just watch it when it comes on A&E; - but to the true fans, the upgrade to Blu-ray is a must.	5.0	One of the few movies that I would honestly rate 5 stars	2009-07-13	6	6	0

I've been noticing that a lot of the reviews say ""THIS IS A FAITHFUL RESTORATION OF THE ORIGINALS!!!!"". Well that wasn't what I got in this set.I wanna know what the 4 and 5 star reviewers were smoking when watching this set. Now yeah it's true that this set contains less grain than the 2001 DVD release. But I want to know what Coppola was doing in the year it took him to restore the films.As soon as I opened the set, I put in the disc for the first one and watched it. The wedding scene at the beginning is where I noticed how over-saturated the picture is. The whites look more blue than white. THe rest of the film wasn't more different. At times there was a noticeable and annoying red tint over some certain scenes that made the picture look bad.Part 2 was not much different either. The opening scene with the kissing of the hand had an annoying orange tint over it. Upon seeing this, I asked myself ""Who restored this? Heidi Montag???"". There was notable print damage in some scenes too.One reviewer stated that there were some parts that looked like they had adjusted the F-Stop, and it was distracting. I couldn't agree more. That happened a LOT throughout Part 3, especially the ending. Sad thing is, the worst in the series (Part 3) looked the best. I can't say the same for Part 1 and 2 though.The extras were fine, no complaints. People are bitching about the TV versions not being on here- I beg to differ. I don't care a single bit about the TV versions. The audio is not bad, bough you have to have the right sound system for it.In short, just keep the original set.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3OL7KXGV0VOHD	R. Grimaldi	I love Bluray and I love the Godfather so this appeared to be a perfect marriage. But, right from the start I was wondering if I had received the wrong discs or something. In some cases the picture quality seems to be not even as good as some previous DVD versions played via a BluRay player, in other cases the picture quality is downright terrible. What exactly did they spend that year they claim the restoration took doing? I understand that older movies won't ever look as good as other BluRay transfers but this is basically a rip-off. I have several other versions of these movies and wouldn't have bought this one if i had had any sense that the picture quality would not be any better....who would? I have the best possible set up from a player/television/connections standpoint so it isn't the equipment. Save your money and use one of the prior releases.	2.0	Uggh	2008-10-03	11	4	7

The restoration is done very well giving the movies the pure feel of the original prints including the grit of the actual film production. There was some damage/deterioration to the originals which was painstakingly corrected along with much better sound quality. All of this is explained in the bonus DVD which is just another perk to owning this set, as well as a little cast/movie booklet.If you have never seen any or all of these movies, this is a must-see movie collection. I had never seen parts II or III and was very pleased to finally understand the Godfather saga.The movie stories are well acted and intriguing depicting the life of Mafia types including the killings as well as the commitment to ""family"" showing honor along with treachery.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1GHO6BR5J0NHX	Richard Masloski	"Since I bought this boxed set primarily for the Supplements, I will focus on those featurettes to hopefully help others decide whether or not to buy this edition for themselves.Firstly, there are two discs of Supplements.  (The back of the slipcase's listing for the contents of Disc Four and Disc Five are reversed so that what is listed for Four is actually on Five and vice versa.  Somebody screwed-up.)The supplements are as follows, along with my comments.1) Making of the Godfather (a.k.a. ""Behind the Scenes""):  This is a bit confusing as there is ""The Making of the Godfather"" listed on the slipcase, but on the Disc this section is entitled ""Behind the Scenes"" and includes some of the items I single out below to discuss. ""A Look Inside"" is the first and longest section and covers alot of ground.  It is amazing to watch the screen tests of Al Pacino and, when the studio was still unsold on Pacino, we see James Caan being tested for the role of Michael!  And DeNiro being screen tested for the part of Sonny!  And Martin Sheen even is shown briefly reading for the part of Michael!  This is wonderful stuff to see.  Unfortunately, Brando's screen test is absent (it is minimally shown in a later extra, but I have seen much fuller footage of this historic screen-test elsewhere, and it SHOULD have been included in somewhere amongst these extras in a more extensive form.  It also seems that with ""Behind the Scenes"", way too much effort is expended in trying to push and promote the dubiously meritorious third installment of the Corleone saga.  We also learn practically nothing about Mario Puzo -  where he came from and where he came up with his ideas and what research was involved. Did a horse-head type incident ever happen in reality?  Was  the Johnny Fontane character truly based on Frank Sinatra and his bid for ""From Here to Eternity""? Things like that. There is also nothing of the Italian-American Civil Rights League's initial opposition to the production of the film. No discussion of the actual history of the Mafia is offered, even briefly. It would have been most interesting to say the least. And no mention is made of the great John Cazale's (Fredo)enormous contribution to Godfather parts I and II. On a scale of 1-10, this feature rates a 6, primarly because of the screen tests that are shown.2)  Additional scenes:  I found these to be very interesting, some of course much more than others.  But on the whole, these deleted scenes from the three films are quite illuminating.  It is nice to know that Michael eventually avenges his Sicilian wife's death.  It is great to see Tom Hagen's wife, too!3)  Filming Locations:  Interesting, but way too short.  The only location actually discussed is the use of a real street in the East Side of lower Manhattan.  Mention is made of a contemporaneous film student documenting the making of Godfather II on this street - and some of that documentary is shown.  It would have been nice to have seen the entire documentary, though.  But, given the world-wide backdrop of the Corleone saga, one would think that this featurette would have been more encompassing.4)  The Corleone Family Tree:  this is simply a graphic.  Pure padding.5)  The Music of the Godfather:  Simply a tape recording that Coppola made of Nino Rota playing various tracks on piano and a bit about Carmine Coppola that amounts to an exercise in nepotism.  I still haven't learned what Carmine did to deserve sharing the Oscar with Nino Rota.  This feature could and should have had so much more.  Commentaries by other film composers would have been wonderful.  This feature is short and lame.6)  The Godfather Historical Timeline, Filmaker Profiles, Photo Galleries and Storyboards:  More padding.  Mainly text and stills.7)  Coppola's Notebook:  This is a sub-section  of the ""Making of.."" While interesting to see how the director annotated the novel and broke it down into sections and kept all his notes in a big binder that - if it had been lost - was to be returned to Paramount for reward money...how much more interesting it would have been to learn more about Puzo's creation of the characters and the research involved.On Disc 5, which is actually Disc 4, we find the following:1)  Godfather World:  A quick overview of the cultural impact of the films.  Mildly interesting - but it mainly focuses on spoofs, cartoons and ""The Sopranos.""  The deeper, darker aspects of its impact are not explored.  This is mainly fluff - whereas it could have been a truly heady discussion with alot of talking heads involved.  I would loved to have heard what the actual crime family members made of the trilogy. Did John Gotti dig it? I would like to have heard from folks who hated the movies, also.  The Godfather making its way into Homer Simpson's world is amusingly interesting, but there are deeper ways in which the films have impacted and even changed American and world culture.  Few films have such an impact.  In not analysing this impact on a more serious level, this featurette falters.2)  The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn't:  This details Coppola's studio struggles - which are most interesting - but, again, there is nothing about the initial Italian-American boycott of the making of the film.  It was a stiff opposition and a tale that should have been told herein.  Studio opposition to Brando is mentioned, and all of two seconds of Brando's impromptu screen test are shown - but this featurette (as well as ""Behind the Scenes"") really doesn't examine Brando's contribution in any profound detail.  It would have been wonderful to see how his performance shaped the film and how the film resurrected him.  Somewhere in these two discs of extras, more should have been said about Brando.  Very little is.3)  When the Shooting Stopped:  A brief look into some editing aspects.  Interesting, but not what I thought the title implied, and that was a  deeper look at immediate reactions and potential repurcussions to the crime families at the time.4)  Emulsion Recuse:  Technical tour of the restorations.  Interesting if you like tech-talk.5)  The Goddather on the Red Carpet:  Total garbage!  I thought this would have included coverage of the Oscar nights for all three installments of the Godfather saga, including the controvery surrounding Brando's win - and instead we get lame reactions about the impact the movie made on, of all people, the stars and makers of 'Cloverfield' while they stroll the red carpet.  Total padding, total nonsense.6)  Four Short Films: These are nothing more than more pointless padding.  One is a short discussion on the relative merits of GF I versus II; one is a stupid ""riffing"" on Godfather issues with two comedians that is mercifully short. Blink and you'll miss it.  The last two deal with cannolis and Clemenza and are just as pointless.On a whole, on the 1-10 scale, I would give the extras a 6.  They were good - but could have been much, much better.One last note on ""Godfather III"" which I had never seen until I bought this set:  at about the point of the helicopter attack on the assembled mafiosos, I half-expected to see James Bond enter the picture!  Also...some of the dialog in the film is hardly better than that in a soap opera - and some of it is unintentionally downright laughable. I also haven't seen such a dragged out ending (the opera house sequence) in years.  And it is all so confusing, this installment, and the death of Michael's daughter is so utterly contrived that I couldn't believe this film had been made by the same man responsible for I and II.  Anyway -  I saw the boxed gift set in a store and, what can I say, it was an offer I couldn't refuse."	2.0	Pros and Cons on the Extras	2009-01-25	11	6	5

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2PPTN3DTD8QNW	Rich Grace	This review is only for the Blu-Ray version. While The Godfather (which this review is chiefly concerned with) remains a towering achievement, with stunning consistencies of tone, a gripping narrative, and the sophisticated character arc of Michael Corleone, I wish I could say the Blu-Ray version tops everything. It doesn't. While colors are exceptionally rich and all scenes in the darkness of the Godfather's meeting rooms are finally truly viewable for the first time, you won't see a magical transformation to hi-def loveliness from the original film stock. Nothing can be done, for example, with the outdoor scenes, particularly the wedding and the scenes in L.A. I would recommend getting the Restoration DVDs instead and running them on a good upconverting player. I feel that the Blu-Ray version gilds the lily and doesn't add any value to what is already a masterpiece and one of the ten greatest films of all time. (Strangely enough, I half expected Tony Soprano to appear in the Five Families scenes! It just goes to show how seminal this movie really is.)	4.0	Five stars for the restoration and the story, four for the Blu-Ray	2008-12-08	5	3	2

This version jumps around so much it is an effort to keep it straight even knowing the story.  When Vito shoots Fanucci you can see his scar from having his throat slit, Hello!  The DVD's Rembrandt mood and lighting is stunning, and you can see Pentangeli's brother talking to Michael in the corner of the screen thanks to the 1:85 ratio. In the DVD's first 3 hours so far, I have seen a couple of clips I don't recall in the Trilogy;  where do these pieces pop up from?

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	The Godfather (Francis Ford Coppola, 1972)Put ten critics in a room and ask them what the best movie ever made is. At least seven of them will tell you it's The Godfather. (An eighth will tell you it's The Godfather Part II, but that's another review. The other two will come up with something way out of left field that you've never heard of, but is made of awesome anyway.) I first tried to watch The Godfather about twenty years ago and found it an unwatchable, unforgivably slow mess of a movie that became one of the handful (at best) of movies I turned off without finishing. With all the critical acclaim the movie continues to receive, however, I decided to go back and given it a second chance; I'm a lot more patient now than I used to be. In fact, this time I grabbed the entire extended trilogy boxed set form the library and watched all three films over the course of a week. I liked this one a whole lot better the second time around, to be sure, but I do still think it had its share of shortcomings.The Godfather was made (as, I assume, the novel was written) with an eye toward the epic; everything about this movie is bigger than life, from its Bollywood-esque running time (just shy of three hours) to its frankly jaw-dropping cast. It tells the story of the passing of the guard in the Corleone family from the aging patriarch, Vito (Marlon Brando), to one of his sons. (While I seriously doubt there's anyone who doesn't know the end, I won't give it away.) The thing is, all three of Vito's kids--Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale), and Michael (Al Pacino)--are in some way unsuitable for the role. Fredo is what we'd call these days a little slow (may, in fact, be mentally challenged); Sonny, the closest of the three to the old man, is loyal but wants to do things his way; and Michael wants to shake free of the family business entirely, to the point where he's enlisted in the army and found himself a non-Italian wife (Diane Keaton). In fact, things are so bad that Vito's even considering naming his adopted lieutenant, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), as the head of the family--and he's Irish. The fireworks erupt when the entire clan gets together for a wedding, and the gang warfare in the city, which has been in a state of uneasy truce for a while, swings back into high gear.The depth of acting talent in this movie is beyond compare. Brando, of course, had already won an Oscar (for On the Waterfront) and had been nominated for four more. Pacino would pick up an Oscar nomination for his role here, and would go on to nab six more nominations and a win (including being one of the very few actors to be nominated in two different categories in the same year). Caan picked up a nomination for his role here. Duvall picked up his first nomination here, and would go on to four more nominations and a win. Keaton would go on to an Oscar win and three more nominations. The only one of the main cast without an single Oscar nomination is John Cazale, who made only five films before his untimely death (but he did pick up a Golden Globe nomination for Dog Day Afternoon). And that's just the principal cast; we're not even getting into the incredible cast of supporting players (Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda, and Sterling Hayden are just the tip of the iceberg). It goes without saying that the acting here is stellar. Mario Puzo's script, adapted from his own novel, is well-done, but my complaint about the leisurely pace of the movie still stands (though not nearly as strongly as before); yes, there's a lot of character development here, but I don't see why it couldn't have been done in about two-thirds the time. It also helps to think of this less as an action film than as a character-driven family drama, but not like any family drama you'll ever see on the Lifetime Movie Network; this is family in all its bloody glory (and let's face it, the mafia stuff is nothing more than overblown allegory for the more intimate family dynamic here), and despite the incredible slowness, it's all fascinating.As I said about The Seven Samurai (above), I'm not saying The Godfather is a bad movie in any way (though I'll agree with that eighth critic that Part II is the slightly better movie). It is, in fact, a very good movie. But is it the best movie ever made? As I keep my own list of the 100 Best Movies Ever Made, and something else is at the top of it, the answer in my case should be obvious. But that doesn't mean it's bad. **** * *The Godfather, Part II (Francis Ford Coppola, 1974)[NOTE: this review necessarily contains spoilers for The Godfather. If you haven't seen that one and plan to, don't read this.]Where Francis Ford Coppola set out (as my hypothesis goes; see review of The Godfather above) with The Godfather to make an epic film, when he wrote the screenplay for The Godfather Part II, he set out to surpass epic and head into the realm of the immortal. And how does one do that, you ask? By taking an already amazing cast and adding one of the finest actors of his generation, Robert DeNiro. After all, when you're already the finest screenwriter on the planet (and Coppola had already proved that on several occasions, including screenplays for Patton and The Conversation), you've got Mario Puzo's writings to work from, and the first movie was widely hailed as a masterpiece, all you have to do is keep doing what you were doing before.Part II of the series interpolates scenes of Vito (De Niro) as a young man, showing how he became the man we saw in the first film, with present-day footage of Michael (Al Pacino) trying to clean up the mess left for him by Vito's death. The family is still in tatters, and things are only getting worse; his wife Kay (Diane Keaton) , originally part of the driving force behind Michael's decision to walk away from the family, is upset by his taking over, adding stress to his already fragile situation. In order to expand his empire, as well, Michael reaches out to Cuba, and its insane dictator Batista.It is rare for a sequel to surpass the original film it follows, and whether Part II does that is something that's been hotly debated by both critics and the public for decades. I'm one of those who thinks it does; we already know many of these characters, but that doesn't prevent Coppola from continuing to deepen our relationships with them (and them with each other), while adding in new characters and giving them the same treatment. As a result, this one's even longer than the first, running about three and a half hours. Unlike the first, however, Coppola had gotten into the groove of this thing and had a better handle on how it should be paced; this one has far fewer places where it drags. As well, while the first film is essentially plotless, just showing us the family in its decline, within the story of the family's rises to power, we get the story of Vito and his wife, which is a true masterpiece in every way. It could have been a film on its own.I'm sure you don't need me to tell you that The Godfather Part II is a great film; you've probably heard it from every critic you've ever read. Well worth seeing, even if you weren't thrilled with the first one. ***** * *The Godfather, Part III (Francis Ford Coppola, 1990)When it was originally released, Coppola's third (and, to date, final) entry in the Godfather series was almost universally panned, considered by most to be a case of a lot of those involved needing the money and capitalizing on the series name. In the intervening twenty years, however, perception of the film seems to have mellowed a good deal, and the good things about it have gotten more press; after all, despite its critical reception, the film was nominated for seven Oscars, and there's usually a reason for that.The action takes place (mostly) during the late seventies. Michael Corleone is approaching sixty, and feels tremendous guilt about the violence and mayhem his family was responsible for in previous decades, and he has turned the family business towards legitimate interests. The bulk of the movie deals with Michael's attempt to buy the Vatican's shares in a real estate holding company (the Vatican needs the money, while Corleone needs the legitimacy); all well and good, except Corleone's old mafia buddies also wantin on the deal, and are willing to go to great lengths to secure a part of it. Meanwhile, Michael's old bodygyard Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna), feeling slighted on the deal and an enemy of Michael's new prot&eacute;g&eacute; (Sonny's illegitimate son), declares war on the family he served for so long. Life is never tranquil in the world of the Corleones.Much of the criticism surrounding this movie, it always seemed to me, centered on the performance of Sophia Coppola. I don't think it deserved anywhere near the vituperation poured upon it. It's not that Coppola's performance is bad, it's that the Godfather series has always featured the kind of acting that makes a good performance look mediocre. There are some interestingly topical bits (like the ascension of Pope John Paul I) that haven't aged terribly well, but anyone old enough to have been alive during that time should have no problem with it. I enjoyed it just as much as the first one. ***	4.0	Excellent, but best movies ever...?	2009-07-28	1	1	0
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ	Robert Blake	Probably the two best known trilogies in the history of cinema are the &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy and &quot;The Godfather&quot; trilogy. To look at all three films by Francis Ford Coppola is to look at three  examples of great cinema, of great acting and composition. The first  &quot;Godfather&quot; is a true masterpiece, full of so many characters and  such a moving story. Marlon Brando is unforgettable in probably his best  role. It's also a great parable on the son taking over for the father, of a  bloody family tradition being passed down the generations. And the funny  thing is, even the son who didn't want anything to do with the family  business, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), is eventually the one who ends up  commanding it. &quot;The Godfather Part 2&quot; is a brilliant look at both  the father and son at the same age. Coppola shows us the rise of Michael as  a ruthless mafia don and the ascendance of Don Vito from part 1 in the 20s  as a crime boss as well. Coppola nicely balances both, and created a weird  moving experience. The movie is elegantly mounted and goes out further than  the first one, even takes us to Cuba where Michael flees the night of  Castro's takeover. Everything from the sets, suits and music is rich. And  the ending is haunting.  &quot;The Godfather Part 3&quot; finalizes the  saga as we see Michael as an old man, already tired of the violence and  wants to legitimize his family. But the past is seductive, and Michael is  pulled back in. This movie is rich in cinematography and music. It has a  lot of style and great performances by Pacino and Andy Garcia as the  trigger happy Vincent. The movie is haunting in it's own way, and exciting.  It's great to watch this and connect it's threads with the other two. With  part 3 &quot;The Godfather&quot; series ends on the right note. Every film  in this collection is a masterpiece and Coppola's best work. It's an  example of true cinema.	5.0	One Sweeping Epic.	2000-05-04	31	29	2

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A26JGAM6GZMM4V	Robert Morris	Is this a prequel or a sequel? In some ways, both. What we have here is a film which provides essential background information about Vito Corleone who later became a crime family don (played by Marlon Brando in The Godfather) and a continuation of the saga as Michael succeeds his father as don and proceeds with plans to involve his family only in legitimate enterprises. One of the several reasons that Coppola received an Academy Award for best director and The Godfather Part II received an Academy Award as best film is his brilliant use of cross-cuts. (Obviously, they were eliminated in the made-for-television The Godfather Saga in 1977 which rearranges the two films' narrative within a chronological order.) My own opinion is that this film is the equal of The Godfather but they are, stand alone, masterpieces. Special credit is due cinematographer Gordon Willis who uses sepia-tone to present what seem like almost home movies of young Vito and his family...but then, when shooting events at Lake Tahoe compound and in Cuba, the action is presented with a contemporary look.The focal point of much of the film is the relationship between Michael and Hyman Roth (Strasberg) as they develop their partnership in Cuba. The negotiations are juxtaposed, indeed intertwined with Michael's strained relationship with his older brother Fredo (John Casale). Almost but not quite lost in all this are Michael's deteriorating relationships with his sister Connie (Talia Shire), Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and eventually with just about everyone. As the film ends, Michael is alone in just about every possible way.As to my favorite scenes, there are several which include Michael's conversation with Roth on the balcony (during the celebration of Roth's birthday) when Michael shares his recent experience on a street in Havana, later when he confronts insecure Fredo with betraying him (Michael) and the Corleone family, and when Tessio (Abe Vigoda) approaches Michael during the burial of his father and later when Tessio appeals for his life, and even later when Michael looks out the window of his compound on Lake Tahoe, perhaps recalling happier moments in his past. When Michael offered to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey, he began a rite of passage after which he was ordained (if that's the right word) to  a fate his father never wished for him. When this great film ends, Michael seems empty...without any redeeming humanity...resigned to accept what he felt required to do and is therefore somehow fulfilled.	5.0	On Godfather Part II	2003-07-21	3	3	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8	Roger J. Buffington	I consider The Godfather to be the greatest film of all time, and I saw it in the theater the first week it was released.  At the time we were all struck by the beautiful cinematography -- the sun-drenched scenes in Sicily, the fall colors of New England.  When The Godfather came out on DVD I was subtly disappointed because the quality of the reproduction simply was not up to par.  Not terrible, mind you, but not up to the standard of the theatrical release.This restoration goes a long way towards restoring the magic of the original release.  I cannot say for sure that it gets us all the way there, but it is a striking improvement. The colors are warm and vibrant, and there are few dust specs or flaws of that type. I am imagining that this is about the best that we can do, given that the film was originally released in the early 1970s.I was sorry to see that a few scenes from the original theatrical release are not included here, in common with the earlier DVD releases.  Nothing major, but a few scenes from Tom Hagan's confrontation with Jack Woltz, scenes of Michael with Kay Adams, and perhaps a few others, are simply gone.  I was hoping that they would be here.  I have seen them a few times on television, but never on DVD.  Too bad.Well worth having and enjoying.  Highly recommended.

I was looking forward to the clear and sharp window like picture of today's blu-ray's. But as I watched The Godfather I realised this is the perfect picture for the movie. Most of all the colors pop with such a variety of dark colors and the blacks are real blacks and not the gray's with alot of noise in the dvd collection. I laughed when I saw the Mo Green hit. Me and my friend always made fun of it and now it is a brutal execution. Before it was a watery light pink that ran from his eye. Now it is darkened and even seems to have a thicker texture to it. The audio is crisp and keeps the original mostly front channel sound. The whole perpus of the restoration is not to make it the perfect picture, but to make it the perfect viewing exerience of the Godfather. And even though its not as sharp as the current blu-rays it is a vast improvement. Any True Godfather fan will make the upgrade.	5.0	Mo Green goses blood and it's not cranberry juice!	2008-09-27	7	5	2

Gorgeously shot, and full  of remarkable acting, music, costuming, sets, these films define America's  development throughout the first half of the 20th century by concentrating  on the details in one crime family's growth.  Wow.  Though Part III suffers  from the miscasting of Sofia Coppola, who gives it her best shot, it still  holds up, filled with those grand, swirling sequences that combine violence  and art so imaginatively.  I think the second part, with DeNiro and Pacino  starring, is the most richly observed, and covers the broadest canvas the  most effortlessly.  However, seen as a gigantic whole, you will be  overwhelmed by the stories told, and by how well they are told.  It is a  work of lasting power and true vision.

The only thing that I don't understand is how some people could call godfather 3 the worse. It ended the trilogy, and the way it ended, it was an emotionaly cinamatic moment.(If you haven't seen the movie don't read this last part.)  At the end, everyone thought that they were going to kill Mike, but instead they killed his daughter, who would have expected that to happen. And the, it shows him sitting alone in Sicily and he dies. his first wife was murdered in Sicily and so was his daughter. This left him alone, he died without anyone by his side.

The sound and picture are excellent and the movie just looks great.  As for the bonus material, I hope you have a few hours to waste, because this this is filled to the rim with bells and whistles.  My only knock is the The Godfather Part II, is on two discs, but considering the movie is 3 1/2 hours long it might be understandable, but I figured they could have jammed it onto one disc by dual layering.  Other than that small complaint this is a great box set and should be a must in anyone's DVD collection.	5.0	I'm making a review you can't refuse.	2001-10-21	0	0	0
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A13OMT8D4GPIBV	Ryan Rogers	The Godfather contains two of the greatest movies ever made and one extremely well done follow-up.  The first movie contains, arguably, the best cast ever.  Marlon Brando, James Caan, Al Pacino, John Cazale, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall.  This alone is worth the price.  It's famous and still exciting with a near three hour runtime.The second film builds on where the first left off and is my favorite in the series.  Robert De Niro adds to the cast but Marlon Brando does not return and James Caan is only seen in a flashback.  The contrast of Vito's rise to power and Michael loss is wonderfully scripted, acted, and directed.  Vito's scenes alone could be an excellent movie.The third features Michael, an old man, trying to keep a hold on his business, and family with the ever changing times.  Robert Duvall is no longer there, but Andy Garcia plays the most of his part.  Some of the third movie's casting choices are a problem but it is still a very enjoyable, well acted, directed movie.The fourth disc is the real thing here.  The many featurettes, additional scenes, and Coppola's notes are what pushes this product past the single discs.  It definitely a must have for the three movies alone, but the additional disc makes it a must buy right now.  If you don't have this you are missing out on one of the best, if not the best, movies off all time.Definite Must Have.	5.0	Francis Ford Coppola's Epic Mafia Saga	2007-09-21	0	0	0

There's not a lot to say about a movie that has been written about for decades in one form or another.The transer to blu-ray is amazing and really does the movie justice especially in the darker parts of the film.  This was Coppola's masterpiece and you can tell they took the time to make it look as good as possible.  They added a few special features in 2008 that wasn't in some of the past release of the Trilogy, and with those, there is A LOT to look forward to if you're a fan of the films, or even film in general.  This might be the most complete release of the movies that we will get, I don't know how anyone can be unhappy with their purchase.  Oh, and definitely don't miss out on the wonderful commentaries by Coppola himself if you're into that kind of thing.	5.0	Greatest Film Trilogy Ever?	2012-10-08	2	2	0

I am glad that Amazon put these in a gold box special so I was able to buy them at a discounted and great price!  They look great on my 55&#34; Vizio tv and sound great on my Yamaha receiver and Mirage surround sound speakers.  I did notice that some of the sound is off a little on a few scenes, but that is from the dubbing in the studio, at least I am pretty sure that is what it is from.  But it doesn't happen all the time and isn't a major distraction that it ruins the experience of watching these classic movies.  And of course I mean the first and second godfathers being the classics.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A12YGP4B1UVI67	"Sandra Flickstein ""Grannysand"""	The only problem with this collection is that its viewers grow to love and admire characters who are doomed to hellfire, if such punishment exists for those who cause suffering to others.  And these gangsters create abominable suffering on a large scale.  Too often we are shown the personal lives and feelings and families of the men who commit atrocities, and we recognize qualities which are sympathetic, even sadmirable.  Make no mistake, however.  The aforementioned being the case this collection contains, perhaps, the greates movie ever made(I), another movie of incredible magnitude(II), and a third which is very good.

Doyle	The DVD quality of the trilogy is excellent to say the least and granted parts 1 and 2 are definitely in anyones top ten all time best,and contrary to most critics part 3 is in my opinion a very well crafted movie and deserving of a place in the top ten best of the 90,s.  My arguement is that the deleted scenes should have been inserted into the movies proper as unlike other movies these scenes are important to the story and should not be left as an extra.  I dont agree with those so called purists that the chronological edition is inferior,as a matter of fact I think it is superior and hopefully in the future Coppola can find the time and sources to release this option on DVD.  I would welcome it rather than the horrible rumour of a Godfather part 4.......Thats an offer I would refuse!	4.0	Great Movies,Poor extras	2003-10-24	0	0	0
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3U3W7URZU9259	"Seand67 ""chakasworld"""	Yes, this 'The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration' set is visually stunning and the 5.1 surround sound is great, BUT they clipped small portions out of the original movie(s). Especially on the 'Godfather II', where various scenes have been deleted & edited so that the movie could be compressed onto a single DVD. I knew it was too good to be true when reading the package details and regret selling my previous 'Godfather' box set. As for the new bonus material, I enjoyed most of it (some of it is useless FLUFF!), but all of the extras could've been placed on a single disc.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1R9GZ8FC44MF5	"Sean ""Dragon Ninja"""	The Godfather Part 1.The best of the trilogy, its got a great performance from Brando and most of the other guys, its got all the great mob action like the horse head and sleeping with the fishes and a bunch of hits, its got drama a very sad ending, and its definetly the best mafia movie ever, it will never be surpassed.Part 2.My least favortie, but still a very good movie.  It focuses too much on politics, and not enough on the family and the business.  The most interesting parts are the flashbacks with Vito, played by De Niro, all the good mob stuff happens in these parts, everything with Michael is politics this and politics that and im gonna kill my brother whcih was sad but necessary.  Part 1 is the best this one is actually the worst in the trilogy in my opinion.Part 3.Better then part 2, not as good as part 1.  A more dramatic story then part 2 with lots of cool hits, and a sad ending, in fact most of this movies is sad, lots of bad things happen.  It sums up everything very well, and overall is the second best movie of the trilogy.This trilogy is one of the best ever, Part 1 is the best, but the other 2 are still better then any other mafia movie, if you enjoy mafia movies and you dont have this you will wake up with a present from me, or you wont wake up at all.  10 out of a 10.	5.0	An offer you can't refuse.	2004-08-15	4	2	2
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2665DJK0LZ0Z2	"Sean Greer ""GA Fan"""	We have enjoyed the Godfather saga ever since it first came out in the 1970s. A young Al Pacino made his mark in this movie and we think that it was one of the roles that enabled to go as far as he has. Also, as a part of our family is from New Jersey, the period scenes of Ellis Island and New York City lets us remember what it was like growing up in that time and lets our family's new generation learn about it too. We have had the collection on VHS for some time, but the opportunity to have it on DVD was too good to pass up. The price was excellent as well, considering that it's all the movies plus the fourth DVD with the behind the scenes stuff.This is a collection we'd reccomend to any Godfather fan	5.0	Really Wanted This!	2006-08-13	4	4	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2X3IT1PUWYMQY	Sean L.	"Before I go into detail about this DVD collection, I would like to say what an outrage it is that THE GODFATHER PART III has not gotten any of the credit it deserves. For the third Godfather has the most emotional depth out of the three, and also, while not being the best in the series (that honor belongs to PART II), it is superior in many ways to the original two films. The last 15 minutes is a tragic, bloody, Shakespearean ending with a strong message. Also the conspiracy theory involving the Vatican is a nice touch. Give this film a chance. The people who put it down probably never even saw it all the way through.This DVD collection has a total of 5 discs. Don't be alarmed when you see that the first four have no extras except audio options and a chapter index. The real Bonus Material bounty is in the fifth disc, which contains a horde of extras mentioned in Amazon's summary. There's even a funny little easter egg hidden on the disc which allows you to hear ""Bada-bing-bada-boom"" in several different languages.The first Godfather is a classic. Marlon Brando with his cottonball-amplified mouth as Vito Corleone, all the memorable scenes, and, most importantly, our first introduction to the Corleone family. The story begins in the late 40's where a man named Sollozzo offers the family an investment in the dangerous new business of drugs. Vito Corleone turns the offer down, fearing that he would lose respect and power if he took to such a scheme, but lives to regret it. Things start to twist until the point where you'll be surprised how things turned out in the end.The second is a bit more complicated. Acting as both a prequel and a sequel to the original, there are scenes spliced together taking place both before and after the events of the 1972 GODFATHER. We learn how young Vito fled from Sicily to evade a ruthless gangster, and came to save a community from the clutches of a tyrant. Meanwhile, Michale Corleone is struggling to battle both an inside attack on the family as well as a senate hearing against his family and his father's name. The longest of the series by a longshot, but also digs the deepest. The time goes by in a flash leaving you the desire to see it again, a rare trait of such a long film.This boxset is a great gift for any fan/casual viewer/newcomer of the Godfather series. It is true that III chooses a different style than the others, but it is marvelous in its own rights and deserves a better reputation than the one it was so cruelly thrown upon."	5.0	Part III is a masterpiece, contrary to popular belief.	2002-06-15	8	6	2
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1VL8IA8L42UK5	Sean Price	&quot;I believe in America...&quot; the opening line of a film that made motion picture history with it's portrayal of family, love, honour, loyalty and vengeance. If anybody ever had a doubt about how good a director Francis Ford Coppola is, then this package will prove how good he is. The first movie made stars out of Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall and showed the world that if Marlon Brando had never appeared in On the Waterfront, The Wild One or A Streetcar Named Desire, the The Godfather was HIS role. This DVD package is nothing short of superb, five discs, Part I,II(2 discs), Part III &amp; a fifth disc full of all the extras you would want to see. The commentaries from FFC in all 3 movies is informative and interesting. In Part I the horse's head sequence and the murder of Solozzo/McClusky still shocks.STOP READING, BUY, WATCH and DIGEST the GREATEST movie of all time.	5.0	The DVD of the Year	2001-10-20	0	0	0

Since the movie was made before all of the new recording innovations this version seems to try to push the film image further than it was designed to go.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2E0L32S7QXADK	Shael Stonebridge	Are the Godfather films perfect?  NO!  Do they comprise the best movie trilogy of all time to date?  YES!Are these films about power, greed and ruthlessness?  YES, but they are more about &quot;necessity&quot;.  Michael Corleone discovers that he is NOT in control of his destiny and that it is necessary for him to do certain things, certain diabolical things, just to survive!Michael is not the author of his situation, he did not deal himself the cards which he finds himself holding.  He must play these cards correctly, just to live.  He could act differently, he could act more conventionally moral, but then he and his family would not be around to even have the chance to change things in the future.  Survival is after all fundamental!  If you are not here then all else is MOOT.&quot;The majority of men lead lives of quiet desperation&quot;, said Emerson.  These movies encapsulate this crushing reality like no others!I unreservedly include Godfather 3 in the above remarks.  For me it is a wholly fitting conclusion to the saga.  Is Michael redeemed?  NO, he simply endures a terrible loss and dies alone and ignominiously.	5.0	The Godfather of ALL Movie Trilogies	2001-10-05	1	1	0

In my opinion, The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time.  The Godfather part II is also in the top 5 greatest of all-time, while the third may be in the top 50.The Godfather is clearly Francis Ford Coppola's best work along with Mario Puzo.  This movie displays an organized crime family like no other.  It starts out with a brilliant wedding scene and shows the Godfather, Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando), carrying out an old tradition of listening and agreeing to do favors for friends since it is the day of his daughter's wedding.  Later in the movie Vito is shot and nearly killed, which is when Micheal Corleone (Al Pacino) begins his journey to the top of his family.  The movie is full of great mob hits an there isn't a dull moment.  I really love when Micheal travels to Sicily and explores his roots.The second film is set up in a different format, going back in forth from the past to the present.  In this film, a young Robert De Niro plays a young Vito Corleone.  Although this takes away a lot of Pacino's screen time it is brilliant.  Robert De Niro steals the screen playing young Vito and showing his rise to a mafia boss.  In this movie Micheal is almost killed which leads to him playing cat and mouse, trying to find out who did it.  Then there is the alternate story line with De Niro.  Over all this movie is just as good as the first.Now we come to the third installment of the Godfather series.  This film is not nearly as strong or moving as the first two, but still very good.  It is hard to appreciate it after watching the first two Godfather movies since those two will make any movie look bad.  This movie is more slow-paced and depressing.  A much older Al Pacino returns to play Micheal Corleone.  Instead of dealing with other big bosses, drug deals, or casinos, Micheal chooses to get into business with the Vatican.  What really hurts this movie is the relationship between Micheal's daughter and Micheal's former brother SOnny's bastard son.  This kind of grosses you out since you know there cousins but other than that everything is great.There is a fifth disk in this collection with tons of extras, some of the best I've ever seen on a DVD.  There are hours of documentaries with all of the actors and crew.If you are a movie fan and collector then you must have The Godfather DVD Collection.

These people must be blind or have a terrible monitor. I also own the DVD Godfather Collection and I did a comparison on my Sharp 70"" Aquos (which is one awesome looking HD tv) and the difference between the blu-ray and DVD is outstanding! The DVD color is washed out, whereas the blu-ray color is vibrant and alive! I honestly could not believe the difference. It was shocking how bad the DVD looked. I know that regular DVD's can look bad on large flat screens, even with the upconverter players, but this was unbelievable. The DVD was dull looking and very grainy. The blu-ray brings clarity to the picture. I know the DVD probably looks good on a smaller HD tv but it looks absolutely horrible on a 70"". By the same token, blu-ray practically looks 3D on the newer large screens that are not 3D.There is some grain still on parts of the blu-ray on Godfather 1, but it is 10 times worse on the DVD so I was not upset with that. The movie is 40 years old.....only so much you can do with it, to be sure. Only thing I wasn't so impressed with was the new 5.1 sound....it was a little hollow and needed some bass. Again, 40 years old. Godfather 3 looked stunning, picture-wise, no grain at all.Definitely worth the money if you are a fan. And I'm not sure what all this talk is about it being in 4:3 ratio. Mine was not and the format is not 2.35:1, nor is it advertised as that. It actually just says ""letterboxed"". But in any case, the correct ratio for these movies is 1.85:1, which fills a widescreen tv without stretching or zooming. Perhaps the tv aspect was set wrong."	5.0	Stunning Blu-Ray Restoration	2012-03-16	2	2	0

The first two films are two of greatest films ever made. Indeed The Godfather is ranked No.1 and The Godfather II is ranked No.3 in the IMDB.com rankings as of today. Bare in mind that these films were made over 30 years ago and that is some achievement.Part 3 is not a bad film, and by normal film standards is pretty good. However in comparison with the first two its not in the same class, and doesn't merit repeated viewings in the same way as 1 & 2.The bonus disc contains a lot of interesting stuff:Behind the Scenes (on location, music, screenwriting, auditions, storyboards, cinematography etc),Additional ScenesFamily TreesTrailersAcademy Award speeches!Biographies.If that doesn't convince you that you're getting good value for money, then perhaps when I tell you the total running time of all 5 discs is 710mins will (thats almost 12hours).

The main advantage of getting the full collection instead of just buying &#34;The Godfather&#34; and &#34;The Godfather, Part II&#34; is the fourth disc of features and extras, which are not included in the stand-alone Blu Rays.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1K2DRD9FJL0ZN	"""sjsquidly"""	Perhaps the only true criticism being offered out there that may have some merit is how this 5 disk set is in the original form, versus the Godfather Epic, which combined 1&amp;2, allowing for a sense of chronological order. In all honesty, I don't mind or care. A person can make a case either way about how the Epic was worked out nicely, featuring De Niro as Young Vicente, then Brando, then Pacino takes over the Family business. But in arguing the notion of preservation director's intent, or the original way the film was made, this is a nice way to see the trilogy. It is also the first way I ever witnessed the films.I am very pleased to see all of the bonuses that have been added to compliment such a great piece of cinematic achievemnt. The deleted scenes, Oscar acceptances (Brando's non-acceptance, rather), commentaries and the others, it will add to the old fan and new fan's knowledge of one of the great films of all time.I must admit, Godfather III was never high on my list, but the first one was always a work to be cherished, the second another to be remembered. If you like these, I also highly recommend Goodfellas (which would be nice if Scorsese offered some commentary).	5.0	An Essential Piece for ANY DVD Collection	2001-09-28	7	6	1

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2JFR7SF0KZ73T	Sophia	The Godfather Trilogy has got to be, without a doubt, the greatest film epic of this genre.  The performances turned in by the seasoned actors and actresses are stellar.  The screen adaptation is superb.  The added &quot;goodies&quot; on the DVD version are a joy for anyone who loved the original films.  Godfather I and II are magnificent while part III is a bit weaker it's still wonderful in that it ties up all the ends and makes for a fantastic finale. Having grown up on the classic &quot;gangster&quot; films of Bogart, Cagney, and Raft and loving every minute of them I still have to cast my vote for The Godfather Trilogy as my all time favourite &quot;gangster&quot; film.  The Saga of the Corleone Family is one that I never tire of watching.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3R8PXSFGY9MC2	Spider Monkey	'The Godfather Trilogy' is epic filmmaking at it's best. You get to see incredible actors portraying the intrigue, betrayal and inner machinations of mafia life from the early 20th century through three generations. The story is spell binding and gripping and the direction is superb. I'll say what everyone says and that is, G1 is brilliant, G2 is a great sequel that adds to the story and understanding of the corleone family and G3 is hmmmm, well, a disappointment. Don't expect too much from it and you'll be ok. Buy the boxset for the extras and to own a slice of movie history, it is often classed as the best trilogy out there, and with some justification.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.	5.0	The Godfather	2011-01-09	0	0	0

There is the fight for territory among the crime leaders and enough brutal killing to satisfy ones lust for blood.  The nice thing is that most, if not all those killed are the gang members themselves.  In the end we find that crime does not pay and it does not end well for the godfather.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AD4RZ4DSMPBF6	Stefan	The Blu-ray version of The Godfather Collection is amazing. If you are expecting crystal clarity like a new movie, you won't be impressed. However, if you've seen The Godfather through the years from VHS to DVD and then on Blu-ray..... you will be impressed. The colors are much more vivid and the film itself is much more clear than any previous versions of the film. Its like watching a whole new movie, Seriously. The extras disc is awesome too. Because finally you get most, if not all, of the extra footage that was in The Godfather Saga. I highly recommend The Godfather Collection on Blu-Ray.	5.0	Awesome.	2013-02-22	0	0	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS	Stephen M. Lerch	So not all of the Godfather movies are &#34;great,&#34; but I think each film does deserve to be seen. The Coppola Restoration makes this set the best these films have ever looked and sounded.Video:Each film is presented on its own disc. This means all extraneous materials are left off of the discs to provide the maximum amount of storage space for higher quality audio and video.Video is 1080p AVC encoded. Each film has been meticulously restored and only on occasion can you find something they might have missed or not been able to clean up.Audio:Dolby True HD 5.1 encoded. Unfortunately the original mix wasn't a surround mix, and as the films are mainly dialog driven, your speakers won't get much of a workout.What is presented is the cleanest, sharpest audio ever available for these films, bar none.Extras:You get all of the extras from the original DVD collection (in SD), then quite a few more in HD (1080i). Commentaries, restoration clips, and tons of featurettes. There are hours and hours of extras here and I haven't made it through them all. Everything I've watched so far helps gain a new perspective on the films and/or how they came to be, so from that perspective, if you're interested in that sort of thing, it's definitely worthwhile.Overall:Even though I'm not a huge fan of the second and third films, they are worth seeing. And with the amount of love and care that went into the Blu Ray set, it's highly recommended.	5.0	Good collection	2013-02-24	0	0	0
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2RG6V2HH02U0M	Stephen Pellerine	"Not only is this such a classic, but it penetrates a stage that I think many cultures feel at some point in time - if expressed differently. Hundreds of years ago in Japan the samurai elite could have been classified as the ruling families and strutted power to retain control at the top. Even today the modern Yakuza continue their Japanese mafia leadership ""if"" away from the limelight of the status quo - but the fact is, they exist. Then the classic stereotypical mafias as depicted in these films. Today modern cases could be seen in the Middle East as families reign nations without question, or very little that makes it public. People know the consequences.I love the series as simply a great series, but also link it to stages societies ""may"" go through in various ways. I understand there are some technical issues with this box set so be cautious here in what you order (see 1 ratings below). But even the 1 ratings do not go against the overall movie - it appears as people really appreciate it.Be aware this is about the mafia and is far removed from Disney genres. Tarzan does not come swinging out of the trees and save people here at the last second - often scenes that appear they will end violently, end violently. So of you 1) like this genre and have not seen this series give it a go and get ready to see a classic set, or 2) if you have an interest in thinking about society and possible transitions they go through - I think the anthropologist within can also be satisfied."	5.0	the anthropologist within	2010-12-19	0	0	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1FNES0QEBJZD1	Steve Douglas	"I have and love my Standard DVD Godfather collection but would someone please explain why reviewers here do not mention the quality of the Blu Ray transfer for both audio and video.  Why is it that so many focus on plot summary, acting good or bad, and whether their father liked the movie so they bought it for them.  All that is irrelevant.  I need to know, regardless of the which movie is being reviewed, about the transfer quality.  Why is this collection transferred as a lossy audio""?  Are the surrounds properly used and is the video transfer really any better on Blu Ray or is it Standard Def transcoded to Blu Ray without improving the quality?Why can't Amazon separate the Blu Ray reviews from the Standard Def reviews?Why are the 'most helpful' positive and negative always 8 year old reviews?  Can't they use a recent review to highlight the movie as there may have been upgrades and updates since the initial release.If Amazon movie reviews are going to be helpful, lets stop the nonsense plot summaries and talk about the quality of the discs themselves.Sorry for the rant but this is how I feel.4/4/2013I realize that no one will probably now see this since it has been buried under a myriad number of streaming reviews and other people's summaries but I received the blu ray collection and have just finished watching the last film.There is no question in my mind that we have a great restoration with this collection and a gorgeous restoration, especially, of the first two film.  For all 3 movies there is a warm coloration even in the very deliberately darker scenes and they successfully reached a true black 0 IRE for those whose systems can demonstrate the collection's excellence. There remains the low level film grain and soft focus that you don't see in too many modern movies.In Godfather 1 the lossless True HD is clear with very perfectly set audio levels.  There is some use of the discreet channels for foley effects but not much though some panning across the front stage is present.  For the most part, your surrounds are used for ambience at low levels.Godfather 11's lossless audio continues in that vein with some very nice pans and speaker directionality but , again, most everything will be through your center speaker.  The soundtracks, however, have a nice even spread across the stage.Godfather 3 is the one most panned and yet I never found it bad at all.  Like the other 2, it retains the warm, golden coloration and film grain and the lossless audio remains in the front and, again, mostly through the center channel.The extras disc contains a great number of deleted scenes, some broadcast on TV but were not included in the theatrical releases, and some I do not recall seeing before.  All the commentaries and extras from the 2001 collection release are included as well as a very worthy bunch of new extras, making this collection that much more valuable. One great extra was the 'Emulsional Rescue' which discusses and demonstrates how the restoration was done.In my opinion, this collection is a very worthy purchase and I hope this review has been of some help."	5.0	The Godfather, the Coppola Restoration, on Blu Ray.	2012-06-02	7	7	0

In spite of Sofia Coppola's performance, (which was awful), I felt it was a very good movie! Apparently, Winona Ryder dropped out at the last minute. Anyway, it received mostly positive reviews from critics, and was also nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture!Besides Sofia Coppola being a low point, the movie was definitely missing Robert Duvall, who demanded a salary comparable to Pacino's.

Its auteur director, Coppola, laced it with the subtlest Leftist message that may have avoided the radar of even longtime fans who have seen the film 10 or more times.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A27IRTZMV0LW45	Steve Sensoli	Francis Ford Coppla shows how great movies are made. The first 2 Godfather movies are one of my favorite movies of all time! Its pretty amazing at how good the Godfather was when it came out in 1972. Al Pacino, James Cann and Robert Deniro and many others show their acting ability in these movies. These movies have done a lot for many people and have made them very well known. This movie is also special to my heart because its Al Pacino first big movie and does such a great job. Even though the 3rd Godfather wasn't as good as the other movies, It was still good. Overall, this is a great trilogy and shows great acting throughtout the movies!	5.0	The Best Mob Movies Ever!	2002-05-20	6	3	3

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3UMC7TLQSUK25	"Stewart Axelrad ""sunbard"""	I thought that I would write a follow-up review to the one I previously submitted, back in July 2001, before this box set was released. Having purchased and viewed the entire set (and there's a lot of bonus materials, folks, enough to fill a whole evening), I want to share my enthusiasm with you. First of all, the ditigal transfer is amazing on all 3 films. It is difficult to appreciate the improved picture and audio quality unless one views the old VHS version, side-by-side with this edition. Trust me, there's no comparison. As for the films themselves, well, you wouldn't be reading this review if you aren't a Godfather fanatic like I am. Even GIII is an entertaining finale to the trilogy, even if some of the acting sucks, the dialogue is cliche-ridden, and most of the characters are two-dimensional (with the exception of Pacino, of course; he makes the best ofmediocre dialogue). Normally, I don't care for commentary tracks, because it's difficult to watch the movie (and hear the dialogue) while some disembodied voice is explaining this or that scene. But Coppola's commentary is truly entertaining, with many humerous anecdotes about Brando, et al and behind-the- scenes revelations about his near-firing from Paramount on the first film. I watched all 3 films a second time, just to listen to his commentary. The deleted scenes (and there are a lot of them) were great; one wishes that they had been included in the orginal release. There are 2 full-length featurettes, with short appearances with some of the actors, such as James Caan and Talia Shire. All in all, this set is well worth the bucks, and should be in the collection of any serious student of film. Happy viewing!!	5.0	A Classy Box Set,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,	2001-11-09	4	4	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A29CN2BN65FFAL	Strontium	I will start by saying that, overall, the quality is 'okay'.  However, I don't have many good things to say about this set.Firstly, there are two scenes (and I'm only 1/2 way through II) where someone was asleep, apparently, on the QA team.Specifically, in part I, the scene where Michael confronts the baker in the hospital...Did they just decide to not touch that scene?Secondly, in part II, there is a scene where all of the locals in Cuba are throwing televisions on the ground...etc... after the President steps down.  Right after the image of Corleone's plane preparing for takeoff.  There is some unidentifiable CRAP on the screen...If this is what passes for 'quality', I'll pass.  Either I must've gotten a bad copy or someone just rushed this crap out the door.And, another poster hit the nail on the head with the color issues.  I feel like I'm living in a tangerine hell.0 out of 5, for this piece of shoddy 'money is the whole reason' atrocity.Site won't allow zero stars...

The bonus disk talks about how much time and trouble they went through to restore the film.Too bad my VHS copy looks better!Now I know why it was only $18 on Amazon - because only Coppolla has the brand spanking new bluray player required to view this presentation properly!BUYER BEWARE.  My newest player is only two or three years old and it wouldn't play these disks to their fullest potential.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AMWFJLNUGS5D3	Sugunan	We all know that the first two films are the real masterpieces. But what really surprised me when I watched Part III recently is how good it really is. Sure, it isn't in the same level as its predecessors, but I cannot agree with the people who have panned this movie as terrible. The one big flaw in the movie is the casting of Sophia Coppola as Al pacino's daughter. Her gawkiness on screen makes her love affair with Andy Garcia totally unconvincing; one cannot believe Andy actually sheds tears at the break-up; and when she dies at the end, so emotionally disconnected is the viewer from this character that we wonder what the parents are howling about at the opera-house steps. The rest of the movie, however, is very good indeed and fully deserves its Oscar nomination. The script is well-written; Micheal's character is made more subtle and more tragic; there is great emotional resonance between Micheal and Kay, and between Micheal and Vincent; the veteran actors all give fine performances; and the drawn-out finale is superb. Overall, the movie engages you from start to finish and, though certainly not a masterpiece, is nonetheless a fitting conclusion to this grand American tragedy. So go ahead, buy this collection, and enjoy all three movies again and again.	5.0	Part III is a fitting conclusion	2001-10-25	0	0	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2M1MNG7G40V85	Surface to Air Missle	It seems rediculous to me that they won't sell these as individual units and it is not like they don't stand alone nicely bythemselves.No need to talk about the movie but the DVD features are pretty nice.  Coppola's commentary is a nice change from the usual self congratulatory fluff we often get.  Also am I alone in liking one person commentaries?  The making of feature is decent but and the family tree will help the Godbabies out.Sometimes I feel the nostalgic hype has outpaced the actual film but it stil holds up today even though the idea of the &quot;mob&quot; has been pretty much played out.  Are we supposed to like Mikey as he goes through his change?  Also it makes me sad to see Al Pacino in such amazing form as it reminds me of those people who &quot;peaked in 6th grade&quot;.  Yes he has had many fine perfomances since but how could you do better than Godfather II?  Also no matter what anyone says, Godfather III is not a good movie!!

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A256QKS1DIQ54U	T. Bollinger	There are films, and then there are motion picture experiences. These experiences can change you, alter the way you think about things, and they have the ability to leave a mark on your memory that burns long after you left the theatre or turned off your television set. &#8216;The Godfather&#8217; is one of those life-changing motion pictures. Directed by film legend Francis Ford Coppola (&#8216;The Godfather&#8217; Trilogy, Apocalypse Now&#8217;), this movie is impossible to summarize in way that does justice to the benchmarks it set for American cinema and cinema worldwide. Its influence on the filming industry and the impact it has had on popular culture is simply massive. It has some of the most quotable lines in all of cinema and some of the most memorable scenes ever shot. Truly, there is, and never will be, anything quite like it.As funny and exciting as it is dark and brooding, &#8216;The Godfather&#8217; is as close to flawless as any film has gets. The core of its strength lies in the writing, and in the character analysis of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and the tragic arc of his son, Michael (Al Pacino). Brando, in unquestionably is most famous role among a lifetime of legendary performances (&#8216;A Streetcar Named Desire, &#8216;Last Tango in Paris,&#8217; &#8216;On the Waterfront,&#8217; &#8216;Apocalypse Now&#8217;), is a towering figure in this film. His character is extremely versatile, capable of being ruthless, intimidating, and powerful, while also showing vulnerability and compassionate. He is unquestionably the face of this movie, and has its most famous lines. As for Al Pacino&#8217;s character, Michael Corleone, he is the protagonist that guides the audience through the story, and it is his ark that the viewers feel and experience. And man, what an arc it is. There are very few character transformations more emotional and effective than Pacino&#8217;s in this movie. It is a tragic story, a moral downfall if you will, and Pacino plays it with such precision. His change from a likable, innocent everyman into a ruthless tyrant eerily similar to his old man is one of the most haunting and memorable performances in cinema. This film was also a launching point for the careers of many now famous actors, further highlighting &#8216;The Godfather&#8217;s excellent cast, including Robert Duvall, James Caan, and Diane Keaton. All deliver fantastic performances.Beyond the cast and writing (courtesy of Coppola and Mario Puzo, author of the book on which the film is based), the direction is a winner as well. Coppola really knows how to shoot scenes that emphasis tension and suspense. Most scenes have subtle storylines in and of themselves, and the consistent mood they establish as a whole serves to keep the themes of family allegiance and the moral consequences of serving in the mobster underworld alive and brutally close to the audience&#8217;s heart. Coppola does an admirable job of sustaining this tone from beginning to climax.Another thing he and Puzo do well is pace the violence with the character development. They are intricately and effectively intertwined so that brutal, captivating violence is all the more meaningful and the characters&#8217; evolution is more interesting, exciting, and engrossing. Instead of character development and arcs being at odds with the action, here in &#8216;The Godfather,&#8217; they act to work together and build on each other. Like they should.Like all the great films of cinema, &#8216;The Godfather&#8217; is far deeper than its premise or IMDb description suggests. That&#8217;s impressive, because almost everyone knows that the gangster classic is an incredibly deep, multi-layered film that can be appreciated on a wide variety of levels. The majority of viewers can simply be entertained by the tense hit-jobs and assassinations and the veteran acting, but they will largely miss a lot of what makes this movie so damn fantastic. Aside from its major strengths, the impeccable script and arc of Pacino&#8217;s Michael Corleone, &#8216;The Godfather&#8217; essentially shattered the then-popular concept and stereotype of the rough city gangster, becoming the trendsetter for most of the crime film sagas that would follow. It&#8217;s portrayal of complex, deep, and strikingly sympathetic gangsters, most notably by Brando, was shocking in many ways. While the leaders of organized crime are hardly glorified in the story by any means, the fact that these dark characters feel like real people with real emotions and vulnerabilities bordered on revolutionary for the time of its initial release. Films like Martin Scorsese&#8217;s &#8216;Goodfellas&#8217; and TV shows like HBO&#8217;s &#8216;The Soprano&#8217;s would probably never have existed if not for Coppola&#8217;s adaptation of Mario Puzo&#8217;s novel. Brian de Palma&#8217;s &#8216;Scarface&#8217; (also starring Pacino) is probably one of the few major gangster films that departed from the Corleone aesthetic, although that movie also showcased a very deep and emotionally complex crime lord.  Additionally, &#8216;The Godfather&#8217; is very much a patriarchal film that, in may respects, mirrors the complete opposite theme of a significantly feminist picture, like James Cameron&#8217;s &#8216;Aliens.&#8217; All of the major characters are male with one important exception, and the women in both the Corleone crime family and outside are kept entirely in the dark with regards to the goings-on of the &#8220;family business&#8221; and the politics of Mafia leadership. It is a very subtly sexist film, though I would argue that Coppola did this intentionally to make the more independent spark from Diane Keaton&#8217;s character more distinct.&#8216;The Godfather&#8217; is a perfect example of appropriate pacing of excitement with relaxation and character enrichment with setpieces and hallmark climaxes. All in all, this gangster classic is, well, much more than a gangster classic. It was and still is a trendsetter for American cinema and will forever be a benchmark for all the characteristics that make up a great film. It is arguably the most influential movie ever made, both at home and abroad. It is for these reasons that I consider &#8216;The Godfather&#8217; the greatest movie ever made. Or, as Ricky Bobby would put it, &#8220;Best movie ever made.&#8221; If there was an intergalactic film competition that showcased the best motion pictures from every planet in the universe, &#8216;The Godfather&#8217; is the film that I would choose to represent the cinema of humanity. It&#8217;s that good. So, sit down and spend some time with the Corleone family this weekend. It will be a weekend you won&#8217;t forget. If you only see one movie in your life, this one should be it. There are films, and then there are motion picture experiences. Experience &#8216;The Godfather.&#8217; Let the Don make you an offer you can&#8217;t refuse.&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-SCORE: 10/10+ In a cast full of legendary performances, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino stand out the most.+ Does a script get any better than this? A modern tragic masterpiece of a fantastic character&#8217;s fall from grace.+ There are at least ten different lines that have become all-time classics. The dialogue of Coppola&#8217;s epic will show you why gangster films are so commonly quoted.?

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3TFFSO47Z3BX8	"The Bluto ""adncjs3"""	&quot;The Godfather&quot; is the ultimate film experience.  Francis Ford Coppola gives us a rich story of honor, family, hard lessons and offers you can't refuse.  Beyond the intricate plotting which I think probably every mafia film requires, this film ultimately reveals itself as a stirring family drama.Al Pacino stars as Michael Corleone, a sort of prodigal son of the family business.  He returns from World War II as a hero on his sister's wedding day and finds his family nearly embroiled in a no holds barred Mafia War.  The &quot;family&quot; patriarc; Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando), is a man who believes in family and loyalty.  He is one mafia don you want on your side as the infamous beheaded horse scene tells us.The film finds it's stride once Michael assumes control of the family business, not for greed, money or power but for survival.  It is here where Coppola and screenwriter Mario Puzo present Michael in situations which tear at his soul.  Does he stand by his opinion of non-involvment of the family business as he states to his long suffering sweetheart Kaye (Diane Keaton) or does he embrace the ways of his father and save the Corleone family?I find &quot;The Godfather&quot; closely related to another epic film released just a few years after; &quot;Star Wars&quot;.  The story arc of the &quot;Star Wars Trilogy&quot; is very similar to what happens in just the first Godfather film.  Should Michael turn to the &quot;dark side&quot; and save his &quot;family/father&quot; from the inside?  I find it an interesting premise in both films knowing that Coppola and George Lucas have had a working experience before both films on &quot;American Graffti&quot;&quot;The Godfather&quot; is expertly written, gloriously casted, and the acting is legendary as is the film.  For a richly rewarding viewing experience I highly recomend &quot;The Godfather&quot;, it's certainly a hard offer to refuse.	5.0	The best family film ever made.	2000-10-06	3	2	1

We get all 3 classics (well, at least parts I & II are classics; part III is flawed but still worth a look), a commentary on each one, and a whole slew of features including deleted scenes, trailers galore, award acceptance speeches, and documentaries. Some people are complaining that part II is on two discs; that's because a 3-hour-movie plus a commentary cannot fit on one DVD. It's a minor inconvenience, but I'm willing to accept it to accomodate Coppola's commentary. Although I haven't seen the Godfather movies until a few weeks prior to the DVD release, I'm nonetheless very glad that I purchased this set. These films have influenced everything from later gangster epics (like ""Goodfellas"") to hip hop culture. And even though Marlon Brando was brilliant as the patriarch Vito, the heart of these movies belongs to Al Pacino, who should have received an Academy Award for his portrayal of Michael. However, the picture quality on all three of these films leaves a lot to be desired. Sharpness is a big concern, and many of the scenes that take place in dark rooms look rather grainy (""Part 3"" is especially bad). I also spotted a few scratches and spots throughout the film. All of the above aren't terribly distracting, but they show that Paramount didn't put a whole lot of love into the trasfers of these films. After all, these are the most-acclaimed films in Paramount's roster, so we naturally expect a near-flawless picture. Moreover, the sound isn't too bad, but it won't necessarily rock your system. Although, the helicopter attack in ""Part 3"" displayed good use of all five speakers; otherwise, it's a pretty bland soundtrack. Despite these gripes, it's hard to say ""no"" to these films. Although Paramount could have done a better job with the picture and sound, it's still a great package of what may be the greatest trilogy of all time."	5.0	Thank you, Paramount.	2001-10-13	5	4	1
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A33FA68V0NCM5E	TheIrrationalMan	The &quot;Godfather Trilogy&quot;, particulary parts I and II, are perhaps the definitive &quot;history&quot; of the Mafia captured on film. The films chart the lives of the Coreleone clan, Vito, the original godfather (Marlon Brando) and his son and successor, Michael, from a panoramic perspective, as Vito lands as an immigrant nine-year-old from Sicily in 1901, up to his rise as an influential mob boss, until the death of his son Michael in the 1980s. The first film is undeniably the best, containing a number of tense encounters, with Brando exuding tremendous charisma as Don Corleone, the man who makes you &quot;an offer you can't refuse&quot;. The second film is inferior, with a lot more bloodletting, though it may be confusing for those who haven't seen the first film, with its use of multiple flashbacks. Top honours have to go to Robert De Niro in the role of the young godfather, Vito Corleone, even though he doesn't appear with Al Pacino in not even a single scene. The third film, (originally planned as &quot;The Godfather III: The Death of Michael Corleone&quot;, is by far the weakest, though, but it does work up to a great finale, with a massacre being elaborately intercut with an opera performance. The three films' production values, (direction, cinematography and Nino Rota's magical score) are all of a top standard. A particularly unique way in which the films defy convention is its portrayal of the Mafia killers, extortionists, blackmailers and thugs as doting fathers and affectionate family men with a strong sense of justice and loyalty, though this is also accomplished at the cost of portraying their lives as violent, risky, cruel, unstable and inevitably tragic.	3.0	The history of the Mafia	2001-08-15	21	3	18
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A5TZXWU8AALIC	The JuRK	"I found it stunning that Francis Ford Coppola was disappointed with THE GODFATHER.  While other 70's super directors like William Friedkin won an Oscar for THE FRENCH CONNECTION, Coppola moaned during the editing of the first film, ""I've made a movie about a bunch of guys talking in dark rooms.""He just didn't know what he had.  (And, after listening to his commentaries, maybe he even now STILL doubts his accomplishments).The first and second GODFATHER films are genuine American masterpieces.  Everything works.  The DVD extras are great.  The casting, the writing, the cinematography, the music--it just all works.  You hear the word ""Shakespearean"" brought up a lot about the first two GODFATHER films, and I agree that they both reach those heights.The third film is like the Fredo of the trilogy: ""It's got a good heart, but it's weak and stupid.""  Does anyone honestly believe that Michael would suddenly start trying to win Kaye back?  (She's lucky she didn't end up at the bottom of Lake Tahoe herself!).I'd always heard that Paramount asked Coppola for a third GODFATHER, and he said give me six months to write the script.  Paramount said you've got six weeks.  GODFATHER III plays like a rough draft of something that might have worked.  But definitely doesn't.The movie comes alive for Andy Garcia's first scenes (as Sonny's illegitimate son), but then it just falls apart.But I do have to say: everyone complained about Sofia Coppola jumping into the role of Michael's daughter when Winona Ryder dropped out (I couldn't see her anyway), but I actually thought Sofia looked and acted the part perfectly.(I mean, if the studio had had their way with the first film, Charlton Heston would've been Vito and Ryan O'Neal would've been Michael!)."	5.0	True American Cinema Greatness	2005-02-16	7	6	1

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2SSKYPTPTFC4U	Thomas J. Novak	The restoration seems even darker; not in tone but in cinematography.  With the interiors you feel like you are inside a large black, velvety fedora.  Was the director trying to make a black and white movie, but knowing he was forced to use color?  Though the sequel (II) is probably the better movie, it misses the presence of Brando.  After one has watched The Godfather twenty times one starts asking what if, but never to analyze it to search for deeper meanings or underlining gems of subtlety that suddenly showcase in your mind some lofty idea in the story that caused the director to shoot the movie in a certain light.  Orson Welles wanted the role as the Godfather.  It would have worked, but  with likely completely different results.  He would have been swarthier, more sedentary, looking more like a capo than a businessman.  In any case The Godfather is one of those movies you can watch again and again.  It is thoroughly entertaining.  If they made it today, Jim Carrey would play Sonny, George Bush would play Fredo, Johnny Depp would be Clemenza, Leonardo DeCaprio would be Michael, Robert Duval would keep his role and of course the Godfather would be played by Angela Joli...or maybe not.	4.0	Godfathers Restoration	2010-12-28	2	1	1

It is so amazing that almost 30 years since I viewed the first Godfather when I was only 16 years old, that I am still amazed with this saga.  It only goes to show that good movie-making transends all generations and time.  Francis Ford Coppola is without a doubt, the most prolific movie-maker of our generation.  Many Scorsesse buffs may refute this, but, none of Scorsesse's flicks can hold a candle to the Godfather Collection. The movies must be watched in the order in which they were made...never mind the sold-called Saga which re-edited them.  Each one of the individual movies themselves is a story within itself...and, produced as such.Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duval, all are the most important actors of our time.  I do not see any inkling of the brilliance of these performers in any so-called movie-stars of our time...and, I have tried and tried to find some sort of greatness in today's actors which comes close...I haven't seen it yet!.	5.0	The Greatest Actors in the Greatest Movies Ever Made!	2001-05-15	0	0	0

Pacino portrays this character and his trials and education in an incredibly convincing manner.This is the movie which defined cinema in the latter half of the 20th century and established Pacino, Brando, Caan, and Duvall as respected actors. Experience this for yourself.One of my favourite quotes:Don Corleon: I'm a superstitious man, and if some unlucky accident should befall Michael - if he is to be shot in the head by a police officer, or be found hung dead in a jail cell... or if he should be struck by a bolt of lightning - then I'm going to blame some of the people in this room; and then I do not forgive.Don't just rent this: buy this movie.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AV5G37VFE5NVD	Tom Benton	The GODFATHER trilogy needs no introduction.  THE GODFATHER, released in 1972 and based on Mario Puzo's novel (at one time the bestselling novel of all time), is considered by many to be the greatest film of all time.  It was directed and co-written by young Francis Ford Coppola, who did an absolutely outstanding job.  Gordon Willis' unflinching and beautiful cinematography is superb, while Nino Rota's sweeping score is unforgettable.  The cast is magnificent.  Marlon Brando, in his signature role as wheezy-voiced Don Vito Corleone, is marvelous, as is Al Pacino as his youngest son, Michael Corleone.  Michael has vowed never to get involved in the family business, but the attempted murder of his father forces him to take action.  James Caan is also excellent as the hot-tempered Sonny Corleone.One of the most debated questions amongst movie buffs is which is better - THE GODFATHER part I or THE GODFATHER: PART II?  Though many will say that THE GODFATHER is superior, just as many will argue that THE GODFATHER: PART II is the best.  Either way, it's an equally impressive film that's even more epic than its predecessor.  About 3/5 of the film follows Michael Corleone's rule as Don in 1958; the other 2/5 follow young Vito Corleone's (Robert De Niro) arrival in New York City in the early-1900s and his uprising as a mob boss.  De Niro is excellent; he won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role.  Pacino's performance is extraodinary, the highlight of his career.  The cinematography, script and directing are as flawless as ever, and Nino Rota's score is even more grandiose than before.THE GODFATHER: PART III is one of the most controversial films ever made.  As a normal film, it's very good; however, as a GODFATHER film, it's quite weak.  The film begins in 1979, where aging Michael Corleone has finally ceased his involvement with the mob and is enjoying a reputation as a philanthropist.  Victor Mancini (Andy Garcia), the illegitimate son of Michael's deceased brother Sonny, comes to Michael seeking a job, and soon after a mob war ensues, pulling Michael back in to the world of the mafia.  The film lacks the power and feeling of the first two films; it just doesn't feel like a GODFATHER movie.  It was made for money because Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Studios was going bankrupt; it was not made because it needed to be made.  Another of the film's biggest flaws is Sofia Coppola as Michael's daughter; as a director, she is quite talented, but as an actress, she is not so talented, and is woefully miscast.  I would recommend seeing the film if only to quell your curiosity, and because it has a truly fantastic ending.THE GODFATHER and THE GODFATHER: PART III are 1-disc sets; THE GODFATHER: PART II is a 2-disc set.  Each film has been remastered in beautiful anamorphic widescreen and with excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound.  They are packaged in gorgeous, dark thin packaging, and each features full-length commentary with director Coppola.  Exclusive to this set is a disc of bonus material running over three hours, including deleted scenes (and the footage from the TV versions), alternate scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and a Corleone family tree.  The bonus disc will knock the socks off GODFATHER fans.If you haven't seen these films - you have no clue what you're missing.  I would recommend that you drop what you're doing and go out and purchase this set right now.  The first two films are probably the best ever made, and the third is good as well.  For the reasonably low price this set sells at, it's an offer you can't refuse.	5.0	An offer you can't refuse	2006-08-10	6	5	1

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A31EZZ14E0IIME	Tom Harrison	The Godfather Trilogy is perhaps the greatest film achievement in history. Unlike so many past classics, it does not age, and is still relevant to tadoy's youth.Part 1 is my favourite of the collection, and is only made what it is by Marlon Brando. He is everything you expect of a Mafioso, charming and powerful, yet cold and deadly. As Don Vito Corleone, Brando makes the role his own and lifts this movie to unimaginable heights.Al Pacino as Michael the All-American war hero turned killer is also wonderful, and The Godfather is just a taste of what is to come.Part 2 portrays Michael and a younger Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) at the same age, both trying to cement positions in the underworld. De Niro's performance in this movie is captivating, and it is the first time I have been so intensely drawn in by a character whose dialogue is in a foreign language. It is a true skill to be able to draw an audience in when they are reading your words at the same time, and I now have the utmost respect for Robert De Niro.Part 2 has a much deeper emotional feeling, as Michael Corleone struggles to live up to his father's impeccable reputation. Very different to Part1, but just as high quality.I have read mixed reviews for Part 3, many saying it was a cheap attempt at cashing in, but after watching the movie to see the Godfather's conclusion I have to disagree.In Part 3, Michael has grown old, and is determined to clear the Corleone name before he dies. Battling diabetes, he looks to his son to be his successor, but after his offer is turned down, he looks to Vincent Mancini to take the ranes.Vincent, played by Andy Garcia, is a short-tempered Italian trying to make it as a gangster, but Michael tries to teach him how things work when you're in &quot;the family&quot;. Garcia is perfectly cast, and shows both sides of Vincent wonderfully.A fitting conclusion to the masterful trilogy, Part 3 is every bit as good as the first two films.The Godfather Collection is a film-lover's dream, and is a necessary part of any video library.	5.0	Ageless classic...	2003-08-21	0	0	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2HB1IGHAGZNPA	Tom Mestancik	This trilogy is an even bigger masterpiece than Star Wars.  It explains to you in full detail the struggle of how to keep a mob and a family together and happy.  Brando plays an excellent role as the first godfather and I  think he did his definite best at it.  Pacino was terrific in this movie as  well.  The only thing I find wrong is that Pacino plays the godfather in  all three videos and I think that was okay but you know it wasn't really  meant to be since micheal (Pacino) started out in the army and had no clue  how to even run a mob.  I give this movie 5 stars because it is a definite  masterpiece and anyone who says that it isn't well written should be shot  because I don't think you could get a better story about the moffia	5.0	I think that this trilogy is a masterpiece.	1999-12-12	8	4	4

They are grainy, have blips, and the lighting is overly dark. Others reviewers here have said the same, so this is not just my overimagination. I love the films as much as anyone, but cannot DE-recommend this collection enough.Coppola obviously put absolutely NO effort into cleaning up the old prints. Seeing that he has not done anything really worthy since 1979 (Apocolypse Now), I take this release as a way for Coppola and Paramount to maximize their return at the expense of quality, and our pocketbooks.Please, don't make the mistake I did.

Great touching and heartbreaking story of a man who would ""burn in hell"" to protect his family.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AUXSNR1UOILRD	UnbreakableMJ	"(This review is for The Godfather DVD Collection (2001) [ASIN: B00003CXAA])1. THE FILMSIt would be unfair of me to write such short review for all the 3 films but I have to due to make this review as useful as possible.The films are legendary, very popular & highly-regarded by both critics & people. Great films with great acting (by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton & Talia Shire among many others), great score/soundtrack (by Nino Rota & Carmine Coppola) with many popular songs, great script based on a great novel (by late Mario Puzo), great cinematography (by Gordon Willis), great atmospheres... et al.Some of my favorite bits about these films includes: the outstanding performances by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino & Robert De Niro, the scene with Woltz in bed (Part I) & the long scene with Fanucci walking the street (Part II). Another thing I like about The Godfather Trilogy is how it was less about crime and more about family. It's also exciting to see how Coppola did focus on family in real life (just like the film itself) by using them in these films.The least favorite to most people would be Part III as it wasn't good enough. It actually was a good conclusion to the trilogy but was underrated because it didn't hold up to high expectations from the fans as well as to the great reputation of Part I & Part II. Al Pacino gave us another great performance. My guess is that it would've got a better reputation if the studio accepted Coppola's suggested title ""Death of Michael Corleone"".Speaking of conclusions, a good conclusion to this review would be to praise Francis Ford Coppola's outstanding work from his great writing to superb directing to making such a great high-value DVD box set. Thank you Francis Ford Coppola.Note: For a great review, check Emipre Magazine's article in issue 180 (June 2004) pages 166~167 (the article's called Masterpieces (#12)).Godfather, The (1972) 5/5Godfather: Part II, The (1974) 5/5Godfather: Part III, The (1990) 5/5__________________________________________________2. THE DVDSHere's an offer you can't refuse: buy this 5-disc Box Set because there never was an offer this good with a reasonable price.Each film has its own DVD book-like keep-case with covers that shows respect to both the fans (especially the elder ones) and to the films too. Each film has an Aspect Ratio of 1.85:1, Closed-captioned, English & French audio tracks both Dolby Digital 5.1 (no DTS) & subtitles. Each film comes with a great informative audio commentary by (Francis Ford) Coppola. Part I comes in a single disc, so does Part III, and Part II comes in 2 discs. This is a good thing yet bad thing. It's good because they cared to give us the highest quality yet it's bad because you'll have to stop and change the disc exactly after the long scene with Fanucci walking the street (a similar problem was with the 1st DVD edition of Godfellas (1990) were we had to flip it). So we have a total of 4 discs for the whole 3 films plus a disc of extras. Godfather Part I (alone) is already out on DVD (which comes in a keep-case) and I guess Part II & Part III are coming shortly but those who buy each part apart would miss the extra stuff (listed below).The 5th disc (the disc of extras/bonus stuff) comes with:- A great documentary (73 min.) which is full of trivia and behind-the-scenes stories and footage.- All the deleted-scenes.- A look into Francis Coppola's Notebook which was his own guide to making the films.- Cool rehearsal footage.- Clips with Gordon Willis, Nino Rota, Carmine Coppola, Francis Ford Coppola, Mario Puzo & a short clip about locations.- Academy Award acceptance speeches & list of awards.- Corleone family tree.And few more features (see DVD Features in the Product Details above or Technical Information also above).The Godfather DVD Collection (2001) 5/5__________________________________________________3.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2IU2BSVWQLKJ7	Unlucky Frank	"This Review is based on The Standard DVD format Restoration, not The Blu-ray Version.I'm on the fence about this New Restoration Box Set(The Restored GODFATHER III is a cleaner version), but I'm leaning towards an all-out PAN of this New Restoration. Unfortunately, I listened to some of the reviewers here and purchased this Set. (A couple of you owe me a few bucks.) It doesn't look like any of the reviewers here did a side-by-side comparison test of The New Restoration and The Original Versions of these films on DVD. I did mine on a 50"" Panasonic plasma.Yes, the New prints have fewer scratches, dirt, and grain than The Original Set, (which is not as bad as some reviewers suggest). But, the COLOR ENHANCEMENT of The New Restoration Set is OVERLY saturated in many parts. Especially, in the Red Scale. Yellows and orange flesh tones are extremely pronounced, overly brilliant, and unnatural looking in this Set. And it still contains scratches, dirt, and grain. Not as much as The Original Set, but it's still there. A lot of the grain in certain frames has been removed, while other frames remain untouched and appear to be just as grainy as The Original Version. A very uneven transfer in my opinion.In the opening shot of THE GODFATHER, the Undertaker is so overly saturated with yellow that as the camera pulls back to reveal Don Corleone's desk, it renders The Undertaker almost out of focus. Trust me, this shot looks far better in The Original Set. Compare the shot in THE GODFATHER of Luca Brasi in his apartment, donning his bulletproof vest, in preparation for his meeting with Sollozzo. The colors in The Original Version look natural, while The Restoration renders Luca's apartment in a blazing wash of bright sunshine yellow. These frames are entirely over-saturated with color. I assure you, certain frames of this Restoration DO NOT look anything like the Original film stock print. The warm and natural looking sepia tone of The Original film has been blasted away with digital color in many frames, almost making them look unreal.THE GODFATHER II has been compressed onto one disc, while The Original Version was compressed onto 2 discs.(By the way, I could care less about The TV Saga Version. It's not the way these films were shot, and it's not the way they were intended to be seen.)Some frames of The New Restoration look very grainy, some look  incredible, while other frames make these films appear as if Ted Turner Colorized them. At times, I wasn't sure if I was watching THE GODFATHER, or SPEED RACER.Is this version worth a Double Dip? I'm still on the fence about that. But, I think I prefer The Original Box Set over this half-baked attempt at improving this Classic with an over-saturation of color.I get the feeling that The Blu-ray Version must look really odd. Blu-ray is great technology for newer films. Older films tend to suffer from over-saturation with this technology. The public is so enamoured with Blu-ray, they don't realize some of the classic older films don't resemble their original celluloid color exposures anymore. And that's a shame. It's going to take some more time before remastering technicians understand the remastering treatment that some of these classic older films deserve. Sometimes less is more.If you must have The Restoration, turn the brightness and color way down on your TV.I'm calling this THE GODFATHER: THE COPPOLA VIDEO GAME GIFTSET.Act accordingly.UPDATE:There is no question that this Standard DVD Remastered Version is overly saturated with color. Here is a pretty SIMPLE ADJUSTMENT SOLUTION that seems to work quite well, reproduces truer color, and makes these Remastered films much more enjoyable. At least it did on my 50"" Panasonic Viera plasma. (I also use this for The Anniversary Remaster of SCARFACE which is also overly saturated with color.) Stay away from the VIVID and CINEMA Picture Settings. Use the STANDARD Picture Setting which will give you the following numbers: Picture 50, Brightness 50, Color 50, Tint 0, and Sharpness 75. Simply tune the COLOR setting down from 50 to 35. I found that changes to the other settings were not necessary. This should take care of the overly saturated playback color issue. I do not know whether this adjustment will work as well with an LCD, Projection, Tube TV, or Blu-Ray Disc."	3.0	THE GODFATHER, The Coppola Video Game Giftset	2008-09-26	148	126	22

It's a great collection at a very good price.  Just a little note, not all Italians are members of the mafia, as a matter of fact, very few are.  I'm Italian and before I got married to my husband, my mother-in-law asked me if I had a Godfather.  Having been raised a Catholic, I said yes.  Her next question was, does he always carry a gun?  I looked at my soon to be husband because I was confused, and he said she had just seen the Godfather movie and was refering to a mafia Godfather.  I assured her that my Godfather happened to be my baptisimal Godfather in the Catholic Church.  Thought you might like this true story.  I still laugh when I remember the look on my mother-in-laws face when I told her I had a Godfather.	5.0	The Godfather Collection	2012-05-13	2	0	2

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1TED36K2SNRXP	Violinp32	"I was 12 when I walked into the den and saw a lavish wedding on TV. I asked my mom what movie was playing, and she said, ""The Godfather."" I asked if I could watch. She warned me that it was violent and had sex in it, but I still wanted to watch it. That was the first time I watched an R - rated film, and the first time I was introduced to the wonder that is the The Godfather Saga.I got this DVD set for Christmas, and I have no complaints about the quality of the picture. Yes, it's very a very dark picture at times, but that only adds to the mood and beauty of the films. The commentary by Francis Ford Coppola is entertaining and informative, and even the deleted scenes are great. I haven't watched the documentaries yet, but I'm sure I'll enjoy those as well.Of course, there are naysayers who think that since it's not surround - sound and isn't crystal clear like today's movies that it's an inferior product. I disagree; this is a great print of the earlier films, and you don't need it to be up to the standards of, say, AVATAR, to be beautiful cinematography. Moreover, I don't need to be assaulted on all sides by gun blasts to appreciate the fact that a character is getting shot.In closing, I would like to say that my love of The Godfather Saga has only increased with watching this product, and I still feel the thrill I felt when I was a 12 year old young woman watching these movies for the first time."	5.0	The Godfather Still Thrills!	2012-03-01	1	1	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A3CUB8VJKLLWDP	Vito Andolini	The Godfather is by far the greatest film ever made.  The drama and excitement of a mafia, but most importantly, of a family of Italian Americans who occasionally commit murder one.  The Godfather II continues the saga, and the torch has been passed, and Michael takes complete control.  The Godfather III is a touching conclusion, in which Pacino works for redemption for his family.  The Greatest.  This review is kept thin so that it will be read, and many important event were left out, and this doesn't even do it justice.  I am a godfather buff, and have awaited its release on DVD for quite some time now.

What ya gonna' do?  We had nothing to do with it, It was between the directors.Forgive my mixing of mob movie metaphors.Their has been a lot of talk about the results of this restoration.  I think it can be split into two categories.  Image quality, and Image color.  The extras disc claims the movie was a victim of its own success, in that many more film prints for theaters were made from the original master than were expected.  This caused deterioration in the original master, and forty years later some of the frames in the original master are just gone and beyond repair. Can any of us say we haven't experienced some physical deterioration since 1970?  So they had to fill in the holes as best they could. This process is explained in detail on the extras disc.  In a nutshell, you can't fill in something with nothing, and the filler had to be consistent with the entire film or visa versa.  This is why it has been digitized, normalized, and has a bit of a video game look.  Given current technology, this is about as good as anyone could do.Now about the Coloring, and blown out whites. This was a personal choice of the editors and director of photography who worked as a team during the restoration process.  According to the extras disc, Coppola signed off on the final copy but wasn't directly involved in the day to day restoration process.  The team claimed this is as close as possible as to what was seen at the theater when the film opened. The key words here are AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE.So, in a nutshell, the Coppola restoration is that in name only, but still is as good as any team could do given what they had to work with.  Pixel peepers won't be happy with it, but seldom are anyway, and since Mr. Peabody and his Wayback Machine hasn't been able to retrieve the unharmed original master from 1970, this is about as good as it gets.  If your looking for the resolution, and sharpness of Avitar, then you will be disappointed because it was never there in the first place.  It's a great film, so sit back and relax and Forget about it.	4.0	The Original Master sleeps with the fishes, It is what it is.	2009-12-26	1	1	0

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	Coppola's trilogy has withstood the test of time well. The first film has a number of strong moments but, ultimately, both Michael and Kaye's characters are underwritten. Overall, the tone and writing are amazingly consistent from film to film. The picture and sound quality is truly outstanding. Coppola's comments are very interesting and add depth to the film.The second film tends to be the strongest of the series. All the characters are more fully realized and have clearer motivation. The picture quality for the second film is stunning given the age of the negative. Both the sound and picture have been cleaned up for DVD release.The third film is a bit more problematic. Coppola's operatic finale to the Godfather saga sags a bit because of all the plot threads he tries to resolve. Nevertheless, Coppola and his collaborator Puzo manage to pull it all together.Andy Garcia is well cast although under used in his role. Sophia Coppola doesn't have the strong acting skills of Winona Ryder (originally castin the film) but she still manages to pull off her role with grace. Yes, she's miscast and yes, she's out of her element given the actors she's working with but given that this is her debut she does a credible job.The strongest parts of the third film are the various set pieces. The attempted assination at the opera is brilliantly realized. Pacino gives an admirable performance as Michael. The film really could have used Robert Duvall in his role as Tom the family attorney (he was holding out for more money and took Days of Thunder instead). George Hamilton gives a credible performance but, again, lacks the screen presence of Duvall. I don't doubt there would have been more cinematic sparks flying if Pacino and Duvall had appeared on screen together again. It's clear that when Duvall turned down the role, the part was reduced and rewritten for Hamilton.The three films together work much better than the three alone. Even if Coppola didn't intend this to be a trilogy when he started out, all three films benefit from the ability to watch the characters grow.	4.0	4 Stars for the first, 5 for the second and 3 for the third	2001-12-26	1	1	0

Not that this is an original observation either.  What I'm truly disappointed in was FFC's commentary for his 3rd installment.  Not once did he apologize.  No apology obviously for putting his daughter in this movie.  No apology for the terrible editing that was pervasive upon the release of the movie to theaters when it was rushed out for the oscar season.  No apology for Al Pacino's over acting when it was his under stated performances in the first two that made his incredible rage outbursts so terrifying in Godfather II towards his wife.  No apology for the big money grab this was.  No apology for none of it.I get it.  The man had to keep paying off the creditors from his prior box office bombs.  He gets a pass for most of his other works he slummed around with during the 80s.  So what if Paramount was making this with or without him.  It was gonna be a stinker and he woulda been better off standing free and clear of this disaster flick then helm it.  There had to be a point super early on when he knew, just knew this was such lesser material.  I know that movie executives are soulless money grabbers.  I get it that the typical movie producer has no integrity.  But when FFC himself does this to his own work than my faith in the artist is just shaken.I just want to know one thing from him.  Why did he even bother.  I've sat through plenty of lesser works from other great directors.  Not everything is the grand magnum opus.  Not every work has to surpass previous achievements.  But somethings must be held sacred to the creator.  That 3rd Godfather was as pointless as Indy Jones IV.  Just cause we the public might think we need another sequel doesn't mean we should get what we want.  The artist is to save us from ourselves, not pander to our baser desires.	5.0	Of course, the first two are obviously master piece movie making.

And Marlon Brando made it Great!! I just love the movie and how they respected him and the ones that stepped in his shoes after death. They were a very close knitted family and thats the way family really should be.  Especially if you still live with them. Or if you respect and honor them.  I would very much like to see Godfather IV. It was on T.V. with Pacino very gray and his son was given the ring. But Pacino sister didn't like him. And I can't remember if the son took it or not. If possible fine this movie, please. If you like the way life was then or still is then you will really love these movies. I believe you can get a child to understand these movies.

In the early '80 NBC ran the GF1 and GF2 in cronological order with all of the out takes. The movie started with young Vito in Sicily and ended with Micheal making a deal with the Sicilian mob over the heroin business started by Solozzo and Barzini. This was what I was expecxting with this DVD, all of the out takes incorporated into the movie.I felt that this offering was simply Francis Ford Copolla rasing money to keep his wine vinyard. He took the three movies, put them in DVD format, dug up some old interviews, a family tree with descriptions of some of the members, slapped it together in a package with a large price tag. Some of the desciptions had major mistakes. Like they say Michael Killed Solozzo and the police captian in a &quot;Brooklyn&quot; resturant. Sorry that should have been a Bronx resturant.I wish they would have released the NBC movie instead. I think the name of that movie was &quot;Mario Puzzo's the Godfather a novel for TV&quot;, and for us dye hard fans of these great movies that would have fit the bill. What they released made me feel as though I was taken advantage of. Just when I thought I had enough they pull me back in&quot;.	3.0	&quot;It wasn't what I wanted&quot;	2001-10-21	4	2	2

I purchased the collection on DVD way before the Coppola restoration came out and I just loved them. I have seen each movie at least 6-7 times a year since I bought them.With them coming out on blu-ray, I was really having high expectations that the movies would look great in 1080p. Boy was I wrong (with the exception of the godfather 3 but I'll get into that later)The first and second movie looked exactly as the DVD version did, though maybe not as grainy in some parts but for the most part, it looked identical, the sound and color had been enhanced a bit but nothing that said ""WOW"" to me. I can totally understand why, the technology wasn't present when they filmed them over 30 years ago, but come on, this was billed as ""like you've never seen"" and it wasn't.The third movie was great in my opinion, others my disagree but I thought that it was filled with as much deceit, intrigue, and murder as the others before it. Maybe this one was too much centered on action and the needless inclusion of Sophia Coppola (Why Francis why?)  as Michael's Daughter. but anyways, back to the review. The picture looks totally better than the dvd version. I could actually see fine detail that I didn't think I could.So should you buy this Blu-ray box set?yes-only if you don't have the dvd version.no- if you have the dvds, don't bother, except for the third movie.And as always, never fear your enemy."	4.0	Great movies, but the conversions are not really worthy	2012-06-20	4	3	1

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1COQ2DOO1O9HD	Wing J. Flanagan	There are many reasons to buy this collection.  It should go without saying that anyone serious about film should make the investment.  Buy it; set aside some quality time, and then watch the films through in sequence - twice.  The first time, just enjoy them.  The second time, listen to the commentary tracks by director Francis Ford Coppola.  Yes, even Godfather III.*Especially* Godfather III.  Why?  Allow me a brief word about each film:The Godfather: Arguably the Great American Film of the seventies.  If there were a competition for the honor, it would be against two other films by Coppola - The Conversation and Apocalypse Now (among others - perhaps Chinatown and Taxi Driver, too).  To listen to Coppola's commentary is a revelation.  He does not tell many stories that film buffs don't already know, but his tone of voice speaks volumes on its own.  He allows his emotions to come through, and we can tell when he is proud of a scene (like the Salazzo murder in the restaurant), frustrated, or disappointed (he points out some problems in some of the &quot;cheap second-unit footage&quot; that I had never noticed). As has been revealed elsewhere, Coppola worked in constant fear of being fired.  The studio was breathing down his neck, second-guessing him, and did not give him the money and moral support he needed.  It almost seems as though they WANTED him to fail.  The outcome of this brutalizing experience is history.  But this is just a prelude to...The Godfather, Part 2: Lightening struck twice. It is perhaps the only truly great sequel in film history (though fans of Lucas' Star Wars saga might disagree). By now, Coppola's clout allowed him a kind of control and freedom he did not enjoy on the first film.  His commentary picks up in pace and tone.  Despite reservations (he was not initially certain that a sequel could really work or was appropriate), he had a good time and was able to do some remarkable work.  Its recreation of turn-of-the-century New York (in the pre-CGI age) is astonishing.  See the documentary material on disc 5 for great behind-the-scenes material on how they did it.  The Godfather, Part 2 broke a lot of new ground, and belied the notion that suffering is a requirement in producing great art.  But the most poignant revelations are in...The Godfather, Part 3:  Like many others, I used to think of this film as something of an orphan - not really in league with the prior installments of the series; more a typical Hollywood attempt to squeeze the old cash-cow.  In some ways, this is exactly what it was.  But I promise you, listening to Coppola narrate his experiences in the making of this film will give you a whole new appreciation of it.  His reflections are sometimes quite moving.  He is an artist fully aware of the achievements of the first two films, and at once exhilarated and anguished by the almost certainly futile quest to recapture the old magic.  Especially moving is his frank discussion of the controversy over his casting daughter Sofia as Mary Corleone, Michael's ill-fated daughter in the film.  There is no denying he is a loving father, and that critical attacks on her performance wounded him deeply.  While (as he acknowledges) she lacked the polish of her more experienced co-stars, there are, in fact, moments of emotional truth in her performance. Knowing these dynamics makes the ending of the film all the more resonant.  For him, it must be almost unbearable.Disc 5 of the collection contains a generous selection of documentary material - a must for aspiring filmmakers.  Of special importance to me is a short piece on Coppola's notebook created by him in the making of the first film.  If you would aspire to create great cinema, watch this one closely, and take notes.Of course, the performances by people like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, James Caan, the late John Cazale, and Robert Duvall are amazing.  So is Gordon Willis' eloquently dark cinematography, Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola's music, etc.  One could go on and on, literally. But for me, this DVD collection has provided a new perspective on the director of these three films:At one point in his commentaries, Coppola points out that the correct way to address a Don (not used in the films) is by title followed by first name - i.e., Don Vito rather than Don Corleone...or in Coppola's case, Don Francis or Don Francesco, rather than Don Coppola.For this reason, I think of the Godfather DVD Collection as The Collected Wisdom of Don Francesco.

First just to have all 3 movies together in a blu ray set, but this collection shines with extras.  I devoted a whole night to watching the extras! And if you don't need another set of these movies, then buy this for a family member or friend - maybe someone who has never experienced them.

True mob/drama lovers will rate this film highly.  There is no other film project like it.Even those not into the mob scene should watch this collection.  The lives of the characters as they unfold are rich and complex.  The character development from beginning to end is realistic and engaging.

6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	AY8WZDYR79GFV	Yasha Banana	"I don't like these Godfather movies, by gosh, bygolly.  Too much violence, not enough sex.For example, we're told that Fredo Corlieone was ""banging cocktail waitresses two at a time,"" but correct me if I'm wrong, we never actually see him banging any of these waitresses.Sure, during the wedding scene Fredo's brother, Sonny Corlieone, has wall-sex with one of the wedding guests.  But James Caan isn't even Italian!  So what's the dang-deal, man?And poor Michael Corlieone.  He gets to be Godfather.  The King.  The Big Enchilada.  And who does he get to bang? ... Diane Keaton. ... He might as well work for the post office, man!Then there's Don Corlieone (no relationship to ""Soul Train's"" Don Cor-nel-ius!).  The Don gets to bang Morgana King; but lemme tell ya, that's like drivin' over ten miles of bad road in a Yugo.Troy Donahue got to bang Connie Corlieone, but since Talia Shire is far-sighted, rumor has it, she thought it was *Phil* Donahue -- which right there would make anyone's stomach turn.Of course, other than Sonny's brief stand-up routine, we never got to see any decent banging; let alone two or three at a time.  The closest we came to checking out Fredo's action is when he asked Kay Corlieone to stand on a mirror while he drooled pathetically all over his nice Ivy League suit.  AND YOU CALL THAT FILMMAKING!  I've seen better banging at a high school drum & bugle contest.Now take Tony Soprano.  Now there's a mafia don who sure'nuf can ""bang 'em two at a time.""  Three if necessary.He banged more service-oriented members of the lumpen proleteriat in one teevee episode than the entire Corlieone patriarchy did in three goll-darn movies.And Tom, Tom Hagen.  Why, you miserable sexless wretch.  Where's the beef, counselor?  Where's the strudel?  Where's the Ba-Da-Bing girls you're supposed to being bailing out on a regular basis? ... Sir, you disgust me!In short, whatever happened to ""sex and violence""?  Don't they go together like a horse and carriage?  Like Frick and Frack.  Like Laurel and Hardy and Missus Laurel and Missus Hardy.Like Dolly Parton.Can you believe it -- a movie about Italians, and the only guy who gets laid is a James Caan, a bar mitzvah boy.Oye, the humanity!"	1.0	Is That Sonny Corlieone Banging on the Door?	2009-09-26	160	16	144
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2552UW23ZDDJI	Yifeng Zhang	I preordered this DVD long before it is released. I like it so much. The first episode is classic and the 2nd episode is evenbetter. Robert De niro is quite charismatic as the growing mafiaboss and the different scences intervened together quite well.The third one is not as good as the first two. However, it is still pretty awesome to watch. The extra disk is not worth that much.

The white spots are even more shocking esepcially when the films have  a dark composition.  Even if the spots are branded on the masters, they could have masked or removed these spots digitally, since they did a frame by frame restoration.There is no point of the blu ray technology with its depth and resolution when we cannot get ""pure"" images as promised, and when white spots that could be easily fixed or removed ruin the images.The studios should have a budget to fix this problem.  They could spend hundreds of millions on a film, but fail to spend a bit on fixing the white spots on the blu ray releases.  Blu ray should have a clean and perfect picture AT LEAST, and should surpass the theatrical experience with dirty and scratched prints (and those black spots when reels are changed), especially when Blu ray discs are not cheap."	3.0	Picture quality	2008-10-30	13	8	5
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A1FM5VJMPK0MDG	"Yolanda Anne Brown ""Yogi"""	Incredible saga from start to finish. From the rise of Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro as young Vito, Marlon Brando as old Vito), to the rise and devastating fall of Michael (Hauntingly played by Al Pacino),The Godfather Trilogy is incredible (Even the last one, with the badly miscast Sofia Coppola). The Corleones are the ultimate anti-heroes: you want to root for them to bump off their enemies, and yet, they are also the bad guys. You even root for Sonny (Wickedly played by James Caan), when he beats up his abusive brother-in-law. They also suffer from betrayal from within the family: Fredo (Wonderfully acted by the late John Cazale), betrays his brother Michael just so he could have a little something for himself. Michael's reaction to Fredo's betrayal is heartbreaking. It's too bad that this is not delved more deeply in the final chapter instead of putting in plots that go nowhere (The fling between Bridget Fonda and Andy Garcia simply goes nowhere at all). All in all, the trilogy deals with loss: From the loss of Vito's family, to the loss of Michael's soul when he takes over the family business. This film is a must have in your collection.	5.0	The Saga From Start To Finish	2004-03-02	11	9	2
6302610702	The Godfather Collection [VHS]	A2SN248D9X88IL	Zachary Cheeley	"what people are calling ""noise"" is simply the anolog nature of the source film. its like criticizing vinyl for ""hissing"". that IS the film. if you saw it in the theater in '71 you saw that ""noise"" on the screen.yes, something shot digitally is going to look cleaner, but let's be clear here: its not supposed to look clean.from editorsguild.com/v2/magazine/archives/exclusive/exclusive_082808.htmRE-MADE MAN`The Godfather' Restorationby Bill DesowitzThe Holy Grail for digital restoration is definitely 4K. The Godfather and its indispensable sequel, The Godfather Part II, couldn't have been saved without it. Thanks to an assist from Steven Spielberg, who convinced Paramount Pictures to finance their full-digital restorations along with the re-mastering of The Godfather: Part III, the landmark Mafia saga arguably looks better than ever.The result is The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration, available on Blu-ray and DVD from Paramount Home Entertainment September 23, following a limited theatrical run in selected cities (the Castro Theatre in San Francisco, September 5-11; Film Forum in New York, September 12-October 2; the ArcLight Dome in Hollywood, September 19-25; and the Music Box Theatre in Chicago, October 3-16).""What took so long was waiting for technology to catch up with need,"" asserts Robert Harris (Rear Window, Vertigo, Spartacus, Lawrence of Arabia), the specialist tapped by director Francis Ford Coppola to supervise the six-figure restoration project under the guidance of Paramount post-production chief and Spielberg alumn Martin Cohen. They worked for more than a year with Warner Bros. Motion Picture Imaging (MPI), while Pro-Tek Preservation Services inspected and stored all of the surviving film elements.However, the damage was worse than Harris realized as a result of decades of overuse and abuse. ""What was left of the original camera negative [OCN] had been severely overprinted,"" Harris explains. ""When we received the element, I believe that there were only five or six shots in the first 20 minutes that were still original. Virtually every splice was held together with mylar tape. Tears went into image in hundreds of frames. Sections were totally without perforations. The Godfather was shot on Eastman negative 5254, which has wonderful fade characteristics, and although it had faded, it was still very, very correctible for color. Part II was probably 75 percent better, as many more prints were made and there wasn't the need to continually go back to the OCN.""The MPI team, led by technical director/senior colorist Jan Yarbrough and Daphne Dentz, vice president of Digital Services, first scanned the negative and other replacement cuts, imported the terabytes of data into the computer system and then repaired, cleaned and color-corrected every frame. In addition, MPI also made a complete set of 4K preservation negatives, separation masters, and back-up data tapes for the trilogy.""Because of the way The Godfather was shot--because of the exposures, because of the black levels, because of the grain structure--it really couldn't be done without working entirely in 4K [the equivalent of film resolution],"" Harris suggests. ""We harvested an image from the negative and everything and anything under the sun, and put the picture together shot by shot.""""Around 60 percent of The Godfather negative was destroyed or unusable, so we had to replace it with images from six different kinds of elements, including CRIs and separations from CRIs,"" adds Yarbrough. ""The biggest challenge was finding the replacements for the damaged areas, going through all the replacements that we could dig up, evaluating them for what the best fit was going to be, and getting that element to blend in color-wise with the existing camera negative it would literally be cut into.""Although Coppola was not directly involved, he was always available for suggestions. One adjustment was to the famous opening shot: ""We wanted the blacks to be truly black, and the first image of Bonasera [Salvatore Corsitto] was to appear out of that,"" Coppola recalls.Thus, the bulk of the aesthetic heavy lifting rested with Gordon Willis, the trilogy's iconoclastic cinematographer. Known as the ""Prince of Darkness,"" Willis typically underexposed light to heighten the mood of a scene and maintained strict control so his films couldn't be brightened.""The Godfathers were designed to have a kind of classic retrospective look,"" Willis explains. ""The lighting structure came out of a need to present Marlon Brando properly as an aging, monolithic Don. My choice was to use overhead lighting to enhance Marlon's make-up; the only thing I wanted to hide on occasion was his eyes. All the lighting came out of Marlon's need, but it worked extremely well for everything else.""Unfortunately, Willis was unable to travel to LA from Massachusetts, so he led them through the basic design telephonically, with one imperative: Do not dial out the grain structure. Cinematographer and Spielberg alum Allen Daviau (E.T.) was therefore recruited as a liaison. ""Allen can see a quarter point difference from shot to shot,"" Harris notes. Daviau particularly helped in defining the color black.""You have to realize that it isn't simply black,"" Harris adds. ""For example, the wedding scene was shot to look like 1940s Anscochrome, along with its inherent tendency to sometimes be overexposed, which in reversal means totally open whites.""For color, Willis chose an innovative combination of brassy yellow and warm red that he maintained throughout the trilogy. ""If you notice,"" he added, ""I change the visual quality throughout Part II. There's a clarity in the 1950s that isn't there in the turn of the century work, which had a softer, more diffused look; keeping the color constant binds the entire tapestry together.""The most telling enhancement, oddly enough, was to The Godfather's pivotal restaurant sequence in which Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) guns down Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) and Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden). Due to a printing error, half of it looks like a ""Xerox of a Xerox of a Xero,"" according to Harris .""The story behind that scene is quite interesting,"" he recalls. ""When Joanne Lawson, my long-time assistant, and I were going over both recent prints as well as a 1972 print shot by shot and frame by frame, we noted major problems in the sequence--many, many dupes--and called Gordon. We explained what we were seeing, and he became momentarily silent. He then broke into an interesting grouping of expletives, and explained that the shoot had been over two nights. Both were planned to have the dailies pushed by the lab. The first night came back fine, but with the second--which is inclusive of all footage after Al exits the men's room, as well as the cutaways to Sterling Hayden and a few long shots--the lab forgot to push it, and it came back very, very thin. Gordon switched labs. Technicolor Hollywood did yeoman-like work in producing dupes to attempt to match the footage.""This was one sequence that we held to the very end of the restoration,"" continues Harris, ""as we had Pro-Tek inspection technician Joe Caracappa looking through hundreds of cans from which we could attempt to harvest a better image and the sequence finally looks as it should. You can really see the tension on Michael's face for the first time.""Another challenge was figuring out what stock to print on: Eastman Vision or Vision Premier. ""We went `round and `round and did several tests and finally left the decision up to Francis, who said to go with Premier because he really liked the deep blacks,"" Yarbrough says. ""I get amazed with the digital tools that we have--we use Baselight--and that we're able to take the same negative and work some magic here and get a better looking image than what Gordon could, photo-chemically, with the right densities and image resolution.""Surprisingly, Harris, the film purist, has been won over by the digital cinema version: ""Higher resolution, steadier image, and blacks that come quite close. A beautiful image overall.""Bill Desowitz is editor of VFXWorld (vfxworld.com), part of Animation World Network (awn.com). He can be reached at bill@awn.com."	5.0	"""grain"" is purposeful.

I must say that all three floored me. Perhaps I was able to love the third film simply because I had  not heard much from other people about any of the films, so going into it I  was not affected by other opinions. I feel blessed that I was able to watch  this excellent trilogy much like one goes in reading a great novel.
