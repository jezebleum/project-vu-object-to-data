141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A1HEPFAL93AKWQ	"A. Galanter ""Higher standards for all"""	"When boxed sets of old TV series started being released I thought what a dumb idea it was. For the most part, I still feel this way. ""The Closer - The Complete First Season"" is the first TV series boxed set I spent money on. The show is fresh and full of new ways to massage the medium. Each time I view an episode again I discover more depth of character, more layers in the scripts, and one surprise after another in a show that I've watched 3 or 4 times already!! The extras are not much to write about and I hope the producers of future ""Closer"" boxed sets hire some real talent to work on them. I still give the show and the First Season release 5 Stars because I'm sure some things in the following sets will be vastly improved! Even if the extras remain at the same standard as 1, the show is brilliant enough on its own to justify the price of admission."	5.0	Even better the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th viewing!	2007-01-11	3	1	2
141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A2CHYS44ZVPJ2	Aged hippie	The Closer is one of my all-time favorite crime dramas.  The writing is exceptional, with plot twists you don't see coming.  Though almost every show has some comedic elements, they sprinkle in a few shows during each season that are more comedic than dramatic.  Nine times out of ten those involve some misadventure of Provenza and Flynn (GW Bailey and Tony Denison).  'MASH' fans may recognize Bailey as the irascible supply sgt. Luther Rizzo.  But the central character, Brenda Leigh Johnson (Kyra Sedgwick), is the reason for watching.  She closes her cases by extracting confessions in the interrogation room rather than the courtroom.In season 1, Brenda is the new chief of the LAPD Priority Homicide Division (they tried Priority Murder Section, but the acronym, PMS, had other connotations).  As an outsider from Atlanta, she meets resentment from her division who think someone within LAPD should have been promoted to chief.  During the course of the season, her division comes to recognize &#34;Miss Atlanta's&#34; unique talents and her loyalty to those who serve under her.  One by one, they all fall under her orbit, becoming a tight knit organization that solves crime in the most creative ways.	5.0	Vintage Brenda	2014-02-13	0	0	0

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A2M30FT7TTYQJG	alllie	I recently watched all the episodes of The Closer. I think the acting, writing and production were great. Each of the characters is well drawn and... imperfect. It is Brenda's imperfections as well as that of the other characters that made The Closer interesting to me. It's just a police procedural but the characterizations take it to another level. And there is character development across the series. Brenda changes as do her relationships. I was sorry the series was cancelled.	5.0	One of the best series.	2013-11-20	0	0	0

Although her southern accent slips a bit at times, Kyra is originally from New York, she does a remarkable job bringing her character to life. And the rest of the cast fit their roles perfectly, providing the backdrop Kyra needs to expand the show and her character. Overall, this show is an entertaining mixture of all things a good show should be. I love it.	5.0	The Closer - season one	2007-01-16	1	1	0

Additional plus - although I don't let me kids watch these types of shows, if I get a chance to watch it in the evening and they walk through the room, I don't have to worry about what being said or what's being shown.

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A3LJ30961CW2HK	"Amazon Customer ""Jazz Cat's Mom"""	I've been a huge fan of The Closer since the beginning.  I bought the first season because I wanted to share it with a friend. Before I did that, though, I was compelled to re-watch it and found it just as interesting the second time through.  The characters are well-developed, even in the first season and it was interesting to go back and compare their development over the seasons. Kyra Sedgwick is excellent as Brenda Johnson, but all of the supporting characters are complete individuals, as well.  The plots of the individual stories are complex and intelligent enough to be interesting, but it is really the characters and their interactions that I find most entertaining.  I've since passed this on to my friend who has also enjoyed it.	5.0	The Closer - First Season	2011-03-14	0	0	0

I had seen previews of the Closer but wasn't interested in it all. I only finally watched an epsoide when there was nothing else on it was the Housekeeper's Daughter and I was hooked ever since. Just when it looked like the killer would walk (he had fled to Mexico) Brenda has made several attempts to get him to come back to the States with no luck but she gets the confession anyways which of course is useless in the U.S. but not in Mexico since the girl he killed was a citizen of Mexico. I was floored. The rest of the eps. are excellent. The entire time is incredable each officer Flynn, Tao, Gabriel, Provenza, Daniels, Sanchez has their own personality and flaws and putting them together makes for a perfect. Its enjoyable, funny, well written and well acted. Everyone should be watching this show.	5.0	Five Stars	2007-08-07	4	4	0

I really liked it a lot, but there are so many advertising commercials that it was not a lot of fun to watch. But being able to watch it commercial-free...! I love the show! Kyra Sedgwick is so great in her role as Brenda Johnson. She has quirks. She's a good-hearted person with a steely-spine that (even when it would appear counterproductive) will NOT let minor details get in her way. Of course, I'm pretty sure that most Major Crime departments in large PDs like Los Angeles don't work things quite the way that Brenda does, that doesn't detract from the show at all. If you're a stickler for justice, no matter the cost, this show would be great for you. Only a very few episodes were not excellent; most were.	5.0	Terrific Show!	2014-02-26	0	0	0

"This is a series that just gets better as it goes along; the cover features a photoshopped Kyra Sedgwick, looking younger, and blonder, than the real Kyra. The scooped neckline number, with Kyra leaning ever so demurely forward, doesn't hurt the eye candy, either.That's called ""bait,"" as in ""put the bait, on the hook.""Ignore the ""bait,"" and bite down on the hook, and get reeled in by Kyra Sedgwick's magnificent performance.Kyra is WORTH IT!Other reviewers have criticized one aspect or another of dvd quality, but the dvd I have is more than good enough for anyone I know.This series is magnificent in its clever, intelligent, focused approach to law enforcement; Kyra Sedgwick is simply magnificent as the VERY REALISTIC, PROFESSIONAL, ""worthwhile lady"" in law enforcement.Her character is seamless to the point of being an archetype; classic, educated (but doesn't use it to intimidate), smart, quiet (but loud enough to get attention), and so good at her job that the office politicians stay awake nights plotting to discredit her.She may well be an Archetype for young ladies who would like to consider a career in law enforcement that requires smarts, spunk and savvy, but lack the drop-dead gorgeous looks of Ally Walker in ""Profiler.""She is better than all of the ""psychic detectives"" types that Marketing thinks will play to ""a woman's sense of intuitiveness.""Why?Becuase Kyra's character has 'hunches,"" but her focus is on rigorous, disciplined analysis, and using that analysis to solve the crime, AND build the case for trial. This last part is what a lot of the detective shows miss - yeah, you caught the killer, and NOW WHAT? THAT is one of the areas where ""THE CLOSER"" wins the day. Kyra is ALWAYS focused on ""The Big Picture""; the best cop I know begins his investigations by imagining the prosecutor's summation to the jury. She does that, too.Kyra's character is just perfect at bringing it all together at a professional level, while using the Gracious Southern Lady style to the hilt. Yeah, the cops he works with live to push her ANGER! buttons, but she deals with them all with the graciousness of the Mistress of Tara having to deal with the inadequacies of the Common Folk, correcting them, graciously, while ""upbringing"" them, righteously.I would play this in all public schools where young ladies would appreciate an elegant, smart, worthwhile role model, who outworks her competition, and does not use glamorous good looks to win."	5.0	brilliant, smart, clever, Kyra is MAGNIFICENT!	2006-07-10	8	6	2

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A3Q3O5KKTJURZK	Arwen Morton	"The Closer is one of my all time favorite TV Shows. I actually put off watching it originally because the previews made me think that it would be the superficial bitchy=strong trope that is often done quite poorly. I finally watched it because my husband had the season 1 boxed set, and I was hooked from the first episode. The main character (Brenda) is so well constructed and interesting, she's a great pleasure to watch. She is a very accessible heroine. In addition, it is one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen. The show also has a great balance in stories from ""case of the week"" kind of episodes and longer arcs, often well intertwining the two. All the characters have interesting development over the 7 seasons. In addition, the plots/themes show high regard for intelligence and competence. As a crime procedural, it starts out with a high emphasis on the value of ""getting confessions that lead to conviction"", meaning there is emphasis on getting confessions within legal parameters and intensely disapproving of illegal methods (inappropriate force, etc). As the show develops, there are more plots that show the tension between the moral disgust any given character may feel about a suspect in the context of the crime and the need to do their job according to the rules, which is a very interesting conflict to explore and it is very well done in this particular show. The performances are really wonderful all around. The first season (as an introductory season) is one of the best constructed I've ever seen. Kyra Sedgwick is incredible. I am totally in love with Fritz (Jon Tenney). I love J.K. Simmons in almost anything he does, and this is no exception. Captain Taylor is a fascinating character in that he has an obvious love of power, but he is not a ""bad guy"" - it's fun to watch him navigate his strong desire for promotion (power) against his passion for justice when those aspects of his personality come into conflict. The show will also be an excellent argument for why you should NEVER talk to the police without a lawyer, though not in a way that makes you dislike the police, just understand the kind of tactics the use in trying to close cases. Good police officers will give you the same warning - they do this for a living and are MUCH better at it than you. The other good balance is between ""funny"" cases/episodes and the more hard-hitting dramatic ones. Each season flows between the two very nicely."	5.0	The Closer is one of my all time favorite TV Shows	2014-07-11	0	0	0

Warners has pulled this nonsense before (namely, The OC Season 1)...""Standard Version - Presented In A Format Preserving The Aspect Ratio Of Its Original Television Exhibition"".  This is a total load of BS.  Just because someone is watching a non-HD presentation does not mean it is the ""original exhibition"".  TNT HD broadcasts The Closer in high definition people!  As far as I know no other studio puts out second-rate releases like this.  I will give you a prime example that is relatable back to this situation...Battlestar Galactica.  Most people watch first-run episodes of BSG on Sci-Fi in standard definition with black bars all around because there simply is no available HD presentation (I don't have Univeral HD on my cable system and I don't even think they show first-run episodes at the same time Sci-Fi does).  However, Universal presents BSG in anamorphic widescreen on the DVD release!!  Fox (i.e. 24, Arrested Development), HBO (i.e. Six Feet Under, Deadwood), Disney (i.e. Alias, Desperate Housewives), etc. all release shows in anamorphic.  Welcome to the 21st Century Warners!

Then, this yearI received my Kindle Fire and began watching Downton Abbey which I thoroughly enjoyed.This led me to British mysteries and, finally, back to American mysteries.  Several were too violentfor my taste.  I decided to give the 5 Star rating of The Closer another chance.  I would watch the first2 episodes.I was hooked.!  The lack of commercial interruption created continuity.  The lips still bothered me but the themes and characters pulled me in.  Each 45 minute episode addresses current problems in society withmurder and ,how Brenda Leigh and her Team work to solve it, is absorbing.In one episode  Brenda's lips were addressed by the Plastic Surgeon and this amused me but, by then,her personality and those of ALL the cast captivated me.

Right from the beginning (Season 1 Episode 1), you knew that &#34;The Closer&#34; was very special and Kyra Sedgwick was the perfect choice to bring the multi-faceted character of Brenda Leigh Johnson to life as the new Deputy Police Chief of the newly established unit known as the Priority Murder Squad. Apparently, Captain Taylor of the Robbery/Homicide Division, and many other long term detectives, did not really like this outsider from Atlanta jumping immediately to this elevated position on arrival. However, the bitter Captain Taylor was verbally chastised by Will Pope, Assistant Chief of Operations, for giving such a cold reception to Deputy Chief Johnson. In his words, Brenda is a CIA trained interrogator with excellent references from the Atlanta Police Department and a notable reputation for getting confessions that lead directly toward solid convictions. She may not be miss congeniality, but she is a &#34;Closer&#34;.	5.0	"A taste of ""Southern Comfort"" meets ""To Live and Die in L.A."" - - what a slick and marvelous concept!!!"	2013-10-14	1	1	0

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A1NSMQIF1C2VCE	Beau Yarbrough	Although it doesn't quite scale the same heights as The Shield, The Closer has to be one of the smartest and most interesting police shows on television.Kyra Sedgwick's often-unlikable deputy chief careens through Los Angeles crime like a bull in a china shop, with a bemused (or outraged) crowd of law enforcement officials in her wake. She's ably supported by a great line-up of actors, including veterans like J. K. Simmons (who will eventually appear in every crime/cop/law show) and James Avery.The middle of the season lags at times, when Kyra's character is implausibly romanced despite not being the only woman in Los Angeles, but the crimes are always interesting and the ways she deals with seemingly intractable suspects is always worth watching. By the end of the season, it's clear the creative team has found their voice, suggesting that season two will be even better.Strongly recommended for fans of cop shows, Kyra Sedgwick or J. K. Simmons.	4.0	Clever and well-written	2006-06-23	5	4	1

DAMN YESI could stop there, but i figure you should knbow the restKyra Sedgwick has labored for years as second Bananas and costarted with many stars. So in her starring vehicle, she knows how to make us watch her. She is an ex-CIA interrogator who many think she is harmless...watch her soft drawl with her brass knuckles attutude. She gets under the skin of the crime and takes us with her.This show is like Law & Order Criminal Intent with an  sharp  edge. The supporting cast interplays with Sedgwick so well, this is what true group acting is all about. Stands out in the cast include such acting talent as Jon Tenney (Brooklyn South), G.W. Bailey (in a serious role-but known for Police Academy movies), and Tony Denison (from Crime Story and Wiseguy)The DVD extras are  only deletes scenes.

The supporting cast is good, sometimes great, but anyone who loves this show has in point of fact fallen for Kyra. Or is it Brenda Johnson, the well drawn, superbly realized character, she brings to life with such nuanced verve? It's not a groundbreaking show, and stays a little too safely middle of the road in this HBO era of TV, but there's nothing to dislike here. It might not be great, but it's really very good.

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	APUQA0LGNODEE	Bookfreak	Kyra Sedgwick stars as Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson in the LAPD's Priority Homicide Unit.  The pilot shows Johnson being installed as Dep. Chief amongst great resentment of the other officers and detectives.  Her southern charm rankles others, but Johnson quickly proves her worth as a &#34;closer&#34; and expert interrogator in homicides involving political and other &#34;big name,&#34; headline-worthy victims and suspects.The &#34;whodunits&#34; of each episode are fairly predictable, so the enjoyment of this show comes from watching Johnson's character develop.  Instead of being a serious, straight-laced, organized detective, she is rather disorganized, has a secret penchant for sugar, and her southern charms toward her co-workers are always good for a giggle.Good show to watch with a family of tweens; the murder scenes are not overly gory and the show does not focus on how much violence it can get away with in each episode.	4.0	Enjoyable Watch	2014-06-30	0	0	0

He allows the female lead to walk all over him and then spit on him when he is down.  I am three seasons in to this and I may be projecting in to the future here, as the female lead gets worse as each season progresses.  She walks all over everyone.  Regardless of who it might damage.  As long as she gets her way then she is OK with it.  I dislike her character intensely.  I would give the show more starts but I can't get over the female lead.  Some one needs to make her pay attention and stop her damaging people.  If she was someone I knew in real life I would be happy tell her the truth.	3.0	The story line for the mysteries is good.

Some episodes make you laugh and some make you cry. That is the way a TV show should be. It should have meaning and be touching. It has realism. It is a story you want to watch every episode. The spin off is Major Crimes, and story within a story is fantastic. I would also recommend watching that show.

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	AXNRCPJNQ1HNJ	But I Digress	This has got to be the most challening and well-played role for a woman on TV in a long time.  Kyra Sedgwick is stellar as Brenda Johnson, the LAPD deputy chief of police who runs the Priority Homicide division.The first season does a good job of taking the time to show the initial negative reaction to her arrival, as she has come to the position from Atlanta.  One insider holds a grudge because he was hoping for her job, and the others in her department are skeptical of her abilities, at best.  Little by little, most of the people who have been with the squad for years begin to acknowledge her capabilities, while the hold-outs attempt to sabotage her work.The assorted detectives in her department all contribute as a good mix of characters, not the least of whom is Lieutenant Provenza, who played a recurring role in TV's M*A*S*H as the lazy Sgt. Rizzo.If you missed seeing this on television, it will be even better without commercial interruptions and not having to wait a week for the next episode.	5.0	Brenda rules!	2007-12-03	1	1	0
141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A8JAMLH9FMPGD	"CableTVAddict ""plwg45"""	"Everybody seems to love this show.  I really hate it.  For one, that fake southern accent of Sedgwick is really annoying. Two, the stories are hit and miss.  Only about one or two during the first season are compelling.  Three, the murderer is almost always the person least likely to be the killer - often someone who is helping Brenda in her investigation. Worst of all, few of the plots are plausible and it seems that everybody except The Closer is an idiot.  Why do all the suspects ignore their lawyers advice to shut up?  And why do they believe anything Brenda has to say?  This show is one of the worst crime shows I've ever watched.  On top of that the soundtrack is terrible, and very intrusive. It seems to be almost a parody of crime shows. Huh, maybe it is.If you like crime shows with intelligence, check out the British series ""Cracker"", about a crime psychologist that is an expert profiler and interrogator.  Unlike ""The Closer"" the stories are realistic and instead of being restricted to one episode, the story arcs for each case extend into two to three full hour episodes.Did I mention that I really hate ""The Closer"""	1.0	I Really Hate This Show	2010-11-06	29	10	19
141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A3A9BFGJCYIESF	cahjoon	An interesting and fun protagonist and premise (a southern woman from Atlanta made to lead a special crime unit in the LAPD).  The tension between her and her new co-workers provide an interesting backdrop.  Some of the cases are interesting as well but in general are somewhat simplistic compared to contemporary crime dramas.

And the charater, Chief Deputy Brenda Leigh Johnson, is just as bad as the fake accent.  The lead character is rude, self-centered and just doesn't care who she mows over.  I know it's fiction.

The plots are interesting and who doesn't love Brenda? Ok some I know don't like her because of her total lack of people skills and her take no prisoners attitude but that's what makes her so great. No pussy-footing around! She wants a confession and she gets one at the end. Sometimes she may push the boundaries a bit but I am a firm believer of punishing criminals and she feels the same way so go for it!. And sometimes the show can be very funny.

But character and merit prevailed so BLJ has EARNED not only the respect but the loyalty of the same crew that initially rejected her.  Kind of wish it were like that in real life in some places --  character and merit prevailing.....Nonetheless, this show especially Season 1(and Season 2) will withstand the test of time.

The straight woman was so repulsed that she killed the guy/woman and then mulitilated the body and this jerked around hetero woman confesses all to the star of the show without a lawyer.  This episode is so unlikely and wierd your more likely to be struck by lighting.  Therefore the end ruined the whole episode and the series with the lead role of a talented, difficult woman who is calle the B word in this episode that could have been good, a female sherlock holmes of the old variety.

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A3N3CNQD0L3HX9	David A. Franklin	This show was one of the best shows on TV. All of the really good dramas on TV have come from this new 10+ format shows that can turn out 1 to 2 seasons a year. The character development and the intelligence of characters make this show very entertaining.Every season gets better and better! The show ended but morphed into Major Crime, with out Segwick who, in my opinion, played the part of an outstanding Southern woman thrown into a California setting with great skill. Her southern accent...although as fake as a dollar bill with Obama's photo on it...was too much, but it was what added to the show. I am sure to all the people in LA, a really hard core southern accent sounds like that.If you haven't watched this, be prepared to be hooked!	5.0	We love this show	2013-02-12	0	0	0

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A3GS7XVYAK31QT	David Heeren	I became dissatisfied with TV fifteen or twenty years ago when prime-time viewing began featuring unfunny sitcoms, unreal reality shows and melodramatic dramas. At about that time they started producing DVDs of some old shows, so I decided to collect the best of them to watch anytime I please.So far I&#8217;ve bought DVDs of forty shows. I&#8217;ve found some fine shows, such as Matlock and Trapper John, which I missed the first time around. And I have been disappointed by shows such as The Greatest American Hero and The A Team, which I once enjoyed.The best recent show, in my opinion, was The Closer. Kyra Sedgwick as Brenda Lee Johnson was one of only three regular female cast members, but she more than held up her end, often in contention with numerous strong male characters, especially those played by Tony Denison, G.W.Bailey and Jon Tenney.The story lines were the best of any police show I&#8217;ve ever seen. The acting of everyone was first-rate. Even the subplots were sustained above the level of commonplace melodrama.If there was anything wrong with this show at all, it was a half-dozen episodes at the end of season seven, in which Sedgwick&#8217;s endearing character was confronted with a series of emotion-crushing incidents.Here are the ten shows I watch most often in a delightful fare of prime-time DVD viewing: 1. Little House on the Prairie; 2. Touched by an Angel; 3. The Closer; 4. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman; 5. Bonanza; 6. Hawaii Five-0 (the original show with Jack Lord); 7. The Dick Van Dyke Show; 8. Highway to Heaven; 9. Wings; 10. Jackie Gleason&#8217;s Honeymooners. This list features at least one show from every era of TV.	5.0	Opening the Closer	2013-11-20	0	0	0

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A2B1GZIRD6W646	David W. Nicholas	I typically like detective shows, especially if they have quirky, flawed characters. Kyra Sedgwick's Deputy Chief Brenda Lee Johnson is a marvelous, wonderful, funny, quirky character, with a flawed, insensitive personality. The amusing thing is that as the series goes along, she's obviously trying to figure out how to get along better with those she works with, and she generally succeeds (with one serious exception).The supporting cast is also very good. Corey Reynolds' David Gabriel is the perfect sidekick for her, veteran character actors G.W. Bailey and Tony Dennison are wonderful as Lts. Provenza and Flynn, John Tenney is wonderful as the exasperated/bemused boyfriend/FBI colleague Fritz, and J.K. Simmons is wonderful as her boss Assistant Chief Will Pope.The series's first season is especially good. For one thing, there's a plot thread throughout the first season as the whole team gets used to her, and she them. It's probably better if you watch the episodes in groups of two or three, over a period of only a few days. That will allow you to see the plot that continues from episode to episode, and that includes the whole dozen episodes. This is a very good collection and a very good series.	5.0	Excellent Series, very fun	2007-03-13	24	23	1

Her character is a mix of southern manners and charm, bumbling absent minded professor, and steely resolve. She can't parallel park a car or find her way out of a phone booth and her personal relationships are a mess, but she has this uncanny ability to see what others can't. There is humor too. In one episode her cat unexpectedly has kittens, but to her the cat will always be a boy she calls Kitty. But when it comes to work- she solves the crimes, she is the Closer.

I love the characters, although I must admit Brenda-Lee took some getting used to at the beginning.  I found the characters and how they developed was brilliant.  The plots engaged you right from the beginning and they really pulled off the more humorous ones very well.  Captain Raider made me crazy at the first but now I am a huge fan of Major Crimes too.	5.0	season 1 The Closer	2014-06-10	0	0	0

After the pilot, we couldn't wait to watch the 2nd episode.  We watched an episode each night, sometimes wanting to cheat and watch a second, but we resisted.  A great show with all emotions included.  We have literally laughed out loud with some episodes in every season.  A great crime show with real life friendships, family, life, love, heartache.  (Brenda is my new hero!)  A great way to spend 45 minutes to shut out everyday drama!!This review if for all seasons, but start with Season One!

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	ATK2HA1JWNSQK	D. Yeatman	Kyra Sedgwick has become one of the best actresses of her generation.  If you liked her in the film, Phenomenon, you'll love her in The Closer.  It's Kyra at her best.  The Closer is a character piece about a Southern woman wrapped in a TV crime solver.  Each episode is made even more compelling because the suspect must confess in order for the crime to be solved.  The script writing is crisp and poignant and the cast supports Ms. Sedgwick generously and skillfully.  Although some of the subject matter is decidely mature, this is a family show.  It has something for everyone - suspense, drama, relationships and courageous police men and women performing under incredible deadlines and odds.  Although gritty, the series is not bloody.  It is intelligent and entertaining.  Hat's off to the cast and crew for delivering an outstanding series!	5.0	Kyra Captures GA Girl Brilliantly	2006-10-29	3	3	0

I think they desserve all the awards this show has won.To tell you the truth, I don't even remember who else is on this show because Kyra outshines all of them put together. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE her character because she's tough, but yet she always knows how to ""act"" to get the criminal to talk.  I love when she goes into her little ""nice"" act to manipulate the ciminals into talking when they're in the interrogating room and they lie saying the're innocent. I highly recommend this show to anyone that likes dramas.  It has humor. The only thing I don't like is that there's usually no cliffhanger at then end of each episode.

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A13CQNO00ZM8JR	"FBsport ""FBsport"""	All the characters are well drawn, if a little &#34;over Hollywood&#34; in the sense that they are not like any &#34;real&#34; people you know. The acting is fine, but the characters, especially Kyra Sedgewick, are all pretty one dimensional in the sense that once you have seen a character in the first episode, you know them because they are always the same - real people are more complex with more variance in personality. If you like tv cop mysteries, though,  The Closer is a good one with consistently good stories that keep a viewer entertained.If I compare The Closer to my all time favorite, The Rockford Files, this is visually not as good since it is almost entirely set in what are obviously  Hollywood studio settings, not out and about on location around LA. How many times did we see Rockford at the beach, cruising around Bel Air or Brentwood or Santa Monica, in Griffith Park, or in restaurants around town?All in all, The Closer is worth watching and consistently enjoyable.

""Brenda's"" accent bugged me a bit at first, and I'm a Texan so that's saying something (grin).  But Sedgwick maintains it, true to itself, throughout each episode, and in essence, it characterizes Brenda as a definitively ""different"" personality from her LA counterparts.  Her use of a less than ""glorious"" southern accent makes the character more vivid and adds to the cognitive dissonance generated between Brenda and her coworkers.Brilliantly written and acted - FINALLY, intelligent t.v."	5.0	The Closer  Season 1	2006-06-30	3	2	1

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	AKPD9Z9W9DLF6	G. Lewandowski	Going back to the beginning reminded me of how good the acting was. Brenda was certainly a character that was hard to like at first - but the cast worked and the frustration of watching the character ignore the obvious (in her personal life) was effective at drawing the viewer into the drama.

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A19IRM8LJESDBN	Helen M.	This is one of the very few tv series that I've watched in the last 5 years. I watch it because it's smart and classy. The writing is great and the depth of characterization is also good. Brenda is fully drawn and is a real person, with faults and foibles like the rest of us. Her relationship with her team gets darn close to how workplaces evolve. The storylines are often compelling, but are secondary to how the Chief gets things done. I especially liked the line &#34;I like to know the answer before I ask the question.&#34; Good reasoning.	5.0	A series with panache	2014-02-01	0	0	0

Working nights was hard to see all the good television that has been on throughout the years. So now I am retired and playing catch up on all I have been missing with Brenda Johnson and the gang. I like how it took very little time for her team to start respecting her, and the way the story line flows from episode to episode. The entire cast has some acting skills and this has made the viewing time fly by. I find myself laughing out loud at a few of the scenes and for me that is just wholesome entertainment for adults of all ages.	4.0	Good Plots, Very Good Acting, Lots of Action	2013-08-13	0	0	0

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A14YU7HQI5U5UL	Indo	I'm sorry that I couldn't rate this higher.  I was impressed with the writing, with regard to the clever cases.  It is much more of a clever 'who-done-it' than most of the similar police detective stories.  I found that writing more similar to British detective fare than American style TV, which depends more on brain-dead action than clever plots.Unfortunately, despite the clever plots, the player dynamics are just as hackneyed as the majority of police detective TV.  I wanted to give this series four stars, but it hasn't hooked me into binge watching like some of the really outstanding series, such as The Wire, The Shield, Deadwood, etc., which, to be fair, are series.	3.0	Almost Four Stars, but Not Compelling Enough to Binge Watch.	2014-06-26	0	0	0

Although a crime drama, it gets funnier each time I watch it.  The cast is brilliant and complex.  Brenda, the main character, is a strong, smart, witty yet flawed female lead.  Her supporting cast is eqally interesting.  Each show brings a different crime.  While I find the crimes and how they solve them interesting, I am more impressed with the cast, dialog and personal interactions.  Highly recommended!

So much so that rather than be content with the TIVO recordings I made or wait for a really good price on a used copy of the DVDs, I ordered brand new DVDs. It is bad enough that TNT distracts with the logos, previews and animated characters at the bottom of the screen, they add poor editing of the broadcasts so that a scene is abruptly ended for overly-loud commercials. All of which I was hoping to avoid with the purchase of the DVDs. What a waste! The audio is horrible. There is such a variance between the audio of the episodes and the so-called ""extras"", the un-aired scenes from the broadcast episodes. I still love Brenda Lee and her crew but am embarrassed that TNT presents them in such a low class setting. I am not sure I will bother buying second season DVDs because of the lack of quality used in presenting the first season.

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A3T36HUPW95EZ9	J. Mayer	"""The Closer"" is simply the best ""cop show"" around. It has enough of the procedural background to be convincing but what makes this show so enjoyable are the characters: Deputy Chief Brenda Lee Johnson (Kyra Sedgwick) and her group of detectives, her boss and former boyfriend Chief Will Pope, and her current boyfriend/FBI Special Agent Fritz Howard.  Brenda is abrupt and abrasive but not unkind - she is simply too focused on solving the case to remember her manners, sometimes. This first season shows how she starts out as the resented outsider and wins over her elite squad of homicide detectives by closing unsolvable celebrity murders and getting full confessions from her suspects - hence her nickname ""The Closer."" By the end of season one, her team appreciates her talent and learns to live with her abrupt nature (and she learns to appreciate them a little, too).I'm not a big fan of cop shows but the personalities of these characters is what makes ""The Closer"" so watchable! Great dialogue and excellent acting.The one sucky thing about this DVD set is almost no special features - just a few deleted scenes. Some behind the scenes features, cast/crew commentary tracks, and other extras would make this a 5-star DVD set."	4.0	"For ""The Closer"" fans"	2008-04-20	1	1	0

The other characters are a fun group of archetypical bad boys - take an office comedy show and make these overgrown players cops with guns and deceit and you have her Greek chorus, to first obstruct and then admire her brilliance.  Thank goodness she has a Special Agent boyfriend and thank goodness Kyra appears to have a good marriage to a fine man.

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A3OXLZIFNE7JIH	"Joan Reeves ""It's never too late to live happ..."	"I never watched The Closer until TNT started showing reruns in the early afternoon. The time slot was always when I was taking a break from pounding the keys. I found myself kicking back with a cup of tea and getting acquainted with Deputy Chief Brenda Lee Johnson played superbly by Kyra Sedgwick.Ms. Sedgwick captures the essence of us steel magnolias and imbues the character with real personality. The funny thing about the character of Brenda Johnson is that she observes the letter of the white glove manners we were all taught at our mothers' knees, but she fails miserably in observing the spirit of those well-bred manners. In reality, she's as abrupt and irritable as any urban female out there yet she cloaks it behind the smile and utterances of, ""thank you very much.""RERUNS HOOKED MESince I'd never watched the show before, I found the reruns inspired my curiosity as to how this southern belle ended up in Los Angeles and how the Californians on her team came to accept the seemingly always angry head of Priority Murder. Not to mention how she hooked -- and managed to keep -- such a hottie as Jon Tenney who plays Special Agent Fritz Howard, her love interest.PRAISEThus I broke down and ordered the Season 1 DVD, and it's worth every penny. You've got original stories that are whodunits that keep you guessing. There's great acting by Ms. Sedgwick, Tenney, and a supporting cast made of J. K. Simmons, Corey Reynolds, Raymond Cruz, Robert Gossett, G. W. Bailey, Tony Dennison, Gina Ravera, and Michael Paul Chan.ORIGINAL CHARACTERBrenda Lee Johnson is a great character from her inability to say no to sweets to her obvious manipulations to get what she wants. I've adored Kyra Sedgwick since her role in ""Something To Talk About"" with Dennis Quaid and Julia Roberts. She was a total hoot in that film. I think she created Brenda Lee Johnson's persona from that same well of female toughness she used in that film to come up with a character who's single-minded and focused and good at really only one thing in life: solving crimes.BOTTOM LINEGet Season 1 of The Closer, and you'll spend several hours with a complicated crime-solving woman who will delight you with her intelligence, her incongruous southern manners, and her machiavellian maneuvers to get criminals to confess. You'll laugh at her inability to stay away from junkfood or to do anything well that doesn't involve police work.As Brenda Lee says, ""Thank you. Thank you very much."""	5.0	The Closer Caught Me	2011-02-12	1	1	0

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	ABTVUEZP2EA46	"Joe Fegan ""jfegan"""	Very enjoyable series, foundational to those which follow. Kyra Sedgwick is great as the protagonist who faces almost continual adversity in her new job as Los Angeles Chief of Special Prosecution. Her seasoned staff is resentful, and puts her through an initiation as if she were in a men's locker room. She stands up to them by demonstrating her very professional and insightful capabilities while interrogating suspects. She's credible even as her kooky character is full of eccentricities and southern female charm. She's a hoot!	5.0	Excellent detective series	2014-06-29	0	0	0

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A1QZ2TWRDHW9MQ	John Starace	The first season of The Closer was great. I only started watching this series the second season when it first aired on TV.I missed all the first season and I knew it was going to be good. The show was set up a lot like another show I liked, Prime Suspect on NBC. Only NBC did not give that show the time it needed to mature into what the closer did, a great hour of TV every week. I looked forward to watching the closer every Monday night. It seems the cable stations (TNT, AMC, TBS etc.) give their series time to mature and get people into them. If you've never seen The Closer (or Prime Suspect for that matter) you owe it to yourself to start watching this Emmy winning show.	5.0	The Closer Season 1	2013-08-03	0	0	0

I don't want to miss what the actors are saying and I end up turning the speakers extra loud to hear what is going on. This extra volume does not make me popular if there are other family members in the house not watching the show.I am not hearing impaired but I would bet a lot of hearing impaired customers would buy in to this great show if it had English subtitles. There is a lot of conversation going on. Unfortunately sometimes I just miss much of what the actors are saying to each other.For a great show like this you don't want to miss out on any dialogue. Almost every DVD I watch always has English Subtitles. I think they dropped the ball on this one.

These are not deep, intense shows that if you don't pay attention to every scene you lose characters and plot.  It is a light watching experience which I like.  Very good ensamble cast with good character development.  Plot lines are light.  The one thing I do like is the main character's personal life is included in each show and is part of the plot and at the end of each show, the show focuses on the main character's personal life.	4.0	Good series to watch	2013-06-05	0	0	0

The only real problem I can see is theres no way to go to the next episode from the menu page you're left to figure it out on your own.  It takes too long and becomes irritating to go all the way out to the show choices and start over which is basically what you have to do.  Amazon this is definitely something to be fixed.	5.0	The Closer Season 1	2013-02-26	0	0	0

KYRA SEDGEWICK IS BRILLIANTLY KOOKY, TALENTED, AND TOUGH. I THINK THIS FIRST SEASON REALLY SET THE STAGE FOR A LONG RUNNING SERIES WITH UNIQUE CHARACTERS AND HI-PROFILE INTERESTING CASES.TO SEE BRENDA CARVE A NICHE FOR HERSELF IN THIS MACHO-SICK MAN'S WORLD OF LAPD IS JUST A BREATH OF FRESH AIR. I LIKE PROCEDURALS AND THERE IS ENOUGH OF THAT TO SATISFY MY FACT-FINDER TASTE, AND ENOUGH PERSONALITY AND SPUNK TO SATISFY MY COMEDY/DRAMA TASTES.MOST OF THE NEW COMEDY IS GOOFY TO ME...THIS IS FUNNY IN AN EARTHY KIND OF WAY...I LIKE THAT.

Everything seems to be a sequel of this or a remake of that.  I was really beginning to think that no one had an original story to tell anymore.Thank goodness for the Closer!  Each story has a unique twist.  And the character of Brenda Leigh Johnson.  She is like most folks that are extremely talented...she is stellar in that talent, but has ""issues"" in the other facets of her life.  And the ensemble cast is excellent.The only drawback to this show is that it is only on during the summer.  It is just torture to wait 9 months for it to be on again.

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	AON9LGKSPWUBH	"K. Y. Krawczyk ""kkrawz"""	This is one of the best crime procedural dramas ever made for TV. The writing, acting and directing are all excellent. The personal storyline letting the viewer try and understand Brenda, played by Kyra Sedgewick, never takes away from the rest of the show. The viewer is getting to understand and have sympathy for a very difficult character along with her team.I've been watching this show on Amazon Prime since I missed most of the first few seasons. I never saw much of this show till it was almost over. It's great to be able to see it from the beginning and get to see how hard it was for Brenda at the beginning. She came into the LA Police Dept as an outsider and a lot of people - especially one person - really wanted her gone.If you like crime shows, you will love this one.	5.0	Closer Season 1	2013-07-13	0	0	0

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A1DZYCASJNC9BQ	Lady of the Loch	The Closer introduces Kira Sedgewick as the new head of the Major Crimes Division.The group of almost all male detectives put her through the paces, but she pushes back in gentle ways, always using her southern charm to calm a situation. The men learn to respect her as they watch her in action -- closing the deal, so to speak. Brenda gets perps to confess by expertly sidling up to them with that southern charm, disarming them. Then, like the snap of a southern gator, she latches onto the lie, the statement that doesn't match, or the arrogance of the criminal and twists them in a verbal death roll taking them down and closing the case.This is an excellent crime drama with a heart -- and a bite!

How wrong I was!  Everything about the show is outstanding.  The interaction between the characters is a pleasure to watch. Brenda has so many facets to her personality that she keeps you guessing about what her reactions will be in each situation, both on the personal and professional levels.  The photography is wonderful.  There's a great mix of subtle and obvious humor.For some reason I didn't see season 1 until after I had seen most of the later seasons, so it was interesting to see the process of how Brenda was first resented by her co-workers and then ultimately accepted into the unit.This is one of my favorite shows.  I've watched some episodes several times.  They never get old.	5.0	One of the Best Detective Shows Ever on TV	2013-03-04	0	0	0

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	AUHQBS38H5WWD	liz blevins	Kyra Sedgwick has to be the only actress I can imagine playing this role and making it believable. As Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson she comes across as a soft Southern Belle out of her element in the hard ol' world of Los Angeles, but her rivals find out very quickly there is steel under that faade. Brenda has recently joined the LAPD after a long career in law enforcement with the Atlanta and Washington, D.C. police. She is also CIA-trained, and was recruited by her former lover, Assistant Chief Will Pope. Brenda is resented as an outsider by much of the LAPD, and especially  by Robbery Homicide's Captain Taylor.  As the season progresses, we see Brenda struggle to establish her authority and earn the respect of her squad.	4.0	Southern Charm Kicks Butt	2014-04-10	0	0	0

I mean, c'mon, who wanted to watch another crime drama?? Especially one where the lead, by all appearances, was a - let's say - b*tch! Yet, I watched anyway. Just to be sure. And guess what? I fell in love with it! The teasers did not do this awesome series justice, for what I (as well as many many other viewers) saw was a very strong and driven female detective who has to put up with the bruised egos of her subordinates! Kyra Sedgwick is terrific as Deputy Chief Brenda Lee Johnson (or "". . .just plain Brenda""). This Complete 1st season set will be a welcomed edition to my TV Drama collection. And, with the premiere of season 2 on TNT just a couple months away, The Closer will become even more popular with heart-stopping episodes rich with suspense and climaxes that will take your breath away and leave you speechless!"	5.0	She gets to the truth, and is HOT to boot!	2006-04-25	42	36	6
141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A9LYWWG985U62	maciora	This show changed my expectations for writing, direction, production value and performances on network television. Characters don't fit into simple definitions or behave according to a formula; they change over time, evolve and grow. Everybody starts in one place and shift as real people do. Even the lead character isn't without serious flaws (which continue to plague her in subsequent seasons).The ensemble nature of the show doesn't overwhelm the individuals within the ensemble. nor their stories; they are all well balanced with the whole. The production seems to have avoided the pitfalls of the ongoing nature of an episodic crime procedural by keeping about the characters, not the crimes.It also really feels like a show about Los Angeles. Even the &#34;Law and Order&#34; offshoot which was set in LA failed to effectively capture the good and bad about our city in the satisfying way that this show has done.Highly recommended.	5.0	Overwhelmingly excellent television!	2013-03-06	0	0	0

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A7MEOXXTQHRPB	Marty W. Rhodes	First off, I really don't like the main character much.  I find the condescending way she speaks to people to be very irritating.  However, I recognize that this is the way the character is supposed to be played.  She is supposed to be a very unlikable person.  That's why almost all of her co-workers dislike her and that is an important part of the show's plot.  She is supposed to be very hard to like but also to be extremely good at getting suspects to confess to their crimes.  That is the main premise of this series.  So since the actress is only playing the character as it was intended to be played, I can't really fault her performance just because it annoys me.However, she has another habit that also annoys me and this one is inherent in the show's writing.  She hides important information from her team of co-workers.  This is how the script is written but anyone who has had a lot of experience at problem solving in a work environment will you that this is a very ineffective way of solving problems.  It does not matter if you are THE BEST in your field, you will still solve problems more effectively if you fully share all important information with your team and solicit input from all of them.  In this case her team mostly dislikes her and so one can understand the temptation for her to behave this way, but it is unrealistic to expect consistently excellent results from doing so.  And yet she consistently produces the best possible outcomes despite working in a way that would almost never make that happen in reality.  And, to make it worse, many of the solutions she comes up with are kind of obvious and are sometimes even logically flawed.  That also annoys me and I blame the show's writers for this flaw and I have a harder time forgiving this one.Bottom line is I think this is just an okay show.  The main character is hard to like (not the actress' fault) and the solutions are not always very surprising or sometimes even logically consistent.	3.0	This is an okay show.	2014-06-03	0	0	0

I got him hooked on the series but we both came into the series a bit late - 5th Season... and didn't know much about the background of the Characters.  This is an excellent way to catch up on the tensions and personalities that make up this enduring series.  All of the characters have evolved quite a bit from the early shows.  I know we both will go back again to review and renew the early shows.  Just like real life, you get to see what went on behind the early shows that gives us the cohesiveness present in the Show we see today.  They have all come a long way!  I highly recommend these early seasons for anyone who desires to fill in the gaps when an old ""issue"" is dragged into the frey.

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	AM8IZZP4T8LOL	Megan Hughes	I started watching this show near the end (last 3 or 4 seasons) and never saw the initial seasons.  I was so glad to find them on Amazon and have been watching an episode a night (trying to control myself !!:))  Kyra Sedgwick is a fine actress and her team of initially aghast but gradually admiring officers and detectives are a perfect fit.  I'm no genius so I almost never figure out &#34;who-dunnit&#34; until close to the end, if then.  But what is really great about this show is the way Kyra/Brenda slowly and diabolically lures the guilty party(s) into her web and then socks it to them.  I am thrilled to say that the follow-on to this show, Major Crimes, starring Mary McDonnell (and most of the original team) is JUST AS GOOD!	5.0	One of the best dramas out there	2013-07-21	0	0	0

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	Kyra Sedgwick eats up the screen with her on-target, totally off the wall performance as Brenda Lee Johnson, THE CLOSER for LAPD's special high profile division.  Oozing Southern charm or annoyance, Sedgwick dominates the series with her unique body tics, her goofy smile, and that magnolia scented accent.  Rarely has an actress dominated a tv crime series as well as Sedgwick.  Her cases are sometimes complex but involving, and her resolutions usually rewarding.  It's fun to watch the first season and see how long it takes for her team and boss to completely warm up to her, and she benefits from a superb supporting cast, particularly JK Simmons as her boss and former lover, Pope; Corey Reynolds as the glib but stoic Gabriel; the delightfully deadpan GW Bailey as Lt. Provinzo; Tony Denison as the smug arrogant Flynn; Michael Chan as their forensics expert, Lt. Tao; and Jon Tenney as her FBI lover and best friend, whose warmth tempers Kyra's mental lapses.All in all, THE CLOSER is a superb crime series and delightful to get involved with.	5.0	SOUTHERN DISCOMFORT	2006-09-22	3	3	0

During the first episodes of the series it was interesting to watch &#34;The Closer&#34; gain rapport with a suspect to obtain a confession using conversation instead of brutality.  But there are only so many ways this can be portrayed in a manner that is new and fresh. I enjoy Kyra Sedgewick, and IMHO she has a talent that is often underrated.  However, after a couple of episodes, I found the vague disorganization in her personal life annoying, and the &#34;conflict&#34; between her boss ( a onetime lover) just banal.	3.0	This Series Would be Less Than Average if not Well Carried by Kyra Sedgewick	2013-09-29	0	0	0

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A1DPPIN5IPQAN7	"M. Massey ""cszerlulu"""	Brilliant casting raised this show from being just another female cop show.  They also went against what seemed to be the norm - where a female is promoted and everyone is out to get her.  In this case she did come in with that sense of resentment, but episode by episode she wins over the members of her team, in fact, it is that which makes season 1 my favorite of all the seasons.  It was a star vehicle written for Kyra Sedgwich, but the secondary cast is outstanding.  They added some of the best character actors who had been in the business for years, and new ones to keep an eye on - in fact it was no surprise that they were so popular they kept them together for the follow up series.  Jon Tenney's character is the perfect partner, loving her with all her flaws, but standing up to her when she has stepped over the line.  You can actually see the affection that J.K. Simmons' character has for Brenda,  G.W. Bailey and Anthony John Denison are fabulous as the older detectives and I was happy to see that the new show kept their focus episode.  The only thing that I ever found odd was that they never made Gina Ravera a regular.  She was there for a while, but wasn't in all the episodes, so it was almost like she was added at the start with the knowledge of how she would exit seasons later.	5.0	Casting elevates this show	2013-02-26	0	0	0
141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A23D2NK282EW1D	M. McCann	I bought the DVDs from another vendor, but am leaving my review here because I feel that it will get more attention than if I just complain to their employees.  TNT... seems to hate people with hearing impairments.  This show's quality is five stars.  This DVD's lack of subtitles for the hearing impaired makes it impossible for me to enjoy one of my favorite TV shows of all time.  Watching this makes me feel discriminated against.  TNT (or whoever made the DVD) took the time to think that hey, maybe French or Spanish speakers/readers might want to watch this too, but dismissed the notion that people with hearing disabilities might also enjoy watching it off hand.  Don't buy this DVD.	1.0	Five star TV show.  No star closed captions.	2013-10-29	6	5	1

Brenda, the lead character played by Kyra Sedgwick, is such a uniquely drawn character. She's smart, yet humorous in a way that is similar Peter Falk's Columbo. My husband and I are both enjoying the series. We find the lead characters to be interesting and believable. Great writing and story lines, too.

It is a typical police type show but with very good acting and not so much violence.  Kyra Sedgwick's character is a southern firecracker and really makes the show a joy to watch.  You don't see all the violence, just the result which is where Brenda ( Kyra S ) is called in. I was gratified to see the show runs for quite a few seasons.	5.0	The Closer	2013-03-14	0	0	0

This does not take away from the detective work, but makes it a lot more fun.  The cops are all kooky and the episodes are fast paced.  Deputy Chief Brenda Lee Johnson has a reputation of a closer mainly due to her exceptional interigation skill.  Her skill with case work eventually begins to win over her less then zeolous department.  Well worth starting to watch and adding to your DVD collection.	5.0	Good cases and funny	2006-08-07	11	9	2

Often witty and funny (in no small part to The main character, Brenda), the is a real sense of chemistry between all parties and a great sense of development that really has you believing in the reality of these LAPD officers. As for the crimes depicted in each episode, they're all very well written and more often then not they continue to puzzle the viewer instead of trailing them along with over predictable crimes. Though I'd have to say the beef of the show really lies in the actions and words exchanged between Brenda and the cast of her newly appointed Homicide investigations team. It's a fantastic show that definitely has warranted the fan base it's built.	5.0	A crime show deserving of attention	2013-01-23	0	0	0

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A1YKHVDVNKFYQ9	Phoebe	Before this series went on air I went to the TNT website and read up on it. I found it to be very interesting and seeing how I'm not a TV buff like some people, I fell in love with it. However, I had never heard of Kyra Sedgewick's name until this show and I didn't know she had previously acted in movies. I have never been a fan of TV Shows because I find most of them are really stupid. I was amazed by the storyline in this TV series and after watching the first episode I fell in love. I don't mind Kyra's accent in this show because she does a good southern accent and while some of you might disagree she does over do it at times, which is true, she does to her best at acting. Each member of her squad has unique personalities and together they solve murders committed in California. I enjoy the way Brenda and Fritz's romance starts up and finally becomes steamy near the end of season one. The DVD quality is just as it is presented in the description but I have don't have any problems with the sound quality. I've watched the DVD's four times since I got them. If you wall don't have TVIO then buy this set. It's worth the money. If you like NCIS I am sure you'll enjoy this one.  10 out of 10.	5.0	Season 1 - Superb	2007-06-21	3	3	0

My problem with this series is that it presents a slanted, biased liberal point of view.  As a conservative Catholic, I am appalled at the one line shots delivered at my faith, (i.e. the derisive way that Brenda will refer to the Pope, with contempt in her voice and demeanor) to the plots that are outright slanderous...in this set, you will be treated to someone who viciously murders someone because of her Catholic faith and its intolerance towards homosexuality.  Hatred is not part of Catholicism, but on more than one occasion, that's presented as the main ingredient of our faith.  Deplorable. Maybe Kyra and crew are guilty of more hatred than anyone.If you're a liberal minded person, you'll love it.  If you're someone who holds conservative Christian values, beware that this show is a subtle and sometimes not so subtle piece of indoctrination.I threw this set into the garbage, where it belongs.	1.0	Gripping plots, bad messages	2011-09-06	19	0	19

The fish-out-of-water aspect of an Atlanta cop taking over a predominantly male department in L.A. is only part of what makes this show so great. Brenda in the interrogation room is something to behold. I remember Columbo from my childhood, and I've begun collecting the DVD collections. I understand the comparisons of Brenda to Lt. Columbo, because on the surface, both appear inept. It's not often that a ""crime show"" can both satisfy the amateur detective in you, and make you laugh out loud -- but The Closer does just that in EVERY episode.Brenda's quirks are endearing, and as she earns the respect of the men who work for her in the later episodes of the first season, there are many moments that equal the high emotion of feel-good blockbuster movies.You simply can't miss.I'm a little confused by people who absolutely hate this show yet buy the DVD box set.

I never saw the series from the beginning and now I wonder what I was thinking when I used to skip it. The writing is terrific and Sedgwick's character has idiosyncrasies that are comical and leave the viewer to come to their own conclusions. The references to various places in Los Angeles are accurate and some locations are easily recognizable. It's too bad the series ended but eventually all good things must come to an end.

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	AT9BXQGG1TUVY	Rambonrse	"I have found The Closer mesmorizing and thought provoking trying to unravel the mystery as Deputy Chief Brenda Lee Johnson works the case with her special homicide unit. The cast is absolutely THE BEST and their growing respect for their Chief is the underlying premise through all the cases in this first year. Kyra Sedgwick is outstanding playing the role of a strong, highly intellectual, southern woman that is more than competent in her role as Chief, but who has a difficult time gaining the trust and respect of her detectives.  Captain Taylor, played by Robert Gossett, is a jealous, malicious, ""small minded"" individual that isn't beyond lying or exaggerating situations about Chief Johnson to have her removed from her job. This is because he was next in line to be Deputy Chief and was passed over for promotion for this southern belle that doesn't do her job like anyone ever has from the LAPD's perspective.The script moves quickly and draws in multiple scenes from Brenda's home life to show that she is just an average human being with weaknesses and pitfalls that she has to relate to. The dialog between characters is witty and will pass you by if you are not listening closely. There are also some great non-verbal gestures that help make a complete picture of the various individuals that are working with Brenda on her squad. There is subtle as well as outright humor. My favorite is in the Season 1 finale where a crime scene has been taped off and all her detectives are there except for her and Sergent Gabriel (Corey Renolds). Sergent Provenza is the senior detective on the scene and some light banter starts about who is in charge of the scene. Provenza (G.W. Bailey) then flows into a beautiful southern drawl and graceful walk and approaches all of the other detectives, mimicking the Chief, to give them their assignments on the case, making sure he adds politely ""Thank you"" after each request as Brenda is known for doing. The rest of the team is laughing and having fun with this routine when in walks Dept. Chief Johnson. She knows that she has been paid a major compliment by her team with their joking, and she actually supports Provenza's recommended delegations. And as she leaves the crime scene she reminds her squad that the  crime tape needs to remain up until everything is looked at and waits for Provenza to finish her usual sentence, ""because this is a crime scene, yaall"".Season 1 was nominated for a number of awards for both Sedgwick and the entire ensemble cast for their work this past season.The DVD has bonus coverage of unaired scenes - scenes that were cut during final editing for each show that provide a little more character development.If you haven't seen The Closer on TV yet - it is on Monday nights at 8CST/9EST on TNT."	5.0	"Don't miss the best new TV drama from 2005 - ""The Closer"""	2006-06-27	4	4	0

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A2XOV3ZKGDK55G	"RBSProds ""rbsprods"""	"Five Fabulous Stars! The police drama, ""The Closer"", will open your eyes as Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson cracks each case by making them talk! It is that rarest of cable episodic shows: a clearly successful show on both a ratings and critical level that can slug it out with 'Big Four' network shows; and that has translated into a full order of second season shows. I only wish we could get 22 episodes per season from the cable networks. But the fact that it's on TNT, a network that prides itself on ""We know drama!"" , really helps. When was the last time you saw ANY network add 10 minutes to a season one finale or present the second season opener ""commercial free""? Am I the only one who was fascinated by those early trailers that showed a ticked-off Brenda leaving the interview room in a huff, while the accused lady demanded she get back in there and continue the questioning?  Wild stuff, for sure. I was hooked by the trailer, but the series pilot episode reeled me in. LOL. And the following S-1 episodes were just as strongly written and acted.Sporting a well-known star and a cast of fairly well-known character actors, ""The Closer"" is a revelation to those who haven't found this TNT show yet. Kyra Sedgwick is an amazing actress for those who don't know her work, and her characterization of Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh  Johnson stands out like a beacon among the best TV lead female characters in recent memory: a somewhat odd, sometimes humorous, but very determined police detective, who is not to be messed with. And it is great to see J. K. Simmons, Dr Emil Skoda on ""Law & Order"" and ""Spiderman 2"", get a well-deserved major role. Jon Tenney, Robert Gossett, G.W.Bailey, Anthony John Denison, and Tony-nominated Corey Reynolds round out the excellent ensemble. This show has me ""DVR-ing"" the network shows, so I can watch ""The Closer"" first.

First seasons are the best -- the characters are developed by the plot, not the other way around, and you have to feel for the nasty sexism of the police department that this oddball Georgian moves into.

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A24UC8CGHIG8FD	Ryan S Counts	The Closer is a fantastic crime drama that brilliantly blends comedy and drama. Kyra Sedgwick anchors the show as Brenda Johnson; her performance is nothing short of excellent and hysterical. The show reminds of Monk in some ways because Brenda, like Monk, has quirks and a big personality, that are amusing, yet make her difficult to work with. Also, both shows tend to have coincidences that happen towards the end, which help the main character realize who did it and how. The Closer, unlike Monk, is much more heavy and deals with more gruesome crimes and details. The show also stands apart in an overblown and conventional genre, by focusing on interrogations, which are the signature moments on the show. So, yes 5 stars for a refreshing, yet familiar take on crime drama because it is just so enjoyable.	5.0	The Closer: Great Crime Drama with some Comedy	2014-03-29	0	0	0
141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	ANZM5ZV2XIENB	Ryna	"The Closer is the first crime drama I've really gotten into. Its complex story lines are exciting and mind-bending. The Closer has a really great cast of characters, full of all sorts of different people, who help round out the entire show. Kyra Sedgwick, who plays the main character, interrogator Brenda Johnson, is one of the best actresses I've ever seen.One of the things I really like about The Closer is how it is less graphic, visually, and tends more toward the intellectual side: most of each episode is spent trying to find out who committed a crime, and why.Although with some shows, later seasons are better than the earlier ones, the first season of The Closer is as fascinating and exciting as later episodes.For anyone who is interested in this sort of genre, you definitely should give The Closer a try. Its complex story lines, relationships, and exciting ""last ten minutes"" will keep you pulled in until the credits roll.This four-disc set includes the pilot episodes. Two separate plastic cases (each holds two discs) are held inside a cardboard slipcase."	5.0	Very good crime drama, more intellectual, less graphic	2011-03-18	3	3	0

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	AALGGOHOLTG2D	Sandra K. Barbour	I have always really liked Kyra Sedgwick in all of her movies.  I did not care for the character she played in, The Closer, or the same old plot line in every episode.  The only character who was the least bit interesting to us (my husband and I) was Sgt. Gabriel, played by Corey Reynolds.  I think we saw about 3 or 4 episodes.  There was one scene that was sort of cute/funny, and that was when Sgt. Gabriel asked her if she could find her way back after picking up a suspect, because she was so new to town and didn't really know her way around.  Otherwise, for us the story lines were so predictable, we got bored.  Sorry.	2.0	Not For Me	2014-02-20	0	0	0

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A1H2O4ES4WPIQA	Sanjay Shankar	I started watching 'The Closer' only from the middle of S2 when it was on air and followed it all the way to the finale.  I was happy to see that S1 was available on Amazon Prime.  I was curious about how Brenda got to LA etc.  I thought it was ok, nothing spectacular.  The country music in the background is fairly heavy in S1 compared to the other seasons and was even drowning out the dialog in some places.

Not only is the plot week, but the acting is poor, especially the supporting cast. Since this show gets so much good buzz, maybe it gets better as the season progresses, but then again, 2 and Half Men gets good reviews and it is mindless drivel.	1.0	Horrible 1st episode	2008-05-06	24	4	20

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A19KXPQ9X3OCJ7	Sea-Lassie	"My husband and I recently discovered The Closer and in terms of light and easy entertainment, we are enjoying it!Kyra Sedgwick portrays a chief deputy detective who has recently relocated from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Her character, Brenda Johnson, is intelligent and determined yet quirky and even a little goofy at times...all of which make her very likable.Chief Deputy Brenda Johnson is a skilled interrogator and her seemingly forgetful and innocent approach with suspects reminds me of the legendary Columbo...in a good way. In addition to solving murders, Brenda is challenged with proving her detective skills and leadership abilities in a mostly male-with-fragile-egos workplace.Although some of the story lines can be far fetched and the main suspect often too obvious, the show has a strong supporting cast and is well written with interesting dialogue between the characters.The main distraction in this show, for me, is the twangy southern accent of Kyra Sedgwick's character, most especially the number of times she says ""Thank you, thank you very much"". I'm hoping as the show develops these words will be repeated less frequently.For parents wondering about the content and appropriateness of The Closer for family viewing, the show is focused on murder investigations so there is some violence and gore but it is relatively free of bad language, nudity, and there are very few sexually suggestive scenes.Thank you, thank you very much!"	3.0	"""Thank you, thank you very much"""	2013-04-19	0	0	0

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A3RWI3EH4NW5G8	"Stefanie ""Bookish Grrrl"""	The Closer is a fantastic show - similar to many of the other police shows on tv, it deals with the horror of the violent side of life and death in LA. It is unique in its portrayal of a tough, honest, and supremely-motivated homicide investigator, Brenda Leigh Johnson (Kyra Sedgwick). Johnson is a compelling character - as her squad and viewers quickly find out. Well worth watching all the seasons of this excellent show!	5.0	Fantastic show!	2009-12-29	0	0	0

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A2IXJ1WB1034E2	"Steve Fuson ""comics geek"""	"I was genuinely surprised by this show.  I don't normally like police dramas.  I find that there isn't enough in the story about the actual police characters for me to empathize with them, so since I don't care about the main characters I don't care about what's going on.  Also a lot of police dramas do quick cuts between scenes, like one scene will only last for the twenty seconds it takes one character to say ""Bring so-and-so in for questioning.""  I find it really disorienting.But I loved The Closer.  It's about a woman from Atlanta who is given a position as Chief of a Priority Homicide unit in Los Angeles.  This unit handles high profile cases like the deaths of actors or government officials.  Initially her team doesn't like having someone from outside come in as their boss, and her no-nonsense attitude to work doesn't endear her to anybody.  But as the series progresses and they see how smart she is and the results that she gets they develop a respect for her.""The Closer"" refers to the main character's ability to get confessions out of her suspects so that not only is the person arrested but they're much more likely to get convicted.  And she doesn't threaten or beat a confession out of them, she uses psychology to get them to admit what they've done and why.This show has complicated mysteries, ones where you find yourself participating in the mystery yourself, making guesses as to who really did it.  All the characters, both the one episode characters and the show's regulars are all developed well, and you end up caring about all of her team, even the ones we know almost nothing about.  The show has real drama and great emotion.And it's funny!  The main character buys a house and there's a cat that was living there.  She never wanted a cat, she doesn't like having a cat, but she feeds it, and becomes attached to it.  She never names the cat other than calling it Kitty, and she refuses to stop refering to it as 'he' even though the cat has kittens.If I had to equate this show to anything I would say it's closer to the show ""Monk"" than ""CSI.""  It's smart, fun, and charming.  It's still a drama with a little bit of comedy, not the other way around, and parts of it can be quite brutal, but every episode is a complicated whodunnit with some interesting twists at the end."	5.0	Great Show	2006-06-26	0	0	0

But, I got caught up in The Closer in the middle of season one. And I got my husband hooked on it early in season two.The storylines are very interesting and the premise of the show is all about the deputy chief of priority homicide, Brenda Lee Johnson getting not only evidence of people's guilt but also getting a confession out of them that will stand up in court.We enjoy all the other characters in the show as well. The producers certainly chose the right actors for the job and it shows. My only regret about this show is it only puts out 12 or 13 episodes a year and the wait in between seasons is too long.

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A1SDPA1J98UP4L	"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf"""	"I love The Closer because it is both funny and serious at the same time.  Brenda Lee has her share of quirks.  She is a strong woman and what makes her awesome as a strong woman is she is in no way ""Overly Butch"" in a position of authority working with men who are hard edged cops.  I especially liked how most of the people she worked with did not actually like her when she arrived as a new fresh southern belle out of Georgia.I liked how the script writers had the men of her unit making snide fun at her accent and odd mannerisms behind her back and some did things to undercut her authority earlier on.  I liked how over time the writers gradually showed how she earned the respect of those who worked with her.  I like how she uses her southern charms to disarm some and flare up with fire and passion to others as needed.  The writers give Brenda Lee added demension as a character.  I like how they show how she thinks and eliminates aspects of the crime details till she reaches the solution.  While I loved Columbo in many ways and made it my business to buy every Columbo series from [...], I think Brenda Lee is his equal and is somehow made more real by her weird character flaws and quirks.Yes it would be way nice IF they added lots of featurettes and extras you see in DVD releases of mainline series but, for the money this is an awesome value.  I'd much rather enjoy all of the Closer Series than pay tons more for a few extras.  I must admit I Brenda Lee's gentle southern Georgia down home just plain folky accent is one of the biggest turn on's for me.  All things considered I like the closer because, the scripts are great the acting is great. Most of all I love the closer because the Brenda Lee character is full of heart, passion, down home plain old fashioned humble beginnings southern charm while being still an awesomely intelligent strong woman who speaks her mind.  Futhermore Brenda Lee regularly stands her ground with guts and gusto in a male dominated field a trait I think most young ladies need to see so they have a better chance of growing up to be strong, intelligent and self assured.  The weird wide screen format was a stupid decision on the studios part who knows why studio executives make the dumb choices they so often do.You can't beat the price od the closer when you factor in the sheer number and quality of the programs you get for this DVD investment.  If you like crime mystery and drama with a tinge of southern charm buying The Closer from [...] is a no brainer.

Moreover she holds the whole cast of diverse characters together as an effective team. Especially enjoy the development of relationship between her and her boyfriend &#34;Fritz&#34;.

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	ABLBRUT8DALNN	Todd Smith	The Closer is a top notch police drama the likes of which television has never seen. For the past 6 years, Kyra Sedgwick has played Chief of Major Case Squad, Brenda Lee Johnson. The series starts out when an old colleague, Chief Pope (J.K. Simmons), asks her to come from D.C. to L.A. to run a brand new division within the LAPD. She accepts and nobody is happy about it. They resent her for many reasons, such as, her past relationship with Pope, the fact that she's an outsider, the fact that she's a young woman, take your pick. Her job is to improve the closure rate on high profile crimes, but at the same time she's fighting her own people just to get things done. Sedgwick is absolutely amazing as Brenda Lee Johnson. She is such a smart woman and it shows in the way she portrays the Chief. The supporting cast are all terrific, and are in fact veterans of such successful shows as Oz, Law & Order, and MASH. If you like cop shows, crime dramas, or even just a good old fashion mystery this is the show for you! It's 7th and final season begins on TNT in late June and it's gearing up to be the best one yet!	5.0	The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078	2013-02-23	0	0	0

In this case, however, it's more like a thin coating of zinc on iron. For my tastes, having lived in the south and in California, Kyra Sedgwick brings no more than a caricature to the part. The scripts don't help as they are plotted like a paint-by-numbers project.  If you're bed-ridden and cannot change the channel, limp on through this series. Otherwise find better uses of your time.  No, I did not see the full series.

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A3O8FSRVDH2T7J	"VideoPhile ""j_cole"""	Let's start with a simple confession (of my own).  I Do Not Like Kyra Sedgewick.  Not 'I don't like her character', I do not like the actress.That is the single flaw in this otherwise intriguing police drama.This show finds a unique place among the plethora of police/forensic shows out there.  Somewhere between Monk and Law & Order's Criminal Intent, this show focuses on the hardest part of police work: Interviewing witnesses & suspects and obtaining confessions that would really stand up in court.The attention is in the details.  One can follow the line of reasoning to discover the 'culprit' if one tries.  I like that.  The fact that while there are few convoluted plot twists, the answer isn't like the obscure murder/mystery while at the same time it is not dropped on the table without suspense.It's hard to say I really like this show at the same time disliking the actress playing the lead - that is a credit to the writers, director, and I have to admit, Kyra Sedgewick.The Character (Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson) has enough flaws to be human while being good enough at her job to keep from being fired - like others have said a strange presentation...At the same time, like other good dramas, things don't always work out - she's not a Canadian Mounty - she doesn't always 'get her man' - and she doesn't always get the confession.  Even when she does, in some cases, it is bitter fruit - like the episode when the really bad guy gets to walk because someone else confesses...  I'm sure that guy will be back in Season 2 or 3, and yes I'm waiting for their release on DVD.I only 'wish' someone else had been cast in the lead, but I'm having a hard time imagining who - but it is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.	4.0	A twist to the average crime drama/forensics show...	2006-08-21	11	7	4

There are re-runs on TV, but they are always shortened to make room for more commercials.The Closer is a perfect combination of mystery, comedy, and action.  Brenda's dry method of handling her people along with Provenza's subtle wit make the series fun to watch multiple times.  Some episodes are, of course, better than others, but they all work together to create a family of characters who become friends over time.	5.0	Great series.	2014-04-10	0	0	0

While we were impressed enough to purchase Seasons 1-3, we were amazed at how much we missed by having missed the earlier episodes and the development of the characters.Unlike MASH and some other weekly TV shows, one quickly finds that when they view from the beginning of Season One and progress through the series in order that each show builds on an earlier show.We debated on making this purchase, but we believe it has enriched our lives and was certainly most enjoyable.	5.0	Purchased First 3 Seasons - What A Buy!!!	2009-01-14	0	0	0

The Provinza character breaks me up at least once per episode.  My favorite is when the bad guy takes off with the whole squad in pursuit except Provinza.  His line is ""I don't chase.""

"A great well written show with great performances and direction, ""The Closer"" focuses on Deputy Chief of Police Brenda Leigh Johnson (Kyra Sedgwick) is a fish out of water lured from Atlanta to L.A.by Assistant Police Chief Will Pope (J.K. Simmons J.J. Jameson from ""Spider-Man"" and ""Spider-Man 2"") lead an elite unite that tackles high profile murder cases with her unusual approach to solving crimes. Her Georgia accent immediately sets her apart from her colleagues. She's much savvier underneath her down home accent than many give her credit for allowing her, like Columbo to tackle crimes that others might not be able to solve. Like Columbo and Monk she's got her own quirks (an addiction to junk food, she shows up at a crime scenes with her sick cat--named Cat--in a paper back and her southern charm can't quite hide her abrasive personality). It's a marvelous TV show with a terrific supporting cast (Jon Tenney, Robert Gossett among others). Unlike Columbo this show is much harder edged.""The Closer"" is presented in a goofy looking presentation; the show is presented in widescreen but because its not anamorphic when you watch it on a widescreen TV the images are stretched or boxed on the sides, bottom and top.  The presentation is rather bizarre and I can't quite figure out why they made this idiotic decision but, again, the show looks quite good despite this flaw. The colors are accurate with accurate skin tones. The show has a significant amount of dark sequences but that's the way the show is shot with lots of use of shadows and moody lighting dominating the look of the series. The audio sounds fine and is presented in 2.0 stereo surround as it was originally broadcast. It's primarily dialogue driven so there isn't a huge amount of surround type of effects.Unfortunately there are no featurettes on the development of the series, how Kyra Sedgewick became involved in the show, interviews with the supporting cast or a glimpse into the creative process of the show. We get deleted scenes for the bulk of the episodes (they were clearly cut for time constraints) presented with the time code at the bottom of the images so clearly most were cut prior to the final assembly of the show. No commentary tracks which is disappointing but the price is right for the show and it's presented in thin packs making it easier to store the DVDs without taking up much room.Well written, performed and directed ""The Closer"" looks solid in its DVD presentation but could be improved significantly for the second season. I'd suggest that Warner present the show anamorphically enhanced and include some featurettes or commentary tracks in addition to the deleted scenes. This top notch show one of the best of the season deserves a deluxe treatment but because it's on TNT and has a smaller audience it's unlikely we'll probably see either one of these improvements for future"	4.0	Great show, goofy presentation	2006-05-24	126	118	8

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A3DSXFFPEL0RI0	Whipster	Kyra Sedgwick's character on The Closer doesn't look like she'd be a tough cop.  She's pretty, she's got a lovely southern drawl, and a great sense of style.  But cross her and you'd better be wearing protective gear next time you see her!  She doesn't pull her punches.  She's got a keen intelligence and a sharp tongue.  Give her a challenging case to solve, and she's in her element.  Her interview style is untraditional and her fellow cops - resentful and resistant in the beginning - slowly begin to acknowledge and appreciate her skill and and sharp insight.  Don't miss it!	5.0	Looks Can Be Deceiving	2013-10-15	0	0	0

141983049X	The Closer: The Complete First Season	A3MNYGLP7ISJEJ	wilmafay	Once I can get the show going it's great, but I have to restart the video usually at least three times, sometimes more before it will play without interuption.  I gave a strong wifi signal and the Kindle is not even a year old so I have no idea why I have so much trouble getting the videos to run smoothly.  It's very frustrating to say the least.  All I can say is I'm glad The Closer is worth all the trouble!	5.0	"Love the show - the ""delivery"" is lousy"	2013-02-10	0	0	0

This show has a strong female lead who knows her stuff and is not afraid to show what she knows.  But, she is not fool-hearty and knows how/when to ask for help.  She successfully and professionally handles her hang-ups and doesn't allow them to corrupt her presence with her team.	5.0	Love this Show!	2014-06-28	0	0	0
