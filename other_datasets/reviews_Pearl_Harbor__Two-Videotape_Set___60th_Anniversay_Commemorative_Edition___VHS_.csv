B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A7OJCBMP5M4KI	16x9 aspect ratio	I absolutely hated this movie.  This movie is an absolute disgrace and a disservice to all the people who died on that tragic day.  The biggest complaint I have about this sick mess is that Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay have taken a serious and somber subject like Pearl Harbor and thrown in a silly love triangle involving hearthrobs Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale to appeal to the MTV crowd which of course is a huge market for the movie industry.  That's what I dislike about Bruckheimar and Bay namely how they make big, lavish, loud, dumb-downed movies just so they can appeal to mainstream audiences.  Bruckheimer and Bay are the Britney Spears of filmaking.  Why am not I talking about the movie?  Because there's nothing about the movie that's worth mentioning!!  Don't waste your time.  If you want to see a good chick flick then see A Walk To Remember or if you want a good war movie then watch Tora Tora Tora.	1.0	What a joke	2002-03-17	6	4	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3128SLAYOGIIC	"""4german4"""	Actually, I'm not American and I think that's why Iwas really laughing about that movie. The best part was, when they told us &quot;KAMIKAZE&quot; was invented by Americans &lt;lol&gt;. I saw documentations and real pictures and the Japanese bombed Pearl Habour out of the frame, there was no time to start two airplanes and kill all the Japanese. Well, the love story, if there was any, was that sort of unbelievable und cheap that I really felt ashamed for the director. In my country this movie was in cinema for about 4 weeks and during this time nobody went to watch it.	1.0	Wow, never seen bull**** like this before....	2001-07-25	11	5	6
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2ZUBWBWZSXJ03	5 stars inspite of the complainers......	Wow.  I guess I expected some negative feedback on this movie.  I mean, it was a big one.  And, you know what they say....you can't please all of the people all of the time.So much complaining about the love story...why is that?  How can you feel true apathy unless you are invited into a persons life.  You have to know their story.  Otherwise, you are just looking at them like, &quot;What the hell is wrong with you?  It is just a little smoke an fire.&quot;  Now, I might agree that they whole love triangle might not have been necessary.  However, things were different in the 40's. The men then were truly men of honor and courage.  They saw their first priority was to defend their country.  The angry people of the world probably don't care about this, but it is still true.  I wouldn't have bet two cents on the honor and courage of many of the people in this country before Sept 11.In any case, I can't believe that some of you can write a review so harsh that it loses its meaning.  No one likes to listen to a bitcher.  So, those of us who are sick of all the negativity just scroll right past.  If you are going to argue, please do it a little more effectively.  The movie was good.  It wasn't great, but it was good.  PH was worth going to see on the big screen and worth renting or owning.  The personal stories only brought it a little closer to home and put it in perspective.  I have much more respect now that I ever did from watching the scrathcy black and white footage from history class.  I think the film makers did what they set out to do.  They have honored the men and women who fought and died that fateful December day.  5 stars*****	5.0	Why so harsh??	2001-12-06	15	4	11
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3OVT5GYRTKRSX	"70spe ""70spe"""	"When ""Pearl Harbor"" came out three years after ""Saving Private Ryan"", I was hoping for a similar dramatic blockbuster that infused admirable and likable characters into an action-filled, heart-tugging, and well-directed/produced movie.  Instead (and how can I articulately put this?) well, quite frankly, it sucked.The acting was extremely poor in the lead roles (Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale).  Even with the number of high-quality actors in it (i.e., Jon Voight, Cuba Gooding Jr., Alec Baldwin, Josh Hartnett, etc.) they were not enough to save this film.The special effects, however, were quite remarkable and one of the few bright spots in this cinematic bummer.  Unfortunately, these first-rate effects didn't make up for the awful acting."	2.0	A Big Disappointment	2007-01-26	4	2	2

The scene of the bombing of Pearl Harbor put you right inside the hearts of the scared and dying men. The love story is the story inside the story- totally awesome.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3R1FYXRLC6SS4	Aaron	"One of the big questions about the four-disc edition of Pearl Harbor is just what exactly they changed in the director's cut. ...Of course, the most noticeable change is the addition of gore in the many battle scenes. The carnage includes:* Limbs flying. In scenes with explosions where sailors were just knocked away in the old edition, they now lose arms and legs. In addition, a quick new scene was edited back in where one sailor is brutally spun and tore up by an explosion.* A severed head is seen rolling right in the camera frame with chunks of ""meat"" dangling out.* The Captain is seen holding his intestines in his hands when Cuba comes to his aid.* More gore can be see in the many strafing sequences with chunks of arms and legs being torn out.* Severed hands and legs can be seen lying around in the hospital sequence's.Besides those additions, there were a few quick cuts here and there throughout the film. With the state of the art DTS surround mix and widescreen picture this pack is the top of the line for a Pearl Harbor movie fan, but how ever for the first time ever the dvd studio used cardbord case's to hold all 4 dvd's, now that is a very BIG no no. Don't buy it if you want to keep it longer than 12 months or when you do buy it go out and buy 4 dvd case's to put all of the Pearl Harbor dvd's into. The pack looks great but dvd's sitting cardbord covers, come on, geat real how did they think of such a dumb thing to do.5 stars for the movie and special featues2 stars for the packageing"	5.0	Some of Change's to the Director's cut of Pearl Harbor	2002-06-30	1	0	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A329ZCPZJN0SYB	Aaron Lawrence	I hated this film. Hated it! It was chock full of cheap, insencere sentimentality and unnecissary violence. None of the characters were remotely believable, and you would expect better performances from the actors for the copious amounts of money they received to appear in this piece of fluff. I felt no connection with any of the characters. In fact, this film failed miserably to get any sort of emotional reaction out of me besides boredom and annoyance. The revisionist history and unquestioning idolization of the military all to present in this film were just the last straw for me. It's garbage like this that makes me lose faith in the blockbuster system.	1.0	This is the Reason I Hate Blockbusters	2002-07-08	1	1	0

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A294DWRBQUOIK4	"Aaron Newlands ""Sithgod"""	If ever there was a movie with mixed components it is this one. There are some amazing things in this film and some downright stupid ones. I am sure this movie will be debated for some time. But here is what I disliked, thought was ok, liked.Disliked.Very little historical accuracy. Starting with the Eagle squadrons. America was Neutral [well sort of] during the Battle of Britain. If an American flew for the RAF he lost his U.S citizenship. It was not something they were encouraged to do. Ben's character signs up and is told his transfer is approved. It just isn't right.The love triangle. Done to death and love stories in war films just never seem to work for me. Not when it is rammed down your throat like this one. As well as it being cliche.They pick and chose from events and speed through them as fast as they can to keep up with the love story. The movie goes for three hours and they can't find the time to do real events?Film makers [Bey I think it was] who say. &quot; No one has ever done a movie like this.&quot; Well he is wrong in a big way and I have three words for him. Tora, Tora, Tora.Way to one sided. The patriotic messege is so strong and so one sided for the most part that it doesn't show the story from both sides. The Japanese parts are so quick that it doesn't make alot of sense.A weak and extended plot really attack this film and that is a shame.What was ok.The initial dating part of the love story I didn't mind. It had some sweet and funny moments. But it soon turned into the triangle and that was the end of reality there.What I liked.Dan Akroyd as the intelligence officer. A good portrayal for him and over all very underused in the film. Some likable characters. Some of the support characters are quite fun. The Japanese parts of the film are excellent although very disjointed. The pond with the floating models and the Japanese fleet in the background is an amazing shot. The letter home from a Japanese pilot to his father, hoping to bring honor to the family and to do his duty is an interesting touch.The Japanese flying into the island. This is one of my favourite parts of the film. The boys playing baseball as the planes fly by, the woman hanging clothes as the zero goes overhead. Absolutly amazing. The attack itself is brilliant. Val's in their dives, Zero's flashing between ships and the torpedo's in the water are just breathtaking.The digital sound. Crank it up for the aircraft scenes. The sound is incredible.But at the end of the day it is a mixed movie. A movie that is far better is Tora, Tora, Tora. It is alot older. But for its day the aerial scenes are amazing and they show the events from both sides. It shows all the major Japanese players and what led Japan to attack Pearl. It details why it had to be Pearl and all the planning and training the Japanese did. It is unbiased. It isn't pro America and it isn't pro Japan. It just shows what happened and why. It talks about the British attack at Taranto against the Italian fleet and how it and Pearl were shallow and normally torpedo's would not work. Overall Tora, Tora, Tora is an incredible film and if you are interested in the historical side of it without romance then give it a watch.So why did I buy Pearl Harbor? The aircraft scenes pure and simple. I love planes always have since I was a kid.  The aerial scenes and digital sound just drives me wild even though the film is no where near as good as it should have been. If you love aircraft as much as I do then the rewatch value will be there. If you want a historical movie without hollyood plots. Then give this one a miss and buy Tora, Tora, Tora	3.0	A difficult film to deal with.	2001-12-06	2	2	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1O005WUQUF1K9	Aaron Scott	"Dear God! but I'm glad I'd not seen this abomination earlier and wish I'd never seen it at all.  The title is ""Pearl Harbor""--which was a NAVY tragedy--but the plot focuses on the trifling issues of the (then) Army Air Force.  Had they titled it ""Dolittle's Raid"", it might more accurately reflect the wretched production.  My father, who was on the West Virginia that day (and was represented without name in the movie) must be spinning in his grave.  History it is not, nor anything like unto.  Entertaining--possibly to those of low or no standards of historical accuracy--but to pretend it reflects anything whatever about the tragedy at Pearl Harbor is a farce worthy only of Hollywood in its cups.  Had I the money I would buy up every copy, including originals, and destroy them as a tribute to my father and his NAVY friends who died that day and were passed over by this movie that Sucketh Mightily."	1.0	An Insult to any Seaman of WWII	2006-07-30	24	19	5
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3D9250MUWUPBV	Aaron Smith	"I didn't think this movie could be as bad as the critics made it sound, but after seeing it they were kind.  What a load!  Bruckheimer and Bay never made great films, but at least sometimes they've been entertaining.  Like Armageddon, this movie is neither.  What a shame, because their was a good enough cast and budget to make a last act tribute to the Greatest Generation.  As a bonus, Bay and Bruckheimer ran an uncontested 60th anniversary tribute film.We've all heard about the script, and it's all true.  It's both unintentionally funny and unconsciously ridiculous.  Give this team credit for not using irony as a safety valve.  Who else would dare put lines like ""There's nothing stronger than the heart of a volunteer"", or ""Do me a favor, pray for both of us"", or ""Don't worry, you've trained us well"" over foreboding mood music?  It's priceless.  If you watch Alec Baldwin closely for each of his stilted lines, he looks like he's having trouble keeping a straight face.  You'll have an even harder time.Then there's the love triangle where Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett (or Affleck, depending on the scene) stare at each other doe-eyed.  It's like From Here to Eternity without the chemistry.  It's consistent with the rest of the scenes in that no cliche is left unused.  It might be a waste of time to point out the gaffes if that's what they're supposed to be, like why would at least 10 kids get together at 7 am on a Friday morning to play baseball?  Didn't Hawaii have school in December?  And how did Red suddenly lose his stutter after the raid?  You'd think in a movie like this that other characters would at least mention it.The historical discrepencies are understandable, except for the scene where FDR rose to his feet.  Weren't the attack and the bomb raid important enough without bogus scenes thrown in?  That's part of the problem.  If you're gonna call a movie Pearl Harbor, spend 9 figures making it and premiere it in front of actual survivors at the scene of the crime, the story and drama of the attack are enough for a movie.  Save the Tokyo bomb raid for another movie and spend the time and money that you would have spent on some 3 dimensional characters, the attack itself and the aftermath.This isn't the worst war film ever made, but it won't be forgotten.  To all future schoolchildren who will inevitably have to sit through this movie during a social studies class, we all apologize in advance.  Unfortunately some current and future teachers will have a dubious grasp of history and even more dubious taste in film, so they will make you watch.  It is not necessarily because they want to punish you.  Now if they force you to watch it in detention...."	2.0	What else can you say about this movie?	2002-01-22	7	5	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2RQUPLNU3AGKC	Aaron Snyder	After watching the movie for ten minutes anyone over the age of ten will easily be able to guess the ending.  It's the most predictable film I have ever seen.  It's also very overdramatic.  You're hit with dramatic wannabe heart wrenching scene over and over, but since the director isn't able to get you interested in the characters or the story the moving images mean nothing to the viewer.  It trys to be a cross between Titanic (mostly) and Saving Private Ryan, and other movies, but it fails to approach the quality of either of those two movies.  The special fx and the battle scenes are nify.  It's too bad they couldn't have been used in a better movie.	1.0	Predictable and overblown	2001-05-31	3	3	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A157IR8ZWL43QV	Abaachaz864	Boy falls in love with girl.  Boy dies.  Boy's friend falls in love with girl.  Surprise! - boy not really dead.  Boy mad at friend for falling in love with girl.  Japan attacks America.  Boy reunites with friend so they can save the world.  The End.This whole movie reminded me of that classic B-movie line from 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' - &quot;The message couldn't get through because of the weather conditions in outer space!&quot;  Just a complete ignorance of the subject they're talking about.  But whereas 'Plan 9' can be funny and charming due to how bad it is, 'Pearl Harbor' thinks itself to be of a higher caliber and turns out being only insulting, vapid and very poorly written.I won't comment on the factual innacuracies and two dimensional portrayal of Japan, since many reviewers have done so already.  I don't know if there is a line between patriotism and ethnocentricity, but if there is, Pearl Harbor definately crosses it.  But we can't really blame the writers for being so painfully ignorant, since they never claimed to be making a documentary.  The problem with Pearl Harbor is that it's 30 minutes of the attack on Pearl Harbor surrounded by 2 and a half hours of soap opera.  Good writing is when even if one scene is removed, the whole story would be disrupted.  This movie could have easily been 90 minutes and still have gotten from point A to point B.  Everything is so predictable and cliche-ridden that not once did I forget I was watching actors moving around on sets.  Even the highlight of the movie, the attack, is far too long.  The writers seemed to realize that the story they had built around it was thin and plodding along so they figured that if they blow up as many things as possible, it would make up for it.  But, as Hemingway reminded us, &quot;Never mistake motion for action.&quot;But the most disgusting part of this movie is its recent marketing campaign that exploits our sudden surge in &quot;american pride&quot;.  The commercials lead you to believe that seeing this movie is just as &quot;patriotic&quot; as donating blood.  I can only imagine the joy of everyone involved with the project when the WTC was attacked and the media flocked in calling it &quot;the next Pearl Harbor&quot;.  Maybe our oh-so-wonderful nation will be blessed with a sequel on 9/11/2002.  We can only hope.	1.0	Remarkably bad	2001-12-06	10	5	5

Bouardi	When you're looking for who makes the movies people refer to as &quot;Studio Junk&quot;, they are talking about Bruckheimer and Bay as producers.  Pearl Harbor is nothing short of pure insult both to the Japanese and to the Americans who were actually involved.  While Beckinsale attempts to emote as much as her flat character can (As Ken Law said, she plays the typical Bruckheimer/Bay female character in which she just pines for her man), it's not enough to pull this swamp movie out of the dumps.  The script/dialogue/action were all bunk.  I realise the movie is not historically accurate, but the contrived formulaic junk they've tried to feed us is beyond belief.  We should start a petition to get our money back, quite frankly.  Admittedly, Affleck and the new guy aren't bad in the looks department.	1.0	Typical drivel.	2001-06-09	13	10	3
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3QUDM4IN77X2W	A. Brammer	All I have to say is:  why was Cuba Gooding, Jr in this movie?  He played no important role.  The director easily could have edited him out of the movie.  Now, I'm not putting down African-Americans, but what did he add to the story?  Nothing.  You never would have missed him.  If you wanted to do a movie set in Pearl Harbor about a cook, good for you.  If you want to do a movie set in Pearl Harbor about 2 pilots and a nurse, good for you, but none of them even interacted with Cuba Gooding, Jr.And that's another thing; the whole love triangle just disgusted me.  I think you have enough plot prepared with WWII going on, you really don't need the added tangle of a love triangle.  If you wanted to do the triangle, good for you, focus on that, use WWII as an excuse to why Rafe is gone.  If you wanted to do WWII, good for you, focus on that, and experience the war through Josh Hartnett's eyes, or through the friends' eyes.  You'll just make it too complicated if you do both.	3.0	What the?	2002-03-12	1	0	1

Burchfield	I've just watched it and while I don't think Pearl Harbor is nearly as bad as some reviewers do I do think the producers tried to put too much into it. For your time spent viewing it you get a long build up towards what could be called the title segment (for a movie named Pearl Harbor not much of it occured there)followed by what could almost be termed a chunk of another movie entirely (Dolittle's raid on Tokyo). I also thought that the romance angle seemed to almost be another story by itself. Pearl Harbor has some great battle sequences, maybe the best I've seen, and for romance, well, it has that too but I wish things had somehow been handled differently. Buy it for a good idea of what the attack itself might've been like but don't plan on finding it to be a really great movie.	3.0	Put together out of what could've been two or three movies	2002-01-28	6	2	4

I can't believe i wasted 3 hrs through this drivel. Sure the attack scene was amazing...but to wade through the first 90 mins of mush was unbearable.

I was actually chuckling at the dialog and some of those beauty scenes were just to much to handle.  As far as I am concerned Enemy at the Gates was a better war picture than Pearl Harbor. Don't expect a war movie out of this...and I suggest Military Historians stay away...wait for the video to come out, then jump to the attack sequence. I'm sorry to say...a grave dissapointment...now i'll have to wait for  Speilberg's/Tom Hanks &quot;Easy Company&quot; on HBO for the next great war film.	2.0	Don't waste 3 hrs of your life.	2001-05-29	6	4	2

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2913ON6VLLSRY	A Customer	I liked the movie overall, but I hated the cursing and the fornication. I'm not a script writer for movies or a writer at all, but I do know that the best books and movies have done without it. Frankly, I don't know why people keep watching movies with cursing, fornication, and a lot of other crude elements like that. I really don't see that it makes it any better at all, only worse. I know a lot of people disagree with me and/or don't like me at all for writing this, but I just have too, because I'm a Christian, which are suppossed to be salt(to preserve) and light(to shed light in the dark places and to show how ugly sin is). I don't mean to wag my tongue, I know I'm not perfect, no one is, except God and I know He doesn't have favorites, because the Bible says so. I know that movies with these types of features will keep being made and most people will keep watching them, but the importent thing is, that we do what God says. I have read the Bible and I believe it's the written Word of God, so what I'm getting at is, since God is omniscient(all-knowing) and omnipotent(all-powerful), I think I should listen to Him. It's only logical. Read Philippians 4:8 and Colosians 3:2 (God wrote this too, and He doesn't do anything in a vain) about what to think about.	3.0	Could Have Been A Better Movie	2002-04-20	5	2	3

[Both countries?] The Japanese plan a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor to cripple the Pacific fleet while they invade British and Dutch colonies. Admiral Kimmel is in charge of Pearl Harbor. We see RAF pilots scramble to meet the enemy bombers. One is shot down. We see a boxing match on one ship. [Another anachronism?] Naval Intelligence analyzes the Japanese messages; is it a trick? [Was Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" a flop?] What happened to those Japanese Navy ships? Would a woman travel unescorted in those days? Did woman wear two-piece swimsuits then? No tops for men? Naval Intelligence tries to locate the Japanese fleet. They listen in on a telephone conversation. Rafe returns! [Believable without a warning?] There is conflict between friends, then a bar fight. ""Send MP's!"" The Japanese prepare to attack at dawn. Decoded messages tell of imminent war.Airplanes attack the ships! ""Get up!"" The sailors react to the explosions and warnings. Ships explode from bombs. ""General quarters!"" Parked airplanes are sitting targets. Soldiers shoot their WW I rifles at attacking planes. Bombs fall. A ship capsizes with sailors clinging to the sides. The wounded get treatment. Two P-40s take off to fight the enemy. Others fire from the ground. We see CGI airplane combat. The wounded arrive at the hospital. The critical are admitted. One nurse is a casualty. The wounded are treated. ""Go with God."" They try to rescue the sailors trapped in sunken ships, forty feet below the waves.President Roosevelt asks for a Declaration of War from Congress. [This speech is phony, FDR did not give details about the damage.] FDR asks for an attack on Japan. Impossible? Colonel Doolittle is in charge of a ""Top Secret"" operation using Army B-25 bombers. These bombers are lightened for maximum range after launching from a short runway. They will bomb Tokyo, they are not untouchable. ""But that's just me."" ""Man your planes."" They take off on April 19, 1942 and fly low. ""Bombs away!"" [Direct radio communication to Washington was impossible then.] One plane lands after running out of fuel. They are captured by enemy soldiers after resisting in an emotional scene. Back in the States a transport plane unloads a coffin. The Doolittle raid was followed by victories. We see who survived the war and married.This seems to be a big budget production with a low budget director and screenwriter. Is there some hidden message in this story? ""From Here to Eternity"" was a better movie about that era. ""The Battle of Britain"" was the best movie on its subject. Removing the side story about air combat over Britain would have shortened this movie, it covered too much ground. The credits roll for a very long time. A history book will have a better story about Pearl Harbor."	2.0	Human Drama in Wartime	2012-12-18	3	3	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2WJXY1G4P4MWC	"Adam Adamou ""grazen"""	When my wife asked me to go see this film on Saturday night, I argued vehemently against it, citing the horrible reviews in particular, and the long playing time (3 hours). As it started, I was extremely cynical at nearly every scene.  As the movie played itself out however, I fell into it, and was moved by both the love triangle and the incredible cinematography. At the end, I had to admit to my wife that this was a GREAT film, not 5 stars, but 4 1/2 to be sure.  On the ride home, my wife reminded my about my disdain for the portentious film review clique and their bias towards films that the general public generally does not care for.  In short, don't listen to the reviewers, go see this film!	4.0	I LOVED IT DESPITE MYSELF!	2001-05-28	2	2	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A33L7G4E8CID3	"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19"""	Pearl Harbor is a movie that strives to be an epic. It is shot in an epic manner and it is near three hours in length. It is directed by Michael Bay, the man responsible for such films as The Rock and Armageddon (both of which Jerry Bruckheimer also produced. Some pedigree, huh? This movie just doesn't know what to do. It tries to be a romantic comedy, and fails. It tries to be a romantic drama, but that fails too. It portrays the Pearl bombing fairly disturbingly (30 mins in a 3+ hour movie. Why was this movie called Pearl Harbor anyhow. It neither starts nor ends there?), even so, the megabucks special effects can't compare to the more subdued but more affecting effects on the true Pearl epic, Tora! Tora! Tora! Sure, the expectations are impossible, but this movie was hyped to be greater than the second coming.I looked at some of the other reviews for this film and a majority of them were praise. One even called this a powerful movie. Manipulative maybe. Endearing? Not to me, this movie has one of the most predictable plots I have ever seen, some of the most hollow and unbelievable characters, and just a plain out lack of originality.Even if you liked the film, you cannot tell me that this film was filled with all kinds of twists and turns. Who actually believed Rafe would die one hour into the movie? Ben Affleck is a hot commodity. Why would they voluntarily deprive him of screen time? And who didn't see the romance between his friend and girlfriend? Come on. The romantic comedy aspect is the most preposterous. The gags are visible a mile away. Some giggles, but no serious laughs here.Archetypes and celebrity cameos pervade this concoction, and the results range from great to bad. Jon Voigt is the great performance, he literally becomes FDR. I didn't even know who it was until I read the paper. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a Navy Cook, and he has approximately 5 min of time on screen, but he is good in those minutes. It is kind of a flashback to his earlier performance in Men of Honor. Dan Aykroyd is nearly unrecognizable as a Naval Inteligence Analyst who thinks the Japanese will attack at Pearl. He is on for about a minute. These short cameos evoke memories of A Bridge too Far or The Longest Day, but both of those movies had good writing and fine acting from the leads. There's the next problem. Ben Affleck's best performance to date was as Will's friend Chucky in Good Will Hunting, in which he was funny and serious at the same time. Armageddon was a dud, I haven't seen Bounce but it looks like Paltrow and Affleck are a better couple than Breckinridge and Affleck. Which brings me to my next point. Although Kate Breckinridge is a very attractive woman and a fine actress, there is no chemistry between her and Affleck. Josh Hartnett, however, is hard to tell. On one hand, his performance is more convincing than Affleck's. On the other hand, we know less about him. He steals some scenes.The final gripe is that this movie borrows from old war movies, romance novels, etc., that it really has nothing to call its own. Every old cliche is dragged out. None is left out. Rafe is a hero who can do no wrong, Josh Hartnett is his pushover friend, Evelyn is the girl, and can't the love triangle just die already? You'd think that a plot device as old as film itself might eventually go away, but no.This film is emotionally affecting, and after you watch it some of the lines will be stuck in your head. But that is just because of slick filmmaking and the delivery of the lines. The dialogue is mediocre most of the time. Oh, and Alec Baldwin is good as the bomber colonel. Like many modern &quot;epics&quot;, namely The Postman, this movie is not only boring, but trite, boring, unintelligent, boring, long, and boring. If you are really interested in Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, pick up the Special Edition of Tora! Tora! Tora!, now on DVD. Leave this to rot in bargain bins once people realize there is no substance here.	2.0	The Most Overrated and Hollow Movie...Ever	2001-08-21	14	11	3
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A28KTFPS5W6EXZ	Adam	BLOWN AWAY!!!!..... are the words that best describe my reaction after watching this AWSOME movie! Even after watching it for the 2nd and 3rd times my reaction never changed.  Pearl Harbor delivers a four star cast, a great story line, a acurate and honerable depiction of the actual bombing, great special effects, a mind blowing soundtrack, and most important of all leaves you with a stronger admiration for our veterans and an overwhelming feeling of American pride! Some may criticize that the movie is too long. However, if you really think about it, developing a plot, characters, and doing JUSTICE to depicting the most devistating attack on America that in addition resulted in the U.S. entering into WWII all in your typical one and a half till two hour movies running time, that is a TALL ORDER if you ask me! I have also heard &quot;UHHHH,IT'S A LOVE STORY&quot;.  Well yes it does have a love story in it but it is NOT ABOUT A LOVE STORY! I feel sorry for those people who only see that, they did not get what they should have out of this movie.  The love story is actually a very important part of this movie because it makes the story personal. A, &quot;this could have been you&quot;, &quot;this could have been your girl&quot;, &quot;this could have been your friend&quot; kind of thing! It maked you realise the sacrifice men and women were willing to give up if they should die for this country. That sacrifice was EVERYTHING! Their friends, family, even their future with the woman(or man) of their dreams! The price was high,but they were willing to pay! I actually almost let many of the negative reviews change my mind about purchasing this DVD but I took the chance and have no regrets, just gratitude to the film makers, producers,cast, and the real life heros of this country living and deceased, our veterans! THANK YOU!!!	5.0	AMERICANS SHOULD BE PROUD OF THIS FILM!!!!	2001-12-17	11	3	8
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A159S42FRN14W2	Adam L.	"December 7th, 1941. A day our nation will never forget. A day that is brilliantly captured in this movie. As the credits rolled on the screen after the show, I sat in my seat, amazed at what I had just witnessed. Pearl Harbor is oen of those movies that doesn't come along that often. A drama that touches the heart of a historical event.The casting in this movie was superb. Ben Affleck plays his character almost as well as in ""Good Will Hunting"". Newcomers Josh Harnett and Kate Beckinsale turn in wonderful performances that hold the viewer throughout the entire picture. However, the entire picture is the only problem I had with this film. The overall length of the film was just too long, although the ending was nothing like I was expecting. I was pleased to see this type of ending on such a sobering film.This film should be expecting a few Oscar nominations, most likely in the way of Best Visual Effects. The only thing holding this movie back, in my mind, is the length. But then again, Titanic was over 3 hours long, and it won almost everything, so we'll see what happens.All in all, I thought this movie was fantastic. As someone in the entertainment field, I can appreciate the hard work and dedication it takes to make a movie as powerful as this one.December 7th, 1941 is a day that will live in infamy. It will be remembered not just in our minds and history books, but in this motion picture as well."	4.0	A Day That Will Live In Infamy........	2001-09-28	0	0	0

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1AXHNRDJEQ0B	Adi Adler	This epic movie tried to appeal to everyone bycombining a few genres. There's a big romantic triangle between very &auml;ttractive&quot;stars (to appeal to girls &amp; women), a lot of actions &amp; special effects (to appeal to the guys), and a lot of history, inaccurate as it might be (so the movie would seem more 'serious').But the point was completely missed. Many people had to sit through a lot of romantic comedy &amp; drama scenes to finally get to the action / history parts, while those contained very little romantic sentimentality. And the 3 parts are as bland, standard and boring as they could get.As for the cast: I've seen Josh Hartnett in much better parts than this. Ben Affleck's choice to get this part was obvious, since he was seeminglybtrying to build a reputation as an action figure. Both have a horribly fake southern accent. It's hard for me to understand why good actors such as Dan Ackroyd or Kate Beckinsale were participating in this hhorribly bland movie, but at least they added some class to it (and at least the world was finally exposed at such a large scale to the excellent Kate Bekinsale).The special effects were probably amazing to watch at a cinema, but are far less impressive on a normal TV screen.My reccomndation? If you're addicted to romantic fluff or action movies in whatever form they might take, rent this DVD before buying it.	2.0	Pearl Harbor	2004-01-11	6	4	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3ONKRWEZMJJUV	"Adrian Duran Sanchez ""Conductista"""	Dear Mr. Bruckheimer and Mr. Bay:After a long time avoiding seeing your movie because all of the bad talking and negative reviews about it, I finally got to see it. Over the years I heard everything, comments like: it is a piece of junk, it stinks, I went blind after leaving the Theatre, and a very long etc, most of them with a very harsh and obscene language, also I heard comments from an small group of people thinking quite the opposite. But now I can tell you that your movie is far WORST than I expected, but to be honest, I didn't expect nothing good from your names, actually every time I hear the words: From producer Jerry Bruckheimer, or From director Michael Bay (or both together, like in this case), I take it as a massive warning to avoid seeing that movie (the exception was with Black Hawk Down, and because Ridley Scott was directing and co-producing it). I mean, your cinematographic interest have always been (plain and simple), to make a lot of money, to hell with quality, it's all about big bucks. So why a movie about Pearl Harbor? Well, after the huge success of Titanic, I guess you did the math, and that is: Epic Tragedy + Love Story = $$$. Yeah, not very difficult to guess, and so your strategy was to look for the next Anniversary of some worldwide tragedy, and that was Pearl Harbor. Again, after many year of bad films like: Armageddon, The Rock, Days of Thunder, Bad Boys (Part I and II, and possibly Part III), Pirates of the Caribbean, King Arthur, and a very long etc of sh?, Pearl Harbor wasn't going to be the exception.And so Mr. Bruckheimer, you went with your actual number one puppet Director, the infamous Michael Bay, a man who has brought a lot of money into your pocket. Luckily for him, he thinks in the same stinking way that you do, surely you deserve each other. Yes, lets talk a little bit about Michael Bay's direction (Amazon.com wont let me put in accurate words, what I really think of you as a Director). Your directorial skills are close to none, bad frame composition, bad actor direction, a blown up pace, corny sensitivity, and a careless camera movement to induce in the spectator a Music Video feeling of frenzy, a mere masquerade to distract from your empty vision. But with Pearl Harbor you went even further, the stupid script was deliberated set into screen to plague the images with a sick and cheap nationalistic pride, enhancing it (you thought), with a love triangle that is as vulgar and predictable as George Bush's Iraq War campaign, SHAME ON YOU (Where are the weapons of mass destruction George?). But what makes this even funnier is that you and Mr. Bruckheimer actually believe that your movie portraits the real events that took place in Pearl Harbor with all the tragic sense and heroic mood, no one can't take this film seriously, cheesy, boring, and completely blown up by your gringo sense of pride, you are not Oliver Stone, and you will never be.Pearl Harbor lasts at least one unnecessary hour, of course the Japanese version was completely dismissed, here they are just the bad guys, this is how partial and irresponsible your judgment is. Just like every movie that Mr. Bruckheimer has produced in the 90's, Pearl Harbor has an inaccurate photography that makes everything look superficially perfect, the result is again laughable, sum to this the esthetic values of the production design, where the goal was to put everything in front of the camera in a picture perfect style (Kate Beckinsale's hair is always static), something that is particularly sad in the supposedly gruesome attack scenes. And then, the particularly calculated way in which the poor soldiers where depicted aside fallen flags and the corpses of their friends was a mayor breakthrough in cinematographic manipulation, yes one step closer to the bottom. I can't understand how Hans Zimmer accepted to score your picture, and I don't blame him for the poor result, I mean, a good score (mostly), response to a good film, but with this piece of commercial junk, there was no way to inspire the composer.About the cast, well, Ben Affleck as Captain Rafe McCawley wasn't a mayor disappointment, I expected a bad performance from him, and boy did he deliver, but from here on, he wont get any worst, your mediocre actor direction Mr. Bay is a fine example of what not to do. Josh Harnett as Captain Danny Walker is equally flat, and Kate Beckinsale as the nurse and central piece of the love triangle, really could use some acting lessons, again your directorial Skills Mr. Bay, did some wonders, the supporting cast doesn't even deserve to be mention.The visual effects are good, but at this point, who cares?The Vista Series Director's Cut DVD offers a lot of material to the customer, which in this case is even more valuable, the History Channel stuff will make your pocket (Dear Amazon reader), hurt a little less, but do your self a favor and buy Tora, Tora, Tora, Special Edition DVD, you'll later thank me for that. (Yes, the visual and audio transferring of Pearl Harbor is quite good).At the end, I got it, Pearl Harbor was a satire of the tragic event, but it was sell out mistakenly as an Epic picture, the thing is that as a comedy, it also sucks (Surely, one of the worst films ever made). So, I'll like to say good-bye to you Mr. Bruckheimer and Mr. Bay with some kind words involving the (F) word to both of you and your movie, but again, Amazon.com wont let me say this in a harsh and obscene language (as you deserve). Have a nice day.	1.0	National Lampoon's Un-Official.	2003-12-30	27	20	7
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A38U6ZZME7XOY6	A. Field	What to say about Pearl Harbor.  Knowing that the producer of Armageddon and Con Air was making the film siginificantly lowered my expectations but I didn't think he would screw up this bad.  The love story at the beginning, whether it is the actors or the writing, didn't interest me at all.  I was looking at my watch waiting for the inevitable battle to come.  I have to admit, the battle scenes were impressive and the effects were amazing but I didn't get a feeling like I was watching something that really happened.  Saving Private Ryan (The Best War Movie Ever Made)made me feel I was right there in the thick of it.  Pearl Harbor needed to have an R rating to show the viewers the true brutality of war and not trivialize it with the hotdogging of two pilots at the end of the battle.  The producer and the director were way out of their league for this movie.  If their motive was to make a glossy, unemotional hollywood war movie then they succeeded.  If their goal was to make a historically accurate, gritty and believable tribute to the soldiers who gave their lives then they failed.	2.0	The previews lied	2001-06-10	5	4	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AWKMRO7IPAIHE	Agent Sonica	I had mixed feelings about this one.  Pearl Harbor starts out as a likeable romantic comedy with the war in the backdrop.  Then the love triangle comes in.  I liked it at first, but it started to get really old, predictable, and boring.  The tone of the movie changes yet again when the Japanese planes attack the island.  The special effects were amazing.  Except for that, the war took a backseat to the stupid love triangle.  It wasn't really a war flick; it was a romance that just happens to take place during World War Two.	3.0	Comedy? Romance? War movie???	2001-06-22	1	1	0

The movie is so real that you are shocked to find out that this acutally took place in real life.  Story goes well; In nineteen-fourty one. Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Harttmen) are two rouge pilots that have been good friends since they were 12.  After Rafe meets Evelyn, the two fall in love, and things start to change.  being such a good pilot and all, Rafe is sent to London to do most of England's fighting against the Nazis.  After being shot down and thougt dead, Danny and Evelyn are shipped to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.  The two then fall in love, but then confortation is sorted when Rafe returns...alive.  After finding out about Danny's affair, things get a little rough.  Meanwhile, the Government is in argument with the Japanesee with peace talks.  Eventually, Japan plans a strike on Pearl Harbor.  The fight is on when Rafe, Danny and the gang is up against an unplanned attack on the island.&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; has be the best film of the year and one of the greatest films of all time.  Although very long for three hours (The attack alone is thirty-five mintues) while crammed in with Celebrity comeos (Alec Baldwin, Jon Vought, Tom Sizemore, Cuba Gooding Jr.) PH is pretty much the TITANIC of the year.  it's very Educational too.  a must see.	5.0	Best Movie of the Year	2001-05-29	5	2	3
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3KWZEDTNY2BPG	A. Levy	If you can let yourself be entertained, this movie is exciting and beautifully done. If you have a decent home theater, you will find the effects (both sound and picture) are superb. I particularly liked the fact that facts were assembled from living witnesses and woven into the story. That added lots of interesting detail. Ok, the romance part of the plot was sappy and somewhat shallow. It wasn't that bad and was carried easily by the action and effects.	4.0	Great entertainment even if a bit sappy	2001-12-20	16	10	6
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1U1V1JT09MAN7	ALEXANDER KENNETH KUHNS	"I really disliked this film.  Why?  For several reasons.In the first place, this movie contained some of the worst dialog I have ever heard uttered on screen.  I am in the military, and if I ever said anything remotely resembling a line from this movie, I'd be laughed at.  The dialog between Beckinsale, Hartnett and Affleck (the legs of the love triangle) is unbelievably sappy.  They speak like no one I've ever met, and I refuse to believe that people in 1941 spoke that much differently than we do today, so that excuse is invalid.  It's hard to believe that Randall Wallace, the screenwriter, also penned the script of ""Braveheart"".  ....Second, the makers of the film obviously felt that we are all incompetent ...who don't know a lick about the history of that period, and/or simply can't grasp the complexities of the time.  Examples, you ask?  Okay, how about the newspaper with the headline, ""Germany Advances All Fronts""?  .... ...how else to make it clear that Germany at in 1941 was sitting on top of much of the civilized world (except for America)?  ....According to this film, the only reason Japan decided to attack us was that we cut off their oil.  ....They never bothered to explain that we cut off Japan's oil and scrap metal supply as a last resort protest to a blatant pattern of Japanese military expansion in China and Indochina.  For those of you who aren't aware, this expansion included the slaughter of at least 300,000 Chinese civilians and POWs at Nanking in the '30s.  I realize that this would have been difficult to include in the film, but at the end, the filmmakers did show Japanese troops in China and never bothered to explain how or why they got there.  ....Lastly, and most importantly, it irks me to no end that Disney decided to modify this film for foreign audiences.  I mean, the American version already soft-pedals the truth about the causes of the attack.  Are they going to add footage to show the Japanese leaders as heros for planning the attack?  ...the Japanese, unlike the Germans, have never fully acknowledged their role in the war or many of the things that their troops did in it.  Japanese visit Pearl Harbor all the time and many say they've never been told about the attack.In effect, Disney is altering the truth of a critical historical event for the sake of profit.  American filmgoers, and more importantly, veterans of Pearl Harbor deserve much better.This film gets its two stars (only one given by me) because the battle scenes looked technically proficient."	2.0	....	2001-06-27	5	4	1

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1A87TUBBDPMF0	"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer"""	"Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has made some very good films in his career, including the powerful Black Hawk Down (which featured Josh Hartnett), and he may have intended 2001's Pearl Harbor to be among his best films. After all, Bruckheimer-produced films seem to be action- and explosion-packed dramas and/or adventure films. Of course, he had such directorial talents as Ridley and Tony Scott to helm such projects as Top Gun and Black Hawk Down, but Michael Bay is not in those brothers' league as a director, and Pearl Harbor fails as both a Titanic-wannabe and a 61st Anniversary tribute to the heroes -- living or dead -- of Dec. 7, 1941.Not only does Braveheart screenwriter Randall Wallace (We Were Soldiers) attempt to use every hoary war movie-mixed-with-love story cliche imaginable, inluding the Two Inseparable Childhood Pals Who Fall For the Same Woman plot that pits Ben Affleck and Hartnett in a romantic tug-of-war over Kate Beckinsale, but he also limits the actual centerpiece of the movie -- the attack on Pearl Harbor on that ""day of infamy"" -- to 40 minutes....and goes on to depict the April 18, 1942 Doolitle Raid on Tokyo and other Japanese cities, with Affleck and Hartnett at the controls of a B-25 medium bomber.I have no quarrel with the idea of framing a standard romance between fictional characters with true historical events.  Indeed, James Cameron did a good job with 1997's Titanic, and From Here to Eternity is a fine film set on Oahu during the months leading up to Dec. 7, 1941.  And had Bruckheimer, Wallace and Bay even attempted to strive for some modicum of historical accuracy while still focusing on the Affleck-Beckinsale-Hartnett triangle, maybe their movie would not have been as bad as it is.For instance, the scenes showing Admiral Yamamoto (Mako) and his staff planning their attack look ridiculously as if filmed on a minimalist Kabuki stage.  The staff offices and ships' wardrooms where Genda, Fuchida, Watanabe, and Nagumo discussed ""Operation Hawaii"" are nowhere to be seen in this movie. Instead, the Japanese are often depicted in outdoorsy little parks with Rising Sun banners.While Affleck and Hartnett's characters are established as first rate pilots, they have been trained to fly single engine fighters.  But when the USS Hornet launches the 16 B-25 medium bombers on their daring ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo"" raid, our two flyboy friends are at the controls of one of these twin-engine planes. Hmmm....Maybe they took a Berlitz Bomber Flying Course in Five Easy Lessons?Most of the historical characters here are played by talented actors (Jon Voight, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Colm Feore) but their parts are basically glorified cameos.  The only historical figure who has more than two lines is James Doolitle, played here by Alec Baldwin, who has no charisma whatsoever left over from his early successes in Beetlejuice and The Hunt for Red October.The attack on Pearl Harbor is also problematic.  Bay has his Industrial Light and Magic CGI Japanese planes attacking the ships almost at random, with torpedo bombers striking the battleships well into the raid. Messrs. Wallace and Bay should go back to college and read Walter Lord's Day of Infamy or Gordon Prange's Dec. 7, 1941, where the authors explain that the torpedo planes were the first to strike. Had they come in willy nilly as in this movie, the smoke from the already bombed ships and airfields would have made their runs nearly impossible.And, although the battleships recreated here look like their 1941 counterparts, why do those destroyers look suspiciously like 1990s vintage Arleigh Burke class tin cans? Because, by golly, that's what they are!  (One of those guided missile destroyers could have shot down most of the first wave of attackers by itself!)Worse still, Pearl Harbor attempts to wring tears from its audience by showing dead nurses after the raid.  Yes, it's a powerful little fiction, but that's what it is, fiction.  Dishonest fiction, at that. It was bad enough to have lost 2,403 Americans on that terrible Sunday morning; couldn't the filmmakers avoid the temptation to tweak reality further and not add myths to the Pearl Harbor story? No, not in this sorry movie."	1.0	"Pearl Harbor's reach for ""epic"" status sinks...it stinks!"	2004-01-09	37	28	9

I ask you all to take a look back at ""Titanic"" and compare the reality of the two stories. At least ""Pearl Harbor's"" could have happend. The ""Titanic"" story of a first class woman falling in love with a third class man in 1912 is [not very believable]. ""Pearl Harbor's"" story is a little shaky, but you have to have something filling in the spaces until the attack. And the attack is spectacular. The bombs hit, men fly through the air, and all hell breaks loose.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2Q9Q3C3BMORTN	Alison	I drove from a small town in B.C. where this movie would not be shown for at least two months to a larger city three hours away to see it.  I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for the last couple of weeks, and I wasn't disappointed.  The battle scenes were incredible, and the air battles were breathtaking for me.  I wanted so badly to be in the airplane with whomever was flying it.  As for the love triangle that we all hear so much about, it was enough to make me wish that I was in love with someone.  I left the theatre and drove home feeling lonely.  The scenes with Cuba Gooding Jr., which I read so much about weren't clear enough to me, and while he is an amazing actor, I didn't feel that the character he was playing was explained or focused on nearly enough.  About an hour through the film, I realized that a triangle can't always remain a triangle, and this saddened me.  I left the movie feeling somewhat melancholy, as though no ending could be a happy ending.  All in all, this movie, and the real men and women who lived through (and didn't) pearl harbor will remain in my mind for some time.  I also imagine if they hadn't had to have a PG13 rating, the film could have expanded further.  I didn't know very much about Pearl Harbor when I went into this film, but if the visual effects were accurate then I understand much better how easy my life is in comparison to sixty years ago.  I also hope that it never happens again.	4.0	a woman's point of view	2001-05-26	1	1	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2V40R97RU5NAB	Allan W. Goodall	The character development is non-existant. The acting was okay to wooden. The dialogue is awful. &quot;First you went away, then we thought you were dead, then all of this happened [referring to the attack on Pearl Harbor]...&quot;The story is inane. You can tell exactly what turns the plot is going to take at any time. You can probably guess almost all of the main plot points from the very beginning. It's a throw back to the old Saturday afternoon war movies, where one guy fights the war all on his own. Ben Affleck joins the British Eagle squadron (made up of Americans who went in as civilians and formally joined the RAF, but still manages to stay in the US Army); he is shot down, and taken to occupied France; somehow gets back to England, over to America, and out to Pearl Harbor before any word of being alive makes it there; he arrives the day before the raid; he is one of two pilots in his old squadron to take off during the raid; he and his best friend shoot down 7 Japanese aircraft; and then he gets recruited to fly B25s for Jimmy Doolittle.The first 90 minutes is a romance. Guy goes to war, is missing in action, best friend takes care of the girl when they think he's dead... well, you can guess where THIS is going.The combat footage isn't bad, except for the comic book dogfights, but the Pearl Harbor raid takes up only 35 minutes of the movie. Wrapping it up with the Doolittle raid would have been an intelligent choice if they didn't have the fighter pilots act as the crew of a couple of the bombers. If I was a B25 bomber vet, I'd have been insulted.One day someone will trim this turkey down to its battle scenes and post it on the web. Wait for that to happen. It's certainly not worth sitting through the full 3 hours to see good CGI used badly.	1.0	Worst Film of the Year	2001-09-20	7	6	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1ZBASWCOPAAC2	Almostunbiased	If you want action this movie has some serious action.  Will you have to fast forward a bunch to get to it?  Yes.  Is it worth it?  Yes, great action.If you want a great and unique love story this movie has it.  Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett play best buddy airmen who vie for the same women's (Kate Beckinsale) affection.  Without giving too much away through a strange twist of fate they both end up with the girl at different times and it seems like everything is falling apart when the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor.  From then on out the movie takes a quick detour from Romance to Action and does so abruptly and amazingly.  This movie makes you feel like you are there at one of the most horrific days of American history.  The buddies of course must work together to save their friends and in doing so reach an understanding with one another before they both have to leave the girl they love to attack Japan with none other than General James Doolittle.In the end this becomes a very touching thought out story that I enjoyed tremendously.  There are a few side stories that seem forced, but overall the cast is fun and the story is excellent.  The Blu-ray is excellent for both sound and picture.	5.0	Special effects extravaganza with a great love story to boot.	2009-06-20	4	0	4

For those who are interested in Pearl Harbor, and are looking for a more accurate portrayal, get Tora Tora Tora.

This movie shows the time that we were before and how we were after.  How we believed that we were invanceble to foreign invasion.  They put alot of time and money into doing this movie and trying to put into action what no one can put to words.  No one ever has or ever will be able to do a better job than they did on this movie.  The casting was great and the directors know what they wanted out of this movie.  The love story at the beginning puts a twist in the movie but it shows how friendship will overcome and loyalty was there no matter what the circumstance.  Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale were great together.  They made you believe that you were back in 1941 in another time when we could fall in love with someone in just a matter of days.  Cuba Gooding Jr. shows how he was looked at before the bombing by other men and how he was after the bombing.  NOt many men would pick up a gun and shot it if they didn't know what they were doing and he was the charecter of a GREAT man.  When it was at the piont of December 7, 1941 you could see on the acters faces the disbelieve of them being bombed and the fear in there eyes of dying.  The look of many kids ,that were not any older than I am, that were suppose to pick up a gun and fire at airplanes that were dropping bombs.  They showed you how they fought around the clock to try and get the men that were trapped on the boats drowning.  They showed you how they were trying to get out and how they got there hands threw little holes trying to push there way out so they could get to air but never did. Then at the end they give us the Dolittle raid on Tokyo.  We all know how the war turned out but we needed a little something to go home with.  Those men were brave.  They knew that they were going to be going on a suicide mission and how they got there mission acomplished knowing that they might not make it back.  They also give you a look at the Japanees way of thinking.  That they had to get us when we did not know that they were coming.  We would have crushed them they believed much faster if we had are ships.  We will never know about that but we will always remember December 7, 1941.	5.0	Pearl Harbor	2001-08-04	3	0	3

Most scenes looked like it was borrowed from somewhere else, like a messy patchwork of all the past movies (especially Titanic and Saving Private Ryan).The heroine is very beautiful, but the way she conveniently transfers her love from one man to another in a matter of months stirs no sympathy.Also, the movie is strangely full of Caucasian casts while hundreds of native Hawaiians and Japanese-Americans also fell victim to the attack.  The existence of Cuba Gooding Jr. was almost like an after-thought with no effect to the plot and no memorable dialogue.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A15TO349EAEMNJ	Amazon Customer	Despite other reviews you may have read, I'm here to tell you that &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is NOT one of the worst movies of the year. It's unfathomable to even say it! Yes the movie's long, but does that make it bad? No way. Ben Affleck is in it...does that make it bad? No way. Unfortunantely those two reasons seem to be the ONLY reasons it's getting worst pic reviews. People keep compairing it to &quot;Titanic&quot; and I think that has a lot to do with it's bad reviews. Well, I'm going to tell you why I think it's one of the best and not the bomb most people are perceiving it to be.After reading and hearing countless bad reviews of the movie, I decided to go and rent the movie and see for myself if it was really as bad as everyone was saying. I found the acting superb and the visual effects stunning. The bombing was so vivid that I thought I was right there in the middle of it. It doesn't look at all fake and it's hard to tell whether the scenes were shot on a lot or in the actual Pearl Harbor itself. And the casting was right on the money. Aside from the lead actors, you've got a supporting cast that consists of Jon Voight (in a dead-on FDR impression), Cuba Gooding Jr., Jennifer Garner and Alec Baldwin, amoung others.I also enjoyed the love story between the characters portrayed by Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett. It's so sad to see the emotions Kate's character, Lt. Evelyn Johnson, runs through when she thinks boyfriend, Captain Rafe McCawley (Affleck), has died. It's also very interesting to see the effects his return has on her budding relationship with best friend, Captain Danny Walker (Hartnett). The ending will surprise you, I promise. It's very touching and had me crying for about 10 minutes after the movie ended. The lifelong friendship between Rafe and Danny is so special and only adds to the movie's appeal.Aside from the movie, the special features the 2-set DVD offers is amazing. You get the following: &quot;Journey To The Screen: The Making of Pearl Harbor&quot;, The History Channel's Documentary &quot;Unsung Heros&quot; (which in itself is worth the price of the DVD), and Faith Hill's soaring theme song/video &quot;There You'll Be&quot;. After watching the documentary and the &quot;Making Of..&quot;, I promise that you'll have a greater respect for the movie and more importantly the people who actually lived through the Pearl Harbor events. It's very moving to relive that day with survivors and to hear the stories of those who died.In short, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is a great movie. So before you dismiss this movie, go rent it and decide for yourself like I did. I think you'll find that it's not one of the worst movies of the year, but one of the best.God Bless America!

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1OBU0FTRIJQ3F	Amazon Customer	All I could think of when I saw 'Pearl Harbor' is how very much like 'Titanic' it was. The plot is very different, the actors have a very unique style, but it seemed like Michael Bay was trying to recreate James Cameron's success - a bold ambition. By using the same thematic elements - love won and lost, man-made disasters, and surrealistic settings, I am thinking he hoped it would gain the same epic-movie status as others like it. I'm not surprised it failed to get as much box office attention as 'Titanic', simply because the notice surrounding that film was so unbelievable. However, that doesn't mean that this film wasn't successful. It really is quite good.Yeah, okay, sometimes the dialogue is quite hokey.. what's with Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett's awkwardness around each other - even after being close for so long - and with that constant rehearsing what they are about to say to each other? It was cute when it was first done, but after that, it just got rather old. The romance between Ben Affleck and Beckinsale was also rather contrived, kinda set up, but if you can push that into the back of your mind it's sweet and cute. You really don't get a glimpse of the seriousness of their relationship until they explain it.The action sequences were very long and very drawn out, but managed to be relatively interesting. It was actually quite shocking for a while, until it was clear it wasn't going to end anytime soon. The way the nurses are portrayed is really fabulous, the confusion, the death, is all played out beautifully. The soundtrack is OK.. Faith Hill's love theme song is very irritating, altough on a particularly emotional day I heard it on the radio and began to sob. Hans Zimmer has done better work ('Gladiator', etc). The ending of this movie, with the dialogue being as cheesy as it was, could have been a whole lot more tear-jerking. But as it was, I was crying in the theater anyway! Heck, Ben Affeck and Josh Hartnett have been able to inspire tears in all their films - 'Armageddon', 'Here on Earth', all that. I must say that Kate Beckinsale doesn't really do it for me, even though she is a beautiful and talented actress. I think they needed someone a little less glamorous and a little more down-to-earth to play her, but she's still good. Her narrating at the end is quite nasty, however, really a bad way to end the film.All in all, not as good as I hoped, but really not too bad.

This Film had so much potential but in my humble opinion failed to deliver, effects were outstanding location and visuals really good, the rest i found really hard to bare, tacky lines in the film which made me cringe and some scenes made this film more like a goverment recruitment film, the love story was tacky, not very believable thus predictable. I think Kelly's Heroes or Tora,Tora,Tora, Battle of the bulge would be better viewing and they were made a while back and stand up better.	2.0	Could have been good.......but	2004-10-20	4	2	2

I could probably write an extremely long, scathing review of the film, but I'll keep the problems succinct (with many spoilers, I might add).First, the previews for the film show Affleck fighting during the attack; unfortunately, the ""shock"" of his surviving the plane crash in Europe (and ultimately the entire emotional impact of him finding out about the new Hawaii love) was negated by this.Secondly, director Michael Bay had to produce a PG-13 rating to make all the money back that he spent on making the film, so unfortunately the horror and carnage of war and death has been relegated to the side-lines in favor of eye-popping yet repeticious special effects (wasn't that ship blown up three times already?).  As a sad result, war has never seemed so cool.Thirdly, concerning history: The script proposes that Roosevelt used his disability to make a point during a crucial discussion in Washington; in actuality, he went to great lengths not only to hide this fact from America but never turned it into an issue or point-making gesture.  And don't even get me started on the film's portrayal of the Japanese!Fourthly, instead of taking the remaining hour following the attack to wrap up the contrived love-triangle (which truly attempts to be the central story line), the filmmakers opt for a pointless retelling of Doolittle's air-raid on Japan to raise the viewers' spirits about America's retaliating force.  No offense, but we know we won the war--we don't need the end of the film to try and explain this to us.Fifthly, if the film had even one more American flag floating in the water of the harbor, I thought that I was going to end up hurting someone.  Please, Michael, keep your perpetual hard-on for nostalgia and Americana to a minimum.And last--but certainly not least--the film uses the oldest trick in the book to solve the love-triangle.  And for those of you who think this trick is resolution, talking issues out, and realizing how all parties involved made mistakes, think again.  For the sake of those who haven't seen it yet, I'll not ruin the awful and contrived ending for you.These are only a few unfortunate occurences that happen during ""Pearl Harbor.""  Perhaps Bay should realize that he's much more adept at making mindless action films for pure enjoyment, and he should leave the heavier stuff to the professionals who really know what they're doing."	1.0	Long, over-indulgent, shallow, inaccurate...need I go on?	2002-02-11	6	5	1

It deserves far more than a big-screen soap opera that is an insult to the memory of those who died at Pearl Harbor.Add to that the fact that the producers, in order to pocket the largest profits possible, made a ""Japanese-friendly"" version for release in Japan and you have one of the most irresponsible movies ever made.

The plot and the subplot work well together to make this a super movie.  You get involved with the different characters.  That is one ingrediant that makes a movie good.  The camera work and special effects are also done very well.  Pearl Harbor is the best movie I've seen in a while.  It also gives the viewer a lesson in the history surrounding this event in our nation and makes you really feel for the man and women who went through this terrible ordeal.

It can be likened to &quot;Titanic&quot; due to the love story set against the backdrop of the events in 1941. The love triangle is quite a complex and interesting one - but unique and involved enough to bring a lump to your throat. The action sequences are brilliant. Ben and Josh shine. In the end this is a movie that delivers everything it promised and should not be faulted for it's grand style nor should the fact that it really is a &quot;Hollywood&quot; summer epic be considered a criticism - on the contrary it is the best such film in a long time.	5.0	Not a war movie, but entertaining!	2001-05-26	1	0	1

The first half of the movie is about a great love triangle, and it is much better then Titanic's very unrealistic love story.  My grandmother was a nurse in Hawaii when Pearl was bombed by the Japanese.  The 4th time I went to see the movie, she came with me.  She said that the nurses in the movie were realistically portrayed of the nurses in the 1940's.  This is a great movie and it didn't deserve such bad reviews.

Make up your own mind about that.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3ADV42EWEI92	A. Mills	The basic theme of the story centers around the love triangle involving the characters played by Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett.  The first hour of the film drags on at times in the building of this triangle.  The film then ventures into the events leading to the bombing itself as well as the events after the bombing.  The special effects were believable and well timed.  The end of the DVD and VHS version offer a documentary through the History Channel with interesting explainations and facts surrounding the bombing.  The cast of characters also include supporting roles by known actors such as Cuba Gooding Jr., John Voight, Alec Baldwin, Dan Akroyd, Andrew Bryniarski, and Guy Torry to name a few.  With the movie containing a mix of history centered around a romantic theme, overall, it was an enjoyable film.	4.0	Pearl Harbor	2001-12-31	0	0	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2OPEFQ5R5ZDXO	Amy Crumbaugh	I've been waiting to see this movie forever, what with the big deal trailors and all, and I'm saying now that it was well worth the wait. Of course, critics are going to find something to slam about it, but the people's opinions really matter. It may not be historically accurate down to every last stitch, but people have to remind themselves that this is Hollywood and that it's meant more to entertain then to educate. They're not making a documentary, they're making a movie. Some people, though, may be dissapointed by how much of a love story it is (I wasn't, though, considering I'm a chick), but the extremely realistic action sequences make up for it. It's like the film makers were actually there the day it happened, and that it should give you a new found respect for all of that suffering that happened in only about two hours. Bottom Line : The love story is old fashion romance, the bombing is breathtaking, and the movie is all together made very well. The critics need to shutup. Go see it in theatres to get the WHOLE experience.	4.0	Worth The Wait	2001-06-03	1	0	1

They added a battle scene or two, and voila! &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; was born. I got to see this movie first as extra credit for a humanities class; the teacher shouldn't have bothered, because &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; had very little to do with actual history. Most of the movie was bogged down in a sappy, overused love triangle, not to mention the improbability of a downed pilot coming back from the dead. Then, at the end, the Doolittle raid convieniently removed one of the men from the scene. Strange how perfectly things worked out for the other guy... Cliched lines and a syrupy plot make this one to avoid for all but diehard fans of the bushy-eyebrowed Hartnett and cleft-chinned Affleck.	2.0	I'm not a chick flick fan... not after &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;...	2002-01-03	1	1	0

I had to go see it because my in-laws were in town for Memorial Day and they were convinced it would be good. WRONG!  The love story was infuriating. The dialog was so bad that I rolled my eyes so much they hurt by the middle of the movie, which by the way is entirely to long. Could Kate B. be wearing any more lipstick? Alec Baldwin should stick to not acting.  The only interesting part of this movie was the detailed shots of the different fighter planes.  At least they couldn't screw that up.

Hell, I've heard some of the survivors of the true event trash this movie.You don't need to make up a sappy love story to talk about Pearl Harbor. There was more than enough drama in the real event.To any history teachers that may be thinking of showing this to their class....please don't!  This is NOT history.

I would have to say that this movie is a great deal better than Titanic.After the lights came on, I looked around the sold-out theatre and saw a lot of the audience still showing signs of tears.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	Known for making very BIG films, Michael Bay isn't the first person you'd think of to direct an intimate film about the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  Isn't that concept more appropriate for someone like Steven Spielberg?  And then, when watching `Pearl Harbor' you instantly understand that it is a Michael Bay film and you can see why the logic in him staying away from the project would have been good to heed.  `Pearl Harbor' has very big and very loud moments, and those moments usually go off without a hitch (for to say that Bay doesn't understand action would be a lie), but it is within the more intimate corners of the film that it completely falls apart.  I will not entirely knock Michael Bay, for I am one of the few cinephiles who actually thinks `Armageddon' was one of the best films of 1998 and would actually place it higher than the Oscar winning `Saving Private Ryan', which got almost everything outside of the direction WRONG.  That said, I cannot muster enough appreciation to negate the fact that `Pearl Harbor' fails miserably in doing what it attempts to do.  Maybe it's because none of the actors (who have all proven themselves capable before) turn in stale performances that draw no emotions from the audience, and maybe it's because `Pearl Harbor' loads on the familiar clich&eacute;s thicker than `Forrest Gump' did, and without the same amount of finessed execution.  Maybe it's because the film doesn't maintain focus and so it becomes wildly uneven in tone.  Maybe it's because all integrity of the situation is lost in a shameless attempt to create a Soap Opera.  Whatever it is, when all is said and done, `Pearl Harbor' is a forgettable spectacle; a film that throws a lot at you but fails to make anything stick.	2.0	Movie go boom...	2011-04-29	4	3	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A64A21O9IQMAJ	Andrew Grein	I thought this movie was very entertaining and worth the price of the movie.  I had heard all of the negative press and read quite a bit of the reviews this movie earned, so I was prepared for the worse.However, I found the movie to be incredibly engaging, highly entertaining and visually stunning.  It was not made to be a docudrama about the attack on Pearl Harbor.  It is a summer movie that uses Pearl Harbor and the attack by the Japanese as a back drop to tell a story.  Granted, the story has been told before (many times), but it is still entertaining.  And the visual effects the producers used in this movie certainly raise the bar for other action movies (war or not) to attempt to meet.The actors did a good job, although I don't think there are any more cliches they could have written into the dialogue of Alec Baldwin's character.The additional material included on the DVD add to the experience of the movie, and allow the viewers to appreciate both the art of making a movie like this and the experience of the people this movie tries to portray.  I was disappointed that the 183 minute movie was split up on the two DVDs though, and not put all on one of the discs.I really think that all of the people that have jumped on the &quot;attack Pearl Harbor&quot; band wagon should take a breath, step back, and look at the movie for what it is.  If they do that, they might be able to enjoy going to the movies much more.  I would recommend Pearl Harbor.  If you liked movies like Independence Day, Armageddon, Twister and Saving Private Ryan, you'll like this also.	3.0	A Worthy Summer Drama	2002-01-27	0	0	0

While I don't have anything against attractive men and women, it's just so obvious that that's the reason why they were chosen for those roles. The real heroes in Pearl Harbor didn't come from Entertainment Magazine. They were made of common clay. Some maybe attractive, some maybe not so attractive.Not history so much as propoganda:They make it seem like before Pearl Harbor America was the only reason Britain was still standing on two feet. Sort of like America was fighting the war before it started fighting the war. Now I'm an American and am proud of our nation's accomplishments, but I'm not proud of the distorted image of history that this movie falsely suggests. There were indeed some American pilots who volunteered to help Britain before Pearl Harbor. But these were few and far between. Like every other nation, America was in it to advance its own interests. And that involved squeezing Britain by trading British bases in the Caribean in return for giving them some, yes, crucial war supplies.Nothing original (let me amend that: nothing original that is good).We've seen this type of love story in the movies so many times and it has been done oh so much better. Even though they're attractive, it's ironic that the bad chemistry makes it just painful to watch.Off the top of my head, I can think of one movie that I dislike about as much as this one: Armageddon. But at least Armageddon knew that it wasn't portraying reality and didn't expect its audience to think it reflected reality.Simply dreadful."	1.0	If the WHOLE movie was just a black screen with no sound, it would have been a better movie	2007-08-09	5	2	3

The script also contains some of the worst 'romantic' dialog since ""Attack of the Clones."" Honestly, Ben-Lo should attempt another career path...seriously.

I had heard that there was a TITANIC-like love story where half of it would be a long boring love story and then a twenty minute action sequence.  This was not the case at all.  There was a love story in the film but it acually worked verry well.  The action sequences just blew me away.  There were incredible dogfighting scenes and the actual attack is breath taking.  The flm is fairly long--at 3 hours but you cannot even tell.  It goes by very quick.

To me that's what sells a movie, because it will drawl all types of audiences.Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, And Josh Hartnett put in a great performance, and it's not all romance.  I'd say a good two hours of the movie is action, but then the other hour is making the storyline.  It was worth it to see on a big screen.True, it was not completely sticking to history, but if you want the facts on Pearl Harbor go rent Tora! Tora! Tora!.  I don't know why everyone thinks if they go to see a movie it should be completely true, because that's not how movies get an audience.If you want an all around good movie that will make you laugh and cry, pay the money to go see it.	5.0	Awesome	2001-06-19	7	2	5

The screenplay is good, the cinematography is amazing, the soundtrack is wonderful, and the acting is brilliant, and they effects are spectacular. I think the critics should lighten up, because it's better than what they are saying.Maybe I am just a teeny-bopper kid who will buy anything, But I have high standards and Pearl Harbor met them.

Now for the love triangle, i honestly was on dannys side because hes cuter and more lovable, but ofcourse he hadddddd to die, rafe couldnt die, cuz in the movie he died and came back, by died, i meen everyone thought he had died. I liked the romantic part of the movie better, cuz there was no blood and gore. The most romantic parts of the movie were when evelyn and danny were together, and the saddest when the attack was happening, and when evelyn and danny were apart, and ofcourse the end.this movie has something for everyone, trust me, watch it and youll want to watch again.	5.0	The best movie ever, and the best dvd	2001-12-06	11	1	10

'This is a Theatrical movie not a documentary' and anyone intending to catch this film at the flix should bare this in mind.Although carrying slightly too much romantic baggage, Pearl Harbour contains all the right ingreidients to cook up a fantastic action fuelled war drama, containing some of the best SFX and CGi I seen to date.The main cast by far delivered an entertaining performance heavily backed up by a strong supporting cast.  Ben Affleck certainly has picked up a few skills since the day's of Mall Rats, and doesn't he know it!  :)So as long as you're prepared to sit through some superb cheesecore, Pearl Harbour will have you leaving that overpriced popcorn in the seat next to you, left empty by the critic enslaved bod that went to see 'Mummy Returns'.	4.0	Pearl Harbour, it's only a film...	2001-06-13	4	0	4

Bertorelli	"I would venture to say that most people were expecting ""Pearl Harbor"" to be an action-packed, full-fledged war film similar to Patton.  ""Pearl Harbor"" clearly wasn't a film about war.  Yes, it did have plenty of action-packed war chorography, but after all, we are talking about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor here.  But it is not a film about war.  It's a film about people.In order for any story to be told properly, we need to be familiar with the characters.  In this film, in particular, the characters need to be more than just people in a story.  You need to feel the pain the characters are going through.  Seeing a pile of corpses carries more of an emotional weight if the audience has a chance to become familar with them.  Far too many times in war films, we see corpses as faceless individuals.  Well, they're not faceless to our *real* unsung heros.Pearl Harbor *is* an excellent film.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1534MBU6VJXYN	"Anthony Nasti ""Tony"""	"As a film showing a significant event in American history and how it affected many peoples' lives forever, ""Pearl Harbor"" is without a one star movie. But as an overblown but entertaining piece of eye candy filled with dazzling scenery and impressive special effects that only Michael Bay can provide, ""Pearl Harbor"" is a five star movie. These two points taken into account, ""Pearl Harbor"" is about a 3 1/2 star movie.Like most of Bay's films, (""Bad Boys"", ""Armageddon"") ""Pearl Harbor"" is a pointless film with lots of action and well known stars to keep you interested (the only one of Bay's film that had a real plot was ""The Rock""), as it's loaded with ear-shattering special effects and well known faces like Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, Kate Beckinsale, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Jon Voigt (whose performance as FDR ranks as possibly the worst portrayal of a president ever to be commited to film), Colm Feore, Jennifer Garner and Alec Baldwin. As sung in the recent ""Team America: World Police"", ""Pearl Harbor"" misses the point it's trying to bring across, and works as eye candy and nothing else. The story's main focus is on two soldiers (Affleck, Hartnett) either fighting for the love of a pretty nurse (Beckinsale) or playing with their 25 foot toys. Hartnett is about as appealing as wet paint, and while Affleck gets to do some good physical humor during an exam, he otherwise gives another going - through - the - motions performance. The only actors who put in decent performances are Baldwin and Gooding (who as sung in ""Team America"" really did need a bigger part).This film is a good film visually, but otherwise is an unsufferably tedious and rediculous movie that has no redeeming qualities aside from some good acting. Definitely a rental - only movie."	3.0	Grossly Inaccurate Eye Candy	2005-07-19	8	6	2

The movies makes a couple of farm boys look like Demi-Gods against Japanese pilots who have been in combat for almost a decade.  Not only that, Afflect never did tell his Beckinsdale how he survived after being shot down in France all those months.  He says he'll tell her later but he never does.  One of the many loose ends that is conveniently forgotten.  There doesn't seem to be a overall moral like all war movies before except Americans are great and big explosions.Love story may have worked if they didn't throw the third wheel in but alas what could have been.  Tora, Tora, Tora is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY better than this movie and that was made in 1970.  If only Tora, Tora, Tora was made with the kind of budget and special effects nowadays.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2ZOOLXILNKSLA	Antonio	Pearl Harbor was a movie that caught my attention for a long time. Ever since I first heard of it, and since the first time I heard of that white boy, Josh Harnett, I haven't stopped hearing about those two. Pearl Harbor literally exposed Josh Harnett to the public eye, so I obviosly thought this movie was something to watch.I must say the movie sets were awesome, and all the battles were perfectly arranged so it would look extremely real. But what got my attention the most is that the movie is &quot;not another war movie&quot;, it is more than that. I must confess it almost brought tears to my eyes, and I must say that it's hard to catch me crying during a movie (and no, I'm not considering myself a super-macho-man...it's the truth). My personal oppinion is that this movie uses the context of the Pearl Harbor battle as a secondary plot to cover the main one, which is the love triangle represented by Harnett's, Affleck's and Beckingsale's characters. I can say this movie makes you think a lot......would you or wouldn't you fall in love with your best friend's girl if he dies?? Would this be something to feel ashamed of?? I think this movie really shows what true friendships are about...they're all about giving your life to save the one person who has always supported you since you were little.The DVD version of the movie takes you behind the scenes of the movie, and also lets you watch the great vide for &quot;There You'll Be&quot; by Faith Hill. I recommend you to buy this movie if you're not bothered by long films and/or romantic movies masked as war movies, and of course, it's a top buy if you have a Home Theater Entertainment System like the one I've got at home!	4.0	Pearl Harbor: War and Love	2002-04-21	5	4	1

Of course everyone knows the setting and plot, but the &quot;story within the story&quot; is very engrossing.  It's hard to mix romance and action without one or the other suffering, but here the director did a superb job.The attack sequence at Pearl Harbor was done extremely well and with great attention to detail.  You will see camera stunts that are incredible!  One of the best parts of the movie is the portrayal of FDR by Jon Voight, and Jimmy Doolittle by Alec Baldwin.The only problem with the movie is that I would have liked to see the dynamic between the main protagonists played out a little more, especially at the end.  Otherwise, quite entertaining and well worth the time and money.	4.0	Great Movie, Great Cast!	2001-12-11	11	5	6

CGI is photorealistic, ships blow up real good, bullets strafe the water with individual clarity and under the surface with frightening realism.  Swooping camera angles that follow planes and bombs give a breathtaking view on the combat.However, the rest of the movie is pure by-the-numbers dreck.  Obviously hoping to capture some of Titanic's worldwide repeat business success, Bruckheimer and Bay lead us to and past the attack on PH through the lives of three people who of course endure tragic circumstances, misunderstandings and conflicted loyalties.  There was not a single original instance in the entire storyline, every development was telegraphed far in advance, and the dialogue was atrocious.  Supporting characters are, at best, one-dimensional, and recognizably taken from previous war movies' ""Barrell o' Stock Characters."" One of the air force mechanics is named ""Gooz"" fer crying out loud. ...Bay's MTV-style photography worked very, very well in the hyperkinetic ""The Rock,"" but here, it is too slick, too apparent, and we are always aware that we are watching a movie -- something ""Titanic"" helped us successfully to forget.Go see ""Memento,"" ""Moulin Rouge"" or something else with artistic merit, and wait for this one to be released to home video."	2.0	Trite Story Ruins Realistic Depiction of Tragedy	2001-05-29	8	5	3

I wonder if he ever bothers to read the cruddy dialogue in his scripts or is he too swamped in the logistics of his set-piece blow-em-up action scenes.  Does the 2nd unit shoot the rest of the flick?Anyway, the Pearl Harbor attack and the raid on Tokyo are doozies!  Really fabulous movie magic action and worth seeing!  Since that is about 30 minutes of this near 3 hour turkey, you gotta a lot of dumb characters played broadly, trite dialogue, and boring love story to sit through.  About the depth of a Sgt. Rock comic book.  The performances across the board aren't worth talking about, so I won't.  The photography is pretty.I wish  Bay &amp; Bruckheimer would play fair and create a DVD of just the airfight over England, the Pearl Harbor attack, and the Tokyo raid.  About 30-40 minutes and sell it for $5 bucks.  Now that would be just treatment of the audience and give you about what is worthwhile for about the right price.Since a little over 1/4 of the movie is the only thing worth seeing, that is the only reason it even gets 2 stars.	2.0	30 Minutes over Pearl &amp; Tokyo....and it's Over!	2002-01-08	3	1	2

An excellent performance by Ben Afflect, backed up well by JoshHartnett. I think we will be seeing a lot more of Kate Beckinsale in the near future.

Watch 'Pearl Harbor' and you'll have all the reason you'll ever need to blow your brains all over that cheap DaVinci print hanging on your bedroom wall.Directed by Michael Bay, mastermind of such craptasterpieces as 'Bad Boys' and 'Bad Boys 2' and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer of 'Kangaroo Jack' and 'Flashdance' fame comes this epically horrid World War II love story.  The lame story focuses on two losers(Ben 'Phantoms' Affleck and Josh 'Halloween H20' Harnett)who both are in love with a complete slut(Kate 'Van Helsing' Beckinsale).  They obviously shouldn't have fallen for this upscale prostitute but instead should have gathered all the native Hawaiians and stoned the crap out of her Mary Magdelene style.You would figure that a movie called 'Pearl Harbor' would actually be about the events that took place there.  Instead we get a pathetically acted, horribly scripted, and all around lame pile of fecal-tinged love story that overshadows the epic event that was the bombing of Pearl Harbor.Maybe I'm being too harsh, but if you like piss-poor and melodramatic excrement, then this film just might be your cup of tea.  Myself, I rate 'Pearl Harbor' slightly better than 'Dirty Dancing', but tied with 'Titanic' as the worst movie ever made.	1.0	A Trillion Billion Dollars Well Spent	2005-09-12	10	6	4

Was I ever wrong. It was filled with action mixed with romance that is not blown way out of proportion, and is actually more realistic than the pictures of what romance is supposed to be from James Camron's Titanic. I went to go see it again two more times, and I can't wait till it's release date on December 4th, 2001.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3GGKVDQM7E4VJ	Atreides	"First, let me say I've read a lot of reviews of this film and have the reviews of numerous veterans I know who liked the special effects and action, not the story. I am a historian myself. I read ""A lot"" about World War 2, and numerous other wars. I love history. I read history books and biographieslike other people read novels.When I read that this movie was being filmed, and who wouldbe starring, I dismissed it right away. To me, ""Tora,Tora, Tora""was the best film I'd seen about Pearl Harbor. I had ""no interest"" in another attempt by Hollywood to recreate it....When it was released to theatres, I didn't rush out to see it.I read the reviews then, and figured I'd rent the movie when it was out on tape, and be ""done"" with it. Nope!I got the video of the movie as a present. I watched it, andwhile cringing at some of the casting...Jon Voight as President Roosevelt...Alec Baldwin as Billy Mitchell!, I enjoyed it.Is it ""entirely"" factual? It is NOT. If you've watched and owned as much Hollywood versions of war, though, how many of them are? I think people in my parent's day were a little more tolerant of those films then the people I read here. This movie was never advertised as a remake of Tora, Tora, Tora or asa documentary. The director and film company ""did"" seek theconsultation of numerous veterans. I don't beleive this movie disrespects them in any way.I liked the basic plot of two lifelong buddies fightingover a girl. I didn't like the script or the movie's length.I have the Director's Cut on DVD,and I've watched the movienumerous times...It's not great,but its not as bad as some here have suggested. If you want more factual films watch a documentary. Neither the director, nor the film company ever said this movie was one.

However, in this case, they failed miserably. The characters are shallow, the dialogues and the script ridiculous, the acting - well even all of Hollywood's stars couldn't save this doomed project.Put all that aside, the Pearl Harbor attack sequence, which is about 30 minute longs in the middle of the movie, is worth watching, especially if you have a good home theater system.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AOGRRHUO45LD0	"""aurapsi"""	This movie presents a mixed bag, of sorts.  On the one hand the discussion about how the Japanese were able to take us unawares was excellent, even if it was very brief, and the bombing of Pearl Harbor is very well done, but it probably could have been a little shorter without losing its intesity.  On the other hand the love story probably should have been toned down quite a bit.  The love triangle, while very well done, probably could have been dealt with in half the time it was given, again without losing much of impact of it.On the acting side Josh and Ben did a good job with their characters and Kate did a fairly good job, but she was a little stiff.  On the other side though, I didn't think that Alec Baldwin was able to pull off Dolittle at all.  Jon Voight as Roosevelt was fine, for the most part.  Jon's only real problem was when he was in garden during the Dolittle raid, I don't think he was able to handle that well.The special FX were great, but the explosions lacked the realism that the CGI planes had (which is ironic since the planes were fake and the explosions were real).  The explosions don't really seem to look right for the size that they are portraying (keep in mind that I have not seen any explosions of this scale first-hand...)  The CGI planes are superbly done and look awesome.  Aside from a few manuevers and some of the crashes the planes perform wonderfully, the animators did an excellent job of mimicing how WW2 fighters moved.Personally, I'd say that you should watch this movie at least once, just so you can have an idea of what Pearl Harbor was like.  But, as an alternative, you could also watch Tora Tora Tora, which is a slightly better version of the same events.	4.0	It could have been an hour shorter...	2001-05-26	0	0	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3KTD2S4DCZJEZ	"Aurora ""aurora619"""	Pearl Harbor is a good movie, but I had some problems with it.  First, the movie was too long.  They tried to weave a love story into the movie and this takes up the first hour of the film.  Second there are some historical inaccuracies; American army pilots NEVER fought with the English before America officially entered the war (but this didn't stop Ben Affleck!). Third, in order to retain the pg-13 rating the producers decided to cut out the blood.  So you have a war movie without blood, I can understand toning down the gore, but NO blood?  Fourth, The movie drags on and on and on...by the time they characters move to Hawaii you are rooting for the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor just to end the movie.  However not all is doom and gloom for this movie, there are some spectacular dogfight scenes.  The special effects are great and the 45 minute long attack scene on Pearl Harbor was spectacular.  The movie did infuse some historical accurate details such as: the American radar operators detecting the Japanese planes on their way to Hawaii only to blow them off as American planes, The U.S. Navy detecting a Japanese mini-sub BEFORE the attack and fail to put the base on alert, Cuba Gooding Jr. plays as a navy cook that during the attack takes up arms against the Japanese Zeros by firing one of the deck guns (That did happen and the U.S. Navy named a ship after the cook!)  All in all this is a good movie, but a little long.  I can only describe it as Titanic meets Saving Private Ryan (without the blood and guts).  This is a good date movie for the guys; the girls will like the love story.	3.0	Two movies in one....too long!	2001-07-08	3	2	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AW1LVOB9K3S8M	"""austenfan2002"""	This is a well-made movie and its worth seeing but be forewarned that this movie is not without its faults. First of all its a war movie and they kind of focus on the three love triangle too much. They should've just focused on the facts and not the love theme.I think that it was overdramatic, it was way dramatic, more than usual and it shows. I think that the director did a poor job and frankly three love triangles are getting old. If they had to weave in a love story, they should have left out the love triangle. It was silly and pointless in a war movie.Anyways I liked it overall and I even own the movie, however it has its faults. Hollywood had their chance to make something out of it, but instead they failed to tell the story of Pearl Harbor the way it happened. They didn't tell it as well as they could've.Pearl Harbor was considered a flop at the box office because it didn't make as much money as the studio expected it would.	3.0	Good but it does have its faults	2002-02-01	2	2	0

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3TELYDFO5XOID	"""avalancher"""	Well, the historical accuracy of the movie is very very good. BUT, it seems like Two people directed the movie. One for the war/flight scenes. And another for the romantic part of the movie, which amounts to a measly love triangle. Kate Beckinsale's acting is really bad. Not many emotional expressions. Ben Affleck was okay, and so was his best bud Josh Hartnett, If the love triangle was done away with, i would have given this movie a 4-star rating. But sadly, the scripting during the romantic scenes really isn't well done. The flow between Kate's involvement with Affleck and her involvement with Hartnett just isnt there. It takes more than just mentioning &quot;Three Months Later&quot; for a woman to really fall in love with another man. A good way around would have Josh Hartnett fall for the girl at the same time as Affleck, only to find out that his best bud is in love with the same girl. But then, I am not a director am I? The sound effects are awesome. The &quot;chicken&quot; scene between Ben and Josh during the Pearl Harbor attack is just appalling and totally unnecessary. Also, there was not only a single scene with the Kamakaze. The editing of the movie was quite well done (except for the scene in the train where Kate's relates her experience with Affleck to her friends). Jerry Bruckheimer did his job though as the film was glamourous. The recreation of Pearl Harbor was majestic. But the heart of the film, the director failed to produce something good. Really, the bad ratings given to movie is all Bay's fault. Poor guy. Also, the fact that Affleck and Hartnett managed to shoot 7 planes at Pearl Harbor is totally overdone. All the bullets fired at them seem to mysteriously &quot;bypass&quot; them. But everytime they fire, a Jap Plane falls. Sorry to say, this film is just similar to Titanic, as it has firm historical accuracy, with a loosly written romantic storyline. This film CANNOT be called &quot;Epic&quot;. Special effects are quite good. The Pearl Harbor sequence is one of the best war scenes. But I give that credit to Industrial Light and Magic, and Jerry Bruckheimer.	2.0	Worth ONE watch.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	ALR35EFI69S5R	"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman"""	"The problem with attempting to recreate one of the 20th century's most infamous events is that all of us know too much and are much too jaded to relate to the all-too predictable, often trite, and pot-boiling storyline linking the main three characters in this adventure-romance version of the Japanese attack on the U.S. Navy deep harbor facility in Hawaii that became the outbreak of World War Two for Americans. With movies like ""In Harms Way"" and ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" already telling the story so well, what could another film offer? While all of the actors do a credible job in delivering their performances, most of it seems like D&eacute;j&agrave; vu all over again. Once again, this seems more than anything to be due to the fact that we are all quite familiar with the string of events based both on our own educations as well as with altogether too many movies about the Japanese sneak attack.Moreover, the entire attempt to give Ben Affleck's character flying experience by thrusting him into the battle Of Britain as an American ""volunteer' is hokey and historically inaccurate. And his disappearance in a flaming wreck off the coast in a dogfight with ME-109s seems most contrived of all. Yet, in spite of all these objections, this movie is well worth watching, not only because it zooms spectacularly past the Pearl Harbor event and covers later action against the Japanese, but also because the special effects are so fabulously accomplished that this version of the actual attack, with its ingenuous interpretation of the attack and battle sequences, is destined to become the definitive interpretation of the historical event. I have watched that portion of the DVD over and over again, for it takes the viewer on a breath-taking excursion into the skies above the islands, and virtually recreates the atmosphere of the battle so vividly that it becomes an unforgettable experience.Amid all the historical controversy regarding whether or not the American command structure had advanced warning and allowed the carnage to take place, the silly romance that plays out its personal history is of little consequence, and the viewer finds it hard to worry too much about the characters amid all this excitement, all these explosions, and all these attack sequences so lavishly and expertly threaded together. This DVD package has a lot of ancillary material that adds to one's understanding of what it is that happened at Pearl Harbor, and what the roles of the flyers, sailors, nurses and others were in coming to terms with what happened that day. This is an interesting and captivating movie event, although I would advise the viewer to concentrate on the visual effects and not got bogged down by the romantic aspects of the movie.

It fails horribly. Everybody knows the history of Pearl Harbor, so, no need to get into it. The effects in this film are wonderful, of course, but that's the only thing to reccommend. The actors are pretty good. Josh Hartnett is definitley a big star in the making. Jon Voight, as the President, was wonderful. The movie drags on too long with nothing happening. They want so desperatley to have that special romantic magic llike in &quot;Titanic&quot;, but they have no clue on how to go about doing that. It's just bad. The heroes and survivors of Pearl Harbor deserved better than this. It's obvious that they are trying so hard for a memorable film. They fail horribly.

The performances of all the main characters, especially those of Josh Harnett & Kate Beckensdale in the contrived, pathetic love story angle just blew all my interest out of the water. It's almost like Bay and the gang didn't know what story they wanted to tell - a straight up war story would've been the best route with the capability of the special FX at hand. But no....they tried to serve all crowds and all tastes. They failed horribly - we didn't want a ""chick"" flick, we wanted a story of valor and heroism. Give Tora! Tora!

Sure, it's a blockbuster, but the movie is far from getting a Best Picture Oscar nomination, except probably for the special effects and sound effects.PEARL HARBOR is counting the days until and after the Day of Infamy, December 7, 1941, all the while spinning a somewhat uneven romantic triangle between Kate Beckinsale, Josh Harnett and Ben Affleck. Affleck and Harnett are top-notch pilots, while Beckinsale is an adorable nurse whom they both love.PEARL HARBOR is a uneven movie that tries to be the ""Titanic"" of 2001, and turns out to be a pale imitation. Sure, it's not good, but it's far from being a expensive piece of eye candy. What we get from the movie is countless cameos from Cuba Gooding Jr. and dozens more; an uneven romantic subplot with the most awful romantic dialogue there is; a frightening, realistic 30 minutes as the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor; and a sad ending.I prefer TITANIC over PEARL HARBOR because the story focuses more on the characters and events surrounding them, whilst PEARL HARBOR unevenly paces the many subplots it's sagging with, no tension as the battle rages on and off the battlefield, and all of the characters aren't fully fleshed out.If you're looking for a good tear-jerker, this isn't your flick.

People, by the hundreds, died in the most horrific of ways, and, I'm sorry, watching Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett run around pumping their fists and gunning down Japanese planes didn't make me feel &quot;pro-American.&quot; It made me think that the filmmakers were exploiting an event that's clearly beyond their artistic grasp and manipulating it to make a film that they think the &quot;American public&quot; would digest.Luckily, this dismal, badly-written and completely silly film essentially failed to make any money, which reaffirms my faith in American tastes a bit.	1.0	So bad it's appalling.	2002-02-04	9	7	2

To me the downside of the movie is the fact that far too much time was devoted to the love triangle, and not nearly enough time was devoted to the ""behind the scenes story"" of what the personnel in both Hawaii and Washington D.C. actually knew about what was about to happen to the naval and air bases located on the island. It is the opinion of this author that the movie ""Tora Tora Tora"" was of greater interest because of the detail which it went into regarding the planning of the attack as well as what was going on in Washington. In conclusion I would recommend that anyone who is a fan of military movies see ""Pearl Harbor""."	3.0	Peral Harbor	2002-02-11	0	0	0

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A15OJV8DNAGG9U	Big_Dave	This movie is great.  I think it got a lot of bad press because people didn't realize that the main focus is on the characters lives at the time of the attack.  Yes, the movie is called &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, so it seems like it should be on just the attack itself, but these days, you have to have identifiable characters.  As far as the war aspect of the movie, it is dead on.  Except for two small parts.(I won't list them just in case you haven't seen the movie).  And, anyone who liked &quot;Titanic&quot;  can say nothing against the love story in this movie.  In closing, definitely see this movie and decide for yourself.  As for me, I loved it!	5.0	AWESOME!!!	2001-12-10	5	0	5
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3QLZ79JF6R1A4	Bigflu	I give the movies special effects 4 stars, but the actual plot and acting negated it back to 2. Ben Affleck is just plain horrible and Josh Hartnett did little to improve my low opinion of his acting skills. And I'd like to ask what happened to Alec Baldwin? He used to do movies like Hunt for the Red October, now he's doing bad General MacArthur imitations? Guess he shouldn't have passed on 'Patriot Games' for 'the Shadow' huh?Well now that I've given my opinions on the actors, if you can call them that, let's get to the plot. It's not enough to recreate the film based upon the tragedy itself that occurred, we've got to have a love story in it? One that made me laugh histerically.I mean this movie is just an over-budgeted flop that has attempted to get some of the attention that was stirred up when they recreated another tragic event to film, the Titanic.Just like that other Affleck flop, Armageddon , this movie is great for those with the attention span of about 15 seconds. You know, like the average MTV viewer.	2.0	Bad movie about a bad moment in history.	2002-10-17	4	2	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A565PMDP4YNU4	Big Joe '83	"I'll just say this and bring it to the table; Pearl Harbor ain't that bad.Have you clicked that ""No"" button yet? Great, I'll continue.Sure if you're a war buff you'll pick out inaccuracies, perhaps find it a tad offensive (Don't you love it in action films when a character is about to swear before being blown up to kingdom come? ""Oh, son of a... *BOOOM*"") and that whole love story might turn even the most forgiving viewer off. However, as a film buff, a VERY forgiving film buff, I've got to hand it to Michael Bay; he recreated a beautifully contructed romanticised view of the forties and the whole bombing sequence is impressive and compelling to watch. The big budget certainly shows in the film even if the script sacrificed a little intelligence, but this is a Bruckheimer production with Michael Bay in the helm; all you can ask of them is a hell of a ride and nice set designs. (Good soundtrack too.) Also, I'm not being sarcastic or anything, but even though this film is about a dead serious subject matter and set 60 years in the past, they still managed to figure out how to slip in product placement from Coca-Cola. Now THAT'S clever.I've always had a feeling this film was critically panned because the critics didn't want another Titantic on their hands. I don't like Titantic because that story dosen't interest me; people get on a boat, boat hits an ice berg, boat sinks, everyone dies, the end. Pearl Harbor on the other hand does interest me, it's a pure escapist fantasy that reflects a certain time in history where America was jolted to join in fighting the ""people's war"". If you want to watch an anti-war film, watch Platoon. If you like war and want to pretend you're anti-war so you don't sound like a blood lusty nut, watch Saving Private Ryan. If you want to see a big budget homage to classic war films of the forties, give Pearl a whirl."	4.0	RUN FOR THE HILLS! IT'S A POSITIVE REVIEW!!!	2005-01-26	12	7	5

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A25HYPL2XKQPZB	Bill Garrison	Pearl Harbor is just like Titanic.  Both movies tell the story of a terrible true-life events.  To make it interesting, they throw it a love triangle that is destined to end in tragedy.  For somereason, everyone loved Titanic while Pearl Harbor was loathed by critics.  I liked Pearl Harbor better, but not by much.The action and special effects are great and Pearl Harbor has nothing to be ashamed of in this regard.  I do believe the movie needed a human interest story to make us care more about the characters.  But that is where this movie fails.  They try to hard to create conflict between Afleck and Hartnett, when there is already enough conflict around.  There should have been one man and one woman, with the coflict revolving around whether or not he survives.This is a good movie but not one I would want to see again.  Still it is better than the overrated Titanic.	3.0	Titanic in the skies	2002-07-16	3	1	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AOU3TTRXVVXXE	"""billhaunt"""	Well It finally came out! After being pushed back sevral times the vista edition of Pearl Harbor has finally been released. The package itself is a great deal and the extras can take hours to sort through. A highlight for me being the interactive attack feature which lets you view the film, on the set, and a cgi animated storyboard of the film. while the film is quite long and in some places dowright boring the attention to detail rivals that other monster Titanic (tho I enjoyed pearl harbor much more). if you're a fan of miltary films, liked pearl harbor, or just interested in the movie making process definitely pick up this copy of the movie. but be warned the added footage of the attack is in some spots quite graphic (think saving pvt ryan but scaled down) it's a great film and should be added to any collection. also if you've purchased the older dvd there's a coupon to get five dollars back from buena vista video!;)	5.0	Better DVD package than the original release	2002-07-09	3	0	3
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2POYXTGSPSW7O	Bill Hensler	"This one the worst WWII movies I have ever seen in my life.  If you think this movie is good then read a history book.  This movie is so wretched it makes some of the WWII propaganda movies put out by both sides look good.  The future is here and it's banal.Some of the people who like this movie didn't like ""Tora, Tora, Tora"".  What can you say to that?  There are people who like Kool-aid instead of a good wine.  Paris Hilton would like the movie ""Pearl Harbor"".This movie makes little sense and has poor special effects.  You get to watch computer generated Zero fighters dance across the screen.  Yep, nothing is more convincing than a bad cartoon.  The movie takes four old Perry frigates and puts them on fire.  The real Pearl Harbor ships, like Arizona class battleships, look as much like a Perry class frigate as a 1920s Ford dump truck looks like a '80s era Ford Mustang.  The only people who are fooled are the uninformed.There is only one - count it one -  good special effect in this movie.  That is when the battleship USS Oklahoma capsizes.  And a good viewer will just wish that was spliced in with ""Tora, Tora, Tora"".There are many out takes in this movie that are directly ripped off from ""Tora, Tora, Tora.""  About half of the air field attacks were taken from that movie.Bottom line here, folks.  Pearl Harbor does not just suck, it blows.  Ben Afflect is a pretty boy and is not convincing as a good military officer.  His best movie is ""Mall Rats"" and he fits that part.  Josh Hartnett redeems himself with the movie ""Blackhawk Down"", one of the best war flicks ever made.  In Pearl Harbor movie he is terrible.  Perhaps his pay check didn't clear the bank, who knows?  Then there is John Vought as FDR?  Please.  He should be on Mission Impossible.If you like this movie then stick with your MTV.  Paris Hilton will be calling to see if you want to go dancing.  Kool-aid served with ice and a peanut butter sandwich is pretty good.If you really like historal movies then get ""Tora, Tora, Tora"", a five star movie.  If you want to find about Pearl Harbor then read ""At Dawn we Slept"" by Gordon Prange.If you want to see raw hate on a movie then surf to steelnavy.com and post on the discussion board how you liked ""Pearl Harbor"".  It would be like hitting a hornet's nest with a stick.  Every time you hit ""refresh"" on your computer window you'll get to watch the posted hate messages multiply.This movie would get a minus Star, if possible.  It is a black hole of a movie.  It takes in perfectly good ideas, actors, and turns it into a blackness.  It's terrible.The worst thing is we can expect to see more movies like this in the future."	1.0	Worst WWII movie ever!	2006-02-22	7	4	3

As for the movie, either you love it or hate it & no one will change your mind. But it is technically spectacular & the bonus features including hour long History Channel documentaries make it worth the price even if you never watch the movie. The R rating, directors cut is for about 60 seconds of additional war gore that makes the movie a bit more tolerable for those who believe the love story angle is emphasized too much. The only special feature on disc #1 with the first couple hours of the movie could be the most important 2 minutes on any of the 4 discs. It is titled ""Why letterbox"". Disney gives a short course on how much more you see with those evil little black bars that people dislike. They show everyone that you get more, MUCH MORE, when you get a movie in widescreen.

The three MAIN things that annoyed me were;1)the contrived and poorly acted whole love scene, relationship build up thing. If you could actually relate to the characters it would have been less offensive, but I've seen better acting in a Punch n' Judy on Blackpool promenade. A film about a relatively recent major event such as this deserves to be shown accurately (and NOT trivialised into some kindergaten love triangle).2)The American centred, gung ho, flag waving, tripe that seems to pervade Hollywood these days. Hint for the inept director of this monstrosity- not showing the stars and stripes every two minutes could save something up to half an hour of screen time. Best quote to illustrate my point- the RAF bloke saying to Ben Affleck persona ""if all Americans are like you God help anyone who wages war on you""(or something to that effect). Pleeeeease.3)This film is an example of the present 'political correct culture' in America, that is more offensive to all sides than showing events accurately. Cuba Gooding Jnr, who i think is a fine actor,puts in a rather annoying appearance as the token black guy, and the Japanese are sanitised beyond belief, in order not to offend the lucrative Japanese market. If anyone is in doubt of the double standards of hollywood, please watch The Patriot, and watch ACCEPTABLE levels of racism.However, despite the above flaws, i have a new found respect for Affleck. Man that guy is great. He gets everywhere. Flying in the Battle of Britain, crashing in the Channel then miraculously surviving throught the night, popping back home to fight, then instantaneously make up with the Matt Damon clone, reunite with Girl, pretty much single handedly put up the defence of Pearl Harbor, shooting down numerous Japs. Then, as if America does not have enough well trained bomber pilots, he is drafted in to fly the Doolittle raid. Thats what you call a hero.In case you did not grasp the message contained in this review, I will reiterate. My good deed of the day is to strongly urge you not to buy/watch/go near this 'film', and save your hard earned cash for more enjoyable pursuits. You could buy a tin of paint, paint a wall and proceed to watch said paint dry, a veritable barrel of laughs compared to the agony of watching this film"	1.0	STOP. Don't do anything you may regret.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AHCVWPLA1O4X8	bixodoido	I was really excited for this movie.  I love historical movies, and I think they do a lot to help us understand the world, and the events that made it what it is today.  Little did I know that this movie would have no more to do with Pearl Harbor than a stage for one of the cheesiest, poorly done love-triangles ever.Unfortunately, I found myself outside the intended audience of this movie.  Since I'm not a 14 year-old teeny-bopper, I don't think Josh Hartnett 'is hot' and I don't think he's a good actor.  That pretty much sums up the entertainment value of this movie.  If you don't think Hartnett or Affleck are hot, don't watch this movie.Not only was this movie lame, it was three hours long.  Take out the first 2 1/2 hours and leave the raid at the end and you'd have a fairly decent (though short) movie.  By this point of the film, though, I was so bored and irritated that I HOPED they'd both die.I've seen everyone praise the scene with the attack on Pearl Harbor, but I wasn't that impressed.  Just because you make a lot of stuff blow up and a lot of people die doesn't mean it's entertaining.  I thought we learned that with Titanic.The love story is old and worn-out.  The acting is not that great, and some of the lines are downright corny.  The historical aspect of this film is nearly non-existent, and even what little exists is grossly inaccurate.  So, if you just like to see Josh Hartnett get sweaty, watch this film.  Otherwise, stay away from it.	1.0	worn out love story and sinking boats? -- that's not history	2002-09-19	28	21	7

My grandfather was at Pearl Harbor (bugler West Virginia), he talked about it all the time, he saw the movie and he agreed with me. He liked the battle scenes, but thought the love story was dumb too. I think we both wanted (and I'm sure I'm not alone on this one) an updated version of ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" I think Michael Bay would have been better off doing that, and having the Doolittle raid at the end rather than the lame love story. Make it more like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and less like ""the Notebook"" It was supposed to be a war movie not a chick flick!

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1P7O2PAA8H1DD	Blade329	Sorry, but I just have to laugh at all these 5 star reviews.  This movie is utter and complete trash!!!  I really have to scratch my head at the plot of this thing.  With all the real stories that went on that day, the producers felt it was much better to create this preposterous fictional love triangle.  Anyone who has ever read anything about Pearl Harbor knows there were plenty of interesting REAL stories that were going on about REAL people.  Unfortunately, the producers want to treat movie goers like kids and assume you want to see fake cliche stories that have been done to death.  Okay, fine.  Let's move on to the BIG problem I had with this movie.  Ben &#34;Superman&#34; Affleck.  I think Mike Bay must have had a serious man crush on the guy or something.  Affleck is in your face and all over the screen.  He is in Britain downing down German planes.  He gets shot down, but survives without a scratch.  Next, he's pulling sailors out of the water in Pearl, he's barnstorming out a hanger, he's shooting down Japanese planes with ease, he's giving blood in the hospital, he's flying bombers off of an aircraft carrier, he's bombing Japan, he's gunning down an entire platoon of Japanese soldiers..........and he gets the pretty girl.  Whew!!!  Busy day for big Ben.  I'm surprised he didn't get a red cape to go with his flight suits. Meanwhile, the film gives about 10 minutes of token recognition to a real hero, Dorie Miller.  I think they did that just to give Superman a breather,  Heck, its hard work taking on the entire Japanese military on your own.  They also add a few more &#34;filler&#34; scenes like that.  You know, unimportant things like tactics, historical information, and trivialities like the entire reason why we were attacked.  Micheal Bay doesn't have time for such things.  He's too busy thinking about what he can blow up.  It also seems he doesn't have time for technical advisers on the set.  The movie is so riddled with historical inaccuracies that it defies description.  I suppose the response to that would be that history is ignored to a point so that the movie would be more &#34;entertaining&#34;.  Which really makes you wonder why someone would choose America's single greatest military defeat as entertainment that teaches so very little.  This movie is not concerned about history nor does it care about why this battle even happened.So, viewers with no interest in WWII, but love cheesy chick flicks, will probably like this movie a lot.  To me, this movie is an insult.	1.0	Superman Ben Affleck to the rescue.....weeeeeeeeeee	2002-04-23	0	0	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A617JMDSBJ6L3	B. Larson	Let me start by asking you a question.  When DVD's came out, weren't you happy that a long movie like 'Titanic' would be able to fit on one DVD and not split into two discs like on video?  I'm sure you would answer yes, so that begs the question, what is the purpose of splitting 'Pearl Harbor' onto 2 DVD's?  It is stupid if you ask me.  That is the only reason why I gave this 1 star rather than 3.The movie itself was ok.  The special effects were good, but you could tell that they were special effects, and that always detracts from my enjoyment of a film.  I thought the story was really two movies in one, a love story and a war story.  Each one would have been great on its own, but mixed together they just make for a long movie.  I also thought that Ben Affleck was not that good, and over acted for most if not all of the film.I would not suggest buying this DVD because the film is split onto two disks, and the movie was not that great. Hope this helps you stay away from this purchase.	1.0	Not worth the money for this DVD	2002-04-24	4	3	1

Oh, word to Micheal Bay, kick your casting agent, because you don't score any brownie points for signing up Private Ryan B-strings (Tom Sizemore.) I heard Touchstone is putting him in yet another war movie (Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down) WITH JOSH HARTNETT!!)Is hollywood that hard up for actors that will weather boot?3. For everybody that keeps whining about how hard critics are, remember this: It could be a relative of yours up on that screen, and would you want to see that much saccharine coming out of thier mouths when you heard they were going to be in a respectable, intelligent war movie? Your answer betrays your character.4. As far as romance injected into history, I will defend TITANIC to the death. Kate and Leo had chemistry to spare, and the dialogue was very convincing, though anachronistic. It struck a deliberate middle ground between soap and high art.5. TITANIC had the decency to be 95% accurate. Some arguments will never be settled on that boat, but as far as Dec 7 was concerned, there is too much interesting documentation to allow equal amounts of cinematic non-sense. Why did the Japanese hate us? I don't think you get it out of this movie, or its extras.6. The most appealling thing connected to this movie was the teaser trailer with the Martin Sheen voice/over. Somehow, since the studio must have wanted to be consistant, they completely filched on us and left it out of the Trailers section.Thanks a lot!!	1.0	Listen Very Carefully:	2002-01-09	1	1	0

The historical inaccuracies were glaring from the beginning. The acting at best was medeocre and the romance was completely ineffective.  Even the much applauded 30 minute battle seemed to be a little to prestine and precise. It looked great, but did not have the grit or edginess to make it feel real.  Michael Bay's MTV style of direction doesn't help this type of movie.

You'd fit in a Lot more as a film critic. If ""Pearl Harbor"" is Any Different than what you Expected...What on Earth were you Expecting? I, like Everyone I Know, walked out of the film with my Expectations Perfectly Matched. This 3-hour Titanic sized Triumph was Exactly how I Imagined it to be and I Positively Enjoyed Every Minute of It.The real Pearl Harbor may not have been an Easy target for the Japanese, it was Supposedly Very well guarded, it was a Long way away and it's Waters were too Shallow for their Torpedos, but the Film ""Pearl Harbor"" is an Easy target for today's Critics and Audiences who seem to Delight in Bringing down the Big boys. Those people who walk into these films with their Minds already Made up, they'll Try to bring it down, but ""Pearl Harbor"" is Unsinkable.Of course, like All films (except ""Die Hard"" and ""The Big Lebowski""), ""Pearl Harbor"" has its Flaws, but they are quite minor and hopefully the DVD version of the film will fix them. Firstly, Cuba Gooding Jr's and Tom Sizemore's Characters have been Cut down to barely Nothing. They are two of the Least Developed Characters in the Film. The Scene on the boat that is supposed to show the relationship between Cuba's character and his Commander (played by Peter Firth) runs for about 15 seconds. If a Directors Cut isn't released, or there are no Deleted Scenes on the DVD, I'm going to be Much less Forgiving than I am now. Tom Sizemore's role is handled a little better; at least he wasn't billed as a Star like Cuba was. The Treatment of these 2 characters is the One and Only Reason for my 4 star instead of a 5 star rating.And now to the Performances. Ben Affleck is a Hero and he is Quite a Good Hero at that. He is basically a More Likeable, Less-Cocky version of his role in ""Armageddon"". Josh Hartnett plays Second Fiddle and he plays that fiddle well. Tom Sizemore and Cuba Gooding Jr are Terrific in their Limited scenes, more of these two would have resulted in Far better Critical and Commercial Success, as Everyone I have asked rates them as the two most Interesting Characters. Kate Beckinsale is also quite good, but like many Female Reviewers have Stated, How Hard is it to Act like you're in Love with Affleck and Hartnett. Dan Ackroyd and William Fichtner have virtually Cameo roles, but they make the Most of them, especially Ackroyd who plays it Deadly Serious. Overall, its Alec Baldwin and Jon Voight who Steal the film out from under the Young Cast. Alec gets your average Flag-Waving Dialogue and makes it Memorable, Jon gets Better than average Flag-Waving Dialogue and makes it Equally Memorable. Both Actors show that these Young fellas have a Lot to Learn if they want to be Remembered one day. Other performers worthy of a mention are Ewen Bremner (as the Stuttering British guy), Mako (as the Japanese Voice of Opposition) and Colm Feore (as an Admiral at Pearl).This film Is the Definitive Telling of the Tragedy. Like with ""Titanic"" there will Never be a Pearl Harbor film to Top this one, they just Can't do it. ""Pearl Harbor"" is a Real and Worthy Recreation for the Survivors of the Bombing and those who weren't so Lucky, while it also serves as Great Old-Fashioned Entertainment for Modern day Audiences, well, at least those of us who don't go to movies for the Sole Purpose of Picking on them."	4.0	If &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; Differs from your Expectations, then...	2001-06-15	3	1	2

This let-down possibly has something to do with the length of film which runs around 3 hours. The only reason I do give film 3 stars is due to incredible special effects, which involved a lot of computer tech. The writing is not there and acting is lukewarm. There is also too much emphasis on love story which makes this seem very Titanicesqe!  A good World War II epic, such as the Longest Day or Saving Pvt. Ryan does not need all that time wasted on some silly love triangle. The romance in the movie focuses the audiences attention on just that, and I came away feeling shortchanged because this was supposed to be about Pearl Harbor, and not about 3 knuckleheads and their love triangle. I would have much rather gone to a seminar and listened to survivors of Pearl Harbor give their real life accounts.	3.0	Not worth all the hype, but solid	2001-06-29	3	2	1

Michael Bay should have shifted the movie's focus from those 3 and put it on cuba gooding's character since he played a real life hero from the aftermath so the movie could have been a biopic instead of a crappy romance saga. so you're probably wondering why i bought this film in the 1st place and i'll tell you why. Simply because i am a fan of the director, the visuals are breathtaking (Hawaii never looked so good), and the Pearl Harbor bombing scene is an excellent workout for your surround sound system.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A4BNZ1OSBO77S	Brent Wigen	"With the glut of WWII movies that have popped up since ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Thin Red Line,"" there were bound to be some cheesy ones. Pearl Harbor, unfortunately, fits this bill. They took a story that needed no embellishment and embellished the heck out of it, to the point where you get a 3-hour movie with a story line that winds like a mountain road and has a terribly predictable ending.If, instead of inserting a goofy love story, they had focused on the battle of Pearl Harbor and the subsequent events, they could have made an outstanding movie. Even a remake of Tora! Tora! Tora! would have been wonderful given the advances in special effects, but instead they chose to jam about two years of warfare (from the Battle of Britain to Doolittle's raid) into a three-hour movie, and subjugate the whole thing to a convoluted love triangle.There were obviously some concessions made to keep the movie to a PG-13 rating, and I can't really complain about that; the director did the best he could, and made some nice decisions to portray the horror and confusion of the attack, while still limiting the gore.Why do people keep casting Ben Affleck for these roles? Am I missing something? Josh Hartnett wasn't terrible (at least he was believable at times), and I will never complain about seeing Kate Beckinsale, but Affleck tries too hard to be emotional throughout the entire movie, and you can tell he's trying. His performance was downright hammish. He makes a good cynical smart-aleck, but most intense emotions elude his range.There are a couple of scenes in this movie that do stand out as excellent portrayals of history. This is especially true when Ben Affleck finally gets into the war with the RAF. The romanticism of the battle is immediately erased with the stark reality of what he has just entered. The battle scenes in general are very well-done, especially considering the constraints that the PG-13 rating requires, along with the variety of combat that was filmed.As a whole, the DVD contains some interesting materials, including some historical stuff and a ""making of"" featurette, which make for some interesting viewing.Bottom line: A subpar movie with a few good points and some solid extras included in the box."	3.0	It was bound to happen...	2003-05-21	2	1	1

Are you a Michael Bay fan? If not, you're not going to like it. Count on all the Michael Bay movie tricks, the 360, beautiful ladies, male bravado....but I love all that stuff. To claim this movie doesn't have soul or depth isn't accurate. A compelling love story, and even more compelling friendship are where I anchor my love for this movie.I'm not a movie critic, or a history buff.

Make me thinkAmazing cinematography and extreme watch ability make this one of my favorite action/drama films, period. I'm reviewing the 2 disc DVD, I don't know if the blue ray has the film on one disc, but I'd recommend a one disc viewing as there is only about 45 minutes on disc two. Since I dont like to interrupt any movie viewing the break between disc one and two kind of messes me up a little, but that's really my only complaint.Wreck diving footage of the Arizona at the end of the film really takes me back to visiting Pearl Harbor last year. Since the attack happened 30 years before I was even born this movie just makes me want to learn more of the actual history. I do NOT judge it for taking some story telling liberties, there are plenty of good film that account the actual event. An amazing soundtrack applies the polish to what I consider a very very good movie. Take All this into account and you'll enjoy it I think.	4.0	A movie fans movie	2013-01-29	0	0	0

This might be the worst WWII film of all time and I'm including Ronald Regan's ""Hellcats of the Navy"" in the mix.  You'd think it would be hard to screw this up, but somehow they managed to do it.  I can't even begin to cover all of the glaring historical inaccuracies of this film.  Most of the historical problems are covered in detail by real history buffs on the web.  Search around on Yahoo and you'll find dozens of sites poking holes all over this movie.  If you think you're seeing the story of Pearl Harbor in this film you are badly and sadly mistaken.  I actually found myself laughing hysterically at some of them - - e.g. American P-40 fighters outmaneuvering Japanese Zeros and beating them in a dead climb - - Ben Affleck, purportedly a fighter jock, getting the nod to fly level bombers off the deck of a carrier for the Doolitle raid - - Ben Affleck joining the Brits and flying a Spitfire in the Battle of Britain a YEAR after it was over.  It was ridiculous from start to finish.  Add to that the fact that Affleck is about as good an actor as a 2x4 piece of pine and you have one crappy movie.  Want to see a pretty decent movie about Pearl Harbor?  Rent or buy Tora Tora Tora - - the graphics are not up to snuff but they're pretty good and they get the history right.  GOD did this movie stink.One redeeming quality . . . this movie at least makes a token effort to tell the story of Dorri Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who manned an AA battery on his own (not his job), shot down at least one Japanese plane and who was the first African American to earn the Navy Cross . . . the Navy's second highest award for valor second only to the Medal of Honor."	1.0	Bad History = Horrible Movie	2002-09-13	11	8	3
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1IO29Z0AHY77S	britimport@yahoo.com	"""Pearl Harbor"" Sink or SwimThe film ""Pearl Harbor,"" opening Friday across the United States, will stir up more controversy than did the film the 1970 film ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"".  The 1970 film was far less biased than the new Touchstone Pictures film; it showed the attack from both the American and Japanese sides. The new film emphasizes a love story throughout the film between Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale) and two Army Air Corps pilots, Rafe and Danny (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett). The film gives us 40 minutes of special effects action.The problem studios run into when either period pieces and/or culturally sensitive films are made is getting ""it"" right.  ""It"" is historical events in the proper sequence, correct historical figures, dates, and the like. In the case of films involving different cultures, depicting the characters of a particular culture is a sensitive undertaking due to stereotyping and personal biases.I grew up in Hawaii and clearly remember ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" being filmed. The sight of fake Imperial Japanese Naval aircraft flying over Pearl Harbor and Hickam Air Force Base raised concerns and no doubt many memories from almost 30 years ago. The concerns at the time were not for the safety of island residents expecting another Pearl Harbor attack, but that the local island residents and tourists population which was majority Asian would not take offense to such a film being made. Concerns were put to rest when it was learned that the film would show both sides viewpoints in the attack, the film having American and Japanese screenwriters and directors accomplished this.""Pearl Harbor"" is an American film, made for hard-core biased American audiences. The film is not meant to be even handed in its judgment of the Japanese actions before, during, and after the attack. Unlike the 1970 film, which was generally well balanced representing both sides, ""Pearl Harbor"" stereotypes all Japanese as being enemies of the United States. The studio has already felt the backlash from Asian American civil rights organizations; the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) has voiced its alarm over the potential hatred and actions that may come from this film.We will see in the next couple of weeks how the studios handle any fallout that may occur as a result of the film. Touchstone Pictures parent company Disney is releasing the film in slightly different versions in Japan and Germany, emphasizing romance over battle. This was a very expensive film to make; one source of potential loss of revenue may be in the Asian film marketplace, where typically American action films do well. One interesting item is that if the film is not seen as an insult to Japanese people in the Asian marketplace, then it may be seen as a patriotic film in the sense that Japan kicked the stuffing out of the United States and that the romance in the film is secondary. This idea may play well in Japan, but for Japanese and Japanese Americans residing here in the United States this film may lead to a renewal of stereotyping and hatred.

It included a little bit of everything you look for in a movie: happiness, romance, sadness, funny, action-packed, ect. Yet it included just enough historical information but just the right amount. So that you didn't leave the movie theater unsatisfied because it was very boring and you thought that you may as well just go home and watch the history channel, but you also didn't leave thinking &quot;Why did they title it PEARL HARBOR when i still dont know what it is.&quot; Most people left the movie theater satisfied because they got to watch a great movie but also learned a bit about what they were watching. And another thing that made it so cool to watch on the big screen (or even when it comes out on video and you watch it on your own television) is the graphics and computorized scenes looked all so real. You couldn't really even tell that it was done by a computer. And another reason that i personally liked it so much was because of that hot actor, Ben Affleck. Not only him but josh hartnett, kate beckinsale ( i'm not sure if thats how you spell her name) alec baldwin and MANY other actors and actresses were outstanding in this film! I would have to say that it is definetly a 2 thumbs up kind of movie. I know i'm gonna buy it the day it comes out!!!	5.0	definetly movie of the year!	2001-06-18	6	1	5

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2625DQVR3TOZ1	"""brodie_bruce"""	I wish there was a rating of 0, because I totally agree with the critics that panned it. I had to sit through three hours of one of the worst movies ever made, and I want those three hours back.  The horrible plot is only held together with the multi-mullion dollar effects, which are great, but movies that are this long need a plot.  There are way too many overdramatic scenes, I flat out laughed for some of the most &quot;dramatic scenes&quot;. By the end of the movie there is no sense of pride and admaration that comes from war movies because the ending doesn't seem too dramatic, after having every war cliche shoved down your throat.  With the amount of dramatic license hte writers took for this movie, you think that they could have writen a interesting story.  The whole first part of the movie could have been cut out, Affleck's character goes to Britain to fly with the RAF.  What the hell does the Battle of Britain have to do with Pearl Harbour, nothing thats what.  The scene is to allow for an uneccesary love triangle.Don't think that being Canadian makes me dislike this movie because I thought Saving Private Ryan was great. If you haven't seen Saving Private Ryan, and want to see what a good amercian WW2 movie looks like, see it. Pearl Harbour is just an excuse to show special effects.	1.0	DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE	2001-06-11	16	12	4
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3D2VTO51FRS4Z	"""brokenmachine"""	To sum it up: This movie isn't a tragedy, the fact I paid $8.50 for it is. Never trust this company of producers. I should have learned after such classics as &quot;Con Air&quot; and &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds.&quot; If I were a veteran of this battle, I would be beyond pissed off at some producers who want to make a quick buck off of the gullibility of the public and for disgracing what happened that day.To put it mildly, we came to see a war movie, not some corny romance. While such elements work when they're used to motivate a main conflict (i.e. Braveheart) it can't be used as the entire plot. The characters are so dry and boring that you're left to sit for about 2 hours before anything happens. The bombing was actually shorter than this movie.Shortly after the aftermath of the bombing, the movie should be done. However, it seems Jerry Bruckheimer and friends have some extra cash to blow, so they extend the movie another hour to make another bombing run. This movie was marketed to be about the bombing in Pearl Harbor. All the battles in the movie (including the seemingly randomly created ones not involved with the central plot at all) add up to about 30 minutes. Thats not much considering the movie is 3 hours long. There are better and more realistic war movies out there. Don't waste your money like so many else have.	1.0	What a tragedy	2001-06-23	0	0	0

Does it deliver for historical accuracy? Well...pretty much.I am glad the movie includes lesser known, real life characters and their exploits. Have to give the filmmakers credit for that. It also captures the real feel of the 40s, where travel and communications aren't like they are today. The scene where the nurses arrive at Pearl Harbor is great. They are wide-eyed in this place they had never seen or been to before. I thought that was a good touch.Love story- lots of reviewers mention the cheesy love story. As a 36 yr old, I have no idea just how difficult relationships are in times of war. I thought PH actually did a good job portraying the conflict of feelings, and how one deals with the uncertainties of wartime romance. The phenomenal Battle of Britain scenes help keep the movie from bogging down until the immediate build up to the Pearl Harbor attack.Glad it ends with the Doolittle Raid- that story deserves each and every opportunity to remind the world about those incredibly brave sailors and airmen. Also glad scenes of the Eagle Squadron at the Battle of Britain are included as a way to remember those brave american volunteer airmen that helped the British in their most desperate hour.Remembering the film is entertainment...sit back and enjoy the aerial scenes and turn up the volume!	4.0	Don't forget..this is entertainment!	2002-01-18	3	0	3

The only good thing about this film are the special effects, and even then I prefer the more primitively done Tora,Tora,Tora from thirty years before because it actually tells the truth about what led up to the raid in painstaking detail, actually taking the time to show what is going on with both the Japanese and the Americans and the mistakes and misjudgements made on both sides.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A27PCEXWJM4RTD	Candice Gibbs	Pearl Harbor, in my opinion, has followed one of the finest traditions of all love stories: the boy-girl-boy's best friend triangle. This timeless tale, while not entirely historically accurate, creates a memorable portrait in ones mind of how things were for many of the people caught up in the tragedy of that December morning.For those of you who are history buffs: if you want a historically accurate film - why are you looking to Hollywood? This was not meant to be a history lesson. If you want one, you need to turn to A&amp;E, Discovery, or the  History channel! There are liberties taken, as there always are, and while we may not always agree with them that is the way that Hollywood chooses to portray it. You shouldn't go to a movie to pick it apart for the inaccuracies, but to enjoy it for what you find there.Treasure this movie for what it was meant to be- a heartbreaking love story that draws you into the lives of three charachters that you will not soon forget. Guys and gals alike, bring a box of tissues, because Pearl Harbor will draw you in, make you love them, and then...well, I guess you will have to go see it to find out!	5.0	Bring a Box of Tissues: This is a Tear Jerker!	2001-07-01	2	1	1

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2YXMN40D7WTGP	casualsuede	If you want reality, go elsewhere. Pearl Harbor is based on fictional characters. Even the events that go on in the movie are subject to trivialization. Still, in the vein of Titanic, the movie offers an engaging (even with the banal dialogue) film with the grand majesty of Pearl Harbor.Rafe and Danny are childhood friends whose dream is to fly for the US Military. They both enlist and join the a training squad in Long Island, where Rafe (Ben Affleck) meets Evelyn, a nurse and they fall in love. However, Rafe has joined an US fighter wing going over to fight in England. The two part their separate ways.Danny and Evelyn are both re-assigned to Pearl Harbor and rarely see each other. However, the apparent death of Rafe brings the two together and they slowly fall in love. However, Rafe is not dead and comes to Hawaii and feels he was betrayed by his best friend and the woman he loves. Meanwhile, Japan has sent their fleet and has launched the attack that would bring the US into the war.After Pearl Harbor is destroyed and their Pacific Fleet decimated, the US decides to strike back at Tokyo and Rafe and Danny volunteer. However, it will be a tragic mission for one of them, as only one will return alive from this suicide bombing run.I know little of WWII and even less about the events leading up to the invasion, however, you do not come to see a Michael Bay movie for a history lesson. If you like Armageddon or The Rock, then Pearl Harbor will satisfy the action portion of the movie. However, Bay has matured as a director and does not rely on the rapid editing technique that he is well known for. Although much of the emotions felt throughout the movie are manipulated by Bay, they still have the desired effect of creating a believeable love triangle that will only work out for two of the three participants. The main problem about the triangle is the &quot;Harlequin&quot; dialogue that only seems to exist in moviedom and that the ending sort of cheats the audience.The performance by Ben Affleck range from annoying (his arrogance) to good (he can do syrupy romance well) but his (Rafe's) chemistry with Evelyn is electric. Kate Beckinsale deserves more than half the credit, being luminous in her screen role. She plays Evelyn as a straight arrow and seemed believable as young woman from the 1940's. Josh Harnett makes an ernest attempt as the third man, but he lacks chemistry with Beckinsale and the ending exploits this at the end, making the love triangle more formulaic.The only other SF extravaganza I have seen this summer is The Mummy Returns and let me tell you. Pearl Harbor makes it look like that the later movie was made by first year SFX students. The battle scenes are extravagant and engaging and are the best I have seen in a long while.If you want to see a movie that will satify the die hard action fan, the romantic and the summer movie fan, than this one is the Summer movie of 2001 (so far)....Historians need not apply....Rating: B+	4.0	An excellent fictional tale, but no history lesson.	2001-11-14	3	1	2

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AS7WCDNTCA4I2	"Cate Bruckman ""Cate Bruckman"""	I believe that an RAF Eagle Squadron pilot might have been shot down and saved by the Resistance. My uncle was in the squadron (KIA) and I've done a good bit of research about escape routes for downed airmen. Many did get back to England. And it might have taken months, hiding out from the Gestapo the whole time, waiting either for passage through free Spain or a French fishing boat back to England. But in this film, what is so ludicrous, is that Raf (Ben Afflick) evades capture in occupied France, gets back to England and doesn't write immediately to his girlfriend and best friend. Also, the RAF would not have declared dead a pilot who was missing in action, until confirmation from the Germans that they had the body. (I have a copy of a Gestapo form filled out when my uncle Ft. Lt. Jack Mooney was killed). They would have waited at least six months to pronounce death. So, to make this love triangle work, the filmmakers expect us to believe that Raf was 1. Pronounced dead, 2. Transferred back to the US forces from the RAF (notice that he's back in his American uniform...really? Before Pearl Harbor? The Eagles weren't transferred to the US Army Air Force until August 1942--Raf would still be flying for the Eagle Squadron), 3. He doesn't write to his friends, 4. He makes it all the way from England to Hawaii. Ridiculous. Still two stars for the rush of seeing Spitfires.	2.0	Raf, you idiot!	2013-05-21	3	3	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A21VGNU5959O85	CaterpillarGirl	"Pearl Harbor, a black day in american history, and even blacker day when Michael Bay gets a great idea to make it into a movie. Historically this movie blows, Casting wise(except for Cuba) this movie is a bore-fest. There are so many true stories about that day, but they choose to make this movie a love story with some unrealistic war scenes on the side. I have a great story about that day, its about a real american hero, who was put into this movie as a sidenote, when he should have been the beginning middle and end. :This is a story about Dorie Miller its a love story about him and his country.Dorie was the ship's heavyweight boxing champ on board the USS West Virginia (BB-48).Dorie was awarded the Navy Cross by Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, on board USS Enterprise (CV-6) at Pearl Harbor, 27 May 1942, for heroism on board USS West Virginia (BB-48) during the Pearl Harbor Attack, 7 December 1941.He was killed on 24 November 1943 in the line of duty while serving in action on board the USS Liscome Bay (CVE-56)during Operation Galvanic, (the seizure of Makin and Tarawa Atolls in the Gilbert Islands). While cruising near Butaritari Island, a single torpedo from Japanese submarine I-175 struck the escort carrier near the stern. The aircraft bomb magazine detonated a few moments later, sinking the warship within minutes.In 1973, the USS Miller (FF-1091), a Knox-class frigate, was named in honor of Doris Miller.The Full StoryDoris Miller, known as ""Dorie"" to shipmates and friends, was born in Waco, Texas, on 12 October 1919, to Henrietta and Conery Miller. He had three brothers, one of which served in the Army during World War II. While attending Moore High School in Waco, he was a fullback on the football team and he worked on his father's farm.On 16 September 1939, he enlisted in the U.S Navy as Mess Attendant, Third Class, at Dallas, Texas, so he could travel, and earn money for his family. He later was commended by the Secretary of the Navy, was advanced to Mess Attendant, Second Class and First Class, and subsequently was promoted to Ship's Cook, Third Class.Following training at the Naval Training Station, Norfolk, Virginia, Miller was assigned to the ammunition ship USS Pyro (AE-1) where he served as a Mess Attendant.On 2 January 1940 was transferred to USS West Virginia (BB-48), where he became the ship's heavyweight boxing champion.In July 1940 he had temporary duty aboard USS Nevada (BB-36) at Secondary Battery Gunnery School.On August 3 1940, he returned to West Virginia, and was serving in that battleship when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.On 7 December 1941, Miller had arisen at 6 a.m., and was collecting laundry when the alarm for general quarters sounded. He headed for his battle station, the antiaircraft battery magazine amidship, only to discover that torpedo damage had wrecked it, so he went on deck. Because of his physical prowess, he was assigned to carry wounded fellow Sailors to places of greater safety.Then an officer ordered him to the bridge to aid the mortally wounded Captain of the ship.He subsequently manned a 50 caliber Browning anti-aircraft machine gun until he ran out of ammunition and was ordered to abandon ship.Miller described firing the machine gun during the battle, a weapon which he had not been trained to operate: ""It wasn't hard. I just pulled the trigger and she worked fine. I had watched the others with these guns. I guess I fired her for about fifteen minutes. I think I got one of those Jap planes. They were diving pretty close to us.""During the attack, Japanese aircraft dropped two armored piercing bombs through the deck of the battleship and launched five 18-inch aircraft torpedoes into her port side. Heavily damaged by the ensuing explosions, and suffering from severe flooding below decks, the crew abandoned ship while West Virginia slowly settled to the harbor bottom. Of the 1,541 men on West Virginia during the attack, 130 were killed and 52 wounded. Subsequently refloated, repaired, and modernized, the battleship served in the Pacific theater through to the end of the war in August 1945.Miller was commended by the Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox on 1 April 1942, and on 27 May 1942 he received the Navy Cross, which Fleet Admiral (then Admiral) Chester W. Nimitz, the Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet personally presented to Miller on board aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CV-6) for his extraordinary courage in battle. Speaking of Miller, Nimitz remarked:This marks the first time in this conflict that such high tribute has been made in the Pacific Fleet to a member of his race and I'm sure that the future will see others similarly honored for brave acts.On 13 December 1941, Miller reported to USS Indianapolis (CA-35), and subsequently returned to the west coast of the United States in November 1942. Assigned to the newly constructed USS Liscome Bay (CVE-56) in the spring of 1943, Miller was on board that escort carrier during Operation Galvanic, the seizure of Makin and Tarawa Atolls in the Gilbert Islands. Liscome Bay's aircraft supported operations ashore between 20-23 November 1943. At 5:10 a.m. on 24 November, while cruising near Butaritari Island, a single torpedo from Japanese submarine I-175 struck the escort carrier near the stern. The aircraft bomb magazine detonated a few moments later, sinking the warship within minutes. Listed as missing following the loss of that escort carrier, Miller was officially presumed dead 25 November 1944, a year and a day after the loss of Liscome Bay. Only 272 Sailors survived the sinking of Liscome Bay, while 646 died.In addition to the Navy Cross, Miller was entitled to the Purple Heart Medal; the American Defense Service Medal, Fleet Clasp; the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal; and the World War II Victory Medal.Commissioned on 30 June 1973, USS Miller (FF-1091), a Knox-class frigate, was named in honor of Doris Miller.On 11 October 1991, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority dedicated a bronze commemorative plaque of Miller at the Miller Family Park located on the U.S. Naval Base, Pearl Harbor."	1.0	What the Movie Should have been.	2005-09-21	9	7	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1YRQHM1C2JL8G	Catherine	To all those people who have said this movie is full of cliches, I have to ask - have any of you actually opened a history book, or better yet, spoken with a World War II veteran?  I saw this movie with my grandfather, who was actually at Pearl Harbor, and this movie touched both of us in a way that critics obviously can't grasp.  Don't they understand that those &quot;cliches&quot; were really how it was back then?  It was life or death during that time.  Couples didn't know if they'd ever see each other again.  The movie &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; captured that desperate feeling.  I have to think that anyone who gives this movie a bad review mistakenly went to a screening of Tora! Tora! Tora! instead.	5.0	Don't pay attention to the critics!	2001-06-20	24	14	10
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A17N23WXA7EAF	"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter"""	"""Pearl Harbor"" is an action-packed, highly entertaining historical drama that tries as hard as it can to get it right. But be warned that in order to enjoy this film, you have to endure all of its clich&eacute;s and historical inaccuracies or simply fast-forward past them as I wound up doing.LOVE STORYFirst and foremost, ""Pearl Harbor"" is a love story, or as one witty viewer put it, ""Two guys love one woman and-oh-incidentally, some ships get bombed in Pearl Harbor."" The two guys in question are childhood friends, Rafe (Ben Affleck), and Danny (Josh Hartnett), who grow up to be fighter pilots and fall in love with the same navy nurse, (Kate Beckinsale). The film begins promisingly enough with the boys standing on Rafe's farm admiring his father's crop dusting maneuvers, joyfully oblivious to the toxic pesticides wafting down upon them from the sky. A few years later, the boys have grown up to be fighter pilots training for a war that everyone knows will inevitably reach American soil and borrowing the tower buzzing plot device from ""Top Gun"". Rafe is the first to fall in love with the pretty naval nurse but when he is presumed dead after getting shot down over the English channel, his best friend and his paramour become an item. But Rafe manages to return home alive and suddenly the three principle characters are caught in a dilemma of who loves whom and who love whom even more. It's an interesting scenario, but unfortunately, the film takes the sentimental and campy route. You may feel differently but I had to fast forward past all of the dialog between Rafe, Danny, and the nurse. It wasn't hard to guess what they were saying to each other anyway. In case you think I'm being too harsh, it might help to keep in mind that the film makers ran various love scenarios by focus groups to see what would outcome would most likely appeal to audiences. In other words, they're trying to play you.WAR MOVIE""Pearl Harbor"" is an awesome war movie from a visual perspective but contains some of the most wretched lines in cinema (I just want to matter). For anyone who enjoyed ""Saving Private Ryan"",this film is a must see. The battle scenes, particularly the aerial combat scenes and the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and the launching of B-25 Mitchels from the carrier U.S.S. Hornet are astounding. Be warned however, that the raid on Pear Harbor is simply painful to watch. The film captures the carnage and the tragedy of sinking ships as well as sailors getting burned, strafed, bombed, and drowned with gut wrenching precision (some of which it lifts from ""Private Ryan""). It's both difficult and fascinating to watch and you will definitely come out of it with renewed compassion for survivors of Pearl Harbor and other acts of illegal military aggression.The film also does an admirable job of presenting the dangers and difficulties of America's counter attack against Tokyo, using carrier born B-25 bombers. Unfortunately, this too is mired by melodrama, and the presence of Rafe and Danny.HISTORICAL DRAMAHere's where the film tries to get it right and rarely succeeds. I commend Director Michael Bay for trying to portray the Japanese and in a humane and objective manner. In one scene the Japanese high command reveals that the U.S. oil embargo against Japan has left it with only enough fuel to power its war machine for eighteen more months, essentially amounting to a military death sentence. The film also credits Admiral Husband Kimmel for his awareness of Pearl Harbor's vulnerability and his ill-fated attempts to protect it.It is worth noting, however, that the film botches the historical record in a few vital areas. At one point, an earnest naval intelligence officer announces that the Japanese fleet could easily be tracked if only the Americans could break their naval code. Actually, America did break that code as early as 1929 but for reasons that historians still debate today, that intelligence was never made available to Admiral Kimmel. In another scene the American executive government announces that it must cannibalize the Pacific fleet in order to send more equipment to the beleaguered British forces in Europe. Nope-sorry-but that is incorrect in two respects. First, prior to Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt launched an aggressive new ship-building program that would have completed one hundred new naval vessels by 1943. In addition, the pacific fleet was not cannibalized as the film suggests, but as a matter of luck or deliberate human intervention, its best ships including all aircraft carriers were on maneuvers in the Pacific during the raid on Pearl Harbor. As horrible as the losses were on that day, the damage in military terms could have been much worse. In fact, most of the ships that were sunk in Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941 were WW I relics. This doesn't mean the film deliberately lies when in fact it draws on popular historiography of Pearl Harbor. But if you want a more accurate picture of what happened and why, there are several good books available (""Day of Deceit"", ""At Dawn We Slept"", and ""The Emperor's Codes"") as well as great film, ""Tora Tora Tora"".PATRIOTIC HOMAGEOf course ""Pearl Harbor"" can't help but end with ten minutes worth of patriotic verbiage reminding us how it's always important to suspect foreign countries of evil intentions and to go to war whenever we feel like it, because things would have worked out pretty well if we did so then. I think history and politics are more complex than that but I understand why the filmmakers inserted unnecessary flag waving material in the end. This was one of the sections I wound up skipping over.CONCLUSIONMasterful visual effects aside, this film will not teach anyone a thing about Pearl Harbor. While it may not be as flashy, I highly recommend ""Tora Tora Tora"" for its far more intelligent, inclusive, and objective portrayal of Pearl Harbor. Again, you may want to mute or fast-forward your way through the wretched dialog of this one."	2.0	Hurl Harbor	2003-09-09	4	3	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3O6Q8OZ2IZV90	C D. McLeod	The monumental historical tale of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the events leading up to and following that act are virtually overlooked in this travesty of a film.  What is arguably the turning point of the 20th century is used only as a backdrop for a cheesy, formulaic love story.  The acting is poor, the script is poorer, and the director wants us to forgive these because of the great visuals.  Sorry, Jimmy, but making Hawaii look good isn't exactly a feat of magic.Oh, and for all of the liberal left out there, Cuba Gooding Jr. is tossed in for a multicultural, look-at-the-black-man moment.  His part is entirely unnecessary except to cater to the whiny crowd who'd otherwise complain about the casting.Avoid this movie like the plague.  Buy Tora! Tora!

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A37VV8WJCH6IM	Chad Messer	"If Pearl Harbor has one great flaw, it is that it tries too hard to be the end-all epic - the war movie on the grandest scale. The first ninety minutes and the last, say, 20 minutes of the film are one more or less complete  being. It is an entirely passable, if a little cliched love story, which at its best can be downright touching. The brotherly dynamic between Hartnett and Affleck works well enough that the audience can believe the tension when everything falls apart. The intervening war scenes are visually stunning and well executed, but it seemed as if they were only rewards to the men in the audience who stuck through the love story. Because of this, the film can feel a bit disjointed, but the capable performances of Affleck and Beckinsale keep this from being just an ""effects film"". It never quite reaches the hights that it strives for, but for [crying out loud] it was better than Dude Where's My Car. Michael Bay is the Norman Rockwell of cinema. He should kiss his cinematographer on the lips."	4.0	Two Movies in One	2001-12-05	0	0	0

Adams"""	"While I highly recommend that people buy this DVD, it deserves much of the negative press it has received and should spur lots of discussion and critical analysis both outside and inside the filmmaking industry.The fact that the producers, directors, and writers did such an incredible poor job in preparing the screenplay rivals any similar blunder in the history of filmmaking.The love story almost ruins the film, even some of the scenes between Evelyn Johnson (Kate beckinsale) and each of her two lovers (actually buddies since childhood) are absolutely pathetic, contrived to the point of becoming something out of a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale.I certainly don't object to a ficticious love affair being inserted into what should be basically a docudrama, but this ridiculous triangle, involving Rafe (Ben Affleck) joining the RAF in the Battle of Britain, being shot down, escaping from a sinking plane, and a prison camp, returning virtually unannounced to surprise his former lover and boyhood friend is simply too stupid beyond words.What I'd really like to know is why this screenplay was ever approved in the first place?It's obvious that the filmmakers didn't want to simply remake ""Tora, Tora, Tora,"" but why not?  It's been thirty years and with computer assisted production techniques it would be certainly worth the effort.  Why didn't they take some time to more fully develop the Japanese expansion into China and Southeast Asia, as well as the isolationist climate in the United States?Another weakness of the film is the second ending, Doolittle's Raid on Tokyo.  Alec Baldwin is not the least bit convincing as Jimmy Doolittle.  And, once again the screenplay stumbles by including the two buddies (Rafe and Danny) in the raid.  Of course, one doesn't make it back to the U.S.What's good about this film?  Well, nearly everything else.  The special effects alone are worth the price of the DVD.The accompanying extra features attracted me and added to my appreciation of the film.Even though I come across extremely negative, I highly recommend this DVD, especially for collectors of World War II films."	3.0	Highly recommend for war film fans...	2002-01-23	0	0	0

Of coure, I went into the movie theatre knowing it was a love story. But I laughed and I cried, I don't understand how people could say that there was no humanity in this movie, I just don't understand. I loved the way the attack was also told from the Japanese point of view, so it wasn't a completely rah-rah, go americans type of movie, and the way it proved that if they had just listened to their instincts, it might not have happened.But I loved the love story, it was great, heart wrenching at the end, and the action shots were amazing, and the actors and actresses were perfect for their roles.

People have rated this film so harshly and even after reading their reviews, I still don't understand why. But maybe it is just me. Anyway, ""Pearl Harbor"" involves around two childhood best friends, Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck), and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), who have grown up together and now have joined the military and are based in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. While there, Rafe meets the lovely Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale), who is a nurse at the Pearl Harbor hospital and they soon fall in love. But then Rafe gets assigned to go off into aircraft battle and his plane is shot down into the water. Back in Hawaii, everyone thinks Rafe is dead when he doesn't return. So the devasted Evelyn and Danny are forced to move on and they eventually fall in love. But then Rafe comes back! And Evelyn must choose between Rafe and Danny, but that's all before the Japanese strikes Pearl Harbor. After the horrifying attacks on Pearl Harbor, Rafe and Danny are assigned a top secret mission which could be deadly. And while on the mission, another devasting tragedy occurs, and only one ends up coming back alive.I thought this film was done brilliantly. The cinematography and the visual/sound effects were simply outstanding. The acting by the entire all-star cast (which also includes Alec Baldwin, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jon Voight, and Jennifer Garner) was superb. ""Pearl Harbor"" is a long film (183 minutes), but definitely well-worth it...I almost cried at the ending. The script was also well-done, and I saw nothing wrong with the love scenes--I thought they were a sweet touch to the film. The DVD is also not bad, packaged well with extras. The extras on the two-disc DVD set includes the making of ""Pearl Harbor"", a History Channel documentary on the unsung real-life heroes of Pearl Harbor, DVD-ROM features, and the Faith Hill music video ""There You'll Be"". The DVD is available in wide screen format.I highly recommend ""Pearl Harbor"".Score:98/100A+"	5.0	Underrated war epic.	2002-10-26	6	3	3
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1U0HC6Z37DUZ0	Chris Frost	Pearl Harbor is actually one of the better war movies to come out in recent history, despite some of the other reviews here.  The special effects were quite impressive, especially when you find out just how little they had to work with, and how much military cooperation they were able to muster.  The acting was fine.  And because it was based on actual historical fact (they actually had Pearl Harbor survivors on site to lend their memories and experience) something might be learned from it.  For example, the Doolittle raid.......something that generally isn't taught in high school history classes.  And yet it should be.  Sure, alot of the stuff has been done before, but never all in one movie.  And what movie hasn't had repeated effects in it?  Because a plane blows up in one movie, that means no other movie can include a plane blowing up, for fear of being labelled a bad movie?  A movie is created to tell a story, not simply to introduce new effects.  Alot of these reviews are way off-base.  For example, the reviewer from Germany spends an inordinate amount of time telling how bad the movie is without actually explaining why, other than the fact that it didn't give the Japanese perspective.  Well......the movie is about the American perspective, so go figure.  Including the Japanese perspective would have made as much sense as including the South African perspective.  It has nothing to do with the movie.  And as far as the analogy of making a movie about 9/11......I'm sure that it too, will be no good unless we include the Muslim perspective in a movie about Americans.	5.0	Excellent Flick	2003-08-02	7	4	3

It takes a certain kind of person to enjoy it, I suppose, so I can see how some people don't like it. But I did, very much, and I'd recommend it to anybody. There were a few boring spots but the rest of the movie makes up for it. It had me laughing, crying, and feeling the same emotions that the actors/actresses portrayed. I love this movie, and Armageddon too, since there are people commenting on it, too. I'm watching it right now, actually. Anyways, give Pearl Harbor a chance. Maybe it's not entirely accurate, but you don't go to a movie for everything to be perfect.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2ZDGC1S2QZFU0	Chris Jothi	"As Bruckheimer and Bay count the ticket receipts and collect their big cheque from Disney, we the audience are left in a haze of sheer disappointment; and to an extent, exploitation. Bruckheimer has the ability to take away the art of filmmaking. It is all about product placement, merchandising and sequels. We can witness the bomb's point of view shot in its full 2.35:1 cinematic quality (which is the only good four seconds in the entire movie).This film was terrible. Apart from being funny many times (intentionally and unintentionally) the emotional impact of the hundreds of people dying was almost non-existent. Bay, so concerned about cutting every 5 seconds and showing large American and Japanese flags (just in case we forget who is who), has little idea about exactly what he is trying to do. Bay, who wouldn't know how to register a heartbeat in his unbelievable stereotypes, had no emotion to attach to each bomb dropped and bullet shot. What the attack amounted to was all style and no substance. It was like a video game. Some of the plane battles were so cartoon-like it was as if you were watching 'Pearl Harbour: The New Playstation 2 game"". Granted that these effects are remarkable but we are barely given the chance to appreciate them as we cut to another shot every few seconds.And the love story, so contrived, so inexplicably trite, is arguably the most sickening thing about this film. Affleck and Hartnett are best friends. Aflleck meets and falls in love with Beckinsale but he has to go to England and show the English how to fight a war (the cheek of that!). That leaves Beckinsale alone with only Hartnett to look after her. I leave the rest up to you to figure out.Bruckheimer sure knows how to get good actors to deliver the clunky dialogue. You have Sizemore, Baldwin, Voight and a surprising Hollywood turn from Ewen Bremner. They perform well, and so too do the three leads. Affleck is brash and cocky. Hartnett is shy and charming. Beckinsale is sexy and, well, cries a lot. The three are gorgeous to look at and hold the screen strongly. Considering the quality of the dialogue a lot of credit has to be given to these young stars, whose onscreen charisma should never be taken for granted.It's all been done before though. The love story is there for the teenage girls. The action is there for, you guessed it, the men, and the ""credibility"" factor (Jon Voight) is there for the old people (simply put). Elder Americans are renowned for their patriotism so this film will attract the grey market, which summer movies rarely do.You can talk about the historical inaccuracies but I have come to accept that Hollywood is more concerned with changing history to fit their story as opposed to the other way round...Their answer to every incorrect detail is ""it's a movie."" If they are so unimportant why not film Pearl Harbour in present day in the Sahara desert?Great DVD..."	1.0	So same time next year?	2002-03-16	4	4	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ	Chris Kennison	I had a lot of preconceived notions about Michael Bay before I watched Pearl Harbor.  You couldn't have dragged me to go see this at the theatre.  In fact, I waited till $1 rental day to watch it.  I personally think Directors like Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich are everything that is wrong with hollywood... and I wasn't disappointed.Too many movies go straight to production because of a concept, rather than taking the time and making sure the story is in place and it's something worth telling.  Of course Pearl Harbor is something worth telling, but it has to be more than that.  It's the personal stories that make it such a great and tragic story.Too bad Director's like Fred Zinnemann, Michael Curtiz or Alfred Hitchcock weren't around to give this movie some substance.  Director's of that class are a dieing breed.  Meanwhile, young, visionless, money hungry, let's blow some stuff up, lets keep it moving director's are taking their place.I can just imagine the pow-wow sessions that started Pearl Harbor: &quot;Lets see... the 60th anniversary of Pearl Harbor is coming up, gotta do a movie.  People loved Titanic.  We can't do a sequel to Titanic, but we can do another disaster.  It can happen.  Let's make Pearl Harbor the biggest POPCORN MOVIE of all time.&quot;Popcorn movie....  yes, it is... and it's too bad.  Because popcorn movies are forgettable movies.  Ten years from now, we'll remember movies like Saving Private Ryan and Titanic because they had substance.  Pearl Harbor only joins the list of movies that made big money, but made no impact, like Independence Day, Armageddon, Godzilla and the Patriot.On a positive note.  The movie wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  The performances were good.  KATE BECKINSALE was as beautiful and confident as ever.  The action sequences are incredible and intense.It is a movie that has its merits. Yet, it could have been so much better had the producers taken their time, instituted more ACTUAL and FACTUAL stories and spent more time on the methods of telling a story, rather then pouring all their efforts into attack sequences.Don't buy this DVD.  Another example of what I'm talking about.  The 60th anniversary of Pearl Harbor came up and they had to capitalize off of that, so they rushed out a lesser version of what they're offering later down the road.  That way they can get your money twice.  The movie is divided onto two disks and the subtitles are hard to read.  If you do want to buy this, wait for the special edition director's cut DVD coming out on May 14.	2.0	OH... What could have been????	2001-12-09	13	10	3

The graphics and sound made it fell that you were right their in the cockpit and inside the boats as they were bombed. I am looking forward to going to see it again in theaters and when it comes out on DVD.	5.0	Pearl Harbor	2001-05-27	2	1	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2HWRTEULOBPOP	Chris Purdue	Pearl Harbor is a movie unlike many others.  Most films are fast and entertaining in the beginning and end, and slump in the middle.  At the end of Pearl Harbor, I was bored.  The best part of the movie occurs at about 90 minutes into this three hour monster.  The attack on Pearl Harbor is absolutely thrilling and fast-paced.  It will also bring out the patriotic soul in all of us.  The attack lasts for 45 minutes and is the best part of the film.  The problem with this movie is that the first 90 minutes and the last 45 minutes come no where near the excitement or involvement of the attack sequence.  The love story is filled with cliches and it monopolizes most of the film.  Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale are fair, but Ben Affleck flounders.  Rent this movie;  do not buy it.	2.0	Average At Best	2002-07-04	7	3	4
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AQTV7TAQZPP9J	Chris Stirling	&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is one of my favorite movies. Although it may be a little historically inacurate, it's still very good. It is the story of two pilots (Ben Affleck, Rafe, and Josh Hartnett, Danny) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale, Evelyn). Rafe and Danny are best friends, who eventually are both romantically involved with Evelyn. Meanwhile, they are stationed in Pearl Harbor (though Rafe is in England for some of the movie). The attack hits and the 3 of them must fight for survival. This movie is sad because of the thousands of deaths. The actors and actresses do a good job, and I especially like Josh Hartnett.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3B4UNZQJ99KJB	Chris Tian	This movie was basically two and a half hours of horror. The movie went from nearly bringing to me to tears to making me want to run out of the theater. The love story in the movie down played the historical aspect of the movie. Pearl Harbor was not about happy Disney but about young men dying and giving their lives for the U.S. It is a shame DIsney even released this movie. I would have rather watched Tora Tora which is a true account of the event. Shame on Disney for ruining one of our countries darkest days. At one point I was waiting for the Japanese to bomb Disney World. Don't waste your money.	1.0	Leave it to Disney to ruin an important historical event	2001-05-26	4	4	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1PPBSG5U2EYGY	"Christine L. Loss ""chrissybell"""	'Pearl Harbor' was a nice surprise to me. I had seen some bad reviews and thought it would be a terrible movie. But I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it and have watched it several times for a number of reasons. First of all, the action scenes are fantastic. The movie is slow-paced at first and builds up to the action, but it held my attention. The scenery and the musical scores were lovely, very impressive. The love triangle, although a bit syrupy, was something most women will eat up. Men, on the other hand, will probably be annoyed. But I have to say that I could not believe how adorable Ben Affleck and Josh Hartneck are. Gorgeous does not really do enough to describe these hunks. Josh Hartneck, especially, will leave a definate impression with most women. I haven't seen men that look like this in movies for many years. And there is one love scene with Josh and Kate Beckinsale that left me speechless. Does the movie have faults? Probably, but who cares..I loved it.	5.0	Adorable and riveting	2002-02-13	1	0	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AF1PD7QGWAXJE	Christine Pulsifer	I went in hoping this wasn't going to be &quot;Armageddon 2&quot; and I was very pleased when I walked out.  From what I've heard and read the events that take place are not 100% accurate (mainly with how the Japanese approach the attack), but they are pretty darn close which is to be commendable.  The action and sound are fantastic, the acting is great and their sorrow is believable.I liked it a lot better than &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; mostly because after the storming of the beach in Normandy, the movie was kinda slow for me.  I really liked Alec Baldwin as Doolittle.  He was just how I pictured him in the History Books.  Aggressive and looking for revenge as by the example of putting the peace metals on the bombs as well as writing messages on them before the bombing of Tokyo.I really liked this film.  I saw it opening night and sat behind a row of WW2 war veterans, most who sobbed during the bombing of Pearl. (Which was really hard to see)  I have the utmost respect for war veterans and I figure if the accuracy of the bombing of Pearl Harbor was good enough for them, it was good enough for me.  I'll be buying this on DVD when it comes out.  Thank you veterans for all the hard work and sacrifice that you have given us to keep us a free country.	5.0	&quot;I fear all I have done is awoken a slumbering Giant...&quot;	2001-05-27	2	1	1

Effects thattry to be fairly historically accurate and are pretty impressive...but only have impact because we realize this really happened.The film is far too easy to pick on.  Let's I suppose be thankful that a lot of people over-looked the actual quality and worth of the film itself and considered the fact that so much money, time and effort went to remembering and bringing to a new generation a dramatization of what happened oh so many years ago.  If you're going to spend too much money on a film I suppose better they do one that attempts to recreate history.It would really honor the men and women of the armed forces if they had made a better film however.Tora Tora Tora looks like a masterpiece compared to this one, andyou really should buy yourself a copy of the infinitely superiorFrom Here to Eternity on DVD.	1.0	Harboring very few Pearls....	2002-01-03	4	3	1

I was afraid to watch Ben Affleck after Armageddon, the movie which started his career towards running parallel with Leonardo DiCaprio's.  Ben Affleck was worth watching in his Mallrats and Chasing Amy flicks, but now I wouldn't waste my money on his movies again. I made that mistake twice (Armageddon and Pearl Harbor), I'm not going to make it a third time.The name ""Pearl Harbor"" is accurate for less than half of the movie.  I would have named it ""Titanic in Hawaii"" or something like that.  This movie reminds me what I think NSync would be in movie form.  ($) is not worth the 10 minutes of interesting footage surrounded by (...).  The first time I watched it I had to fast forward to find out if the movie had ANYTHING to do with Pearl Harbor.

There was never a moment in the movie when I was not acutely aware of the fact that it was an over-inflated production.  In other words, I never lost myself in the story.

Ben Affleck and the many wonderful actors helped make this movie a hit.  The acting in this movie was right on.  They could not have cast this movie better than this. You can deffinately feel the emotions behind the experience.  This movie lets you experience Pearl Harbor and the beginning of WW2 without actually being their yourself.  It does not bring any glamor to war like some movies may. I gained a new respect and love for the many vetrans that have given their lives for my freedom and for the many families that had to say goodbye to loved ones and move on with their own lives.  This movie is excellent to watch with a family or a date.  You will need tissues if you're one of those who tend to feel any empathy for others and show it through your tears.  You will never get any closer to Pearl Harbor,unless you were there, than through this film.	5.0	An Amazing Film	2001-06-06	4	1	3
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A209VLJR2ES6GE	Clare	Many people would compare Pearl Harbor to  1997's Titanic. Mainly this is because much like Titanic, the movie is focused on a group (or couple) of people dealing with a tragedy that really effect hundreds - to thousands.Pearl Harbor did a better job at focusing on how Pearl Harbor effected others than Titanic. The first video (out of the duo) is mainly focused on Danny, Reeve, and a nurse. My dad sat and watched it and was feeling a bit annoyed how the writer's could just throw out the feelings other people had to deal with during the war, but all that changed when he watched the second half of the movie.The second half of the movie is mostly about war. They show many Navy fighters shooting Japs planes and trying to escape the target of torpedos: their ships! You feel the emotions of all the  sailors while trying to save each others lives, especially a young black man who works in the kitchen who has to box to earn respect. You see the termoil in the hospitals. Many wounded and near-dead fighters filling the little space they have.Yes, I'm a teenage girl. Yes, I agree Josh Hartnett and Ben Afflak look pretty darn good in this movie, but I didn't like the movie because of that. I loved it because it left me in tears as I saw first-hand of the terror of Pearl Harbor. I never really heard of Pearl Harbor in history class until the movie came out, and it was just so overwhelming.Overall, this is an excellent - but long movie. I do not recommend this movie to people who love happy-movies and despise sad ones.	5.0	Realistic and Touching	2001-12-29	1	0	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	ARZHQFXS3LTP6	Claudia	Pearl Harbor is not only a war movie, it's also a romance. For those who love romance, Pearl Harbor is a film that must have be seen. Despite the fact that the romance story is kind of predictable, it has a context that engages you. For the first 50 minutes of the movie it is an  inspiring love story, then amazing battle scenes sets the action. The fact that the cast is very young, acting in a wonderful place, gives the first part of the movie a romantic atmosphere that is drastically interrupted by the war.The second part of the movie showed the victims and nurses arriving at the hospital. Lots of soldiers arrived wounded by the war and the doctors and nurses had to select who they could help or not, what was doubly impressive. The view of that wonderful place destroyed by the war was horrible.The film has great special effects, when the attacks start you cannot see this without being overwhelmed by the horror of war. The special effects conveys how horrible the war is and the tragic deaths it causes.	5.0	A Good War Movie for Romantic People	2002-04-11	11	6	5
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3CLZNWL39LQLW	"""claurence@bigplanet.com"""	Pearl Harbor has been widely panned by any and all commentators with a keyboard and a website.  Why?  They say it will cause anti-Japanese hate crimes; it was too soft on the Japanese, implying that America's oil embargo caused the attack; the love story is too cheesy; the list goes on and on, with each commentator arguing that the film says the opposite of what the next commentator says it says.  I attended Pearl Harbor wearing the Aloha shirt I had worn to the Arizona Memorial one year ago (during which, incidentally, I saw a portion of the filming of the movie).  Whatever the critics say, there is no way to soft-pedal the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  The thought kept recurring to me, &quot;Thanks for nothing Japan.&quot;  However, I will not be burning Toyotas in the streets.  As for the oil embargo, they had to start the movie somewhere without going into each and every precipitating event in some sort of boring pre-story history lesson.  Considering that the movie was about the American experience rather than the Japanese experience, it stands to reason that Japan's military campaigns preceding Pearl Harbor were excluded.  For America, due to America's unique geographical location and despite all warning signs to the contrary, the attack was out of the blue.  The film portrays this.  Eisner will succeed in conveying to a Japanese audience the emotional toll their nation's action took on young lives.  Most people understand the emotion of a story much more than the history.  Tying together the causes and effects of Pearl Harbor is the job of a historian.  Portraying the emotion of an event is the job of a filmmaker.  In this, Pearl Harbor succeeded.	5.0	Pearl Harbor Critics Panned	2001-06-13	8	2	6

I thought the acting was good, especially from Kate Beckensdale and Ben Affleck. How much research and money went into this movie is apparent as you see the magnifecent Pearl Harbor in 1942- and view it being destroyed. Yes, I know more time than was needed was spent on the love story/triangle thing, and that's why this didn't get 5 stars. Basically, I think this is as good as Hollywood gets- at least in direcion and special effects, anyway. The attack scene will blow you away.	4.0	Better than I expected	2002-07-19	3	2	1

When the best thing you can say about a movie is that the special effects were good, then the movie sucks. The bluray version looks great. A big budget(wasted here) movie like this was obviously shot with great equipment making a prime candidate for a bluray release. Too bad Ben Affleck couldn't act his way out of a paper bag in this one. Almost like he knew how bad this would suck already.

On the other hand, if you ain't in a position to opt out of seeing it (like the scene in Clockwork Orange when they force that feller to watch movies by clamping his eye lids open) then it ain't quite as horrible as some folk say.December 7th is the Day of Infamy and I can see why. Pearl Harbor was a real mess and even if you don't buy in to the assertion that it was a 100% surprise, i.e. that FDR was somehow in the know before the bombs started falling) then you ought to just watch this moving picture (assuming you don't opt out) and see it as another Hollywood product and not a historical documentary. I reckon the only redeeming part of the thing is the special effects, which are pretty good. They got some shorts of bombs falling and the like that will make you scratch your noggin and wonder how in the world they were able to create that image. Otherwise, the acting is flat and the dialogue is uninteresting. Kind of like eavesdropping in on a couple of young love birds at the local Dairy Queen... what they have to say ain't interesting to anybody else so why would anybody else bother to listen?I ain't particularly a fan of Ben Affleck (nee Benjamin Geza Affleck) because I don't see that he has any redeeming skills as an actor, kind of like that Tom Cruise (nee Thomas Cruise Mapother IV) feller. He was exceptionally disappointing in Gigli, but as Shannon Hamilton in Mallrats he actually shone as a luminary thespian. This here film may be Kate Beckinsale's (nee Kate Beckinsale Loe) finest moment - but I will conceed extra points to her part in The Last Days of Disco as being particularly enthralling.Junior liked the bomb scenes and the aeroplanes, and the twins liked the mushy stuff, but me and Mama ended up getting up and going out to the side yard and sitting in the shade watching the pig root around in the sty while we had some cool adult refreshment. I ain't too sure how the moving picture concluded, but I know that in real life the conclusion of the war was that the Allies won.	2.0	Bombs Away (Dream Baby)	2004-12-07	9	2	7

The events surrounding the bombing of Pearl Harbor are dramatic in and of themselves - the silly love story doesn't add anything except an extra hour.  This is just another Bruckheimer/Michael Bay flick - Armageddon in the 40's.  Same generic characters, same generic Zimmer score, same generic shots of tough guys looking cool in slow motion.On the plus side, the picture quality and sound of this DVD are absolutely top notch.  It's almsot worth getting just to watch the half an hour sequens of the bombing of Pearl Harbor.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AE8IBOP3MF64	Clone K	Hello, thanks you for taking the time to read this review. I tend to keep my review on the lighter side of things, but tonight I'm going to be serious for a minute. I am just back from viewing this film and let me start by saying this film is not the greatest film ever made yet not as horrific as the reviewers would have you believe. I have some praise for the film, some disdain, and a little nugget extra for you to ponder. Let's get started with the disdain.The love triangle is not a fun thing to sit through, especially when you know deep down Ben Affleck is going to get the girl (I doubt he would have done the movie if he wouldn't have). This is apparently a typical Michael Bay practice; kill the other male character vying for Ben Affleck's love interests' affection (i.e. Bruce Willis in Armageddon). Another thing I found pointless was the addition of Cuba Gooding JR.'s character. I realize Doris &quot;Dorie&quot; Miller was a very heroic man who is very worthy of the praise he received. But Gooding's portrayal of Miller encompasses less than 20 minutes of screen time, and those minutes really do nothing to help build the film. I attribute this to The Patriot trend of adding a black character to make people think that blacks were, in the end, well noted for there service during times of conflict(war). If you want to see a film about the impact of black soldiers during WW2, see the HBO film The Tuskegee Airmen. It shows the fabled flight division comprised only of black airmen, and the incredible impact they had in the war over Europe, and within the US Army itself. While I could rail on about the race issue I will let it die there. And now let's hit the high points.Despite the typical love story I found my self caring for the characters at some points. In particular I found myself drawn in by Josh Hartnett's character. He is not so over the top as Affleck and Baldwin are, and it is refreshing. Of the main characters, his character seamed the most real. Where as Affleck actually fancies himself as a super hero on and off screen, Hartnett just seams like the normal guy thrust into an impossible situation, the way most that are considered heroes by history are. Also, let's give a huge nod to ILM for yet another masterpiece of visual effects. They keep on showing us that they are the masters on making dreams become realities. Yet in doing so, they have led me to a moral impasse.In the past when films about war, including Tora Tora Tora, were made the imagery was cheesy at best. Even a novice could pick apart the inaccuracies and crappy visual effects, and it is not the film makers fault they just didn't have anything better. That may have been a blessing. We get to witness the biggest military blunder in our countries history in incredible detail. We get to see the soldiers and sailors blown to pieces in stunning fashion. But what everyone in the theatre except for me failed to realize was that these were real people. This isn't a fictitious earth of the future being haunted by an asteroid. The people so precisely being blown to bits are the grandparents of we the twenty something crowd. Yet the herd, grazing and munching on the eye candy just stared in awe of the splendor of Hollywood. I was in awe too, the beautifully done Japanese aircraft coming in low and fast was great. Then as the first torpedo hit and killed the men cleaning the boat, I just wanted it to be over, and the rest of the crowd strapped in for a wondrous ride they compared to scenes from Star Wars and the like. I guess what I am getting at here is I walked out of the theater feeling a huge debt of gratitude to the men who died while brushing their teeth on a Sunday morning and everyone else who left felt they had seen a great action film with a mediocre story. I can only hope my generation is not this shallow. Maybe some pages of history are best left for books. Some things were bad enough being seen by the eyes of the people experiencing it. It is obviously not appreciated by the audience viewing it. How does splashing it out in state of the art visuals and THX sound help it pay homage to the people who died that day when the people viewing it are only hoping it has better effects than the new Planet of the Apes flick? Should we look forward to the Columbine Shooting film or the Oklahoma City bombing film? Hey, I heard Brad Pitt is playing Tim McVeigh, it should be great. I gaurentee they would both make money, if they aren't in the works already. When we as a people can be heard aloud comparing a tragic event like Pearl Harbor to the wonderful cgi work of another tragedy, Titanic, is there any wonder why our society is where it is today?I'll end this here, as I am quickly running out of word space. I would like to thank you for reading my review, and hopefully I've made you think, even if just a little. I hate to sound so preachy about a movie. But my experience tonight at the movies was so bizarre I felt I had to share it. Maybe you should go check it out, just to witness desensitization at its most glorious.	3.0	Some things are best left unseen.	2001-05-30	1	1	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"It's a comment that sure rings true: on South Park, Cartman speaks of an injustice while Michael Bay continues to make movies. While Bad Boys, Armageddon and the Rock had cool action sequences, they were also ADD-influenced in its editing and the emotional parts of the film just rang absolutely hollow. Anyone remember the animal cracker scene from Armageddon? Well imagine a love story that's perfect for Days of Our Lives and you find a really hollow effort but with great effects.Obviously set around the time of the Pearl Harbor attacks in 1941, we actually instead follow 2 pilots Danny and Rafe as they end up falling in love for the same nurse, Evelyn. Rafe goes away, is presumed dead and Danny and Evelyn start a relationship. In soap opera fashion, Rafe comes back who's not happy then the attack starts. This continues until the Doolittle Raid to Tokyo.If you want a great sound demo for your stereo you of course have to cue in the actual attack. Running just shy of a half hour, it's extremely well-done and worth the price of admission, or rent or purchase. ILM did a great job and it of course has that trailer shot everybody loves. Unfortunately it's the main reason to watch the film because it's essentially 90 minutes of bad dialogue until we get there. The same problem plagued Titanic where you can literally divide the film into 2 halves and the first suffers because it took so long to get to the 2nd.The dialogue is that bad with some that are supposed to be inspired lines but come across as laughable, especially Colonel Doolittle's since it's essentially a big speech. The love story is of course laid on a bit thick and it's not a well-written one at that. Another problem is the certain faux-epicness of it all with big slow motion shots with planes flying overhead, big camera moves around people and it just makes me cringe since they have an almost indulgent feel about them.This is of course the big double dip where it includes everything they should've had on the original release. You get the commentaries, production diaries and featurettes as well as some historical documentaries. To add insult to injury, the historical looks have more substance than the actual film does. Oops. The director's cut adds some more gory shots that seem kind of sudden and out of the blue at times, especially with people's familiarity with the normal cut.The effects are great but the film itself has a detached feel about it all, as if it's nothing more than a really cool action sequence. Private Ryan and Apocalypse Now's action sequences where exciting but also emotionally compelling where you felt the horrors of war, here it's just ""look at the neat stuff!"". I'm not demeaning the attack and massive loss of life but this film feels completely hollow in that regard.I have no idea whether to recommend this or not so I'm going to give it the rating of a CR, meaning a cautious recommend. If you buy the film and love it then all the power to you but if you hated it, don't say I didn't warn you, this is Michael Bay after all."	3.0	If you hated this film, it's your own fault for watching it	2006-04-25	2	2	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1UUGCY1HIQZLR	cloudy	"Hard to believe but Jackson says in the commentary for ROTK:EE, that they showed off some pre-vis effect shots(including the following piece of building arcing into the orc army) and preview shots to some hollywood industry heads during early LOTR production before ""Pearl Harbor"" was out and then PH shows off the bomb drop, so now PJ dubs his scene the ""pearl harbor"" shot.As for the movie itself. Remember that idiotic scene where the zeros were strafing the hospital and nurses were all running around in the midst of it instead of staying in the hospital? In fact, the Japanese never attacked the hospital or flew close to it. The carriers and battleships were the main targets, secondary were the factories. That's just one instance of many of ridiculous scenes just to serve Ben Affleck with a love story. The common denominator must be pretty low for the public market to keep supporting Michael Bay's drek. the story could have been set in modern day ""Sex and the city"" type of drek scenario and it  wouldn't make a difference. Just that an important historical event has been lampooned into soap. Watch ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" for something really historical about Pearl Harbor."	1.0	"The bomb dropping shot was lifted from ""Return of the King""!"	2005-01-08	13	10	3
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A24P4XOBMMD9IO	Clyde McCoy	I was one of those that heard the bad reviews of this film and decided if I was going to spend $20 bucks on a movie I would wait for the DVD to at least get something for my money.I just bought this DVD yesterday.  I watched it and I am kicking myself.  This movie is a great blend of romance,war, and friendships.  It is just enough to get you interested in the characters.  The major scenes are without a doubt the actual attack scenes which are real cool.I was upset by only one thing.  The english subtitles to the Japanese dialoge &quot;bit&quot;.  They were micro sized on the screen and you had to be right up on the TV to read them.  That was down right stupid. Why not just have them speaking in english for us folks...????I still give the film a 5star rating cause I moved closer to the set and could make out a few of the last subtitles.  Hey you guys fix that for the 3 disc release will ya?The all star cast is nice.  I liked the friends.  I thought it was well done making them buddies from the same hometown.  That is not uncommon.  It was a bit predictable about the resurrection of Affleck's character.  His character was a bit overblown fighting on 3 continents.  Also he seemed to have an ego as big as &quot;Maverick&quot; from TOP GUN.  Nice acting.  Bad character.In short, don't allow yourself to stay away from the film.  It does have allot to offer.  If you are a WWII buff this is a must see.  I recommed.	5.0	I can't believe I missed it on the big screen	2001-12-05	1	0	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2ZT045NNAHCL7	C Montalvo	It distress me to see all the negative reviews of Pearl Harbor...knocking it for it's lack of &quot;historical value.&quot;  Fact is, it's a MOVIE.  No one would go and pay 8 to 10 dollars to see a documentary - that's what the history channel is for.  The fact is, a love story like that works in a war movie.  It may be cliche, but come on!  It's PG-13 and there's only so much they can do.  Finally, I've recently graduated from high school in a excellent school system near Washington, DC.  I've also taken several history classes in college and all I've learned was:  Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, the U.S. entered the war which we won.  This a day in age where the WWII veterns are dying and their experience is dying with them.  I appluad the cast and crew for making me watch &quot;hunderds of US boys dying.&quot;  It happened, it's important and the love story enables us to sit through a history lesson that needs to be taught.	5.0	Pearl Harbor -- THE MOVIE	2001-06-01	22	16	6

The briefing; the plot behind the name; is nothing more than the typical - i.e. two drop-dead manly flyboys fall for a makeup encrusted portrait of a nurse, thus forming a love triangle...and so it goes. The  film dishonors the men who fought and died at Pearl. There appears to be no overall theme, the characters are cardboard, the plot is shallow, Pearl Harbor has practically been thrown in just so that the directors had something to blow up, and historical accuracy totally flunks out. Had the film really focused on Pearl Harbor, something might have been achieved. But because it had to be written and aimed at the typical teenage audience, it fails miserably.	1.0	Oh please!	2004-08-06	9	5	4

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3M3XBMAXQE3RF	"""creecy_ag"""	When I first heard they were going to make another three hour movie, I didn't think it could ever top &quot;Titanic&quot;. I was wrong! From the beginning to the very end, all of my &quot;movie needs&quot; were satisfied. There was an extrememly passionate and tremdously sad love story (with NO weak characters!). Also, the action and special effects were in a word, amazing!  The beginning and ending were... perfect. The beginning made you think about what was going on and you had to follow every word and name. And the ending, oh the ending! I was literally sobbing, because I had become so attached to Josh Hartnett and his personality as being such a loyal friend. But, I was also crying because the movie was over. Throughout the credits I just sat there and had to remind myself that it was only a movie and they weren't real people.  Something about the plot and characters made it seem so real. Not only did I cry at the ending, but the attack on the Hawaiian islands was incredible. I didn't know too much about the history of the attack of Pearl Harbor, but from the point of view of a friend of mine, he seemed to think that it was historically accurate and he, having known veterans of WW2, was sincerely touched by this movie.  The special effects of the bombing were spectacular and so real, it really made you wonder how awful that must have been. Imagine waking up Sunday morning and looking out into the harbor and seeing sailors, maybe friends, being brutally killed. Then, even when the Japanese pilots had left, seeing all the men trapped inside the ships was heartbreaking.  Back at the airport were Hartnett and Affleck. Two amazing pilots who touch your heart as they, for the moment, forget all hard-feelings and emotions, and fly out into a huge mass of &quot;Japs&quot; and, while wearing hula shirts, do all they can to save the lives of their American comrades.  Not only was the film action-packed, the love-triangle was one like no other.  Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale started it all off with Beckinsale passing Affleck on his eye sight test, even though he couldn't read. But when Affleck &quot;ships out&quot; to England before the U.S. entered the war, Beckinsale never recovers when news comes of Afflecks death. Neither does Afflecks best friend Josh Hartnett. However as the months roll by Hartnett and Beckinsale start an intamate relationship which falls completely apart when Affleck turns up, not dead, but very much alive and very much having a feeling of betrayal. But not much time is given to sort the whole mess out when, the very next day was December 7, 1941, &quot;a date which will live in infamy...&quot;.  The retaliation of Pearl Harbor was an outstanding ending to a truely wonderful movie, not to mention a real tear-jerker. Both of Beckinsale's men went on that secret mission, only one came back. See it for yourself, I guarantee you will enjoy it.I would recomend this movie to anyone from the age of sixteen to sixty. Even if you have no upfront knowledge of the attack of Pearl Harbor, this movie will leave you speech-less and I guarantee one viewing won't be enough!	5.0	This is the kind of movie you don't want to end!!!	2001-07-27	2	1	1

Some said it was excellent; others said it focused way too much more on the love triangle between Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckingsale, and Ben Affleck than it did on the actual attack on Pearl Harbor.  If you are leaning towards believing the latter, well, then ya better straighten up 'cuz this movie it's anything but romance-dominated.  don't believe it when people say that the first two hours are just filled with mushy love because plenty of that time is packed with suspenseful, compelling scenes of the Japanese preparing their attack and well...other things, but i'm not going to spell out entire plot.  IT IS A GREAT WAR FILM.  The special effects are spectacular.  The acting is as true to reality as you can get.  If the movie can move an entire audience to tears, then you know it's gotta be good.  I was captivated by the soaring planes, the blazing flames, and the vast,wonderfully blue oceans.  Pearl Harbor is an excellent portrayal of the attitudes of people--both civilians and those in high authority--during the months, weeks, and days before the attack--they really  did NOT expect the Japanese to target that small lil paradise of an island that was thousands of miles away.  but neway,this is the type of movie that ur jus gonna have to see for yourself.  so take my advice and go see hollywood at its best.	5.0	all i gotta say is...WOW!!! truly spectacular....	2001-06-02	3	1	2

But if you're used to quality products, this is not a movie you're after. ... First of all, it takes ages before the actual attack starts. And what about Benn Affleck saying he was in occupied France? After a few months he returns home. It's no secret Americans know nothing about Western history, but this really is not acceptable.Special effects. Alright, you expect a quality attack, a big overwiew of the Japanese planes bombing Pearl Harbor, instead what you get is a camera who individually follows every aircraft one by one, then the bomb as it's flying through the air, an explosion where you can search for blood. Search thoroughly though 'cause it's like watching the A Team. Even the sound effects are nothing. And then the awful love story, but how come a film like Enemy at the Gates can pull it off to put a lovestory into a war movie? Simple, don't use Michael Bay for such a project.	1.0	Even the longest day had better special effects	2002-04-06	3	3	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2C81OFZL2T48H	"C. Taber ""CT"""	This movie had a lot of potential, but failed to live up to it in so many aspects:1.  The plot was predictable and sluggish.  Everyone knew Ben Affleck's character wouldn't be killed off in the first hour of a three hour movie.  Everyone knew the way the love triangle would be resolved would be by one of the three getting killed.2. Though I agree with those reviews that say that people should not go to the movies to get a history lesson, the (sad) fact of the matter is that so many people get their historical perspective through television and movies that the producers could have provided more accurate historical context without negatively impacting the movie.3. With as much money as was spent in making this film, the producers could have paid a little more attention to details that would have been all too easy to get right.  For example, in the film, there is a US Navy destroyer shown during the attack with the number 1062 on the side, but WWII era destroyers were numbered in the 200s and 300s.  Minor detail? Yes. But since the ship was CGI anyway, why not get it right?  Later, when the Doolittle bombers were taking off from the aircraft carriers, the camera angles alternate between a shot from the tower of the carrier and a shot from under the fuselage of one of the planes (kind of like in Top Gun).  On the shot from the tower, you can tell that the carrier has a narrow deck and no catapults, whereas on the shot from the fuselage of the plane, the deck is wide, angled and has present-day catapult tracks, none of which existed in WWII-era carriers.  Again, a detail that could have been corrected with some simple CG editing.  Also, the script went to great lengths to show how critical it would be for the bombers to be able to take off from such short carrier decks, but then when the moment of truth arrives, the bombers end up taking off from mid-deck!4. Am I the only one that finds it hard to believe the credibility of bleeding-heart limousine liberal actors like Ben Affleck and Alec Baldwin in ultra-patriotic roles?  Again, yes, it is a just a movie, not a piece of political propopganda, but isn't it one of the responsibilities of the casting directors to ensure some measure of believability in the actors they choose to portray the lead roles?Overall, this movie was a big disappointment.  The only parts that were worthwhile were the battle scenes, but they were not enough to carry the rest of the production.	2.0	Great special effects, poor writing &amp; acting	2001-06-18	4	3	1

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2MI81AXZJTWG5	Dallas	I saw this film when it first came to theaters a decade ago. From the trailers, it sold you as a modern retelling of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. What the film gives you however is a Hollywood production with Michael Bay helming it at the seat of his pants.-- Film --Most people here who have reviewed this film have already seen it. And you who probably seeks to understand why you want to buy this version of the film should consider a few things.This film is a very fictional retelling of Pearl Harbor. When you watch this film, you need to remember that most (if not all) of what you see is either slightly inaccurate to greatly inaccurate. Does it mean that it makes it a bad film? From most people who are historical buffs or in general would like to see Hollywood pay respects to those service men who died during the attack - then yes.But if you can take this film with a grain of salt and simply view it as is: Entertainment with the back drop being set in a historical setting. Then this film can be quite entertaining.For me, I've studied this attack extensively as well as World War II itself and I know for a fact that this film is truly far from what had actually happened. Michael Bay - the film's director - it seemed was trying to convey a sense of realism through the telling of our two protoganists. By realism, I mean that the first act of the film takes place in a pre-war America.Love is on everyone's minds as every service men and women are quite young. Michael Bay wanted to catch that moment in time where America was innocent and were not at all trying to jump on the board with the war that was going on around the world. In a sense, it worked.The only problem is, Mr. Bay extends this sense of innocence between our two main protagonists who are both equally in love with the love interest. This love triangle is truly where it makes the film hit a few road blocks. Had he kept it between two people, then it would have been a minor rash on a film that was trying to keep with the time of that era.Historical accuracy for the rest of the film it seems isn't the key in this film. Yes, Michael Bay keeps most things intact but are greatly twisted in the name of artistic license. During the attack sequence, in the Director's Cut, Michael Bay films it in a gritty fashion with emphasis on violence.The violence in the attack sequence of Pearl Harbor is graphic in a very real sense and gives you a glimpse into what had happened during the attack. The Director's Cut is different from the theatrical cut that was seen in theaters. Graphic violence in which bodies and limbs are flying, bullets puncturing bodies with blood being something of a center-piece. From this, we get the prespective that Michael Bay wanted to show Pearl Harbor as it happened, however he misses the mark with some iffy writing from the first act and pure American justice (flaunted by some quick quips on friendship and American will power) in the final act before wrapping a dirty bow between the love triangle.Bottom line is. While the film misses many marks, it still makes up for being a prime piece of entertainment that only Michael Bay could have delivered. The mere problem is, he chose the film to be set in a real historical event in which real people died.-- Bonus Features --I've seen most of the bonus features that are listed in the Director's Cut. Most of which are cutted into segments in which we get a sense of how the film was made. From boot camp to filming, Pearl Harbor it appeared was a titanic undertaking that Michael Bay took. There isn't just one documentary that takes you from the inception of the film to the end of production as I've enjoyed with many of Ridley Scott's works on his films. But it's enough to show you how this film was made.-- In the End --If you're seeking a film to quench your thirst on a historical epic with authentic precision. You're looking at the wrong film. If you're seeking a film that entertains with such high caliber entertainment - then pick this up. However, please remember that this film and others who are historically based should do their homework prior to watching films such as Pearl Harbor.	4.0	Pearl Harbor -- Michael Bay's vision	2012-01-30	2	1	1

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ	"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius"""	I put off watching Pearl Harbor for some time, largely due to the dissatisfaction expressed by some viewers. Having now watched it, I have to say I was pretty much blown away by the movie. Certainly, this is no Tora! Tora! Tora! or any kind of definitive film about the events of December 7, 1941, and I think it is important to note the fact that it did not try to be such a film. The moviemakers tried to achieve a sense of realism but most of all they sought to recreate the experience of the event; no movie can even begin to show what the disaster was truly like to those involved, but Pearl Harbor comes as close as humanly and technologically possible. I don't really have any quibbles to make over historical accuracy because that is not a critical issue for me in this context. Certainly, the portrayal of certain characters is not necessarily correct, the main characters are not based on any real individuals, and a lot of the background story is not used to set the record straight on the unbelievably incompetent and, perhaps, treasonous decisions and actions that made our Pacific fleet a sitting duck to the Japanese attackers. In turn, very little of the Japanese side of the story is told. On the other hand, I was happy to see mentioned such things as the pre-attack interception of a Japanese sub entering the harbor and a recreation of Doolittle's Raid which gets far too little coverage in the history books.The love story bothers some people, but I understand what the moviemakers were trying to do in this regard: to make a story as poignant as possible, it has to be shown through the eyes of someone the audience can identify with and care about. The love story in this case is rather complex, but in my opinion it strengthened this movie's overall impact, at least on me. All of the actors were fantastic in my opinion, particularly Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett. Cuba Gooding, Jr., had a tremendous impact on the film through his rather small role as the true hero Dorie Miller. Seeing Alec Baldwin portray a military hero took some getting used to, but he was terrific as Lt. Col. Doolittle. Another unusual casting job that came off well was having Dan Aykroyd portray a high man in naval intelligence. I appreciate the fact that the filmmakers actively sought out Pearl Harbor survivors and tried to integrate many of their stories into this monumental film; while a certain thing may not have happened to a given character, that thing most likely happened to someone who was there. Seeing the nurses and doctors trying to save lives in the most hectic of circumstances was a poignant reminder that the fighting and suffering did not end suddenly when the Japanese pilots returned to their carriers.The special effects, I have to say, were amazing, among the best I have ever seen. The explosions are huge, the lifting up of the deck just before the Arizona exploded was quite impressive, the sight of Japanese planes zooming over Pearl Harbor just above ground level was breathtaking, the sight of bodies being literally thrown into the air as a result of explosions was incredible, and the listing and capsizing of the Oklahoma was downright amazing. I was eager to watch the making of Pearl Harbor featurette included with the DVD to see just how the visuals of this film could possibly have been created. That featurette also features sound clips from a number of Pearl Harbor survivors, and this helps make clear the intentions of the filmmakers to make the real heroes' stories an integral part of this motion picture. The History Channel program on The Unsung Heroes of Pearl Harbor was another fascinating video that is probably the most important thing included in this very impressive DVD package. Others may criticize the love story or dwell on historical inaccuracies, but I found this movie compellingly indicative of the Pearl Harbor experience and it was, for me, an honor to watch it.	5.0	There's nothing stronger than the heart of a volunteer	2003-05-30	3	1	2

I would definately recommend to see this film on the big screen just for this war scene. I never learned much about this tragedy, but just learned that it happened.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A23RV5FHKBPQD3	"""darkkave"""	For starters I saw this movie dubbed in Spanish so the corny lines and the bad acting that many other reviews mention are irrelevant to me.  Maybe if I watch it in english I'll change my review to match. Its definitely a typical Bruckheimer film.  Its just overdone in many ways, many of the films moments are just overdramatized which kind of made me laugh when the soundtrack suggested I should be all choked up.  The characters are stereotypical WWII characters carbon copied from previous WWII movies, I mean how many nurses named Betty were there in WWII, every movie about this subject seems to have one.  The love story was pretty lame but in a sense realistic, stuff like this actually happened and my grandfather told me a story about a friend of his during the war that was almost identical to this love triangle.  As far historical inaccuracies I don't see that many as much as simple lack of information, I mean there was more to the attack than just the US cutting the Japanese fuel supply, and they don't show how the official declaration of war was supposed to be presented before the attack and why it arrived half an hour too late, or why the Japanese Admiral decided not to send a third wave to mop up, or even how the aircraft carriers which were the main target were not present at the harbor.  Anyhow after all this I actually enjoyed the movie, the battles over the skies of Britain early on are my favorite, and the attack itself is great it its own way, rivaling that of Tora, Tora, Tora! and even though some of the special effects look fake, some are absolutely stunning, and the sound effects are also great.  The sound of bullets flying over your head and fighter engines really put you in the cockpit of the fighters. I guess the part about Doolitle's riders was either too long or too short.  They went into some detail but not nearly enough to make it rewarding.  I guess the producers seemed it was necessary to end the movie with an american victory because unhappy endings in summer blockbusters are no good. Overall I did enjoy the movie and would recommend it to anyone just looking to sit back and enjoy a movie, for its good parts and its bad parts.  If you're looking for historic accuracy watch a documentary.	3.0	Not as bad as I thought it would be	2001-07-19	2	1	1

Haase ""dothehucklebuck"""	Show-stopping special effects and production design cannot save this multi-million dollar turkey.  The love story triangle is boring, sentimental and insipid (just count how many times characters sigh at each other)and some of the lines are right out of WWII propaganda films of the 1940's (Alec Baldwin's pumped up speech to Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett about &quot;making America believe in victory&quot; takes the cake).Disney's Touchstone studios produced the film, which simplifies history to such an extent that the script could be read to 2nd graders.  Haven't we learned more about this event over the years?  I guess not, according to Hollywood.  &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; made in 1970 still takes the honors as the definitive Pearl Harbor film.  If you want more factual data, go to a National Geographic video program.  But if you want to be dumbed down to and assaulted by never-ending (albeit impressive) pyrotechnics, watch this film.Lastly, the only scene missing was Ben Affleck taking his adopted son to Disneyland at the end of the film.

Could the director of ""The Rock"" be trusted to do justice to such a pivotal moment in history?  Maybe, I thought, there's a real filmmaker in there and this is the chance he has been waiting for to do a different kind of movie.  Nope.  I got ... in by the hype and went to see this overlong, overblown soap opera of a film.  It gets a couple stars from me just because a lot of things blow up real good.  The love story is ridiculous.I was disturbed by the smug, triumphant tone the film took toward the vengeful bombing of Tokyo.  I'm not commenting on the morality of the action itself; that's a whole different discussion.  But now, more than fifty years after the war, I believe it should be depicted with more humility rather than as one of America's finest moments.  After all, tens of thousands of Japanese civilians died in that war for no other reason than that they lived in the cities that were bombed by the US.Finally, whenever a film based on a historical event is released, there are people who believe that they have actually learned something from the film and know more about the events depicted than they had before.  A lot of reviewers on this very page make such comments.  I would bet that virtually all of them have never read about Pearl Harbor.  In this day and age, everyone should be a little more media savvy.  Movies are NOT HISTORY!  They are ENTERTAINMENT!  None of you have learned ANYTHING from this film, with the possible exception of those who were not even aware that Japan ever attacked us.  I would venture to say that you probably know LESS about the event now than you did before since most of you don't have enough independent knowledge of WWII to evaluate the film' content to seperate what is true from what is false.."	2.0	Read a history book!	2001-07-21	12	6	6

That is not enough to make this a good movie. As was the case with &quot;The Titanic,&quot; this movie is as much a story about a romance as it is about the historic event it portrays. Quite frankly, much of the story line is predictable (ie, two best friends have a serious conflict over their common love interest) and the story line is extremely hokey. The greatest sin of this movie is that it drags on way too long. There was a way to end the story a half hour before the movie actually ends, but no, the screen writer ads on a whole additional story line that, although exciting, is too much already. I prefer an historical movie with less of a fictional story line, such as &quot;Tora Tora Tora.&quot; However, if there has to be a story, please, let it not be a totally silly romance!!!	3.0	I didn't like this movie	2001-12-16	3	2	1

Of course if you believe this movie, they only did it because we were levying an oil embargo on them.  There were no insights in this movie.  Bruckheimer, the real force behind this movie, didn't try to use his movie to make a political statement.  He simply made a mellodramatic, over-done, dizzying retelling of the events around the attack.  Then he slapped a generic title on it that doesn't accurately explain the subject of the movie.

It fails as a love story, it stinks as a buddy pic, and it's barely adequate as an action flic. The love story? Fit for 12-year-olds. Slow, emotionally stunted 12-year-olds. Everything else looks tacked on. The only reason to sit through Puerile Harbor is to see how many howlers you can catch. Here's a start -- (1) the hero leaves New York City for England on a train (2) he fails his eye exam AFTER two or more years as a pilot, having passed basic training, basic and advanced flight training, fighter training, etc. (3) as the battleship Oklahoma capsizes, it gets higher in the water, ending up upside down two feet ABOVE the water, before it smashes down on the sailors. My advice is to give it a miss and see Shrek instead. In comparison, THAT love story is credible, and the cartoon action is more believable.	1.0	Puerile Harbor	2001-05-29	7	5	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A103KNDW8GN92L	David Hugaert	&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is a film that should be judged for both its cinematic and realistic merits in that:For its cinematic merits, the main people involved with the making of this movie really went out of their way to create the utmost genuinely real visual effects, as far as the holocaust-like atmosphere is concerned. The viewer can really sense what it was like on that fateful December 7th, 1941 day, as if the viewer can feel the various troop members' pain through the realism of the flaming naval ships and helicopters, the battle scars, as well as the wounded bodies floating on the ocean's surface. Another thing that shouldn't be overlooked by the viewer are the Academy Award winning performances by Ben Affleck and Cuba Gooding, Jr., as they really put their heart and soul into their various character roles without trying too hard. Many kudos should also go to Dan Aykroyd as well, for his &quot;five-star&quot; portrayal as a strategic Naval captain (a Canadian all decked out in American military garb? Who'd a thunk it?). Aykroyd also demonstates here that he is more than up to the task of handling non-comedic, serious roles.CINEMATIC RATING: 4 STARSAs far as the realism of &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is concerned, it would definitely appear that Hollywood did not do its homework in ascertaining the actual real facts regarding what really happened on that December 7th day - instead relying on hearsay of media news coverage and the like. What could have been done is that the Hollywood screen writers should have relied on actual sources, such as referring to various history books on Pearl Harbor (although in spots, don't REALLY reveal the gist of the actual nature of the entire story) and by obtaining actual accounts of what happened by the actual survivors of this tragedy on both sides of the Japanese and American camps, assuming there are any survivors left. Furthermore, how does the viewer really know what happened as far as how the 1942 American retaliation of Japanese troops was played out as well, in spite of there possibly not being any aforetold mention of any doubtful history regarding Part 2 of the aftermath featured in this film, whatsoever? In concerning the actor portrayal of FDR in this film, the famous &quot;A Date In Infamy&quot; speech is verbalized 85% exactly, but seems somewhat forced and hurriedly spoken, especially when no brief pause occurs between the words &quot;in&quot; and &quot;infamy&quot;. I found some of the socialized scenes to be scripted, in that the writers didn't take the time to interview any of the survivors, thus ad-libbing the lines in the script. The main problem with the realism of &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is that this film was made ten years too late. Had the producers made this film during the 50th anniversary of the attack, there's a distinct possibility that more survivors could have given a more detiled and elaborate side of the story, since more of the people involved in this grave tragedy were alive back then. What's more, waiting to release this film on December 7th at the end of this year couldn't have hurt either, and would've gained a bigger fanfare as well as bigger bucks, which this picture is destined to do, anyway. Plus, the December 7th release would also have brought about greater media coverage concerning the military, not to mention pump even more HUGE dollars in Hawaii's tourism industry, primarily because of the U.S.S Arizona Memorial on Oahu. Since Hollywood already made this feature, the lack of realism cannot be erased nor changed. What a shame.REALISM RATING: 2 1/2 STARSJust because &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; lacks a substantial degree of realism does not make it a bad film, to say the least. To view this film in all its glory, is to simply watch it for its visual effects alone, as previously mentioned.

Wood	Pearl Harbor is a movie (DVD) that really takes the audience back to another era.  After reading many letters and accounts of this time period, I feel that the director and producer did an admirable job in transporting the viewer back in time.  People think that the love story is trite.  Well, they haven't read much about the &quot;lovers&quot; of this era.  Times were very different, and I think that the movie is very representative of the forties.  Also, the special effects only enhance the war scenes.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2KG8WLR1AKO12	"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator"""	"Most critics ridicule ""Pearl Harbor."" Also, the very fact that the film's producers and director Michael Bay relied extensively upon focus groups is disquieting to say the least. The only reason why I made a point of viewing ""Pearl Harbor"" is due to my interest in the treacherous Japanese attack on December 7, 1941. It turned out that this movie is perhaps one of the greatest of all time. Comparing ""Pearl harbor"" to the quickly made propaganda films of World War II is pure hogwash. ""Pearl Harbor"" is not only visually stunning, the cast which includes Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, Cuba Gooding Jr, Josh Harnett, Jon Voight, and most of all Alec Baldwin is near perfect. It is ironic that Baldwin who easily deserves an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of General Jimmy Dolittle will probably be denied this honor by his fellow political Hollywood Liberals. This may have been Baldwin's best work since ""Glengarry Glen Ross.""  The Liberal critics pretend that ""Pearl Harbor"" apes the historically dishonest ""The Patriot."" Nothing could be further from the truth. Mel Gibson's movie depicted the British as inhuman monsters. The reality is that American Revolution was a morally ambiguous war and both sides equally guilty of atrocities. It is even fair to argue that Great Britain lost the war due to its reluctance to commit war crimes. World War II, however, was a clear case of America being forced to fight the militaristically evil regimes of Japan and Germany. We were indeed the good guys, and our opponents vile and hateful. ""Pearl Harbor"" is fairly accurate and balanced. The only flaw that really stuck out is the film's refusal to have the actors smoking cigarettes. Regrettably most adults during that time period usually had a cigarette in their mouth when drinking alcoholic beverages in a convivial evening setting. Michael Bay thankfully made a point of adding a scene where a wounded American seaman curses a Japanese-American doctor who is coming to his aid. Racism is to be condemned regardless of the circumstances. Our nation's overall treatment of its loyal citizens of Japanese descent was shameful. We needed to be reminded of these injustices.The love triangle between the two pilots and the nurse is intelligently done. Liberal critics prefer anti-heroic movies. These cynics cannot even comprehend the fact that many Americans fought the Axis powers with extraordinary grace and bravery. ""Pearl Harbor"" deserves 5 stars. This is a film that you must see. It might even be your moral duty to do so."	5.0	Pearl Harbor is a Great Film--Ignore the Liberal Critics!	2001-05-26	28	15	13
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2JT6BO9PW4Q8O	David Traill	Historically, this may be better than Titanic, but not by much.  While I am pleased to see some of the stories of some of the things about World War II get introduced to a new couple of generations, I know that most of the things involving the lead characters is falsely portrayed and Hollywoodesque.  I did give my students a recommendation to see the movie so that I could use what they saw as a guideline, but I found myself often wishing that I hadn't due to the misperceptions and inaccuracies I saw historically.As entertainment, it may be, but I could not divorce myself from my feelings of annoyance knowing what I saw was not always the true story.	3.0	I liked it only for its action sequences	2001-12-12	0	0	0

The basic point of the movie was the same as Titanic. The makers were hoping to make the same billion dollars that the Titanic made World Wide. The love story is that the main character has a girlfriend and than supposibly gets shot down. While he is away his girlfriend gets pregnent to his best friend. Then he shows up alive and hates his best friend till the end of the movie were his best friend gets shot to death. Then he goes and marries his prevoius girlfriend.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A16B0CCH8PJ064	Debbee Horvath	I can easily say that Pearl Harbor is one of the best movies I've seen in along time. It starts out great,with Ben Affleck's and Josh Hartnetts characters as boys growing up in Tennessee, perfectly showing how innocent America was. Then it cuts to 1941,between getting in trouble in the Air Corps and romancing nurse Kate Beckinsale,Affleck goes to fight with the Brits against the Germans.After thinking he's dead( a great plot twist)Hartnett and Beckinsale fall in love.Director Michael Bay does a great job of intercutting this main story and showing how the Japanese were planning the attack,and Jon Voight (who gives his greatest performance) as president FDR, wanting to help the British, but keep America neutral. Bay also does a good job of showing what life was like Hawaii, before the attack, that reminded me of From Here to Eternity. The attack is masterfully recreated, unfortunetly its PG-13,so it couldn't be really graphic,there were some heartbreaking moments though, like the sailors who trapped in the ship, and when a bomb drops and blows up a soldier. The bombing raid at the end is excellently filmed and the ending is a bit sad. Overall Bay has created a film that I think is powerfull, and should not be forgotten like Thin Red Line.	5.0	The Best movie of the Summer!!!!!!	2001-07-25	11	7	4

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AOYTQFRLD8VLP	Deborah Earle	"Three decades after the events depicted in this story, part of my ""Air Force brathood"", as it were took me to the scene of the main area of drama for this movie. The older I get, the more unsettling it becomes to think of how such a beautiful place as Oahu looked during the early years of many of my early-life authority figures and neighbors...This 2001 feature provides us with a fictional love triangle against the backdrop of one of the most cataclysmic events in American History.It begins with two young Tennessee lads named Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker (Jesse James and Reiley McClendon), first pretending to fly in a makeshift  airplane as they wait for Rafe's crop duster father(Steve Rankin) to land his plane.Overtaken by a sense of adventure and mischief, the two boys sneak into the newly landed plane, accidentally starting it up and taking it a few feet before facing the wrath of Danny's father( William Fichtner), who was left a ""doddering wreck"" due to service in World War I.By the early 1940s, both young men( Ben Affleck, and Josh Hartnett) have channeled their love of flying into service in the military. While in a military clinic being tested for their abilities as pilots, Rafe encounters Nurse Lt. Evelyn  Johnson (Kate Beckinsale), a pilot's daughter  who, despite Rafe's dyslexia sympathetically allows him to pass, having seen firsthand what happens when pilots lose their wings. A romance ensues between the two.With Evelyn's co-workers in tow, they have an elegant evening out at a swank jazz joint in New York.These include the very young Betty Bayer (Jaime King), Barbara(Catherine Kellner), Sandra (a bobbed-haired and begoggled Jennifer Garner), and Martha(Sara Rue). The officers they encounter at that outing include Lieutenants Billy Thompson, Red Winkle, and Anthony Franco( William Lee Scott, Ewen Bremner, and Greg Zola).Rafe soon accepts assignment in Blitz-torn England, much to the dismay of Evelyn and Danny. Evelyn and the other nurses are soon transfered to sunny Hawaii. In watching those scenes, I can almost inhale the familiar fragrances of coconuts, pineapples, and plumerias. It was only during the last full year that I was there that I learned the historical significance of Pearl Harbor. But thanks to this film, I enjoyed a brief view of the Hickam water tower, behind which my siblings and I attended Hickam Elementary.We encounter the young Navy cook, Doris Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.) winning a boxing match and having his minor injuries treated by Evelyn, who is subsequently confronted with the news of Rafe's death in Europe by Danny. They share their grief with each other, and toast him with the other nurses. Parting company for sometime afterwards, a chance encounter draws them closer together.In the meantime, Commander Minori Genda( Cary-Hiroyuki Togawa), and Admiral  Isoroku Yamamoto(Mako) are fueling Japan's war machine( The parting rituals of the young pilots is intriguing to watch) while Admiral Kimmel(Colm Feore), Captain Thurman(Dan Aykroyd), Vice Admiral Fletcher(Thomas Arana), Secy. of the Navy Frank Knox( Tom Everett), try to stay a step ahead of them.On Saturday Evening, December 6, 1941, Evelyn receives a surprise visit from the very-much-alive Rafe, who had been trapped behind enemy lines after his plane went down and was unable to get word out until shortly beforehand. Realizing that Evelyn and Danny are now a couple, a devastated Rafe goes to a local watering hut for a drink. A brawl ensues when Danny confronts him there.Fleeing the scene before the police arrive, the two lifelong friends wonder how  their relationship will ever be the same.But soon larger events overshadow their dilemma...One major inaccuracy of this film is that the first bombs dropped by the Japanese would have hit land and not the water since most bases on Oahu are further northward and Pearl Harbor is in the South Central area of Oahu.But the film's dramatic presentation of the attack did enable me to view the Kohoolau Range,my one-time home of Hickam Air Force Base (then Hickam Field), and other childhood haunts.Until the battle begins and everything turns to twisted steel of iron gray, orange flames, and billowing, curling smoke, the view is lovely.A Navy Newsreel photographer(Pat Healy), jumps into Danny's car as Danny and Rafe, still casually dressed, try to get to an air field. Evelyn and the other nurses rush to the Army hospital.One accuracy of the film is its depiction of how doctors saved more lives in this war than the  previous one by focusing  on treating only those they knew they could save. But one young woman with a troubled past but promising future is sadly, among the casualties.Doris Miller swings into action after witnessing the death of Captain Mervyn Bennion(Peter Firth).He will become the first African American to earn the Navy Cross.Tom Sizemore's Sgt. Earl Sistern supplies the troops with weapons during the land battle, and soon Danny and Rafe take to the skies.President Roosevelt(Jon Voight) makes his famous declaration of war on Japan, and later inspires his staff with his can-do attitude, illustrating his point with his polio-plagued body. Lt.Col. James Doolittle(Alec Baldwin)recruits Rafe and Danny for his famous raid that will turn the tide in the war in the Pacific.For one of the two friends, it will bear fateful consequences. But a part of him will always remain with Evelyn and the true love of her life.Michael Shannon as Lt. Gooz Wood,Scott Wilson as Gen. George C. Marshall, and Graham Beckel as Admiral Nimitz are among the many supporting characters.The film is one of an occasionally forced sense of drama,but the cinematography is sharp, and to reiterate, seeing my beautiful Hawaii again is it its main redeeming quality."	3.0	Detailed Mediocrity, But Pleasant Memories of Childhood Stomping Ground	2009-11-11	4	2	2

It is such a sad place, and I was very moved by it.  The film was fantastic.  It was like an old fashioned love story although it had a lot of battle scenes.  I must admit that I cried during the whole movie, which is out of character for me.  I wish that the movie industry would make more films like this one.  We don't need nude scenes for a great movie.

The special effects that depicted the massive attack and destruction of Pearl Harbor were incredible. The beautiful and predictable love story was not typical during that time, but rather an indicative depiction of what many women and men went through during the turbulance of that war era. I would like to extend my feelings, even though my words have been said time and time again and seem inadequate, to thank and God Bless the American soldiers and American nurses who served and sacrificed their lives in the Pacific and European War Front and all the veterans of all wars including the soldiers who are presently serving,wherever they are today.

Towle	Pearl Harbor is a well done war drama honoring those men and women whose lives were taken by that horrific December 7, 1941 attack. The special effects were phenomenal and the love story, between the characters of Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett, was very believable; contrary to what other critic's feel. The gripe I have about the movie is that they showed 4 modern day destroyers(Spruance-Class) rigged together, and subsequently exploded, in the attack sequence. Now, as a former U.S. Navy sailor, I know that those destroyers did not even exist in 1941....they were commissioned in the late 70's early 80's. That part of the film disappointed me, somewhat, but didn't turn me away from liking the movie, overall. This is a great movie that really shows the human spirit from within the hearts of so many!

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2M0739LBWQQOI	"Dennis R. Meyer MD ""Kahuna914"""	This is a fun Disney movie with something for everybody except the person who wants to learn something about what happened on December 7, 1941.There's romance with a lovely heroine and two hunky heroes, one of whom must die. because this IS Disney after all (remember Old Yeller???).  There are enough special effects to make George Lucas re-think Star Wars Episode I. There is an excellent surreralistic hospital scene with gore enough to satisfy the most blood-thirsty Gothic fan. There are even arch villains, complete with Sub-titles, a nod to the &quot;art movie&quot; crowd.But there is no history. The same guys that wrote General Custer's history in &quot;They Died with Their Boots On&quot; and turned Erroll Flynn into George Armstrong Custer were at work on this movie's script.My only fear is that people who have no clue about what actually happened on the &quot;day that will live in infamy&quot; will think that FDR looked like Jon Voigt;  that Dan Akroyd was loose in the basement of the old Navy building (where is John Belushi when you REALLY NEED HIM???); and that there were unpatriotic Japanese living in Honolulu who actually spied on Pearl Harbor (the Nisei 442nd Regimental Combat Team of the 100th Batallion, made up mostly of Hawaiian Americans of Japanese ancestry,  was the most decorated American army unit in history)!!Enjoy the movie for what it is: a glitzy,computer generated offering on the altar of High Technology, mixed with a 1940's style romance.  Help Disney recoup it's $245 million price tag, complete with advertising costs.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AXMPBUWHJGHGO	Desperado	THis movie is basically tooo long to watch and the plot has nothing to do with the attack on Pearl Harbor.Although the attack scenes were well executed. Neverless the film was plagued with a very flawed script and stereotypical charactors.The good parts of the movie is the production value and the attack sequences. Plus Jon Voight did a good job as the President. Plus a lot of good actors such as Cuba Gooding Jr and Tom Sizmore, Dan Akroyed and Alec Baldwin made cameo appearences.But the draw back of the film is the script. Too many movies have love triangle plots and this movie is too long on that part. Also some charactors were stereotypical (especially the Japanese)Plus the editors did a bad job especially in the first part (pre December 7th). it is too longThis film also had historical inaccuracies. One of the most notable ones was that of Yamamoto. He did not go with the fleet. He stayed behind in Japan and sent his Vice Admiral (Nagumo) to carry out the attack. Also according to Japan, they attacked on December 8th (they are about a day ahead of us) but the movie showed their calandar December 7th.Overall the film is good. If you do not like love triangles I suggest you watch somthing else but if you can tolerate it then be my guess.(here is a tip for you DVD owners. Skip a few scenes of the first part of the movie until the attack then watch the remaing part of the movie in full.Hope you enjoy it.	3.0	Not Good, Not Bad...........	2001-12-13	1	1	0

The effects were amazing, the bombing of the Harbor was a longer scene then I thought it would be and it was brilliant.  Had a few &quot;Titanic&quot; like qualities such as the scene with Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale amongst the parachutes and Kate with Ben Affleck on the side of the ship.  It was a 3 hour flick, which I did not look at my watch once and I am a notorious clock counter.  I thought the development of the relationships early in the movie was important because we could really feel for the characters and underdevelopment is a problem in many movies.  I also felt the movie was very &quot;PC&quot; and very kind in their portrayal of the Japanese (any coincidence to the fact that Titanic raked up a fortune in Japan, hmm).  Anyway a film that is worth the money and the sound and the graphics make it a must see in the theatres.	4.0	My thoughts	2001-05-25	25	17	8
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AF4JT7A4AHWYK	"D. Finn ""enderone"""	For all the movie bashing going on over Pearl Harbor. I think many people are missing the point. Sure the movie is trite in many ways, and glosses over or outright rewrites the actual historical events to fit the story flow.  For history buff this is a criminal violation. For the rest, well.... Tora, Tora, Tora was a masterful historical portrayal, and look how well that did (originally)!What was done right here was that the movie is steeped in the feel of the period it was portraying. From popular visuals of the time (train steam obscuring view, spinning couple embracing), to the very story that seems to be ripped from a typical 50's love story flick (granted not one of the classics of the time, just one of the stereotypical ones). The movie drew from me the found memories of watching the old movies that my grandparents used to force me to sit through on TV (and still from time to time watch to this day).The action parts of the movie also did a great job of capitalizing on the high tech realism that made Saving Private Ryan such a hit. Sure, the Pearl Harbor movie massacres the history aspects of the event, but if you watch Tora Tora Tora right after you appreciate it more. Tora failed to grab viewers with any real story, Pearl may be trite but if you let your expectations go it can be somewhat enjoyable. The battle scenes also complement a Tora viewing. Overall, worth the money spent for admission!Some historical notes. Two pilots did shoot down seven (7) planes at Pearl. If you watch Tora Tora you'll see that Pearl Harbor handles that portion of the story fairly well. Until they get into the air that is, the real pilots got into the air after the attack wave passed. They picked off the zeros and the slower moving bombers from behind! No head to head action like Pearl. Tora even flashes Cuba Goodings historical character. The fictionalized accounts in some ways makes reviewing Tora more enjoyable. Though I doubt either of the pilots of Pearl ever served with the RAF or flew on Doolittle Raid (I'm certain of the latter). I'm surprised neither movie really gets into the previous victories of the Japanese with similar tactics (i.e. against Russia), though Tora does make a very vague reference to it.	4.0	Enjoy it for what it is	2001-06-17	1	0	1

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A35MYCC2A7JCU7	Dianna Lipp Rivers	As a former Army nurse once stationed at a hospital near Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, I find the movie &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001), directed by Michael Bay, to be one of the best films depicting the lives of American nurses during war. The Navy Nurses in this World War II movie are seen not only as professional persons carrying out technical skills with compassion and expertise, but also as complete persons with their lives deeply affected by the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor and the ensuing war. Throughout the movie there are glimpses of nurses performing their many responsibilities. The nurses' lives during and before the war are realistically depicted. During the pre-war times, the nurses in New York are conducting aspects of the physical exam. Once in Honolulu at the military hospital, you find them on a quiet nursing unit. With the bombing of Pearl Harbor on the main island of Oahu, the nurses are mobilized into setting up emergency surgery and one of the very first emergency triage areas. The beautiful, caring and dedicated nurse heroine, portrayed extremely well by Kate Beckinsale, uses her lipstick to triage the critically ill and those too badly wounded to be saved. The nurses are depicted as skilled, brave, professional and intelligent. Beckinsale's character saves the life of a major with her finger by pressing a bleeding artery during the bombing, and because of this heroism is able to obtain information about the two men she loves who are engaged in the Doolittle Raid in Japan. No one is spared from the ravages of war. One of the nurses is killed during the bombing. As the Japanese admiral stated early in the movie, a brilliant man figures out how to resolve conflicts without a horrible war killing so many.	5.0	Navy Nurses and Pearl Harbor	2003-01-12	7	5	2

How can you not see how blatantly horrible this movie is?? Me giving this movie 2 stars is being VERY kind.There's so much wrong with this movie I don't know where to start!Maybe I'll start with the cliched love triangle. Or how predictible this movie is?This movie could have been so much better if, put a bit more focus on the Japanese, and the planning of the attack. It could have been better if the love story didn't take up half the movie. It could have been better if the focus of the movie was actually the attack on Pearl Harbor, as opposed to the stupid love story. It could have been better if the people in the movie actually acted at their full potential.The worst part about this movie was how they made the Americans look godly. I read another review someone wrote here, it involved the part where the British guy said ""if the rest of them back home are as good as you...then I welcome them to the war"" and he said he could detect a bit of patriotism. What I detected was Americans making themselves look like they were the only making an impact against the Nazis, which is simply not true.This movie could have been over, right after the attack on Pearl Harbor...But no...They can't stand going out on a losing note so they go into the whole Dolittle operation. In this scene, we find Alec Baldwin giving one of the cheesiest, most poorly acted speeches I have ever seen, my sister was in hysterics while he was giving his speech.So much more wrong with this movie...but I only have a thousand words :)"	2.0	3 1/2 stars??

The only thing that this had going for it was certain perspectives of photography (i.e. backend of a Japanese torpedo) - (Japanese zeros used breakaway wooden fins on their torpedos for the shallow Pearl's water and stability guidance) and some niceties of Japanese and American diplomatic/military historical commemtaries. But also this photography - with all it's tech - gives the overall picture too livid and vivid scenario for the 1940's 'feel'. The battle sequences are the only real overall worth, but only by perspective (sailors hanging on to a battleship at near rollover).The love triangle is dated, but it maybe the way of it for young servicemen then. Mild chuckles here.This critique applies to only the movie and not 'Unsung Heroes' - which has better real value.	3.0	split the rental	2001-12-12	0	0	0

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1ONTISSIWC1EX	"""dkrehnbrink"""	Didn't know what to think about this movie going in.  I figured it had something for everyone - some epic romance for the ladies and some action for the fellas.  And I figured that all Americans, young and old, male and female, should appreciate it for its historical message.  Reconciling all of these elements in one flick was a challenge that I wasn't sure could be accomplished.  But Pearl Harbor pulled it off with aplomb.  Sure, there were some historical liberties taken, but I have the History Channel and countless books to steer me straight in that regard.  After all, the true story of Dec 7 1941 wasn't about tactics and strategy and heroism - we simply got our butts kicked.  There were few heroes - mostly just survivors and martyrs.  The heroes came later.  The real story of the attack was about the impact it had on the psyche of all Americans - perhaps no other event in the history of this great country so quickly unified our people and mobilized the populace to action.  In that sense, I don't think the movie could have been historically significant or effective without some human emotional element.  Truthfully, I enjoyed the drama of the movie as well and this is a big concession from someone who who only went to see the bombing scenes.  Besides, Kate Beckinsale is hot in a pasty white English girl next door kinda way.  Go see it.  Also, take your kids to see it - nobody gets naked and it isn't as gory as, say, Saving Pvt Ryan; our youth should know why their grandfathers fought (and died) in the war lest we forget.	4.0	Pleasantly surpised	2001-05-27	6	3	3

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2198FZZMTJ38H	D. Litton	Upon exiting the theater after &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; I was set upon by a man who referred to the American officials portrayed in the film as &quot;bumbling idiots.&quot; It's a good thing he said &quot;Americans,&quot; because he easily could've been speaking about Rafe, Danny and Evelyn, the trio involved in a love triangle plot that is one of the movie's pitfalls. The sequence of the attack itself is magnificent, but is bookended by the development of the sappy love story and the American attack on Japan. It's not a good sign when, forty minutes into the movie, you find yourself favoring the trailer over the actual movie.Beginning a movie with character development is a good thing, but only if you know how to iron it out. The film opens in Tennessee, with childhood friends Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) playing pilots in a barn. Moving along a couple of years, they are pilots in the United States armed forces, and like most pilots do, they spend their leave chasing nurses, who are just as man-hungry as the cadets.To make a long and tedious story short, Rafe meets Evelyn, falls in love with her, and is called away to duty in Britain. Circumstances intervene, and Rafe returns to find that Danny and Evelyn are now lovers, casting the whole relationship into strife just in time for the bombing of Pearl Harbor by Japanese air forces.The movie tries unsuccessfully to balance the love story with historical facts and events. Every now and then, we leave their happy lives together to venture to the United States War Department, where Captain Thurman (Dan Aykroyd) and President Roosevelt serve little purpose except to foreshadow the impending attack that we already know is imminent (the title, duh!). We're also given a dosage of Japanese movements, from their planning of the bombing to Japanese naval craft and planes making their way to Hawaii. If we had more of this kind of material, the movie just might work.But instead, it loses focus from the real story behind Pearl Harbor, settling for the love story in hopes of bringing out some sort of human drama to bring out our emotions for the tragedy as a whole. This brings out the ever-present &quot;Titanic&quot; machinations, as it also included fiction with history. Now, I cannot begin to criticize the historical aspect of the film; I know too little about the whole sequence of events to make a comparison. But what I can tell you is that &quot;Titanic&quot; was able to provide us with likeable, involving characters amidst a very accurate historical setting.For some reason, the same formula applied here fails. We can't really care for Evelyn, Danny and Rafe because of the story they are given. There's too many romance clich&eacute;s which bury the characters in a mess of break-ups and budding romance similar to the switches that an everyday, stereotypical teenage girl would make. Maybe that's an audience-targeting tactic, or just an honest mistake. Either way, the love story does nothing but add on the baggage, filling the cracks with sappy one-liners and unconvincing dialogue.And the movie's turn of events after the actual bombing itself is ludicrous and draggy. It makes Rafe and Danny out to be heroes known among all, hoping to instill some air of patriotism alongside flag wavers and cheers from the men in the water as they successfully down two Japanese fighter planes. Soon after, they must leave on a mission to Tokyo, where they set out to perform a counterstrike against the Japanese. At one point, one of the characters (I think it was Doolittle, played by Alec Baldwin), makes the statement that the mission is &quot;to avenge Pearl Harbor.&quot; Obviously an attempt to connect this action with the previous sequences, but no such luck. It goes on for too long, and wouldn't you know it, there has to be more of the love story involved as well.Which brings me to my discussion of the actual attack portion of the movie. This is the section to see, if you are willing to stick it out until then. The intensity really does reach a high note as the planes begin descending on Hawaii, and although we know what will happen, it's quite exciting and moving to watch it all unfold onscreen. The bombing of the ships does not happen too fast, but gets it just right by taking its time in showing us the panic in and out of the ships in the bay. Another high point is the events that take place in the hospital ward, where thousands of wounded soldiers begins appearing. The movie does well with this entire sequence, not only because of some spectacular special effects, but because the love story characters are left alone to perform their real duties, leaving behind the sap and giving us a real taste of human drama.In summation, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; does not live up to the hype surrounding it. The human drama and excitement of the attack on American forces is drowned by the love story, which never reaches a level of reality, while the ending flatlines completely. I had many questions at the end of the movie: is this really the work of Randall Wallace, who also wrote the magnificent &quot;Braveheart?&quot; Do the filmmakers think that by ignoring the actual focus of the story, it will become more involving? I have one thing to say about the movie: the trailer is better.	2.0	Five stars for the attack, two stars for the love story.	2001-05-31	2	1	1

When watching this film, it is painfully obvious that the makers of this film were using James Cameron's ""Titanic"" as a guide.  They should have paid more attention to their own production.  This love triangle simply belongs elsewhere.  Every good critic knows that it is what made ""Titanic"" an outstanding emotional picture.  World War 2 and romance simply do not mix.  The attack scene is undeniably spectacular, despite the fact that it becomes tiresome as it progresses.  If only Michael Bay could have used Spielberg's ""Private Ryan"" technique, I could be giving this film 5 stars."	2.0	Wasted opportunity	2002-04-13	1	1	0

Cote ""Flight19"""	For months in advance of my seeing this movie, all I heard was negative this...negative that.  Well, I can tell you one thing, this movie isn't all that bad.  What I find more objectionable are all the armchair critics - many of which have showered us with their &quot;knowledge&quot; of movie making below - who, for whatever reason, have an axe to grind against this movie.  Look, get a grip!  If you wanted a documentary, why are you going to the theater?  That's never been Hollyweird's strength.  The fact is they spin fantasy better than anything else, with occasional references to historical fact.This movie has reasonable tempo, excellent special effects and a very nicely woven story line (if loose with the facts of history).  For those that think the love story is old hat, well all I can say is - if you want an original love story, write it yourself!  The easiest job on the planet is that of the critic, and God knows we're replete with critics.  I liked the way this movie tied together historical events, even if the portrayal of those events wasn't true to form.  Hey, The Longest Day - long considered the definitive D-Day movie is hardly factually accurate.  But, it's still a good movie.  Saving Private Ryan is likewise loose with the facts - but generally speaking - the movie's goal was to convey the sense of what it was like to be there.  It, like Pearl Harbor, ties many smaller stories that occurred on that day in history together so that the movie and it's characters have cohesion.  You can't accomplish that jumping all over the place telling 3000 separate stories that occurred on a single day.  You do it by funneling all of those facinating little stories into a small group of characters and you view &quot;history&quot; from that perspective.  Anyone that expects, or thinks that Hollywood should start spinning out documentaries has a very slippery grip on reality's already frayed rope.If you want the facts, seek out and talk at length with WWII vets.  Many of those that I've approached are reluctant at first, but when I express my undying gratitude for their tremendous sacrifices, they usually return the favor by sharing bits and pieces of their experience.  Many vets that refused in the past to talk about the horrors of that war are now speaking out - I think to make sure people don't forget how bad things can get - before they all move on to reunite with their fallen comrades.This movie is better than most of the &quot;critics&quot; are telling you.  If you doubt me, go see it, then come back and tell me I'm wrong!	4.0	Lighten Up!	2001-12-31	3	2	1

This is exactly what it delivers.. though differently than I expected.  The story itself is typically cliche (you really can't believe some of the terribly cliched lines they pull out in this film) and sappy, but is pretty well interleaved with the development of the attack on Perl Harbor.The attack itself really is worth seeing - the special effects are just amazing.  While I'm sure it isn't true to history (were you really expecting Hollywood to be true to history anyway?), seeing the attack in color and from different perspectives is just amazing.Go enjoy the special effects... maybe enjoy the story... take the whole thing with a grain of salt... it isn't a documentary.. :)	3.0	Worth seeing for the special effects	2001-05-27	1	1	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A32VRF08ZAVP1E	"Douglas W. Peschka ""Doug Peschka"""	"On 7 December 1941, Japanese naval aircraft launched a devastating attack against the U.S. Naval Fleet at Pearl Harbor, killing over 2,400 sailors, soldiers, and airmen.This attack shocked a complacent and isolationist America into action, and the real truth is that only over time did this nation recover from that attack and fight through hard years of combat to win the war and bring it to an end.The story of Rafe and Danny, and their accidentally-shared relationship with Evelyn, is an honestly emotional story, told well against the backdrop of, and deeply affected by, the onset of the war.  This, I feel, the movie does well.This reviewer's problem is with this ""Pearl Harbor's"" historical inaccuracies.""Before the Doolittle Raid, America knew only defeat, after it, only Victory.""  No, not quite.The Doolittle Raid on Tokyo did NOT turn the tide of the war, as Kate Beckinsale's voice-over at the end of ""Pearl Harbor"" claimed. Instead, America continued to face many other other setbacks in the war after the December 7th attack, and it was not until the terrible and bloody battle at Midway - which happened some time after the Doolittle raid - that the fortunes of the war were reversed in the Pacific to America's favor.According to this movie, however, something more important than that was the love triangle story going on between Ben and Kate and Josh. Now, don't get me wrong - during wars, men who were presumed dead in combat probably have returned home to find that, in their absence, when they were presumed dead, their wives had re-married and gone on with their lives. IF things like this happen in real life during war, then it's one of the many sad costs of war. I grant that.But, let's be honest - If you see that a film called ""Pearl Harbor"" is about to be released, what do YOU expect?While ""Pearl Harbor"" placed a heartbreaking and honestly emotional lover's-triangle story in front of the attack on Pearl Harbor, it gave us a very fictionalized visualization of the attack itself. I was in the Navy and stationed at Pearl Harbor in the early 1970s, when Knox-Class escort ships were in service, and the then-new Spruance-Class destroyers were just coming off the drawing boards, and Ticonderoga-Class Missile Frigates were brand-new warships in the 1970s, a full 30 years AFTER the attack on Pearl Harbor. These obviously 1970-vintage ships stick out like a sore thumb all over the ""Pearl Harbor"" attack scenes. [There were a few glimpses of these types of vessels in ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"", but in that superior film, this error was mercifully minimized.]The use of 1970s-built ships for a film about events in 1941 just does not fly.The Battleship USS Nevada was the only armored battleship int eh harbor to get under way during that attack.  Her sortie is a major part of the story of the Pearl harbor attack.  It is not in this movie at all.If all that money can be spent on CGI re-creations of ships like the USS Arizona and her destruction, then it could and should have also been used to make sure that every ship we saw in film was a ship built prior to 1941.Imagine a film set during the American Civil War of the 1860s with Model Ts chugging around in the background.  You KNOW they will not be invented until forty years later in the early 1900s.  Do YOU think that would be good filmmaking?Add to that the images ""Pearl Harbor"" gives us of 1941 Japanese planes that seemed to be able to out-fly today's jet aircraft. Jerry Bruckheimer brought a little too much ""Top Gun"" to the flight scenes of this film.If you want a well-told accidental love triangle played by attractive young actors in front of a film about the attack that brought America into World War Two, and you are willing to risk missing the truth about one of the most tragic events of the 20th Century, which changed the course of history, and re-shaped the world that you and I wake up in every morning, then ""Pearl Harbor"" is for you.Also, if you want to see a romance played out against the time and place of the days leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor, you might also like ""From Here To Eternity"".  That film may be old, but it's a good one.And finally, I will say what so many other people who honor the memory of ourbrave armed service men and women who have fallen in battle have said:For the ultimate movie about the real events leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor,and the attack itself, buy the widescreen edition of ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"".THAT movie gets the real story right.Doug Peschka,U.S. Navy Veteran"	3.0	Where are the Pearls in THIS Harbor?!	2005-12-30	3	2	1

I remember the Sunday in which the news on radio broke through the typical fare of football and, I remember the voice of FDR in the Congress asking for the declaration of War (a device we have not used in the more than 70 years since). Watching the last scenes of the film, Jimmy Doolittle's Raid, reminds me of the day in 1944 or 1945, when I took my 'kid' sister to one of NYC's Movie Palaces, The Roxy, to see ""Purple Heart"", on screen (and, on stage, Louis Armstrong and the band he fronted in the 30's and early 40's and Ella Fitzgerald, still in the first decade of her long career.). Purple Heart was a film that fit the bill perfectly for a nation which was striving for victory in two wars, part of the greatest military conflagration in World History (to this date). It told (the fictional) story of some of Doolittle's fliers being tried before a Japanese count.So, I do agree that the love story is dispensable, that there was an absence of the kind of  star power, that Spencer Tracy, Robert Montgomery, John Wayne, Robert Taylor, and many others, lent to films of the war during the war. Still and all, the film struck a chord and revitalized never forgotten memories. That was a war in which  more of our people died than in the several wars since combined. The War in which the fathers (and some of the mothers) of the Baby Boom generation fought or waited desperately at home hoping never to get that telegram from the Government telling them of a death in the family. The War in which the United States was forced to become The Power in the World, a role for which it had so little taste.Now I can't disentangle the reality from the memory nor treat this film as if it was my only experience of the story it tells. About all I can say is that it did serve to tap those memories and provide viewer satisfaction in seeing the story told once again for a younger generation."	4.0	Remember Pearl Harbor!	2012-04-05	4	3	1

The planes were fast, the bullets were plentiful, and the explosions were loud.&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; tells the emotional story of December 7th, 1941, and the events that led up to and followed it, mainly from the point-of-view of Rafe and Danny, two friends that were stationed at Pearl. The attack scene was incredible, the effects were awesome. It felt like I was there. They showed everything, from the Zeros flying in, making their approach, to the deathly quiet burning debris after the attack. The whole attack scene must have been about 1 hour.While the movie was excellent, there was an excessive, over-the-top love saga, if you will, that I believe the movie could have really done without. It took the focus off the main subject of the movie, which was Pearl Harbor if any of you couldn't figure that out. I suppose this love story was an attempt by Hollywood to turn a bloody war movie partially into a chick-flick so everyone could enjoy it.	4.0	Good movie...

Why they felt the need to include Dolittle's raid is beyond me. I guess so it didn't end on a downer. We know who won the war, you don't have to put it in the freakin' movie.Still, great action scenes. Too bad it is physically painful to watch up until that point. Again, if you are a 13-year-old girl, by all means watch it, you will love it. If not, borrow a friend's DVD and just watch the action scenes.	1.0	overblown, overacted, overlong	2002-05-09	4	1	3
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A43TV4W6F5SA	Duoo	At first after hearing all the hype about this film I thought that it would just pan out as a typical pre-summer movie, I was wrong. What made it special for me was that I viewed it along side Japanese viewers. So it was pretty interesting viewing what was going on on screen and watching what was happening to the audience. I even saw a row of old men around their 60's watching...crying actually during the raid scenes. I wasn't sure how to react but that made it memorable for me. The movie made my summer, I won't even bore you with the details because if you haven't seen it and you're planning to buy the DVD,(preferably the one coming out this January 2002) Go ahead and pay-away, it's worth adding to your collection. I'm definitely getting my copy.	4.0	The movie gleam for 2001	2001-08-28	4	2	2

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3KDGJX43RU5MK	D. W. MacKenzie	This movie does a great job of showing what happened at Pearl Harbor in December 41. It has all the dirt on these two pilots and this nurse. One of the pilots was foolin around with the nurse, then she thought he was dead and hooked up with another pilot- a friend of the dead one. Then it turns out that the other pilot wasn't really dead!!! You find out all about who was sleeping with whom in this film! Unfortunately, they break up this history lesson with something about an attack and a war.The Producers of this film messed up with excellent special effects in the attack scene. This draws attention from the main story line- the pilot/pilot/nurse triangle. Instead of wasting the audiences time with this silly war thing, they should have focused on digging up more dirt on the main characters.Seriously, this film is absurd to the point of being insulting. I do not need a bunch of melodramatic garbage to sit through a movie on such an important event. This film could have been a remake of Tora, Tora, Tora- with better effects and less wooden acting. Instead, it was more like a remake of the 'Pearl' miniseries with Dennis Weaver and Angie Dickinson- with better effects and overacting by the main characters.The real events of December 7th are enough for an interesting movie. Fictional dirt about who was sleeping with who insults the audience by assuming that this is necessary to maintain its' attention. It also disrespects the memory of those men who fought, on both sides, in this first of WWII battles involving the US. They should sell this video with instructions on fast forwarding to the actual attack. The special effects are quite good, though they go overboard on the blood and gore.	1.0	Hollywood History	2003-07-25	34	25	9

First off, there are two good things:  1) the battle scenes are beautiful, and 2) the part played by Cuba gooding is historically acurate (check it out, he won the Navy Cross!).  Now beyond that, this movie is a love story.  Yes, its a love story that makes Titanic's look good and interesting.  Two friends, one woman, a mistaken death, then he returns to mess it all up.  My God, Soap Operas do better than this!  Ben Affleck, while cool and likeable, plays this part like he does all of his parts.  You can't tell if he is from 1942 or 2002.If you're looking for a good war movie, this is NOT it.  Go see the Thin Red Line, Von Ryan's Express (Frank Sinatra in a WWII POW movie) anything but this.  If you want to see a good Pearl Harbor movie go buy Tora!Tora!Tora!  That movie is acurate and doesn't have the sappy, horrid love story in this movie.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1FG3A3V5IAEG9	"E. Frampton ""Parandot"""	First of all, Pearl Harbor is a good movie.  I thought it was a tribute to the &quot;Greatest Generation.&quot;  The Pearl Harbor battle scene is the best war scene ever.  It bests the Saving Private Ryan D-Day by a wide margin, also when the R-rated version comes out next fall, it will leave no doubt as to the absolutely astounding quality of the battle scenes.  The love triangle is a tad overwrought, but so what, it is adequate, just like Titanic was adequate.  The atmosphere created by the filmmakers greatly overshadows the inadequacies of the plot.  You could spend all day pointing out little historical discrepencies in every war film, Saving Private Ryan involved a mission that never happened, I won't name others.  Basically, Pearl Harbor was a movie that got canned by critics who love their films pretentious and self-serving aka Waking Life or Memento.  Anyway, it's entertaining and it does justice to the Pearl Harbor attack, not much else can be said.	4.0	You should really stop reviewing this as a documentary	2001-12-22	6	3	3

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A8KWKXQDA9IN7	"E. Kim ""A great man should die as a shattered..."	"Once again Michael Bay proves his lack of originality, following fellow Hollywood Action director James Cameron's footsteps and changing the pace from overrated, hype-driven action movies to make a sappy, over-budgeted, under-written, historical epic love drama.  This is truely a terrible film.  I guess you can't really call it ""historical"" since Bay addded plenty of ""Hollywood"" effects to the shocking surprise bombing of Pearl Harbor.  Let's face it, this movie was not intended to be a ""war"" movie, the intention was to be a love drama.  But it failed terribly at achieving even that.  The love triangle drama was very unbelievable and ""corny.""  Maybe the bad acting had something to with it, but it was not at all believable.  I cannot express how angry this film makes me.  It is a perfect example of what a ... movie is.  Bad directing, bad acting, a bad script, just overall bad.  I watched this with a group of friends and didn't really have a choice in what I was doing.  Don't make the same mistake as I did, don't waste precious hours of your important life, DEFINATELY don't spend money to buy this.  In all honesty, I HATE Hollywood movies, but if you're going to watch a war-related Hollywood drama, watch something like ""Saving Private Ryan.""  But if you want to watch some REAL war movies, watch Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" and Francis Ford Coppela's ""Apocalypse Now."""	1.0	One of the worst movies ever made...	2002-06-15	11	7	4
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1G6KQ2HSX483I	"Elaine ""chi_girl"""	My reaction after seeing the film? Well, I was totally unimpressed. While it held my attention, I never got involved with the characters and never &quot;felt&quot; for them. Even during the scenes when Pearl Harbor was being attacked, I never once felt any emotion for anybody. It reminded me very much of the old films from the 40's and 50's which depicted the bombing taking place and that was supposed to be enough. The actors were simply going through the motions here and you knew it. (Though I've never thought much of Ben Affleck as an actor anyway. I can't name anything I've seen that he's been really great in. Josh Hartnett did a much better job here in my opinion.) You knew they were just acting instead of getting attached to the characters and somehow &quot;believing in your mind&quot; that this was actually happening before you. There were some scenes which were such a direct rip-off of Titanic that I almost expected someone to shout &quot;I'm King of the World!&quot; at any moment. I never connected with the love story part of this movie either, though it worked into the plot. I just never bought the fact that anyone was really in love. Maybe there was just too much in this movie. I feel they should have concentrated on the friendship between Affleck and Hartnett (which was the only part I felt really worked and was believable) and the events at Pearl Harbor more. After the attack, you see hardly anything of the aftermath which I think would have been much more interesting than the love story part which didn't excite me at all. (The movie IS titled Pearl Harbor!!!) After all we've found out since Pearl Harbor took place, this one wasn't even historically correct. You think they'd have at least gotten that part right. So, my opinion is that it was a decent film that no one will hate, (if you get all giddy over explosions and loud noises you might really like it) but it wasn't anything to get all excited about either. Worth the cash if you have 3 hours to spend and don't know what to do with it, but hardly worth going out of your way to see.	3.0	Bombing Pearl Harbor	2001-09-04	0	0	0

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AYG1U47VFZ165	"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)"""	It's hard to imagine anyone chocking more material about the making of a major motion picture onto a series of discs (this has 3 separate commentary tracks for review, and they're all worthy of the time).It's also hard to imagine how this cut -- the director's version -- was hacked down to what was shown theatrically.  Granted, not everything brought back to life was absolutely necessary to advance the story, and there are still some great ... um ... er ... interpretations of what happened throughout the Doolittle Raid.  Alec Baldwin, despite a handful of additional screen time, is still unconvincing as the legendary Jimmy Doolittle, but (thankfully) Dan Ackroyd's and Jon Voigt's additional screen time are welcome additions.  There's certainly more tension in the build-up toward the attack, and there's a wealth of additional battle scenes (one of them nearly entirely reconstructed to bring out a different focus) that make the discs worth the investment.While PEARL was dealt a fairly critical lashing for its self-indulgence, Director Michael Bay takes a baby step toward redemption in this Vista Series addition, but what still misses the mark is the love triangle.  Like a bad 60's love story, it just didn't compute.  Perhaps if the script had provided more substance to Kate Beckingsale's character or a stronger motivation for her falling so easily into Danny (Josh Hartnett) for comfort, the situation might not have seemed so forced, so engineered.But, despite its flaws, a restored PEARL is a wonderfully crafted World War II epic whose newly envisioned battle sequences (much of the footage reinserted into this cut) compete artistically with those from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN in at least the &quot;emotional aftershock department.&quot;... and the extras.Wow.Hours and hours and hours to go.	4.0	&quot;A Disc That Will Live In Infamy ...&quot;	2002-07-05	2	2	0

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2TDUV7QTMFWFP	Elizabeth	The main problem with this movie, as I see it, is that it drags on and on---especially the &quot;love story&quot; at the beginning of the movie.  I think the writers could have shortened it and get the point across at the same time.When the attack occurs----well, that is a true masterpiece.  Not only did the director manage to capture the total destruction at Pearl Harbor, but the human loss was made quite clear.  One scene in particular has stuck with me--after the attack was over, people began to try and rescue some of those trapped--some soldiers are trying to free their fellow soldiers from being drowned and all they could do was hold their hands as they died.  That scene alone, for me, conveyed the devestation of human loss at Pearl Harbor.I also liked Cuba Gooding Jr. in this movie...Mister &quot;Show me the money&quot; proves he can go way beyond a comedy and into some serious drama.  Hopefully, he will get more roles like this one.The only character that got on my nerves a bit was Alec Baldwin's.  We get the message, Mr. Baldwin, you're supposed to be a tough guy!  Sheesh...talk about over acting.Aside from Mr. Baldwin's performance, and the length of the movie, I would recommend that you purchase this film.	4.0	Could have been a bit shorter....	2002-03-14	1	0	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A87C6ICDWYJQQ	Ellis Fowler	"The only thing that saves this movie from being a complete waste of time is the attack itself. That entire sequence is harrowing and a very tough watch. Kudos to the Special Effects people. It was as if history came alive. However, the tremendous carnage and bloodshed displayed here I'm quite sure paled in comparison to the real thing, and that realization saddened me even further. I couldn't help but think that all those brave souls didn't stand a chance. Thanks to the Military Industrial Complex, they weren't given the opportunity to defend themselves, and they went down fighting the best they could.As for the rest of the movie, the makers thought they could use the love-triangle formula from Titanic, and in that respect they fail miserably. The moment that first bomb landed in Pearl Harbor, everything else was rendered meaningless. All of a sudden, the problems of three people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world, yet I'm supposed to still care about these people and their pitiful concerns.I could more than tolerate Kate Beckinsale. She did an admirable job, and the horror and disbelief he displayed when the victims started rolling in after the attack began was probably not too far off from what the real-life nurses demonstrated that day. She was very much in the moment. While I thought that Ben Affleck was excellent in Argo, he brought nothing here. I think he's come a long way since this mess. In what was supposed to be his big ""breakout"" role, Josh Hartnett exhibited a range similar to that of wallpaper.Aside from the attack, the other reason I don't despise this film with every fiber of my being is that I saw this for $6.50 at a matinee. For some reason, that made the whole experience less painful."	2.0	30 minutes of greatness. The rest is garbage.	2014-01-10	2	2	0

In short, the movie was at first a love story followed by the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and lastly a top secret mission to bomb Japan.  The plot flowed well and the character development was quite good.  Some may find the love story to be over-the-top for a movie such as this but it threaded through the entire movie seamlessly.(TV: 32&quot; Sony Trinitron (KV-32S40))(DVD player: Panasonic RP-56)(Cables: Acoustic Reasearch top-of-the-line)Picture quality: Excellent.  Crisp and clear as paper.Sound quality: EXCELLENT.  I cannot say *enough* about the DTS soundtrack with this film.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3LCYZJ5OZ5DVW	"ENRIQUE VELASQUEZ ""EV"""	To be as objective as one can this film has two good things. 1) the cinematography (very likely an Oscar winner in this Dept.) and 2) The Pearl Harbor attack scene. The rest of the movie is so predictible, boring, and not with  the high quality acting you expect to see to begin with. You literally don't believe the characters (and their &quot;love&quot; for each other) What I believe killed this from being the next Big Oscar winner is the final scene which has no sense or purpose to the whole movie (except to prolong it for another 30 minutes or so...)

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A228NBNLYJ8V3J	Eran Cohen	"This film has made me realize once again that some films just can't hit any meaningful target despite the dealing with important, hard and weighty issues.I came to this conclusion a year ago watching ""The Patriot"", reassured my suspicions seeing ""Cast Away"", and now, confirmed it with this try to give life to one of America's most painful and humiliating experiences ever.""Pearl harbor"" could be so much more. I have to say this attempt really made me sorry - what a waste of good money and maybe good intentions. Look, the battle scenes were good, but not beyond that .They became the center of the movie - as it should or shouldn't be - you`ll have to decide about that .The main problem is that the makers didn't succeed in preparing decent preface to this `suppose to be' peak of the film. Meaning, you know from the start `the bombardment' is coming - sooner or later (in the end, you've come to see a recreation of a major historical event, didn't you?), and the one thing you're seeking more than that (the `addition'), is a character or characters to relate to in order to better feel the reality of horror people felt in that moment.  You strive to relive, for a while, the feelings, emotions, fears and wishes they experienced and endured in such a fearsome event - with the good help of the cinematic art.  I believe this addition gives a film its right to exist, and separate it from a common documentary.I didn't get that at all, and that's why the film lost its major artistic purpose. Then comes my question -why? I know it wasn't made to be in the caliber of ""Saving Private Ryan"", but it should have had something at least slightly deep in it ! I absolutely DID NOT find any of that kind, and that's a shame.  I don't disregard the producers' main purpose to address the majority of the cinema visitors - teenagers. Still, they could have done better.To be more specific- Cast and Crew : they had plenty of money to spend, and could easily recruit a first class mature actor to be in charge of the `meaningful parts' of the film. The young players, the majority of the crew, did not deliver; they only went through the motions. I couldn't really identify with their conflicts and struggles.The characters and acting- Affleck , the leading actor was so annoying ,arrogant, and over confident, I couldn't care less for his fate. I didn't care for his friend either - he was too pale and uninteresting to notice. The nurse - she was just a beauty and that's it - lacked the ability to make me feel for her. In short, it's true what they said- this was a high school acting performance.The length of the film - not everyone should contend  ""BreaveHeart""! For god's sake, you're not suppose to torture people with two long stories in one film! I know a vengeance is expected, but you'd have to cut down to make the crowd awake. I've seen a confirmation of the historical accuracy of the film in the ""History Channel"" which is a bright light in the big picture - but some things can be passed over.The plot - Wallace was a dissapointment, he'd veered from his main serious stream of writing that was remarkable in &quot;BreaveHeart&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. It's obvious he has the ability create strong emotional drama with historical epic as a background or a sidekick. Too bad he missed it with this remarkable opportunity. Another thing bothers me; I can equalize the plot in some points to ""Titanic"" : there is a big event that's coming you're way. You want to wrap it up neatly in order to give it a standing ability, so you invent a love story. You cast a good-looking crew. You bore us to death with it, we stay awake only because something grandiose is to come. Than the event comes (a sinking ship/bombardment). But in ""Pearl Harbor"" it's not the end! He had to introduce another big event - because two is better than one! In all, he also exaggerated.Enough said. See it only if you have to, it's almost a complete waste of time. I want my three hours back!Ps, women would, occasionally, find this film acceptable because of the touchy love story. Anyway, consider carefully before spending your money."	2.0	Why ?	2001-08-09	9	6	3

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2P9DY2Q2T043E	Eric Jeter	"The new Pearl Harbor could have been an epic.  Unfortunately, it'll wind up as just another of Jerry Bruckheimer's formulaic action movies, akin to Con-Air and Armageddon.Despite the often jaw dropping special effects, Pearl fails to convey the take-you-there realism and gritty humanity of true war classics like Saving Private Ryan.  Each time the movie begins to approach this height, something's either said or done that reminds you that this is little more than a garden-variety action movie attempting to capitalize on the patriotic zeal of it's viewers.  Contributing to this feeling are instances of ill-timed humor, lines and clich&eacute;'s that smack of typical action movie bravado, and more than a few obviously contrived action scenes (like a shot of five or six planes with guns blazing chasing down one car occupied by the movies heroes).The movies' initially engaging love story later becomes irksome.  All the mid-drifts, tender moments, and whiny violin  music can't save the storyline from inducing feelings more akin to watching a Jerry Springer show than a 1941 war epic. Unlike Titanic, Pearl's messy romance is not intricately woven with the action but stands aloof, giving the film a disjointed feel. In fact, so much attention is paid to these amorous interests that the film is actually weighed down by them, making the great battle scenes seem more like obligatory interludes.If you ""go see movies for the special effects"", then by all means plop your seven bucks down and give Pearl Harbor a try.  But the more discerning moviegoer, who asks for more than a few ooh's and aah's, will find this picture only another summer film thin on substance but heavy on fluff.Jeter (jeter@insight.rr.com)"	3.0	Pearl Harbor: Unrealized Potential	2001-05-29	7	3	4

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1FMJJKSVQDDQ	Eric S. Kim	You know, I can think of other film directors besides Michael Bay who could have done a much better job of filming Pearl Harbor, a film that had lots of potential before it was turned into an overproduced train wreck. Let's see, there's Michael Mann, Ridley Scott, Terrance Malick, heck, even Stephen Spielberg! But what did Touchstone do? Accept a horrible script and hire Michael Bay (of all people!) to direct a romantic film that just happens to be set before, during, and after the notorious attack of Pearl Harbor. To be honest, I don't completely hate Bay. He has created two great action films: The Rock and Bad Boys II (the former being slightly more realistic than the latter). But to have him do a historical film like this? Something toxic must have been in the producers' coffee, because what we get is something that's uneven and unconvincing. This is basically a love story that's mixed with a major historical event, and we've seen that sort of film before, haven't we? *cough* Titanic *cough*The only good things about this film are the special effects, the action, and the drama during the actual attack on the harbor.  The rest of the film is nothing but an embarrassment. The actors' talents have been wasted because of a script that's filled with silly dialogue and cliched scenarios. The film itself is too darn long: even if it is supposed to be a war epic, it certainly doesn't feel like a war film at all. But I think the worst thing about this movie is the fact that they just happened to insert a romantic plot, a love triangle that has nothing to do with Pearl Harbor itself. The film would have worked better if it was a coming-of-age story, or a political thriller. But no, we have uninteresting characters falling in love with each other, and all of it is just painful to sit through. It's more of a soap opera, at least to me. Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, Josh Hartnett, Alex Baldwin, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, and Cuba Gooding Jr. are all very good actors. It's too bad, however, that they had to appear in this wasted opportunity of a war epic.I don't know about you, but all of the men and women who have lost their lives on December 7th, 1941, deserve a more provocative film about that dreadful day. The brilliant special effects and the intense action sequences really cannot make up for the inappropriate romance, the dull characters, the unbelievably bad script, and the obvious cliches that take control of this movie. I think I should check out Tora! Tora! Tora! very soon.Grade: D-	2.0	"You actually call THIS a ""war film?"""	2009-11-18	3	3	0

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A186O61T87WGYG	E S	Peral Harbor is apparently the first DVD issued with a audio processing for headphones, designed to emulate Dolby 5.1 surround sound. It is one of 4 audio tracks on this dvd. The Dolby headphone works well, adding a great sense of ambience to the sound and a richness to the bass frequencies.  The sound projects behind  as well as somewhat forward. It doesn't sound exactly like a surround sound speaker system but it greatly enhances the movie experience, although doubt that I would like it for regular music.  It should convert many viewers to headphone listening with movies. Sound quality is generally obtained with headphones at a fraction of the price of speakers, so Dolby headphone listening presents a potentially much cheaper approach to good movie sound than investing in a 5 or more channel speaker set-up. (...)As for the movie itself, it was effective for me, although I can see why some reviewers objected to it's stylistic  quirks, e.g. slow-mo shots, the high contrast look which reminded me of tv commercials and the cliches and lapses in the story.  It was nevertheless, in my opinion better than Titanic, which it somewhat resembles with its weaving of a romantic story around a historical disaster.	4.0	Thumbs up for Dolby headphone	2001-12-07	0	0	0

Superb cinematically, writing, acting, editing, sets, costumes, etc., etc.[It's also the last movie filmed in Wide-Screen Technicolor and it doesn't get any better than that.]How anyone can say it's not accurate is beyond me too, as so much was happening at that moment in history, everyone had a different angle, a different point of view, a different experience.**I read it was screened for surviving WWII vets who found it very realistic, down to the bullet holes on the tarmac that are said to be still visible today.Of course the movie's characters are fictitious, as they are a conglomerate of peoples' lives at that time and place.  The stars and costars did an excellent job of bringing me into their personal stories. *I HIGHLY Recommend it.** If you're going to purchase this movie, I'd suggest getting an anniversary edition such as this, as the movie merits it.

The interaction between the main characters are shallow and it seems like an hour action movie with 2 hours of thin plots and poor scripts to fill it out. The love plot between the 3 characters are very corny and detracts from an otherwise okay action flick. I must admit the CG effects are very good and the action scenes are great but even with the action it seems to run out of steam towards the end with the raid of Japan scene. It seems very rushed and there's no sense of climax at all. Audio wise it's very average, no big gun sounds but instead sounds very tinny. Actually, the whole movie sounds very tinny besides the explosions which makes decent use of your subwoofer. If you're a die-hard war film fan and you've seen Saving Private Ryan there's little you'll appreciate in this movie.	2.0	A great disappointment	2001-12-19	0	0	0

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A38467NO4F89I2	Fascination with Fear	Pearl Harbor is basically a Hollywood movie but it does bring to life one of the greatest tragedies in American history in a way that people can relate to. Sure, we all read about the bombing of Pearl Harbor in history class, but to see it come to life on the big screen and to throw in such a heartwrenching love story with it really hits home. Ben Affleck as Rafe and Josh Harnett as Danny really come off as true &quot;brothers in arms&quot; - they, along with Kate Beckinsale as Evelyn, tell a story that most people (skip the critics opinions, they always bash big Hollywood productions) will be thinking about even after they leave the theater - as it could happen to anyone. The story was somewhat predictable, but it doesn't make it any less poignant. You find yourself rooting for both love stories throughout the movie. The Hawaiian scenery can only make it more romantic.  I saw this movie twice within one week and loved it even more the second time.  Try it - you will agree.  I saw alot of WWII-age men and women in the audience and can only hope the movie does some justice to the actual horrific events that they lived through. I really haven't heard too many bad reviews from movie-goers. Treat it like the summer blockbuster it is and you will enjoy it thoroughly.	4.0	RE: Pearl Harbor	2001-06-11	1	0	1

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3BAVTYVVOAEQ	FireCat	It's not so much the fact that they combined a love story with war - many times that works.  Often love and war, or love and action go well together.  It worked fantastically for Top Gun, Titanic, and even Star Wars.  Without the love story, I think Top Gun and Titanic would have crashed and burned and then sunk on their maiden week in the theatres, maybe even Star Wars too.  It even works in war movies in small degrees when done right.  An example that comes to my mind is &quot;The Blue Max&quot;.  That little affair with Ursula didn't hurt the movie at all, it added a little spice and intrigue and a lot of character development for Bruno.Pearl Harbor is very different. Basically, the whole movie sucked, in my opinion, for many reasons - not because it was a combination love story and war story, but because the whole movie was just boring as hell.The movie did not have any heart or passion to it. It had no tension, and didn't get me involved in anything. I simply didn't care about the characters or feel involved in the story.  So whatever that movie tried to be, it failed everywhere.  It failed as a love story, as a documentary, as a war movie, as an action movie, and it had no drama.Why did something that could have and should have been epically great end up like this is hard to answer from a non-insider.  But it's a pattern I've many times before.  My overall take is that the producers said they wanted this movie to be like the Titanic.  They presume (falsely IMO) that women only want to see love stories, and therefore that must be present for a movie to succeed.Secondly, they tried to make this movie according to some Politically Correct formula:  a) must have a love story; b) do not show anything gory, violent, or emotional that could possibly make a viewer become the next Columbine killer; c) no sex or passion; d) do not offend anyone; e) use church music throughout the entire move, etc.  The result being Pure Boredom.Some details:Soundtrack:  What soundtrack?  They completely forgot that great music makes great movies.  The audio stimulation of sound in a movie is almost as important as the visual one. Think of your favorite movies and you'll know the songs that made it great.Sound - Effects: I guess this is the one thing that was authentic; I think they used movie sound technology used in the 1940's.  Was that little buzzing sound supposed to be the earth shaking, roaring thunder of a squadron of WWII fighters flying 10 feet above the ground blazing away with their machine guns?Sound - Background:  I am so sick hearing &quot;church music&quot; played in the background of almost every movie made recently.  God, it makes me want to throw-up.Costumes:  The garments may have been the style of the 40's but there is a whole lot more to presenting a historic character than just the costume.  It also involves hairstyles, makeup, speech, gestures, and mannerism. All the characters looked and talked like they do now, year 2001, just wearing a 40's style dress.Cinematography:  Bad.  Very bad.  The lighting looked like the whole movie was shot in a studio.  The most memorable violation was when Major Doolittle was talking to Danny Walker (Hartnett) on the bow of the aircraft carrier at sea in a storm.  Geeze, they could have at least set a fan next to them to give some sort of simulation that they were even outside, let alone in a storm at sea. The entire movie was this way.  All sets, props, vehicles and people were way too polished.  Lighting was more like a soap opera then outdoors.Historical Accuracy:Well, yes, some American pilots fought in &quot;The Battle of Britain&quot;; Japan did attack Pearl Harbor with carrier-launched aircraft, and later the United States launched bombers from a carrier which dropped some bombs on mainland Japan.  Theodore Roosevelt was the President and was crippled at the time and in a wheelchair although I doubt he stood up. Radar did pick-up the flight of incoming Japanese aircraft and the alert was ignored; most all the American planes were parked and lined up on the runway making them perfect targets, and most of the ammunition was locked-up so it wouldn't be stolen.Almost everything else in the movie is fiction, and the details of the props and articles in the movie were not too accurate either.  Two things that come to mind is the color picture in the upper left corner of some letter or memo and another was the calendar on the Japanese ship reading December 7th (Since Japan is on the other side of the date line than the United States, for them, it was December 8th).Action:I doubt that the Japanese bombers carried much machinegun ammo and if they did, I doubt they used it to shoot drowning sailors in the water.  Their objective was to destroy as many ships as they could, and had barely enough fuel to return, let alone have extra to waste flying around shooting people on the ground or in the water.  And the job of the Japanese fighters was to protect the bombers.  I also found the dogfights to very poorly filmed.  They were probably the most boring I have ever seen.The good news about this film is that a lot of people are seeing it.  That shows that there is a lot of interest in this subject by people today.  Hopefully, as a result, more films about war will be made in the future, and hopefully, much better than this one.	1.0	How NOT to make a war movie	2001-05-28	51	31	20

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3CWH6VKCTJAD	"""flickjunkie"""	"Given the choice between producing a popular film and a great film, producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Armageddon, Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop, ConAir) will always choose the popular film.  He is nothing if not consistent.  His films always make lots of money and seldom deliver much more than slick eye candy for the masses.  Bruckheimer has a golden opportunity to depart from his blockbuster mentality with this film, but he goes with his business instincts rather than taking a chance with a filmmaker's approach.  The result is another big budget crowd pleaser with a cotton candy plot and terrific battle scenes, aided by impressive digital effects.The script by Randall Wallace of ""Braveheart"" fame is the biggest problem.  Wallace is clearly capable of writing an engaging script, but that obviously isn't what the boss wanted.  It seems that Bruckheimer has Titanic envy and tries to use the same formula of wrapping a piece of history around a love story.  Either that or he is trying to follow in the footsteps of ""From Here to Eternity"", the much acclaimed 1953 story that occurs as a prelude to the attack on Pearl Harbor.  However, FHTE did not pretend to be a story ABOUT Pearl Harbor, and only included the attack as another disruptive event in an emotionally tumultuous story.  While FHTE was a gripping and powerful story of love, hatred, lust and honor, PH is a trite and predictable love story that serves an interminable prelude to 30 minutes of terrific battle scenes.  The inadvertent love triangle between best friends could have been predicted by a teenager (which seemed to be the target audience of this film, based on the PG rating and the sappy dialogue).  And of course the resolution of the dilemma is just as neat and obvious.  Personally, I would have preferred it if they had killed Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) in the attack and given Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) an opportunity for some real soul searching as they went on their top secret mission.  But such nuance is far too risky for Bruckheimer.Director Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Rock) isn't known for his subtle and insightful direction of human stories.  Bay is known for his explosions, and predictably the human story is bungled while the battle is extraordinary.  Bay directs a period piece without much regard for understanding and reproducing the 1940's.  It seems all he cares about is the military angle.  The costume design and hair for the girls costumes was merely good while the military costumes are perfect.  Mostly, the `40's feel is missing.  The music is all wrong.  It should have been big band music instead of the standard blockbuster symphonic compositions which did not fit the period at all.  Various details are overlooked, like the fact that well more than half of young adults of that era smoked.  Not one character in the film smoked, nor was there a single cigarette to be found in the nightclub scene.  Rent any film from the forties and fifties and notice how many people smoke.  Everybody.  Another thing that is incredible is the fact that Evelyn, who was having morning sickness on December 7 is not showing in mid April, more than four months later.  Perhaps if she were 200 lbs I could believe that, but the lithe Evelyn would have shown more than a little pooch by then.Also missing are the colloquialisms of the day.  Not a single ""swell"", ""dame"", ""jeepers"" or ""ain't"" in the whole film.  No Brooklyn or Chicago accents.  Everyone speaks perfect twenty first century Funk and Wagnall's College English.The battle scene is a marvel of action filmmaking.  It is highly realistic as a depiction of the battle, but there was a lot of cheating that didn't escape the notice of WWII buffs.  It is pretty amazing that Bruckheimer got so much cooperation from the US government in being able to film in the Harbor.  The government even loaned the production company numerous mothballed ships.  Unfortunately, a lot of them were ships designed and built after WWII and they didn't bother to clean them up in post production.  They built a complete digital world and left post WWII ships in the picture.  That is just poor attention to detail in a film that is all about detail.  Still, by any standard, this is fantastic action sequence that could not have been more realistic than had one actually been there.The acting is mixed.  Beckingsale is excellent as Evelyn.  She creates a very appealing romantic figure.  Ben Affleck is too moody and sarcastic in the role.  Josh Hartnett is much better, coming across as far more sincere and relating to his character better than Affleck.  Affleck seems content to play Ben Affleck in uniform rather than trying to actually flesh out a character.Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an excellent performance in a minor role.  Veterans Alec Baldwin and Jon Voight do a marvelous job as Colonel Doolitle and FDR.I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of the visual effects.  It would have been much better if it had been about Pearl Harbor instead of being a schmaltzy love triangle story that coincided with the attack.  The entire event that is Pearl Harbor is shrouded in intriguing questions.  Did Roosevelt know about the attack in advance and allow it to happen to get us into the war?  Many historical facts indicate that was the case (it is thought to be more than just lucky that the aircraft carriers weren't in the harbor that day).  What was really going on in the minds of the Japanese?  Were the diplomatic efforts of the US designed to force the Japanese into attacking us as a matter of honor?  As much as I despise Oliver Stone, this film would have been substantial if it had been done in his docudrama style (without the historical rewrites of course).Instead we have another puff piece by the master of puff.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A29QA79VLQGHY6	Flipper Campbell	"Director Bay kept his powder dry on the initial Commemorative Edition of ""Pearl Harbor"" that came out Memorial Day 2001, saving the real DVD firepower for this Fourth of July. Bay's latest campaign has produced the most ambitious DVD set to date. ""Pearl Harbor: The Director's Cut"" is made for people who are serious about film, art, technology and/or war. It's packed with special effects breakdowns, historical insight, full-length commentaries, interviews with survivors and a maze of other extras. There's a movie in here somewhere, but those seeking the popcorn experience should go with the original DVD. The stunning audio and video are at least as good on the 2001 release; most people won't be able to tell a lot of content has been crammed onto the movie discs.Bay recut the film to add more realistic combat footage (mostly gore) and to remove some of the sappier moments (what he calls ""earnest dialogue""). The changes -- including a shot of a severed head rolling around on a ship -- probably won't change anyone's opinion of the movie. ""I always wanted to shoot (it as) an R-rated film,"" Bay says.An interactive breakdown of the 27-minute attack sequence (on Disc 4) allows viewers to watch animatics or storyboards while comparing them to shots of the crew filming and the finished product. Several commentaries cover the attack section, including one with effects supervisor Eric Brevig. The audio also can be manipulated to isolate the sound effects and music. A fun featurette shows the actors going through a hurry-up boot camp with real drill sergeants at an Army base, with Affleck looking particularly miserable and a game Baldwin providing a slow-moving target.The DVD set's historical content includes a fascinating documentary on U.S.-Japanese relations that covers several hundred years. The docu, unfortunately, was chopped up to fit a graphic timeline format that yanks viewers out of the narrative."	4.0	Bay gets his way	2002-07-11	6	3	3

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1C1GK59WNL2V5	Forrest	When I was younger I played this movie so many times the VHS tapes it was on were worn out. I have always been fascinated with war movies and airplanes as well. Although this movie isn't strictly about aircraft battles, I still feel it is a decent movie to this day. I'm a big fan of VFX so that makes me appreciate Michael Bay's work. They may not have the best stories, but they are still enjoyable to watch because I love the art of film making. Particularly flicks with action featured in it.As far as the Blu Ray goes, it definitely looks well, but as any old movie, the film grain is pretty heavy. I have heard that they formatted this movie on Blu Ray wrong, so that could also be a problem. In my opinion, Pearl Harbor looks a little under 720p in terms of the way the film looks on it. It definitely doesn't look as good as the Blu Rays that are out today, but it looks better than a DVD if that makes any sense.	5.0	Always Enjoyed as a Kid!	2014-06-22	0	0	0

Affleck &amp; Co. prove that even the most capable actors can't save such a poor screenplay. and Bruckheimer proves that he can finance stuff blowing up real good. if you want good action, try Die Hard. if you want good romance, try Titanic. Disney's ad campaign was based on stuff blowing up, and those expecting 3 hours of explosions will be sorely dissapointed. it's more 2 1/2 hours of tedious romance. even the film's obvious interest in becoming what it ultimatley was not and it's action cannot save it.it's not detestable, but it's not interesting. and it's not effective, but it's at least slightly distracting. avoid this padded out and ludicrous excuse for a Very Important Movie.	1.0	Michael Bay Blows Even More Stuff Up.	2001-12-08	7	6	1

It was filled with a cheesy love subplot (if you want to go see a recent love movie this long, go rent Titanic) that was so cliche that I couldn't believe it was actually not editted from the movie. I was hoping to see a movie that dealt with the Pearl Harbor incident and didn't focus so much on relationships and love, but what should I expect with a &quot;blockbuster&quot; hit that Hollywood produces. Some of the points in the plot, particularily towards the end (don't want to give anything away) were so unrealistic that it almost seemed comical.I'm not knocking movies that deal with relationships because I do like them, but this movie was really a boring movie. There are many movies that never make it to the show that are far better in realism and expression than this. It's just another Hollywood attempt to throw some big stars on screen and cash in some bucks. Well it worked; too bad the movie didn't.	2.0	Vastly overrated film	2002-07-05	9	7	2

But the acting was decent enough to make you care about the characters.  Ben Affleck's Tennessee accent was overdone but he was able to make Rafe's emotions believable.  Jon Voight and Alec Baldwin were exceptional though I don't know why Doolittle thought they were gonna win the war through Rafe and Danny.  These guys embodied their characters' tough, no-nonsense attitudes.  The historical aspects were smoothly woven into the main plot.  Plus, the humor is well-done.

I have read may of the reviews by other members, and the derogatory comments they have made about the film, and yes, from their point of view, they are correct.  What you have to understand before you can really appreciate a film like this is that although part of the plot is fiction, the rest is not. This means that the creators have to make the film fit into the framework of established historical fact. Not only the historic lines, but also the culture, the attitude of people in general, and the overall norms of that time.  With this premise out of the way, I found the film to be very entertaining, romantic, and extremely authentic as far as props, attitudes, and historic content. It was a well spent three hours that I would do again.  For me, it really answered many questions I had about the WWII era that in my personal research, I could not answer. In addition, being a hopeless romantic, I really loved the story, which was authentic for that time, as to how people acted.	1.0	Pearl Harbor	2008-09-27	11	2	9

I saw it Memorial Weekend and was deeply hurt by what the film did.The main problem I had with 'Pearl Harbor' was the script. Not only did it limit Kate Beckinsale's ability to show her acting muscles, it also ruined the ending. Seriously, the conclusion so predictable, it berates screenwriter Randall Wallace's (Braveheart) talent. The cliques and the cheesiness were just endless.Not all of it can be blamed for by the script. It seems like the lead actor, Ben Affleck didn't have chemistry with any other cast member besides Alec Baldwin's Col. Dolitle. As one critic say, &quot;Ben Affleck was playing a movie star playing a war pilot.&quot;I was extremely impressed with Josh Hartnett (Danny) and Kate Becksinale (Everlyn)'s performance. They literally got me through the last hour of the movie. Hartnett showed signs of charisma and talent, finally pulling away from tenn projects like 'H20' and 'The Faculty'. I applaud him for that. Beckinsale and Hartnett garnered onscreen chemistry and it showed in the &quot;They Don't Need To Go (Where Danny asks Everlyn to ride on the plane)&quot; scene.The visual effects of this movie were FANTASTIC!

Grey ""the Wizard"""	So, I've just walked in the house from a crowded first showing of &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, and as is my want, I am reporting in, an array of feelings and observations, but, read the end before you decide my real take on this flick.No one in Hollywood has ever heard a real gun fired. I know many of you have, and you know how damn loud a 45 is and can easily imagine how loud a 50 cal machine gun is, and 4 50's in a plane...Mitchell Field is on Long Island, in New York. There are NO MOUNTAINS on Long Island, hell, there ain't many hills......The single most treacherous point about the attack on Pearl Harbor was that the ambassador delived the ultimatium 55 minutes AFTER the bombing was reported to the White House, and because of that screw up in timing, an attack that was an act of war, became an unexpected surprise attack and was seen for all time as an act of trechery, even though it wasn't planned that way.....The commander of that attack had been educated in the States, Harvard, and once he became aware of the timing problem, he was filled with dread, because he knew nothing would infuriate America more than a sneak attack. It must have been a very, very bad moment when he found out, like time had stopped, as his comments show...In the 40's all our war films had charcaters we could see events through, to personalize things that were very recent, and in people's memories, and indeed, we were not accustomed to the History Channel, the Discovery Channel, The Learning Channel.....etc.......The great flim makers knew that a block buster is filled with cameos by stars in little roles, that get the audience to nudge each other when they come on (The most recent example: JFK, where almost every part was a recognizeable star, ie: John Candy had bit part he played in a BIG way.)The actual attack came in two waves that lasted for two hours...You don't put A Baldwin in anything Patriotic....Willlis......that's who should have had that role.....And if you're going to spend $135 million on a movie, you spend enough on FDR's makeup so you can't see where it's glued to John Voight's face.Old fashioned experience...this is where a MOVIE studio like Fox or MGM would have made a difference.But...The theme song to MST 3000 states not to worry about all these things and sit back and enjoy it for what it is, and if you keep that in mind, you will absolutely love this film.Indeed, go see it again now that you know where it's coming from, and you will really enjoy it....	4.0	Mystery Science Theater 3000 and Pearl Harbor	2001-05-27	2	2	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A33BM95MUOF2FM	"""garethc"""	As an Englishman I came away from this film with a sickly feeling in the pit of my stomach.  As eye candy goes and as exciting action packed special effects sequences goes - it works.  It seems that Americans have a real, nagging guilt about joining the war so late and this film attempts to sooth it.  The scenes with Ben Affleck fighting alongside the RAF is just disgraceful, putting a huge spotlight on a small American participation before they joined the war for real.  More Canadians, Aussies and New Zealanders fought in the 1940/41 air battles over the channel and Southern England than Americans.  To hear and RAF officer quote &quot;If all Yanks are like you then God help any country who makes war on America&quot; turned my stomach and the Scottish airman who looks on as Affleck jumped into his plane to fight the Luftwaffe to &quot;help us out&quot; looks on admiringly and says &quot;God speed to you Sir!&quot;  What a joke!  This is a film that tries to be everything, a love story, a heroic war story but laughingly of all it tries to be a history lesson which is what really niggles.  It is such an Americanisation of events that Gee I'm just sooo glad us little, quaint English people could help y'all win it!  After 3 hours of fake events and distortions I was bored to tears and very upset.  In a scene Pres. Roosevelt says &quot;Many have claimed that we let the British and the Russians do our fighting for us ....&quot; and up until you got a taste of the action thats exactly what you did.  Hey, we don't hold it against you at all, it was team effort (after we won the first few rounds to convince you we might win ie. Battle Of Britain, El Alamien, Stalingrad).  To really get my goat up was the end dialogue which wasn't changed for British viewers in which &quot;America&quot; and &quot;Americans&quot; were mentioned so many times that there were groans from all around the cinema, indeed it was so sicophantic that perhaps George W. should use it one of his speeches.  The fact that the voice speaking these words was a talented and beautiful English actress, Kate Beckinsale, speaking in an American accent was the final straw.  By all means make war films, make war films where only Americans were involved (although admittedly these are few and far between) but don't try to take all the credit and twist history to your own way of thinking.  Go on tell us you helped win at Stalingrad or in India.  Go on I dare ya!	1.0	A Total Americanised Distortion Of History	2001-06-01	7	3	4
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A23T5A0BEJN04R	Garrett	Without a doubt, Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer did the best they could.  And the end result of their achievments is a 3 hour long movie spectacular that touches every emotion, every feeling and it does so with class.  PLEASE do not listen to the banalaties of the movie critics, as they show once again how out of touch they are with America's taste in movies and what we WANT to see.  This movie is worth the $6 you have to plunk down for a ticket.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2HU94KJ4SUFR0	"Garrett Stiger ""Gar"""	Pearl Harbor is a movie that tries too hard to make too much money by giving us harrowing battles, Hollywood hunks, and a Hollywood romance. It's real focus should be to honor those who died at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.Michael Bay's flashy direction is quite evident here. In many of his shots it is quite apparent that he is &quot;borrowing&quot; from Titanic and Saving Private Ryan.Unfortunately, Randall Wallace's screenplay is overly cliched and is chalk full of one-dimensional characters. The lines of dialogue are really annoying and melodramatic.The performances, like the screenplay, are also pretty bad. Ben Affleck needed more expression and emotion both in his speech and facial expressions. Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett aren't much better, when they try to be emotional it's painfully clear that their emotions are forced and fake. Cuba Gooding Jr. overplays his character but his screen time is minimum so he's not as annoying as he would be. Thankfully, Jon Voight is very convincing as President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He gives the best performance of the film.The pacing is both poor and good. The beginning of the film is rather slow. There's simply too much there and yet what is there is quite hollow. It tries to be funny and dramatic but it doesn't succeed at any of these. On the other hand, the editing for the battle scenes is appropriately face-paced and riveting.The CGI work was pretty good; the plane crashes were a little repetitious in their execution. The sound effects and sound effects editing are pretty good.John Schwartzman's cinematography is reasonably good. His use of the `shaky cam' technique is reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan.Hans Zimmer's melodramatic musical score suits the vast scale of the film nicely.With a little more care placed in the editing, better actors, and a tighter script; Pearl Harbor MIGHT have become the gem it was made out to be through its overly extensive advertising.	1.0	Decent visual and audio effects DON'T make a good film.	2001-08-02	11	9	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	APLAYRDGF11H2	Garrett Yarbrough	I do agree with others, this movie is more about a love triangle story than about the Pearl Harbor attack itself.  When you finally get to see some action and shooting etc, the next chapter is on with the love triangle story.  Somehow it manages to stay with the Plot of Pearl Harbor, not sure how.  I guess I was somewhat dissappointed aswell.  I figured there would be some love story in it, but not every other chapter of it.  Enemy At The Gates fell pray to the same sorta problem in a ways, it to had a love triangle story in it, but it was a well plotted movie and in some sense better than this movies plot.  Saving Private Ryan is still one of my favorites.  If you never seen this movie, its worth watching once atleast.	3.0	A Somewhat Good War Film...	2007-04-23	3	1	2

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV	"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT"""	"By announcing itself as absolutely, irreproachably authentic and realistic when it is obviously anything but, PEARL HARBOR doesn't so much invite invite criticism as flat-out begs for it. Both story and script are a mixture of Hollywood stereotype and bad dialogue. At one point during the attack at Pearl Harbor, a character says, ""I think World War II just started!"" and this is rather typical of the movie as a whole: obviously improbable, assuming the audience knows nothing, and flogging every clich&eacute; to the nth degree. Even so, the lead actors have enough appeal and some of those stereotypes and cliches are still powerful enough to keep the film watchable, and the battle sequences are visually impressive.PEARL HARBOR is a soap opera concerning a love triangle between two friends and a beautiful navy nurse. This plot line, which occupies the first third of the film, asks us to believe the proverbial six impossible things before breakfast and predictably reaches a peak just in time for the Japanese attack. The second third of the film shows the attack itself. I cannot say how accurate the film is in its details of the assault (although I did have enough sense to wonder what happened to the second wave); it is, however, excitingly filmed and it is easily the most successful portion of the film. And yet, it is here the film falls completely apart by allowing our two male leads to usurp the roles of the two real-life men who actually managed to get planes off the ground. Predictably, our heros perform all sorts of acrobatics, blow Japanese Zeros all over the sky, and survive to return to the woman they love: Hollywood unreality at its most ludicrous.The last third of the film is total nonsense. Our two pilots (who have by now been childhood friends, gone to flight school together, become pilots together, fallen in love with the same woman together, and survived Pearl Harbor together) are now asked to volunteer for the Doolittle Raid on Japan--and by this point viewers may actually begin to wonder why they are bothering with the nurse. They seem more like lovers than buddies. Ultimately, the film is affecting almost in spite of itself, but you have to put your mind on total hold to enjoy it. It isn't ""THE"" Pearl Harbor film--that title still properly belongs to ""Tora! Tora! Tora!""The DVD contains a History Channel documentary re Pearl Harbor that is very good, a ""Making Of"" documentary that is disgracefully and distastefully self-congratulatory, and a number of other extras, some of which you will need a computer to access. The picture quality and sound are excellent throughout. Sadly, the movie itself is not."	3.0	Put Your Mind On Hold	2002-01-10	1	1	0

Now why couldn't 'Saving Private Ryan' treat the war in the innocent way it was meant? We also learn that the poor put upon Japanese were victimised by the USA with an oil blockade. Now why would they go and do a darn fool thing like that? No doubt the gospel according to Jerry would explain Nanking over their failure to lend the imperial army a cup of sugar.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1Z4GK0BE4K1Z1	Gary (Movie Buff) Rizzato	Dear Reader, Pearl Harbor, has a cliched love story yes, but in my opinion during world war II there was love storys like this, unbelievable, but there our people lived during this time and said it really happened.Pearl harbor stars Josh Hartnett (Danny) Ben Affleck (Rafe) Kate Beckinsale(Evelyn) and co-starring Cuba Gooding Jr, Alec Baldwin, Dan Akroyd, and Jon Voight as President Roosevelt. All of these actors do good in there roles, especially cuba and jon, they give award performances.  Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (The Rock, Armageddon, and Top Gun) Directed by Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Rock, and Bad Boys) also produced by chad oman (enemy of the state, gone in sixty seconds. The screenplay is written by Randall Wallace, academy award winner for his screenplay for Braveheart. Randall also exec. produced this film as well as Braveheart. Music by Oscar Winner Hans Zimmer (Gladiator,and The Rock).The war sequence, you have never seen anything like this before, the visual effects seem to blow me away. It is like Saving Private Ryan mixed with Titanic, with a little of Top Gun. All of this makes for some great visual effects.If you are really in to movies as well as the music hear the score, it is excellent. I recommend the soundtrack too, as well as the movie, i don't think you will be disappointed.	5.0	A love story perfected with action.	2001-08-17	3	0	3

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2D5WSXSNUYW41	"""gasscrazy"""	I first saw this movie in the theaters with my grandmother.  She was stationed in Hawaii as military nurse when Pearl Harbor was bombed, so this movie has more than just historical value, it has personal value.The movie recounts the events of Pearl Harbor through the lives of three people, two best friends that are pilots, and one nurse, who they are both in love with.At times the movie is a bit slow, and the love story a little tedious, but it does not distract too much from the overall film.  The action sequences are amazing, with fresh perspectives not seen in any other film in recent memory.You'll feel American pride at the end of the film, especially with recent events.  If you want to get a dose of what it would have been like to be in Pearl Harbor at the time of the raids, then get this movie, sit down, and don't expect to take your eyes away for the next three hours.This is a great film that I highly reccomend.	4.0	Remember the Fallen	2002-07-18	3	1	2

Instead, we got a trite love story/soap opera and a ridiculous series of events with the lead character (Ben Affleck) fighting the Battle of Britain, fighting the Japanese at Pearl Harbor (while reminding me of scenes and dialog from TOP GUN), and then bombing Tokyo. As a career Naval Aviator and student of history, I found the events depicted in a manner so inaccurate (read: ""Hollywood"") as to be insulting to the participants. I found the choice of Alec Baldwin to play Col. Dolittle especially revolting. There would have been more than enough drama in the truthful and accurate representation of some of the most significant events in our history...it's a shame the makers chose to make a film of this disappointing caliber."	1.0	Very Disappointing	2001-11-08	0	0	0

No, I am not saying Titanic is a great movie, just that it is better.If you go to movies for the acting, you will also be disappointed. The dialog through much of the movie is so stinted that it takes away.If you go to movies to watch things blow up, welcome home baby. I would love to be an elitist and say this film [was terrible], but watching ships and planes blow up, Bruckheimer style, is so absolutely sweet that it is almost astonishing. This is definitely a theatre movie, as it will be hard to get as absorbed in the action on the small screen.Of course, this is no ""Saving Private Ryan"", with its gut wrenching battle scenes, but watching a camera track a bomb from a plane to the deck of a battleship is beautiful.If you are thinking about seeing this movie, and can forgive the weak plot (love triangle admist tragedy), see it on the big screen.

Williams ""gareth37"""	"The focus of this fine film is the friendship of Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker from childhood to April 1942.  Of course, you have the girl they both love--Evelyn Johnson.The events leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor and its aftermath are presented in typical Hollywood fashion with a lot of history tossed into this mix.  It appears that the reason given for the attack is a brief reference about Japan's oil supply being hampered by the United States.  The historians among us will have to comment on that aspect.The battle sequences are well done.  The ensemble cast is up to the task of presenting this well-written story.Cuba Gooding, Jr. gives the most impressive performance as Petty Officer Miller who transforms from cook to hero during the attack.  He just wanted ""respect"".  The scenes between him and his captain are outstanding.Dan Aykroyd as Captain Thurman of Naval Intelligence gives a striking portrayal of someone who knew in his gut what the Japanese were planning but could not prove it conclusively to his superiors. His comments are right on.Jon Voight as FDR gave a riveting performance.  The scene where he gets up from his wheelchair and says that America can win this war is powerful.Mako as Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Commander Minoru Genda gave a human side to the Japanese naval leaders.  Yamamoto's apt comment, ""I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant"" is a shortened version used in this film.  The complete comment was ""I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.""The music by Hans Zimmer and There You'll Be by Faith Hill are superb.  So if you want romance, friendship, tragedy and war and have 183 minutes check out the highly acclaimed Pearl Harbor."	4.0	Pearl Harbor: 60th Anniversary Commemorative Edition	2011-12-28	3	1	2

The movie seems to poke a finger at America for not becoming involved in the war sooner, after all America only came in at the end of 1941 for a war that ended in 1945 while Britain was there from 1939.  The film producer's state that they were being fair towards Japan in the movie but a total of 10 minutes in a movie of 3 hours is not long enough.The battle scene is spectacular and this is the part of the movie that really scores a good number of points. However, the love story in the movie just didn't seem to have any relevance to what was supposed to be a historical account and brings it down.  Wallace wrote Braveheart without any significant love story but crams one into Pearl Harbour, which makes it lose points.	3.0	Good movie, historically flawed but good	2001-12-31	0	0	0

It's a love story, folks, in case you didn't notice.We bought the movie after first renting it. It holds a prominent place on the bookshelves among our other prized DVDs. It contains a bit of history for our grandchildren later. It speaks to the heart and soul of those who lost a loved one in time of war.

I felt as though it could be a let down, similar to that of Titanic. However, I learnt that critics ae usually wrong.Before I sum up I must say that I am not a lover of the American race for all their faults, and war is a terrible thing, but the over-riding factor is that for a nation to drop teo atomic weapons on a country to end a struggle, is pitiful. Many people have seen pearl harobor may notice the clever use that Bay uses to show the killing of innocnet women during the conflict, but at least these kills were quick and overall far less painful than death by radioactive poisoning, and having your clothes physically burnt into your skin.This film starts off all innocent, and I don't mind the long-wait for the bombing of Pearl Harbor, due to the real-time type effect of the film. I however felt that the last hour was a wasted effort, and that it may have been more cleverly presented.However, I overall stress that this is an excellent film, and probably the second best film out this summer, only just losing out to: FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRITS WITHIN. However, this must be seen by people of all ages and backgrounds, and i'm certain that the vast majority won't be disappointed.

Laur	Some may say that 'Manos: the Hands of Fate' is the most painful moviegoing experience you'll ever come across.  I chuckle bitterly.  In my book, the coveted title of worst film ever made goes hands-down to Pearl Harbor, a movie so wretched and offensive that one would need sandpaper to scrape off the repulsive slime that it showers its petrified viewers with.Oh, I almost forgot, this monstrosity actually hit it off with lots of airheaded teens, the kind of people who turn their noses up at Kubrick movies and judge a film's substance based on the quantities of syrupy, awkward soap opera romances and idiotic explosions it contains.  These people gladly accepted the slime coating of Pearl Harbor, which is three excruciating hours of - naturally - pointless soap operas and idiotic explosions.No, it wasn't enough for these people to make their stupid airhead teen fantasy, they had to put it into a historical context in order to sucker in more unsuspecting viewers.  What the film really does is disregard the history and the fascinating intrigue behind the attacks.  The Japanese are just stereotypical evil asians and FDR is Jon Voight in pathetic makeup.  Their scenes are done sloppily and half-heartedly.  The majority of this movie is two wooden male JC penny models fighting tediously over a wooden female JC penny model.We watched this in History class.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3KMOEVKYDKEY7	G. Long	Pearl Harbor...the day that will live in infamy.  Many Americans lost their lives in the sudden attack on the Pacific Fleet, and this latest movie puts you right in the middle of it.This movie has some of the most realistic effects I've ever seen.  Titanic couldn't hold a candle to the explosions, dogfights, and overall sense of scale that Pearl Harbor displays.  When a torpedo strikes a battleship, you feel it...even if the sounds were turned off.  I can't wait until this comes out on DVD so I can crank up the surround sound!I'll admit, I was a little turned off at first from the love triangle between two best friends (who are also pilots) and a nurse, but as the movie progresses, the plot fits in very well with the Pearl Harbor tragedy.  I also think that the acting was well done.  What impressed me was that the Japanese were shown as honorable, almost apologetic during the movie.  In fact, just before the bombing, when Japanese planes flew over a few children playing on a field, you even see a Japanese yell to the children to run away.  This is a change from other movies of this type, which displayed them as evil villains.  It gives a different perspective of the events that unfolded that day.Whoever says that this movie is not aimed towards teenagers and young adults should have been in the theater where I went, because just about everyone, ages 13 and up, was crying by the end of the movie.  I nearly did so myself because my own brother passed away recently, and the close bonds between the two fighter pilots in the movie reminded me of him.Overall, Pearl Harbor is a movie that should definetly be watched.  Even if you're not into action/love movies like this, it is still a good rendition of the attack on Pearl Harbor, and like Saving Private Ryan, offers an different perspective on a major event, and it also puts into perspective just how violent and brutal it was.As I write this review, the parade that my town has every Memorial Day is gathered to remember all of those who have died serving our country, and to remember our loved ones.  I will pray for my brother, and I will also be sure to thank the valiant soldiers who died for our country during Pearl Harbor, the day that will forever live in infamy.	5.0	A good memorial to the fallen	2001-05-28	2	1	1

MARSHALL	This movie deserves a star in recognition of the work the crew put in and for nothing else.Seeing the shorts was enough for me, there was no way I would actually pay to see this movie. But tonight I watched some of it on TV and cried with laughter. Why? The storyline was dire, the acting was embarrassing and the dialogue made me think of steaming elephant excrement. It is difficult to find the words to describe how truly awful this movie is. It is worth watching only for the side splitting laughter factor and very relaxing. The only serious element is that some poor deluded fools might think that this is historically accurate. All it does is to illustrate how badly prepared and complacent the USA was in 1941. But any accuracy is totally submerged by the pure garbage that surrounds it and you would have to be mentally retarded to take any of it seriously.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1CIW2OEVAJRM2	Godly Gadfly	After being shocked by how the movie Titanic replaced historical authenticity with Hollywood, I was curious about how Pearl Harbour would treat one of the sacred events of United States history.  Unfortunately, it was not a whole lot better, and was the same formula:  A love triangle + an historically tragic event + special effects.  Like the Titanic, the first half of this movie revolves around a love triangle - this time the romance of a young war nurse with two friends competing for her love.  There are distinct overtones of the plot of Casablanca, as the one with whom she falls in love dies in a mission, and his love is replaced by his friend.  But is her first love really dead?  This all, of course, is not the story of Pearl Harbour, but a romance story where couples leap into bed with each other and do what feels good without the permanent commitments of marriage.  It is a more credible love story than that of Titanic, but immorality still features as a prominent ingredient.  And it's a story of romance which has nothing to do with history.Of course history eventually does make an appearance.  Like Titanic, the real action everyone has been waiting for finally comes in the second half of the movie with the historic events of Pearl Harbour.  These are portrayed with blinding speed and frightening realism.  The footage of the actual attack is protracted at length - I could not help but wonder if it was longer in the movie than it was in real life.  But one cannot see this without being overwhelmed by the horror of war.  For many, violence in movies functions as entertainment.  For me, it functioned to show how horrible war really and the tragic death it causes.... How realistic the portrayal of Pearl Harbour is I cannot say.  Certainly there are incredible special effects, this movie being the most expensive ever produced at the time of its production.  But in the end this isn't a movie about history, it's a movie about Hollywood, reflecting more the ideas and moral weaknesses of our current generation than the strengths of the generation that endured the reality of Pearl Harbour.  As a movie, Pearl Harbour didn't quite sink as fast as the Titanic, because it was more credible and true to its time. But in the end, like the boats in Pearl Harbour, it's still a sinking ship.	3.0	It didn&#65533;t quite sink as fast as the Titanic.	2002-03-06	1	0	1

As it is, I purposely avoided paying full price when this film was in theaters, and must have had some kind of mental breakdown to actually rent it.  There are so many different ways this movie is bad, I won't be able to list them all.  Here are a few examples:1. On the bridge of a Japanese ship, the camera zooms in on a wall calendar and shows the day &quot;Sunday&quot;...in ENGLISH!2. Army Air Force pilots were given physicals by the Navy.3. Our brave heroes dogfight in the thin freezing air above the clouds wearing Hawaiian shirts and no oxygen masks.4. These same pilots participated in the Doolittle raid.I will admit that there were a few facts that were accurate (yes, Pearl Harbor is in Hawaii).  But for each of them there were dozens that were not only false, they were offenses to the intellegence of the audience and to the memories of the brave people who were actually there.  As an historical portrayal of WWII events, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is the motion picture equivalent of &quot;Hogan's Heroes&quot;, only that series had much better acting, writing, and directing than this pathetic waste of celluliod.PLEASE, don't waste your money by buying or renting this DVD!  Instead, for the same type of experience, buy yourself a case of Hostess Ding-Dongs and stuff them down your throat until you vomit.Seriousy, I can't stress enough how bad this movie is.

It grasps the December 7th tragedy at Pearl Harbor extremely well, and the special effects are outstanding. This is my imput: If you're going for the love story, pick a different movie to satisfy you. If you're going for the historical facts and the opportunity to have a better understaning of the December 7, 1941 attacks, then &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is an excellent choice.	3.0	NOT a bad movie at all	2001-12-28	0	0	0

This was not the case.Yes, this movie wants to be an action/chick flick combination. The advantage of choosing pilots as main characters (other than the obvious heroic nation-building) is that you get to see lots of special effects and root for the good guys to try out their childhood tricks on a real enemy. The Pearl Harbor battle scene is spectacular and it is the most interesting part of the movie.The downside of choosing pilots and nurses for a movie about ""Pearl Harbor"" is that these people are simply too low on the foodchain to have any influence on the events. There are plenty of plots to be had in World War II where the screenplay is already written, but if you want to go with an average Joe story, you must come up with a plot, which the producers have indeed forgotten to do.Plots are also available wherever human emotions are in play, which does not happen in this movie, either. The neat solution of the love triangle is repulsive in a Hollywood sort of way.The way to a topic like this should have been a large ensemble cast, with at least three major storylines (one in Japan, preferably with likeable complex characters) and relatively unknown actors. Forget about the big-name stars and installing patriotism (""we will win this war because of them - volunteers give this country its strength"" etc.)and leave the plot to history.Perhaps next time around.

Tora!&quot; early in &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; - validating the comments of other reviewers about this film exploiting cliches and past cinematic successes.  As this grafting of epic romance onto dramatised history approaches its expected conclusion and the unsuspecting audience senses the end credits, the film launches into a reprise of &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot;.&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is a formula movie in which new ideas are hard to find, but who cares?  It is very entertaining and well-made.  Its tribute to the spirit of the times is largely satisfying.  It has a good cast, with the biggest names in supporting roles, including Jon Voight's portrayal of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Alec Baldwin's of Lt Colonel Doolittle, and Dan Aykroyd's of a US Navy codebreaker.  Clever market-orientated art direction and design give it a period look extending to 1940s-style brassieres-but perhaps shying clear of alienating modern tastes by going all the way with 1940s hair styles.Bonus materials in the DVD package include a &quot;making of&quot; documentary with insights into the state-of-the-art stunts and special effects.  Among the most impressive special effects is a convincing integration of computer graphics with the actual location of Pearl Harbor and with real sets, ships and aircraft.  Modern buildings are edited out frame-by-frame.  The &quot;making of&quot; documentary shows just how life-like computer-generated people, aircraft and ships have become.  The image and Dolby 5.1 sound quality are as sharp as we now should expect from every new DVD release.	4.0	&quot;Titanic&quot; meets &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; - and a few others	2002-04-26	9	7	2

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	APASOUCF2UD42	Greg Curtis	In Pearl Harbor, the infamous attack on the Amercian naval fleet in 1941 forms the backdrop for an intriguing love triangle. Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett play best friends and pilots, while Kate Beckinsale is the woman they both love.Despite the inevitable comparisons to Titanic, this historical drama -- more gritty than grand -- soars on its own. It features accomplished direction by Michael Bay, whose only miscalculation comes during the aftermath of the attack: the footage is blurred to accentuate the nurses' confusion, but good acting and editing would have sufficed. However, the attack scene alone is worth the price of admission, and it's an extraordinary feat to have outdone the impressive recreation depicted in the otherwise embarrassing Tora, Tora, Tora. The film also offers two riveting aerial battles, clever newsreel segments, stunning cinematography, and A+ sound. Hans Zimmer's score is both memorable and moving, but the theme song &quot;There You'll Be&quot; is no match for &quot;My Heart Will Go On.&quot;The script by Randall Wallace vividly captures an era of innocence and hope, and speaks of duty, determination, and courage. Though the Japanese are not portrayed as bloodthirsty villains, it leaves their motives to the history books. Unfortunately, there is an unnecessary and lengthy postscript that tries to prove America's superiority by detailing a retaliatory raid on Tokyo. Since we all know the U.S. triumphed in the end, the flag-waving should have been dispensed with -- indeed, it would have been more effective to end the film with the title assault.Ben Affleck gets top billing, but he is clearly not ready for leading-man status; some of his facial expressions are laughably bad. Kate Beckinsale, though lovely, is rather weak as the female lead, but the charming Josh Hartnett carries the film. The massive supporting cast includes the other pilots and cadre of nurses, all of whom are delightful and interesting. Dan Aykroyd, Colm Feore and Cuba Gooding Jr. shine in their supporting roles, while both Alec Baldwin and Jon Voight give Oscar-worthy efforts as Jim Doolittle and Franklin D. Roosevelt respectively.Pearl Harbor is a heart-wrenching motion picture with spectacular visuals. Suspenseful, shocking and tragic, it serves as a fitting tribute to that Day of Infamy, when a presumed Armageddon descended on paradise. Rating: 8 out of 10.	4.0	Spectacular	2004-12-31	2	0	2

It's a shame that Hollywood feels that 99% of the films that come out today must contain some kind of soap opera setting to satisfy what they think the lady folks wish to see. I find that to be rather insulting to women and I am not a female. There is nothing romantic about December 7,1941. It gets 1 star for the actual attack sequence. I must mention that I highly doubt that while they flew  over head, the Japanese pilots were signaling to the American children to take cover. Silliness.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1FY8NNI6PLI4Z	Gunny Mac	In my opinion, Pearl Harbor was a poor film.  The movie is way too long and can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a love story or a war movie.  On both counts, it fails.  The dialogue is corny and Ben Affleck is so annoying with his country accent.  The film just doesn't seem to have much connectedness.  It feels more like a bunch of disjointed subplots.  One moment its about the relationship between Affleck, Beckinsale and the other guy, the next moment its about Cuba Gooding Jr., next moment it focuses on the president and the pressing matters that he must deal with.  Since there is no virtually no interaction between these separate character stories, shifting the focus and point of view between them is just a bad idea.  Although the love triangle is the backbone of the movie, it fails to hold up the rest of the film and is simply cliched and uninteresting.  The attack on Pearl Harbor itself had good special effects and was done well enough, but in this day and age with the sinking ship in Titanic and the graphic battle scenes of Saving Private Ryan, its not all that spectacular.  When it gets right down to it, Pearl Harbor does not reflect any sort of good storytelling or creativity.  It is a film that simply tries to cash in on the WWII fad while throwing in a formulaic love story, obligatory political correctness and big budget special effects.  It will defiitely make tons of money initially but it will not have any lasting effect and will not be remembered as a great film.	2.0	Another big budget Hollywood disaster	2001-05-28	11	8	3

I found it more interesting to ponder the male-male bonding, however; are we viewers supposed to detect some homoeroticism?But the real strengths of this movie are 1) the battle scenes and 2) the three-strip Technicolor. This was the last movie ever made  in Technicolor; one must see the colors to believe them. Brilliant blues and greens (and yellows and oranges!) jump startingly off the screen at the viewer.

The performances in the film, particularly of Ms. Beckinsale, are right on target. The soundtrack is excellent. True, the movie DID play loose with history (the real reason behind the attack, etc) but it's Hollywood, what the hell did you expect, for Christ's sake? My favorite scene is the one where Danny (Josh Hartnett; it just happens to be my real name, by the way; what a coincidence) and Evelyn (the lovely Ms. Kate Beckinsale) are in the parachute hangar. I wish that the scene had been more sensual, but it's good as it is. Erotic without being explicit. The sound quality is AMAZING. It enhances the experience even more. Look out for cameos by Alec Baldwin, Dan Akroyd, Academy Award winners Jon Voight, Cuba Gooding, Jr and others. I don't understand why people hate this movie; did they expect Hollywood to stick to facts? You rarely get that from them.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1TRZJ87N7TWC8	"""hangoverfive"""	The visual impact of the attack is without a doubt an amazing achievement, but the storyline of this movie is painful and amateurish. I appreciate the idea of doing an old fashioned movie, but emulating the style of the classic war movie does not mean trudging out every cliche of the genre without some creative revision.  If you want to see a quaint revision of the old style war movie, rent Memphis Belle.This movie is more like the cast of Friends facing the ravages of War.  I almost gave up on this movie only 20 minutes into it, but I was able to hold on until the attack on Pearl Harbor.  While that scene is clearly stunning, I should have quit before putting in disc 2 (why the director didn't also quit then is a mystery to me).War movies need a human side, but few movies artfully integrate this with the images of war.  Saving Private Ryan, which also stunned audiences with its realism, was far from perfect, the typical Speilberg morality play left the Germans without much of a face and tugged a bit too hard on the hearstrings, but at least the characters came across as more genuine and the story avoided the worst of the soap opera plot devices.Its a shame this movie couldn't take a simpler approach to examining the war's impact on humanity.  As it stands, the movie is a lot like the Titanic epic; it's long on visual detail short on subtle human revelations.	2.0	Amazing effects, agonizing screenplay	2002-01-16	2	1	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A37DLVPKJZGSQF	Hannibal	I was a little unsure of Pearl Harbor. I had eagerly awaited it myself, but when the bad reviews poured in from American critics, I thought maybe the NZ premiere wouldn't please. But, I was wrong. I really enjoyed this film. The battle sequences are some of the best ever filmed, the acting is top-notch, the sound is booming and vibrating and the direction is focused and careful, Pearl Harbor is easily Michael Bay's best effort. The romantic triangle is sometimes corny and predictable, and the first hour is lacking in excitement. But, that all changes in the last 2 hours, which are incredibly tense and utterly brilliant. Pearl Harbor is a movie that forces you to stay in your seat for as long as the 3 hours take, and is a powerful and unique war experience. I really liked the comedy at the start, but slowly and surely, the comic side of the film turned to dramatic atmosphere. The film was able to change its genres surprisingly and unexpectedly, giving you the odd laugh and the expected tear. If I was ever to watch this movie again, I would probably fast-forward the first hour and get to the superb action scenes, but the first hour is needed to give the film its intelligence. So, even if this film is flawed and sometimes inaccurate, it's still nothing short of a must-see.	4.0	Powerful drama in a fantastic war story.	2001-06-06	4	1	3

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A29PXAWU8VTNWW	"""hcampo"""	PEARL HARBOR is unfortunately typical of the majority of today's motion pictures: ALL CONCEPT AND NO CONTENT!All the digital technology in the world cannot make up for the fact that there is not one moment of genuine humanity in this badly written, loud, overblown, overlong and poorly acted travesty of a movie.The two best films about Pearl Harbor remain TORA! TORA! TORA! (1970), for its accurate depiction of the events leading up to the attack on both sides plus brilliant (even by today's standards) special effects and FROM HERE TO ETERNITY (1953) for its superior story, which despite the restrictions of the film code at the time, has richly drawn flesh and blood characterizations, people you actually can care about instead of the cardboard cut-out ones you couldn't care less about in PEARL HARBOR.Save your nine bucks and rent one of these two far superior films unless all you care about is seeing the courage and heroism of America's World War II servicemen reduced to the indignity of titular planes crashing and ships being blown up, most of which look like images that belong more in a video game than in a multi million dollar motion picture.	1.0	PEARL HARBOR: ALL CONCEPT, NO CONTENT	2001-05-24	31	21	10

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2WFB7J96P2CIW	Hector	Let's be honest, this movie was dumped on by critics.  Granted, the film may have concentrated too much on a love story more than Pearl Harbor itself but it is still epic.  Michael Bay has done a tremendous job with this film.  He has kept the history of Pearl Harbor as accurate as possible, giving to us the attack with astounding visuals due to unlimited technology.  The dialogue could have been better but Bay tried to keep the story as it was happening during the 1940's.  COME ON!  There was love, there were brothers together in the military, best friends with a difficult relationship, it HAPPENED at least ONCE, lets not forget that.  Moving on to the DVD.  This is the ULTIMATE DVD EXPERIENCE!  I have never seen such a beautiful construction in my hands before.  First of all, you get what's coming to you, the Director's Cut.  FINALLY, an R-Rated version, the way Pearl Harbor was intended to be seen.  We can't blame Bay for releasing a PG-13 version because it was the studio's demand that he do that since it cost over $100 million to make WHICH MAKES SENSE!  You want all the audience you can get!  But anyway, this cut is a lot better, less love story, more gore:The scene with Danny and Evelyn talking in the care is gone, as well as Rafe burning the letters from Evelyn as well as their conversation afterwards near the end of the film.  We get more dialogue from Colonel James Doolittle and the other sailors as they prepare for the raid on Japan.  Of course, we get much more graphic in the attack of Pearl Harbor, a young man's severed head, men's bodies spinning out of control due to the bullets and explosions, etc.  In a specific scene when Cuba Gooding Junior's charater comes to the Captain's aid you see him holding his intestines; you notice when the men are hit by non stop bullets above, Bay makes it more graphic with blood.  There is also more swearing in this version as well.  Bay has given us the film with over 60 new shots and he got the job done.  The picture is outstanding of course, the 5.1 Dolby Digital Soundtrack is spectacular, NOT TO MENTION THE NEW HEADPHONE SOUNDTRACK THEY PUT!  NOW YOU CAN PUT ANY SET OF HEADPHONE INTO YOUR TV AND LISTEN TO 5.1 SURROUND AND FEEL LIKE YOU ARE IN A ROOM SURROUNDED BY SPEAKERS, ALL IN A LITTLE PAIR OF HEADPHONES!  It is incredible.  3 audio commentaries which gives a total of over 9 hours of commentary!  You get Michael Bay with his professor if I remember correctly, Jerry Bruckheimer, Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck and Alec Baldwin( I still wonder why they didn't have Kate Beckinsale in the commentary) and the third consists of other filmakers as well as the movie's composer and I can tell that the musical score is STUPENDOUS!  That is the first two discs containing the movie, not to mention some hidden Easter Eggs such as a Letterbox introduction and a Gag Reel which is hilarious.  Starting on Disc Two you get the original features from the first DVD, Journey to the Screen, Music Video and a preview of National Geographic (The History channel documentary that came in the first DVD comes in Disc Three with a new Documentary).  You get the theatrical trailors as well.  Then you come to all your glory, mini documentaries with commentaries, behind the scenes footage, film backgrounds, Super 8 montage with unused footage, etc(the third and fourth disc) etc.  You get Deconstructing Descontruction conversation with Michael Bay and other filmakers, a segment which gives you the complete attack sequence in three angles: the movie, behind the set as it was happaning, and storyboards in preparation for the scene.  You can watch just angel, or all three at the same moment, not too mention you have over seven audio tracks, three of them with commentaries, and the others you can have just the movie soundtrack, just the music, or the special effects.  And you have you poster concepts, Art Gallery full of photos.  There is plenty of history documentaries with a distinguished timeline with unlimited resources.  I have not even finished seeing all of the features yet.  It is endless!  OVER 12 HOURS total of non stop entertainment!  Not too mention the DVD's packaging with a little booklet giving details of the DVD's features as well as four collectible postcards contained within this cool belt in the package with the colorful poster pictures that were out when the film was released.  IN the end, an OUTSTANDING DVD.  Michael Bay receives 10 STARS for this DVD release, I must say they really put an EFFORT into this edition...  Bottom line, ALL THE CHEERS FOR MICHAEL, THE CAST, AND CREW AND EVERYONE ELSE INVOLVED FOR A JOB WELL DONE!	5.0	OUTSTANDING DIRECTOR'S CUT!	2002-07-05	6	3	3

This movie espouses heroism and made me proud to be called an American. It also made me feel sad that my generation is probably unready to deal with such a horrific event like WWII like people of my grandparents age were. Who cares if there was a love story added to it. Are you telling me that people didn't fall in love back then or do not get romantically involved during war? It IS a movie after all, and if you look at it purely from the point of filmaking, it is a great film. It may not be historically accurate, but since when is it Hollywoods job to educate? People need to stop complaining about this and go out and read books or take college courses on history. At the movies, just watch the film. And watch this one because it is great on every level.	5.0	Excellent movie about American Heroics	2001-06-12	1	0	1

It seemed like it dragged on forever and ever. I don't do the long synopsis of movies but I will say this. The story was supposed to revolve around these characters during the attack on Pearl Harbor. That much they got. But I didn't care about the characters, the development really stunk. I found myself rooting for the Japanese pilots, a la MST3K. Drivel doesn't even begin to cover it. The costuming was done well, and the props in the sets well selected, but that's about the only good thing I can say for this movie. Watch it once.

Maybe their overdoing of everything was to appeal to a younger generation of movie-goers, but this epic is executed like an over-budgeted music video.  Why oh why didn't Jerry Bruckheimer make this movie like Black Hawk Down (which had some of the same actors and a similar 'military tragedy' plotline).

He seems like as good an actor as any other, and seems likeable to boot.The story was tragic, or at minimum, very sad, but totally believable.  The girl transferring her affections to the best friend seems completely natural, and I'm sure it's happened countless times.  The once-thought-dead lover turning up to be alive after all, is something that has no doubt happened, and surely throws everyone involved for a complete loss as to how to deal with it.All in all, it's a fantastic film, and a thoroughly enjoyable experience to watch.Let the Negative Numbskulls wallow in their pitiful no-ness, while the rest of us enjoy first-rate entertainment, at bargain Amazon prices."	5.0	The Nay-sayers have just got to say something.	2011-08-30	6	1	5

Ben Affleck sold me on the idea that he was a 'hot-shot' pilot (sort of like the Tom Cruise character in 'Top Gun', also produced by Jerry Bruckheimer). The British Beckinsale pulled off being an American girl very well. The special effects used in the re-creation of the December 7 attack were breathtakingly realistic.The love stories do lack some spark, but they're by no means bad. The historical tale will be compelling to young people just learning about WWII. The bonus documentaries are top shelf. It is definitely worth your attention.	4.0	History - Sanitized, but Pretty Good	2001-12-09	0	0	0

As previously stated the romance was inept and ridiculous. The behavior of the main characters made me dislike all three of them. But I was drawn to the movie because I am a war buff so I won't dwell on the romance.First of all what are the chances that Ben Afflecks character Volunteered for and fought in the battle of Britain, got shot down behind enemy lines [what was he doing there it was the Battle of BRITAIN?], almost died but was smuggled out by partisans, came back to Pearl (why in the world would the Army send him all the way back to Pearl Harbor to recover) just in time for the Japanese attack, Then fly there against the Japanese. And it doesn't end there he then is hand picked by Doolittle to fly the famous raid on Tokyo where he crashlands in China and wins a firefight (with a handgun) against seasoned Japanese infantry (with rifles and certainly no slouches at the time). Why not keep going? He could have fought in the battle of Midway, then arrive at Guadalcanal just as Henderson field opened, later D-day then the Battle of the Bulge then maybe he could have  dropped the Bomb on Hiroshima. Why would a fighter pilot be picked for a bombing mission they had plenty of well trained B-25 pilots at the time? Does the Army send all of your friends and flight crew and super mechanic with you when you get transfered to a top secret carrier mission? A bit too far fetched for me.Ok Now this Mechanic. He has a radio that can talk to anything anytime, wow. I'm no WW2 communications expert but I am pretty sure they did not have that capability. Then while he carried  the radio and a large machine gun up ten flights of stairs he kept full communication with the pilots and his crew on the ground! He arrives at the top of the tower just in time to get off a sweet deflection shot just as the Zero happened to be going by. I won't comment about the game of chicken, just think about it please. Oh and they used the dud bomb thats not a dud twice, tsk tsk.Historically accurate?  The big picture maybe, but there were so many farcicle details that I felt it took away from what really happened there it wasn't a drama it was a disaster. Not any less of a disaster than 9/11.Now I have to say some thing nice. The special effects make this movie worth seeing once, but don't buy it. Rent it or wait for it to come on tv.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2MMIZ653FBNPT	Ian Creamer	It's virtually impossible for me to find any reasons to recommend this movie.Okay maybe the special effects during the main battle scene are pretty good.It's about the only aspect of this film that is in any way good.The other 2:30 minutes were a clich&eacute;d bore.I mean how good actors took on this film having read a dreadful script is beyond me.The dialogue is stunted and pretty awful.The characters are all paper thin and the love triangle story is even thinner then that!The only actor to come out with his reputation held in tact is Cuba Gooding Junior-and even he's stereo-typed beyond belief.At least he adds a touch of humour in comparison to the wetness of the other main characters.As for the historical contexts and inventions and stuff-well I don't have a real problem with this-I mean when has Hollywood ever paid due regard to historical facts?The fact that the producers felt they needed an American victory of sorts for the viewer to celebrate is just so predictable-I mean why did they call this movie Pearl Harbor when most of the action takes place with the pilots as children or the years subsequent to this terrible attack when they gained some measure of revenge.I had to say that this was the most disappointing film of the year!	1.0	Just  &quot;Plane&quot; Awful!	2002-01-08	10	6	4
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2ICW5OUWX2A2V	Ian	Okay folks we have a winner for the most dissapointing film of all time.  This is beyond bad, In fact, I was more entertained watching Battlefield Earth!  No matter what I write here this movie will get globs of cash, go to the academy awards, win dozens of awards and become an instant classic.  I was so excited when I puchased my ticket at 11:00 in the morning, going in and waiting a half hour and anxiously watching the exciting previews. (Man,Jurrasic Park III looks cool) and I anxiously watched as the title &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; appeared on screen.  Three hours later I trudged out of the theater, disgusted and angry beyond belief.  The previews for this film were well done and made the film look 10 times more exciting then it really is.  Instead of a smash bang, action flick with lots of explosions, sinking ships and heroic tributes we have a very bad, very boring love film that deserves to be obliterated.  In fact here is the basic plot of what happens. Love,love,love,love,love,love,love,love,love,short 5 minute plane fight,love,love,love,love,love,love,love,love,love,love,Really short and unsatisfying 30 minute attack sequence, love,love,love,love,dollite raid,love,love,love,end. Believe it or not, that is all this film has to offer in the course of 3 hours.  There is enough romance in this film for 10 movies, the characters will leave their lover for 2 minutes and then meet and make love again and again for over 1 hour.  The attack sequence itself is the biggest ripoff of all.  Remember that really cool sequence in the previews where the camera is behind the bomb as it falls twords the Arizona?  That is a big ripoff.  Wee, we get to see a small boom and the bow go up, wee,yay.  The special effects are OK but this is really bad, it just dosent capture you like the fantastic Titanic did.  Even when men die just inches from the surface trapped in the upside down battleship its very bad.  There is however 1 spark of light.  The best sequence in the entire movie is whent the Oklahoma flips over, now that is good stuff!  The acting is very boring and bad.  The best actor in the entire film is a little doggie who rolls a ball around when the bombs start falling, the second best actor is another dog, who heroically leaps out of his dead owners arms and swims to saftey.  The best human actor is a priest who gives last rights and comforts a dying man.  Overall this just dosent add up.  My advice is to wait untill it comes out and speed through 90 minutes of film for the mediocre attack.  Otherwise ignore it like the plauge, or go see Tora,Tora,Tora! At least it dosent have a obscene love story.The Good: The Oklahoma capsizeing sequence, the 2 dogs and the priests actingThe bad: little carachter developmentAnd the ugly: Everything else, the bad attack, the acting, everything	1.0	Bad, really really bad.	2001-06-04	23	17	6

Nowhere compares to Rose and Leo.2) Terrible acting3) Overdramatic- slow motion should be outlawed4) A SLLLOOW beginning5) Cannot relate to charactersThe ONLY reason I gave it 2 stars is for the special effects; they are actually quite good. But that's it. Don't waste your money.	2.0	Titanic-Wannabee	2002-07-16	4	2	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2I21X2I5Z0RIH	Inti college	Well, i have guessed that many would say that this film is boring, not romantic, unbelievable .... etc. Maybe, everyone has different idea about the film and different expectation before watching it. For me,its cost - 150 million dollars attracted me.  After watching it, then i realize that the film included romantic love and friendship apart from the war part. The story among the 3 actors touched me. Well, maybe some will think that the love in the film was not romantic as the &quot; boyfriend&quot; is always changing, but for me, the film successfully showed the reality -- real life never ask what we want. For Rafe, he saved his life becoz of Evelyn, but when he came back , everything changes.. it was hard for him to accept this reality; But for Evelyn and Danny, they thought that Rafe died, so they were not giulty together -- everyone has to live.  And did u realize that in the story, both Rafe and Danny experienced the similar incident: Initially, Danny lost a best, really best friend, and after that he met one who he loves the most , but after that he have to leave his gf again(dead) , but for Rafe, initially he lost his gf, but at last he lost his best friend. Finally, he with love with the one he loves again. The mechanism among this 3 actors, that is one of the characteristic of this movie.  Besides, i'm glad that in this movie , there was no prejudice for both countries. Japanese fought for survival, US fought for reputation ....  After watching 3 times in the cinema, i thanked for the actor/actress and Micheal Bay for producing this movie, a historical movie that is not bored, but romantic and touching. Well , for those who expect the movie to be purely historical or praising soldiers .... i would encourage him/her to watch documentaries .......	5.0	Why not Pearl Harbor ??!!	2001-06-14	9	5	4

A ""Private Ryan"" this isn&#8217;t. First of all,in my opinion there was way to much of a love story.The special effects were GREAT! Especially that Big bomb where the camera followed the Bomb right down the stack of the ""Arizona""(may they all rest in peace)I thik the movie could have been more action or build up to the action rather tan 1/3 of the movie being a love story. The other thing I thought was strange,was what looked like the immediate flight & atack of the ""Doolittle Raiders"" This did not take place until ""133"" days after the attack of Pearl Harbor.All in all; I thought the movie was good but not great.If Tora,Tora,Tora was made with todays technology,(please excuse the punn)it would have blown ""Pearl Harbor"" out of the water.I am a WW11 movie fan.I have just about every movie or documntory of Pearl Harbor or movies around that space in time. For some reason, the movie makers who made most of the WW11 movies made us(being the powers to be & subordinates) make us seem like bumbling ... when it came to planning & anticipating our enemies moves & our own.I know we had our share of military blunders but the movie makers at that time made it look worse than it was.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3LP5RUMWG7GQ0	I. Westray	"...The writing in Pearl Harbor just plain stinks.Early on in this movie, there's an expository scene involving the Japanese high command. They're planning the attack, and they've got a problem -- torpedos won't run in waters as shallow as Pearl's. So, this group of military planners go out to a public park to consider things. (We know it's a public park, because there's a family in the distance flying a kite.) First they consider some wooden fins designed to make the torpedos run shallower -- a real historical detail! Then they stand around a sort of huge plannnig board. On one side of the diagram is a line drawing of a torpedo. It's a picture you might have drawn in third grade: a long tube with fins on one end. From the nose of the torpedo, this diagram has an arrow. The arrow goes down under some wavy lines -- water, again drawn as a child might illustrate it -- and it points to the side of a ship. Ooooh, those dastardly Japanese, they've got a trick up their sleeves... ""Okay,"" say the planners, ""that may just work -- let's go."" And by this time, I'm wondering: aren't they going to have to have those kids with the kite killed later? This ""plan"" isn't much of a secret -- American spies may just have smoked that torpedos were for sinking ships by 1941 or even earlier -- but for the sake of the plot, aren't we supposed to think it's all pretty hush hush? Why is it taking place in this sunny park?But don't worry, this movie is so dumb, you'll stop worrying about things like that. It's also offensive. His military advisors stumped by the dire situation after Pearl, FDR lurches to his feet, admonishing his people that if HE can stand, THEY can plan a daring raid. Anyone with any sense of what Roosevelt was like, of the spirit FDR showed in living with the effects of his polio, will cringe at that scene. I had just read Doris Kearns Goodwin's popular biography of FDR and Eleanor during the way, and I found it humiliating to watch that.One could go on. Let's just say this is the sort of movie where, when one of the Japanese soldiers gets shot with a pistol, he dies immediately. When a good guy gets hit, it takes ten rifle shots to bring him down, and then he lies on the ground, gasping out his last farewells while all his buddies -- suddenly oblivious to the swarming Japanese patrols they've been running through for five minutes -- gather to listen. What a crock. Don't even ask how they got that coffin back at the end, okay?This movie was half an hour of unrealistic digital effects -- planes banking impossibly with their wings half an inch above the tarmac, and so on -- with two and a half hours of atrociously bad writing around them. The love story was trite and dull. The digital effects just keep getting bigger without ever convincing you of anything. You could write a pretty decent scene about two lovers looking at a monogrammed napkin from the Queen Mary and talking about their futures together; here we get a digital version of the ship itself, stupendous in scale, and it means nothing.Um, it's pretty dang bad."	2.0	Mediocre and Worse and Worse	2002-05-15	9	6	3

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A34A095NNHFMB5	Jack Felson	"And now, ladies and gentlemen, let me present you one of the most pitiful big movies in these last years. A complete disaster. And a disgrace.As soon as he starts shooting, Michael Bay takes the wrong direction: the title of his film is supposed to show us the wheels of the U.S. navy based in the Pacific. Instead we see some young, fanatized American boys playing heroes in army plane cockpits. When we see what's gonna happen to them next, this scene is nothing but laughable and useless and Bay could have done without it. After that we have nothing but sentimental, sugar scenes, lasting at least three long quarters until the Japanese come in with their planes. The film really takes off only at this moment.Actually the Japanese attack on the Pearl Harbor base, which is the pretext for Bay and his technicians, to take a huge delight in action and special effects - the bombings were shot in the same place than James Cameron's ""Titanic"" - is there only to save a frankly foolish and unsignificant love story (a young nurse, pretty, devoted but real common, falls in love with two cute G.I.s; one of them sinks into the sea but comes back, in one piece and in top form - how can he do it? -, the other one gets killed in the end and everything turns out OK) we don't believe in for a single second. The movie is worth watching only for the long scenes of destruction of the U.S. navy, even if the heroism is truly base. But what can be the most unpleasant in this film is the attitude of the American high-ranking officers who, after the Japanese attack, launch out into a bloody vendetta. We all know what'll be next: the United States enter the war and follow the Pacific battle (see ""The thin red Line"" a much, much better movie), the beaching in Normandy (without even warning), and of course, the atomic bombs on Japan. This after-""Pearl Harbor"" is explored by Bay the lousiest way but shows and tells us much about American soldiers, who think they have the status of gods nobody has the right to attack.How could Hollywood be able to show so much despise, such a lack of respect to the memory of all the soldiers and civilian people who died during the bombings? Only for the purpose of big money - the film was a huge success -? And how could talentful screenwriter Randall Wallace (author of ""Braveheart"") get involved in a project like this? That is the main questions we have the right to ask to ourselves... About the actors, if gloomy Josh Hartnett (seen later in ""Black Hawk Down"") is very convincing and happens to be the only good point of the film, Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale are so simple that they turn out desperating and Cuba Gooding Jr., Tom Sizemore and Alec Baldwin don't belong in there. ""Pearl Harbor"" is the kind of luxurious daub, desperately syrupy, with a window violence, to be urgently kept from a good distance. Instead watch again ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" from Richard Fleischer (and Kurosawa) which, with the same story, avoids any lousy sentimentality, or see ""The thin red Line"" over and over again."	1.0	Ridiculous and shameful movie - the disaster of the year	2003-07-05	6	4	2

No, this is not exactly a &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, however it is still a great movie (Even though there are a few flaws). Because of mis-leading promotion, I think it may have lead some people to believe that this movie would be straight-forward action, similiar to &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. If you are the type of person who only like action movies without any type of drama, then you probably won't like it (There is plenty of action in it). However, if you don't mind a little drama, I think you will enjoy it as much as I did. If you aren't the latter though, still give this movie a try. You might like it. I certainly enjoyed it.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2HRT3AZA2YCDP	James E Geoffrey II	Let this be said at the outset, Touchstone Pictures' &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; will not go down in cinematic history as the greatest film ever made.  There are points of corny dialogue, as an actual history it is a disaster, and at some of its most crucial moments, the story suddenly goes oddly flat.  Yet, in spite of its obvious shortcomings, it works reasonably well as an evocation of how the nation saw itself seeing itself, as well as providing some undeniably spectacular special effects and a love story that is better than the critics have made it out to be.The story is fairly straightforward.  Two boys who grew up together as best friends fascinated by the daring-do of the World War I air aces, join the Army Air Corps on the eve of World War II.  The older man, Rafe (Ben Affleck), is cocky, self-assured, and eager to be a hero.  The younger man, Danny (Josh Hartnett), is sensitive, somewhat shy, and was presumably traumatized by his father's emotional breakdown after fighting in the trenches of France during the Great War. When Rafe joins the Eagle Squadron, a British unit for American volunteer pilots, and is subsequently presumed killed in action, Danny first comforts, and then falls in love with, Rafe's girlfriend, a Navy nurse named Evelyn - played by the lovely Kate Beckinsale.  On the eve of the Pearl Harbor attack, Rafe returns - it transpires that he had been rescued by a French fishing boat and was hiding out in occupied France - causing a love triangle that is interrupted by the Japanese attack.  In the end, Rafe and Danny reconcile just before both participate in the April, 1942 Dollittle raid on Tokyo, with Evelyn waiting back at Pearl to find out if her men will make it home from the mission.The critics have said that the portrayal of the attack is the strongest part of the film and that the love story is dispensable.  Actually, the reverse is true.  For a student of history, the &quot;historical&quot; aspects of the film are either inaccurate, incomplete, or simply false.  Speaking as a Washington, DC area resident, it is unclear why the local audience did not break out in giggles when the Navy Department building that appears on screen is actually the House side of the U.S. Capitol.  (One wag called it the Navy Department's House of Representatives annex.)  The battle scenes, though indisputably gripping, are almost too glitzy, with Japanese and American warplanes performing tactics best suited to Star Wars X-wing fighters, and at least one shot with 1990's vintage aircraft carriers being included in a &quot;fleet at sea&quot; scene.  This is mostly good visual stuff, but for anyone with a little historical knowledge, it is distracting.  (One big exception - the sequence showing the capsizing of USS Oklahoma is very well done.)The love story, on the other hand, has all of the feel of a 1943 vintage romance and war movie.  Somewhat hokey and a little overwought, but nevertheless compelling.  The viewer gets a feel not so much for the times themseleves, but for the cinema at a time when Americans went to the movies both for entertainment and for reaffirmation.  The movie evokes the world as it was in 1941 as viewed through the prism of moviegoers during the war and its immediate aftermath.  It is a mixture of innocence, foreboding, nostalgia and cliche.To be certain, sometimes the story falls flat.  Although Affleck, Beckinsale and Harnett all put in good performances, they do not have enough time - even in a three hour movie - to convey all the information that the viewer needs to be fully engaged with the characters.  (The novel that came out with the movie fills in many gaps.)  Also, the scene where Evelyn sees Rafe alive for the first time is oddly muted.  Evelyn is shocked at first, but moves straight to confusion over her feelings for both Rafe and Danny.  The expected intervening step - joy at seeing Rafe alive - never transpires, making the whole scene seem an anti-climax.Also, the movie never makes explicit that although Evelyn loves Danny, Rafe is her true love.  Instead, she is made to seem that she is not making a choice, thereby draining some of the dramatic oxygen.  Nor does it clearly explain on what basis Rafe and Danny seem to reconcile, instead there is a scene in which both characters seem to go from wary antagonism to renewed affection in a split second. (Again, the book clarifies much.)One other peculiar aspect of the movie is its rather grim tone - surprising in a summer movie.  Although Wallace and Bay work tirelessly to bring out themes of pride and patriotism, they never fully succeed.  It is just too hard to look at wrecked battleships and shattered corpses to feel all that good.  Even the end sequences, which are emotionally the most powerful - and arguably the best dramatice scenes - in the movie, do not create feelings of patriotism so much as a sense of wistfulness.  The audience feels happy for the characters, but it is mixed with a sense of loss.  This will probably be effective with older audiences, but may lack the emotional lift that the under 30 crowd seems to require of its movies.Notwithstanding these weaknesses, the &quot;period&quot; feel of the movie works.  The viewer gets a glimpse of movies circa 1943.  Oddly, &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!,&quot;  which is an outstanding and historically more accurate movie, fails to deliver in this category - the characters in that movie could as easily be in 2001 as 1941.  (As to those critics who complain that &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is not about Pearl Harbor, you probably name your cats, Kitty, and your dogs, Spot.)As to the performances, almost all the cast perform well, if not always up to their finest earlier work.  Affleck is convincing as the cocky pilot, and his sequences with Beckinsale demonstrate the same kind of restrained, and for that seemingly more authentic, emotion as he showed as the cocky ad agent in &quot;Bounce.&quot;  (Though, overall, he is better in &quot;Bounce.&quot;)  Beckinsale is gorgeous in 1940's vintage attire and hairstyle and brings off even the most cliched lines - and she gets her fair share - with a naturalness that makes them acceptable to 21st century audiences.  Hartnett has the toughest job as the introspective Danny in a cast of very prominent characters, but pulls it off to remarkable effect.As to Cuba Gooding Jr., Dan Akroyd, Jon Voight, Alec Baldwin and the rest of the cast, all do creditable work.  The one exception is the Japanese actor, Mako, whose Admiral Yamamoto is played without the subtlety that Soh Yamamura brought to the role in &quot;Tora!, Tora!, Tora!.&quot;  An occassional physical gesture, such as shaking his head with regret when he delivers the obligatory -for Pearl Harbor movies - &quot;sleeping giant&quot; line, might have made his character seem more real.  Instead, each line is delivered as if Yamamoto was reading a cue card.  (NOTE to the subtitle writer: It's &quot;The rise OR fall of our empire...&quot; not, &quot;The rise AND fall of our empire...&quot;)Taken together, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is not the strongest movie, but its feelings are real and it definitely taps into the anxiety, harshness,beauty, courage, and heroism that Americans equate with the movies of that period.  That probably accounts for &quot;Pearl Harbor's&quot; bad reviews.  The critics, and unfortunately probably most younger audiences, want an action story or a love story, and cannot relate very much to, or empathize with, evocations of a world long since past and that seems, in retrospect, pitiably naive.  That is sad, but less for the talented and underapprecited cast and crew of &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; than for the viewers who will see it.	3.0	A Date that will Live in Nostalgia	2001-09-06	11	9	2

A triangle of lovers set against the Japanese attack which pulled America into World War II. Kate Beckinsale is a nurse torn between Ben Affleck and his friend, Josh Hartnett. Both are pilots. When Affleck is presumed killed in Europe, Josh gets Kate pregnant. Affeck returns, and the two men clash in Hawaii. The attack on Pearl Harbor is emotional and drawn out. After Josh is killed in a raid on Japan, Affleck marries Kate and raises her son. There is no mention of the atomic bomb, which I considered an omission. The events of 9/11 occurred just months after the release of Pearl Harbor, making George Bush responsible for the global conflict of the 21st century.

I have studied the battle at &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; and &quot;Midway&quot;, and this movie will be the blockbuster of 2001.  The producers and directors of this movie have brought the public very outstanding movies over the last 10 years (search for the producers, who brought &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; and &quot;Armageddon&quot;).  Even though some feel this movie will take away from the historic meaning behind the battle, I feel the movie will bring back the feeling of hate and sorrow towards every angle of World War II.  This movie will be the ground for every historical movie made after this summer.	5.0	A Time We Shall Never Forget	2001-05-25	8	2	6

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1QD6HNK4CLDU3	Jamey Shaw	The movie itself was a little mushy, almost like Titanic.  Just like Titanic, the movie was centered around a love story.  Don't get me wrong, the movie was awesome, with some of the best effects I have ever seen in a movie.  The love story was an unnecessary part that just added to the 3 hour movie.  Also, after the attack on Pearl Harbor the movie goes on into some other raid over Japan, which was kind of long.  It was good, you just expected that the movie was over after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  The attack itself is about 40 minutes long with unbelievable special effects.  I would recommend that you go see it.	4.0	Great Special Effects!	2001-05-30	2	2	0

Most people (including some of my friends) would still say no because of the cheesy first half and the cheesy ending. But the movie actually balanced itself out. This movie doesnt have Academy Award Winning acting, but what do you expect from Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnet, and Kate Beckinsale? Their not the top of the notch, but the bigger actors knew with Bruckheimer (who doesnt look for a storyline, but would rather give some special effects in place of the story) and Bay (who has done some of the worst movies in recent memory) they wouldnt get a balanced out movie...but for once they were all suprised, like me. The ironic thing is the two ""twists"" (if you can call them that) where Affleck dies, comes back, then Hartnet dies, end of movie. This team cannot keep a secret about the main basis from the public. Three days before Pearl Harbor was released, I read on Amazon about the ending, totally spoiling the whole movie...I thought. Then I watched it and realized that anyone who sees this movie, figures the ending midways through the film. Not really much special features, unless you buy the Vista Series Directors Cut (which isnt worth $[money]). But for an okay movie to watch, thats historically accurate (atlead the first half), then check it out. If you havent seen it, dont be in no rush, the 2-disc should be down to $[money] by the time they release fifty diffrent versions of the film and DVD."	3.0	Suprisingly Fair For Michael Bay & Jerry Bruckheimer!	2002-06-26	3	0	3

I am only writing today because I feel so strongly about this movie.Unless you want to watch some cheesy love story, do not get this movie. Instead, just watch history channel, it is much better. I truly felt I was watching Top Gun, and every sickening love story ever on the big screen. The only cool parts were those of the diesel engines, and Pres. Roosevelt getting out of chair by himself. No wait, falling in love with someone over a 2-day period, and then sleeping with his friend is pretty cool too. Other than that, I can't tell you how horrible this movie was.	1.0	ARE YOU KIDDING ME?	2001-12-17	5	1	4
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A32VXN061CEHZ3	Jason Mosqueda	I know alot of ppl have said that they didnt like this movie, and hey thats them. I for one loved it. I'm in the Marines, I serve my country with great honor and pride. Just as those of did during WWII. This movie makes you feel proud to be an American cause when terror struck us from afar we did not go down quitely. We rose up as a nation to fight a evil that chose to tempt us, just as the events the events have on September 11, 2001. This movie shows that America as nation will pull together in a time of need, we will fight to the death to protect our family, friends and loved ones.Like I said its a great movie, long but one worth buying. Every great movie has its faults, as this one did. The battle sence's are not as long as I had hoped, but they are awsome. It would have been nice if they could have shown the bomb drop and how Japan surrendered, and how we defeted Germany and won but that would have made the movie so long. All in all its just as good as any other war movie.	4.0	Great Movie	2001-11-17	6	3	3
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2ZWTA18X37QOZ	"Jason Oey ""UltramarineX"""	"**Warning: A few spoilers**When I saw the first trailer for Pearl Harbor back in late 2000, I thought that it looked damn cool, and it would be one of the movies that I planned to see in the summer of 2001. But, for some reason (I forget exactly why), I never saw it when it was out in theatres. I also never bothered to rent it when it came out on Video/DVD. I guess this is due in part to many of my friends saying it was a bad movie, although a few did say they liked it. I swore that one of these days I would see Pearl Harbor, and decide for myself whether it deserved all of its negative/positive reviews. Now, three years after it was released I caught it on cable TV while flipping through the channels. And what did I think of it? Pearl Harbor sacrifices strong character development for special effects, and becomes a movie that is at best average.Let me start off by talking about the high points of the movie, the battle scenes. The computer animated fighter planes were well done, and seeing waves of Japanese Zero fighters flying over Pearl Harbor was just plain cool. The attack on Pearl Harbor, as depicted by the movie, is chock full of explosions, guns ablazing, and well-choreographed dogfights. It's the only sequence in the movie that held my attention for any length of time, but I would expect no less from a director like Michael Bay. His resume of movies makes him well suited to vividly rendering tremendous scenes of carnage. Yet, at the same time as I thought how cool the special effects were, I realized that this was a weakness too.The battle scenes in this movie, specifically the Pearl Harbor attack, are not something that should make us say ""Yo! That's so cool how the Arizona blew up!"" These battle scenes should make us focus on how horrible the attack was, and it hindsight, the attack on Pearl Harbor in this movie looked more like a scene from Independence Day, but replaces the alien and jet fighters with World War II era craft. The American planes unrealistically fly only a few feet above the ground, while strafing the Japanese fighters. I couldn't help but feel that this was dishonoring the memory of those who died in the attack.The characters seemed more like a second thought in this movie, taking a back seat to the battle scenes. The dialogue was often very corny, and the acting itself was pretty stilted on the whole. I've lost count as to how many times Capt. Rafe McCawley (played by Ben Affleck) tells Nurse Evelyn Johnson (played by Kate Beckinsale) she's so beautiful. One would think she would get the point after the first five times. Their romance (and her eventual romance to Josh Harnett's character) looks too forced, as if they are supposed to fall in love simply to advance the plot and nothing else. This movie also, prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, attempts to sledgehammer the point that you are supposed to feel sorry for all the soldiers and civilians. They show tons of scenes of giggling young women, happy-go-lucky men having a beer, and several cheap love scenes. What I don't think director Michael Bay realizes is that since we know about the tragedy to come, there is no need to take such a heavy-handed and redundant approach. Bay appears to think otherwise, and has to constantly reinforce the idea that ""you must feel sorry for these people.""Lastly, there are a couple scenes in Pearl Harbor that I have to talk about. The first is the scene during the attack when Capt. Danny Walker (Josh Harnett's character) radios that ""I think World War II just started."" When he said that my eyebrows were drawn together, and my hands clenched into a fist. World War II did not start at Pearl Harbor! Countries like Britain, France, and Canada were fighting the Nazis, and the Chinese were fighting the Japanese before Pearl Harbor happened.The second scene would be during the Jimmy Doolittle raid on a Japanese industrial area. One thing that I (and other critics) noticed was that there were very few Japanese civilians that could be seen in the area. And once the bombs dropped, we saw buildings being blown up, but no screaming Japanese civilians. This is probably because the filmmakers did not want to put too much of a damper on the movie, by making the audience realize that Americans bombed civilians too.I will admit that I did feel a LITTLE sadness when everybody thought Affleck's character died in Europe, and when Harnett's character died at the end. Other than that, Pearl Harbor the movie is entirely forgettable. My recommendation is that if you want to see a war movie with great drama (and no cheesy love story), coupled with great action scenes, go see Saving Private Ryan (1998). If you want to see a more historically accurate depiction of the Pearl Harbor attack that has little cheesy dialogue, and shows what happened on both sides, go see Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970). Tora! Tora! Tora! has special effects that still hold up even today despite its age, and in my opinion, is a much better film than this 21st century Pearl Harbor movie.I give Pearl Harbor movie a 6 out of 10."	3.0	I saw it once...and will probably never see it again	2004-08-17	0	0	0

No one was sure whether they would ever see each other again so life was, shall I say, lived to the fullest.Many people fell in and out of love several times due to death or loss of a partner.Of course this movie plays an old angle, have the best friend fall in love with the girl when the first goes missing.....well we all know it happened and still happens. You could probably find several stories from wartime veterans of just such an occurrance.The action part? well, it goes without saying, afterall this is a war film and even though the film isn't riddled with war footage, there is plenty to keep the average person entertained.There was also enough of a break between combat sequences; from the British Air Force footage to the Doolittle Raid with the attack on Pearl Harbor right in the middle; that I never got overly tired of watching things blow up.Historically everything that occurred during the actual combat footage happened.I have read and heard some say that Cuba Gooding Jr.'s appearnace was only to fill the void of no Black actors. This just isn't so....Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays a real-life hero of World War II, the first black man to win the Navy Cross.The woman too were portrayed accurately. They may be there because they thought it would be exciting and they would meet men, but when they are needed, they are strong, brave, and dedicated.Of course as with almost all war movies, there is bound to be inaccuracies. Screenplay writers and dirctors both know that if you follow history to the letter you have a documentary, not a story everyone can enjoy.It could also be mentioned that the portrayal of the Japanese was probably softened somewhat. Political correctness virtually prohibits writers from telling the truth of how brutal the enemy was at the time. Even though Japan is one of our greatest Allies of present day, they were our enemy 60 years ago...But this movie is reminiscent of many past war movies. Filling all the needs of romance, action, and (hopefully) accuracy.By the way: I had my parents watch this movie with me. My Dad was stationed in the Pacific right after the war started and my Mom worked at an army Fort in the states.

Conrad Guest"""	"For the most part, Pearl Harbor holds true to the actual events of that fateful day in 1941, but unfortunately the historical depiction takes a back seat to the typical love triangle that seems to be in fashion these days, as if, like Titanic, the historical recreation of a story to which most viewers already know the ending must have something of interest to draw people to the box office.Although the battle sequences of the actual attack on Ford Island are spectacular and seamless, I found laughable the idea that Ben Afleck and Josh Hartnett not only single-handedly drove off the first wave of Japanese warplanes, but also managed to find time to make it to one of the on-base hospitals to donate a couple of pints of blood for the wounded before dashing off to end their hectic day on the hull of the Arizona, assisting with the rescue efforts. Whew! I'm glad these guys were on our side!Alas, the film doesn't quite know what it is: a documentary of a ""day that will live in infamy"", or a sappy love story set against a backdrop of WW II. Many WW II war buffs, not to mention veterans, will be disappointed, despite the film's accuracy; but then, this segment of the movie-going market is dwindling. Pearl Harbor seems geared toward young people who swoon over the two male co-stars and watch to find out which one wins the girl, with nary a care that the men who fought and died in this battle and all of the battles in WW II helped shape the world in the second half of the 20th century as well as the early part of the 21st century. For my money, Saving Private Ryan, although the story's premise was purely fiction, was a much better film because it more accurately depicted the horrors of war.Four stars for the attempt to accurately depict the events leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor, but overall, one star for relegating our parent's 9/11 to the background of a tacky love triangle."	1.0	Shot Down Over Pearl Harbor	2002-06-24	14	5	9

It has been way under rated and bad mouthed by people who havent even seen it! It's a movie thats about two best mates Rafe(BEN)and Danny(JOSH), they are two mates that have grown up together and looked out for each other thru everything!! They pretty much treat each other as brothers, as we find out! The story which i think we all know about PEARL HARBOR in some way or another, is about of cause the bombing of PEARL HARBOUR on December 7th 1941, when the Japanese thought of there sneakie and sly ideas of how to bomb PEARL. The bombing sceans are magnificent! There is of cause a romance, this is between the three main stars.(not giving away in detail in case you havent seen it) The sad twists that happen that you wouldnt think would happen, the amazingly real flying that the boys get up to. The feeling like you are there when the attack happens on the air bases, and the hospital. The scared feelings you get when the Japs fly over Pearl for the first time. In there hundredes!!! The feelings you get when the Americans dont face up to there mistakes, and dont listen to the people that know what they are talking about, instead they listen to the high class generals who dont think about the fact they would bomb where they are lest expecting it! This is when you feel like you are involved right in there with them and fighting this war with them! Yes this movie might take the win off Japan, but, it is a American movie and goes into deeper detail as well not just focus on the Japs, but the Americans and there way to get back on them and destroy there lives like the Japs destroyed theres! The romance link between people and the way the americans delt with defeat and strugling there way back! So all you people who havent seen it and are bad mouthing this SPECTATULAR movie do yourself a favour, buy this movie! You wont be sad you did!

Given the length of this movie (about three hours), I see that the movie is more about how the events affected the key players in the film.The attack on Pearl Harbor doesn't happen for quite some time.  The focus is on two friends.  An argument could be made that the nurse is also part of the focus, but given the childhood background, I would maintain that it is just the two friends.The movie shows us their love of flying and their close friendship.  We see them come close, and we see the beginnings of WWII separate them.  The attack will bring them together, and we will watch the events after the attack draw them together.  To be honest, this movie is a bit too long for a buddy movie.This movie would be more effective if it were divided into a buddy movie, a love story, a movie about Pearl Harbor (I think Cuba Gooding, Jr. should have had more scenes for his character.), and a movie about the bombing of Tokyo.

Burk	The first 90 minutes of Pearl Harbor is an irritating attempt to recapture the same kind of audience of adolescent girls who propelled Titanic to becoming the highest-grossing film of all-time. The last 90 minutes is almost pure action. The great thing about a DVD is you can skip over the fluff and tune in where the Japanese pilots prepare to climb into their planes. Building up the suspense of the impending attack, as wave after wave of aircraft launch from the decks of their carriers and head toward Battleship Row, is extremely well done. The heroics of the main characters are a little hokey, particularly in a battle everybody already knows is lost, but you root for them anyway our of sheer patriotism.

Although it was much better on the big screen, I still enjoyed the video version.  The actual historical timeline was acurately followed, and the actual attack itself was by far the best part of the film.  I was happy to see that when the Arizona was hit, it was done correctly with the bomb penetrating the forward magazine instead of the myth of the bomb going down the smokestack.  Perhaps the best part of the movie was the capsizing of the Oklahoma.  I also enjoyed the Eagle Squadron scenes from England.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	ATS1HA5M3EPZ4	"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile"""	When was the last time you went to a Cineplex to see a documentary?  I'm guessing you never did.  In turn, no one should take a movie seriously as far as historical facts go.  A movie should be seen for what it is, a movie, entertainment.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.  The fact that this one centers around the battle of Pearl Harbor is just a set piece.  Braveheart, an excellent, Oscar winning movie, had more historical inaccuracies then Pearl Harbor, but everyone accepted it.  The problem was the hype.  Media is to blame for the tremendous hype of this movie and in turn it raises expectations.  I kept my expectations low and I was not disappointed.  Not that keeping low expectations was the only way to enjoy this movie though.  Pearl Harbor has heart and it goes for the bravado throughout the movie.  It begins with the childhood friendship of two main characters, eventually played by Harnett and Affleck when they are shown as young men.  Both are pilots in the Army.  This is a time when displays of patriotism and courage were more important then your welfare, and men gladly died fighting for their country.  The two young men are more then anxious to fight, Afflecks character in particular who has Dyslexia (although back then it was fairly unknown) has to charm his way through the medical exam, being given by Beckinsale.  The pilot and young nurse start a romance that is very strong, Affleck and Beckinsale surprisingly have tremendous chemistry together, and the innocent yearning for one another is very apparent.  Affleck's character is then offered a chance to fight in England.  He accepts and as he goes into dogfights over the war torn battlefields of England, an inevitable tragedy happens.  To say anymore might ruin some of the story.  What follows is sadness at the loss of a friend, new romance, a surprise scene where we learn that Affleck's character is not dead (although we all saw it coming), then the scene that everyone is waiting for; the attack on Pearl Harbor.  The initial setup of the love story is pleasantly appealing, it is humorous, sweet, endearing and never too sappy.  It is well paced and does not get boring.  In my own opinion, Michael Bay is a very skilled director.  He has the makings of another James Cameron but something is still missing from his process.  He is a perfectionist as well, but Cameron has him beat hands down when it comes to balancing a love a story with hard core action.  Bay still does a very fine job here though.  He handles the love story with enough emotion and then throws us into the thick of this tremendous battle scene.  Not enough can be said about this scene.  Bay pulls out all the stops and makes sure we realize the scope of the power and destruction that was rained on this island base burns into our memory.  The camera that follows the bomb from the sky and into the bulkhead of the Arizona, followed by its eventual explosion as it lifts off the surface of the water is spectacular and frightening.  The long battle scene never lets up.  It keeps going until we feel as exhausted as the soldiers who suffered through it.  After this comes reconciliation of sorts.  Affleck and Harnett's characters have to get over certain personal issues.  The raid on Tokyo follows, with Baldwin playing Jimmy Doolittle (and he plays it well), the hard core army pilot who leads the bombing.  The wrap up is emotional, there is not a customary happy ending.  It isn't a shock, but it plays well against the backdrop of the war, and the love story that has played out in front of it.  The Japanese are not portrayed poorly, they are seen as people in a desperate situation.  The Americans at the time had cut off many of their resources.  The bombing was a last resort and the Japanese are depicted as hesitant to awake the sleeping American giant, especially the Japanese General who coordinated the attack due to the fact that he was educated in America and knows what they are capable of.  The reasons for the attack are stated and justified (at least by standards of war).  The statements made by Franklin D Roosevelt are inspiring and well portrayed by Jon Voight, still a great actor and hardly recognizable in the makeup.  He brings fire to the role of FDR and makes it known that he is the President at all times.  Cuba Gooding Jr. plays the black cook on board one of the ships that was attacked and plays his role for everything it has, seeing as it is such a small role.  He plays a real life Navy cook who took up an anti aircraft gun and shot down one of the Japanese planes.  Some may say his role was short and not necessary to the movie, but I disagree.  He was a man who took up the fight when the country wouldn't let him.  Instead of showing bitterness, he displayed his patriotism for a country that scorned him.  In that he shows that the fight to save lives became more important at the time then the bigotry of the country he was fighting for.  When all that this movie has to say has finally been said and done, we should know that history should not be learned from a movie, and even though Pearl Harbor has only a few inconsistencies in it's historical portrayal, the interest it may spark should lead people to look up the actual events in legitimate historical archives, or to watch The History Channel, to get the real facts.  In all, the movie fully deserves four stars.  Michael Bay made a tremendous effort here to show what he can handle as far the content of a movie and he succeeded on many levels.  I give it four stars only because there is still something missing that keeps this movie from being exceptional.  However, it is a very good movie and I would sincerely give it my recommendation.	4.0	What do people expect...?	2001-09-03	0	0	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A33Y98IV0C4CYZ	Jennifer Brown	The secret to enjoying Pearl Harbor is to go in with very little expectations...that's what I did and I found myself pleasantly surprised.  I thought this movie would be awful because it was made by Michael Bay and Ben Afflek (who came together to do the worst movie ever--Armageddon) but the acting wasn't bad (but please stop giving Afflek southern accents) Kate Beckinsale is a much better actress than her counterpart in Armageddon, Liv Tyler.  They did the best they could at attempting to have Evelyn fall in love with both of the male stars and look believable.  This movie can be separated into 3 acts: Evelyn falling in love with Raef and Danny, the attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent attack by the Americans Act I gets 3 stars for being too long Act II gets 4 stars for it's breathtaking special effects Act III gets 2 stars cause it seemed as though they just threw in whatever ending they could find. Room for improvements: more Cuba Gooding Jr.(I almost forgot he was in the movie) have the Japanese look more like humans rather than heartless stone-cold fighting machines, more history/less story This was your typical Hollywood fare, but can be enjoyable.	3.0	Much Better Than Expected	2001-05-28	0	0	0

The acting of Kate Beckinsale is a lot more polished than Kate Winslet's performance in Titanic, if you ask me.  And two of the hottest actors star in this 3 hour film, so what more could you ask?My friends cried buckets when we went to see this in the theater.  Of course we all expect tragedy from this movie - I mean, look at the title!  And some of you may be sick of those sappy endings, morals, and whatever, but I think this movie worked it in pretty well.  The plot incorporated humor and action to spice up the old love triangle - people have said that this movie could have ended in ten different places, but it just kept dragging on.  ...That is kinda true, but we can't just leave the story at the handicap of Pearl Harbor, right?  And the love thing still had to be settled....Well, Titanic never had the entire audience satisfied either...give Pearl Harbor a try and see for yourself.

Not romantic-sad, sad as in 'pathetic.'If you want to see a good movie about Pearl Harbor, check out &quot;Tora, Tora, Tora.&quot;  This flick comes across as pure fiction, and is largely unbelievable.  I think one of the ending scenes defines its lack of realism.  Two aviators are being captured by the Japanese.  One aviator is tied up, while his buddy manages to shoot three Japanese, and kill two with a grenade.  Meanwhile, the tied-up guy is shot through the chest multiple times.  Of course, the dying buddy is strong enough to keep kicking until he gives his farewell speech, while the Japanese are all instantly stone-cold dead.Besides, this movie would have been about an hour shorter if it didn't show an American flag every five seconds.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	ATVW8IF4482DM	"Jesse D. Hamm ""jessehamm124"""	"ARGH!!!! I hated this movie!Like many who have come before, I have long-since considered the 1978-miniseries ""Pearl"" to forever represent the perpetual rock bottom in the history of Pearl Harbor-related cinema.  Alas, the events of May 21, 2001 have proven me dead wrong.As a 1920's flit of childhood mischief depicts two Tennessee farm boys in the process of taking daddy's crop duster up for an unauthorized spin, the premonitions of what follows become readily apparent, as we flash-forward 20 years as the dreaded war-clouds are  steadily gathering with frightening ferocity.Needless to say, the heroics that follow engender a generous contortion of the trademark rule that ""in the movies, anything can happen.""  Therefore, just as surely as an army of spear-equipped, undersized teddy bears can overpower the Imperial Storm Troopers, a duet of farm-bred white trash can easily outfly the most proficient ranks in the Luftwaffe and Imperial Japanese Navy.  However, this does by no means render the cheesy assortment of macho heroism any more forgivable, nor the sheer essence of redneckiness that pervades every inch of our two protagonists(Hartnett and Affleck) any less repulsive.Sweat-doused and greasy, these two inert specimens of farm-raised white bread seem fresh from an overnight excursion at the local outhouse, not to mention a good year or two removed from their latest shower.  Needless to say, Hartnett and Affleck are a little too cut-out for their hillbilliesque alter egos for their own good, as the two compliment every inch of their sleazy mannerisms with thick, ugly southern drawls.While, realistically, it's plain to see that these two lame-brained home fries wouldn't last two seconds in the Air Corps' flight training program, the film attempts to suspend enough disbelief with which to neatly deposit our all-American heroes among the ranks of newly-commission fighter pilots in the USAAF.  Given that the year is 1940, worldwide tension still prevails and a pervading sense of conscience will lead many to heed calls of duty overseas.Thus, Affleck becomes the next ""Yank in the RAF"", honing his skills in the Battle of Britain until a wily Messerchmitt pilot perforates his Spitfire into a metallic mass of swiss cheese, thereafter committing him to an untimely plunge into the English Channel and a misdiagnosed ""KIA""-status to boot.Predictably, Hartnett's efforts to console the bereaved girlfriend (Kate Beckinsale) quickly trancend into an untimely romance, further complicated by the Honolulu-based arrival of Affleck, who's none too enthused as to the aftermath of the year-long chain-of-events that have transpired since his own disappearance.As surely as ""boys will be boys""(particularly the uneducated redneck variety), the increasingly-bitter verbal confrontation quickly escalates into an all-out free-for-all, whereby the faces of these all-American heroes incur a long-overdue decoration of scars and abrasions.  Fortunately, the date just so happens to be December 6, 1941.  Thus, we can rest assured that the events of the following morning will inevitably infuse our heroes with the necessary resolve with which to put their differences aside and make the meatballs pay for their dastardly deeds.Call me on my propensity for nitpicking, but the sheer number of technical inaccuracies in this flick drove me absolutely out of my mind, being the World War II-buff that I am.For instance, consider a scene in which Affleck instructs his fellow aviators into the futility of attempting to ""outrun Zeros"".1)  Given that the performance virtues of the Misubishi A6M catered to the category of maneuverability rather than speed, the proper terminology in this case would necessitate replacement of the word  ""outrun"" with ""outturn"", and...2) Considering that U.S. Forces had yet to confront the Zero in combat, how the hell would this inept redneck have any familiarity with its flight characteristics?Technical shortcomings aside, the filmmakers themselves are no more proficient at tackling the political spectrum, as indicated by a watered-down assessment of the Japanese motivations for attacking Pearl Harbor.  According to the movie, the attack in question amounted to nothing more than bitter retribution for America's ""unjust"" material embargo as imposed at the former half of 1941.  Thus, the incentive of the filmmakers to omit any and all references to the Japanese Army's brutal rampage throughout China or the oppression of the Korean people appears to amount to nothing more than lame-brained attempts to appeaseJapan's recently-revived nationalistic sentiments.Before long, it becomes readily apparent that Bay and Bruckheimer's primary source of information on World War II happens to have been derived from too many hours on the Playstation.  Battle scenes are staged with thick layers of pyrotechnics but little insight into the realities of warfare, while the dogfights themselves incorporate little more than a repetitious series of horizontal scissors, culminating in an eventual spewing of smoke and earthward plunge as an aircraft is finally hit.But, enough of that.  Back to the ""story"".As coincidence would have it, the personal relationship of our white-bread duo with Jimmy Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) have enabled a sufficient succession of pulled-strings with which to allow Hartnett and Affleck to take part in the Tokyo raid of April 18, 1942.  Predictably, only one of our boys is destined to survive this attack, thereby instigating a prompt and fitting resolution to the ongoing love triangle, once and for all.As a hero's welcome pays tribute to the Doolittle Raiders, a voiceover from Beckinsale recounts that after the raid in question, ""America would know nothing but victory.""  As much as I hate to divert the attention of the filmmakers from a pretentious moment of self-styled reflection, I will be so bold to point out that Corregidor wasn't captured until May 6, a good three weeks after the Tokyo raid.But, even if the above assertion was accurate, who really cares?"	1.0	Praise the Lord and pass the cliches	2005-04-15	13	7	6
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A33WTE48QA55N2	Jesse Gill	Although being liked by most, I found Peral Harbor to be a boring movie.  Besides it being 3 hours 8 minutes long, its story was very very thin.  A sappy friendship/love story during the whole first hour of this movie is only a preview of how drawn-out this movie truly will be.  Only when the most increadible bombing sceen starts, it is well worth it.  Being only 15, I came only to see this part. A long sceen in itself, it should only be witnessed in a theater.  The movie is a failed attempt to put story into something with no story. Take my advise, you could still enjoy the movie if you were about an hour late.  Also, we spent the whole first hour wondering when Matt Damon was gonna show up, which he didn't; and dissapointed us.  Ben Who?-ffleck should stick to doing more comedy roles; such as Jay and Silent Bob Strick Back.	3.0	The Tragity of Peral Harbor (the movie, that is...)	2001-05-28	3	1	2

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3MO2Z33K82ROJ	Jessica	.... What it is is a time capsule of that period. My grandfather was at Pearl Harbor when it got bombed, it is truly amazing to see it in action since he never talks about it. Everything in this movie was good...Ben Affleck does a great job, Kate Beckinsale is torn between two guys that love her, and in the end she is stuck (you have to watch it) with Josh Hartnett, the innocent one. You have to watch the movie to understand the so called &quot;love triangle&quot;, it was 3 months after Rafe (Affleck) had been killed or missing or whatever and Danny (Hartnett) and Evelyn (Beckinsale) hadn't seen eachother. Rafe is what brought them together, she was just calling out to someone because she was hurting, and so was he.  The bombing scene is very emotional, the most emotional point in the movie. It's very well directed and put together.  This movie shows how innocent, egotisical, and highly we rated ourselves, and how it all came down at Pearl Harbor. I've seen this movie twice and I'd see it again in a second. If you don't respect history don't see this movie, but if you respect it and respect the people back then, go see it. Yes, some of the lines may be kindof cheesy, but think about Titanic, look how many times they said eachother's names in that one.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2QUXIWBTAXBGO	Jessica Nocerini	How quickly we are willing to criticize something that we did not create, a work of art belonging to another--but isn&#65533;t that human nature? To judge a book by it&#65533;s cover, a musician by a single song, and a person by his or her appearance. And didn&#65533;t we do the same for Pearl Harbor? Didn&#65533;t we, the public, see the posters, read the reviews, and then spurn the epic tale off as another Titanic? Yes, I was reluctant to see the movie. I didn&#65533;t want to sit in the movie theater for three hours, and I didn&#65533;t care to see another war movie. But Pearl Harbor turned out to be so much more. How can you say you hated the movie, when saying that makes it sound like you hate a part of our history as Americans? The movie inspired such a feeling of patriotism and allegiance in me that the American flag is now something more than just a piece of fabric--it is a symbol of what our country fought for, what our soldiers died for. I cannot believe the apathetic, unconcerned public when it comes to this movie. They read the critic&#65533;s reviews, and like the lemmings that they are, did not care to form their own opinions of the film. They only sat back and let the film take a plunge in box office sales. Yes, it had beautiful movie stars in the leading roles--but I ask you, what movie doesn&#65533;t? And yes, the story was a love story--but wasn&#65533;t Titanic? And yes, the beginning is a little bit slow and each character is introduced--but if they weren&#65533;t, would we really care if they got killed during the bombing a little further into the film? Pearl Harbor is the most moving, heart-rending film I have ever seen. I cried throughout the movie, ashamed at myself for never realizing what those unsuspecting people went through that terrible morning almost sixty years ago. I&#65533;m still ashamed that I could have so much apathy toward America&#65533;s history, as inaccurate as some may say it was in Pearl Harbor. But, really, don&#65533;t all &#65533;historical&#65533; movies have some kind of inexactitude?  If they didn&#65533;t, they would be a documentary--rather than a fictional--film. Every actor in Pearl Harbor is talented beyond belief. Kate Beckinsale, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Josh Hartnett, Jon Voight, Dan Aykroyd, Ben Affleck, James King, Tom Sizemore, Alec Baldwin, and the thousands of extras helped to bring the movie alive. I admire all of them for standing tall even when the public tried to shoot them down. It is my belief that every movie you see touches you in some way, and changes our existence in ways that we don&#65533;t always notice right away. They change our entire outlook on life, making us more sensitive and changing our goals and convictions. Pearl Harbor is one of these life-changing films--it made me a better person in numerous ways, through intensity and patriotism, through awareness and realization. God bless the cast, Jerry Bruckheimer, and Michael Bay for making me more humble and finally showing me, even with all the glitz and computer imagery, that I should be forever proud of my country.	5.0	A Work of Art, Made To Be Admired--Not Criticized	2001-08-28	13	5	8

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2SHS1A50G2RP0	Jessica Taylor	This is the greatest movie ever made. True, much of it is clich&eacute; and sentimental, but as for me, I like that kind of movie. The story isn't exactly the most accurate of history films and so I would not advise seeing this movie for the history. This is a very romantic movie that centers on true love. The story opens on two young boys growing up together in post-depression Tennessee. These two young boys are later introduced as Rafe and Danny, best friends since childhood. The movie then speeds up to 1940, where Rafe has found the love of his life, the beautiful and coy nurse Evelyn, and he and Danny are training to become pilots in the army. Matters between Danny, Rafe and Evelyn become more complicated when Rafe's request to be stationed in England is granted.As I said, this is a great movie for all of you romance-lovers. About 1 hour centers on the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and the special effects are magnificent. If you ask me, I think this is a much better and well-put together movie than Titanic.	5.0	The Greatest Movie Ever Made!	2002-03-24	0	0	0

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1G7NIRU8QR7MW	J.Flood	I'll start off with the positives about this movie. The special effects are very good, and the actual Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour is edge of the seat stuff! The battleships, planes, army/navy uniforms seem to be correct for the time, also.However, the whole 'love story' part of the movie is a big let down. I've no problem with combining romance into a war movie. If it is done properly, it can help with the character development in the storyline. In this case though the 'romance' aspect was horrendous, unwieldly and unconvincing.Another gripe I have is that the dialogue between the main characters is at best poor, and at times absolutely cringeworthy!! Worse still, it just doesn't ring true for the era!!For me the best part of the movie, was the Doolittle Raid, towards the end of the movie, which was portayed very well. However, a lot of people watching the film, may have never heard of this raid, so would be left scratching their heads at its significance.Five stars for the CGI, zero for the acting. So, two stars, overall, is about right.	2.0	Disappointing!	2009-03-12	4	2	2

The movie version is a hollywood-imitized discrace. My first and biggest problem is that the movie is about fighter pilots. That's cool, but what about the sailors? This is their storyline, not two hotshot fighter pilots. I think the movie should have been told from a sailor point of view (Cuba Gooding's 5 minuite part doesn't count). Also, the movie is about 40 minutes too long. If you are going to make a bad movie, at least make it a short bad movie. Don't make us sift through 2 1/2 hours of (...) so we can see twenty minutes of the battle. Unless you are a real war enthusiest or were there for the actual attack, don't even bother with this.	2.0	Should have, could have, wasn't	2001-11-29	1	1	0

I watched this movie not thinking about who directed it, or who produced it. I watched it to see the movie. The movie is very well put together. Out of the whole 3 hours I wasnt the slightest bit bored, and if it werent for the love story I know that I wouldnt have been able to sit through it.

I was 4 years old when Pearl Harbor happened.  My best friend's sister was an Army nurse who fell in love with an Army officer.  They served together in the Pacific.  He was killed.  Love stories do happen in war.  Complications do arise.  The romance was needed relief from the never ending pounding effects of the war.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1XSXUBCNFIM3W	Jim Jr	Much has been made of historical inaccuracies in this film, but what a viewer should consider is whether they want to be entertained or given a history lesson. There are wonderful documenteries that will give the &quot;true&quot; story, this film is aimed at being an entertainment with a historical background and on that level it is tremendously successful. In a program on the History Channel, &quot;History VS Hollywood&quot;, two historians pointed out the flaws, but came to the conclusion that it is basically &quot;history&quot;. If nothing else the film illustrates an important event that many in today's audiences really do not know anything about. For this reason alone, it is an important film.Critics have been hard on the love story that takes up the opening section. This part of the film is really necessary as it puts a human face on the horrible attack and the subsequent bomber raid on Japan. Yes, it is a typical &quot;lovers seperated by war, brought together by tragedy&quot; script, but it is very well done. Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett are excellent and moving as the three caught in a situation they never wanted. Their story is much more involving and believable than the romance that James Cameron forced on &quot;Titanic&quot;.A number of actors who usually star in other films are used to advantage in smaller roles. Alec Baldwin is an excellent &quot;Jimmy Doolittle&quot;. It is amazing that on a recent talk show, the host, in her late 30s, did not know who Doolittle was (an example of why this film is important in bringing history to the younger audiences). Jon Voight is a wonderful President Roosevelt. Cuba Gooding, Jr. in a very small, but important role, is a standout. He is a wonderful example of the statement that &quot;there are no small roles, only small actors&quot;. He completely dominates the screen in his brief appearances.The action sequences are truly breathtaking. The visuals are wonderful and the sound is marvelous.I was 6 when Pearl Harbor happened and can still remember that day. I, of course, did not understand what it meant and could not understand the reactions of the adults around me. So Pearl Harbor is something I have always known about. For the younger audeinces, it should be required viewing simply to introduce them to a vital piece of history. Fictionalizing parts of the story only make it more appealing to the general audiences and critics who find fault with this really lose sight of the bigger idea.This is a film that I can not wait to own on DVD.	5.0	Excellent Film Even With Flaws	2001-05-28	4	4	0

Sure it has a mooshy romance sub-plot, repeat sub-plot but it still has it's marcho guy war stuff in there as well. Plus I really liked the performances, especially Josh Hertnett who steals the show from Afflick. The one perfomance that I think deserves oscar consideration though is John Voight, he was so good that you would think he was Anthony Hopkins in this movie. He really deserves it, even if you didn't like the movie I doubt you could disagree.I found the war scenes that most people called cartoonish very engaging and well done. The only bad things are that it's too long, the whole love triangle thing is predictible and it trys too hard to be dramatic. Oh yeah plus Cuba Gooding Jr. is pretty much playing the same role he had in Men of Honor.  Other than that I was really into this film and had trouble seeing where it was actually......bad.	3.0	Bad ?	2001-12-05	3	1	2

Lee ""dash2k4"""	Produced by the same team that made my favorite Armageddon, I was interested to see how the two would compare. It was a good movie on its own, but I felt it had too little to do with the war except that the people in the movie happened to be on the receiving end of the bombs. It reminded me of Titanic, with a better plot (both are love stories, Pearl gets a little more into the stuff outside of love). The initial parts are very entertaining, with humor sprinkled here and there, as it was in Armageddon, and is done just right to keep things interesting and not too serious. However, the end was rather weak. I won't spoil it for you; suffice it to say, it looked like the producer had no way to close off the movie, so it just ended. Some parts of the movie felt unnecessary (Cuba's role could have been left out and wouldn't have made a difference, in my opinion; he's just so disconnected from the other characters). Mr. Roosevelt... seemed rather inconsistent. He'd be a courageous leader in one, an impatient decision maker in another... wait, never mind, that's how politicians are. To close off my rant, the movie was something like a 3.5-star affair, but i always round up. I'm sure people will enjoy the movie, and I myself can watch it a couple of times more, but it's not something that i'd bring to a deserted island (those would be armageddon, gladiator... maybe even lion king).	4.0	not quite armageddon, but a treat nonetheless	2001-12-06	2	0	2

I'm 15, which yeah I'm gullible for the next big movie. I finally saw it, and I was disappointed.This movie isn't about the Pearl Harbor incident, it's about a love triangle that took place during the Pearl Harbor incident. Pearl Harbor was a sad time in America's history, so why make a 3-hour movie about two best friends who fall for the same girl, then back it up with the Pearl Harbor incident? Many people died that day; it was horrible; yet the film-makers here didn't seem to be inspired by the history. I was more interested in the history than the generic love story, but the movie didn't give much insight. This movie is a love story/action flick with no inspiration for that tragic day.The dialogue of Yamamoto and the other Japanese were pathetic. They seemed to recite a play rather than conversing with each other. Another glitch is that they were victorious that day, yet they're shown in this movie without a single smile. Just what in the hell is that?I rate this movie 2 stars. It is one of the worst movies I've seen this year. Some good points? Passable acting and nice special effects. The rest of the movie could've been so much more. This isn't the right movie to coincide with Memorial Day.	2.0	Not what I was expecting	2001-05-28	5	3	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1SV7CVBLB5XD6	Joanmare	Over all Pearl Harbor is an exciting war/love epic which will move you to tears. It has masive action plus a twisted love triangle which will draw the viewer(s) in! For all you guys, there are tons of blood and dead bodies EVERYWHERE. Bombs explode... people get blown up... and Michael Bay does a great job directing the film (There is also a short love scene that you might be interested in seeing). And for all the girls, there are romantic scenes which will make you cry and use up a box of tissue(you'll finish the box and many more). Pearl Harbor is a wonderful and astonishing love story with flying guts and blood(dramatic/action film)! Besides the great storyline the actors are the best. Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are soooo HOTT in the movie! As for Kate Beckinsale, she's pretty and she'll make you wish you were in love like her character in the movie. The costumes were amazing and the movie will have you glued to your seat(even if it's 3 hours long). I was shocked, myself, that it didn't get nominated for a golden globe or an academy award! The time was worth it and a part of me even thinks it was too short. The plot was great and Pearl Harbor would make an excellent book!!!!

I, for one, loved it and have seen it half a dozen times lately.... and as long as this movie is, that should be saying a lot.  The hype that surrounded this film, will probably be what brings it down... like most movies that get such high publicity upon release.This story is all about friendship, love, and war... and what happens when they all mix up.  When the two friends innocently fall for the same woman... you know the sparks will fly... but what happens when two friends fall for the same woman and war is occuring all around them?  Regardless of what is going around you... life will go on, and emotions will be high.It's touching... and at the end you can't help but feel some sadness and some happiness at the same time.	5.0	Loved it!!!	2002-01-31	1	0	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3KUUII2GSHN7T	"Joel Munyon ""Joel Munyon"""	"They sucked us in with the initial trailer, a movie preview that only slightly hinted any kind of romantic sequence. It was packed with an intense track by Hans Zimmer and a total focus on the short battle scenes.  But, after watching this film, I was left thinking, ""why couldn't the Japs have killed Affleck and Hartnett?""  I should have known, though, seeing very clearly that both Hartnett and Affleck would be starring in this war version of Runaway Bride.This is a chick flick disguised as a war film. The film spends 3/4 of itself focusing on a love triangle, and my, my, it just happens to be the love triangle from hell. It's a very unmerciful slap in the face to all those men who fought in World War 2, and those who tragically gave their lives at the real Pearl Harbor. But what's a little dishonor towards American war vets if it means some big bucks for Hollywood, right? Please, people, please.This wasn't even comparable to From Here to Eternity, a film that was known as a chick flick from the get-go. With Pearl Harbor, we are tricked into thinking this movie was going to be a war film, which it cleary is not. If you expect a war film on the same lines as Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, or even The Thin Red Line, this film is not for you. If you do, however, enjoy You've Got Mail set under the tones of a war film, this will certainly float your boat(pun intended)."	1.0	Oh my gosh!

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1QW78X9BGBZ16	Joe Lockard	There is very good reason that today's modern-day movie theatre has gigantic screens and state-of-the-art surround sound systems: movies like this one.  Pearl Harbor makes Titanic look like a fender-bender. And then there is the sound. Oh, good God. For anyone who likes vintage aircraft or even engines in general, the sound generated by the planes in this flick is unparalleled. I have to see this movie again, if just to hear the roar of the Mitsubishi A6M2, Curtis P-40's, Supermarine Spitfires, and the Bf-109's.  Someone did thier homework as far as engine sounds go. It sounded like the Dayton Air Show only louder.  Now, the actual storyline takes the viewer from rural Tennessee, through New York, the skies above the English Channel, and finally to the Pacific. I wouldn't go so far as to call this a real deep, philosophical tale of two men and a woman, but it does fill the time in between the aerial stunt shots. Okay, perhaps I underrate the significance of the plot to this spectacle. Suffice it to say there is a good storyline here and the delivery is flawless. This movie has something for everyone, except maybe the critics who have forgotten the real reason one buys a ticket to a movie of this stature. If you are one of these, go see Blow or maybe that Brigitte Fonda Diary thing. This ain't no drama flick with Russell Crowe. This is a Memorial Day blockbuster made for the reason the holiday was created: to take you back to that era and to understand what it may have been like to be there. It does it's part to remind us of what took place sixty years ago, and in a way closer to art than a documentary. If you want to see an entertaining interpretation (the reason for big-screens and THX) see this movie. If you want the facts, and nothing but the facts, stay home and watch The History Channel.	5.0	Oh, YEAH!!!	2001-05-28	1	0	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AFBUQ9YFYZPEG	Joel Shepherd	Maybe - maybe - something can be said for the special effects in this film. The aerial sequences were exciting. The images of ships rolling over and bombs triggering - while flatly inaccurate - were nice eye candy.But 'Pearl Harbor' as a whole is a disappointment. The plot is both long-winded and thin. It makes a friendly nod towards historical and technical accuracy, yet nonetheless falls short on a number of counts.What's mystifying is that it didn't need to. For instance, the full drama of the Doolittle Raid was *not* presented faithfully by this film. Find any photo of Hornet launching the bombers and note the condition of the seas. The film shows Hornet launching in calm water and bright sunlight: in truth Hornet was ploughing through waves so high they broke over her forecastle, and the bombers' launch was timed so as not to send them straight into the sea. The film could have been more dramatic - and truer to history - by capturing such details ... but its makers choose not to.Instead it focuses on an uninspiring love story and special effects.The truly sad thing about the movie is the opportunities its makers passed up. The first year of the war in the Pacific has no shortage of dramatic and worthwhile stories: Pearl Harbor, the last 30 days of the carrier Yorktown, the Battle of Midway, the pivotal confrontation at Guadalcanal. None of these stories have a modern telling that takes full advantage of film-making technology: all of them deserve it. The film 'Pearl Harbor' falls short of its potential - and one might argue its responsibility - to tell the story of 7 December 1941 for its own sake, on its own terms.Its makers apparently felt the need to pretty up and dilute the story for, one assumes, commercial gain. It's difficult to dispute the film's commercial success, but one wonders if a more truthful film could not have enjoyed similar success ... and contributed much more to its viewers' understanding of history.	2.0	Decent Effects - Wasted Film	2003-04-21	5	4	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2FA0MN68O2JUP	Joe Mellone	"After seeing the trailer of ""Pearl Harbor"", I had very high expectations of the film.  I kept thinking that it would set a new standard for war films, with brilliant special effects and a stunning reanactment of the infamous Japanese ambush.  Unfortunatley, after an opening night screening, I left the theatre very dissapointed.  I had left with nothing I had wanted to see, and plenty of images of stuff that could have been left out to make the movie a lot better (and shorter).Right from the beginning, Michael Bay (the director) gives us over sentimental images that have nothing to do with Pearl Harbor.  The father of Josh Hartnet's character (at the age of 6 or 7) talks about fighting in the trenches in WWI after Ben Affleck's child likeness accuses him of being a ""German"".  ""No one should have to see what I've seen,"" he says.  Probably there to develop the plot, the scene serves no purpose but to introduce the two male stars.Cut to 1941 with the over-used film reel, we find Hartnett and Affleck have become ace fighter pilots who enjoy showing off their skills in front of the younger pilots.  Soon, nurses show up for no apparent reason and prepare the fighter squadron for war.  Affleck falls for Kate Beckinsale in a terribly sappy scene involving too much medicine and a champagne bottle.Anyway, soon Affleck leaves to fly for the British.  Eventually (after more sap than should be morally allowed by any director, a love trianlge between Affleck, Hartnett, and Beckinsale develop (its a bit too difficult to explain without giving away the first hour and a half).But all this supposed character develpment takes a backseat when the pyrotechnics begin.  Throughout the film, we're treated to Japanese viewpoints that are supposed to tell the reason they attacked Pearl Harbor, but in the end, the screenwriters just end up rewriting history completely.Cut to Japanese fighters skimming over the Hawiian landscape, which at first, is very well shot.  Between the camera following the bomb down into the U.S.S. Arizona, and the shot of a women hanging out her clothes to dry who is suddenly buzzed by low flying aircraft, it seems Bay might actually know what he's doing.  But then people start to get shot, and fall into the water without any trace of blood.  Nurses struggle to save the wounded, but some camera filter that blurs the edges of the screen prevent us from seeing anything to gruesome to warrant a PG-13 rating by the MPAA.  This bombing continues for about half an hour, and throughout the whole attack, war heroes are glorified and bloody slaughter of Americans is turned into a music video for Hans Zimmer's emotional score (the high point of the film) without any blood.  Now, I'm not trying to endorse violence on screen, but when one tries to make a historically accurate film, you must wonder why the water is so clear, despite the hundreds of people in it, whom you are shot many a time by the 30mm aircraft guns.  In the age of Saving Private Ryan, you expect more realism in war violence, but you won't find it here.The movie continues on for another hour (too much more to describe fully).  Overall, this is really a terrible film.  Even the incredible special effects can't save this movie from its terrible amount of sap and violence thats been toned down to a point where families can happily see it together.  If this is the future of historical war dramas, you can bet I won't be in line for a ticket."	2.0	A War Film  At Its Historically Inaccurate Worst!	2002-05-03	6	3	3

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AZXUFTJVXJWL0	John Dynan	"This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The trouble is that young people watching it will be swept up by the various romantic angles and not realise that it is so factually inadequate. This is not the way it happened, make no mistake.The historical details may not seem important to the average viewer but to anyone who has read anything on the subject it is verging on offensive to put this rubbish on screen. This is how Hollywood can misinform people and the punters who have not read anything about it should not be sacrificed at the altar of box office success. Just because it is not a documentary does not mean the public should be misled.In terms of screenplay, this movie cannot be taken seriously as it does not seem to be able to decide exactly what its plot is. There are elements borrowed from ""From Here To Eternity"", ""Tora, Tora, Tora"", ""Battle of Britain"" and ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"", none of which it even comes close to emulating.The characterisations are, at best, shallow and, at worst, positively painful and give the cast little in the way of development to work with. Thus their performances cannot be taken as seriously as one would like, especially in the light of some of their individual achievments in past productions. As for direction, there really isn't much.There is much fudging of names; ""Capt. Thurman"" of the ONI, for example, is clearly a figment of the scriptwriter's immagination and a product of a total lack of research which would have turned up one ""Capt. Alvin Kramer"" had anybody bothered to find out. Dates and events are also copiuosly fudged for no real reason. There were no American pilots in the Battle of Britain and NOBODY used the Luftwaffe for target practice. What you end up with is a comic-book script to replace real American history, thus undermining the dignity and achievements of the participants in the real events. That is an unpardonable sin akin to trivialising.The special effects were poor by comparison with other special effects films and I actually found the attack sequences rather boring. Bomb-cam is getting just a bit too predictable. The flight models are ridiculous and make a WWII Zero fly like an F-16. The ""fighter-jock"" mentality got very wearing, too. US pilots did not shoot down Japanese aircraft in droves in the early days; though some met with success. They had to re-write the manual just to survive against the considerably-more-experienced Japanese who had honed their skills after years of fighting in China. It was only after Midway that American pilots started to gain the upper hand.Sending the cast to boot camp and getting the uniforms right cannot make up for the woeful inadequacies of ""Pearl Harbor"". This film really cannot be taken seriously and I think it should be sold with a warning. This system won't let me give it a zero so I have to give it an undeserved 1 star.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3JC8R7SAL27LM	John Engels	You won't be watching this one in Mr. Smith's History class. The only historically accurate part of this movie was that the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. I'm even surprised they got that right in this film. The fact that I'm a huge WWII History buff makes this movie almost completely useless from a history point of view. Hollywood defiantly worked their charm on this one. Anyway, there were some good scenes during the raid if you fast-forward an hour and a half to get to them so you can miss all the chick flick stuff. I did like the tie-in between Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle raid even though they had nothing to do with each other and none of the pilots from Pearl even flew in it. (Another big history issue) Over all though, it had some really nice special effect during the raid. So if you're into good war special effects there are about 45 minutes to an hour of that good stuff.	2.0	Big Historical Issues	2001-12-10	9	7	2

I had to see something and I rarely agree with critics , so I decided to see "" Pearl Harbor"". Big mistake. Do yourself a favor and go to another movie and hope to catch the ""Pearl Harbor"" trailer, those are the only good 5 minutes out of 3 HOURS! I can never get those 3 hours of my life back or the 20 bucks I spent(went with the wife), but save yourself. Wait for it to be on HBO, don't even wait for the DVD. One of the main problems here is that everyone involved in the film (with the exception of ILM) bit of more than they could chew. Not for one second do you believe that you are taken to another time in history. All the clothes were designed to start a fashion trend and all the nurses are waif models ....

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2GOTY2STOMEAU	John G. Gleeson Sr.	A number of friends who saw and didn't rave about this movie wanted more of a documentary; a &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; with modern special effects. I differ: I believe that each movie stands on its own, both technically, and, more importantly, as a story. I liked the earlier film, but its flaw was and is that it is more of a documentary. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; may well be a misnomer for a great story that goes well beyond December 7, 1941, but if you can set all that aside, this is, from almost all perspectives, a really good movie. The characters are believeable people experiencing real world problems, and one cannot help but be drawn into the drama thus created. Both male leads do very well, but I thought that special praise goes to Kate Beckinsale for portraying a young nurse who comes face to face with horrendous loss of life and injuries and, as a result, matures as a character from dilletant to combat nurse.  It's a great job of acting. The story of two young flyers starts in their boyhood and beginning careers as Army flyers (There was no US Air Force then, just the Army Air Corps). One (Ben Affleck) flys in the Battle of Britain and is believed killed; his friend ( Josh Hartnett) and his fiancee (Beckinsale) fall in love, and the dramatic tension occurs when Affleck surfaces alive and well. The special effects are fantastic; I never got the sense of a computer trying to fool me, although military historians will note that some of the ships that blow up could not have been at the real attack because their radar masts didn't exist then. But one can always nit pick at details. The fact is that &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; has suffered somewhat in the press, but don't let that cause you to turn away from it. You are in for a stunning visual experience with this one. And visually and sonically it is all that we have come to expect of the DVD medium.	5.0	Why Does This Excellent Film Get Bad Reviews?	2002-08-29	12	7	5

Though I was born four years after the Day of Infamy, the battle scenes in the movie seem realistic to me, perhaps even more so than the usual B&W; combat footage of the attack  that we see on the History Channel.This movie makes an historical event come to life because we get to know the characters well enough to become attached to them as the plot unfolds.The director, Michael Bey, did his job well; so did the special effects people.The movie grabbed me and held me for over three hours."	2.0	masterpiece of mayhem	2005-08-12	6	0	6
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3TB0QY2HNH0V7	John H. Weber	As a history and WWII movie buff, I was so completely dissappointed in this pathetic attempt to tell the Pearl Harbor story. The only people that will truly enjoy this movie are those that think special effects are what make a movie good. There were excellant visuals in the bombing scenes but that was only part of what this movie was supposed to be about.The character development was terrible. Cuba Gooding had no actual role in this film and it does a great injustice to the man that actually lived that role. It almost seemed an afterthought to have his character in the movie at all. Secondly, the whole love story really took away from what the movie was intended to be about, namely a tribute to the men and women that died at Pearl Harbor. There are very few facts in this story, with the important history lessons glazed over very rapidly.The director of this movie relies solely on visual effects to carry it, and then adds this horrible, and completely unbelievable love story, to bring it an audience that would normally not be interested in a typical war flick. Imagine if Charlie Sheen had fallen in love in the jungles of Vietnam during Platoon......To make the whole love story worse is that is is so completely cheesy, my wife and I had the plot and ending figured out within 15 minutes of the start of the movie. This movie was a complete sell out for money and he did a disservice to the men and women that paid a price defending this country.	1.0	Huge Dissappointment	2002-01-09	7	6	1

There were too many untruths in the movie which I won't go into.  There was very little involvement of the strategies of what both sides were thinking and planning.  And the Doolittle raid was anticlimatic, probably with someone thinking ""how can we end this movie and resolve the love triangle problem?""

Palchak	I expected a lot out of this movie; between the hype from the previews and the high standard set by &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, I thought great things were in store.  I really was disappointed.  I came expecting a war movie.  I found a movie that wasn't really sure if it was a love story or a war movie...a sort of love story with torpedoes.  The love story was hackneyed, lifted from every two-bit war romance from &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; to &quot;Top Gun&quot;.  The air combat scenes seemed like they'd been done before...  In &quot;Star Wars&quot;, actually.  When one of the aircraft announced its call-sign as being &quot;Red Two&quot; I found myself whispering to my companion, &quot;Luke, we got company!&quot;  The exploitation of FDR's disability for theatrical grandstanding was a bit much.  FYI: FDR was wheeled into Congress only once, and that was after Yalta, in '45.True, the visual effects are very good.  And the scenes of the attack--especially the U.S.S. Arizona blowing up--really sent chills down my spine.  I cannot really recommend watching the entire three-hour movie.  Show up one and a half hours late, and you'll be just in time.	2.0	Better to have one good movie than two great ones	2001-06-14	3	3	0

It seems he isn't dead at all but alive and a love triangle starts for now the Japanese have a plan to attack on Sunday December 7th 1941.Co-starring Jon Voight as President Rooservelt, Alec Baldwin as Captain Doolittle, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Doris ""Dorie"" Miller, Mko as Admiral Yamamato, William Lee Scott as Billy and Dan Ackroyd as Captain Thurman this is an outstanding and underrated WWII action-drama from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Braveheart writer Randall Wallace and director Michael Bay. It's been criticized as a cliche mushy love story disguised as a war movie but it's not true, i believe it has the right ingredients of a successful blockbuster from all three filmmakers and really depicts WWII in a glorious fictional kind of manner. Who cares about accuracy and all that? i think he does a small bit of historical accuracy even on some casting like Cuba Gooding Jr. who made a damn good role of playing the first black American soldier to get the cross-medal and i love Hans Zimmer's brilliant score. The action sequences are well executed by one of the biggest hollywood action maestros Bay and it's a very well made movie that is a must see for everyone as i loved it since i saw it in theaters before my graduation for it's a sad, sometimes uplifting and dark War drama that even has a bit of humor.This 4-Disc DVD set contains the Extended R-rated Director's Cut as intended by Bay but had to tone down some language and graphically gory violent scenes to get a PG-13 rating for everyone to see.

I love war movies and usually enjoy them all.  This movie was an exception.  I was reluctant to go see pearl harbor at first, mostly because Josh Hartnett was in it.  I'm not a big fan of his movies.  However, I went because it was a war movie.......my mistake.  It turned out to be a long, drawn-out, sappy romance much akin to titanic(which says more than enough).  I slept through much of the movie and am quite glad I did.  The only part of the movie that merits any praise is the actual bombing of Pearl Harbor.  This scene was impressive, and yes, I was awake.  One other part that I liked was the scene where the crew of a U.S. vessel is trapped underwater after the raid, some good drama.  However,these scenes were sandwiched by the horrible love story.  Maybe rent it just for the bombing/dog-fight scenes, but for the love of God don't buy it.  You'll never forgive yourself.	2.0	GOOD FIGHTING SCENES, BUT THAT'S ABOUT ALL	2002-08-28	3	1	2

I had heard of all the actors and directors in this movie. I thought it was written very well, by Randall Wallace. And I loved Braveheart, so I thought this would be pretty good also. Now here is my review of the movie, 1.I thought it was a little too long.My rear felt like I had been sitting there from '41-'45. 2.The SFX were great and the acting was good but it could have been alot better. There was just so much too tell it was hard to get it in just one movie.If they had just cut it into two movies and shown them as part 1 in the spring, and part 2 in the fall, it would have been better and you could have put more of the war in, personally my favorite would have been to include the most uplifting part of the war into the movie which was the flag-raising on IWO-JIMA.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A23VGBG17K5NJ3	John Nolley II	Watching this film in theaters was like an excruciating visit to the dentist's office for a couple of fillings, an extraction, and a root canal.My problems with the movie are threefold:1) The film sets up a love triangle with an obvious resolution.  There's no reason to watch the rest of the movie when you know how the triangle will be resolved, yet over 2/3 of the movie is devoted to developing said triangle.  Watching over two hours of material that predictable is incredibly tedious to the point of painfulness.  Plus, the viewer has no reason to side with any party of the triangle, giving him or her no reason to care how it's resolved anyway.2) Said love triangle aside, the film should have ended shortly after the climatic attack and battle of Pearl Harbor.  Everyone from the screenwriter to director to production staff apparently has no grasp of how story structures work, and placing such a powerful sequence only 2/3 of the way through the movie leaves the audience exhausted and apathetic through the remaining hour or so of the film.  There's just no way a true climax/resolution sequence can work with such a powerful sequence preceding it.3) Historical facts were twisted in places, and extraneous side stories (such as Cuba Gooding Jr.'s factually-based role) simply take away from the rest of the film's action.  This movie could have been easily an hour shorter and much more powerful without all the irrelevant side stories that contributed nothing to the movie's plot.  Interesting subplots relevant to the film such as the possibility that the British had intelligence of the attack beforehand yet delayed handing it to Washington (or that FDR possibly intentionally ignored it) to draw the US into the war were left out entirely.  Again, the creators of the film thoroughly demonstrated their lack of plotting skills.Those complaints aside, the DVD version allows the viewer to experience the powerful scenes (such as the Pearl Harbor attack and it's horrific aftermath) while winnowing out the fluff.  The viewer is free to skip past whatever portions of the film he or she wishes, plus experience all the special features included with the disc--so the DVD itself gets three stars from me rather than the one or two the movie itself deserves.	3.0	The only way to watch this flick ... on DVD!	2003-03-03	2	1	1

You have to wait 90 minutes before the attack comes. I know that they tried to make some story and they had to do something, but they should of thought of something else. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is only in the movie 15 minutes, if that, and I really liked his part in the movie. They really could have cut an hour of the movie and it would have been a lot better. Too bad that this really happened, because a lot of innocent lives where lost. I really felt bad for all the soldiers on the Arizona and all the others. I wish in the beginning they had explained better why we cut Japan off from oil? That came up in the movie for two minutes and that was it. You see, after the attack, how the Americans throw a little surprise attack on Tokyo. I never knew about that. I would recommend you see this movie in a good surround sound theatre.

The dialog is more wooden than the acting, the characters are stereotyped, the history is questionable, the emtional situations are contrived. Tora! Tora! Tora! is a far better telling of the history, and From Here to Eternity is a much better love story.

There is one exchange between Affleck's character and his British commander that really sticks out. He says that ""Alot of people frown on the yanks for not joining this war but if there are more like you back at home, then God help anyone who goes to war with America."" That gave me a sense of American pride like never before. It's odd how we can now relate to this movie because like what happened on Dec 7 1941 that sent the US into war.

This movie has gotten alot of flack from the day it was released and still does. The movie itself is very well done. It truly captures the mood of that fatefull day and the chaos that ensued during the battle at Pearl. The romance did not detract from the spirit of the movie and instead added to the drama and truly made you connect to the characters. The acting was superb in this. Ben Afleck gave a spectacular performance one of his best in my opinion. As did Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckensale. John Voight did an excellent job as FDR and Alec Baldwin was the perfect choice for Doolittle, and Cuba Gooding did a great job. The music and effects are stellar and add alot to the movie. The theatrical version of this movie was dumbed down abit in the gore department which didn't bother me much. However now that I have finally seen this Directors Cut it makes this great movie even better. The war scenes are gritter which adds to the realisim and several scenes are extended and one scene is swaped for a different version which changes the whole mood of the last 1/4 of the movie. This is as I stated is more bloody and far more realistic (think Saving Private Ryan)so not for the faint at heart but it is indeed the better of the two versions. Both are great but when compared you won't want to see the other version again.	5.0	A Movie That Will Live In Infamy	2007-11-02	4	2	2

After to see the film, I have to recognize that the reviews I read had a wrong focus. I think that it's a good and welldone movie. All right, in most aspects, is a little bit patriotic but it just fine for me. This movie explain the story of two childhood friends that they enjoy to fly. The years passed and these two kids are grown up (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and they listed to the army. In there, they are in love with to same girl, a nurse played by Kate Beckinsale. But the attack to Pearl Harbor will change it all. This blockbuster film is full of great special effects that make the accions scenes much more realistic. There are a lot of good actors in supporting roles like: Alec Baldwin, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Jon Voight as Roosvelt president of U.S.A. in that period of time, Dan Aykroyd as a member of a Naval Intelligence, among others. It seems  that have to be too long because of 182 minutes but for me it seems short. The main characters are well focused into the movie. The producers had spent around 135 milion dollars that it worths to wait to see the film. The producer Jerry Bruckheimer after to produce blockbusters like but &quot;BAD BOYS&quot; (the first movie directed by Michael Bay), &quot;CON AIR&quot;, &quot;THE ROCK&quot;, &quot;ARMAGEDDON&quot; and in 2000 &quot;GONE IN 60 SECONDS&quot; and &quot;COYOTE UGLY&quot; (one of my favourites), produces in 2001 &quot;PEARL HARBOR&quot; which is directed by Michael Bay, like a partner for Jerry since &quot;BAD BOYS&quot;. Well, finally I got to tell you that I can't finish the review without to mention to the big soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer (The Lion King), and the song that you listen or you'll listen (if you go to see the movie) at the end credits is performed by Faith Hill. I bought the soundtrack 'cause of that song and the great score. After to read my review I hope you'll close the computer first, before to run to the theater near you and buy ticket for this blockbuster &quot;PEARL HARBOR&quot;.	5.0	a Pearl of movie	2001-07-10	2	0	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1AIM4160AX9PY	Joseph B. Rocklin	"Going into this movie I was thinking about what several others have said: it's a knock off of Titanic, and not worth the time.  But, there were some people who told me that it was a great movie, and well worth the expense.  So, I rented it on DVD, and spent an evening watching it.  It was a very good movie.  Like Saving Private Ryan, it is a tribute to a generation who is being forgotten in this day of modern technology.The Department of Defense allowed the movie to be filmed on location in Pearl Harbor, and filming was done on an active aircraft as well.  Most of the extras in the film were military personnel too.  Having the government so helpful in the production of a movie is rare.  The DVD has a good ""Making the Film"" section that talks a great deal about the efforts put into the film to make it realistic, and accurate.When you watch this movie (again, or for the first time), put yourself in the place of someone in the military during the early 1940's.  Spend a little money, and a little time to honor a generation that made extreme sacrifices for this country."	4.0	Poignant, entertaining, and accurate	2002-02-10	1	1	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2DSXA1E02C86D	Joseph Haschka	"First of all, let me make one thing perfectly clear. PEARL HARBOR is a screen novel based on, but not limited to, the actual facts of the occurrence. It's the story of three fictional characters, two Army pilots and the woman they both love, who get caught up in the devastation rained down upon PEARL HARBOR on December 7, 1941. As a novel, historical accuracy and perspective will suffer at the hands of Hollywood screenwriters. So, if you want a true rendering of the incidents of that infamous day, and an understanding of how the U.S. and Japan came to collide there, then read one of the many books on the subject. Or, if you want to stay in the visual mode, see 1970's TORA! TORA! TORA! The film PEARL HARBOR is a piece of Tinseltown entertainment fluff. One should not see it expecting anything more.For the past several months, the trailers for PEARL HARBOR have been one of the best parts of my movie-going experiences. On a purely cinematic level, every scene of the preview was astoundingly good, with visual images - many that are computer generated - that are positively exquisite in their execution. The whole movie does not disappoint on that level, and I'm awarding 4 (and a half) stars for that achievement alone. I cannot remember such an overindulgence in eye candy since that other amour and disaster epic, TITANIC, with which PH will be compared by myself and others.Why not 5 stars? The acting my the main characters is adequate, but not memorable. Ben Affleck, as Rafe, and Josh Hartnett, as Danny, are the two best friends who grow up together sharing a love of flying. By 1941, they've become Army pilots who share a love for Kate Beckinsale, a Navy nurse. There will be the inevitable comparison with the DiCaprio-Winslet romance in TITANIC. For my money, either one of the Rafe or Danny characters is more appealing as a Man's Man than Leonardo's Jack. And Beckinsale's Evelyn is much more an intelligent and substantive character than Winslet's spoiled-little-rich-girl Rose. (Indeed, some of the best scenes are with Evelyn as she struggles to cope with the chaos that descends on the naval base's hospital during and after the Japanese assault.) However, in TITANIC's defense, its love affair was better done, and with more ""chemistry"". Certainly, some editing of the PH love triangle would have vastly improved the finished reels. (Some may argue that PH would've been a better war film with no love interest at all, like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or DAS BOOT, but that would be expecting too much. An action film with only blow-'em-up Guy Stuff wouldn't necessarily appeal to the female audience.) Lastly, in the category of less-than-sparkling role playing, Alec Baldwin was positively wooden. I wouldn't have followed his Jimmy Doolittle persona across the road, much less on a suicide bombing raid of Tokyo.The best performance by an actor was John Voight's FDR, albeit too brief. His portrayal of the President during his post-attack meeting with his war chiefs was one of the best dramatic moments of the film.Finally, there's that element of PEARL HARBOR that's almost intangible to describe, but present nevertheless, though foreign audiences may likely not feel it. Admittedly, the primary goal of the film's producers was to make money. However, as release was scheduled for America's Memorial Day, there must have been the intent to honor that generation of Americans that experienced first hand the horrors of PEARL HARBOR in particular, and the Pacific war against Japan in general, yet fought on to prevail in the end. I came out of the theater immensely proud of those men and women. A true Memorial Day salute."	4.0	A stunning achievement in cinematography and FX	2001-05-27	1	1	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AR2DE47VCY1C8	"Joseph H Pierre ""Joe Pierre"""	It was an entertaining movie.  The actors are probably better known to the current generation than to those of us in our eighth decade.  Like many movies today, the producers seem to be trying hard to be &quot;realistic.&quot;  The love story is complicated by the erroneous report of one of the hero's death, and so his girl falls for someone else and, naturally, gets impregnated at the first opportunity.  The actual attack on Oahu is depicted as a frenetic two hours in which the Japanese were virtually unchallenged, and their bombs wreaked devastation unparalled in the annals of warfare.  A single bomb often destroyed a hangar or battleship.Roosevelt is played by an actor with bug-eyes who didn't quite carry it off, and who referred to over 3,000 victims lost, when actually the count was nearer 2,000.Actually, the Japanese lost nearly ten percent of their aircraft, either shot down by our planes or with anti-aircraft fire.  It wasn't a walk in the park for them.Pearl Harbor devastated the United States Pacific fleet.  Twenty-one of our ships were sunk or disabled.  However, all but three of them were repaired and recommissioned before the war ended.The actors who are youthful enough to play the parts required in such a movie, based on events that happened sixty years ago, are not qualified by life experience to depict people of that generation realistically.  They don't speak the same language, and they are far too urbane.If war movies are your cup of tea, this was a good one.  The visual effects were startling.  It was generally over-acted, but one expects that.Perhaps it's time to put that war behind us.  It cannot truly be recaptured, except using films made at the time from gun cameras and through the lenses of combat photographers who were there.At least, in this one, they didn't use the standard footage of a flight our good old SBD Douglas &quot;Dauntless&quot; dive bombers, pretending they were Japanese dive bombers as most Pearl Harbor movies do.  Every time I see that, I see red.All in all, it was an impressive dramatic movie.Joseph H. Pierre, USN (Ret.)	4.0	A little frantic, but not bad!	2002-01-02	1	0	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1TKM36EYEQNSM	Joseph J. Slevin	This DVD is excellent.  Even the scenes as you wait between movie or other features is enjoyable.Affleck and Harnett have a great relationship in the movie and there are some interesting twists in the film.  I think the hallmarks of the film were the obvious attack on Pearl itself which will actually rock you.  Even the DVD was powerful in that respect.  I do not have a wide screen, yet the DVD did not take away from the impact of the attack scene.  Alec Baldwin as Doolittle also plays an interesting part in the film.The addition of the Doolittle raid gives the film a sense of completion.  Most Pearl Harbor type movies end with proclamations, but this ends with the response to Tokyo.  That actually added to the flick.  There was a war after this attack on America who was really sleeping.Even the length was interesting.  It actually added to the movie.  I think it would have been a rather barren movie if it was shorter.  The relationships in the movie were touching and sensible.  Cuba Gooding as our cook turned hero 'Dorie Miller' does a credible job of blending into the movie just as Dorie Miller blends perfectly into the history of the attack.This DVD is very interesting with the additional features especially touching is the unsung heroes of Pearl.This movie is a testimony to the sense of Pearl Harbor history, there are some areas where, though not perfect have a tendency toward reality.  Even John Voight as Roosevelt starts out a little edgy, yet develops into character.I liked Pearl Harbor and will enjoy this movie from time to time thinking deeply about the impact that the loss of lives had on our nation.	5.0	A Definate Recommend - Well Done Movie	2004-03-16	8	1	7

To my wife and I we loved this movie, so much so we're proud to say we saw it in the theaters about a dozen times. It was by far the best alternative to the junk Hollywood turns out today.  It had everything, a love story, frindship, action, and so many stirring moments that were great, AND, I must say in all truthfulness that in all the times we saw the movie the audience would give it a respectful hand that showed they enjoyed it. Not only that the shows were always packed so word of mouth must have praised the movie. I don't understand where some people got upset with the love story.  Why not?  I seem to remember another great movie ""Gone with the Wind"" having a love story too, with other twists and turns.  The musical score was outstanding by Hans Zimmer. Maybe this movie will not be considered for any oscars but it was entertaining without being gross.  Facts?  Sure, maybe some facts got twisted some but the basic fact about what happen that day educated many people that never knew what took place that day.  I purchased the DVD and it is just as great to see as it was before.  To me the 3 hours went by pretty fast.  I recommend this movie as one of the best 10 movies ever."	5.0	THE BEST MOVIE IN MANY YEARS	2001-12-13	5	1	4
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A27UWBI2R985CM	Joseph M. Perorazio	"By adding a lot more gore, including severed heads, limbs, and oozing innards, Michael Bay manages, with his 'Director's Cut', to turn his schmaltzy epic into a more credible war film, although the atrocious acting and sappy screenplay still hold the entire piece down. Racial slurs are far more prevalent, with extensive use of the ""J"" word, along with some non-repeatable epithets. All of which would be fine, if the film were even remotely credible as an authentic WWII period piece. Alas, by inserting very 21st-century dialogue and a complete lack of historical perspective, 'Pearl Harbor' the director's cut comes over as a poor man's Titanic, aiming for a teen audience while bilking the Greatest Generation out of its deserved tribute. The film is gorgeous, saturated in vivid color and photographed to present the lead actors in full Hollywood glamour, yet the entire effort seems remote and calculated for maximum box office and minimal emotional resonance. The DVD packaging, although quite elaborate, is cumbersome and awkward, including 4 sleeves guaranteed to scratch the DVDs after just a few uses."	3.0	More gore, but still a bore.	2009-11-10	2	1	1

But if they were going to make a film about those events, make it real, lively, &amp; to stick to the plot. This films sticks to a plot about a love story in a event that changed many lives in the world. The sub-plot about what happend at Pearl harbor loses it's place in the film as the love plot grows. This film shoudln't be called pearl harbor. Becuase only 30 minutes of a 180 minutes is about Pearl Harbor. This isnt a historical event film. It's a chick flick. Love story. Not a war movie. I only recommend this film to teens who love teen idols that star in huge movies that are terrible. Like Armageedon. Which i've only seen once &amp; never wanna see again. Same for this. i'd give only 1 1/2 stars only cause of the big explosions &amp; the fight sequence. Some of these actors have better movies than this. Like Ben Afflek in Chasing Amy. Or Cuba Gooding in Boyz in the Hood. Those movies stick with the plot &amp; have a meaning that doesn't lose its touch or meaning.	2.0	Hey i was more into dude, where's my car more than this!	2001-06-30	2	1	1

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1H9GR5198G4DJ	JT	To everyone who &quot;walked out&quot; after realizing this was &quot;a love story&quot; as well as a war movie: you judged it too harshly, too quickly. To Hollywood, which presently is endeavoring to change our society---and not for the better: This exquisite rendering of three lives tragically shattered by WWII, is of such depth and beauty that I am not surprised you didn't appreciate it. The moral overtones must have gagged you. The first time I saw Pearl Harbor w/ a group of neighbors, we lost all track of time. Three hours? To a one, we didn't even notice; it was so absorbing. Everyone cried, we cheered, we passed the Kleenex box from row to row... We felt proud to be Americans. It was a noble, heartrending film. We walked out shaking our heads at the poor reviews, eventually coming to the conclusion that we simply aren't Hollywood; we're just rural America, and we differ greatly from Southern California on any number of issues. I visited my 50-something sister in the DC Beltway area and took her to see it---against her will. She didn't want to go after such poor reviews. She, too, left in tears, barely able to mouthe the words, &quot;Why did this get such bad reviews? It was the best movie I've ever seen!&quot; The third time the story was the same: People all around us were amazed how much they loved Pearl Harbor. It wasn't uncommon to overhear people make snide remarks about Hollywood &quot;killing it&quot; for one reason or another... My dad was at Pearl Harbor. He lost good friends in this war. Dad's a smart man, a retired scientist. If anyone would be critical of a WWII flick, it would probably be him. He usually gets terribly bored at movies and goes along only to keep peace in the family. Not this time... He was completely caught up. During the battle scenes, he was so &quot;in the moment&quot; again, that he actually leaned over the seat in front of him, hung his head, and wept. Afterwards, he sat a long time in the theatre, very quiet...remembering. When he finally did open up, he said, &quot;It wasn't exactly like it was then, but it was pretty close. Pretty close. I guess Hollywood had to put in a little here and there, but they did a good job with this one.&quot; He didn't mind at all that a love triangle was woven into the story. &quot;It wasn't a documentary for crying out loud,&quot; he said. &quot;That personalized it, helped you feel what we felt: the tension, the waiting, the loss, having to deal with your world turned upside down by something more awful than you knew existed before...&quot; He saw Saving Private Ryan and all the others. His conclusion? They were gratuitous, the cursing, the indiscriminate killings, the senselessness of it all. They were far more typical of the Vietnam era than WWII. &quot;No,&quot; he told us, &quot;This one was really more accurate. Very painful to relive, but very true in spirit. Kids need to see this.&quot; It was this way everytime we saw this film. In New England. In the mid-Atlantic. In DC. Five times I saw it, and five times I sat mesmerized. It was so hauntingly beautiful, incredibly sad, yet still redeeming, too. All around me people cried and related to the characters on the screen. Inevitably, someone, sometimes many people, stayed after to comment on how moved they were by this sure-to-be epic. If you didn't see it based on the poor reviews out of Hollywood, go anyway. Don't let them dictate what makes a good movie for you. They're dead wrong on this one. Time will prove it. This movie was about the character, bravery, selfless sacrifice, and delayed gratification that made us a great nation. It's what we're missing in our society today. That the Hollywood generation can't relate to this film isn't surprising. It's a sad reflection on their collective loss of consciousness...	5.0	Don't listen to Hollywood; this movie is epic...	2001-08-27	9	4	5
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2EMP366TTS6E1	Judith Miller	I recently watched this film and it was a timely experience for me. We had just had the anniversary (1945 to 2005) of the end of World War II and I had visited several sites that had displays and memorabilia from that time period.Pearl Harbor is a film worth seeing. I'm not a big fan of Ben Affleck's, but I think this is his best role.  He's probably just being himself, which works in this film, where he plays a young and enthusiastic pilot.  The secondary lead is Josh Hartnett and he delivers an excellent performance as Affleck's best friend.  Kate Becksinsale is the girl that they both love and she is believable as a confident beauty and capable nurse.The film shows the build up and the attack on Pearl Harbor and is presented in a clear and concise fashion.  The horror of the attack is very realistic and I found it frightening to even experience it in a movie.Reading some of the other reviews, I was surprised at how many people disliked this movie. Watching a Hollywood made film and reading a history book are two entirely different things. Films are generally made to entertain and the historic details are often short changed in the endeavor to keep the attention of the audience. How many people actually pay $12 to go to the movie theater to see a documentary?	4.0	-----Compelling-----	2006-07-04	7	2	5

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	ALDIG0716N7HG	Julian Boyce	I was ready to pan this film with one star and much of the same as that seen in earier reviews.  Then I thought, what the h...this is 3 hours of 150 million bucks-worth emotional rollar-coaster ride for only nine dollars.  Can't be that bad then, can it? Actually, I really really enjoyed the film.  My father was a Battle of Britain bomber pilot and met my mother in hospital (a  teenage Wren nurse), after crashing his burning plane on his home runway.  So I think the romantic story in PH is entirely justified - and actually real enough to be true.  Unfortunately it just gets little cliched and repetitive after the first hour -maybe that's because we are looking forward to what's coming next! But this drawn-out romantic prelude is needed to place the following human tragedy, death and carnage of Pearl Harbour into its true perspective.  Because, as we view the explosions, we keep remembering that people live for love, and love always endures beyond death. And so, in my mind, Pearl Harbour is not meant to be a war story but a love story set at an extraordinary time, and it works all the better for that.  And to all those who say it is a war story spoiled by romance, may a suggest you return to your DVD of Saving Private Ryan. I loved this film because it gave me the goosebumps.  I have no idea if the effects looked or felt real because, thankfully, I have never been in a war - but the spectacle was both tremendous and horrendous.  And I suppose it had to be!  War is a terrible tragedy.  But love, always love, conquers all and lets us get on to live and hope and dream for a brighter future. We need more films like this - to bring the real adventure of romance back into the cinema.  All I can say is, well done Michael Bay and all of your talented team. WE NEED MORE FILMS OF THIS QUALITY AND SCOPE.	5.0	a rollar coaster of love and death...	2001-06-25	2	0	2

The back story seems a bit boring and contrived though.Gruesome yes, but far less so than the real battle must have been. Not hard to see how after the bombing of Pearl, the mood in America was one of wanting revenge.	3.0	A Love Story?	2014-05-27	0	0	0

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3MAYDDC5BBFPS	"Just ME ""Mixed Girl"""	Let me go ahead and just say that Titanic is my most favorite movie and that I also like The Notebook. I like period romantic films especially set around tragic events.With that said, I like Pearl Harbor. The first time I saw it, I hated it. Saw it on tv a few months back and hated it. Finally decided to rent it and I guess 3rd time is the charm because then I realized it was a good movie.This movie is most definitely not for everyone. It is true, this movie has the romance and tragedy of Titanic, the gore and war of Saving Private Ryan, and the buddy relationship and flying of Top Gun. This movie is not for serious war buffs. It is first and foremost like Titanic and The Notebook, a love story.It is kind of like a war movie lite. Someone like me could not sit through war movies like Saving Private Ryan or miniseries such as Band of Brothers because of their grittiness.I think Pearl Harbor's biggest flaws happen to be that they tried to pass it off as an action flick rather than emphasize what it truly is-a romance film.I do think the movie lacks in some areas which still get irritating. I hate the intercuts between the love story and the Japanese plotting against Pearl Harbor. I feel it would have been better had they just focused in one specific storyline and just went with that instead.Also the lines are pretty cheesy and corny at times.But its definitely a movie for any girl that likes romance stories or maybe even finds Ben Affleck or Josh Hartnett to be yummy to look at it. It is not a movie for people who take this subject matter serious. From what I heard there are better versions out there on the events of Pearl Harbor such as Tora Tora Tora.But nonetheless I will give it 4 out of 5 stars. It will never be Titanic but it is a good movie to watch and the sets are so beautiful that one could watch the movie just for that alone.Whether you like the movie or not will strongly depend on what you want from movies.	4.0	Not Titanic or The Notebook but good enough	2011-02-05	1	0	1

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AU6YUO58UAIOP	J. Winter	Okay... do you like disaster flicks? If you do, you'll like this movie.Personally, I've come to despise the all too predictable over-used formula which Pearl Harbor has epitomized so well. Let's start out with the love story, cheesy as it is. Oh no! We have to squeeze this love story into an hour or less! Whatever shall we do! Let's just rush the love story and turn it into an intense, yet fake teenage style romance which leaves the audience feeling totally numb. This comment about the audience feeling totally numb does, of course, have a few exceptions among those teeny-boppers who think this is real love (psst, a little secret: it's not real love).Now that we've gone through this love story bit, let's have the main character die somewhere overseas and come back to life only to find out, predictably, that his best friend has now stolen the girlfriend. Okay... since they're male they now have to fight over the whole thing, leaving this little element of jealousy get in the way of their friendship and their love for the girlfriend (remember the girlfriend? this story includes a girlfriend somewhere).Through this whole love and jealousy episode, the dialogue starts out painful, then becomes remarkably torturous. By now, it becomes a relief to see things blow up. Lo and behold! The Japanese fighter pilots come to save the movie and blow things up. What a relief. Of course, now, unfortunately, it's Pearl Harbor that gets blown up, killing many soldiers, medical personnel, and even civilians. It wouldn't be a disaster flick if we didn't see more people die than what the human imagination could truly fathom. Indeed, those of you with a disaster flick fetish can get your kicks in watching thousands of soldiers blow up or drown in a massive bombing raid.So not only does the movie start out with an all too predictable love and jealousy story, but we now get to watch as certain Hollywood producers decide to dishonor the memories of those who perished in this tragic raid. Yes, tragedy turns into marketing for a poorly conceived and poorly written disaster flick. As it turns out, this disaster flick is truly itself a bomb.The remainder of the movie does not even try to be historically accurate. Not even close. If you're in the theater by the time you see FDR stand up, that's your que to stand up and leave the theater.There is one good part in it, however. I'll go ahead and reveal it so you don't have to waste your money. In one scene, the Japanese admiral who masterminds the whole attack on Pearl Harbor is told that he is a genius. The admiral claims that he is not a genius. Instead, genius comes in being able to prevent the war from happening in the first place. That's it. That's the good part. The rest is junk.	1.0	Terrible in every respect	2001-05-31	7	6	1

The emotions ran so deep in the film through every aspect.  You realize how horrible this attack really was and you come to understand the hostilities that came to be toward Japenese Americans after the attack.  Personally, I love the love story.  Although I can understand how some wouldn't, I thought it brought you back to the age of innocence that was the forties. It brought you into a childhood friendship (Ben Affleck &amp; Josh Hartnett) and a budding love (Kate Beckensale) and shows the challenges they faced during early years of WWII.  I love the film and plan to see it again.  I highly recommend it.	5.0	40's genre back again and better than ever	2001-05-29	3	2	1

But the love story is where the real story is:The love story is poorley done and wasn't too gripping. You can't see the &quot;love&quot; between any of the charactors develop, Raffer (Ben Affleck) apparently fell in love with Kate Beckinsdales charactor(i forget the name) in just a few nights and after Raffers death she falls in love with Danny (Josh Hartnett), again you really don't feel their &quot;love&quot; for eachother and it really makes Kate Beckinsdale look like a &quot;two-timer&quot; only because you still know that Raffer is alive.The ending ( i won't ruin it) was predictable, I called it even before the movie started.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1IOJE0W1NXOSE	Karen Potts	I have read some of the negative reviews and choose to respectfully disagree with them.  I do not know how historically accurate some of the scenes are, but I did like the idea of making this an intensely personal crisis by zeroing in on characters who were in Hawaii at the time of the attacks.  There is a love story (or more accurately a triangle) and the viewer is introduced to young people whose idealism is only exceeded by their naivete.  Theirs is a world of flirting, young love, dancing, and parties.  Harsh reality soon sets in when the character played by Ben Affleck volunteers for duty with British fighter pilots who are already embroiled in war.  The other characters enjoy the good life in Hawaii until the attack brings them, too, into the terrible reality of war.  My advice would be to forget the pre-conceived notions of what you think this movie ought to be and enjoy the photography, special effects, and interaction of characters which makes this an entertaining movie.	4.0	A Day of Infamy	2001-12-08	3	2	1

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AKB75HRACZIOP	Karl Morkunas	Pearl Harbor contains the perfect ingredients for a classic of epic proportions. Many critics proclaimed that the film focused heavily more on romance which made its beginning tedious, but its very few opionated negatives cannot touch the foundation of this films magnificent values. Some segements may not historically accurate, but no one can ever portray a perfect image, thus Pearl Harbor accomplishes its goal of rendering the horrific event of defeat that took place in Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7th, 1941. The actors pull off excellent performances that compliment the near flawless visual effects. The cast includes: Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett as two young, daring pilots, Kate Hartnett, a commited, beautiful nurse, and Jon Voight, as President Rossevelt. Along with special effects, romance, and suspense, Pearl Harbor has vital morals that fit in perfectly to the plot. Jon Voight delievers a strong, outstanding performance as President Rossevelt. This movie is definetly for you if you enjoy romance, action, drama, and real-life based events. The DVD is top-notch with numerous special features that appeal with much interest.	5.0	Romantic, Thrilling, Dramatic, Action-packed	2002-01-07	6	2	4
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A65Y6QL4GME54	Kassy Cocker	Hi my name is Kassy and i think that Pearl Harbor was an 5 star rating because it had some good action in it and some really good actors in it like Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, Alec Baldwin etc. I think that the producer the writer and the director all did a excellent job in making this movie good and exciting. I think that Danny and Evelin had more chemestry than when it was with Rafe and her. I felt that in this movie  at the end they could have made it so that they (Danny,Rafe,and Evelin) could have all lived happily as friends and that Danny and Evelin should have ended up together for 2 reasons because she was having his baby and i felt that she loved him more, But that is just what i think. Anyway i really injoyed the movie and i think that Josh Hartnett was a great person to get to play that role as Danny, and i think that he will go a far way in his career and to prusue his dreams.This movie was  one of the best movies i have seen in a long time.CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!You did a great job!Kassy!	5.0	Pearl Harbor	2002-01-03	2	0	2

The love story (stories?) did nothing to endear the main characters to you (if you could even believe that such events transpired) and the actual attack on Pearl Harbour was, sadly, only a small slice of the film. The action scenes were well constructed but it wasn't enough to save this movie.Also - I don't really think personal attacks on someone who writes a review is necessary.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A30KN7FC99GQJT	KC	I really love the way the planes flew through the house very naturally.  Even on a Dolby Pro Logic system, it sounded so real.  The transition of the air planes flying from the back to the front was very accurate, real-like, and smooth.  Also, having this in a 2.35:1 original aspect ratio, it gave more breathing room for them planes to fly, unlike some butchered up version you'd get on VHS.  Speaking of which, I saw the first 5 minutes of Pearl Harbor on Pay Per View and it was Pan and Scanned to a 1.85:1 aspect ratio and it was bad.  It looked too tight.  Imagine what having it P&Sed down to 1.33:1 would look like.  If you want to see this movie, don't watch it on PPV, or any of the movie channels, but watch it on DVD.  The special effects and the visuals will blow you away.  My Passive subwoofer was rockin' too.  I was surprized.	5.0	Special Effects ROCKED!!!	2002-06-10	5	1	4
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2L5P60B1U02NX	"K-Dizzle ""Keerut S."""	After watching this movie I thought it was pretty good going on great. Then after reading the bad reviews I think the problem is that some people in historic/war movies look SO far into history and the exact little details that may be a little different in the actual movie.Bottom line is when making a movie you can't show everything totally realistic and perfect. If you do that it will be just another educational documentary about pearl harbor.You have to have main characters and you have to show the story of the horrible attack that was made on pearl harbor at the same time. I think they accomplished that very well. They showed the fiction love story and how the characters were living before the attacks as a lead in. Then Danny dies at the end to show how the attacks must have affected people personally who were involved, or had anyone close to them involved with pearl at all. The huge 40 minute scene of the Attack is in my opinion greatly done and shows the destruction brutally and vividly. Then when they show the first attack back, they were trying to show how America would band together, grow stronger, and eventually win WWII. I also must add all the actors did a very good job in their roles.This movie was shown very well with great acting great special effects with i must add a great tandem being Bruckheimer/Bay. Also, screenwriter Randall Wallace who wrote Braveheart. Some people also have a problem with the love story but I think it goes good with the movie especially more on a personal and touching level after the attacks. And hell if you can deal with the love story in Titanic don't attempt to diss the love story in Pearl Harbor. So people need to stop looking so much into it and watch it for what it is.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AM31WG1P8YX3E	Keith Watt	It's sad, with the amount of money spent and the historical interest in WWII this could have been a really good film.  It just needs a screenplay, a director who can direct, actors who can act, and a plot that's not quite so contrived.  Instead, the filmmakers took the low road of trying to make a buck my integrating (should I say stealing) as many film clich&eacute;'s as possible.  A woman looses the love of her life due to the war, finds her new love, only to have her first lover reappear creating a hopeless love triangle (anyone see Casablanca?).  War as hell is captured on film by showing bombs and bullets killing massive numbers of people (anyone see Saving Private Ryan?).  People struggle and drown as the ship sinks (anyone see Titanic?).  The nurse ventures into the throng of wounded, dead and dying and is overwhelmed with the magnitude of the carnage (anyone see Gone with the Wind?).I could put up with the cinematic clich&eacute;'s if only the acting, screenplay, and direction weren't so lame.  It's obvious the actors are, well, acting.  Little genuine emotion reaches the viewer, and the dialogue is unbelievably contrived.  There is no gratuitous nudity or sex, but in this film their inclusion would have been a welcome diversion.Having said all that, I'll give the film 2 stars, if only for the action, costumes, some pretty good aerial dog fighting footage, and the pure spectacle of it all.	2.0	Did I miss any clich&eacute;&#65533;s?	2002-08-15	0	0	0

In this day and age, just 60 years from the day this movie took place.  Very different from the way we are today.  This movie is not just about the details behind or how graphic the attack is, it's about a time when not just a few people but a whole country went to war.  How as a nation we all did something to save our way of life.  Not just our arm services, the whole country did something.  Many people lost their lives, a day to remember, Ask yourselves this, what have I done today that was for someone else, not yourselves or your family, but someone else? Anything?

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2TKMQVK96YZ10	"Kelcony ""katk303"""	This might not be the best movie ever made; the action scenes were confused, it was drawn-out, and the storyline certainly had flaws. But this movie was the first take on the event at Pearl Harbor that really hit home. I suddenly understood as I watched the movie that THIS REALLY HAPPENED, these people did die trapped underwater, they did go on this suicide mission, this is how things were. So I forgive Pearl Harbor for its flaws and recommend it. I especially liked how the movie showed the Japanese point of view; too many portrayals of war depict the US as the saintly power and other countries as jealous demons attempting to dethrone us.This is a good movie for a rainy day with a few (at least 3 and a half) empty hours and a box of tissues.	4.0	Pearl Harbor	2004-02-17	5	0	5

They did an amazing time with the special effects! I saw a special about the special effects in the movie the  other day. Did you know that there were only 9 japenesse planes used and all the others were just computer animated?!? The shots of the planes flying inbetween the boats were computer animated, the scene with the planes flying inbetween the 2 buildings, that was completly computer animated, nothing about that shot was real! They put a lot of hard work into that movie. You might say that the  movie had bad dialoge or it had too much love stuff in it,but you have to give them props for those specail affects!

Yes, it was a Hollywood love story also, but it made people start talking about it again, and thats the best way to educate and remember those men and women who lost their lives in that battle.

If you are interested in World War II, pick up anything else (even U-571).I think this movie would have been much better if it were set in a sci fi setting with a space port named Pearl Harbor that is attacked by aliens.  For all pratical purposes, the Japanese in this movie might as well have been aliens.  You don't get any background story to their goals other than they are going to split up the love triangle.  Speaking of which, could we have gotten a more predictable finish to that story?  No.One more note, why did it have to end with the Doolittle Raid?  And for that matter, why did our intrepid heroes have to fly it?  They had a hard enough time training B-25 pilots to do it.

In short, Pearl Harbor is a hell-stew of ear-shattering volume, wooden acting, laughable dialogue, unfunny humor attempts, and bad history.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2POE5N2HCHXNI	Ken Laws	Yet another three-hour-long waste of film from the Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer mill, where the motto is, &quot;Make every shot look like a bad car commercial.&quot;The first *hour* is devoted to Ben Affleck failing to convince us that he's in love with Kate Beckinsale (really, it's Bay's fault.) Then Josh Hartnett falls for Kate after Ben is shot down and presumed dead. Josh knocks up Kate and Ben shows up alive, all just in time for the big attack.Yes, after an hour or so, the Japanese finally show up and start bombing, torpedoing, strafing... lots of explosions. But it's edited so fast that you can't tell what's going on. The one real &quot;money&quot; shot is the Arizona being blown literally out of the water. But that's not worth $9 and three hours of your life.Ben and Josh are the only Americans to get into the air, and they shoot down around 10 battle-hardened Japanese pilots, because, after all, they ARE American farm boys, the world's most deadly weapon.After the attack, the movie goes on for ANOTHER hour or so. I guess Bruckheimer thought ending the movie with America on the ropes wouldn't sell, so we get to see Doolittle's raid on Tokyo, or the Cliff Notes version of it.Then Ben and Josh crash, Josh gets killed, and Ben and Kate raise Josh's son.Ben Affleck is capable of good work, but I guess he needs a good director. Here, he just walks around with his jaw jutting forward.Kate Beckinsale plays the typical Bay/Bruckheimer female, one dimensional, doing nothing but pining for her guy(s).Oh, and in terms of historical accuracy, you're better off renting &quot;Tora Tora Tora.&quot;	1.0	WARNING: Pearl Harbor is playing at a theater near you!	2001-05-28	92	55	37

I found the film to be very entertaining and a sincere effort to honor those who lost their lives that day and to all the veterans of World War II.  As a student of American and military history, I expected and accepted that there would be some historical inaccuaracies.  However, I was surprised and pleased by whatthe film got right[.]...Overall, ""Pearl Harbor"" was a very satisfying movie and I am glad that I have had a change of heart and now own a copy...I applaud the cast and crew for a job well done and thank them for their homage toour veterans.

A war movie that has a sub plot outside of the war itself? And THIS is what the majority of you who do not like the movie are complaining about? Pearl Harbor is a movie that can appeal to a large audience without taking away from history itself, and it has a very good reproduction/reenactment of a major event. What is so God awful about that? New Year's Eve 2001 - 2002 saw my wife and me, and our four children, settling down to watch the DVD of Pearl Harbor for the very first time. We were so engulfed in this movie that we missed the countdown to the new year! Well worth the price of purchase, and one that we will watch on December 7th for years to come!God Bless those men who died in the actual event, as this movie brought home the fact that Pearl Harbor is more than just a date on the calendar, just as 'Saving Private Ryan' did for D-Day. And even though the events happened 60 years ago, the heroic acts  of our men in uniform (and the cowardly act of the Japs way back then) are just as pertinent today (especially after September 11) as ever.	5.0	You People Are Nuts!	2002-01-01	4	1	3

It engaged me completely, and I found the storyline to be completely believable and touching. Yes, it's a plot that has been used many times before, but that doesn't make it less effective.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A37YLC3NWJ33CU	Kevin Appleby	You can forget this one.  I don't think there's been such a huge waste of production money since WATERWORLD and HEAVEN'S GATE.  How anyone could take an event as monumental as Pearl Harbor and turn it into a slow, simpering, dreary soap opera is a mystery to me.  The thing is sanitized and politically correct beyond belief--it's 1941 and nobody smokes!  Cuba Gooding does his by-now-standard walkon as the heroic black guy held down by the white system, the women come across like California career valley girls in 1940s nurses' uniforms, and Josh Harnett does so much sad-eyed puppy dog whining that you're actually relieved when he gets killed off in the end (don't worry--knowing that won't ruin this turkey for you, I promise).  But the biggest irritant is Ben Affleck.  If there's a more annoying, artificial leading man around today, I don't know who it is.  He manages to project a self-absorbed inner weakness and lack of character even as he's jutting his sculptured jaw and doing his John Wayne imitation.  And in this stupid flick, he's HERE, he's THERE, he's EVERYWHERE!  He's a fighter pilot who goes off to join the Eagle Squadron and fly Spitfires in the Battle of Britain.  He gets shot down.  Then he ends up in Pearl Harbor flying P-40s for the Army Air Corps.  Then he mysteriously ends up transferred to B-25 bombers for emergency duty with Jimmy Doolittle for his famous Tokyo raid.  What--there weren't enough qualified bomber pilots already trained to fly this important mission, they had to re-train fighter pilots Affleck and whimper-boy Hartnett to get the job done?  Ridiculous.  Slow, ponderous, boring, poorly written, and burdened with special effects (when something finally, actually does happen) that seem far too sci-fi for a WWII tale, PEARL HARBOR is a complete and utter failure.  You want to see the definitive story of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, rent 1970's TORA TORA TORA.  Now there is a fantastic movie about Pearl Harbor.	1.0	Forget It.	2002-04-26	4	3	1

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AATS9Q7VJ4PFI	Kevin R. Austra	This movie is just plain bad.  So many missed opportunities.  The screenplay is undermined by the all too predictable love triangle story.  Love and war tales only mixed well in 1980s network television mini-series.  PEARL HARBOR is too long and too complicated.  Additionally, and  unlike its predecessor TORA, TORA, TORA, the action scenes of PEARL HARBOR rely too heavily on CGI.  CGI is great in science fiction films, but appears as a phony video game image when representing actual aircraft.To their credit, the producers were able to borrow an aircraft carrier, fly actual and replica zero aircraft, as well as assembled flyable P-40 Warhawks and B-25 Mitchell bombers.  Unfortunately these aircraft scenes were fluffed up with computer generated images that removed all reality from aerial scenes.The ship scenes are credible, particularly the extensive recreation of the USS Oklahoma's capsizing.  If history alone carried the story this movie would have had a chance.  However, in PEARL HARBOR history played second fiddle to the romance.In PEARL HARBOR it is also annoying to find the main characters everywhere.  Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) begin their military service at Mitchell Field, Long Island.  Sorry Michael Bay, Long Island does not have any dry khaki foothills.  Here Rafe conveniently receives orders to join the Eagle Squadron and fight the Luftwaffe.  The RAF's Eagle Squadron was not an organization that was eligible for US Army Air Corps orders.  In order to participate in the Eagle Squadron -- or the Flying Tigers, for that matter -- an officer would have had to resign his commission and left the service.  Of course it was the only way to separate Rafe from his love interest Navy nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale).Rafe is shot down by a Messerschmitt and presumed dead thus freeing Evelyn to fall in love with Rafe's best friend Danny.  Danny's squadron along with Evelyn and her nurse peers find themselves shipped out to Hawaii.  Evelyn no sooner swoons for Danny when Rafe shows up. Not only is Rafe alive and well, he is also an ace.  The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor interrupts the romantic debacle as Rafe and Danny put aside their differences take to the air against the Zeros.  After some fancy CGI flying, both pilots return to donate blood for the wounded and rush off to the anchorage to assist with the rescue effort.Rafe and Danny then volunteer to become bomber pilots and join General Doolittle in his raid on Tokyo.  Danny sacrifices his life to save Rafe and resolving the uneasiness between the two over Evelyn.  Thus Rafe is free to return to a pregnant Evelyn and both remember Danny through his son.War and romance do not mix.  ENEMY AT THE GATES was proof of that.PEARL HARBOR  boasts some great supporting actors with Alec Baldwin as General Doolittle, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Dorie Miller, and Jon Voight doing a great job portraying President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Their roles could have been better had the movie not been crowded with a love story.A lot of work went into this movie.  When I went to see the film I brought a copy of PEARL HARBOR: THE MOVIE AND THE MOMENT to read while waiting for the film to begin.  After leafing through the book I expected much more from the film.  Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett fans will probably enjoy this film, but military history enthusiasts should snub it all together.	1.0	Doesn't Hold a Candle to TORA, TORA, TORA	2008-05-04	5	3	2

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AU00XG6EK3RH2	Kevin W. Howlett	"It's funny--I remember reading an interview with Michael Bay, part of a little press junket for the movie ""Pearl Harbor"", a movie that I had waited eagerly to see since viewing the trailers some months before. In the interview he overtly admitted that James Cameron was one of his biggest influences as a filmmaker. So it is not very surprising to discover that this movie more or less follows the formula presented in the much better ""Titanic"".In the movie, two Army pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) fight for the affections of a nurse (Kate Beckinsale), and to complicate matters, the Japanese attacks Pearl Harbor. Bummer.The movie is filled with flaws:1. The trailers for the movie gave the illusion that the movie would be ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" with better special effects. It was not, and only after watching the movie would one be aware of it. I liked ""Titanic"", but then again, with that movie I KNEW what I was getting into.2. Love triangles are cliche, and a movie like this one could probably get away with it; however the filmmakers chose instead to foolishly make all three corners of the triangle likable. Such a spin should be reserved for a more artsy movie that is trying to make you think.3. The tragedy of the air raid at Pearl Harbor is trivialized by using it as a means to further a love story as opposed to presenting it as the catalyst to America's involvment in WWII. At times this is disappointing, at other times, appalling.I'm trying to ignore historical inaccuracies but I can't help it--hey, I didn't know they had Spruance-class destroyers in 1941! Also, there's no such place as downtown London. I always thought there was a Central London. Shows what I know.4. The movie, which would have ended on a stronger note by concluding with the air raid, drags on into a perfunctory depiction of Col. Doolittle's raid on Tokyo--a scene which did not have the intended impact. It also lacked the visual flourish and detail of the 30+ minute-long air raid sequence.  It is in the movie for no other reason than to knock a corner out of the love traingle.5.  Finally, the gore of the movie is sort of out of place.  Since this was a PG-13 movie that was angled at teenyboppers (and yes, Michael Bay, it would have been nice if I knew that!!), the effects of being shot/blown up are toned down to a 1950's filmmaking sort of level.  We see Japanese planes strafe helpless sailors trying desperately to hold on to their ships and defend themselves, and when they get shot, the bullets don't punch huge holes in them and send blood flying everywhere, but instead leave a clean, fun-looking hole; the sailor clutches shot part of body, screams and falls over.  When someone is too close to an explosion, the body is not torn apart by the concussion but merely lifted into the air and placed elsewhere.  I half-expected some of the sailors to immediately get up after being thrown by an explosion, brush himself off and say to the camera, ""That one was a doozy!"" before rejoining the battle or getting a fun-looking hole punched in him.So if we follow the movie's logic, the hospital scene would be impossible because there was no bloodshed in the battle scene, at least, not the kind that warrants the need to dump spare blood into Coke bottles.Now, the DVD extras on this movie are something of an oddity--they're fantastic.A documentary of the Pearl Harbor raid is included. It's almost like the filmmakers knew the movie lacked a lot of historical context (the motive for attacking Pearl Harbor, we are told in the movie, was something so simple it could be surmised in a single line of dialogue) and threw these in to supplement the lack of historical information in the movie.The ""making of"" featurettes are good, as you would imagine, but the unintentionally reveal a paradoxical fanatacism on the part of the special-effects house to ""get the facts down"" by looking at photographs taken of the raid in progress, which is bizzarre, given the historical gaffes in the movie's script.This movie is a definite ""take it or leave it"". The movie is ostensibly for teenagers; history buffs will no doubt hate it, as will military movie fans (not all of which are history buffs). Those people would benefit more from watching ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" and looking for a Pearl Harbor documentary, sold separately."	2.0	A thouroughly bad movie with great extra features	2003-02-25	1	1	0

Something bizare is the fact that this happened just a few months after the $150 million film pearl harbor. I thought this film was amazing, it was like viewing a piece of art from the 1940s. This was supposed to be thebiggest film of the last 20 years, obviousy it wasn't. This film has many things wrong with it. Anybody whose anybody knows that, but it also had many good p-oints as well. Some things that really got on my nerves are the nurses. This was a disgraceful way to present nurses of the era. They were trampy, annoying dimwitts. All they did was subtract from the film. The script could have been much more involving, yet it wasn't the worst. The musical score by Hanz Zimmer is won of the best I've ever heard. The biggest problem with this film is the romance.i' m not one for romances but I can tell you this one isn't that good. Mainly puppy love with cheesy lines. The acting overall was pretty good though the actors didnt have much to work with. on Voigts performance as Fdr was great, Cuba Gooding Jr. was good. Alec Baldwyn wasnt bad. I dont like Ben Affleck, but he did allright.Josh Hartnett was good too. I wish Kate Beckinsale had more to do as a female lead. All she did really was say hey boys aint I pretty. The historical innacuracy really didntbothe me to much. Braveheart was inaccurate ad it was great! How much you liked this film soley depends onhow high your expectations were. Since the teaser in 2000 I knew i had to see this film. I didnt enjoy seeing the japanese portayed as guys who were innocent and didnt want to go to war. Anyone remember the 7,500 americans who died at the bataan death march?The Bombing itself was soincredible it could makeucrap your -pants! The film dos a great job of showing the faces of the 3,500 americans that lost their lives. What the japs did to Ameica was unforgivable. Pearl Harbor is mjor american history. It is the event that launched usa into world war 2. My heart goes out to the boys who lost their lives that morning. not enoug development on the battleships though. Those Japs should be very greatful that we put them back on their feet when the war was finished. The film didnt show any racism toward the japs, very unrealistic. I wanted t see more of the natives. I would also have liked to see more character development between the male characters. If you havnt bought the p-13 version of the film you should save your money for the 4 disc directors cut. It has 12 hours of supplements. The new directors cut will show an all knew re-edited version of the film with a more realistic blooded up bombing. Itll show sailors being cut in half, decapitated, disembowled etc. Overall Pearl Harbor is a good american movie, check it out!"	5.0	Day of Infamy, movie of a thousand emotions	2002-06-22	1	0	1

The picture quality was dark and grainy on most of the scenes.  The movie was not shot in HD.  This was simply a film to HD conversion.  Most of the older movies did not have HD filming back then.  ""The Cave"" was partially shot in HD to show some of the beauty of the actual cave.  The sound was low during the vocal scenes.  I had to turn the volume down during the fight scenes.  It was shaking the whole house.The movie comes to life in all the fight scenes.  The special effects bombing of Pearl Harbor was absolutely stunning.  The sound and picture quality was absolutely breath-taking.  They really worked on putting the 1080P to the test during these scenes.  This made up for the rest of the dingy quality of the movie.If you watch a lot of HD movies or HD TV shows, you should know what I'm taking about.  If you want to see some really crystal clear HD quality, then you should buy or rent Mission Impossible 3 on Blu-ray.  Every single light in the city sparkles with super clarity.  IMAX films have some impressive quality.  Most of the new releases like ""Click"" are very clear.  Terminator 2 was nice, but they already had a compressed HD version on the T2 Extreme DVD version for the PC.Watch the History Channel extra included on the disc!Note: Quality does not change from Blu-ray, HD-DVD or Terrestrial Stream .TSHD=HD  More space does not = better quality (until they actually start using most of the space for better quality)"	3.0	Blu-ray quality review only	2007-01-08	20	11	9

Secondly, the love story didn't help.It was added just to take up time.And It reminded me of Days of our Lives. It was like a soap opera thrown into a war movie. This movie had the audience so caught up into the love story that in a way it overshadowed what happened to the people at pearl harbor.3. It was a total guy movie. The love story was not appealing to women because the made the woman that was starring in this movie seem shady. It was just shooting and blowing things up. And the two main male characters seemed like they were having a good time doing it.Pearl harbor could of been a lot better. It reminded me of Armaggedon.

I am glad I did.  This was a great movie.  This is truly a movie that men and women will like.  Unlike Titanic, which some claim to be a man and woman's movie (it really isn't, its just a romance movie with special effects) Pearl Harbour really does offer something for both sexes.  The love triangle between the three characters is believable and the attack scenes are spectacular.  The only minor quibbles I have is that some parts are a bit melodramatic and despite great acting Ben Affleck, his southern accent sounds a bit off while his co-star Josh Harnett's seems authentic.  But all in all a great movie and a must have for any serious DVD collection.	5.0	Do not believe the bad hype, this is a great movie	2002-02-16	1	0	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	APFJ5JO12641J	"""kierstin"""	Two and a half hours of my life gone forever.At best Pearl Harbor is a chick-flick!  As it is the only person I know who really loved this movie is a 12 year old girl.  I shouldn't have to say any more than that, but I can't help it.  I feel cheated after paying to rent this movie.  To dedicate 90 minutes of my life to the most contrived love story I've ever endured for what I will have to say is the coolest battle scene I've ever seen, then the trashing of the Doolittle raid.  I'm insulted.  This could have been a great movie.  It could have informed and enlightened this generation.  Instead it's pure (...).  The events leading to Pearl Harbor are all but ignored and love takes center stage and it's nothing new.From writing to her lover from the beach at sunset to having sex with his best friend in a hanger full of parachutes I wretched at every twist and turn in the love story.  I hate that every movie made has to have a love story in it.  Take this subject and add a love story to give some human interest to a war story, but to make it a love story and gee, we're sorry the Japanese ruined your fun.I don't want to give away the ending, but movies like this are what's wrong with this country.  Sending messages to the intended audience (12 year old girls) that it's ok to be in love with one person and have sex with his best friend and when you end up pregnant and the guy that got you that way isn't around any more your boyfriend will take you back and raise the baby.If you know somebody that has this movie I would recommend borrowing it before you waste your money buying it... unless you have a really great home theater set-up, then you can forward the DVD to 1:24:00 and have a great time for 30 minutes.	1.0	Buy Tora Tora Tora and won't waste your time here!	2001-12-17	5	3	2

I am so glad I caught this on cable, rather than spent my good, hard-earned money on this awful film.  While I give credit to Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett & Kate Beckinsale for some decent acting-it's a shame that this story as presented turned out to be more of a soap opera than anything else. Cuba Gooding, Jr. barely had much screen time, but the few scenes he had were outstanding & left me wanting much more. To be fair, the special effects scenes-especially showing the attack on Pearl Harbor, were terrific-it's just that Hollywood took too much poetic license here & made what should have been a terrific film into a terrible one.  The movie, thanks to the soap stuff(Rafe falls for nurse Evelyn, Rafe goes off to fight in Europe, crashes into the sea & is supposedly KIA, then after Evelyn finds consolation in the arms of Rafe's best buddy Danny, of course Rafe suddenly turns up all in one piece at Pearl Harbor, etc.)is about an hour too long.  SAVE YOUR MONEY, FOLKS-Watch it on cable(I've seen it on STARZ! myself)or wait til it eventually turns up on regular network television-edited down for tv, just as they did last year with the much more glorious Saving Private Ryan(they must make room for all those commercials, after all!).

A few months ago when the movie was just starting its publicity, i was writing a report on how the attack on pearl harbor was a conspiracy. people in my class asked me if i would see the movie. i answered maybe. My friend saw it and she dragged me to it because it was the best movie she ever saw. IT WAS BETTER THAN I COULD HAVE IMAGINED. The characters were ones that you couldnt help but love and laugh along with. Also two hot guys as the main characters made it even better. Durring the battle scene it did get to be a bit much but just when you had enough the scene ended. That is probably the only thing that i wasnt completely happy with in this movie. While many people are saying that it seems more present day than the 1940s theyre not lying but i think that it made it alot easier to relate with the movie. Those things are all put to the side when you see some of the amazing shots that they had. The first time i saw it i was amazed because i had never seen anything like when the japanese were flying in. Also i had no idea that they were going to add the doolittle raid after the attack. I was very happy because when the pearl harbor scene ended I DIDNT WANT THE MOVIE TO END!! i wanted to keep watching.

I never intended to watch this movie because of all the bad critic reviews and because it starred Ben Affleck (sorry, I'm not a fan of his).  Anyway, I went to my father-in-law's one day with my husband and had actually taken some needlework to do while he worked on his computer. My father-in-law offered to let me watch the movie and so as to not hurt his feelings I said sure, I'd watch it.  I must tell you I was in for a big surprise.  About fifteen minutes into the movie my needwork was forgotten.  I was completely absorbed in this movie.I don't understand all the negative reviews.  Come on people, the movie isn't that bad.  Everybody compares it to Saving Private Ryan.  Newsflash...  this isn't Saving Private Ryan, it's Pearl Harbor.  I thought this movie was done in an excellent way considering it is about an actual event.  The writers and directors stayed with the facts and recreated them well.  The attack scene was brilliant.  The actors did a great job of portraying their characters.  I even liked the love story.I have purchased the DVD (I seen the VHS version at my father-in-laws).  The DVD includes two very great bonuses:  The Making of Pearl Harbor and the History Channel's Unsung Heroes.  These two bonus features are worth the price of the DVD even if you aren't too crazy about the movie.To sum it up I thought this was a great movie.  I've watched it twice within a month.  I'm not a big war movie fan but this movie grabs your attention and won't let go until the end when you are left wanting more.  Don't pay attention to the bad reviews, buy it or even rent it yourself and watch it.  I think you'll like it.  It's a keeper!!	5.0	Why all the negative reviews??	2002-01-14	13	6	7
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AGKPTMTR3UX1R	"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here"""	"Given its immense sweep, its intense subject matter, and the caliber of its production values, PEARL HARBOR should be a Five Star shoo-in. That it isn't has nothing to do with the retelling of the history. which is accurate within moderate limits and powerfully presented. The battle sequences are grand set-pieces with plenty of pyrotechnics and action.Where PEARL HARBOR lets the viewer down is its insistence on exploiting every war-movie cliche in the book. That by itself might be endearing, but the three lead characters, badly mishandled, reduce this movie from David Lean proportions to Nora Ephron economy size. Not that there's anything wrong with Nora Ephron pictures, but to tell the story of Pearl Harbor in film, a director needs characters with a Zhivago-like passion, not a YOU'VE GOT MAIL romantic-comedy blandness.Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) are lifelong friends who both love to fly, both join the Army Air Corps, both take up duty at Pearl Harbor, and both participate in the ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" Doolittle Raid of 1942 (Alec Baldwin plays a more-than-passable Jimmy Doolittle). As buddies, Rafe and Danny work wonderfully together. They become heroes at Pearl, managing to get airborne to shoot down seven Japanese planes together (a fictional turn that works well).The fly in the ointment is Kate Beckinsale, or rather Kate Beckinsale's character, Evelyne, or rather, what gets done with Evelyne. The love triangle that develops between Evelyne and Danny and Evelyne and Rafe is hackneyed, predictable, and vaguely unappetizing. It is a major failing that brings PEARL HARBOR down several large notches. Evelyne's emotional shift from Rafe to Danny (though understandable under the circumstances) is so complete and she is so without regret that Evelyne becomes a cruel, unsympathetic and undesirable woman. The viewer is left to feel that Rafe and Danny are sacrificing their brothers'-bond for a worthless and wanton woman.This is tragic, because up until that point, Kate Beckinsale is perfectly desirable as the Forties pin-up dream girl (and she looks lovely in a starched white nurse's uniform, to boot). It seems that Danny and Rafe feel the same way, because their anger toward each other flares and sputters unconvincingly. In the end, it's obvious that they love each other far more than either of them loves Evelyne. And perhaps that's all for the best.By focusing more on this contrived love triangle and less on the characters' response to their role as unwitting participants in history, PEARL HARBOR doesn't make the grade."	3.0	"""Pearl Harbor"" gave me a sinking feeling"	2010-09-27	1	1	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AWYL41GBZJ1UR	"K. Ooi ""logansparkster"""	The first hour of the movie was a bit slow, when the romance between Ben Affleck's &quot;Rafe&quot; and Kate Beckinsale's &quot;Evelyn&quot; character were developed. But when Pearl Harbor was bombed, the effects were awesome, and the killing were so realistic. I was a big fan of computer effects - but I can barely concerntrate on the special effects cause I was so shaken by the realistic effect of how Pearl Harbor was attacked. Bay and Bruckheimer put a lot of gore here - and my heart just leap everytime people died. It makes me think, and seeing the mass amount of our people die during the bombing sequence was not a pleasant sight. It affects a part of me as a mankind. I am not that kind of person to cry in movies but this was different (heck I did not even cry in Titanic) - but you see so much despair, shock, sadness, pain when the pearl harbor was bombed that you just feel the same in your heart. The love story development was just so so (Kate Beckinsale did a GOOD job in acting when it comes to triangle of love) but it is the feeling of patriotism that matters at the end. It is a good movie overall - and I am going back to watch it again for the second time - this time concerntrating on the special effects. Mind you the effect are very detailed (ie the plane coming out of the smoke - with some part of the smoke swirling as went thru the propellor). And I have never seen Kate Beckinsale plays such role before. She was good in brokendown palace - but she looks different in this movie. Overall it is a good movie with awesome effect. Oh by the way just ignore what the critics say okay - some have to high of an expectation with the movie - I am sure that they find faults in everything that they watch. Even tho it is slow the first hour, it is still worth it. Just stop criticizing and sit back relax (or maybe you will not be relaxed, you might be shaken like I did) and just enjoy the show. And you know that I do have good opinion on the movie as I never like to write review to any movies. But my heart was propelled to write one for this show. Way to go Bay and Bruckheimer!

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A394QOHWJWK265	Kristan Johnson	I consider this movie to be about the middle of the road.  It's not a complete waste of time, but it is not Shakespeare either.  Two pilots fall in love with the same woman, then Pearl Harbor, and a subplot that feels a little like it was tagged onto the ending to provide resolution.  The actual bombing of Pearl Harbor was about what I hoped it would be, my only complaint about that part is that the camera whirls around a lot, making it difficult to focus on anything.  I understand stylist reasons directors choose this method for presenting battle, but it goes on for quite a while.  We don't really get into the situations of the men involved in the battle beyond the pilots, and we only see two of them make it into the sky (guess which two).  It's already been said, but I'll mention it as well, Cuba Gooding is really underused. The build up to the title event is not really a build up at all. One pilot courts a nurse.  That's fine, except that we go through the whole thing again with the other pilot courting the same nurse.  This takes so much time, and distracts from what the movie should be focusing on. After the bombing has occurred, the movie goes on for a while more, and resolves it's tangled triangle the easy way.  I think the movie is okay, but lacking in a few ways.  Regardless of how I feel about the movie, I will defer to the veterans and their own feelings about it.	3.0	Pearl Harbor	2001-05-27	0	0	0

Ross ""Kristy"""	Michael Bay's re-creation of the historic Pearl Harbour is a visually stunning, yet emotionally puerile film that lacks the frenetic fun of Bay's earlier films. Why Jerry Bruckheimer and Bay ever considered this mammoth of a movie is anyone's idea (stick to dumb action films guys), and the love triangle of Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale is frankly mind-numbingly-awful. While the huge battle scenes for the attack on Pearl Harbor are impressive, the film loses stars for being far too cardboard and unrealistic. But it is impossible to deny that the colossal battle scenes, bombs, big things exploding and action are really good, making for an impressive action film that is enjoyable if you can stand the yucky emotion.	3.0	Pearl Harbor	2002-05-12	2	1	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A34MZPBGHQ9F5I	Kristy Parton	I went to the theatre to see this disaster of a film knowing that I shouldn't expect a Saving Private Ryan.  I didn't expect the film to be some of the most painful movie-viewing hours of my existance.While the film had a few bright spots such as Dan Akroyd and Cuba Gooding, Jr., the point here would be that they were only spots.  These characters (who were based on real people), especially Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s, were more interesting than the three main characters.  Unfortunately, the movie wasn't about them, and their parts actually made the movie even more horrible by adding nothing to the already choppy storyline.  The most annoying of these wasted characters was Cuba Gooding Jr.'s, who seemed injected into the film just so that Bruckheimer could say &quot;Look, I put an important African-American in my movie!&quot;And then there was the love story.  One of the worst things about the love story was not that it was &quot;done&quot;, but that it was &quot;done&quot; in 1950s soap operas (even they have to come up with something more entertaining than the old love triangle nowadays).  The other is that it overshadowed the attack on Pearl Harbor.  This wouldn't bother me as much (I mean, these are the guys who made Armageddon, for crying out loud) except that the film was titled &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; and was advertised as a war movie that was meant to honor those who served.  The soap opera love triangle could have happened in ANY scenario and did nothing more to honor our servicemen who fought than yesterday afternoon's episode of Days of Our Lives.If you are looking for mindless entertainment that feels like Armageddon, sure, this is your film.  If you want a movie that lives up to its advertising as a serious war epic, rent Tora! Tora! Tora! or Saving Private Ryan.  If you want something that is a good old-fashioned war movie, go find something with John Wayne in it.	2.0	A Painful Movie-Going Experience	2002-01-08	17	8	9

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A31OBI94PGBS3V	Krzysiek	A decent war movie seems to be an endangered specie... If you must see Pearl Harbor, that is your problem, but I have to tell you that I cannot decide if I should laugh or cry. Impossible plot, disregard for any historical fact, apart of the actual bombing, shallow as a grave. from where did they find such a genius screenwriter?The plot is as dumb as 500th piece of Brasilian soap opera (no offence to Brasilians, though).My personal best is the main hero being shot down in full sun and emerging from the waters in the night (and close to shores of Spain or something...instead of middle of the English Channel). Worldwide record in underwater swimming without aqualung, my congratulations!!!!!!!!!! Plus many anachronisms, plus absolutely no idea of the movie whatsoever besides waving the flag. Also waving the flag could be done intelligently! For reference please see really good war movies and Americans did quite a few of them.PS I actually decided to laugh for about a half of the movie.PS PS One star is far too many...	1.0	absolute Brasiliana	2002-02-05	1	1	0

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AEI0AYDUQ63EK	Kurt Stoehr	The obviously over-done love story might be forgiven if it wasn't for the fact that they blew it as far as historical accuracy is concerned. Example: even though they had multi-Ghz of CGI working for them, they still used old T-6 'Texan' trainers as faux-zeros. A very old Hollywood trick.  Secondly, at one point they showed four destroyers line abreast being hit by high-level or dive bombers. Unfortnately you could quite plainly see the large, boxy superstructure of either Perry class or Aegis class frigates or cruisers (vintage 1980's),  not something designed or built in the late thirties. Also, the twin .50 cal mount used by Cuba Gooding Jr. hadn't been developed yet.Other than that, it should make for in interesting DVD.	3.0	Private Ryan meets Titanic	2001-06-22	1	1	0

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1I2XWGPTDX1MD	Kyle G. Lord	I just don't understand how this movie got so much criticism and thumbs-down remarks.  This is by far my favorite movie up-to-date, and it takes a really super movie to get me to say it's my favorite.  Alot of people said it was mushy and that the love triangle was unrealistic.  Some reviews went as far as to say that the action sequences and the bombing were way too fictional and computerized.....To begin with, let me just say that the World War II era fascinates me and I have read an enormous amount of literature (all true stories) from that time period.  I also had a grandfather who fought during World War II who told me an endless amount of first-hand stories when he was still alive......  I've read and heard the stories, I know the facts.... what Pearl Harbor portrays in both the fight scenes and personal lives of the characters is historically correct.  And the love triangle is not unrealistic.  Things like that happened and still happen all the time.  It is real life.  It is reality.So.... you haters need to stop hatin' and take this movie for what it is-- a heartwarming story of courage, patriotism, and true love that is vanishing more and more in our world of today.	5.0	Why are there so many haters in our world????	2008-10-17	6	2	4
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A30IP5D5DLHRPA	Kyle Slayzar	When I first went to go see this in theatres I was hoping for a historicly accurate, non-stop action war thriller.  What I got was a two hour love story and twenty minutes of the actual battle.  This movie was very disapointing and exceedingly boring for the first hour and a half.The emphasis is soley on the love interest between two hot shot pilots and some navy nurse.  One pilot (who is the boyfriend of the nurse) supposedly dies then his best friend takes over the love interest and gets laid in the parachute hanger with the nurse and makes her pregnant.  Almost the immediatly the so-called 'dead' boyfriend returns and all hell breaks lose between the two pilots.  Oh yeah, then the battle of pearl harbor happens.  Then the two go back to their disputes over who gets the girl.  They never settle their differences as they go off to seek their revenge on Japan by bombing them (which is historicly accurate, also known as the Dolittle Campaign) then the current boyfriend who pregnated the nurse dies (opps, spoiler) and the 'dead' pilot takes over... The End.The point of that is to explain that aside from special effect, their was almost no time and effort script wise spent on the historical relavence of Pearl Harbor which is what the hype previous to the movie's release was all about.  I only give this movie two stars because of the great special effects and nothing more.  However as George Lucas demonstrated in Phantom Mennace, special effects DO NOT make a movie.  All in all I would venture away from this movie and go with a quality, historicly accurate movie like Patton, Black Hawk Down or We Were Soldiers.	2.0	Two hour love story with 20 minutes of battle.	2002-11-27	2	1	1

It is truly heart-breaking to see those in such agony.But, we must remember how many Indians and African slaves were killed by Americans during 17 - 19th century.What if the Indians and the Africans slaves had had an advanced technology and made their sufferings into a movie like Pearl horbor? - depicting Millions of Indians including infants and pregnant womens being kileed American soldires and African slaves being apart from their homeland and killed by thier masters without doning anything wrong. Our heart must have had been broken to see Indians and African slaves losing their lives in the fate which was not their choiceKnow this fact - we tend to magnigy what we can see ourselves, expecially though a vivid visual-image made by a high-technology, and tend to neglect what we were not able to see due to the lack of availbility of such tech.  .Know another fact - WHO can have such tech and the capital that can afford it?  It is Hoywood movie indutury.Looks like it is one who have money that can CREATE truth and circulate it throught the world making it natural and self-evident.Please, please, pleasedon't mix what is real with that which is made up at the mercy of money and high-tech.	1.0	What if Indians have had a movie industry???	2005-08-24	19	5	14

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A36T2TEF5SKPUM	Laon	I don't mind dumb, and I especially like big dumb explosions, so I enjoyed about 20 minutes of this movie: the actual Pearl Harbour attack is great.But to get there you sit through a wafer-thin love story: girl meets boy, boys seems to get killed, girl takes up with boy's best friend, then - surprise! - 1st boy turns out not to be dead.  Though I don't know if anyone was surprised by that Shock Twist.Before the Pearl Harbour attack an awful waste - I mean &quot;waste&quot; as in &quot;vast empty desert&quot; - of time occurs while three mannequins, two male, one female, each flatter than cardboard, read out unbelievably flat, cliched dialogue at each other.  It probably only took up an hour or so of screen time, but in the theatre it felt like days.Affleck, Beckinsale and Bay's acting is not ... outstandingly good or bad; the real problem is an absolute clunker of a script, dragging out the dull exposition of a plot nobody could reasonably care about.  I wasn't the only one squirming with boredom until the Explosions Came.When the Japanese airforce finally turn up, it's like the 5th Cavalry arriving to save the film.  People have complained the film is anti-Japanese; actually it does make some effort to present the Japanese side (though not mentioning the unprovoked US navy shelling of Tokyo in the 19th century, which is not _entirely_ unrelated to the Japanese revenge some decades later).But all seriousness aside, when the Japanese planes arrived it's a grand sight and it lifts the movie no end.  People who've been sitting through the day-time sudser of a plot, to that point, could hardly be blamed if they wished that a couple of Zero pilots would get the main cast in their sights and ... I mean, the Japanese were aggressors, Hitler's allies, and did unspeakable things during the war, etc, but this film is so tedious that it actually had me cheering the Japanese on.  So in its own way this US film helps the cause of international harmony.  If not the cause of film-making.Basically, there's enough special effects in this movie's three hours to make a really exciting rock video.  But there's not much else.  And for that video you'd still have to choose your own music.  The film's own score is as flat and uninteresting as the script, even in the KA-BLAMM! sequence.In short, this is another film where they put more thought into a single explosion than they put into the entire script.  Eventually someone will notice that you can't make a flm that way: in the meantime the good news is that a screenwriter's strike wouldn't affect the production of films like this, one way or the other.Cheers!Laon	2.0	Twenty minutes of explosions, plus a day-time soap plot	2001-08-22	16	11	5

It was one of the most emotional three hours of my life, how could you not empathise with these people. Things like that really happened, men really were trapped in ships such as the Arizona and that is why i took such an interest. Maybe it did have something to do with the fact that Josh Hartnett was in it, but it did me the world of good, it made me realsie the importance of innocence, life and to appreciate what i have in life. It's an eye opening experience, but i feel i've learnt something.

I was so looking foward to what I thought would be the exciting blockbuster of 2001. Instead I found Pearl Harbor to be boring, cheezy and very predictable.  First of all it takes FOREVER for any sort of action to get started.  My husband and I were sitting in the theater just waiting for the Japanese to start bombing Pearl Harbor, almost looking foward to it, so we could see something interesting happen on the screen. The romance between the two leads is Laugh out Loud ridiculous.  The dialogue seems to be written by a 14 year old.  I was actually reciting out loud what the characters would say next, it was that predictable.  The story didnt let the audience become at all attached to the characters.  The only reason I give it 2 stars was the great special effects.  Dont waste your time on this dumbed down version of history.  If you want to watch a great movie depicting history see 13 Days or Tora Tora Tora.  Movies like that actually treat the audience like they have a brain.	2.0	SNORA! SNORA! SNORA!	2001-09-08	12	9	3

Most of the rest is Bruckheimer's obsession with explosions.As to the physical tragedy, it is so Hollywood-ized it is hard to take seriously. On the other hand, I felt like a voyeur, since I knew it was based on history.I had hoped the movie would give some idea of the psychology of America during and before WWII, but it did not. Just some laborious boy-girl stuff done much better in, say, Luzhin Defense or American Beauty. It did feel contemporary in showing the obtuseness of our military ""leaders"" (done better on The West Wing).There is one truly excellent scene involving President Roosevelt. To the best of my knowledge, that scene is 100 percent fiction but whoever created / scripted that scene (surely not the screenwriters who did the rest of this sub-par movie), deserves a lot of credit.The acting?

No such luck here. Both Bruckheimer and Michael Bay should have been banished from Hollywood for this mess. Or, better yet, Bruckheimer should have conned Tony Scott into directing it, since he seems to be the only director he can get consistently good results out of.In its favor, though, the lush Technicolor cinematography and ILM's frighteningly realistic visual effects almost draw attention away from the wooden acting and turgid love story. Too bad you have to sit through nearly an hour of said love story before you get to the movie's showpiece: the destruction of the Arizona. If you want something to show off your home theater setup, just cue this section up, and make sure you're playing back the DTS track. Oh, yes, and make sure you have enough to pay for any broken windows, cracked plaster and/or blown speakers that may result...Maybe instead of releasing an extended version, they should have considered putting out a much shorter version.

Let there be no mistake who the target audience was: young teenage girls.The special effects in the attack scene were amazing, but the story was a blatant rip-off of Titanic and Top Gun (even down to the pilots buzzing the air control towers and having a character named ""Goose""). Overall, this movie didn't come close to all the hype around its release. I was thoroughly disappointed when the movie was over.

Millinger	how can you not like this movie?first of all it had great special effects and the love story was very romantic and it fit in well with the action.most of you would compare it to Titanic which made a huge amount of money at the box offices.but Pearl Harbor was not all lovely dovey and mush.i see titanic that way all they did was pay focused on Jack and Rose.in this movie they payed attention to what the Japeneese were thinking and followed them through out the first half of the movie until the attack.they also had great special effects when the bombing took place.and this also had information about Pearl Harbor and had history included.i thought that it was very neat how they included the president at that time and what his plans were.i mean you can't say there was no learning experiance in there.i learned quite a bit new things about Pearl Harbor that i had not known before.Also for teens out there.there was a hunky herion Ben Affleck.but he not only was the heroin he did a very good job making the movie and playing the part.his Character was probably my favorite.he seemed to know what he was doing and he did well.the costumes and things were outstanding!i thought they did a great job on showing what people wore in the forties.they caputed a lot of different costumes including what the uniforms looked like at that time period.i think this movie was the best that i have ever seen.it's so much more better than titanic it's unbelieveable!pearl Harbor will deffiently be my favorite movie.i mean who else can make a movie where there are so many different special affects.this movie was a very expensive one to film.i enjoyed it very much and i think it was deffintley worth it.	5.0	The Best	2001-07-03	7	3	4
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1URL5GTZY0E9W	Lemmy Caution	A better Pearl Harbor attack film is 1970's Tora Tora Tora, made at a time when CGI didn't exist (and before Ben Affleck's career existed).  Those filmmakers had to rely on models, matte shots, and sometimes real airplanes, ships & explosions for their special effects.  Also, Tora Tora Tora takes a straightforward, almost docu-drama approach to this historical event -- no cheesy love triangle, thank heaven -- and its performances and dialogue are almost like Citizen Kane next to 2001's Pearl Harbor.What does Pearl Harbor (2001) have going for it?  Very good, often thrilling, visual design -- photography, sets and mostly (I'd guess) computer-generated special effects...and not much else.  The attack on Pearl Harbor is excitingly shot & edited.  Otherwise I thought the equally dumb characters & dialogue from Independence Day had been digitally copied and pasted into Pearl Harbor.  Just skip the pre-attack DVD chapters and watch the Japanese bomb Hawaii.  Then take the disc out of your machine, do yourself a favor and watch Tora Tora Tora.  You'll be glad you did.	3.0	3-Star Rating for Visual Design Only -- Very Bad Screenplay	2010-02-16	3	2	1

A combination of great  music, special effects, loyal friendship, everlasting love and sad tragedy, Pearl Harbor is the best movie in 2001!When I first saw the movie, I immediately loved it! I saw it four times in the cinema and dreamed of owning it on a video - that dream became a reality. :o)That's all I have to say - this movie really is nice, do not listen to critics' reviews - they always find a nice movie to pick on!

Some reviews say that it was a cheesy and predictible movie and that it was a copy of Titanic, but I think they are very much mistaken.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A321QDKGBFFHMT	"Leonard Dahlke ""Ummmmm"""	Here's an idea for a movie. Spend over 200+Mil on a historical epic with no script.This film is an abysmal disgrace. Instead of a respectful and reasonably accurate portrayal of one of America's most defining moments in history. We get a bloated star vehicle for a very badly directed Ben A. and Cate B.While the visuals are truly magnificent I found myself laughing out loud at the utter blather used as dialog in this film. Not to mention the spectacularly overblown love triangle used to milk more mileage as a non-exhistent plot.If you buy this disc wanting to learn more about Pearl Harbor your much better off buying or renting Tora Tora Tora. Nope the visuals are not as epic. But the level of respect and historical accuracy are much more on par with the impact that Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. The movie Pearl Harbor is pure and simply Visual Velvetta.  Processed cheese product. It gets my vote as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Don't get suckered in by the hype......it's really bad.	1.0	Tora Tora Tora!!!	2001-12-16	0	0	0

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3TGSLLCGWP9C9	"""limespider"""	This movie was everything I thought it would be...and that's not saying much.  I predicted every Hollywood gimmick but held off writing a review until I had actually seen the movie.  It's not that the acting was bad; I actually like Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale and can accept the fact that this is a love story set against the backdrop of Pearl Harbor.  But it would have been so easy to make the &quot;non-fiction&quot; parts of the story factually accurate but that was not the case.Once the two protagonists finally got to their P-40's, they subsequently downed 9 Japanese, four of which occurred in a ridiculous head-on game of chicken.  This was two more than Taylor and Welch, the real life pilots they were portraying, shot down.There were an incredible number of bombs being dropped on hospitals and civilian areas.  According to one source (I think it was Toland) only one bomb was actually dropped on Honolulu.  Most of the civilian deaths were from U.S. anti-aircraft shells landing in town.  Let's think about this logically.  The Japanese sent six aircraft carriers to pound the Pacific fleet so they would be unhindered in their conquest of eastern Asia.  Carrier based bombers (Kates and Vals) can only hold one torpedo or two 250kg bombs and your mission, if you are a Japanese pilot, is to destroy anything that can be used against your army or navy.  Are you really going to waste your precious ordinance on a few fleeing nurses or a base hospital?Then there was the Oklahoma.  This movie prop was so obviously on hydraulics as it slowly capsized at a constant rate.  In reality, once a ship's center of gravity shifts past the critical point, it capsizes relatively rapidly.  Also, in the movie, the Oklahoma is shown capsized 180 degrees with both propellers exposed.  In fact, the Oklahoma capsized to about 140-150 degrees exposing only the starboard propeller.Finally, the aerial sequences were simply awful.  Exciting, but completely Hollywood.  Pilots might be brave but they aren't stupid.  They don't weave in between the masts of closely moored battleships or follow 20' behind burning Me-109's.  Rent the 'Battle of Britain', which makes generous use of actually wartime footage, for a more accurate portrayal of aerial combat.If you are unburdened by facts and a desire for accuracy,  I suppose 'Pearl Harbor' was not a bad movie.  But 'Tora,Tora,Tora' is so much better I fail to see the point of this new release other than making more money for Hollywood.	2.0	Poor mix of fact and fiction	2001-06-04	4	3	1

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A17FLA8HQOFVIG	Linda Linguvic	The cinematography in this film is excellent, the long battle scene displaying the best in modern computer-generated technology.  Somewhere, however, there is a good story line, characters to care about and a way to feel the mounting tension that existed in 1941 when the U.S.A. was on the brink of war.  I know there is because I felt it all in the much more unsophisticated technically 1953 film  From Here to Eternity actually shot in black and white.  Somewhere there is a good film about General Doolittle's raid on the Japanese mainland, which changed the direction of the war; that's Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo, produced in 1944.  And somewhere is a film using modern film techniques, which also captures the essence of a great a sorrowful tragedy; I felt this in the film Titanic.O.K. - so with all the media hype and some wonderful films which set an example for the producers, they DID have a rough act to follow.  But give me a break!  They had $135 million to work with and the most technologically advanced equipment that money can buy.  So why, oh why is this film such a loser?(1)  This is easily one of the most inane love stories I've ever seen.  Most romantic comedies have better plot, and so do daytime TV soap operas.  Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale were burdened with this silly tale of the arrogant fighter pilot who meets the nurse while taking an eye test.  He can't read his letters because he gets them confused and she is about to flunk him but he makes a pitch to her about why that won't affect his ability to fly.  She feels sorry for him and passes him.  Of course, later, he has no trouble writing or reading love letters but by that time nobody cares.  The rest of the plot is equally silly.  I never got involved with the characters, never cared on whit about their silly romance and found myself giggling at their dialog.(2)  The history was much too general.  I yearned for more facts, more details of what was going on at the time.  There is one dramatic scene where President Roosevelt inspires his cabinet by forcing himself to walk without crutches but I understand that this never happened.  Which makes me think why the author made something up when there were so many real life known experiences that were equally, if not more dramatic. Also, There is absolutely no depiction of why the war happened in the first place, except for some vague remark by the Japanese commander that we had cut off their way to get oil and they had just enough left for 18 months.  Perhaps the writer thought that the need for oil was the only thing that a modern audience could relate to, which insults everyone's intelligence.(3)  The battle scene was indeed spectacular and lasted for a full 40 minutes on screen.  Some of the images where upsetting, but I thought more about the technical effects than I did about the devastation.  Again, it was much too general.  I wanted to be more aware about the strategies and about the different ships.(4)  Cuba Gooding Jr. is a good actor; his performance shone in Men of Honor.  His very tiny role as the African-American cook who won distinction for firing on the Japanese during the attack, was good, but I couldn't help thinking about the difference between the two films and how lacking in inspiration Pearl Harbor was.(5)  The best part of the film was the last few minutes, when Alec Baldwin as General Doolittle commanded the raid over Tokyo.  Finally, I felt sense of battle; finally, I got involved in the movie.  Alas, though, it was over too soon.To its credit, I must say I wasn't bored.  The scenes moved quickly, almost too quickly in some parts. As we all knew the attack was coming, it needed more tension.  And too much time was spent on the silly love story.  But as either a great film or a memorial to the Americans who lost their lives that fateful day, it was sorely lacking.	3.0	Sorely lacking in what would have made this film great	2001-11-06	9	7	2

I have many reasons why I gave this movie such a low rating. Firstly, it didn't live up to its hype. It was supposed to be a movie depicting the events that took place at Pearl Harbor, but then it seemed to me as if it focused more on the cliched love triangle between the leading roles than what it claimed to.*takes back the tissue* And it even failed to touch me very much, even with 2 hours of non-stop emotion.The 2 stars came from the brief war scene, its pseudo-saving grace.I don't recommend this film, lest you're into romance and such.

Nothing about this movie ring true and it have to be one of the most insulting movies to Pearl Harbor veterans ever made - even if you happened to be a Japanese veteran! None of the characters are believable, the love interest felt so superifical that you are in awe of the actors who actually went through the motion. The attack on Pearl Harbor have to be one of the greatest fisco ever shot on film. All the fake smoke, noise and destruction. Worst of all were the manipulative emotional chain yanking. The sad thing was, the attack on Pearl Harbor was so poorly done that it almost look comical and unless you are a total dunce, you know that you are having your chain yanked so entire sequences looked like a put on job. I can't believed that they opened this movie on an aircraft carrier at Pearl Harbor with invited veterans of the attack. What a torture that must have been!! Funny thing about this movie was that nothing worked. Love story don't work, military history don't work and acting don't work. I think the movie insulted just about every one involved presently and all those who were there back in 1941.	1.0	Its not entertaining, its not history and a bad movie...	2003-12-12	51	37	14

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2O9MQO5C8ECX4	Lori Lynn Swift	Pearl Harbor is flat out enjoyable. Yes, the love story is overdone, some of the action is overdone, and there were a few liberties taken. However, I did not say Pearl Harbor was a cinematic masterpiece. It's just the type of movie that leaves you wishing you could watch it one more time (as long as you take a short intermission).The DVD features plenty of special features and provides just enough information regarding the actual events surrounding December 7. In fact, my only beef with the DVD is that there will be a special three disc version released in May.If you consider yourself emotional or patriotic, then I find it hard to believe that you would not be able to find anything to enjoy in this movie. Jon Voight is amazing as FDR and the attack sequence is disturbingly real (come on, it's rated PG-13).In the end, Pearl Harbor serves as an excellent reminder to what happened on December 7. Pearl Harbor may have a few too many explosions, or a little too much love, but it will still leave you in awe.	5.0	Fools! All of you!	2001-12-03	2	1	1

Because it's trying to be like Titanic but it doesn't even come close.  First of all, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet made the audience believe they are in love and that is not the case with Pearl Harbor's stupid love triangle.  Ben Affleck is a terrible actor and Kate Beckinsale does a good job of being one of the worst actresses of our time.  Josh Hartnett does what he can with the poorly written role he was given, but the only good performance comes from Cuba Gooding, Jr.  His performance was emotional and amazing, but that was the only good thing about this film.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A12E7NGN4VU4SP	"L. Peyronnin ""liquidlen"""	"This movie is absurdly bad. A white elephant. From the start, when you see Alec Baldwin, as an Army Air Corps officer, ordering a couple of US Army pilots to Britain to fight Germans in British RAF fighters, you know this flick is BS. America was a neutral in 1940, no US armed service personel were ever sent that year or the next to fight in the British air force. There was an American squadron that saw service flying British fighters in the Battle of Britain, but they were all volunteer mercenaries, who showed up in the UK dressed in civies. The only thing the US gov't would have done, in the case of the actual mercenary pilots, was to refrain from cancelling their visas, and let them go over. The two aforementioned pilots whom Baldwin sends, Afleck and that other guy, then proceed through the movie, through every major aviation event of the war, like they're Batman and Robin; reaching their climax as participants in the Dolittle Raid (which, it turns out, is Baldwin's role, Col. Dolittle himself, which heightens the bogus nature of this ""historical"" production) The romance parts are a real tedious chore to have to put up with, the HOT stuff that From Here to Eternity provided and still provides this is not. There is not a Burt Lancaster or Donna Reed or Sinatra to be found among this pathetic High School drama class calibre cast. The Maudlin atmosphere is so strong that one is forced to notice further slop handling of details on the part of the producers.  The director, back when this was released, bragged about the time and resources spent on producing the special effects ""this movie is all about special effects"" I remember him saying. Yeah, and apparently not about accuratly recounting history. Even then, the much ballywhod special effects are a dissapointment. You want to see a still competant film account of Pearl Harbor? Check out Tora!Tora!Tora! It still stands and delivers as a representatiion of these events. Want the weeks leading up to Pearl Harbor presented as sultry times for romance? Then go for the eforementioned From Here to Eternity. Stay away from this turkey.

The movie has a flat drama, kinda stupid characters (with few exceptions), and a romance filled with hollow dialogues that reminds me of the love scenes between Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala on ""Star Wars-Episode  II: Attack Of The Clones"".  Hey, but at least Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale have more on-screen chemistry than Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen.  The only performers who have a touch of class on this Michael Bay film are Jon Voight as FDR, Colm Feore as Admiral Kimmel, Mako as Admiral Yamamoto, Dan Aykroyd as Captain Thurman and, especially, Alec Baldwin as Colonel Dolittle -these actors are great in their roles.  As for the main players...well...they are as flat as the drama.  The film's best selling points are the visual effects supervised by ILM's Eric Brevig, who won the Oscar for ""Total Recall"".Thank God for this Vista Series DVD edition, which is truly fantastic.  The four discs are full of extras that are far better than the movie itself.  The making of ""Pearl Harbor"", as well as the production diaries, are outstanding extras.  The documentaries from The History Channel are very informative.  The making of the visual effects is perfect for FX fans such as me.  The only thing I really regret is that there is not an isolated music track with Hans Zimmer's spectacular score.  And let's not forget the package's presentation: I think the people at Disney did an incredible job in it.In conclusion, ""Pearl Harbor"" fails in giving a very decent drama, but the attack scenes are very well shot, and that's something I've got to hand it to Michael Bay, in spite of the gory scenes in his director's cut, which I find repulsive and unnecessary.  If you ask me, I stick with ""Tora, Tora, Tora""."	4.0	This Is One Hell Of A DVD Edition	2002-07-13	5	1	4

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A20IOTRKF4YRM7	LuKus McAll	Starring Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett, Pearl Harbor tries to touch on the same premise as Titanic (love story in a historical event) but misses the punch of drama. The romance between Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale is far from timeless, Jack and Rose is the epitome of classic romance.Great visual effects make up for all the faults. This movie does feature some of the more realistic and compelling dog fights in film history. I don't mean dog dog fights, its a figure of speech about the air battles between the good guy and the bad guys.	4.0	Good fun	2001-08-10	1	1	0

I openly wept, as did most of the audience, during many of the scenes.  I do not think there was a dry eye in the  ENTIRE audience of young men, young women, adult men and women. I sat in a packed theatre next to a 14 or 15 year old boy who wept right along with me.  We learn so much from this epic movie. Veterans of this World War have every right to stand as tall as they can!  I'm fortunate to say that it's given me a new appreciation of what my relatives fought for and gained for me!

(...)If you want a movie that will make you cry and give you a little taste of history then this is the movie that you want to see. If you are expecting a totally actuate account of Pearl Harbor then you are going to be disappointed. But when you watch this try to remember that there has NEVER been a truly accurate Hollywood film that told history like it really happened, so just sit back and enjoy a movie that has a touching story of love and friendship.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3OVY0G194HPYK	Lydia M Ramos	Ok, I have read a million different reviews for this film. And I personally think that most of the authors are sadly mistaken.I must agree that it may not have been Afleck's best part, but at least he was exploring a new endeavor. I don't think it's right to attack someone for trying new things! Now, second of all Michael Bay and Bruckheimer NEVER ONCE claimed this movie to be a documentary. People are bashing this film for some of the innacurate details and for some of the major parts of the real event that was left out of the film. And I am so sick and tired of reading about it. This movie was about getting the feel of the personal side of that war. That the attack affected people's lives in a tremendous way. Everytime I watch it I try to put myself in a similar situation. And am devastated each time. So for anyone who enjoyed the personal side of Titanic and Armageddon I believe will enjoy this film! Have fun all!!Oh, and anyone who enjoys beautiful music should buy/download the soundtrack. Especially the tracks &quot;Tennessee&quot; &amp; &quot;Brothers&quot;.	5.0	GREAT MOVIE	2002-03-16	3	1	2

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2LUCWMCYBVRZO	Madison Graves	"In the opening of Michael Bay's ""Pearl Harbor"", we find two boyhood friends, Rafe Mcawley and Danny Walker, at a farm. We learn that Danny's father is a broken war veteran turned abusive father. Rafe assumes the role as an older brother towards Danny, loyally looking out for him. The audience is then jetted into the future, months before the historical, ill-fated attack on the actual Pearl Harbor, where Danny (played by Josh Hartnett) and Rafe (played by Ben Affleck) - still best buds, but much older - are training. They are both excellent, daredevil pilots; however they are very different.... However, the two are very nice to look at on screen!... Beckinsale and Affleck have no chemistry, and I, personally, did not care about their relationship... Surprisingly, Hartnett and Beckinsale played off each other very naturally and I found myself laughing a little and feeling touched. Harnett was very compelling on screen, more so than Affleck (the supposed star) but perhaps I'm just being wooed by his good looks!The film picks up, and Bay did an incredible job at depicting the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle brigade. The special effects are dazzling and they will blow you away! Jon Voight portrayed Franklin Roosevelt and he had his character down to a T! Cuba Gooding Jr. also gave a great performance as an actual cook aboard one of the ships during the attack. However, his story was overshadowed and deserved much more time and development. Alec Baldwin delivered a laughable performance as an actual general, Doolittle, who led men to revenge on the Japanese attack. Dan Ackroyd also made, I guess what you would call a cameo, and he was great!!! But again, he was barely in the movie. Although the relationship between Rafe and Danny was pretty captivating, the romance (even for me, a girl) bored me to death. Affleck did what he could with his unbelievable lines, but Hartnett was very believable, he made me cry! Beckinsale was nothing amazing, but she did surprise me towards the middle of the movie - her character becoming more realistic and heroic. The supporting roles (the other nurses and men, etc) are your classic personalities and they added little to the movieI hungered for character development, the politics of this time period and symbolism. Bay could not handle all the different levels that are vital to a movie. ""Pearl Harbor"" could have been a really amazing, great movie - but it lacked originality and patience. Bay was so anxious to tackle the action of the movie (which he did wonderfully), that he overlooked and hurriedly rushed through all the other GREAT stories! Also, ""Pearl Harbor"" is basically just a combination of other war movies...Although ""Pearl Harbor"" bombed in my opinion, the romantic bliss of the beginning does provide a clear contrast and foreshadowing of the horror to come. And, the film is very effective and I feel, although it is more Hollywood, than history, it did give justice to those who actually experienced the attack. This movie is no masterpiece, that's for sure, and it won't get an academy award - unless it wins for something like sound or effects - but I have to recommend it. It really is pretty thrilling and entertaining, and it does move you! Hans Zimmer's score will form a lump in your throat! ""Pearl Harbor"" is a crowd pleaser, and I doubt many adults and teens won't like it... certainly one to see at the theatre. But, as a critic, I can't fall for the charismatic Josh (even though he did a great job and this should be a step up in his career) and it just disappoints me that Bay directed this film. If Spielberg had done it, it would have probably been up for 'Best Picture' or something... it really could have been great... oh well. But, despite MY attack on ""Pearl Harbor"" - go see it - it's worth it. No matter what the critics say, you are probably planning to see it - or have already seen it, any way."	2.0	another attack on Pearl Harbor - well, on the movie	2001-06-05	20	15	5

I bought this DVD from Amazon 2 years ago and finally watched it yesterday.As a WW2 buff who grew up in England, I enjoy most movies about this era, however this one was mediocre at best.The RC airplanes getting their wings blown off in every dogfight, crashing into towers and still being decipherable, weird 10 minutes with the English battles, 10 minutes at the end for the Doolittle raid, ridiculous love triangle, was not what I had hoped for.The actual main battle scene was good, but there were way too many pretty people in this movie to make it real.And there was plenty of fiction in this one.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1PGSWPBACX2PU	"M_Alexandra ""M_Alexandra"""	Was an excellent movie - particularly the cast, storyline - very much like a great 1940s/1950s b/w WWII flick - but made for today's audiences.The only thing that really bothered me was the historical revisionism for the sake of commerical gains in Japan (which usually accounts for 40% of overseas box office receipts). The movie-makers portray the Japanese decision to deliberately and intentionally bomb and kill thousands of Americans at Pearl Harbor - as some kind of unavoidable &quot;reaction&quot; to something America did. For those who know no better, especially the young, they may actually take the movie version as the real thing. How sad and tragic that would be - for all those American soliders who were killed then. As a sign of respect and rememberance, the movie-makers should have at least made an effort at the end of the film to clarify the historical facts.	4.0	...	2001-05-27	3	3	0

I am stationed Spain and I see this movie was made so the world would understand the suffering U.S went threw. The old action war movies where made to make us look like heroes, surprise many country don't buy it. The love story was necessary so we can care for the characters and show the emotions of suffering of the attack. With out that it is cold history book. I think many where expecting old American style movie when U.S end up being the heroes. I am very proud that they made this movie because my Spanish girlfriend finally understands Pearl Harbor suffering.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	ABO092BYA4VMU	Marco Freire	This film is OK, but it lacks story, yet the Pearl Harbor is intense and very well done, yet most of the action was computer generated. And the Director's Cut version of that battle scene is different from the theatrical release version of that scene.-Instead of whole soldiers being blasted out of sand bag barricades-  you see blood, limbs, and other body parts flying out of those same sand bag barricades.-During the movie's many strafing scenes, you now see huge chunks of meat and other body parts go flying from the falling people. And the shot of the two nurses ducking down by the fountain, you can now see a man's entire body gettingsevered by the 20mm guns of the strafing Zeros.-There are now several new scenes in Battleship Row of sailors on fire, getting shot, and being brutally dismembered by shrapnel. This also inculdes a really graphic shot of a severed head.-The scene with Miller and Capt. Bennion now has shots of Bennion holding his intestines in his hands and Miller trying to put them back in his body.-The hospital scenes now have graphic shots of battlefield surgery and amputations, as well as close ups of severed limbs laying on the floor.According to imdb.com, there are more changes in this Director's Cut, but I haven't found them yet. The Theatrical Version runs 3 hours, 3 minutes and is rated PG-13, and the much more gory Director's Cut runs a minute longer and is rated R.Film Rating (Both Versions) 5/10	3.0	Director's Cut differs a little from the theatrical version	2005-04-10	6	1	5
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	ASN36IA89EBD6	Marco	This would have to rank as one of the worst movies of all time. Overlong, boring, dreadful acting, embarrassing  screenplay. By the time you get to the battle sequence (meant to be the movie's centrepiece) you're so bored that you don't care what happens to any of the main characters. In fact, you end up hoping all the main characters die quickly so this pathetic movie will end. But I did find it very funny to listen to the dreadful dialogue, so at least I got some amusement from it.I actually found the battle scenes quite disrespectful to the memory of the men and women who died at Pearl Harbor. Scenes of people dying horribly using modern-cinema realism and gore was quite repulsive and offensive. I'm surprise Michael Bay was allowed to get away with it. As I watched the gore-fest that is the battle, I wondered what those people who died that day would think of the way their deaths were portrayed - like some ghoulish freakshow for us 60 years later to watch and say with a morbid smile on our face ... Oooooo ... ahhh ... yuck. It would have been much better if Bay had gone down the tasteful, respectful path rather than the shock, showman route.My favourite cringe-worthy lines -Alec Baldwin as the General (or whatever he was) - The heart of a volunteer is the noblest of all.Josh Hartnett, while looking at himself in the mirror wearing his uniform - (Crying) You know, whenever I see mahself in this here uniform .... I just don't feel like a hero. (Cries some more).Also cringe-worthy is the way the Japanese are portrayed in the movie. Whenever we see Americans, there is beautiful music playing behind images of pretty scenery and lovely, bright colours. Whenever the Japanese are shown, we see dark, grey tones and booming, dark, evil music thumping away. Cut back to Americans ... cue pretty music and bright colours. Talk about manipulate the audience's emotions, rather than Bay making his point in some subtle way ... like a good script.How can anyone think this piece of garbage is worth 4 stars?The soundtrack is incredible though. Hans Zimmer's score is truly wonderous. Its a pity his talent and genius was wasted on such trash.	1.0	Entertaining because its so bad	2007-01-12	10	8	2

There are no sexy beach scenes(ala Kerr-Lancaster) although one on a parachute(in a hangar on the ground) is somewhat creative as love scenes go. There is virtually little chemistry between Ben Affleck and Kate Beckingdale, but that is probably because Affleck's character woodenly states he is saving himself and her from an experience they may later regret.  The chemistry does begin though with the same leading lady and a second flyer who happens to be the Affleck character's best friend.The bombing of the battleships scenes are excellent. This was deadly warfare and America was a sitting duck not so unlike 9/11/01-note this last comment was inserted later by this reviewer.)

I am 16 years old and we are learning about WWII right now and after seeing this movie, I have to say it's pretty good, my history teacher even agrees with me.  When they started bombing Pearl Harbor I felt sad and terrified for all those men who had to die.  They do a really good job on that part.  Even the infiltration of Japan after Pearl Harbor, I can't remember the name of the mission, when they start to lose fuel over the ocean and so forth.  I think the whole love story was just leading up to the big bombing on Pearl Harbor and it was good background.  With nurses being called to duty and American volunteers helping the RAF (Royal Air Force) in England, it's all pretty much historically accurate.I think it's a wonderful movie.	5.0	I love it!	2006-04-13	10	6	4

It has it all, it's a love story, it has action, and even a litte humor. Seeing the film knowing that it isn't a documentary, I don't see why anyone would give it such horrible reviews. Pearl Harbor is just like Titanic. Take a tragic event in history, create some characters that you become attatched to, and feel what they are feeling.

The storyline is the best: they have enough of the love story and of the battle scenes. It is a wonderful representation of what happens during wars. Although all the actors are GREAT in it, there is one that I think is especially good - Ben Affleck. His performance is so wonderful because he makes it seem so real, like he really acted like a person would in his character's position. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; definitely deserves five stars because everything about the movie is excellent! The special effects are amazing! No matter what row you're sitting in, the movie makes you feel like you are actually there - especially in the battle scenes.

Ben Affleck just mouths his lines.  The only time I cared about any of the people in the film was the anonymous sailors and nurses who died in the attack.  What a hackneyed plot.  They wrote better &quot;B&quot; picture scripts in the 40's.  Where's Artie Shaw?Where's jive talk?  Where's the radio shows?  Parts of the attack are quite emotionally moving without being too manipulative which is the only reason I gave it 1 star.  If you're interested in the Doolittle Raid get &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; which has excellent SFX for its time and is a true story with first rate  actors and direction. Ignore the first half of the movie's bad plot - coming back from the dead, how many times have we seen that one on daytime television?  The middle 30 minutes are okay and at some points even spectacular, but Pearl Harbor should not be about &quot;Entertainment&quot; with a CAPITAL &quot;E&quot; and that's what all the pyrotecnics are there for it seems, just to entertain.

Many others have detailed the awesome badness of this film, so I won't list all the numerous problems Michael Bay has brought to the screen, however, two things trouble me after watching this disaster last night.1. The same Japanese actors played the same roles in 1970's Tora! Tora! Tora!  You'd think somebody'd promoted them by now.  But maybe the Japanese Imperial Fleet is a slow-promoting organization.2. As a father, I can definately tell you that somebody with Kate Beckinsale's figure who has conceived in December would not be wearing a tight dress in April.  Nor would she still be in the Navy in 1942.Armmegdon was so much fun.  What happened here?  I suppose messing with the future is easier than messing with the past.I blame Michael Bay. This movie is so bad for so long.  A Director's cut?  What did he leave out? Guadalcanal? Tarawa? Monte Casino?

Ben fights the Battle of Britain, Ben gets shot down and hides out with the French resistance, Ben escapes France and flies 1/2 way around the world and arrives in Hawaii one day before the Pearl Harbor attack.  Ben then jumps into a fighter, even though he is still technically a civilian because he left the service to fight in the RAF, and then proceeds to shot down Japanese attackers.  After a hard day of arial dog fights, Ben lands and proceeds to rescue trapped sailors at Pearl Harbor!  To cap it all off Ben jumps into Jimmy Doolittle group to fly bombers (even though he is a fighter pilot) and attack Tokyo.  I wonder why they left out Ben's contribution to the sinking of the Bismark and the Battles of El Alamein and Dunkirk?Throw in a tedious and unbelievable love triangle and you have an over reaching big budget snoozer.Special effects on the actual Pearl Harbor attack are very good, but hardly enough to make up for a terrible plot and equally terrible acting.	1.0	Awful	2004-02-24	45	33	12

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1DL3UBXXH0S0C	Mark Richman	This is a really long movie.  That's the universal first reaction to this movie by everyone I've spoken to who has seen it.That's not my main problem with it.  The problem is that this is a plot designed by checklist (kudos to Erik for the checklist comparison), if you can call it a plot.  Really, there are multiple stories in the movie with some relation to each other.First, there is the love triangle.  This story made me nauseous.  It was way too complicated and did not mesh well with the war story going on.  This movie is compared to Titanic, but at least that love story fit in well in the back drop of the boat and its disaster.Then, there's the attack and its preparations.  The parts with the Japanese were well done, though a little too brief.  Accusations of being anti-Japanese are ludicrous.  They do a good job of humanizing them.  I did think it was funny that Admiral Yamamoto came along with the strike force, instead of staying back in Japan (as he did historically).  I guess they thought multiple Japanese admirals (Admiral Nagumo was the actual commander of the strike fleet) would confuse American audiences.The attack scene is breathtaking.  I forgot that it was CGI graphics while viewing it.  The parts involving the main characters' dogfight was a little silly, and having modern, Spruance class destroyers sitting in the harbor was amusing, but it was almost worth the rest of the movie to see the attack scene.Apart from showcasing the valor of a heroic black cook who definitely rose above the call of duty, there didn't seem to be much of a point to Cuba Gooding, Jr's character being included.  I applaud recognizing the hero, but it did serve to complicate an already muddled film.Finally, the movie should have ended with FDR's &quot;A Day that Will Live in Infamy&quot; speech.  That would be an acceptable ending, even for Americans (since most Americans realize we won this war in the end anyway).  The Doolittle Raid seemed like a separate movie and was completely unnecessary.  If you want a happy ending, make a movie about Midway (preferably not by the makers of this movie).If you want to see a chick movie that guys can appreciate, skip this love story and see &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.&quot;  If you are curious about the amazing battle scene, rent it and fast forward through every thing with the main characters.	2.0	Movie by checklist	2001-06-08	4	3	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AWE0R9MSS9988	"""mark_sigel"""	This was a very good movie.  The development of the characters is what made the attack scene on Pearl Harbor what it was.  Other Ben Affleck movies he seems a bit [false] and his words are choppy, in this movie he was very fluent and his acting was great.The attack on Pearl Harbor was very realistic, and very exciting.  Of course this wasn't the only action in the movie, after the bombing, they take B52's and attack Japan, it is pretty much a suicide mission, but it turns out great, and if I could cry I would have there, :).If there is one flaw in the movie, it's that the actors were too dramatic, it seemed that every word out of Alec Baldwin's mouth could be put in the &quot;Big Book of Quotes.&quot;  The actor that played FDR was very dramatic too, I can understand that the bombing of Pearl Harbor wasn't a laughing matter, but they were both overly dramatic.Overall the acting was very good, and the filming was also very attractive, but a bit bumpy at times, I can't complain though.  This is a movie for everyone, some parts are a bit gruesome, but not as bad as &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; or &quot;Braveheart&quot; both great war movies, and romances.	5.0	Great Movie	2001-05-29	4	3	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1PFT63CY1EF3M	Mark Walters	Holy god this movie eats!  If you're a hopeful filmaker, then see this film...because you'll then know how not to make one!!  Why is it that when you combine the vomit-inducing names of Bruckheimer, Bay, and Affleck, the result is always some cheesed-up, explosion-filled, wannabe drama?!  That's the problem with this movie, it doesn't know what it wants to be, and neither do the characters.  The ever-nauseating affleck spends the whole 3 hours switching from one kind of character to another.  He can't figure out if he wants to be a goof ball, serious romantic, or stoic fighter...all of which he can't portray any better than a rock could!  Never mind the fact that his accent kept slipping. Basically, everything about this movie is bad (except obviously the visuals, but pretty pictures do not a movie make).  The casting was the first mistake, cause Affleck is bad in anything.  Every other actor might be good if the script was better.  They all spend most of their breath spouting out poorly-worded mindless drivel the likes of which have rarely ever been seen before!!  You can only hear lines like &quot;what will we be like after the war&quot; or &quot;i think world war 2 just started&quot; so many times before you have to stuff something in your ears!  Cuba's lines are especially cheesy.  He basically plays the same character that he played in Men of Honor, and it's not that good.  One thing that really surprised me was the music.  Hans Zimmer is normally known for creating original scores that really sound great...but not this time.  For some reason, he got lazy, turned into some sort of James Horner, and pretty much just reused the soundtrack from The Thin Red Line. A lot of the shots were directly taken from a good WW2 film, Saving Private Ryan.  The fade to an American flag and cinematography of rising and sinking in the water (raid on the beach), drowning out the sound when you're submerged.  That's blatantly not original, it's not even an homage. Let's see here...ah yes!  Predictability!  I called everything in this movie an hour before it occurred!  Nothing is surprising, not even when less famous actors die...hint hint.	1.0	3 hours too long!!!!	2001-05-25	10	8	2

This movie is an incredible trivialization of such an important historical event.It is also a fictional version. Doris Miller's actions were heroic, but he did not shoot down any Japanese planes. The pilots on whom the characters played by Ben ""Aflac"" and the other actor whose name escapes me were based did not down three Japanese planes by playing chicken with them. The attacking Japanese planes did not zip in and out and around ships and buildings like Star Wars TIE fighters.But why am I even bothering to go into this much detail? The movie is horrible.

Among the notable performances was that of the actor who portrayed President Rosevelt-marvelous job! The scenes of the actual attack are powerful and realistic. Few historical inaccuracies do not take away from the impact of the movie-it is a deep emotional reminder of the devastation, death and destruction that took place in Pearl Harbor. Thankfully, the viewer is spared the graphic and morbid scenes found in Saving Private Ryan which left nothing to the imagination.The movie includes an obligatory love story which is very trite and predictable, however the relationship between Ben Affleck and other leading characters provides diversion in the way of romance and humor.Cuba Gooding Jr. was a bit of a disappointment-no fault of his own, just poorly cast for a very minor supporting role. Difficult to understand why he was wandering the depths and bowels of the USS Arizona still carrying a silver tea platter and cups while planes were obviously bombing in very close proximity. Additionally hard to believe was the fact that although Honolulu was to suffer a &quot;surprise&quot; attack while the island was &quot;sleeping&quot;, the entire naval fleet were still in their bunks in the wee hours of the morn yet young boys were enjoying a baseball game and mothers were accompanying their children to church. Just didn't fit....Ben Affleck and his leading lady were believable even if corny. There was just enough chemistry to make hearts go pitter patter!The movie is definitely worth $7.50 and could even be nominated for some academy awards!	4.0	Worth Your Time	2001-05-28	5	3	2

What the viewer receives is a drawn out, Titanic-esque, melodramatic romance, with a 'smidgin' of battle to draw attention.  While the battle scenes are impressive, they don't make up for the other two hours of clich&eacute;d writing.World War II can be a touchy subject for artists to work with.  While I know that romance abounded during that time (how could it not, with soldiers leaving home and loved ones?), this movie SHOULD have focused more strongly on the battle...or else have the show renamed.If you want a *good* World War II movie, try &quot;Tora, Tora, Tora&quot;, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, or best yet, HBO's &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;.If you want bad romance and melodrama, try Titanic.	1.0	Vile...truly vile...	2001-12-04	4	2	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1EO7FZ8E1W7V0	Martin	"Shame on Randall Wallace for crafting such a horrible love story.  After the near-flawless ""Braveheart"" and much-above average ""Man in the Iron Mask,"" Wallace manages to create one of the lamest, most annoying, most insipid romances ever to hit the big screen (think of ""Titanic"" wand B movie dialogue crossed with ""Saved by the Bell"" and a wetted-down melted hunk of Velvetta).That having been said, the story doesn't really improve much if you leave out the romance.  Too many clich&eacute;s; too much dialogue that is DOA (dead on arrival).  And, oh no, not more Christ-symbolism at the ending.  It was hard enough to swallow at the end of Braveheart (Christ with a sword; er, OK), but here, it's shameless.The battle scenes, however, are good.  Not excellent.  Just good.  Which is also a shame.  But films like ""Platoon"" and ""Three Kings,"" and especially ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Black Hawk Down"" as well, have seriously raised the bar concerning the realism and accuracy of combat footage.  The scenes with the torpedoes zipping through the water beneath the sailor's limbs is a very effective scene, very memorable.  But the dog fights were marred by the silly dialogue.  (Ben Affleck can act --- he was very good in ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""Chasing Amy"" for example; but here he is not able to rise above the ineptness of the script.  --- Perhaps they should've let him cuss more?? -- maybe that would've helped.)There was also too little emphasis on the aftermath of the attack --- especially the stories of human struggle and loss.  (To this end, the History Channel documentary on the second disc does a fairly nice job of addressing this aspect).Gladiator, Saving Private Ryan, The Patriot, Heat, Braveheat -- to name a few -- are all worthy epic action pic alternatives to this one.Why two stars?  Because I just can't bring myself to completely pan something that portrays such a painful part of our and human history, one where so many lives were lost.There's a much better film to be made on this subject than this one."	2.0	An absolute travesty	2002-01-29	4	2	2

And another big mistake is that little ""2-men hero"" [show] that Ben & Josh managed to pull off during the attack. Not that it didn't really happen, but the whole thing pretty much concetrated on those two.

Treu	&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is a slight, predictable, soap-opera-genre, poorly written, poorly acted, corny, and oh so &quot;politically correct&quot; love story. It was designed, like its big-bucks pedicessor &quot;Titanic&quot; (with which it shares many of the above adjectives), only to make as much money as possible, apparently in a race to capture the big-bucks crown, never mind truth, accuracy or artistic merit.The trite, &quot;PC&quot; sanitized dialog makes it clear the film-makers (one cannot call them artists) were courting customers in Japan when they assembled the ingredients for this gallimaufry of corn, schlock, and sushi.Immediately after Japan's sneak attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, while America and Japan were at peace, headlines across America rang out: &quot;Japs bomb Pearl Harbor&quot;. Commentators wrote of the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; invading America, in response to the hateful imperialist attitude of the emperor and Tojo's cabinet; especially hateful towards America. One wonders if the &quot;film-folk&quot; were even aware of any of this.Just as &quot;A Night To Remember&quot;, with Robert Wagner and Barbara Stanwyck, is a better flick than &quot;Titanic&quot;, both &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; (see my review), and &quot;From Here To Eternity&quot; stand head and shoulders over this rather stubby film.Pearl Harbor is short on acting, short on story, short on accuracy, and short on &quot;raison d'etre&quot;.The long battle scenes depicting Americans being killed by the Japs and their hateful war machine, are the product of Hollywood special effects mavens playing with thier toys -- sometimes well done.This movie has bombed because of a deceitful Japanese presence in the American entertainment industry. It was not without thought of sanitizing their World War 2 atrocities that the Japs sought control of various American entertainment media. An effete, lame, limp-wristed approach to Japan's holocaust -- its methods and its motives -- makes this control very clear. It also makes &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; a waist of time and money.	1.0	Ignors Japan's WW2 imperialist aims, and hate for America!	2001-05-28	16	12	4

The scipt is terrible. Probably the most stereotypical plot possible for a war film, a woman loosing a man to war. I've seen that many times. Pearl Harbor has 2 hours of pathetic unoriginal footage. The only parts i cant complain much about are the action sequences because well, they came close to depicting war. However I thought Disney's desicion to not allow the film to be rated R was rediculous. It didn't make it seem as terrible as it was. Almost a lack of respect towards those who were at pearl harbor.If they weren't about to change the script so that the actual story [not the events of pearl harbor] were something new, the least stupid braukheimer could have done was shorten the thing to torture movie goers a little less.

I went up to one after it was over and he had tears in his eyes. It was a powerful movie and I felt for a moment as though I had actually been there. People say the love triangle in the film was trite. It did stretch things, but if you are a romantic like me, you'll not be bothered by it. How lifelike is Romeo and Juliet, considered a great classic? The characters in the movie are genuine. I really felt like I was looking at real people out of the 1940s. The battle scenes were really very good. The Japanese imagery of the &quot;Divine Wind&quot; was played up very effectively. I felt the sadness of the loss of fallen comrades. It was an interesting perspective to take the film from the bombing at Pearl Harbor to Doolittle's raid on Tokyo, but it made sense. All in all, a very enjoyable movie experience.

It speaks of how the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and would bait the U.S. into WWII. But before that, a group of pilots would return the favor with their own bombing attacks on the Japanese. Seeing all those U.S. sailors running for their lives when they were being attacked is truly scary. Much respect to the men and women of the armed forces.	5.0	Only get this movie on blu ray	2010-09-02	13	11	2

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1S46ANMN46GA	Matthew Ausfahl	The historical inaccuracies (angled flight decks in 1941?!), the cheese-ridden love story, silly dialogue, gross character underdevelopment, special effects that made me laugh at their transparent artificiality -- all this has been harped on at length by the film's critics. But the capper, for me, was the B-25's strafing of the Japanese soldiers mere seconds before it crashed. Boy, what disciplined soldiers those were in Josh Hartnett's flight crew -- and they even managed to kill all the Japanese! Give me a break. This film represents the worst of the worst.	1.0	Pathetically bad theatre.	2001-07-14	11	7	4

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2DKUO0MEI1EM7	Matthew G. Hartman	"I went to this film on the very first day it came out it the hopes of a grand experience.  When I entered the theater I met up with a friend of mine that had just seen it.  When I mentioned I was there to see it as well; he simply told me, ""Pearl Harbor is like have a three hour colonoscopy without any pain medication.""  To say the least he was right.  What ensued was a great 50 minute war film mixed with a sad, tired, boring, predictable, poorly acted,(did I say predictable?) love story.  I am generally a fan of Ben Affleck but this time around I would be ashamed to say I was.  Through out the whole film he looked like he was reading his lines off of a teleprompter like in a bad soap opera.  In fact the whole love story was like one.  And my god Kate Beckinsale was awful, and don't get me started on Josh Hartnett.  This film was so much like Titanic it made me sad to see it.  The ONLY good thing to come out of this movie was the war scenes that looked breathtakingly good.  But to make things worse there are going to be no less than two DVD versions coming out!  One is even a directors cut! Let's hope that that version is at least an hour shorter.  The price that most stores are attaching to it is only worth the actual bombing scene and the original teaser trailer.  In case you haven't noticed I am not a fan.  But don't listen to me if you like the movie chances are you and I wont agree.  This review is just me spouting off my disappointment for what could have been a good film."	2.0	this was a painful film...hurts the eyes, ears, and the rear.	2001-12-03	3	3	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	marks the 60th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. I wish I could report that the movie Pearl Harbor is a fitting retelling of that event, but it turns out to be pretty lame. It is also quite long. To paraphrase film critic Roger Ebert, it somehow manages to squeeze a two hour movie into three hours.Rafe and Danny [Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett] are best friends from he hills of Tennessee who sign up for a hitch in the Navy and become pilots. Rafe is the stronger of the two, and, when he gets a chance to fight with the RAF in England against the Nazis, he tricks Danny into staying behind because he doesn't want him to be injured or killed. Before he departs, he meets Evelyn [Kate Beckinsdale], a Navy nurse, and they fall deeply in love. During a dog fight off the English coast, Rafe is shot down and is presumed dead. Meanwhile, Danny and Evelyn have been transferred to the naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. They are grief stricken over Rafe, but three months later, they are in love with each other. In basic soap opera tradition, Rafe turns out to be very much alive and just shows up one day in Hawaii.It takes nearly and hour and a half for this love triangle to unfold on screen before the Japs finally show up and change everything. Then the attack itself runs forty minutes. In this sequence, which is spectacular but strangely unmoving, Rafe and Danny seem to be everywhere at once. They dodge bombs and bullets to get to their planes in order to take out a few Japanese. Next, they are in the chaos-filled hospital giving blood. Moments later, they are aboard the capsized USS Arizona trying to free sailors trapped inside. After the attack, the movie has another hour still to go. Rafe and Danny get to go on Jimmy Doolittle's famed air raid on Tokyo.The structure of this movie is awkward and puzzling. More competent film makers [or ones who weren't handed a 150 million dollar budget] could have told the story of the love triangle in half the time it takes Pearl Harbor to do so. It is, after all, a tried and true plot device. Then there is the last hour. The Tokyo raid is essentially a whole other movie. I think the idea was to tell the audience that we Americans didn't take the infamous day laying down. We fought back. But everyone knows already that. We know who won W.W.II. Any information about what happened after Pearl Harbor could have been handled with brief notes before the final credits.Movies have never been the best tool for teaching history. It gets in the way of the entertainment quotient, it clashes with modern values, and/or it's improperly research. For example, nobody smokes in the film. That may make the movie's heroes and heroines more appealing by current standards, but it's also inaccurate. In the real Pearl Harbor attack, the airfields were attacked first, but this fact gets in the way of the movie's script, so it shows the attack starting with the ships. That point is minor compared to the other revisionist history involved. I promise you that the Japan of 1941 was as evil, ambitious and out of control as Nazi Germany. The atrocities they committed in China were horrendous. But the movie portrays the Japanese leadership as being merely upset because we were cutting of their oil supply, as if bombing Pearl Harbor would solve the problem. The reason for glossing over the facts? It's simple economics. Japan is now the second biggest market for Hollywood movies after the USA. The producers were trying to make sure it didn't bomb there.	2.0	Momentous event turned into banal movie	2002-03-11	5	4	1

I went and saw it opening weekend for my birthday in 2001.I could not have been more disappointed!While the special effects were good, I'll give it that, and the attack scene was well-done, the historical accuracy was abysmal. Michael Bay might as well not even had historical advisors on this film, for he sure as hell didn't listen to them. At the scene in New York alongside the Queen Mary, it shows her being painted gray (by that time, she'd already been painted gray for awhile), in the Pearl Harbor attack scene you have Japanese Zeros flying over MODERN U.S. Navy warships docked in the harbor, and the Doolittle Raid is launched from a MODERN-DAY carrier with a number '8' painted on the deck to symbolize U.S.S. Hornet! Disgraceful! There was a group of WWII veterans sitting behind me in the theater, and they got up and walked out, and I couldn't blame them one bit. And on top of all these gross historical inaccuracies, we also have to deal with some crap-ass love triangle.Bottom line, if you want to see a movie about Pearl Harbor, get ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" and skip this piece of crap completely. If Amazon.com had a 'Zero Star' rating, I'd give it to this film.And Michael Bay, stick to directing purely fiction-based films like ""Transformers"" and ""Bad Boys"", because you have absolutely NO sense of history."	1.0	Worst World War II Movie I've Ever Seen!	2013-09-17	6	5	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3TYO5D7YVSIIE	Matthew J. Virchow	PEARL HARBOR (2001, PG-13= War Violence, Some Language, Brief Sexual Content, and Images of Wounded) The Cast: BEN AFFLECK, KATE BECKINSALE, ALEC BALDWIN, JOSH HARTNETT, CUBA GOODING JR., TOM SIZEMORE, JON VOIGHT and COLM FEORE. The Genre: War/Drama/Action/Romance The Plot: After Rafe McCawley (Affleck) is sent off to fight for the British, his first love, Evelyn, (Beckinsale) and best friend, Danny, are sent off to Pearl Harbor. After hearing news of Rafe's death, Evelyn and Danny find a love for each other. When Rafe returns, only to find that the two are together, the bomb drops on Dec. 7th, 1941. What Works: Great war sequences, very believable special effects, fun acting, great romance and emotional ties. What Doesn't: Big Hollywood names being used briefly as minor supporting roles which aren't really focused on at all. This is another one of those films that uses a historical event as a backdrop for a love affair, and romance. This film also, obviously tried to copy a lot of the momentum and success of TITANIC, of course because the producers even said it will be the next TITANIC type film, and uses a lot of the same events and same emotional aspect. Reality Check: We should all know that there was no such romance caught up in Pearl Harbor, and that there wasn't any Rafe McCawley, Danny Walker or Evelyn Stewart, and that Danny and Rafe never shot down all of those planes. However, the characters of JON VOIGHT, CUBA GOODING JR., and ALEC BALDWIN are real, as is a lot of the war events of the attack- which are true. The Catch: Much of this film is expected, being it's a lot like TITANIC, but the film is very good. For those of you who don't like watching big love affairs caught up in major historical events- you may be disappointed with this one. OVERALL: &quot;This great summer blockbuster is one to treasure, having sweeping romance, breathtaking action and an extremely emotional and impacting story line! This is the real PEARL HARBOR at its best! The Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer team is triumphant!&quot;	5.0	Very underrated. A great summer blockbuster!	2001-08-27	7	1	6
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2BAUJLJCEYBYB	"Matthew MacDonald ""mattymacd"""	This movie is a mess. The storied history of the attack on Pearl Harbor has become a $100+ million dollar effects spectacular (...) and it's quite sad.The script is just absolutely hideous. There is no emotional pull to draw you in and although the movie tries it ends up with only cheap melodrama in its place. The love story/best friends plotline is just a two bit way of trying to make you care what happens to the characters, but just comes off as laughable. You couldn't care a lick for anybody, and it's only made worse that the actors, particularly Baldwin and Affleck, deliver utterly inane dialogue with the most serious conviction that you end up smirking at it. Cuba Gooding had the most minor of roles in the movie so I'm not even sure why his character was even included. It added nothing whatsoever to the already weak plot. And there are plenty of other minor characters that leave you with just as much a sense of unfeeling. Affleck is also a weak, weak lead. This movie may try to mimic the feel of 1940s cinema, but Affleck is no Cary Grant, that's for sure. You end up hating him rather than identifying with him because he's so annoying.There are many problems here to be sure, but the one thing I did like was Jon Voight's portrayal of FDR. Sure, his dialogue was just as weak as all the rest, but at least he was kind of convincing as a president desperate not to be seen as a physically uncapable leader.You can see this movie, just don't expect much out of it. It's an embarrassment to the memory of those who lived through this horrific event. Not having this movie hadn't have been made by Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer, who are not known for their subtle touch, would have at least been a start to improving the quality of this movie.	1.0	Heard some bad things about this movie?

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AUL28QCLP74V7	Matthew Palermo	This movie is long, cliched, and boring. Since the other reviews covered everything else, I will focus on my pet peeve: the final moments of the attack sequence.Now, in the -ACTUAL- attack, two American fighters -did- manage to get off the ground...but they were outnumbered and outgunned...and lasted all of 5 minutes.Michael Bay dispenses with historical accuracy here in favor for some Top Gun-like sequences to appease the audience after subjecting them to 25 minutes of US people and property getting helplessly blown to bits. Of course, the &quot;Maverick&quot; and &quot;Ice Man&quot; of this film end up being Affleck and Hartnett's characters, as the pair make their better-trained enemies look like this was their first flight in an aircraft. The fact that the Zero was more maneuverable than the P-40 was causally overlooked here as well.I felt this movie was rather disrespectful toward those who died in the attack, merely because it seems to throw the attack on the backburner in favor of the trite love triangle.	2.0	Not worth it.	2001-12-01	5	4	1

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A19K4C9DNO04VC	Matthew Sutherland	This is one of the worst so-called blockbusters I have ever seen. It fails to hold together as a whole, and its component parts fail to convince. The Affleck/Beckinsale/Hartnett love triangle left me with no sympathy for any of the characters whatsoever. In fact the only people I felt any sympathy for were the Japanese for wanting to drop lots of high explosive on them.The action sequence, whilst impressive in terms of pure effects, was too confusing to leave any sense of emotion - I felt neither angry, nor sad, nor anything really, except wondering what the hell was going on. And the post-attack part of the film is instantly forgettable.&quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; was so much better in every way. For one thing, it brought out some real emotion as it got to grips with the key issue of the attack coming prior to the declaration of war - a fact ignored in &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;.I was genuinely bored watching this movie and I wish I hadn't bought it without seeing it first.	1.0	What a waste of time and money!	2002-02-05	12	7	5

Bad things first, about the first half-hour. This was the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life, I mena come on. Okay, we're here to see a movie about the attack on Pearl Harbour, at least that's what I got from the title, but aparently I was wrong, because for about 45 minutes, all they were doing was making stupid love references, I'll go to a chick flick for that, I want to see action, call me shallow but it's the way I am. I was sitting in my movie seat thinking to myself, &quot;Okay, good scene change maybe they'll start to....no wait, more idle chat&quot; Another bad thing was FDR, they could have found a more convincing actor to portry him. There were great things too, such as them not portraying the Japenese as total evil slimeballs, because the average soldier person was merely brainwashed by the militant government and thought they were doing a good thing. They were only trying to protect their families, granted it was a bad thing, but we could have, and probably did, do the same thing. I also enjoyed the special effects and all of Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s part, he was great. Any way, go see the movie and decide for yourself.	3.0	Mixed Emotions	2001-11-21	4	2	2

The actually Pearl Harbor scene didn't take up much of the movie's plot, just a fraction of the time... and the movie is made to seem to be dragged on.  But I guess what do I expect... this is a hollywood film.If your expecting this movie to be a war movie (like I was), then you'll be disapointed... but if you want to see a drama/romance, then you'll probably enjoy it.	2.0	Its an O.K. movie... but why is it called Pearl Harbor?	2001-12-08	1	1	0

Needless to say, I found it moderately entertaining at best.The love story, though not extremely far-fetched, was slightly unbelievable and definitely long-winded.  The majority of the movie was a very cheesy attempt at a good movie.  There is one scene where President Roosevelt stands, some found it moving, but I found it extremely cheesy.All in all, the movie was not worth the three hours of my life I wasted on it, I wish they had a place where you could just view the hour just before, through, and just after the battle.On a positive note:  I thought Cuba Gooding Jr. did a very good job with his role and I thought that the battle was convincing.  Overall I would give it 3 stars only because of the battleand Mr. Gooding.	3.0	over rated	2001-05-27	2	1	1

After watching this film, it was one of &quot;THE&quot; worst movies I had ever seen this summer. Joe Dirt was more entertaining...The only redeeming qualities this movie had were Cuba Gooding Jr. and Kate Beckinsale. Their performances made their characters believable and truly genuine. Despite Mr. Gooding's brief screen presence, his character added to the film's emotion and heart.I was expecting to see a war movie, not a teen heart-throb love triangle. The plot was oh-so predictable, and the lines surpassed coy, yet rested on the &quot;cornball/cheesy&quot; side.Overall, I felt that the storyline was unimaginative and boring. The attempt of recreating the &quot;bombing of Pearl Harbor&quot; was poor and overdrawn. It was as if this movie started out as a love triangle story with a little bit of Pearl Harbor historical events thrown in for good measure.If you are a fan of any of the actors in the film, then go.

The love story lasts the first hour of the movie. During that time there is no action.The action scene for 45 minutes is alright. Theres few people with blood on them. The bombs look alright but seem to fall under the category of mediocre. Everything looks shameful. The only tragic thing is the music, which is depressing. They didn't show the real way it happened. It was violent and brutal.The real thing that got to me was the way they tried to make everything dramatic. Cuba shoots down a plane. He cheers wildly. Theres still 137 other planes dude. Then the boys get their planes and shoot down 7 japanese planes. Are we suppose to be impressed? It took them 30 minutes just to get in the air. Pearl Harbor is a day of rememberance. I guess the battle scenes are okay. The problem is the love story.3 hour movie. 2 hours are love story. 2 hours. 2 hours. 2 hours. Say that to yourself. This is Pearl Harbor, not love connection. I don't care if two guys love the same girl, find a different movie to put that garbage in. Pearl Harbor is about the men who died in their boats, not how a guy and a girl smooched. Save your money. The worst is the ending. Instead of actually showing you what happens they flash an American flag and a dude talks. Then they proceed into another overly-dramatic segment where we see a girl narrarate the story. It wasn't moving at all. 0 stars.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3K8TYU7UOUTR0	M. Dog	"It took some doing, but director Michael Bay and company have turned this historical event, rich in story and importance, into a boring, trivial soap opera. In this film, the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor, the event that shook America off the fence into World War II, serves as a distant backdrop to a childish, stupid romance between forgettable young actors. Ben Affleck turns in another white-bread, adolescent, self-absorbed performance. Will this guy ever grow up to realize there is a big world beyond him? The female lead, Kate Beckinsale, is forgotten the moment the film is over. To say the film lacks weight is being kind. The filmmakers seem to have no understanding of what Pearl Harbor was to this country and wished instead to make a music video. Lastly, this movie serves perfectly to show the limits of computer generated special effects. Leave computer graphics to movies about hobbits and trolls. When trying to recreate history, you have to really blow things up. In Pearl Harbor (the film) all the explosions and air battles are brightly colored, but there is no sense of reality, of danger, of real things blowing up. If you want to know how this kind of film should be done, see Tora! Tora! Tora! instead. That was a serious film about a serious moment in history (plus the explosions and destruction happened in ""real time"")!"	1.0	Skip this cartoon, see Tora! Tora! Tora!	2003-05-13	17	13	4

I don't know why I've avoided this film for so long. It was probably mainly to do with the oh-so-bad reviews I kept reading, and people telling me (complete with &quot;oh man&quot; littered throughout) that it was diabolical, historically inaccurate, ya-de-ya-de-yah. I've seen the DVD many times, picked it up, and then put it back down (I've got a reputation to uphold here, y'know). And then on a bank holiday, it had its terrestrial premier on UK TV. So I thought what the hell, I'll give it a whirl, and then see what all the fuss is about, and most likely give it a bad review.Boy, was I wrong.I've seen reviews that have said it's too slow, it takes an hour before it gets into the real swing of things, blah blah blah. Well, I'm sorry, but I was hooked from the beginning. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, and was dreading the phone ringing, or the 20-minute break halfway through for the news.And in my opinion, everyone that has watched this, and given it a bad review, has a heart of stone. OK, so it has a few corny lines, but tell me a film that doesn't. The whole romance thing is cheesy and predictable (what guy is honestly going to touch his best friend's girl?) but I'm an old romantic at heart, and most of the scenes between Kate Beckinsale  &amp; Ben Affleck had me going practically giddy. (Kate Beckinsale  and Josh Hartnett just didn't seem right)Ben Affleck is so cute in this! And Kate Beckinsale  is absolutely gorgeous too, but I'm not that way inclined. And for once, it wasn't the uniform that was making me go weak at the knees, it was just Ben Affleck before J-Lo, just being himself.This is the second Michael Bay movie that I've seen that has made me cry buckets! I was welling up throughout, but by the end, the gates opened, and the tears wouldn't stop. And I thought I was bad enough at Armageddon! (&quot;Bruce Willis is gonna die! WAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot; And then someone has the nerve to tell me that &quot;it's only a film&quot;. My eye it's only a film!) I'm glad I didn't see this movie in the cinema - cos I did with Armageddon, and that was highly embarrassing.OK, I did notice some historical inaccuracies in this, not that I was looking out for them you understand, but there are some glaringly obvious stupid things. It's the 40s right? Have they never heard of contraception? It was practically a sin if you were unmarried and had a child in the 60s, you would have been burnt at the stake and sent to dance with the devil for this! And four months passes, but still no pregnancy bump? On someone as skinny as Kate Beckinsale 's character, there would definitely be a bump! And Rafe has dyslexia, but he writes pages and pages to Evelyn? Not possible, and probably not legible.There are some fairly cheesy lines - obviously Michael Bay was reading some Mills &amp; Boon before doing this movie. Some of these include: &quot;When I get cold, the one place I can go to be warm is to think of you&quot;; &quot;I'm going to give my whole heart to Danny, but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you&quot; and for some major eye rolling: &quot;I love you, and I'll have your baby, only I love him more, and you have to accept that in spite of my loving you forever while he'll always be my true love..&quot; Even I'm not that much of a romantic.This film was visually stunning. The action scenes were incredible, and absolutely breathtaking. But there were some sad moments amongst all the action scenes - the saddest being Ben Affleck &amp; Josh Hartnett's characters holding the hands of the drowning on the Arizona.However, I did feel that Michael Bay watched Armageddon &amp; Titanic a little too many times while making this film. There are many scenes very reminiscent of both movies. For example, Kate Beckinsale  could pass for Liv Tyler, especially in some of the final scenes, when she's there to meet her loved one off the plane. And the scenes actually in Pearl Harbour? Lots of people jumping ship, hitting propellor blades - remind you of anything? There's also planes flying overhead when the guys are walking towards their planes - a scene like the one in Armageddon, when they're all going to go away into space.The score is very reminiscent of Armageddon too, and was very sad and tugged at the heartstrings. Some simple scores can set me off, and along with Armageddon, Anne of Green Gables, and a couple of other scores that people keep playing me, this score will be amongst them.This is THE movie to have in your collection. It's going to quite happily join my collection of 'bad' movies as soon as I can get my hands on it. And it's up there in my list of great movies, along with Armageddon, Titanic, and probably some others too.	5.0	Michael Bay wrenches MY heartstrings once more	2004-05-04	6	2	4
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A12C80X8O12YPN	meeshmiami	Pearl Harbor is a story of two young pilots' friendship and their love for the same woman, paralleled with the attack on Pearl Harbor. As spectacular as the special effects are, this film has some character flaws. Kate Beckinsale (Evelyn) is a real beauty and is well-cast as her character from that perspective, but her acting isn't believable or moving. She doesn't make us feel her love or her sorrow. Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s character (Dorie Miller) lacks character development in the screenplay, which is a pity since he plays a real-life hero. Josh Hartnett (Danny) is the real surprise in the cast. He gave the most believable performance, and with his onscreen charisma and boyish good looks, Pearl Harbor will be this heartthrob's big break into stardom. I expected Pearl Harbor's love story to be a real tear-jerker, yet I barely shed a tear. Even though it's sad, it lacks what it takes to drain us of our emotions or make our heart skip a beat. On the other hand, this film gives us a historical look at the devasting attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the sinking of the U. S. S. Arizona and the roll-over of the U. S. S. Oklahoma and from that perspective, it will leave you breathless and break your heart.	3.0	A moving war story  but  the love story is lacking.	2001-09-29	2	2	0

Action, romance, slight comedy, adventure, awesome special effects, and great actors.  Pearl Harbor keeps you on the edge of your seat, dying to know what happens next even if you HAVE seen it before.  It makes you feel as though you really were there, fighting for the United States of America.  It is a movie that makes you want to join the army, navy, military, or air force.  You can almost feel the intense heat from the explosions, the pain from shots (yes, the medical kind), and the pressure of doing a barrel role.  And most of all, it shows you what truly did happen on December 7th, 1941.	5.0	A True Review	2001-12-29	1	0	1

The fact that it was about a defiant time in history didn't even came across to us.  But after seeing it i have to say we learned a lot both pearl harbor and WWII.  It's not like when your teachers tell you about it in class and all you want to do is sit back and fall asleep.  This movie brings you into the past to get a look at the lives of the soldiers of pearl harbor and how this event changed their lives.  True parts of it probably didn't happen, but if this movie was really as horrible as some people have reviewed it then it wouldn't have made as much money as it did.  And even some teachers that i have had commented on the historacle facts in the movie.  I would reccomend this to anyone who wants to learn about pearl harbor and everyone who doesn't.	5.0	i love this movie	2001-12-23	4	0	4
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1ZIQSG9HLF3N9	Megan	Pearl Harbor is one of the best films I have seen in a while. Micheal Bay does an excellent job of creating this wonderful masterpiece. A must see for anyone, perfect to watch with your significant other, a little bombing for the guys and a little romance for the girls. A perfect movie for teens especially since Heart throbs Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck star in it. And for all you guys there is Kate Beckinsale, which is a beautiful ray of light in this movie. The story closly follows two young men who are best friends for life, Rafe McCawley (Affleck)and Danny Walker (Hartnett) grew up on a farm together and both became pilots in the U.S. Army. Rafe suddenly finds himself in love with Eveleyn Johnson (Beckinsale) but when Rafe leaves to fight in England he leaves Evelyn missing him. Danny and Evelyn find out that Rafes plane was shot down and he was declared dead. Danny and Evelyn look to each other for comfort but find themselves falling in love, Rafe reappears and the hole thing just takes off. A great movie, But I must warn you that if your a Josh Hartnett fan (like myself bigtime) then the end will be sad but I recommend it anyway!	5.0	Romantic, thrilling, and a tear jerker	2003-01-07	4	3	1

Pearl Harbor is a very moving movie, Ask anyone. It is very informative of attacks on Pearl Harbor and is a very complicated love story. But without complications, it would have (been very bad) had it not have been acted and filmed the way it had. Though recent events have surely swayed people to buy this magnificent video, I do not think that the distributors have used September 11th attacks to promote Pearl Harbor. Still don't believe me?

I really enjoyed the movie although it wasn't what I had thought it would be.  It was a very moving story.  It really gives you the feeling of what life was like back then and the real terrors and bravery that came along with protecting the country.

The story is primarily about a love triangle that just happens to involve two pilots - but that fact is really unnecessary to the story itself.  The love story itself could have been by and between any three people who happened to be in Hawaii when the Japanese attack took place.

This movie's problems are legion. First off the plot line was apparently written by a hyperactive fourteen-year-old who was laid up for a weekend with a bad cold.  Best buddies dream of flying, grow up, join the Air Corps.  Buddy One (Affleck), in a (literally) dyslexic fit of passion meets Girl (Beckinsale).  Buddy One then proceeds to leave Girl to fight Germans with the RAF, as he would apparently rather fight than....well pardon my almost French.  Buddy Two (Hartnett) stays behind because Buddy One did not tell him it was voluntary service and he assumed he couldn't go (apparently he had to stay home and wipe wings with Jimmie Doolittle).  (...) Casting problems:  This film was primarily a posing piece for  Affleck and Hartnett, who just look too ""generation duh"" to pull off a forties fighter jock.  In a real war, both would have been shot and left in a ditch by their own men.  And Jimmie Doolittle was (...) not a pudgy, aging, lantern-jawed ex-sex-symbol (Baldwin).The script overall was riddled with hackneyed plot-twists, up to and including a plucky little doggie with a hurt paw.The raid on Japan was a direct rip-off of the 1940s classic ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo.""In essence, this was the movie ""1941"" without the laughs, as it is about as historically accurate (...).This is just a bad movie, and that's all there is to it.  With so many magnificent TRUE stories of heroism, courage, and devotion to duty generated on that Day of Infamy, I cannot understand why the writer felt the need to fabricate the story line he did, and I wonder if he actually read any actual accounts of the event before he set pen to paper."	1.0	"Can I give this a ""Negative Star"" rating?"	2001-12-03	59	34	25

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3FCDGAWXK70FC	M. Genne	"At least Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer are consistent. Their ""Pearl Harbor"" is a visually arresting monster with attractive leads, formulaic plotting, cartoonish characterizations, and jingoistic appeals to our patriotism that are about as subtle as a giant American flag flying over a Perkins Pancake House.When it was released in 2001, I had hoped that Bay-Bruckheimer would at least attempt to make this their ""Titanic"" -- a full-body workout for the special-effects guys that somehow also tells a good story. But this movie remains as flat and numbing as ever. It certainly shows every dollar of its titanic budget, but unlike James Cameron's film, ""Pearl Harbor"" does not transcend its origins. It was made to do one thing very well: haul in 13-year-olds' allowance money. (Consider the triage scene at the naval hospital, where shots of agony and gore were blurred in post-production so the movie could get its coveted PG-13.)Given the relative skill of its actors and its colossal production values, ""Pearl Harbor"" could have been a fine movie in the hands of a more imaginative director and a more courageous producer. But Bay and Bruckheimer deliver the lowest common denominator of summertime fluff. If you want the stark reality of combat, see ""Saving Private Ryan."" If you want a love triangle in the midst of war, see ""Enemy At The Gates."" And if you absolutely HAVE to see a Pearl Harbor love story, watch the only decent one ever made: ""From Here To Eternity."""	1.0	Coulda, shoulda, woulda. But didn't.	2007-04-29	10	6	4

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"Mix the following ingredients on a wide-screen:65% predictable, maudlin, melodramatic script.15% computerized special effects to appeal to male audience members.10% bad acting using the combined lackluster efforts of Ben Affleck & Josh Hartnett for teenaged girl sex appeal.5% somewhat flavorful acting from Evelyn Beckinsdale.3% poetic liscence for historical inaccurracy.1% presentation of the Japanese enemy.0.7% predictable, flavorless acting from Alec Baldwin as the Navy pilot commander to Affleck & Hartnett.0.2% aged Jon Voight playing President Roosevelt.0.1% political correctness using Cuba Gooding Jr for an African-American Navy cook.Bake for 183 minutes in front of a live audience of bored adults and swooning underaged girls.This recipe changed little from Michael Bay's preceding directorial work of ""Armageddon"", except that he increased the teenaged girl sex appeal by adding Josh Hartnett to Ben Affleck and he also lengthened the baking time by 40 minutes.Michael Bay had no intention of creating a war film with ""Pearl Harbor"".  Instead, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 was merely the backdrop for the primary plot: a ficticious love triangle between Affleck, Hartnett and Beckinsdale.  Had this film been less than 2 hours in length, it would have been far more palatable.  Few adults can eat marshmellows for three hours.If you want a film that is more substantive and historically accurate, watch ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"".

Even lesser war films such as ""Casualties of War,"" ""Full Metal Jacket"" and even ""Hamburger Hill"" are far better films than ""Pearl Harbor.""As Roger Ebert wrote, ""Pearl Harbor"" is the story of how the Japanese launched an attack on an American love triangle.I've read other customers who've posted their opinions that this film is historically accurate. Really?It was more fantasy than reality.First of all, a ""Titanic"" it's not. ""Titanic"" is not a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but it makes for good popcorn entertainment.By comparison, ""Pearl Harbor"" is flat-out awful.Furthermore, the love story is implausible. And the characters are wooden, the dialogue flat and forgettable.The film doesn't even deal with the fact that Roosevelt knew the Japanese were going to attack Pearl Harbor, but withheld that information so America would have a reason to enter World War II.The characterization of the soldiers and Roosevelt is pure romantic melodrama.The characterization of the Japanese soldiers is one-dimensional and full of stereotypical and racial caricatures and cliches.The historical arguments aside, the film is full of sugary, dumbed down reality as it borrows from a glut of action-war films such as ""Top Gun.""The ending insults anyone with intelligence, going for a rah-rah happy ending (the raid on Tokyo) rather than just ending the film soon after the Pearl Harbor attack.&lt;P(...)P>Veterans of World War II and those soldiers and citizens who experienced the attack at Pearl Harbor should be upset that these money-grubbing filmmakers used the tragedy that is Pearl Harbor as a dimly painted background for the film, ignoring those who suffered and died that day.By comparison, despite the weaknesses of ""Titanic,"" the filmmaker made sure to make the viewers feel the pain, tragedy and sense of loss emanating from the sinking of the ship.But watching ""Pearl Harbor,"" I felt none such emotion.  The film wasn't even about ""Pearl Harbor."" It was about some childhood friends who fall in love with the same nurse and their good ol' love triangle is interrupted by the Japanese military.The movie makes it seem like the Japanese military's main act was breaking up the love triangle.At least the filmmakers of ""Titanic"" were smart enough to avoid such a display.""Pearl Harbor"" is going to sell tons of DVDS and videotapes because it's dumbed down, watered down fluff. And fluff sells.If you want to see good World War II films, there are many to choose from. Start with ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" which is very historically accurate, showing both the American and Japanese perspectives on the war.(and my last point, remember, that there was a large community of Americans of Japanese descent living in Hawaii at the time who were just as affected by the attack at Pearl Harbor as any other American. And ""Pearl Harbor"" doesn't even acknowledge the fact that there was a large Asian community in Hawaii. the film portrays the Japanese-Americans as participants in the attack on Pearl Harbor)."	1.0	One of the worst films ever made/historically inaccurate	2001-12-03	5	2	3

The story revolves around Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett who are best friends and both fall in love with Kate Beckensdale.  Many people (myself included) thought that this would be a rip-off of the Leo DeCaprio/Kate Winslet story of Titanic.  It is nothing of the sort.  Though Affleck and Harnett are love rivals, they remain true friends throughout.The story is loaded with several little subplots that happen during the attack and Beckensdale's character has some awesome scenes as a nurse trying to deal with all the wounded and being a calming influence on many fatally injured.The story does not end with the attack but continues with a daring mission undertaken by Harnett and Affleck with an extraordinary performance by Alec Baldwin as their leader and trainer.  The actor that portrays FDR is also excellent and has some great moments of his own.  Each of these actors could easily have won an Oscar for their performance.

An event as important as the attack on Pearl Harbor is done an injustice when its inherent gravity and drama is stuck in the backseat in favor of a trite, cliched love triangle saturated with gloss and bloated self-importance.&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; works for the 30 minute sequence in the film's  middle when the Japanese attack, but is mind-numbingly bad for its other 150 minutes, when all attention is placed on the shoulders of the picture perfect, overly beautiful triangle of Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale.  It is all predictable and shallow, and filled with dialogue that is as original and intelligent as a loaf of Wonder Bread.&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; fails as history, falls flat as romance and drama, and lacks even a drop of intelligence or creativity.  It is well photographed, and technically competent, especially in the attack sequence; but on the whole, it is a monstrous, over-inflated failure.	2.0	Bad &amp; beautiful	2002-01-02	22	16	6
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3QZCA4LTTVGAD	Michael J. Mazza	I have to admit, I went to see the film &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; directed by Michael Bay, partially out of a sense of obligation--after all, the film deals with an important era in history. While I enjoyed PH, the film's many flaws do detract from it overall. This film takes place during World War II, and includes a love story involving two Army pilots and a military nurse. As the title indicates, a major part of the film involves the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.PH seems to want to be a cross between &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (they of the big box office and multiple Oscar nominations). There's even a throw-away scene involving a big ocean cruise ship to further the &quot;Titanic-wannabe&quot; vibe.Unlike &quot;Titanic,&quot; however, the love story and historic destruction elements in PH never seem to convincingly mesh. The film struck me as oddly disjointed. And whereas the scenes of death and violence in &quot;Private Ryan&quot; struck me as solemn and respectful to veterans, I was made uneasy by the corresponding scenes in PH. The attack on Pearl Harbor goes on endlessly, and is filmed with an exploitative, &quot;ain't these explosions cool&quot; feel. It reminded me of the film &quot;Armageddon&quot;--an excuse to show off the latest special effects and sound technology, rather than an attempt to use this technology to dig at deeper truths.This film includes portrayals of a number of real historical figures, such as U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. And herein lies another problem. One of the film's minor characters is Navy Petty Officer Dorie Miller, an African-American who performed a great act of heroism during the attack on Pearl Harbor. I found it insulting that this man, who really deserves a movie all to himself, is squeezed into this film as a minor element that could be cut out without affecting the main love story plot. The film barely acknowledges the institutional racism that Miller and others had to deal with. Instead, the script treats him as the sort of black character who is meant to make naive white viewers feel better about America.The scenes involving the Japanese are shot with a stiff formality that makes the Japanese seem cold and alien.Of course, there are some good points to PH. The performances are very good. Josh Hartnett deserves to become a major star. The production design is excellent. And maybe the film will inspire some viewers to explore the real history of this era.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2L6ZODVICXS0V	Michael J Nathan	... I rented this copy and as soon as the Director's Cut Edition comes out I will be hurrying out to purchase it for my own collection. This isn't just a good movie, it's a great movie and I only hope that those who were involved in the making of it weren't deeply pained by the foolishness of the Hollywood critics who had so many rotten things to say about it. Michael Bay and all who were involved did an incredibly tremendous job of putting the viewer right into the battle and into the minds of those who were involved on December 7, 1941. I also loved the story that surrounded the Pearl Harbor sequence. ...These are real people placed in a very real and emotional situation and the actors did a tremendous job of portraying the many, many dimensions of each character. I was especially impressed with Jon Voight's portrayal of FDR. THE CRITICS ARE WRONG! This is a tremendous bit of film making.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A30CULRZ756V0G	Michael Kramer	Pearl Harbor turned out to be the movie I was expecting.  Almost no historical accuracy (then again, if you want accuracy--go read a book on it), and a schlocky love triangle/subplot which went horribly bad.  One of the saving factors of this film was the outstanding performance of Jon Voight as President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  I have seen Mr. Voight in a number of films but, this has to be his most defining role to date, he was utterly convincing in this role!  The bombing of Pearl Harbor sequence was excellent, even though you could thoroughly tell it was about 95% computer generated.  I would have to give the sound fx a thorough 5 stars, however.  The explosions, planes flying all around, and the bullets zipping and zapping everywhere rivaled Private Ryan.  Alec Baldwin was his usual stoic self in the role of CDR. Doolittle.  However, he also gave a lot of realism to the part, and brought a real war hero back to life.  The major stars are what ruined it for me.  It was a &quot;let's see how cute our lead actors can be&quot;, rather than a Speilberg film that is a &quot;lets get great actors who look the part, rather than flashy cardboard cutouts&quot;.  Afleck sure as heck wasnt convincing with that so-called accent (by the way, what kind of accent was he trying to attain anyway?).  All-in-all, it was an ok film with really good fx.  Like I said earlier the sound is excellent (especially in Sony Dynamic Digital Sound, which the theater I saw it in had).  But other than that, it falls flat and is really predictable.	3.0	A Bomb?

The attack footage is spectacular, the rest of the movie is such a waste.  When you have a list of people like this movie does that you just know can act (Affleck, Baldwin, Sizemore, and Gooding) and this is what you get out of it, I think it says something.  This movie says Michael Bey should stick to the movies where things blow up and he tells a buddy story and leave the romantic pieces to others.I may be selling this short as I did use the skip ahead a number of times to try to get past the plastic romance, but the fact that I used it at all is telling.  If you want to see a good movie about Pearl Harbor, get the reissue of Tora! Tora! Tora!

Schneider	"Talk about your disappointments!For almost two years, I have eagerly anticipated this film.  The stills that would leak out would captivate my imagination toward the belief that, finally, there would be a film that would do justice to the ""Day of Infamy.""Instead, I got to see three hours of a biring Titanic rip-off love triangle in which I cared about none of the characters that just happened to take place around the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.The plot is dull and boring.  There is no attachment to the characters at all.  The dialog is rediculous, and the writer(s) obviously didn't research their history well.  ""It looks like Woprld War Two just started!""  Well, at that point, there was no World War ONE.  It was still considered ""The Great War!""  Oh, and should a Lieutenant in the U.S. Army decide to go fight for the British before the United States entered the war, he would have had to resign his comission in the Army.  The Armed Services are NOT professional sporting teams, there is no free agency!  And these are just two of the many absurdities I can point out!I know it seems petty to be picking on these small details while reviewing this film, but the fact lies here:  Were the movie even halfway decent, I would have been able to suspend my disbelief to some degree and overlook all this.  As it was, during those seemingly endless three hours, I had to keep myself occupied somehow.The only reason I gave this film two stars is because of the battle scene.  It truly is breathtaking, and worth viewing.  Michael Bay has truly outdone even himself in choreographing this battle.  It kept me on the edge of my scene, and was awe inspiring to watch.  It's too bad the other 2 hours and 30 minutes ""were so bad"".Follow my advice:  Show up an hour late for the film, then leave after the battle.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3L46ZRKNFN0SG	Michael W. Howe	i can't believe I wrote that for a title, but before this, I thought Mummy 2 was a disappointment.  I was far from wrong.  What we have here is basically Jerry Bruckheimer and his puppet-like-explosives-loving wooden boy Michael Bay, adding a totally fictitious love story to try to convince us that Bay wants to be taken seriously as a director.  Well, after this, I have even less faith in these two.  Basically, they are destroying the mindset of cinema, with every movie they make that grosses $150 million.  Pearl Harbor's love story between Ben Affleck's character and Kate Beckinsale's character is very badly choreographed.  They meet for what is to us 15-20 minutes of screentime, and a quick flirt and a champagne cork to the nose are meant to be signs that they are in love in no time?  DiCaprio and Winslet convinced me better.  Even Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; were convincing!  Now, to save more knashing time, here is my list of problems with the film:1.Bay's use of Beckinsale, sitting on the rocks along Hawaii, as waves crash around her, staring dreamily off into the horizon thinking of Affleck.  How corny is that?!2.We are meant to care about the many soldiers, but the fact is, we know very few, if any of the people who get thrown into the air, fall off boats, or otherwise.3.There are only so many times when a torpedo hitting the water can look cool.  By the 6th time, we are bored out of our minds.4.Why does every lead have to be a macho American He-Man?  Bay and Bruckheimer are so over the top with American spirit, as much as Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich (ID4, The Patriot).5.Humor in a war?  If I was in war, humor would be the last thing on my mind.6.Camera angles.  Several times, we are subjected to things that we don't know what is going on.7.Your best friend gets it on with your girlfriend, and after about 5 hours of being angry at him you forgive him?8.Stuff flying at the camera.  now, anything that comes straight at us we are going to know it's an effect.  It's LAME!!9.No interaction with any real historic figures.  Aside from a meeting with a man named Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) and a cook played by Cuba Gooding Jr, there are no real connections such as Titanic's captain or it's ships' builder.10. Ok, the Japanese are shown speaking in English subtitles, but when we hear the thoughts of a pilot, his thoughts speak to us in ENGLISH? Also, we only hear this one pilot once, and then he just becomes one of the many in planes that have no name.11. A ride in a plane at sunset and then a private momentin a parachute room.  Wow, if that's what passed as romantic back then,  I still prefer the 1950's.12. The cuts: we go from huge war to quiet moments.  This sudden stopping does nothing to really help move the story along.  13.Soundtrack-the music has some good uses of touch that Hans Zimmer put to good use in &quot;Gladiator,&quot; but WHERE IS IT ON THE SOUNDTRACK?  My high school band director actually returned his copy of the soundtrack!14. A war in the middle of a movie does not make it a great film!  Unless the film is enjoyable overall, the film is basically garbage!And now, the good parts.  1.Visual Effects- Sadly, the effects are the only thing to talk about.  This film ranks up with Hollow Man and Twister: good FX, no plot.  The one star is for the effects also, as Industrial Light and Magic does good work.Well, that's about all I can say here.  If you want to see more bad movies like Bruckheimer's and Bay's, see Armageddon (I reviewed that as well).  however, don't look to this film as the next classic.  See &quot;Lawrence of Arabia,&quot; &quot;Crouching Tiger,&quot; or &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot;  Better yet, if someone wants to go see this movie, tell them to see &quot;Shrek&quot; or &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; or &quot;Memento&quot; instead.	1.0	The Mummy Returns was better than this!	2001-06-07	9	7	2

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	"December 7th, 1941 ... It was, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt so bluntly put it, a day that would live in infamy. The attack on Pearl Harbor over sixty years ago was less of an attack on the American people themselves as it was an attack on our military defense, an area we once thought was invincible and something our enemies would never attempt to provoke. But on that fateful morning, the unthinkable happened and from then on things changed but as time went on Americans returned to the isolationistic attitude that had gotten us in trouble in the first place ... It has been said, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. That happened on September 11th, 2001, where 3,000 American lives were lost. But the American people are not an intimidatable bunch and we rose to the challenge, just like we did after the event at Pearl Harbor, to root out evil and wreak havoc on those who dared to try and terrorize us. No better moral support could be spoken better then what was said by President Bush, who stated, ""We have known freedom's price. We have shown freedom's power. And in this great conflict, my fellow Americans, we will see freedom's victory"".The story centers around a love triangle between two men who fall in love with the same nurse and their struggle to win her heart, all set against the tragic attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Rafe McCawley is a hot-shot flying ace in the United States Arms Air Corp. but it wasn't easy, as it required a young U.S. Navy nurse named Evelyn Stewart to pass him despite the fact that reading ability was slightly below average. From that moment on they fall deeply in love with each other but the time they spend together is short-lived as Rafe has been accepted to a program that sends American air pilots over to Britain to help fight off the German Blitzkrieg, one that he applied to himself. While he is overseas fighting in the war, Rafe asks his best friend Danny Walker to watch after Evelyn but when word came about that Rafe's plane came down over the ocean - basically declaring him dead - things change quickly between Danny and Evelyn from friendship to a full-fledge infatuation. Then suddenly Rafe returns alive and just as a full confrontation between the two friend is about to erupt - catastrophe hits as the Japanese sneak attack Pearl Harbor and throw the United States head first into World War II. The story for Pearl Harbor, as hard as it attempted to stick with historical accuracies, lacks severely and doesn't feel as though the filmmakers were taking this seriously, even by Jerry Bruckheimer standards. Praise must be given to Bay and Bruckheimer for attempting to create a patriotically charged feature but next time they should view The Patriot and see how it is done correctly.Once again Bruckheimer chooses a great group of talented veteran actors and fresh newcomers to head this project but despite several promising, and even surprising, performances, the script is too bland and dull for any one person to really step above the rest. Ben Affleck's performances have often been described as flat and though that can be disputed, that statement would be true for his role in this film. If there is one thing Affleck needs to improve on from this role is how to cry ... He just sounds absolutely ridiculous when he does cry and any emotional quality that was to be retained in those scenes is slightly lost. Despite a fairly handicapped performance, Affleck does manage to work well with newcomers Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale, who both give decent performances with the weak material they are given. Though the script does tend to hinder many of the main performers in this feature, several actors do manage to transcend beyond that to give excellent performances. Cuba Gooding Jr.'s role as Dorie Miller is one of those performance and is based on an actual historical figure that fought bravely against the Japanese Kamikazes at Pearl Harbor. It would have been nice to note that his character went on to fight in World War II after the event and died in combat aboard a submarine but that could be taken as a bit of downer at this film, which was obviously something the filmmakers didn't want. And the biggest surprise out of all the performances was the one given by Dan Aykroyd, who is best known for his comedic performances and often stays away from dramatic performances. But despite the lack of experience in this genre, Aykroyd gives a convincing performance that works well early on but for some reason the character ends up just dropping off around the mid-way point, which wasn't too big of a problem, just a slight issue.Overall, Pearl Harbor gives the Walt Disney Company their Titanic but the film ends up more like the ship rather then the movie in that its enormous extravagance results in its demise. Despite not receiving the same box office success its inspiration received, Pearl Harbor finds similarity to Titanic in that both features suffer from numerous clich&eacute;s, a flat and unintentionally humorous script, and a time length that feels excruciating as the feature begins to wrap-up at the end. If one were to find even a few compliments for this film it would definitely to be its absolutely astonishing battle sequences that are presented in such vivid detail that it is almost heart-wrenching, though the filmmakers didn't go to quite the level that Steven Spielberg did with Saving Private Ryan. Another worthy aspect of the film was its musical score, which was created by brilliant composer Hans Zimmer who also wrote scores for The Lion King and The Last Samurai. But the breathe-taking visuals and the brilliant musical score aren't enough to save this feature from being nothing more then a poor attempt to cash in on the success of Titanic, as well as the American military men and women who died at Pearl Harbor.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AQ1IJ2WXVY5T0	Mike Bolhuis	My expectations were low for this movie. I figured it would be as cheesy and as &quot;Hollywood&quot; as Titanic, and boy was I right. The love triangle was so schlocky, and so poorly executed it almost ruined the movie completely. I knew exactly how the film would play out after the first twenty minutes, I knew who would live and who would die, and who would end up with the girl in the end. I was very dissapointed in Randall Wallace's script, I found the characters to be bland and two-dimensional,the actors don't even have a whole lot of chemistry between them, all of the interaction between them looks awkward. After three hours, one would think you could create a little development in the characters or generate some chemisty between the actors. Wallace has written much better i.e. Braveheart, I have a feeling higher ups at the studio had him tweak the script to make the movie more marketable to teenagers. Michael Bay's directing is excellent for the action sequences, which were spectacular. The action was powerful, and exciting, and like Saving Private Ryan puts us right into the middle of the firefight. However he cannot for the life of him, generate any emotion during the rest of the movie. The dialogue and interaction between characters is lifeless and boring. Not even Cuba Gooding Jr.,(who is a terrific actor) was that exciting, although he was the most intersting character in the movie, which doesn't say much for anyone else. Unfortunatly Cuba was underused,clocking in at about fifteen minutes of screen time. His story, based on a real person, was much more dynamic than the cheesy Affleck, Hartnett, Beckinsale love triangle. This movie is not a complete waste of time, I enjoyed Cuba Gooding Jr. as he was gunning down Japanese fighters, and the spectacle of the battle sequences, but everything else is pretty forgettable, which is too bad considering the source material.	2.0	Actually two and a half stars	2001-05-25	22	16	6

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AURZ4YQ270W3T	Mike Freed	There's a great debate among film fans these days as to the proper use and place for special effects in films. Too often, it seems that Hollywood films are built around special effects and action sequences, with scenes featuring actors and plot development as filler.No modern filmmaker is more guilty of that than the director of &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; Michael Bay. In all of his previous films (including the excerable &quot;Armageddon&quot;), special effects and action are the point, with human beings tossed in to provide plot references and excuses for sappy Aerosmith ballads.&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is no different. Sure, it takes great pains to be historically accurate, and it even makes an attempt (though a lame one) to create a plot based on human relationships that (gasp) isn't punctuated every ten minutes by something exploding.And that might have worked, had the story not been a banal, poorly written romance between three leads who looked as if they were in it for a paycheck. By the time the attack actually happens, it's as if Bay realized he'd put the audience to sleep and needed a big BANG! to wake them up.In any case, the storyline leading up to the titular attack does little but set up the big-time special effects bonanza we know is coming (and soon, we hope, as Ben Affleck flubs yet another line).Compare that to the far more effective approach of &quot;Titanic,&quot; in which the big-time special effects bonanza (the ship's sinking) actually does nothing but tie up the various plots, relationships, and stories that have been told in the first part of the film. The point of the story is to explore the relationships of the people we meet on Titanic, and the sinking is a part of their story.However, in &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; the point of the story is to get to the big battle sequences, and the stories of people we meet along the way are meant to kill time until we can get until December 7, 1941. Oh, the time is killed stylishly, and the people we watch are shiny and attractive, but not for one moment do we get the sense that they're anything but filler.And that is why this film fails.	2.0	Schizoprenic, ineffective film...	2001-11-05	86	54	32

This film ranks with the very worst of world cinema. It also reflects the typical American opinion that the attack on Pearl Harbor was the most monumental event in the Second World war. The loss of life in Pearl Harbor was tiny fraction of that which occurred on the other side of the Atlantic prior to American involvement in the war. What is really pitiful is that this film will make millions all over the world. This motion picture serves as nothing more than a symbol of the abysmal state of big-budget America cinema at present. Instead of seeing this film, save time and effort by buying a flag with the Stars and Stripes on it and forcing it slowly down your throat - you will achieve a similar effect to watching the film and will also find out how the actors felt trying to cope with their appalling script.	1.0	Tragic	2001-06-07	14	11	3

I must say that it was a great movie. The creditenials of the historical events are accurate.There are two scenes in Pearl Harbor that are my favorite. The scene were Rafe and Danny fly the airplanes and shoot the Japenese down! The save the day! That was so cool. The other scene is very sad. Rafe and Danny are looking around, and the men are stuck inside of the ship. Danny or Rafe touches one of the men's hand, and anyone couldn't do anything about getting them out of the ship.I cannot wait to purchase Pearl Harbor.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AIZ0YNUYUKYLW	MJV &amp; the Movies	&quot;Thumbs Up!&quot;First off, this film isn't TITANIC.  It might be similar, but it isn't.  I believe that using a historical event as a backdrop for romance is completely being disrespectful to the war itself.  Sure, it is possible for a big love triangle to be caught up in PEARL HARBOR, but then you should make the war seem very realistic, make real characters and interesting plot to go with it.  PEARL HARBOR does that for you.  Now, just because this film is directed by Michael Bay, who's big summer blockbusters have flopped with the audience and critics, I knew it wasn't going to be a film that everyone was going to adore.  I like the Bay/Bruckheimer team films- but the audience is usually displeased.  This film, from my viewpoint is good.  Cuba Gooding Jr is excellent!  Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett make good pals.  Think Tom Cruise and Anthony Edwards, and you know what I'm talking about.  This film may not be a classic, but it sure cuts as one of the best films yet this summer.  It's no Academy Award Winner, for the possible exception of Best Visual Effects and Cinematography, but sure frosts the cake up.  PEARL HARBOR is the possibly the biggest underated film of the summer.	4.0	What I expected.  Great, but not excellent.	2001-08-18	3	2	1

The aerial combat in this film is the best that has been done so far.  ILM's special effects are perfect.  It's like Star Wars but real!  My only complaint is that the movie didn't concentration even more on the actual Pearl Harbor attack.  If I want more I'll have to see it again and I intend to.

Forget the bad press. Critics tend to &quot;tear up&quot; highly anticipated movies. It makes them &quot;good&quot; and gives them more credibility.They can say what they want, as far as I'm concerned, Pearl Harbor is a masterpiece and I'm going to tell you exactly why. The minute I knew that star producer Jerry Bruckheimer and red hot director Michael Bay were teaming up for this movie, I instantly had high expectations: I expected some beautifull shots and I had them. The opening shots are nothing short of poetry! Micheal Bay has a magic way of filming a sunset. I expected a great romance ( Michael's first!) and I had two and both were unique because they were believable. I expected the director to keep the story moving nicely and I had that too. In fact, the attack takes place an hour and a half into the movie and I almost didn't want it to happen &quot;so soon&quot; because the romance was going just fine! Last but not least, I expected the best action ever put on film and, guess what...I had that and then some! Micheal Bay is the best damn action director out there! His style is unique and, with every new movie he takes it to a new level! For all these reasons, I highly recommand this movie to every one who still believe that magic happens when a movie hits all the right notes.	5.0	Jerry Bruckheimer + Micheal Bay = Don't miss it !!!	2001-08-17	4	0	4

I didn't think that any thing could be better than Titanic, but Pearl Harbor beats it hands down!!  Ben Affleck's performance as the can't wait to be a hero Rafe Macawley shows that he is more than just eye candy.  He really gives a heart melting performance that will ensure his status as a leading man for years to come.  Josh Hartnett in his first blockbuster role shows that he has what it takes to go head to head with Leonardo DiCaprio.  His portrayl of the innocent, shy pilot Danny Walker will leave you weak in the knees.  Ben better watch his Back.  Kate Beckingsale shines as the object of the men's desires Evelyn Johnson.  Watching her performance makes you realize just why she is the object of the men's affections.  The special effects are OUT OF THIS WORLD!!  This is the closest anyone who wasn't there can get to being in the attack.  There was no way to tell exactly what was real and what was digitally created.  The love story is an essential part to the movie.  It shows us what life was like for those men and women in the service leading up to the attack, and it gives us people to care about.  If we didn't know them, why would we care if they were bombed?  I think everyone should see this so that they may get a sense of why our country is as great as it is today, and to understand the sacrifices so many men and women made not so far in the distant past.  I am a person who loves history, and often watch the history channel, and this movie still taught me things that I didn't know.

Although there were some excellent points, the overall movie failed to live up to that potential.The plot follows to aeroplane-obsessed friends, Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker. Rafe falls in love with a girl Evelyn Johnson, but soon joins the Air Force, where he goes missing. Walker and Johnson end up in Pearl Harbour, start falling in love and then things get more complicated by not only the Japanese military, but also Rafe.The story rather descends into the mediocre with its amateurish mingling of romance with war. Rather than do one or the other well, it does both appallingly. Unlike other movies that mix genres well, (such as the horror/romantic comedy inShaun of the Dead), ""Pearl Harbour"" fails to inspire.The action scenes were fairly well executed, the CGI being of an excellent quality that enhanced the movie. Cuba Gooding Jnr was also another highlight in his role as Petty Officer Doris Miller. He really was a rare high point in this movie.For war movie lovers, avoid this one. For romance movie buffs, avoid this one. It was a tragic movie, and not in the good sense."	2.0	Why Bother?	2007-05-10	5	2	3

I wanted to see how one of the most tragic days in American history would be translated to film. I was sure I would be satisfied with it... but I wasn't. Pearl Harbor is big-budget garbage. It takes a depressing day in history and turns it into a ... love story with pretty special effects. The attack on Pearl Harbor was entertaining, but not nearly enough to save this movie. Even the historical backround in the movie is off at times. Pearl Harbor should have been made similiar to Saving Private Ryan: cold, dark, and bloody. An R-rating would have helped, but Disney must have been too set on making Pearl Harbor a family film. Don't waste your time with Pearl Harbor, watch Tora! Tora!

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW	Mr. Cairene	"Fight the enemy, sink the ship, bomb the harbor; it's tragedy as spectacle. And I have no problem with it. The key to these exploitation films is to find a context in which the carnage can play a part, a carefully manipulated story centering in and around the ""action"". Basically, what the makers of these films are looking for is an excuse. Those behind this particular event picture however came up with a very bad one. Pearl Harbor, for most of its running time, is the type of z-grade soap opera that would make Kleenex's best customer wince in disgust. When the expensive bombs do finally start falling, in a frenzy of confused morality and directorial desperation, we get ""cool"" sequences with camera placed over a torpedo, ""impressive"" ones with a warship being turned over with all its crew still on board, and some really loud drums accompanying the imposing sight of over three hundred Japanese planes heading for the serene island. Simultaneously, we also get heavy-duty scenes of civilians dying beneath Han Zimmer's (I'll get to him later) sorrowful score. If that unintended dichotomy weren't enough, there's also that irritating beefcake hero running around with his buddies yelling, ""Damn, I gotta get me a plane."" Whether this is dross with ambition, or a particularly bad serious film, you'll have to decide. Pearl Harbor is terrible. And the bombs don't save it.No one expected depth, character development, acting or subtlety here. An adequate, competent non-plot/plot would have sufficed. But evidently, the director, Michael Bay had Spielbergian eminence on his mind; The film opens with two farm boys (not the farm sort, the post-card version) admiring an antique plane, after which the title ""Pearl Harbor"" appears against Spielberg's trademark image, the round setting sun. Having such lofty aspirations only serves to accentuate Bay's severe shortcomings. Its obvious that he's not half the manipulator Spielberg is, but more noteworthy is his absolute inability to complete a cinematic sentence. I would've thought that the confidence to choose a particular shot was a prerequisite for the most primitive of film courses. Yet here is Bay, the director of a hundred-and-fifty million dollar epic, and he can't decide whether to shoot his actors from the top, in profile, or from below. So he aimlessly fidgets between a hundred different approaches, fulfilling none. The fatuousness can be traced to the screenplay, by Randall Wallace, the writer of Braveheart no less, an insipid mixture of random political happenings, self-aggrandizing speeches, and dialogue so drippy, sticky and wet it clings to the screen after its shameless utterance. I would repeat that howler about the sun and moon, but my keyboard would get nauseous.Films like Pearl Harbor have the critics out for blood well before their release. At its banking system busting budget, the experienced critic knows that it can't afford to offer anything other than spectacle. It has to appeal to every member of the audience, everywhere in the world, at this particular moment in time. You should not however mistake the tepid critical response for prejudice. This is not a knee-jerk reaction to populist entertainment, Pearl Harbor is particularly awful populist entertainment. Take for example James Cameron's Titanic. That was also a huge populist, and yes, simplistic film about a tragedy. But Cameron is a director capable of rhythm, structure and discipline. Despite what his detractors may say, Cameron used all his expensive toys to get somewhere. In contrast, Pearl Harbor is a big loud mess. Bay's PG-13 war is too bloodless to horrify, his flag waving politics are too stupid to be absorb, and his love story, performed by actors who seem to have had all humanity liposucked out of them, is banal beyond words. There isn't a single quite moment in its mindless three hours.For the noise, Hans Zimmer was employed, previously of Bay's The Rock (1996). The gifted Zimmer has fashioned some great film music in the past. His score for The Rock (a good, silly action film where Bay's mania was appropriate) was superb gung-ho nonsense. Here, unsure whether the film is a serious drama, or a shoot'em up, he has come up with the standard military stuff for the stars, ominous drums for the Japanese, and most distastefully, he apes his own brilliant work on The Thin Red Line for the drama. His score plays like the film; gutless and all over the place.Some may still find the concept of death as spectacle offensive. I don't. In fact, I find little in movies that is potent enough to be offensive. A film like Saving Private Ryan, an action film that pretended to be something more, is one of the few ones that gets on my nerves. Pearl Harbor is too loud and too obvious to make any potent political or sociological suggestions that could slight anyone (even the Japanese). No, Pearl Harbor is not at all offensive. Just offensively bad."	1.0	Green Blood Donations	2001-06-01	6	2	4

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AB5DVSNPX1JSK	"Mr. Fisher ""grand_clown"""	"Pearl Harbor is a film that got a lot of hype at first and then got tons of criticism in the end.  Despite what I heard and read about Pearl Harbor being a big flop and disappointment I saw it and found the majority of the criticism to be founded.  It's not so much I think the film is a disgrace to the men and women who were at Pearl Harbor over sixty years ago or that it's an embarrassment to our veterans.  I just think it was a disappointing story in a fascinating yet tragic time in American history.Everyone knows the plot by now: two boys grow up together and fall in love later on with the same gal.  The stereotypical love triangle: love vs. friendship.  So the love story is nothing new, nothing great, been done before hundreds of different times.  The director knew this and thought he could pull a fast one by taking this over used script and just incorporate it in tragic period.  This was the mistake of the film.  The movie isn't about Pearl Harbor, December 7th, or the start of WWII.  It's about a love story that includes famous events such as the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle raids.The film is titled Pearl Harbor so I think most people that went to see it thought that's what it was going to be about because that's what it's titled.  After the movie, we all feel confused over what the movie is about because Pearl Harbor is just the backdrop and the real story is about something we know all too well about: the love triangle.  This is highly disappointing.  If we want to see this kind of romance we'll go see a romance film that we know is going to be about romance.  Pearl Harbor shouldn't be about two fly boys sharing the love of a nurse.  I anticipated it to be about something similar to Tora Tora Tora only to have more centralized characters.Now, even though the plot doesn't match the title and the romance is way too predictable and stereotypical to begin with, what ruins this movie is how much the movie is dedicated to the romance.  The film is over three hours long.  Close to two hours of it is donated to the romance story.  Not to mention the romance seems to cut in and out of serious events.  One minute Roosevelt is talking to his cabinet, the next Hartnett and Beckinsale are swimming together.  One minute Affleck is writing to Beckinsale about how much he loves her the next scene shows the Japanese going over how to attack Pearl Harbor.  What's happening is two different stories that are trying to be woven together at the same time and it doesn't quite work because one is interesting while the other is boring.  And the one that is boring gets the majority of screen time.The acting in the film is something else to be desired.  I'm just totally disappointed to how the Japanese high command is painted.  They act as if they're reading lines rather than portraying real life Japanese admirals.  Such as Yamamoto's line: ""I fear all we have done is awoken a sleeping giant..etc.""  He says it so quick and without meaning, it had little effect to the viewers, when the quote itself means quite a bit.I'm disappointed because from a story viewpoint this isn't original.  Not even close.  It's highly predictable and disinteresting.  The special effects are great, the action sequences are well done, but none of that matters if it has a weak storyline.  We wanted to see a movie about Pearl Harbor the events that led up to the attack, the attack itself, and its aftermath.  We didn't want to see this stupid love triangle that dominated the movie while the day of infamy is nothing more but a stage for it.I think this story would've been a box office success and smash hit among viewers abroad if it wasn't titled ""Pearl Harbor.""  It deserves a different title because its story does not correlate with the events.  It's really too bad because the film had plenty of potential but it was mis-used in the form of cheezy romance that we can find in any other movie.  Pearl Harbor gave the impression that it was supposed to be a special film not a high budget movie with an ordinary plot.  But that's what Pearl Harbor is: just plain ordinary.Grade: C-"	2.0	Falls short of expectations	2004-03-14	5	4	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1ER6IYOMM8VCT	"! MR. KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK"""	I think the negative reviews of this movie are a little harsh. This movie deserves 3 1/4 stars, but because of all the negative reviews I gave it a 4 star rating as the DVD release is quite nice. I do not think this is a great movie, but it is not all that bad either. It depends on how you look at it. The story starts out like a cheap five & dime romance novel, but this is done to give us some characters to care about. Well.....we end up caring, but not about the character's as much as what those sneaky M.F.er's did to us! These kind of movies really make Americans mad!! By the time the attack on Pearl Harbor was over I was ready to go bomb those M.F.er's myself! :-D! I assume that is why the film shows the American's first strike back at the Japanese? To give the audience some sort of redemption in this picture. It wasn't enough for me and I would have liked to have seen them dropping the big ones on those sneaky S O B's!It's no masterpiece, but it is a pretty good popcorn flick movie once it gets going. Excellent special effects propel this love story in wartime. After watching the movie I watched a documentary on the attack(included on the DVD) and I was impressed how accurate the war scenes in the movie were done. The 2 disc 60th ann. set is very good with an excellent transfer and many extras. Try to keep and open mind and remember, it's not a documentary, it's a movie!	4.0	HOW MUCH YOU LIKE THIS MOVIE DEPENDS ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT!	2007-09-16	2	1	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AOF70YAZ188H	"Mr. Mark A. Allan ""Buddha"""	This movie should come with a bonus pillow, because you are going to need one before the end. Seriously, this has to be one of the worst movies ever made. It is over long and drawn out to the point where most people in the cinema where I made the mistake of initially seeing it were struggling to stay awake by the time the actual attack began. Admittedly the scenes which feature the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor are impressive from a CGI point of view but tend to look more like an intro sequence to a video game than anything resembling reality. One low flying sequence in particular has the P40 fighters behaving like flying saucers in some cheap 50's Sci-Fi movie. While I realize that some artistic license is required in the making of this type of movie and that some historical inaccuracies or omissions will occur, this is almost comic book stuff. It is a convenient fact that only two American fighter aircraft managed to get off the ground and engage the Japanese on that day but to suggest that these were two childhood buddies and that they both then somehow managed to fly in Doolittle's raid on Japan is insulting to those who actually did. But in the end this sums up this movie, it is a formula American buddy movie that contains all the attributes that makes these types of movie so dire and cringe worthy. Why they named it Pearl Harbor is beyond me when that event only took up such a small portion of the movie. To call it that would suggest an attempt to document the actual events surrounding this historically important event but this is lame romantic claptrap that just uses it as a backdrop. If you want to see a movie about the subject then try Tora, Tora, Tora. There are some fine performances in this film, which must have been hard given the dire nature of the script. Cuba Gooding Jr. is excellent in his role as real life hero Dorrie Miller but Ben Affleck gives his usual impression of a block of wood in a gorilla mask. I would not waste my money on this DVD no matter how cheap it gets and I'd advise anyone reading this not to waste nearly three hours of their life watching it.

I think it's worth spending the money to see it on the big screen, comparing to so many trashy pictures out there targeting teenagers. Good love story based on history. Of course it's predictable, but you know it before you buy the ticket. And the effects are outstanding. Most movies that the critics praise usually put me to sleep. Who cares about what they say, you pay for entertainment and that's what you get. I sense a lot of jealousy and politics when they gave Pearl Harbor a really bad review on the Wall Street Journal.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2WIBSP7GONPOB	Mr. Mister	Yes, Ben Affleck actually did appear in a few good movies, and one of them is Pearl Harbor.  After reading through so many reviews posted on Amazon.com I have to say that the ratings for this film seem to be the most divided I've ever seen and I'm rather disappointed in the unfavorable ones.Why?  It's the reasons so many give for disapproving, attacking it for being too romantic instead of being a true war film and quibbling about a minor historical inaccuracy or two.  My words to the jeerers is that we're sorry if it wasn't the kind of film you wanted it to be so please don't insult those of us who watched it with an open mind and enjoyed it.About the historical inaccuracies, just remember the makers of BRAVEHEART took MAJOR liberties in totally rewriting the William Wallace story, but how many complaints did you hear?  Pearl Harbor is also criticized for being formulatic and predictable.  True perhaps, but does that automatically qualify the film as a waste of time?  For those who say the attack wasn't depicted horrifically enough, all I can say is that not all of us can bear to see the gritty realism of Saving Private Ryan all over again.  This film was designed for mass appeal after all, not mass disturbance.Indeed, Pearl Harbor succeeds on its own merits other than just the spectacular special effects.  Watch it and appreciate it for what it is (a love story in a historical wartime setting) and not for what you wanted it to be!	4.0	C'mon People, Give It Some Credit !	2006-02-11	5	1	4

If I wanted a film full of facts surely this would be a documentry and I would be better served watching the history channel.  I found this film very enjoyable.  I also took my 12 year old daughter to see this so she could see and understand some of the history behind the War.  If you do not take children to see these films they will soon forget that these things happened. If it was too factual she would have got bored.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3HA0A92FVYHOF	"Mr. Tickle Snort ""Mr. Ticklesnort"""	Michael Bay  made this film having no political or philosophical agenda to bash his audience over the head with.  If a film maker wants to please critics, this is a big mistake when making a war picture.  If he wants to make a great, classic war picture, then this approach is a stroke of genius.What person of my generation can honestly say he knew or cared who Jimmy Doolittle was before they saw this film?  Not me.  Nor did I know the impact of this act of war on the pre-WWII generation.Micheal Bay's goal obviously was not to present a cold, objective view of the events surrounding Pearl Harbor; had he done so people would probably have complained that he'd ripped off Tora Tora Tora. The goal here is to pay tribute to those who died, and those who emerged as heroes from this History making event.Critics seem to miss this somehow, or maybe view such a goal as not being worthwhile.  I disagree.Love it or hate it,  thanks to Bay and Bruckheimer there is a new generation who will honor the admonition to &quot;Remember Pearl Harbor.&quot;  That in and of itself is enough to earn this film a five star rating.	5.0	Very undercredited war film	2002-01-13	4	1	3

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A16QMYEU3YTFR5	Ms. E. C. Dinsdale	Like many people, I saw this film at the cinema and while everyone was saying it was just a 'Titanic' about another disaster that had happened, I really enjoyed the film because I thought it was fantastically produced and the special effects were amazing-the only thing that I thought had let the film down a bit was the 3-way love triangle; but I guess they had to expand the story somehow.I had the video bought for me and I still love the film, but it isn't as impressive on a small screen with comparatively little volume-the special effects are still great but they don't seem AS special!!  So I would recommend buying it only if 1) You really  really loved the film, 2) You have a huge cinema-like TV screen with surround-sound, or 3) You are in to collectibles.	4.0	Get it only if you really enjoyed it at the cinema!	2002-04-30	3	1	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3V9QQMNQFUCNV	"M-Taliesin ""M-Taliesin"""	This is a truly magnificent film. My primary criteria for any film is whether it entertained me, and this one did the job handily.This is not just a historical film focused exclusively on the attack on Pearl Harbor that plunged America into war with Japan 60 years ago. It goes beyond that day of infamy to show us the relationship between two men who grew up together, and found their lives profoundly affected by that event. It also shows how their relationship with one another, and with a woman they both love, are affected by the events unfolding in their time.While the film is somewhat long, running just over 3 hours, it holds viewer interest all the way through. The dedication displayed by director Michael Bay in portraying the era with accuracy is evident throughout. Everything from costumes to sets, from automobiles to planes and ships is faithfully rendered as it might have been in 1941. You feel that you have been transported to that era, and are witness to a different time and more innocent culture. It feels like 1941, and is rendered with complete believability.The only flaw I found in the film is their employ of 3 battleships of later vintage than those that would have been at Pearl Harbor at the outset of World War 2. This is a minor flaw, and easily ignored by all but the most hardcore purist.The special effects are enormous, and buffeted by incredible CGI work. The explosion of the USS Arizona, in particular, is rendered in heartbreaking detail. This particular special effect is totally amazing. So too is the scene of the USS Oklahoma capsizing.Much of what is included in the film are vignettes culled from eyewitness accounts of those who were there and witnessed the events unfold. You will see, throughout the attack, individual details that were provided by the men and women who were there on that fateful day. These individual incidents were faithfully and accurately rendered in the film as they happened on December 7th, 1941. These lend credibility to the film, and help us experience what happened on that day.This film is altogether wonderful, entirely entertaining, and totally marvelous. The cast, led by Ben Affleck, give us believable characters with whom we can identify. The immensity of the project is evident throughout. The audio quality is absolutely breathtaking, and the special effects outstanding!Get this film, enjoy the show, and marvel at the effort involved. I am confident you will find it a rewarding film experience that you will watch time and again. I totally recommend Pearl Harbor. This is a great movie.	5.0	Wonderful!	2001-12-09	2	0	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2EWC48FRNO3YP	"M. Veiluva ""sputnik99"""	"I have to add my two cents to this atrocity of a film, and be at one with the mob howling for the head of the director, Michael Bay.  This is the 'Showgirls' of American war movies, it's that bad.  There, I've said it.1.  I understand that some Hollywood culture-vultures rounded up some actual veterans of the Pearl Harbor battle and ""honored"" them by exposing them to this film.  I'd like to have been able to tell these unfortunate victims that those insensitive moguls are now safely tucked away at Guantanamo with blacked-out goggles and duct tape over their mouths.  I really wish I could.2.  History?  Oh, no, no, no.  It is closer to a version of Army-Navy Comics from 1943, the one where American super-heroes take on Japs single-handed with super-neato flying tanks and rocket planes.  See Rafe join the RAF to teach the Limeys how to really fly.  See Rafe shoot down Jap Zeroes at Pearl Harbor piloting his P-40 like an X-Wing Starfighter, pausing to help out wounded Gis at the aid station, and then help rescue drowning sailors.  See Rafe lead the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo.  See Rafe.... well, that would be giving away the movie's ending.3.  I recall watching a 1942 film on the late night, called ""Air Force"" or some such.  In it, the last B-17 lands at Wake Island before the Japanese, rescues a Marine's puppy dog, and then flys on (the same flight) to blow the whole toy Japanese fleet out of the water.  I guess that movie was 50 years ahead of its time.4.  If ""Pearl Harbor"" admitted to the world  it was nothing more than a dime-store pulp adventure story a-la Indiana Jones, all this (well, leaving out the absurd and interminable menage-a-trois love story) would be moderately tolerable.  But the horror of ""Pearl Harbor"" is that it panders to pass itself off as a serious and meaningful.  This disqualifies the movie from status as a potential camp classic.3.  ""Rafe?""  When was the last time you encountered anyone named ""Rafe?""  The last ""Rafe"" I remember was in Carol Burnett's brief and now sadly unavailable 1980s miniseries, ""Fresno"", a comic parody of the popular evening soap, ""Falcon Crest"", which hilariously substituted a raisin plantation for `Falcon Crest's' winery.  In ""Fresno"", `Rafe' was a bare-chested stud who strolls around rescuing farm-workers from bullies, etc.  Burnett would wrap her lips around the name, ""Rafe...Rafe..."" Well, I guess you had to see it.4.  The Japanese are to this movie what the icebergs are to the Titanic, an random act of God interrupting a love story.  Sort of a ""Days of Our Lives"" meets the Lusitania.5.  No one plays baseball at 7 am on a Sunday morning in December. Others have pointed this out.  Mistakes like this are important.Parental advisory: repeated viewing will make your children retarded, and flunk U.S. History.

I've just seen the new hit blockbuster movie &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; and this movie is a have-to-see.  Most people are discouraged with the romance (which does have one love scene, but it is not graphic or that long) between the three characters, but the romance added to the actual affect of the devestating event that took place on December 7, 1941.  The sound effects, action scenes, and photography really caught how Pearl Harbor actually was.  Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsale all did a fanastic job in bringing the drama and heart-wrenching event to the viewers.  Director Michael Bay did a wonderful job as well capturing the dramatic scenes on the screen.  &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is a GREAT movie for people of all ages.  Do not wait for the movie to come out on VHS or DVD; go see it NOW!!  The big screen just adds to the action and effects of the movie.

I was expecting a high intensity build towards the ultimate climax of the attack itself. Instead, we get the usual Hollywood love fest, Hollywood liberties on the truth (though I am not bothered by the liberties themselves, but sometimes the liberties are too ridiculous!) For example, some of the ships used in the movie to be hit by torpedoes are woefully modern, IE not of WWII time period. The Doolittle Raid, look at the aircraft carrier, it shows an angle that only modern nuclear ACC's have, back then the ACC's were long rectangler shaped vessels.Lastly, I just found it boring and it was like the director was attempting to do a Titanic style story with fictional characters caught in a love triangle all the while the story builds towards the attack as a secondary mentioning. Just way too much Hollywood liberties taken against one of the darkest times for America, and I can't help but feel that the veterans, especially those who were there, should have been given something that respected them more.I will say though, the attack itself is stunning, why I give it two stars... other than that this movie falls flat for me.	2.0	Pearl Harbore, and inaccurate	2004-07-04	5	3	2

He deftly weaves a tapestry of anguish, pain and confusion ... like Affleck must have looked when Bay was directing him. So, to all those people out there who say Michael Bay is nothing but a connected hack with gorgeous flowing hair and one of those whispery beards that make you think about Peter Horton in thirtysomething, I won't argue the point with you.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3IYSXWUHI6P23	N. Cooley	This movie has Jerry Bruckheimer written all over it.  The love story was unbelievably sappy and contrived.  The only redeeming aspect of the movie was the Pearl Harbor attack (which they also managed to screw up by drawing it out for what seemed like an hour).  They should have ended the movie there but instead they had to involve a Baldwin, only making the movie that much worse.  I also despised the subtle attempts to dispel myths that have persisted concerning the attack on Pearl Harbor (i.e. that Roosevelt knew the attack was coming and even welcomed the attack in order to go to war).  Let people make up there own minds instead of inserting historical inaccuracies which portray the studio's version of what the they believe happened.Like I mentioned, the only worthwhile part of the movie was the incredible Pearl Harbor attack scene and the incredibly beautiful Kate Beckinsale.  Other than that, this movie reeked of Hollywood commercialism.  A great historical film??? Not Hardly.  A maudlin love story which cheaply capitalizes on one of the most hallowed events in American history??? That sounds about right.(I can see Jerry Bruckheimer racking his brain trying to figure out how he can portray the story of two NY Firefighters and the events of 11 September 2001.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AJHQUT6X74PB1	"Nicholas Chillianis ""nickdagreek"""	Where to begin?OK.Why in Heaven's name would the producers go through all the effort to digitally recreate &quot;Battleship Row&quot; and waves upon waves of attacking Japanese aircraft, only to show a US NAVY NIMITZ Class nuclear carrier in another scene, and try to palm it off as a Japanese carrier? And the footage of the TICONDEROGA Class Guided Missile Cruisers (First commissioned in 1980), interspersed with the WWII battleships getting blown up, was another anachronistically lovely touch as well.Add to this a sophomoric love triangle to titillate the pre-pubescent girls (and some of their mothers) in the audience, and pitch it all as a tribute to the fighting men of WWII, and you have the recipe for a totally overhyped, &quot;film that will live in infamy&quot;.The most enjoyable part of the tape, for me, was the &quot;History Channel&quot; program that followed the movie, and showed actual footage from 1941, and told the story of some of the unsung heroes of that day. It's a shame that the producers couldn't spare a few minutes from their three hour long tribute to &quot;Love Story&quot;, so rudely interrupted by a few obligatory battle scenes, to do justice to these brave men's story.Do yourself a favor and get the Widescreen version of &quot;Tora, Tora, Tora&quot; instead. No digital &quot;magic&quot;, but an infinitely better telling of the story of the &quot;date that will live in infamy&quot;. Sorry girls, no Ben Affleck either.By the way, the passenger car outside Ben Affleck's train window, &quot;Silver Horizon&quot; was built for the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; in 1948, 7 years after Pearl Harbor.

Ludlum	It's a pity really, that any film with the vast resources and talent that Pearl Harbor had should fail so spectacularly.  With the possible exception of the writer(s?) and director, the forces arrayed in making this film could have put together a true cinema classic.  Instead they turned it into a cocktail joke.This is doubly sad, of course, because the historical events depcited here have so many natural and compelling stories (even fictions) that could and should be told.  I'm tempted to call this film an insult to those who served and/or died that day.  But that's not really fair.

Action, romance, a great storyline, and a great cast!! The film's center of attention is Ben Affleck, who plays Rafe McCawley, and his best friend Josh Hartnett, who plays Danny Walker. Rafe falls in love with a beautiful nurse named Evelyn (played by an outstanding Kate Beckinsale), whom Rafe had the terrible discomfort of leaving her behind to go off with the Royal British army to fight alongside other fighter pilots. When word gets out about Rafe being shot down in action, both Danny and Evelyn were filled with grief over the incident. But in an unexpected twist of fate, Evelyn and Danny became emotionally attached to each other. But, one night, Rafe suddenly returns much to the delight of Evelyn, Danny could not believe it either until Rafe figured out that something went on between the two of them. And then, history intervenes when the love triangle is put on hold and both Rafe and Danny put aside their differences to go out and fight the Japanese fighter pilots that started the attacks on Pearl Harbor, an attack even we Americans never saw coming. The acting in this movie is superb, especially with Cuba Gooding, Jr. playing Dorie Miller, and Jon Voight playing FDR. The soundtrack is outstanding, especially with Faith Hill singing &quot;There You'll Be&quot; in the film. This will definitely be a DVD must-own when I go out and buy it. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is Ben Affleck's best film since &quot;Armageddon&quot;. Josh Hartnett's best film since &quot;Here on Earth&quot;. Kate Beckinsale's best film since &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;. Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s best film since &quot;Men of Honor&quot;. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is truly a movie masterpiece.

I  am deeply disappointed that the youth of this time would be subjected to so much misinformation.  The only plausable fact in the movie is that Pearl Harbor happened.  Even the special effects are phoney.  My, my , all those gas engine prop airplanes moved about the screen as it they were jet aircraft of today.  The only believable special effects were the scenes that were &quot;borrowed&quot; form earlier movies about Pearl.

Critics state that the four category Oscar nominated film focused on the romance part and not so much the events leading up to, during and after the attack on Pearl Harbor. But, didn't ""Titanic"" focus on romance for two hours, then the ship sank and the movie ended? It still won, what, 11 Academy Awards? I enjoyed the film, because it was dynamic and even though the actors didn't really have a great part for one another, they really acomplished their character. The cast was huge and well chosen and the music was tops for that certain type of movie. The visual and sound effects were tremendous and every crew member did their part. I think that the film should deserve more recognition and more praise for its on-screen heroics."	5.0	A Better Mix of Romance and Tragedy than Titanic	2002-02-26	0	0	0

Their is both a love story and action to appeal to both of the genre types. It starts 1 year befor Pearl Harbor took place. Ben Afleck goes over to Europe to join Eagle squadron while his sweetie and best friend go to Pearl Harbor along with the squadron. I have to leave much of the middle out so I don't ruin the movie. After pearl harbor they show the doolitle raid on Tokyo. The doolitle raid for those of you who don't know what it is, is the U.S.'s revenge for pearl harbor. The u.s. took B-25 bombers, and launched them off of carriers, They then bombed Tokyo.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1693N6MO3PJH5	Nimrod	In it's relatively short life, this film has established itself as one of my all-time favourite films... displacing other action/drama/romantic, blockbuster hits (including the timeless cross-generational 'Gone With the Wind', which is *not* a comparison I have ever been impertinent enough to make before now).Within 'Pearl Harbour', the acting is simply superb, (unlike most big-budget Yankee blockbusters).  British Actress Kate Beckinsale, (Nurse Lieutenant Evelyn Stewart), sports a flawless American accent and shines as nurse Evelyn amid a superb cast including Ben Affleck (Captain Rafe McCawley), Josh Hartnett, (Captain Danny Walker), Jon Voight, (President Franklin Roosevelt), Alec Baldwin, (Lt. Colonel Jimmy Doolittle), and Cuba Gooding Jr, (Petty Officer Doris &quot;Dorie&quot; Miller).  Unlike 'Titanic', there is no outrageous overacting amongst the lead characters.The 'romance', (centring upon a tried and tested recipe), a wartime love-triangle between Affleck, Hartnett and Beckinsale is suitably paced to climax as the Japanese zeros appear on the harbour horizon.  Sure, some historical facts have been overlooked in the telling (as indeed, they were in 'Gone With the Wind' as far as the American Civil War was concerned), but the special effects and the aerial combat sequences blew me away... inspiring me to learn more about this pivotal event in war-time history.  Basically, 'Pearl Harbour' is the American equivalent of Australia's plight at 'Gallipolli'.  It has been treated with the respect I feared it would lack before viewing it.When I first heard of inaugural filming preparations for 'Pearl Harbour' around the April of 2000, (back when Gene Hackman was named as a potential leading character... presumably as Lt. Colonel Doolittle), my first comment was, 'this flick will be panned by the critics' as indeed it has been since release... since it's conception in fact.  It focuses upon themes which universal audiences love yet most of the more critics detest, unashamedly nationalist patriotism included.  Yet this film has proven them spectacularly wrong ('Pearl Harbour' being the second-largest opening earner after 'Jurassic Park').  Indeed, Pearl Harbour will age well, unlike 'Titanic' (I personally believe), for the story is enough to stand on it's own... take away the bombing and I would remain suitably entertained throughout.My only criticisms would include, (as a biased, patriotic Australian), the intense 'Americanisation' of W.W.II.  Sure, the Eagle squadron (consisting of American volunteer pilots) was employed with success during the Battle of Britain, but the Yanks did not outshine the Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders, South Africans, Indians nor even the Poles proceeding 1941.  Nevertheless, Affleck establishes himself as the ace of the Battle of Britain, (although the seriousness of the dire situation in Britain at the time of Hitler's [Luftwaffe] raids is accurately portrayed).I have seen this film twice and will probably go again.  I will own it on DVD eventually.  I would recommend it to anyone... a *perfect* score!	5.0	Simply *SUPERB*!  How else to describe this timeless gem?!	2001-06-20	8	3	5

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A29ZTW8IH9S5WR	Noonie Fortin	I wasn't born yet the first time our country was attacked. So I learned about Pearl Harbor and WW II as I grew up from my family and school teachers. As I got older I learned more about the war and the attack on Hawaii. Each time I saw various documentaries or movies that included the attack it amazed me that we were caught with our pants down so long ago. AND just a few months ago a similar event took place in my home state.BUT I saw all the news clips and film trailers about &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; and I waited to see the movie for myself. Having seen &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; in the movies the first time it came out I chose to wait for &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; to come on video to see it.Ben Afleck and Josh Harnett portrayed the two young men who became pilots just in time for the war. They also vied for the affections of a nurse played by Kate Beckinsale. While the beginning of the movie was a bit slow it picked up when they were sent overseas.However-when the actual attack on Pearl Harbor started I was startled. Even though I knew it was going to happen, watching and hearing it was entirely different. The cinematography was amazing. Whether it was from the air or the ground, from the land or the sea, each bomb, each torpedo, each explosion showed me what it must have been like that awful morning.Cuba Gooding Jr made another good appearance in this film. Portraying a cook who went topside during the bombing and armed a machine gun-something he wasn't really allowed to do because he was black. Jon Voight made a brief appearance as President Franklin D Roosevelt.I look forward to watching the movie again when I can sit in one place to watch it from end to end. Yes even though I had rented the video I still wasn't able to watch it all in one sitting. But I would recommend this film also.	4.0	The cinematography was amazing!	2004-01-29	4	2	2

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AD50DBYXM129I	nsnyder	Most people who were not there talk about Pearl Harbor and say what a tragedy it was.  We look at statistics and possibly view photographs of what happened on December 7, 1941, and said how awful that must have been.  In most cases, we feel for the people who died on that day, but this was the first time I actually felt like I was standing on the decks of those anchored ships with them.This film puts you in the middle of the attack with astounding visuals and encompassing sound.  The story presents you with characters that you can empathize with.  It makes you realize that these events were not just numbers or pictures in a book, they were young Americans who got caught in the middle of a world conflict before they, or their leaders, were ready for it.This story has been given to us almost sixty years later, during a holiday weekend that is meant to honor the men and women like the ones who died in battles such as this one.  The film is presented to us as a remembrance for those who were there and did not survive the day.As I said, almost sixty years have elapsed since that day in 1942.  The technology that brought these events to film was, probably, nothing more than a dream at that time.  It was the creative vision of this film's actors and production company that made the technology tell such a powerful story.To use an old clich&eacute;, a picture is worth a thousand words and, as some may already know, a movie presents us with twenty-four pictures every second.  Multiply that into a 165-minute movie, and you get more words than I can possibly present to you in the small space that I have been provided here.  All I can tell you is to celebrate the bravery of those who were at Pearl Harbor by going to see this movie.  Open yourself to the images and sounds that are presented to you.And, never forget the anguish that the whole world, not just America, was going through during this tragic period in human history.	5.0	Once again, history comes alive on the silver screen.	2001-05-27	5	3	2

There is very little historical accuracy in this film. I am not usually one to be very critical of this, but considering the subject matter of this film I felt that it was very significant. Also, the whole stupid love story part was totally unnecessary and very poorly done. The ridiculous love triangle made me feel like I was watching an episode of Jerry Springer. Also, I felt as though the last hour of the film was also unnecessary. The only reason that it was in there was to show that we got our revenge which isn't really even true. In truth, that mission had very little effect on anything. However, I must commend the action scene. It was very good. If you want to watch this movie, fast forward through the first hour, watch it for 45 minutes, then turn it off.

They've done something for us youngsters, that we could never repay. So what does the ''greatest generations'' youth do to honor them? Make a horrible movie like this. Pearl Harbor is one of the most overhyped, and overplayed movies ever. Instead of having the great and powerful war plot in Saving Private Ryan, Pearl Harbor was more like Armageddon. It was all about the action. Maybe 1/3 of the movie was focused on the characters. But all they focused on were the two best buds and their love interest. At first it seemed okay, but the rivalry and the acting got old very quick. Ben Affleck is one of my favorites, but I dont know what got in his mind to make a movie like this. It tried way too hard to have everything for everybody (romance, action, humor). But what the script-writers didnt realize is we didnt come to see a movie that had something for everybody, we came to see a war movie!	1.0	Dont let the cast fool you, THIS MOVIE BITES!	2001-06-12	7	6	1

When you see this movie, you'll know what I mean. I haven't found one person who hasn't wanted to see it again. Everything about it just makes you feel like you're part of the movie. I honestly was crying during several parts of it. But like many think, it's not a blood and guts war movie or a sappy love story. It's got everything you like about a movie in it. And all the actors are so real and their characters really come to life! It's definitely the best movie I've ever seen!	5.0	All the elements of a good movie	2001-06-03	3	1	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2D4MJ06A9UHE5	O. Stinger	I know this movie is almost universally despised, but I can't stop loving it! There just aren't any faults substantial enough to compromise the sheer entertainment value of this film! The cinematography is fantastic, the music is great, the CGI effects are astounding (especially when you turn on the 5.1 surround sound), the story is entertaining, and the cast works. Ben Affleck is no worse an actor than Orlando Bloom or Colin Farrell or any of the other new Hollywood heartthrobs, Josh Harnett is good, and if I were either of them, I'd fall for Kate Beckinsale too! The love triangle plot may be hackneyed, but I can't help being moved by it. Makes me wish I were 25 again. The budget obviously didn't allow for filming in Japan, so the scenes of the attack planning were also shot in Hawaii, doubling for Japan, but even so, effort is made within the confines of the film to show the Japanese, especially naval genius Isoroku Yamamoto in a noble light. For historical accuracy, I'll turn to books or the History Channel, but for superb youthful entertainment, I'll come back to this movie over and over again. Get the director's cut for the full-effect of the action scenes.	5.0	Can't help loving this movie!	2008-03-25	3	2	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A35TN5YGURE6IV	"""oxzo"""	"When you read about the Pearl Harbor attack in history books you see the figures on how many died and what ships where hit but when you see the reenactment of the battle in this movie it will give you a further sense of why it was such an outrage.  Keep in mind that as bad as it looks on screen it's nothing compared to what the reality was when war came to Hawaii and to an unprepared U.S. Navy.Writing as someone who is a graduate student in the field of history I like to see movies like this come out because it raises awareness that these things are not boring and that people had lives just as they do today that were torn apart for years in the war.That being said much of the movie does not revolve around the actual battle but rather introducing you too and getting you to like the group of soldiers and nurses who eventually witness and bear the brunt of the Japanese attack.  There is a certain amount of the standard Hollywood mechanisms of romance, heroism, and special effects wizardry that probably does go astray from what the reality was but I think it works well in this film.  The story line has humor, romance, and sadness because of the characters some of whom are killed in the course of the film are not the ones you expect.It's also cool to see that the people who made this decided to feature and acknowledge the contributions of US armed forces female personnel in the war.  True they were not front line combatants as such but in war the front line can shift and does not distinguish between combatant forces and support forces so they were very brave as well.  It's also worth noting that some of the scenes were in fact filmed at the very location of the attacks.  I believe it was Ben Affleck that commented you could still see the pockmarks from the bullets fired by the Japanese in the concrete as they strafed U.S. personnel on the ground.  They also touch on the role of blacks in the film, on the battleships they were primarily galley workers but as with the nurses became front line combatants in the battle and shed their blood just like everyone else aboard.This is a movie that is rated PG-13 and I would say it probably does push the envelop on R rated because of the graphic battle and hospital scenes although they are a relatively small part of the film overall.  Younger children might possibly be disturbed by what is depicted and probably either should not see it or should watch it with a parent who can explain things and reassure them.  I say this partly because of the uncertainty facing the country at the time I write this following less than a year after the September 11 attacks.As the other great attack on America in modern times this story is particularly poignant.Although the movie is principally about the Pearl Harbor attack it also covers the Doolittle raid on Tokyo.  There was talk about the Japanese actually invading the west coast in those days and yet FDR ordered a symbolic attack that resulted in the bombing of Tokyo by a handful of U.S. bombers.Bottom line I like the movie and while it is long on story and short on historical accuracy in some respects it is still a terrific vehicle to introduce audiences to a significant historical event.  ""December 7, 1941, a day which will live in infamy"" (Franklin Delano Roosevelt) just as September 11, 2001 will.I recommend this movie at least as a rental especially if you don't know a lot about the battle that brought the U.S. into World War II and changed the world and would like to hear and see a little more."	4.0	History Isn't All Names & Dates	2002-07-28	0	0	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2NSM690602Y9V	Pacific Theater of Operations Knowledge	After seeing Pearl Harbor, I found myself asking questions as to why certain things were left out, and why other things things (ie: The Doolittle RAID) were put in. Jumping between the Americans and the Japanese was a good idea, just poorly executed. Wallace should have thought about using those scenes to help fill in a younger generation with some knowledge instead of making Hartnett a playboy in the parachute hanger. The film left those who do not know any better to believe that the Japanese were extremely pround and honored to have caught us sleeping. that is not the case. (See Samarai Code) This is also the first film about that day and it's events where the code phrase &quot;Climb Mount Nikita&quot; were not used prior to the attack. Looking at most of the relastionships between the characters brought the mini-series PEARL into mind. It was almost as if Wallace was watching that while writing this screenplay. The attack scene is beautiful eye-candy. If you're looking to be entertained by computer generated effects and some cheesey dialog this is a great movie to see. If you want to experience the truest testiment to that fateful day, I suggest that you rent &quot;TORA TORA TORA.&quot; It is a far better dipiction of events, is just as entertaining, and you get to skip out on Affleck's in-ability to act. Lastly, why even cast Cuba Gooding Jr. as a historical character if you're not goign to develop him any more than by showing him boxing and firing rounds at Japanese planes during the attack. Some time off the end of the Doolittle raid could have been used to help out here. The film was well worth seeing at least once, but don't break the bank just to see it in theaters.	3.0	EYE CANDY, not much else though	2001-05-29	0	0	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1GAZD28ZEJCIO	Pamela Anderson	I am 28 years old and I am not sorry to say that I loved (yes loved) this movie. I don't really know how it compared to the historical event because our wonderful schools in this country did not teach my age group about it. Which is very sad. But I digress. I thought the acting was great and the special effects were top notch. (Typical of Michael Bay movies)  But I am a female so that might have something to do with the fact that I liked this movie so much. But I generally DO NOT watch love stories or as some call them &quot;chick flix&quot;.  I do own the DVD and I would not trade any other movie for it. But this is just my opinion.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1EAIU4NH395OR	Pamela Davala	I feel that I am a well rounded and college educated middle age woman who was born during this era and after reading all the bad professional reviews about pictures I wanted to see, I decided to go and see Pearl Harbor and make up my own mind.. I certainly am glad I did!  Not only did I like the acting but the whole film caught my attention and held it for more than 3 hours.  My husband was with me and while he is not partial to romances he enjoyed it as much as I did... I will certainly rent it again as I thought it was well done. I don't understand some of the critics who pan an awful lot of the movies that I end up loving and give high marks to movies that I go to see and then can't figure out what ever the critics saw in them. I'm not a prude but find some of the comedies that are rated highly are a total insult to my integrety and the ones they don't like tell a story which doesn't have to include smut or foul language, and is not only pleasant to watch but lets me leave a theater feeling like not only have I learned something, lost myself in the story or just completely enjoyed the action on the screen.  How sad it is to feel almost guilty to enjoy something that the professional critics panned!  From now on I will be sure to trust my own judgement and let the critics lose out on some of the best movies that are out there.  (I don't mean that I don't agree with them sometimes after I have read the review and then seen the movie but on a whole I trust me more than I trust them.) Go and enjoy something that you might not have seen if you rely on these reviews.	4.0	A Common Moviegoer's Review	2001-05-29	7	6	1

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2LOZ6XG7WRWCS	Paresh Swali	The Shots of the ocean and ships look as realistic as the day of Infamy was in December 1941.  I later found out that it was computer generated and the graphics do make things look realistic as the real day.  The movie is 3 hours long and at times it becomes bouring.  There are two best friends from childhood days.  One goes to war and is presumed dead, the dead hero's girl becomes girlfried of the other.  Then suddenly the one presumed dead returns back alive only to find out that his girl has become girlfriend of his best friend.  This is adult explicit material fit for Love story like movies rather than Pearl Harbour and too much time being given to it makes it little bouring.  The action scenes of attack and response of attack on Tokyo (as they happened in real life) are superb.When attacking Tokyo, the carriers have to be withing 400 miles from Japan.  But they are spotted at 640 miles and the split second decision is taken to attack giving aircrafts a low range on fuel to reach safe landing destination in China.  It all happened in real life and we are glad to re live the spirit of brave soilders.	5.0	Pearl Harbour	2003-02-12	3	0	3

"I was surprised to see all the negative review of the movie.  I loved it.  I had family who served in the Pacific in World War II, and virtually everyone who was around at that time can tell you a ""Where I was when I heard about Pearl Harbor"" story.The relationships were great and true to a more family oriented less free sex and welfare time and values.  True, innocent bonding of buddies and brothers, and the likelihood that a brother or best friend would wind up with the girl if the guy was killed are true to the mores of the time.  It's perfectly logical that your brother or best friend would like your girl, you were all likely to have similar values, goals and aspirations.  This was a time period where most women did not work outside the home unless they had to, and if they did, they were likely in nursing or teaching.  There was no taxpayer funded welfare for generation after generation of unwed mothers.  Men married a girl they impregnated; that was the right and honorable and socially expected thing to do.  Cultural values supported responsiblity, loyalty and self-sacrifice adn did not promote selfishness.  Today selfishness is glorified in the media and even in schools and churches (liberation theology).Danny is my favorite character, as he shows real heart, kindness and consideration even as a child dealing with his hard and somewhat abusive father.  He alone makes sure everyone else's heart is taken care of.At the time the movie came out, I did some research and there were a couple of pilots who flew out of Hickam and made the first response by shooting down a number of attacking Japanese planes.  They were honored for it.When the movie came out, a number of World War II vets were interviewed, and they all liked the movie, including the love story.The haters, I think, are far more cynical people, (most likely liberals) and likely not imbued with the values of that time period.I thought it was well done.  Be forewarned, even the Arizona memorial is now becoming politically correct and giving the ""Japanese"" point of view on Pearl Harbor, which is the real insult.  A memorial to murdered Americans does them dishonor by displaying the perverted opinions of their imperialist murderers---and before someone starts having leftist hysterics, I refer not to modern, relatively democratic Japanese, but to the literally imperialist and totalitarian Japanese empire, which is no more, and does not in fact, even have the same flag.  It's a memorial.  But then, there are some among us who think it's all right for a radical imam to plant a flag of conquest on Ground Zero."	5.0	Great Movie, Inspiring	2011-06-05	4	1	3

The story was SO STUPID that it made me sick. This movie had the potential to be great but it turned out to be trash. I'll just say this; whenever the girl in this movie falls in love with a guy...that guy dies. If she's lucky he comes back to life. Her only problem is she's already in love with her dead lover's best friend. This would be a good movie if the story wasn't SUPPOSED to be about Pearl Harbor.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AVZDIRALGLLW4	Patrick Macdonald	I went into this movie expecting it to be a waste of three hours, I came out stunned.  With many comparisons being made to Titanic, this film far surpasses its extremely overrated predecessor.  The movie's love story is far better than the cliche ridden schlock of Titanic.  The care free relationship of Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale was reminiscent of the attitude in the time preceding December 7th, and then that of Josh Hartnett and Beckinsale just added more to the Drama of Hartnett's and Affleck's friendship and than added a bit during the battle and aftermath as well.Onto the attack scene of Pearl Harbor, quite simply put, wow.  The drama and intensity rivals that of the opening scene in Saving Private Ryan.  Anyone who writes it off as simple special effects is incorrect.  The attack scene perfectly depicts the confusion and the horrors one would imagine happened that early morning December 7th despite minor inaccuracies.In conclusion, the movie may not be oscar caliber, but it was certainly very well made.  The attack scene is one of the most spectacularily put together war scenes in film history and the romance certainly didn't hurt the film.  If you haven't seen the movie yet I highly recommend you rent it.	4.0	Highly Underrated war film	2001-12-02	6	3	3

O'Hara ""taparaho"""	My preconception of the movie was negative based on reviews by movie critics. However, recieving this DVD as a gift, I watched it with an open mind and found I really enjoyed it. No it is not a history channel documentary, as the ney sayers seemed to want it to be. It is a story about a handful of people caught up in the events surrounding the Pearl Harbor attack, and later the Doolittle raid on Tokyo. I found it to be excellent movie, that held my attention, such that I could not wait to slip in the second disc and finish the movie. The filming is great, the sound is powerful, and the storyline intense. The movie reveals the beauty of the Hawaiian Islands, and the tranquility prior to the attacks -- much like pre-9/11 NYC.Most critics focus on the love story as a detraction, but I actually found it to be a humorous addition to the movie, which actually depicted the heroes of the story as real people. I found it touching, funny, suspenseful, and at times corny -- as of course that period of time was, compared to what we percieve as the norm today. I couldn't wait to watch this again the following night with my wife, who agreed with me that this was a great movie.	4.0	I Liked This Movie!	2001-12-30	0	0	0

I believed the scenes were very real and captured the hysteria and shock that our countymen and women found themselves on that fateful morning. It was the worst of times but in a strange way it was a romantic time, because our country was still in love with the pride of family, country and God. I was so disgusted and hurt to see the ratings of a movie that I will always remember as one of the greatest of this decade. ....As for the love story, I loved it more than I can say. I fell in love w/ both young men and thought the gal was a doll. I want to see it over and over.... I have told everyone of this great movie.

Horrible writing, a cliche-ridden plot and some phone-it-in performances gave many scenes an almost comical flare. More than once during the first thrity minutes did I have to elbow my wife to stop laughing or making cracks at the WB/UPN teen drama-like dialogue.It's not the concept of the love triangle as the movie's secondary plot that's the problem. It's that it's a horribly done love triangle. They went full tilt for a Titanic-type love story and failed miserably. Instead of pulling at the heart strings, the movie only manages to by sappy - and at times, very funny.Great special effects.

Batt ""battman1@chollian.net"""	"Most people who complain about this movie are worried about the historical inaccuracies and there are some, but what movie does not take liberties when dealing with history? They also complain about the love story presented. Okay it may not be the best. Every movie about the attack on Pearl Harbor has one, however. If there was no story line, you may as well be watching a war documentary. What is great about this movie is watching the attack scenes. The attack scenes last the longest of any of the Pearl Harbor movies made. The reason to see any movie about Pearl Harbor is to see the attack itself. The most impressive thing about this movie is that they made it with accurate appearing ships and aircraft. I never liked ""Tora Tora Tora"" because the Zero fighters did not look like Zero fighters. They used old Texan Trainer aircraft painted up like Zeros. To some people who don't know the difference I suppose it doesn't matter but to those of us that do, it's annoying. Even movies like ""Patton"" you never see a Sherman Tank. You see tanks from the 1960's used. ""Battle of the Bulge"" you see the Germans using American tanks. Why spend all that money to make a war movie and use the wrong tanks and aircraft? They do it because they know most people can't tell the difference and it saves them money.That is why I enjoy watching movies such as ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" because the directors care about realism and accurate aircraft, ships and tanks. ""Empire of the Sun"" is also very accurate. This makes a great war movie for me."	5.0	Special Effects -Great. Accurate Appearing Ships and Planes.	2009-07-24	5	3	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A26972KFFGMG0W	Peter F. Ward	All right I know that Pearl Harbor since its release date has been getting nothing but horrible reviews from just about every critic who'd seen it. I personally thought it was an excellent movie. The authenticity of every thing about the film was almost down to a science. Aside from Ben Affleck's 90's style haircut everything from clothing to wall posters were all well placed and everything.  Now we come to the acting. Every one in the film did a great job portraying their charecters and making them seem real. The only real problem I noticed in the acting was Ben Affleck's southern accent. I've got nothing against Ben Affleck, in fact I think he's a very good actor it's just that he'd have done a much better job with his charecter if he'd just not used an accent.  And last but not least, the bombing sequence. This was absolutely the best aspect of the film. The second the first bomb falls, you'll be on the edge of your seat. Not only that but the scenes where the Japanese were planning the attack were awesome. All in all this is a must see of a film.	4.0	Bay is a genius	2008-10-09	6	3	3

That was exactly what I said when I was leaving the theater on the Saturday of Memorial Day Weekend.  It was good, it was emotional, action packed, romantic, and the funny at times too (that guy who studders when he's nervous is a little ridiculous though).  The acting was also very good.  Afleck usually does do good, but he did suprisingly good in this movie.  It also has what we call the &quot;Hallmark Moment&quot; when you see Afleck fighting, hear his voice reciting letters he wrote and then you see his girlfriend reading them.  Every war movie  should have that.  Plus, he has the most predictible first line is his letter which is &quot;It's different here&quot; it was so predictible.  Oh well, we can still say its truly original.So, baisically, we can call this movie this summers war movie.  It completely fits that name too.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A150G96V43R1G4	Phil Behnke	Hollywood sure loves trends. The latest one is where women are super smart and super tough but men are weak dummies. The photography, effects and action scenes were as good as the hype but the film suffers from feminist attitudes. Ben Affleck's character is nice to this witchy nurse and she never gives us a reason to like her. She's vain, cruel and utterly pothetic from the moment she stabs him with the needle, &quot;because he was getting fresh&quot; as she later brags to her friends. He was only trying to flirt but after what she did he should have grabbed the needle and stabbed her back. See how funny she thinks that is! Oh, I'm sorry that would be politically incorrect nowadays. The most embarassing scene though is after the bombing in the hospital. Everyone is panicking and a doctor freezes and doesn't know what to do until this same macho witchy female orders him to get busy. I am sure that every doctor in theatre audiences nation-wide scoffed at that. What a complete insult to both doctors and to men. And finally, this business of her being the reason two guys (best friends) start fighting is ludicrous! Of course this was written to delight women, but it is painfully unrealistic. It simply almost never happens. Two men who are close friends fighting over a woman? It ain't gonna happen ladies. Guys just simply don't care as much as you'd like to believe. As if she's all that anyway, please! This soap-opera story drags for the first hour and a half making the same points over and over until the predictable scene where Ben Affleck re-appears. This first half could've been trimmed down to about twenty minutes. There's nothing wrong with a chick film, but if movie-makers want to get money from both women and men they should show a little respect for each. What's sad is young girls will see this movie and think this is the way to treat men. What a shame!	3.0	A male-bashing chick film	2001-07-05	2	2	0

But other than that, this is an over-glorified wash-up with too many cliches and too much patriotism. Throughout the film we are constantly given the image of the Japanese being completely evil and if you don't feel that in the middle of the viewing, you certainly will when it comes to the voice-over at the end.The love triangle is just something that should have never been implemented in the first place. Half the time this doesn't even feel like a war movie. Instead it gives off the impression of some sort of bad TV Sitcome hoping to attain cheap thrills. And some of the humor is just downright childish. If this film was hoping to gain respect for it's dramatic story-telling, it has gone nowhere close to it's target.The characters are just too cliched. Two cocky ace pilots, one beautiful lady and a whole bunch of sterotyped buddies. Cuba Gooding, while I do consider him a great actor, has no real purpose in the movie at all. He has no memorable lines at all, and really doesn't have an effect on the other characters at all. I have a feeling that the people behind this movie simply felt that casting Cuba would guarantee this film becoming gold.You will overall be better off with Saving Private Ryan. This film is nothing more than a movie you would watch with your girlfriend, and that in itself is a disgrace. And let me close out with this word: Hiroshima. Let's investigate whether or not the Japanese were really that evil.	2.0	Far Too Patriotic	2002-03-03	3	2	1

We were not disappointed - it was that bad.  Unlike my husband, I did not have any problem with the actors - they did the best they could with some of the worst dialogue ever written.  The love story was trite, the battle scene looked too much like &quot;Titanic&quot; and the whole movie felt like it was an hour too long.  Every once in a while there was a small, fleeting moment of a good movie - such as every time Dan Aykroyd was on screen.  Also, I got the sense that Cuba Gooding Jr. had wandered into the wrong movie. He was very good but I have a feeling much of his footage was edited out to make room for the completely overdone love triangle.

Instead we get another hour of gearing up for and executing a lack-luster bombing mission.I went in expecting another block buster with mass appeal and that is what I got...except that this time, it seemed like the writing was transparent in that it wasn't a secret what the writers were trying to do when they were attempting to endear the characters to the audience. I really wanted to care more about the things that were happening to the characters but the poor character developement left me feeling apathetic towards the characters. It seemed like you could sum up what you learned about the main characters in one sentence.The battle scenes were spectacular, as expected from this directing team. I believe that if there is a reason to see this one in the theater, it is because of the 40 minute bombing raid. The impact of the scenes just can't be duplicated on a television.I agree with a lot of the other reviewers in their accounts of the love story. It seemed especially unromantic for the amount of time that was spent on it (not that I went to the movie expecting a romantic masterpiece- just a story that didn't take away from the gravity of the tragedy that took place).I am not familiar with the historical details of Pearl Harbor so I didn't really notice any huge disparities in the account, but having read that other reviewers were disgusted with some of the inaccuracies makes me like the movie even less.If you're seeing this movie for the battle scenes, see it in the theater.

As some of the other reviewers have also said, when I first went to watch Pearl Harbor, I wasn't sure what to expect. I looked up most of the reviews here in Amazon and found some people loving it... others digusted with it. But when I went to watch it for myself, I just loved it from the start. Of course there were some parts which I didn't like about the movie. First of all, I loved Josh Hartnett as Danny in the movie. I mean, he was just great! I was crying a lot when he died, actually, most everyone was crying at the theaters when it got to that part. The thing I didn't like about the movie is when the character of Kate Beckinsale just doesn't seem to make up her mind who she's in love with, Rafe or Danny. It's like ""if ones dead, then I'll love the other one."" Throughout the whole movie I wasn't sure if Beckinsale was really in love or not. I could tell that about Affleck and Hartnett but Beckinsale... well, the love plot was kind of weak. But I really loved all the action during the attack on Pearl Harbor and also the attack on Tokyo. Yeah, Alec Baldwin was good as Doolittle. Anyway I liked the movie a lot and am sure others will enjoy it, too. And don't watch it thinking that it's very historical and very correct.

Do I really need to see Alec Baldwin's individual hair folicles? The special effects are nice, but I think they over did it a little.  Unless you take the time to get the know the people on the Arizona, when the ship blows up, who gives a damn.The historical inaccuracies are many. Since when are you alowed to fight in another country's airforce, during a war, and remain on active duty?  When does the Navy give the Army pilots their anual check-up?  Why are fighter pilots flying bombers?  For all intents and purposes, Rafe and Danny should of crashed their bombers.  The inaccuracies are way to many to list. The acting at points is terrible, and the mood at times is all wrong.  When Admiral Yamamoto's aid congradulates the Admiral, they might as well had the Admiral reply, ""Yes, we did very well, oh by the way, I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant.""  At least have him say the full quote (""I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve"")  Mako has forgotten more about acting in his 40+ years at it than the 3 main stars will ever learn in a lifetime.  I really don't see what is good about this movie (except for the musical score and the aerial combat).  I just feel sorry for those unfourtunate souls in Japan who will waste thousands of yen to see a bad movie like this.

But when is the last time I liked a movie that the critics liked or hated a movie the critics hated? Maybe Saving Private Ryan, which was released three years ago.  Other than that I haven't liked many movies that critics have also liked.  Critics today base their reviews on things out of English classes: symbolism, themes, and morals.  They're fine, but sometimes you just want to see a good action movie.  Or even a romance.  Pearl Harbor had both of these, and as predictable as the romance was, it was still the best romance movie I have ever seen (that's not saying much, but I liked it).  Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, and even Alec Baldwin perform incredibly.  This was the first film I have seen with Josh Hartnett or Kate Beckinsale, but they are both promising young actors.  Ben Affleck, who I was first introduced to in 6th grade with The Voyage of the Mimi, has proven he can act well in movies such as Dogma(if you haven't seen it, see it, its hilarious).  Affleck is even better in Good Will Hunting, which he won an Oscar for.  I was surprised at the small role of Cuba Gooding, Jr.  He seems overemphasized in the previews, yet he is only in about ten minutes of the film.  His brief boxing match, brief meeting with Evelyn(Beckinsale), and his effort to shoot down a plane.  The historical significance of this movie was irrelevant; if you want history watch the History Channel or get a book on Pearl Harbor.  This movie is for our entertainment, and as a big history buff, I hope it gets more people interested in the social sciences.  The acting in itself was worth the price of admission.  The forty minute attack scene was worth the admission.  The movie is well worth the price of admission.  I plan to see this many more times.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a good movie.  If you usually disagree with critics, you'll love this movie.  If you usually agree with critics, you'll probably like this movie.	5.0	What do critics know?	2001-06-07	2	1	1

The feather-headedness of ALL the females is insulting and stereotyping and deadly.But it wasn't just acting.  After all, Josh Harnett and Cuba Gooding and Jon Voight aren't too bad, considering.  It's also atrocious writing.  It seldom rises even to the level of cliche.And pacing.  Everything is glacially SLOW.  The movie actually takes longer than the events themselves.And characterization.  To say these characters are shallow is to give them too much credit.  They are way beyond shallow and into the territory of the transparent.  They are made of smoke and acetate.And tension--or lack thereof.  The characters are so depthless and the pacing so static, you can't honestly care which of the interchangeable heroes gets the girl, or even who wins the war.  If THIS is what America is all about, maybe the Japanese should win.But I think worst of all (and this is saying a lot) is the music.Seldom or never have I heard such unadulterated schmaltz.  Endless glissandi of strings, tear-jerking angel choirs, cliche-dramatic horns--every second.It amazes me that even Hollywood, as good at trivializing as it is, could reduce something like the Pearl Harbor attack to a soap opera for sixth graders.Dull.  Dumb.  Dreary.  Deadly.  Dolorous.  Damp.	1.0	Damp	2006-11-27	7	5	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AER15RIMV8E6D	Pumpkin Man	It's been 67 years since that tragic day when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. Although in the movie, they add a 'love triangle' to make it more like a soap opera. It's awesome when America starts fighting back! There are some really good special effects to make it look authentic. I remember I saw this in theatres when it came out, and there was one part where I cried.

That's all it's worth.All you folks who know anything at all about the early 1940's and the real Pearl Harbor, rent it, watch it for the action sequences, return it, and forget it.  This has nothing to do with what actually happened, and it carries no ""feel"" whatsoever of the early `40's.  Most, not all, but most of the people who are giving the best reviews are those who do not know their history and are willing to accept anything which looks good, and what the ""critics"" tell them is good.Trust me... the animation is the only redeming factor in this movie.History goes out the window on a greased skid, so if you're expecting to learn anything about the attack, or WWII in general... again, forget it.  The two fighter pilots never saw the Doolittle raid, but survived the war as successful pilots.  Ken Taylor became a Brigader General and at last report is living in Ancorage, Alaska.  George Welch (of the grape juice family) became a test pilot for North American Avaition after the war, and was killed in an air crash.  The movie gives the impression that these were the only two to become airborne, when in fact there were nearly twenty others.Another irritation is the Japanese sub-titles are tiny, and some, not being in dark boxes, are invisible against the background.In a nutshell, the action sequences were so-so, and the rest was BORING!  If you want to see a much better movie about Pearl Harbor, stick with Tora, Tora, Tora."	1.0	NOT history, and not even very entertaining	2002-01-26	3	2	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A319YRDK8Y39N	"""qmlhcb"""	Michael Bay's film commemorating the attack on Pearl Harbor tries to relive the story of a love affair set against a disaster like the film Titanic does, but it tries too hard.Pearl Harbor should have been three separate films. The movie jumps back and forth between the love triangle of Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett and the political dealings of the U.S. and Japanese government. In other words, it's trying to have the intimate, emotional story of Titanic, and the political, historical story of Thirteen Days. Then, thrown in the mix for some unknown reason, are scenes with Cuba Gooding Jr. as the first commended black soldier, which feels like it's just tacked into the movie. There's barely any connection between him and the other main characters. His story deserved its on movie, not as an afterthought in this film. Michael Bay should have decided if he wanted to make a historically accurate account of Pearl Harbor, or an emotional and intimate portrayal of a group of friends caught in the middle of the attack.This movie tries too hard to be too many things, and that is why it fails.But, that is not to say there isn't anything worthwhile in Pearl Harbor. Perhaps one of the most visually astonishing battle sequences ever put to film is in this movie. The actual attack is both beautiful and horrifying. If feels like there were really cameras there to capture it. The 45-minute-attack is simply amazing, and worth multiple viewings.However, where Titanic succeeds in mixing the love storyline in with the disaster, Pearl Harbor puts the love story aside for 45 minutes, and picks it up later. The attack felt like a different film.Another problem is the film tries to manipulate the audience to feel patriotic and emotional. I don't have a problem with a film invoking a feeling of national pride, but certain pieces of dialogue and scenes try so hard to make the audience feel something, it loses any subtlety. I don't like it when a movie basically tells me loud and clear &quot;Feel sad now, and patriotic!&quot; I prefer the more effective subtly Titanic uses.This movie had potential, but lost it through its schizophrenic nature.	3.0	Tries to be the Titanic of Pearl Harbor	2002-08-11	4	3	1

I waited to see it when it was released on DVD.  I thought it well worth the wait.  After reading so many reviews in the papers and listening to reviews on tv I did not know what to expect.  They did not do justice to this movie.  I usually find the movies with the worst reviews, are the ones that I enjoy the best.  I'm 50 years old and I have been enthused about Pearl Harbor since I was in junior high school.  The acting by all the actors was very good.I enjoyed the comedy, the romance, the action and also, the way they showed both sides of the attack.  It showed true friendship between two life long friends, and no matter what, they remained friends.  I have lent the DVD to a few of my friends and have heard nothing but praise for it.  I can't wait to get it back and watch it again.  Thank you for letting me express my opinion.	5.0	Good job, Ben, Kate, and Michael	2001-12-23	5	0	5

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1NS373MZG6IVY	"Ray Gordon -- Bettor Off Single ""Author, 'Bet..."	"A movie similar to ""The Patriot"" in that it takes an American War and sets against it a touching personal story, while doing its best to sanitize black spots in our history and smooth out history to make it a better plot device, at the expense of depth.  Racism is presented as merely an afterthought, and there's Cuba Gooding, Jr. playing a black Navy cook for one of two times.The movie appears historically accurate to the extent that it focuses on the attack.  Minor events can and should be made fictitious so as not to focus on specific individuals the way a documentary would.  The story you see in the movie is one which could have happenend; fragments of it almost certainly happened, like the underage runaway who lies about her age to get into the Navy.  The cause of the love triangle looks like it came out of a modern soap opera, but that can be forgiven.The movie has three distinct parts: before, during, and post-attack, and could almost have been broken up into three separate movies (the movie runs LONG, almost four hours).  The attack sequence is a bit unnerving for Americans who aren't used to seeing us get slaughtered, but The Patriot already covered that ground successfully.  As in The Patriot, the Japanese perspective is given a voice, including one brief scene of a young Japanese soldier writting a love letter in which he speaks of the willingness to die for his country.For those who put down the writing of the film, it did make effective use of foreshadowing twice, once where Rafe and Danny play ""chicken"" in the air, with Rafe defending the ""stunt"" as a way of ""keeping his edge"" (later on in the film they use this stunt in combat), and in another, where the Cuba Gooding character complaints to Evelyn about not being allowed to fire weapons yet.  ""Let's hope you never have to"" is her eerie response.While D-Day may have been the beginning of the end of World War II, the war's turning point could be traced to the point at which the remains of the Pacific Fleet, in the midst of being attacked by an airborne fleet numbering almost four hundred, began to fight back from the ground, and in the air, taking out 29 enemy aircraft.  At that point, the third wave of the attack was called off because the element of surprise, Japan's major weapon, was gone.For anyone who wonders why we dropped atomic weapons on Japan, Pearl Harbor answers them.  This was a brutal enemy of tremendous intelligence and force, using weapons specifically designed to destroy us and which were superior to our own.On the social side, the film provides a bit of a time capsule of the racism and sexism inherent in the era: blacks are shown playing music, boxing, and performing menial tasks in uniform, while women are shown in the nurturing roles of nurses, wielding influence over the men on a personal level while leaving them in charge institutionally.  The image portrayed in both cases is not one of oppression, but of a system in which gender and racial roles were well-defined and people were expected to conform to those roles.  The women of that era sought power not by advancing in rank, but instead by showing the vulnerability of the males of that era either on the examining table to receive an injection, or in a social setting where the men solicit the women's attention.  Once the attack commences, the women wind up in charge because most of them were away from its location and then rushed to the scene, suffering casualties of their own.  Some uneasy questions about whether we were better off then or now with the way things are or were are raised, and the answers are not simple.Once the shock of the attack wore off, and the soldiers began to regroup, the transformation from the military ""working holiday"" that many thought their stations were to an armed force united against a common and deadly enemy was complete.  This movie captured brilliantly both the ferocity and impotence of the attack: a seemingly never-ending assault on our ships is juxtaposed against a cowardly invader retreating the moment we began to fight back.The casting of Dan Ackroyd as a decoder was an excellent detail; no other actor in Hollywood would have done with those few lines he had what he was able to.  ... .Like other recent epics such as ""The Patriot"" or ""Any Given Sunday,"" taking a large slice of Americana and putting it on film to perfection is a hopelessly lost cause. Those who would make the film historically accurate would offer a dull rendition of it, too focused on details and not cognizant of the need to be able to tell a story and make it interesting as a movie, without compromising the facts upon which it is based.This movie achieves these aims on all counts.  A compelling production."	5.0	The defining movie for this event	2002-08-18	9	3	6
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	ANFFNQYRWYPW9	"Rayhawk Corporation ""rayhawk.com"""	Michael Bay is in my opinion a talented director.  With an impressive start with both Bad Boys and The Rock he has proved that he can deliver entertainment that is both commercially and critically well received.Pearl Harbor just plain unfortunate.  To be handed a budget of approximately $135 million (negative costs only) and deliver this product represents a waste of Disney's resources.  Furthermore for this to occur under the helm of veteran blockbuster producer Jerry Bruckheimer is equally surprising.One of Pearl Harbor's central flaws lies in its attempt to do too much.  It seems like the goal here was to emulate what James Cameron had pulled off in Titanic:  Drive a potent love story against the back drop of an epic event.  Sadly enough this goal was unrealized.The characters are transparent and it is hard to empathize with any of the central characters because the core of the story revolves around two best friends basically fighting for the same girl, when either one could have demonstrated nobility in backing off.Lastly, the movie is inaccurate.  The Japanese pilots destroyed almost all American planes that got of the ground, NOT the other way around.Perhaps this large budget mishap is the reason Michael Bay has gone back to the drawing board and is taking on a lower-budget remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as his next endeavor.  I am sure he realizes that proving himself again as a great storyteller instead of a budget buster will restore the studios faith in his apparent talent.	2.0	Michael Bay's worse movie to Date	2002-02-03	9	7	2

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A63WW5UC6KU18	R. Burney	If you haven't yet seen the most anticipated movie of the summer, I suggest you see it simply for the 45 minute attack sequence. It is the most spectacular recreation I have ever seen on film. The film could have easily received an R rating, but it was intended to appeal to a wide audience, so the producer (Bruckheimer) had to cut back on the violence. He did it by easing up on the bloodshed. There isn't much of that, but there IS a good deal of graphic violence in the form of bodies being flung like rag dolls by explosions. There is a scene a la Titanic where rescue boats wade through pools of floating corpses looking for survivors, and more than one occasion where the Japanese strafe pilots running for their planes.The love story that was so widely frowned upon by critics wasn't as awful as I expected it to be. In fact, I thought a couple of the scenes were quite clever, as young Danny (Hartnett) struggles to deal with his feelings for the beautiful Evelyn (Beckinsale). I feared the movie would be nothing but gushy romance until the anticipated attack, but I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent manner in which the movie built itself up to the climax.Acting on the whole is good. Veterans Alec Baldwin, John Voight (who plays a convincing Roosevelt), and Dan Akroyd lend their presence to the screen as always. Newcomer Josh Hartnett has already guaranteed himself roles in future films with this strong performance--he plays a likable character. Beckinsale, a British actress, pulls off the American nurse-in-crisis very well. I was slightly disappointed with Ben Affleck, who at times seemed unemotional in his part.In short, if you're looking for a good, entertaining movie, this is definitely one to see. War buffs might be a bit disappointed, as there is a good deal of romance, but I felt that I got my money's worth.	4.0	Excellent Action, So-So Love	2001-05-29	3	2	1

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1LDIMQISH07WK	Rebecca	Historically accurate + beautiful filmming + so-so script + wonderfully talented actors = PEARL HARBOR - a film to remember and see! Yes, like many others, I think the love story plot of PEARL HARBOR kind of ripped off the love story plot of TITANIC, but the film is still unique in it's own way. This film helps you remember the time during World War II when the Japanese dropped unexpected bombs on US soil in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii (kinda reminds you of the war we're having right now, eh?). It helps you to remember the sacrafices innocent US citizians had to make during that time, as another reviewer pointed out. The love story was supposed to show audiances that this film was not all about the war - but it's central characters revolved around three people. PEARL HARBOR does remind you of TITANIC, but like I mentioned before they are both different. In PEARL HARBOR, a young soldier named Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) goes off to war and finds true love in a young beautiful nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale). Then, he is soon reported dead. And his childhood best friend, Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), falls for Evelyn and they both fall in in love. Later on, Rafe returns and that's when things start heating up between the three. The war and bombing sequences are spectacular and a major thrill ride. If you are into romance, then the love sceens probably won't seem as boring to you. The love sceens to me were pretty good, even though I'm not much of a romantic person. I was able to sit through PEARL HARBOR without moaning and groaning. I actually enjoyed it a lot. The acting is just superb, too from the entire cast. And the film is stunningly historically accurate. If you are into films such as TITANIC and ARMAGEDDON, then I highly recommend PEARL HARBOR to you. And, as a bonus, this DVD is supposed to have some really great special features including the music video of &quot;There You'll Be&quot; by Faith Hill (ooh! How I *love* that song!).

Then the fact that the main female character loves one guy, then his friend, and then back to the original guy just seems kinda tacky especially for something that was set back in the 40's. I'd definitely skip all the character development parts as it was so boring and added nothing to the movie which should've focused more on the actual Pearl Harbor event. When the movie finally gets to it, it becomes more exciting and viable to watch. The special effects during this part are great and definitely top notch. This part is when you actually &quot;feel&quot; for the characters and all the suffering the victims of Pearl Harbor went through. It's definitely not a must see movie if you want a completely watchable movie. Just buy it to watch the Pearl Harbor seen and nothing else which thankfully is pretty long.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1J2931UBBJPXM	Reviewer	"Depicting history on the silver screen is no easy task; critics and historical purists wait in eager anticipation to pounce on a shading that's not quite right or a spent bullet casing that rolls left instead of right in the heat of a battle.  To even consider doing a dramatization of the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor, in this era of endless information and minutiae, is a bold act in itself, and the filmmakers deserve a nod of credit right out of the chute just for attempting it.  And, happily, they deserve still more credit, as ""Pearl Harbor,"" directed by Michael Bay, goes on to successfully capture the pain, pathos, angst, frustration and fear born of that day that ""Will live in infamy.""Told through the lives of two lifelong friends, Captain Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Captain Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), this is a movie of epic proportions presented on a personal level, which enables the audience to connect with the story on an emotional level and not just as an observer of a reenacted historical event.  And when Nurse Lieutenant Evelyn Stewart (Kate Beckinsale) enters the story, it becomes even more involving, and as it builds in intimacy-- juxtaposed against these monumental events as they unfold-- it creates that empathy that really puts the viewer in the picture and gives that sense of total involvement.  This is nothing new to storytelling, of course; writers and movie makers have long understood that when dealing with events that are complex and larger than life, they have to be concentrated and presented from a personal perspective to effect a truly appreciable impact, and as James Cameron proved with ""Titanic,"" there's no better way to do it than with a love story.Without that intimacy between the characters, which is what provides the audience with a frame of reference and a specific element with which the viewer can identify, the impact of all that eventually happens would be significantly diminished.  Like Cameron (and many others before him), Bay recognizes this, and the approach he takes is therefore very effective.  By the time the attack comes, you know and care about the people involved, and it gives the tragedy of that day a personal, rather than just a national or historic perspective.  And though all that follows is visually stunning, it's that personal focus-- that singular involvement that's been so carefully crafted-- that predominates the moment and makes all the difference as far as what you're feeling and experiencing as you watch these horrific and horrendous events play out.Bay is also successful in evoking a true sense of time and place with this film, and he does it not only with authentic settings and visuals, but by giving the film itself a sense of cinematic sensibility that makes it more reminiscent of films like ""Bombardier,"" ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" and ""The Bridges At Toko-Ri,"" than the more recent ""Saving Private Ryan"" (though it does have ""Ryan's"" same level of realism).  It's easy, in fact, to envision this film had it been made fifty or so years ago, with a cast that would've included Dana Andrews, Van Johnson and Gene Tierney as the principals, with Randolph Scott, Pat O'Brien and Eddie Albert in supporting roles.Heading up this cast, Affleck and Hartnett give strong, engaging performances, as does Kate Beckinsale, who successfully manages to take her character to a level beyond that of simply being the romantic interest of the story.  She makes Evelyn believable by responding honestly to the complexities of her character's situation, which in turn adds to the overall credibility of the fictionalized part of the story.  If there's an element in the story at all, in fact, that could be deemed questionable, it may be Rafe's reaction (some may argue, ""over-reaction"") to his personal situation; it is not, however, a reflection on Affleck's ability as an actor-- he gives a satisfying, credible performance-- but merely a subjective evaluation of his character's motivation.Giving memorable performances in supporting roles are Ewen Bremner as Lieutenant Red Winkle, and James King as Nurse Betty.  Also Notable, are Alec Baldwin as Lieutenant colonel Jimmy Doolittle, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Petty Officer Dorie Miller, a Navy cook who rises to the occasion during the attack (though Gooding does bring a bit of melodrama to his portrayal), and especially Jon Voight, who is excellent in the role of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Tom Sizemore, however, as Sergeant Earl Sistern, falls into stereotype, and with the brim of his hat turned up comes across like an actor playing William Bendix playing a role in a war movie more than anything else.  In his defense, though, he does seem to do the best he can with the material he is given, and it is a fairly small part with little time for development.The additional supporting cast includes William Lee Scott (Lieutenant Billy Thompson), Jennifer Garner (Nurse Sandra), Mako (Admiral Yamamoto), Colm Feore (Admiral Kimmel), Leland Orser (Major Jackson), Scott Wilson (General Marshall), Peter Firth (Bennion) and Sara Rue (Nurse Martha).  One more qualified than I will have to comment on the historical ""accuracy"" of the film, but without question, ""Pearl Harbor"" succeeds in conveying the magnitude, scope and significance of the attack, and does it in a way that is emotionally involving and memorable.  It depicts a moment in history that-- regardless of how dark and horrible-- must never be forgotten; and, even as Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" did much to preserve their respective moments in history, so will this film help to insure that December 7, 1941, will forever be remembered."	4.0	That Day Remembered	2002-01-06	4	1	3

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A191ZQLBJ1L3BO	Rhyl Donnelly	I have always enjoyed Jerry Bruckheimer &amp; Michael Bay films, not entirely because of their story lines but their all in good fun. Now they have made Pearl Harbor, a movie not intended to be fun but it is an action movie after all.I personally thought 75% of the movie was good before. Now after seeing the new Director's Cut, I enjoyed pretty much the entire film. Yes the acting could have been a bit better and the story a bit more developped but what can you do? The Director's Cut is only one minute longer than the original, but still, some footage was replaced, some taken out and some new things were added. If you're not a fan of gore you may want to beware of some of the new shots contained in the new action sequence. It's not a substantial amount of blood &amp; guts that may make you cringe, but more of a realistic way of showing what happened. Also, the &quot;Love story&quot; seems to be a bit better paced with little cuts here and there to still keep your eyes on the screen.Even if you did not enjoy the movie, you can learn a lot from this release about the real event and the filmmaking aspect. A lot of work went into this picture and most of it is shown here among its 4 discs! This is so far the best special edition ever released in my opinion in more ways than one.This is a must own for any DVD collector, Pearl Harbor fan, or any aspiring filmmaker. I stronly recommend this Director's Cut.	4.0	A Great DVD for A Decent Movie.	2002-08-19	6	1	5

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	ANZ1UCQE3K8NC	"Richard Blain ""bk007"""	This movie is an excellent example of how Hollywood loves to re-write history. I found this movie so inacurate that it was made painfully unbearable. This movie only tells the angry American post-Pearl view of the attack, and ignores and re-writes most of the facts about the attack. The movie has people getting messages they never received, planes getting shot down that never got shot down, and people dying and coming back from the dead more than they do in comic books. The attack scene was horribly inacurate, and seems to have only been shot so the film makers could throw in some big explosions. The movie makes the Japanese seem like the worst villians to ever exist, and completely ingnores their side of the story. The only things that the film makers got right was the date, and that the Japanese attacked a place called Pearl Harbor. If you like bad fiction you might like this movie, but if you want to see what really happened and see a good movie watch Tora, Tora, Tora!	1.0	Bad fiction, Bad story, Bad acting	2002-09-02	11	8	3

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1TKA9QIZMXQM7	richard seward	After viewing Pearl Harbor on its opening day, I walked away from the theater confused and disappointed. First off, Pearl Harbor was like watching 3 movies in one. The first movie that was played  involved a love triangle between Josh H., Kate B. and Ben A.  This love story intermingled with few action sequences gave a boring start to this major motion picture.  The second movie was the actual battle of Peral Harbor that had awsome and amazing battle scenes, and the third movie was about the doolittle's raid on Tokyo.  For the title to be Pearl Harbor, there certainly was not enough time spent on the actual battle itself.  For starters, the battle did not key in on some of the big faults of both the US and Japan.  They did not mention once about the destruction of an emeny submarine, and did not mention the fact that the United States' four Pacific fleet aircraft carriers were not in the Harbor at the time of the attack. Also, the movie should have ended when the battle was over, the part about the raid on Tokyo should have been left out-possibily for the recreation of other WWII movies. Although the battle scenes were more realistic than those of other movies portreying Japan's attack, I believe that Tora!Tora!Tora! was a much better movie and more historically accurate than Pearl Harbor.	3.0	focused name for an unfocused movie	2001-05-28	5	3	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A38IOX2XJEF5B2	Richard Thompson	&quot;Titanic&quot; took a dramatic event and overlaid a stupid love story (the stupidest since, well, &quot;Love Story&quot;); &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; does the same to the Day of Infamy. For the most part, though, &quot;Titanic&quot; got its history straight. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is loaded with howlers. The ultimate is FDR standing up to get the Doolittle mission approved, but there are others. I had no idea that America had guided missile cruisers in 1941, but there they are being blasted by the Japanese. Nothing took off from Ford Island, but our heros manage to do it anyway. Doolittle didn't take on any fighter jocks for his mission (he had own own cadre of bomber hotshots), but somehow he does here. The list goes on, and that doesn't even count the mistakes on the Japanese side. What did they get right? Well, the Japanese attacked and it was on December 7, 1941. After that, they're kind of shaky.	1.0	Pearl Harbor &quot;Titanic&quot;-ized	2002-07-26	6	3	3

Michael Bay usually falls into two traps with his films: big action montage scenes, and cliched lines. Both are in evidence here, but the big action montage scenes actually do come in handy during the scenes detailing the attack on Pearl Harbor itself. I guess it's one of those times in which a weakness turns out to be a strength under certain circumstances.So, while I wouldn't recommend seeking this film out as a life mission, I wouldn't run away from it, screaming, either.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1MIFU0YKLG40T	Rick Galati	"Anytime a studio saturates the media with endless promotions touting its latest epic, air raid alarms should alert any saavy movie goer to the bombs about to fall. This film is to Pearl Harbor what Falcon Crest was to wine. Two and one half hours of boilerplate love triangle tedium cannot be offset by 30 minutes of special effects calculated to pump some excitement into the veins that Kate,Ben,and Josh just couldn't muster. Computer regurgitations of unlikely aircraft maneuvers are as realistic as they are phony. If that sounds conflicted, blame it on the story line. If only the Japanese would have telegraphed their intentions as clearly as the writers of Mr. Affleck's characters' destiny, Pearl Harbor would have had more than ample time to prepare a much warmer welcome. But I gotta hand it to the studio machine. They were clever enough to trot out (with much fanfare) aging WW2 veterans for the world premier. No reports as to how many of the true survivors of Pearl Harbor fell asleep while enduring this debacle. If you are more than mildly interested in some of the events surrounding Dec 7, 1941, a much better film has long been released.

The story is not immediately shoot and run. It is tied up in the romance triangle that gets confused and highly entertaining to watch throughout the movie. Another great thing is the length. The movie doesn't finish after you watch the harbor get blown up. There's also another mission that displays the revenge America takes against Japan. The movie may seem like a slow romance, and it may seem to others like a mindless action movie. Guess what! It's both!

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A125R9Q12L2EKL	RJ	First, there was &quot;Independence Day.&quot;  Then, there was &quot;The Patriot.&quot;  This summer, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is Hollywood's patriotic offering.  In all three, the USA is an underdog, caught unawares and overwhelmed, but comes out on top in the final reel.  I would have much rather the action sequences (read: the attack on Pearl Harbor) to have been in &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; and allow the love story to be a separate film.  Every character, other than the three leads, was very one- dimensional and, unless you are attracted to love stories as a background to a war film, the only thing to recommend this film is the actual attack sequences, including those involving the leads.  The techniques used in filming owe a lot to &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Titanic,&quot;  but are used to great effect here, from the death of the &quot;Oklahoma&quot; to the aftermath scenes.  The effects in the hospital sequences evoke very well in the filmgoer the feeling of the panic and adrenaline during a disaster situation.  So overall, if you are an action buff, you have to wade through a lot of plot in the beginning, but the action is worth waiting for, and there is a little heart-tugging there that you should allow yourself to experience.  And if you don't mind Jon Voight, Dan Ackeroyd, and others to be put in cameos and then under-used, you won't mind their appearing in the film.	3.0	Another Patriotic Summer	2001-06-01	1	0	1

None have done it better. Tora Tora Tora is better for historical fact, but this movie puts you in the attack. Love story aside, this movie captures the essence of the times and of the attack. You feel the emotion of what has just happened. Don't miss out on a great movie because of the secondary story of the love affair. If all possible see this movie on a large widescreen TV with surround sound. The DVD has DTS sound. I swore bullets were flying by me. They filmed this at Pearl! right at the spots where this whole thing took place. They took bits of the stories from the men and women that were there and put them into the film. For the little bit of historical fact that was not right, like Dan Akaroyed's part in the film; it is overshadowed by the real stories and information that was put in the film. The negative thing about this movie is the lead actors Ben Affleck,Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale. They were good, but needed to be stronger. Now Alec Baldwin who is a great actor anyway was fantastic. A great movie! Great special features on the DVD.	4.0	A MUST HAVE FOR ALL WAR MOVIE FANS	2007-02-10	6	3	3

The love story was cheezy and extremely predictable and reminded me of Castaway and about a 100 other movies. If this is the movie of the summer I might have to stop watching movies because i was thoroughly disgusted. This movie, like so many other war movies, is extremely ahistorical. Pearl Harbor portrays the Japanese way too softly, as if they were just noble people defending their homeland, while in fact they committed atrocities in China that were worse than the Nazis. This is what Hollywood produces, and I guess its what people want, but if you have any intelligence whatsoever you'll recognize this as yet another piece of trashy, predictable, lame filmmaking.	1.0	Another Piece of Trash from of Hollywood	2001-06-20	3	2	1

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1K6GPXW844D4I	Robert D. Conner	Lacking any kind of character development, this film falls far short of the bar set by other recent WWII movies, like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Both Raf (Affleck) and Danny (Harnett) waltz through the film without any change in their demeanor, remaining young cocksure pilots, untouched by the events surrounding them. The enemy here is faceless and politically correct while death is Disney-fied and sterile. Also, strangely absent is the character's racial hatred of the Japanese, characteristic of the period. Micheal Bay's strong point has always been his fast and innovative cinematography, but it alone cannot fill the gap left by a sub par script. Like Titanic, this film is good for one thing only, visual effects. Written by the screenwriter of BRAVEHEART, another film with more good press than actual substance, the only reason PEARL HARBOR should be purchased by anyone is ILM's fantastic special effects work. The attack sequence alone is well worth the price of the DVD. And the great thing about DVD? You don't have to fast forward to the good part.	2.0	A Film That Will Live in Infanmy	2001-08-27	24	18	6

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3GRU9732S4V1U	"Robert Jenkins ""video geek #1"""	I went into the theater to see this film fully aware that the majority of the film focused on romance, not the Pearl Harbor attack.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find a LOT more action than I expected.  The sequence where Rafe is fighting in England as part of the Eagle Squadron is a very well done depiction of the desperate struggles of the RAF against the Luftwaffe.  This sequence is an overlooked high spot in the film.  I was also very happy with the sequence regarding the training for the Doolittle Raid and the raid itself.  As for the romantic triangle between Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsdale, well, it was pretty predictable, but it did do a great job of making us care about them and their friends.  Ironically, the character I enjoyed the most, Cuba Gooding Jr., was almost totally ignored.  I thought the film missed an opportunity by not spending more time on him and his friend who was killed aboard USS Arizona.Having said all this, I did have a few problems with the depiction of the actual attack itself.  Mostly, though, they are things that I wish they would have shown but didn't, since I am a WW2 buff and am very familiar with the actual events.  I have to wonder, though, why they showed such excellent imagery of the USS Oklahoma capsizing and the explosion of USS Arizona, but left in all the modern warships that are seen throughout the attack.  There were also a lot of bits, especially the toppling mainmast of a battleship, that were not historically accurate, but seemed thrown in just to provide a few more explosions.  I also think the film missed an opportunity by not showing the attempt by USS Nevada to escape the harbor, and her subsequent attacking and beaching.  That would have been a great action sequence and a stirring moment, much as the actual event was.Perhaps the movie's strongest scenes were the ones dealing with the responses of medical personnel to the flood of injured victims and the attempts to save trapped and drowning sailors.  Using Coke bottles to collect donated blood, use of lipstick to identify those who could and could not be saved, the general chaos, the helplesness of rescuers as their comrades drown before their very eyes - very powerful stuff.I thought this movie was a great action/romance, if not strictly true to history.  But, for those of us who insist on historical fidelity, there is always Tora, Tora, Tora!	4.0	Good romance, GREAT action...	2002-01-07	3	1	2

The romance sequences soften the brutalties of war of which this film captures the moment,  as vividly as &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.

What a major disappointment!  Even great special effects could not make up for major historical inaccuracies and a sub-par romantic plot that stretched the limits of believability!  For example, how come Rafe was flying with the RAF against German daylight raids which actually stopped months before he arrived in England?  And what happened to Evelyn, who was pregnant at the time of Pearl Harbour raid in December, and looked like Twiggy a few months later when Rafe brings Danny's body back from China!  This movie was way too long and at times I felt like dozing off!  Forget this one and instead go buy Tora! Tora! Tora!

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3H9JSM1SUTE4O	Robin Simmons	To coincide with the 6oth anniversary of the sneak Japanese attack against American assets, the Disney machine releases the two-disc &quot;PEARL HARBOR&quot; (Touchstone), it's gargantuan recreation of the horrific incident that sealed our involvement in WW II.Set against a sophomoric and predictable love triangle (Ben Afflect, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsdale), the stunning CGI enhanced invasion and the heartstopping flying sequences are all the more impressive. The Disney team had high hopes of duplicating the success of &quot;Titanic&quot; with what they thought were the same key ingredients but on an even larger scale. But alas, the critics and public did not respond in kind.What made &quot;Titanic&quot; so universally popular had to do with the idea of seeking love in a perfect world that suddenly is doomed. Is there something in our collective subconscious that  understands that? After all, our time here is brief at best. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; does not connect on that delicate, spiritual level but certainly delivers the action. The magnificent looking film on this double disc set is artistically packaged in faux worn leather binder and is further wrapped in self importance with a great History Channel documentary &quot;Unsung Heroes&quot; and a fine making of supplement. Disney will further exploit the vulnerable DVD collector when it releases the definitive director's cut next May. That one will have Michael Bay's commentary.

I tend to think of Michael Bay as the hell-spawned crack baby of Tony Scott and Renny Harlin, having all of the slick visual tricks of his parents, but none of the substance that might occasionally seep into their movies. ""Armageddon"" was ""Top Gun"" for the 90s. And I'm a Ben Affleck fan. When I rented this movie, I found it was no different from Bay's others: loud, flashy, and vacuous. But during the middle hour, the damndest thing happened: I actually became glued to my seat. This was no doubt due to the outstanding attack scenes, and the hardships of the young men in the Arizona. And to think, it only took the gross national product of a small country to recreate the real-life horrors that the survivors have been trying forever to forget. However much Bay wanted people to think that this was a memorial to the heroes of World War, I doubt that he added all that glitz and glamour for a more realistic portrayal as much as I doubt that Roland Emmerich made ""Godzilla"" to show the plight of all lizards."	3.0	Ugghhh.	2002-01-28	0	0	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A25IZ19JQN4QL0	rocky petralia	"Director Michael Bay breathes much needed new life into the war movie genre by making ""Pearl Harbor"" a crowd-pleasing musical in the tradition of the great MGM extravaganzas of the forties and fifties. Bay introduces colorful song and dance numbers into the Sunday morning tussle that welcomed America into WWII, and thereby turns what would otherwise be a pedantic history lesson into a popcorn-munching good time.The film opens with the performance of the jaunty ""Rots of Bombs"". The Japanese pilots are quietly performing pre-attack calisthenics on the deck of a carrier when Admiral Yamamoto (Akio Mikuni) appears and begins a spirited, samba-tinged call and response. Jumping jacks turn into rumba dancing as Yamamoto sings out questions and the pilots merrily reply: ""Who has bombs?/We have bombs/How many bombs?/Rots of bombs.""Back in Oahu, American pilots Dex and Dewey (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett)share the affection of nurse Rhonda (Kate Beckinsale). The three are tangled in the afterglow of a night of tropical lovemaking when the attack begins. As they drive their jeep to the airfield, Affleck and Hartnett show off heretofore unheard vocal talent when they sing the haunting ballad ""Snuggle Time"", which includes: ""When we kissed our baby bye-bye/We tasted last night's mai-tai./Now we've lost our morning mojo/Thanks to Admiral Tojo./We should be sandwiching our baby /But they're torpedoing our navy./There is no bigger crime/Than missing snuggle time.""The only misstep in ""Pearl Harbor"" is an ill-conceived hip-hop tune by Alec Baldwin as Lt. Jimmy Doolittle. Leading his squadron on a reprisal bombing of Japan, Baldwin flips his fighter cap around backwards and begins rapping: ""Whacha bomb my homies for/It's disrespectful, doncha know?/Now I gotta even up the score/And jack some pain on Tokyo."" It seems disingenuous that onboard the bombers are coolers of malt liquor.Otherwise, ""Pearl Harbor"" combines the magic of Hollywood with the mirth of war. The seamless merging of rousing show tunes with exploding flight decks will leave you feeling proud and prickly.

Dorie Miller: He was the first significant hero, but very there was very little coverage of him in the movie. Some of the coverage was unrealistic since the navy was segregated at the time.2. Japanese: There should have been more coverage about the Japanese in this picture, since they are a major part of this historical episode.3. Roosevelt: There was no coverage of his policy decisions such as the embargo against Japan.The plus is that the movie refreshed many people about this tragedy and why the sacrifices of these men must be remembered.	4.0	Good but missing many elements	2002-10-16	0	0	0

And even with a 200 million dollar budget they were unable to recreate 1940s warships. Ever wondered why they show the Japanese carrier battle group only for about one second at a time? Because it's a modern U.S. carrier. All the ships in Pearl Harbor (during the overflight scene) are clearly modern, and even for the explosions they used only scarcely camouflaged Spruance class destroyers from the 1970 and Knox class frigates from the 1960s.Combine these horrible and unforgivable anachronisms with ridicolously bad acting, a totally unbelievable and inaccurate story, and so many slow motion shots that it makes you sick and you get a cinematic disaster.	1.0	Don't buy this one	2002-02-04	6	5	1

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"One can only speculate about how great a part timing plays in determining whether or not any particular film is a success or failure at the box office.  I suspect that had ""Pearl Harbor"" been released three or four months later than it was - in say September rather than June of 2001 - it might have been able to ride the wave of renewed American patriotism that accompanied that other Day of Infamy, the September 11th terrorist attacks - and found itself some true financial glory.  As it is, the film will probably now enjoy a more lucrative life in its home video incarnation than it might otherwise have done under more normal circumstances.  So I guess, in some ways, the film's timing ends up being fortuitous after all.Even from the start, one could see that ""Pearl Harbor"" was designed as a bald-faced attempt to replicate the unprecedented success of ""Titanic.""  One is only amazed at how completely it fails.  In both films a simplistic love story has been grafted onto an historic event of monumental tragedy, one that is familiar to the audience beforehand, comes mostly at the end, and offers scads of special effects wizards gainful employment in bringing the episode to life on the screen.  In many ways, ""Pearl Harbor"" is simply the biggest, loudest and costliest example of that strange hybrid genre known as the ""chick flick/war movie.""  (In this way, I guess filmmakers feel they have the whole date-night crowd covered).  Somehow, one expects to find romance on a cruise ship.  It feels right there.  A romantic story seems somehow less apropos as the foundation for a film on this particular subject.  In fact, the love triangle scenario that makes up fully the first half of this film's enormous three-hour running time is of such surpassing banality that one begins to wonder if anyone bothered to read the script before the actors were pushed out in front of the cameras.  For it is quite obvious that all the creative minds engaged in bringing this film to completion were focused far more on the massive reconstructed sets, elaborate explosions and jaw dropping special effects than on anything so simple and banal as character development or thematic depth.It would be hard to imagine three less interesting characters than Rafe (catch the All-American hero name yet!), Danny and Evelyn to serve as the focal point for a film on this important a subject.  The first two (played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) are childhood buddies, now turned bomber pilots, who happen to fall in love with the same beautiful nurse (played by Kate Beckinsale).  Just think back to the complex characters at the core of ""From Here to Eternity.""  In that film, so absorbing and grand were those figures and the situations in which they found themselves that the Pearl Harbor attack actually stayed, for the most part, in the background.  In ""Pearl Harbor,"" we are never allowed to forget that the sole purpose for the movie's existence is the attack sequence.  Every moment of the first half is painful to watch - from the awkward and silly first meetings, to the sappy and drippy love scenes, to the inevitable fistfight between the two best friends just hours before they will be called upon to demonstrate brotherhood in action for a greater cause.  Rick, the main character in ""Casablanca,"" uttered the famous truism that the travails of three insignificant people don't ""amount to a hill of beans"" in the face of events of global importance - and that philosophy has never seemed more on the money than in the case of ""Pearl Harbor.""  But then when you are fretting over making back those untold millions you've lavished on your star-studded production, you don't dare allow yourself to entertain such subversive thoughts.  I hate to have to say this but the pasteboard love story that weakly props up ""Pearl Harbor"" ends up being an insult to both those who survived and those who perished in the holocaust.What is NOT an insult to their memories, however, is the attack sequence itself.  Here the wretched movie almost redeems itself, for not only is this scene breathtakingly realized in its complexity and scope, but it also captures the poignancy of the devastation in amazingly graphic terms. The gruesomeness of much of the death and carnage put before us makes us fully appreciate, for the first time I think, the enormity of the horror and suffering that accompanied that event.  ""Pearl Harbor"" justifies its brilliant excesses by bringing this moment to epic life for a whole generation who has heretofore probably encountered it only as a highlighted study note in some dry high school or college textbook.  For a glorious half hour or so, the filmmakers husband all the resources of modern special effects to plunge us into an epochal moment in our nation's history.  Herr, indeed, is technological excess employed in a salutary purpose.The advantage in seeing ""Pearl Harbor"" on video rather than in the theatre is that, in the latter venue, one could only snooze through the torpid first half and wake refreshed when the bombs started dropping and the guns firing.  Now, with the power of the remote in one's hand, one can simply fast forward to all the good parts and leave the sappy ones behind."	2.0	great action sequences; dreadful story	2002-01-02	1	1	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2GEB05H8G2Z5A	Rolltide	I saw this film at a mall theatre in the philippines which is most fiting because that country was raped and pillaged by the japanese in the war. Not that historical accuracy means anything in this movie. &quot;Pearl harbor&quot; represents commericalism at it's very worst. Nothing wrong with making a buck but this movie was made and edited in such a way to not offend anybody and great art almost always offends somebody. They didn't want the film to be too patriotic so it wouldn't turn off non americans. They didn't want to portray the japanese too harshly because they wanted the movie to sell there. There had to be a really stupid sappy love story to appeal to the teeny bobbers the way titanic did. So much effort was placed in this movie to appeal the the maximum number of people that nothing is left of redeeming value. Why bother to watch a movie about this most important historical event that cares little for history or patriotism? But they did manage to offend some people. Veterans of world war two and most veteran groups find this film offensive and many recommend that the movie be boycotted. I agree.Now even a misguided movie like this can provide some entertainment. Mississippi burning was a similarly misguided movie but it had some value because of the classic good v evil story line and a great performance by gene hackman. That's not the case here. Both leading men are terribly unconvincing and ben affleck's rafe(rafe?) was comletely dull. Kate beckinsale gives the best performance considering how shallow her character is written. Fact is the writing for the whole film is pathetic. The love story is dumber than dumb as beckinsale's squeeze rafe, gets shot down in europe and is presumed dead. Naturally ben's best buddy(played by josh hannah) moves in and knocks up beckinsdale just before our hunky leading man shows up not so dead after all. And we're supposed to care? Don't worry though because this moronic love story only consumes 2 hours of the movie. That's all.Then we get to that little incidental event of the japanese attack. The action portrayed isn't bad and you can't help but be relieved to see the story move in another direction. Our two studly heros forget about their tense romantic conflict just long enough to hop in a couple of planes and kick some butt while beckinsale and her babe nurse cohorts save lives below. It's all so exciting. When the dust clears 3000 americans are dead but you won't be moved because of the plastic video game presentation.Now apparently mr. bay et al fiqured the movie was lacking at this point so they decided on depicting dolittle's raid on tokyo. Dolittle is depicted by that great patriot himself alec baldwin whose performance isn't too bad. Again history is a little fuzzy here but it provides our heroic leading men an opportunity to be, well, heroic. Unfortunately the josh harnett character doesn't survive the attack and we are supposed to feel sad. Don't worry you won't. Great movies make you feel something. The only thing you will feel from watching this movie is that you wish you didn't waste your hard earned money on it. Titanic was the main blue print for this film. Take a love story and entwine it with a real life tragedy. Titanic suceeded because there were some real gut wrenching moments. Not in &quot;pearl harbor&quot;. As for beckindale and afflecks romance? Well they get back together of course. And Ben, rafe,(rafe?) agrees to raise his buddy's kid. Why should anyone care?Finally there is one good thing about this film.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1L28BHCWPVKDA	Ronald	"Wow...how can I even begin to describe this.  I'll tell you the truth, when I first went to see this movie (Pearl Harbor) in theaters, I was a little dissapointed.  It seemed a little too corny (like someone mentioned).  I mean the dialogue  was past the brink of being terrible.  Plus, it was too long for my taste. However, the scenery and battle scenes were excellent.  Probably the best things in the movie were the battle scenes.I was a little hesitant on buying this DVD, but my wife begged me to, so I went ahead and bought it.  I figured, hey, she can watch it, I don't have to.  However, I ended up watching it myself (out of curiousity).First of all, let me comment on the DVD itself. Hard work really went into making this DVD enjoyable. For a DVD, Pearl Harbor is put remarkably well. Even the main menu screen is something to be praised. The picture quality was so crisp, I'm thinking it was probably even better than the theatrical showing.  The sound was awesome!!  When the bombings occured, I found myself actually wincing because the sound was SO real! I was there shaking my head in horror at all the realistic attacks. There is a ton of REAL historical footage on this DVD also.  It comes well equipped with 2 disks.  One disk contains the bonus material.  I didn't think I would like it, but when I watched the ""making of the movie"", I really came to realize just how much hard work and effort came into making this movie.  I hate to admit it, but I actually feel that Micheal Bay was at least TRYING to be historically accurate with telling the story (...) and re-living that eventful day which we know as Dec. 7th, 1941.All in all, not only did the DVD come with the making of the movie, but also a History channel documentary of the REAL unsung heroes of this war.  I thought that was very interesting.  It was touching to see these real survivors explain what happend in thier own words. Many of them became very emotional getting flash backs to that horrible scene.  I think I've had a change of opinion since our OWN recent attack on the United States on September 11th.  It made me look at this film a bit differently.  In conclusion, I think this movie Pearl Harbor, did what it was basically supposed to do.  Which is make people remember PEARL HARBOR.  It gave people sort of a glimpse into what the attacks may have looked like 60 years ago. (I'm sure the REAL attack was even worse than what we saw in this film.)  In that sense, I think this movie succeeded.Even haters of this movie will most likely find the bonus material very interesting, and even very good.  The movie was actually bearable this time around.  Even the veterans found this movie enjoyable.So, basically my advice, even if you don't buy this DVD, atleast go and rent it.  I think it's well worth it."	5.0	Total surprise! The movie...eh... but the DVD....Great!!!	2001-12-07	1	0	1

To take one of the most tragic days in American history and distill it down to a tepid romance is shameful. Just because a film is 3hrs. plus doesn't make it a epic and the miscalculation to spend the first third of the movie away from Hawaii is just bad storytelling. Why not begin with the men on the ships and get to know some real characters that we actually care about instead of some cheesy 3way love triangle, that way when the terrible attack occurs we feel real sympathy for the men instead of blasting us with mind numbing sound and effects. This could have been a great film about a important day if Spielberg or Cameron had done it.

Not only did this movie enlighten me to new facts about that time period that I never knew about and weren't in any of my history books, but the story of a woman torn between her feelings for two different men who just happen to be best friends unfolded just beautifully throughout the whole thing.  I found myself wondering what I would have done, who I would have chose, how I would have handled that situation.  Think of the time they were living in!  It was a perfect love story incorporated into a real life tragedy like Pearl Harbor.  The reality of this film was almost incomprehensible.  I bet this sort of thing happened to a lot of people during this time period, and any other period of time when we were at war.  P.S.

I love all the effects that make this movie come to life.  As a matter of fact, I wish i was on the set myself helping them film this movie.  The Attack scene was really Intense, and realistic.  The love story that has to go withen the movie was not very believable though.  I think it would have had a greater effect if Eveylen would have felt deeper feelings for both guys.

ENTERTAINMENT! If you want 100% historically accurate, go watch a documentary on the history channel.For the most part, this movie is accurate. Sure, there might be some small details that are not perfect, but as a whole, it does a very good job of showing us what it was like on Dec 7th 1941 at Pearl Harbor.Some people also seem to expect and hope for extremely graphic, bloody, and gory scenes like Saving Private Ryan. Anyone with a brain has a pretty good idea what warfare can do to the fragile human body. The people in the movie were still dying. I personally didn't miss or need extremely graphic images to get the point across.The love story side of it... Ok, so what? I thought it was done well enough. Certainly at least as watchable as the love story in Titanic.I thought all the acting was quite good, especially John Voight as F.D.R.I think a lot of people haven't even seen this movie due to some of the lousy reviews it's received. Also, the rhetoric from people that may not have even seen the film certainly seems to influence many. See it for yourself and make up your own mind!	5.0	Quality Film	2003-05-05	4	2	2

Hollywood needs to get rid of all of the cheesy special effects with lame headache explosions of bombs in this movie and plainly just make up a story with good scripts.

Penola	Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer hit you over the head with their films, and this movie is no exception.  However, do not believe all of the hateful reviews you may have read in the [news]papers -- this movie definitely holds your attention, even though it is a glossy Hollywood piece of fantasy.  Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsdale hold their own as glossy movie stars, while Ben Allfeck once again delivers a wooden, paper-thin performance with no heart.  The love story, set up like a carbon copy of Titanic, does not pull you in with the same emotion as that similar fictional story set against a true historical event -- but the battle scenes, which roar on for nearly 40 minutes, are exciting and well-shot.  Without the emotional lift, sadly, the tragedy of Pearl Harbor does not resonate with the kind of power it might have in other hands.	2.0	EMPTY-HEADED BUT ENGROSSING	2001-05-28	4	2	2

The historical characters (FDR, Doolittle and Hirohito, etc.) were as shallow as the fictional heroes created to make the story more 'interesting.'I've enjoyed Bruckheimer/Bay movies in the past. Armageddon was a lot of fun, and The Rock was astounding. But to pretend to make a serious film out of one of this country's most devastating days, and to then ignore every shred of factual, historical detail in the process is an utter blasphemy.I beg of you; please DON'T BUY THIS DVD. To do so would only encourage the lousy, shallow and worthless artificial art that these men pass off as filmmaking.If you really want to know what happened at Pearl Harbor (and why), read a book. If instead, you just need something flashy to pass a few otherwise useful hours watching, then this DVD might be for you. Anyone else would be wasting their time.

It was a love story set in Pearl Harbor, first of all. They name the movie after an event where thousands were murdered ... and then make it a love story that has nothing to do with pearl harbor. The fighting itself was toned down to the point of being a joke. There is very little blood, no true to life horror, what is this supposed to make us believe about war??? It belittled the Japanese ... I can promise you the Japanese didn't come up with the idea of attacking by plane because of children flying kites ... and their strategic maps weren't little floating boats in a garden pond. They planned it for months. This movie is filled with sappy romantic and patrotic gesture which can't be applied to such a horrible event ... and I don't believe the movie even suggests the nuclear bombing of two major cities in retaliation, although it does go deeply into &quot;military retaliation.&quot; I give this movie two stars because I respect them for trying.	2.0	a new sappy live story ruins a solemn event	2001-10-13	3	2	1

And they really stretched that ""two men love the same woman, and one woman loves those two men"" schlock throughout the whole 3 hour movie.  If it wasn't for the cool 40 minute Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in the middle of the film, I'd never watch this again.One funny note: The Japanese Commander chose to attack innocent people (we americans) who had no interest in participating in the war, and with all that killing of innocent people, they called it a means of ""honor"". I guess, to them, shooting somebody in the back to avoid equaled confrontation must be a means of ""honor"" too.It is interesting though that Dan Ackroyd was in this film.  He was in the 1979 John Landis comedy ""1941"".  Now that's a World War II movie of the Japanese attacking an american beach that is worthy of watching again and again.  I wish they would release that movie onto Blu-Ray because it has alot a cool visuals of WWII airplanes and various familiar comic actors and actresses.Anyway, Pearl Harbor has it's moments, but I doubt I'd ever watch it again unless I had some female company that forced me to sit down with them and watch it again.

Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, Alec Baldwin, and Cuba Gooding Jr. all did very well.  The movie was a little slow at times.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A32XW50ILWOXNO	Samuel McKewon	So there's a script for &quot;Pearl Harbor.&quot; It's bad. How bad? Imagine a dog writing it.Actually, Randall Wallace penned it. He wrote &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;The Patriot.&quot; These were not awful films, though neither were particularly accurate on the history front. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is more accurate, but it's like a mini-outline with a poorly conceived love triangle in the middle.I've seen many 1940s movies, where actors fired off lines of wit and verve with the same energy. What is the assembled acting clan supposed to do with what passes for dialogue in this film? I don't know. Believe me, they didn't either.At the centerpiece of this three-hour clambake is a 40-minute invasion sequence, where Japanese planes descend upon battleships and airfields at the Hawaiian naval base. The director, Michael Bay, of many other loud, brogue action films, has made this sequence equally loud, and things blow up over and over as planes zoom, as they must, through the same mangled set of ship wreckage and ominous flotsam.How disappointing this melee of fireworks is. It's redundant for one, the action clearly dialed down to achieve a PG-13 rating. And though it's meant to be the payoff, of course it isn't, because we can barely understand the Japanese motives or strategy behind the attack, nor do we care to see Americans blown up continuously, in the exact same fashion as the last scene.Consider &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; for a second. Infinitely better film, but infinitely better in styling its combat scenes - it has a progression, for example, and innovation in terms of camera angles and point of view shots. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; steals all the choice shots from &quot;Ryan&quot; (the underwater cameras with bullets streaming by) and cuts at such a furious rate that the action becomes nonsensical.It is for this sequence that you're watching the film at all. That it doesn't deliver is reason for disappointment. Then you must consider what is around it - a story of supreme cliche and weariness, as born pilot Rafe (Ben Affleck) falls for nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) before volunteering to fly for the British Air Force against the German Luftwaffe. He leaves behind Evelyn and best friend Danny (Josh Hartnett), also a pilot.Rafe dies in action. The nurse and best friend get transferred to Pearl Harbor. Nurse and best friend spark relationship. Rafe returns (He was in occupied France! He couldn't get word! And all he thought of was Evelyn!). Anger and betrayal ensue, with more bad dialogue. The next day, they all live in infamy.We're with these simpering flakes and their romantic overtures for 90 minutes before bombs fly. This is an attempt to steal the top off another film, &quot;Titanic,&quot; which set forth a reasonable love story of some interest before iceberg, straight ahead.But Wallace, said screenwriter, whiffs. One cliche, or two, fine. But when there's a lone Irish pilot in the film, when he has red hair and wee mustache, when he speaks in a thick Irish stew accent, and when his name is Ian, the line I must draw.Bay hides his lack of storytelling skills by using the Jelly Belly palette of colors. I don't care if he can make a sky look nine different shades of aquamarine. How about not backlighting all scenes as if its showtime at the dinner theater? Or stopping the camera? Or refraining from the use of music better suited for &quot;Rocky IV&quot; in scenes that involve the Japanese?And, of course, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; ends dramatically upbeat, with the United States' pinkerton response over Tokyo on April 3, 1942, led by Captain Doolittle (a glistening Alec Baldwin) and his Raiders, of which Danny and Rafe are a part.It concludes with a speech of great overstatement by Evelyn that suggests after Doolittle's raid: &quot;Japan knew nothing but defeat. And the United States knew but victory.&quot;That's just the kind of history &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; chooses to serve up: that the U.S. then went on to pummel Japan at will for three years in the Pacific before dropping a couple atomic bombs in 1945 as a sundae cherry. Sure. And bats can see.&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is an unmitigated insult to the day and the place. The romance is pitched at an eighth-grade level, so the teens might like it, but I cringe at them thinking they've learned history here.	2.0	Lousy script, repetitive action..an insult to the real place	2003-10-14	4	3	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A4LU68MXFUEM1	Santiago Foolish	This movie was an hour longer than it should have been.  Combining stale, overused cliches snatched from every possible story in Hollywood, Pearl Harbor plods through its first two thirds, introducing a nicely pat romance and a conviniently unrealistic love triangle before we can finish dozing off.  After it gets going, it manages to come off as insincere and manipulative as it throws scenes stolen from other movies at us one after the other, culminating with the award-winning Cuba Gooding Jr. getting a bit part to play the role of the heroic black man, quickly becoming a sad cliche.  True, the battle scenes were fairly well done, which accounts for the extra star.  But even after sitting through two hours of a cheap Titantic remake, when the flag was finally raised and the movie started hitting its stride, I came out not having gone through anything profound--compare this overblown monstrosity to Black Hawk Down, for instance, which managed to give tribute without being pedantic.  It saddens me, especially in light of recent events, that this was all they could pull off.  Pearl Harbor deserves better.	2.0	Three Hours For This?	2002-02-20	3	3	0

Instead, it is a story of love and friendship set during the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Actions, beliefs, and lifestyles all reflect the era and the historical information.  Veterans shared their stories to help everyone involved with the movie understand the emotion and occurrences of that day.  I loved this movie because I realized that.  I went in expecting to see a love story and a tragedy.  I also did get a better idea of what happened that day, from both sides of the attack.  Men and women died protecting our country and I felt that this movie did honor them and increased the awareness about the even that sent us into WWII.  There wasn't a dry eye in the theatre and this included some manly men.  The emotions you feel in regards to not only the romance, but the attack as well are unbelievably powerful.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2RQ0APVSQ25G2	Sarah	"'Pearl Harbor', released in 2001 is a tale spun around the events that formed Pearl Harbor. It centers around two childhood friends, Rafe McCrawley and Danny Walker, who join the army as pilots to fulfill their childhood dreams of flying. Rafe meets the lovely Evelyn shortly before he applies for a transfer to the RAF to fly out and battle the Germans over London. Danny and Evelyn, meanwhile are both transferred to Pearl Harbor in the summer of 1941. The news of Rafe's death in England stuns them both and in their grief, they turn to each other for help and support. But when Rafe turns up alive, both of them must face conflicting emotions which are interrupted as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor occurs December 7th, 1941.The story is a hopeless romance, but in reality, has little to do with the actual Pearl Harbor. Historical accuracy is so-so. The names of most of the nurses are accurate, but Rafe and Danny are obsolete to the time. ""Dorie"" Miller was a real character, but his family history and background have been added for effect. The actions of Rafe and Danny during the attack are clearly based on the real life actions of pilots Ken Taylor and George Welch; it is possible that Red's personality is also based on a real life character. The RAF, as far as I can tell, actually existed, so it is possible that Rafe might have been transferred there. But the color of the Japanese planes that attacked Pearl Harbor were silver with red suns, not green, and the idea that a fighter pilot might somehow get put in a mission with a bunch of bombers is somewhat ridiculous. Marital relations before actual marriage were considered preposterous at the time. Two other things to consider concerning the 40's is #1 everyone smoked and all the time, and #2 it appears that practically everyone had a nickname aside from their regular name.In short, the movie really has no merit to being called ""Pearl Harbor"". Only one hour of the three hour movie is dedicated to the actual attack, the rest is fluff. Aside from the actual battle, the story trends toward boring and monotonous. Real characters are never quite fully developed, real life problems fail to be dealt with, and many of the lines could be called corny. If you want to really understand Pearl Harbor, I recommend you check out Tora! Tora! Tora! Despite the fact that the special effects are somewhat lacking compared to today's standards, they were impressive in their day when the movie was made. More importantly, it brings to light a real, more truthful understanding of the day and place without the added styrofoam. If you are admittedly a romantic, then you would probably be better off with the book by Randall Wallace. The movie is basically the novel with the good parts taken out."	1.0	Think again	2004-07-23	10	5	5

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1S0KUH8L43MKN	Sarah Quigley	This was the absolute, most terrible movie I've ever seen.  It was historically inaccurate and filled with every romantic-drama cliche there is.  If Michael Bay wanted to make a romance, he could left history out of it.  I think the event of Pearl Harbor itself is quite dramatic enough for a film, without having to add sex and betrayal. The saddest part is that people are actually going to watch this movie think that FDR actually drew attention to his disability so blatantly, when in fact he never would have done anything like struggle to his feet that way.  And no one died on the Doolittle Raid.  Only Kamakaze pilots wore the rising sun head bands and they weren't used until 1944.  And turning the struggle that followed the attack into a game of chicken?  The utter disrespect for the people who suffered through Pearl Harbor is abhorent and I cannot believe that more people do not feel this way.	1.0	History Perverted by Hollywood	2001-12-16	4	3	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2SUOY3YZPWTQR	Sarah Sullivan	This has got to be absolutely one of the best movies ever made in my own opinion! When I first saw the trailer for the movie, I figured it was just going to be another war movie... but I was way off! Well... of course it is a war movie but it also has a very interesting love story too! For some reason... critics said that the love story totally ruined the movie... I absolutely disagree 100%! That love story kept my eyes glued to the screen! I loved this movie because it made you laugh and cry at the same time and I don't think my eyes went off the screen once! This movie just mesmerizes you the moment you start watching! I don't think this was just another typical war movie because you got to really know the characters on a personal basis and when something happened to them... you really cared and felt like you were losing your own loved one in a way! The actual bombing scene was spectacular! They had awesome visual effects... it really felt like it was happening right before your very eyes! The cast was excellent... I was always a Josh Hartnett fan so that was one of the main reasons I went... and am I glad that I did! Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale did spectacular also! After seeing this movie, I got really interested in researching wars... in particular World War II! I think this movie really raised people's awareness of what really happened in American History! I also think that it raised people's patriotism too... and that's especially important with all that is happening ever since September 11th! So please... if you are considering buying the video... please do! I know for a fact that you won't regret it!	5.0	Absolutely Brilliant Film!	2001-10-28	4	3	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2AJKKMCCY5U0W	Sara Rangel	"Although Pearl Harbor was said by many to be somewhat of a waste of time and was ""discracefully"" unrealistic compared to the actual event, viewers must remember that it is Hollywood. Movies are made to entertain. Love stories and romance sell. The director, cast and crew are cashing in and although this seems harsh towards veterans its reality. I saw the movie with my grandfather who has fought war and although the love story did not compare to the harsh reality of the actual fighting he liked it. Technology today allows us to recreate scenes of war action and in Pearl Harbor the bombing, the screaming and the sadness was definitely comparable to that of the actual event. If a critical viewer wants to take the time to nit-pick every mistake or unpleasing aspect of the movie I will not look down on them, but if every movie was critisized and every flaw was closely explored, then there would be no need to see movies because critics would all say they stunk. The actors in the movie are all still young and are learning to harness their craft. So, with that in mind i feel that the emotions and the drama were well played out.  Being that this is a review I will not have contempt for those who choose to negatively critisize the movie as I hope know one will disregard my opinions. But anyone who has not seen the movie should see it and make up their own mind."	4.0	Personally, I liked this movie.	2001-06-18	3	1	2

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1IE8N2E8KBR5V	saxons now redux	Pearl Harbor is a pretty rediculous tale. Hollywood strikes again with a war movie but a stupid love tale. This film, depending on which way you want to look at it, should not have been filmed.If Pearl Harbor was meant to be historical docudrama of what actually happened that day, the money they spent was a waist. No one should ever try to make a Pearl Harbor movie, there's one out there that tops them all: Tora! Tora! Tora!Tora! Tora! Tora! is ALL fact, except for maybe one or two scenes. Everything that happens in that movie REALLY happened in reality. Pearl Harbor, however, tells the tale of two lovebirds. Stupid... To add to this, the battle scene isn't even that great. Not that it is terrible, but it could have been better.To start, the Japanese Zero planes were NOT green. They were silver. The makers of the film had them green so they would &quot;show up better.&quot; Several shots of soldiers being strafed by swimming or bodies floating in the water are from a distance, hiding you from the scene. However, there are parts that are very good.Back to my main point, if this film was made for a drama but in war, why choose Pearl Harbor? Why not some battles in Europe or something? It's not as if that love story was real, anyway(and if it was, it was corny).All in all, Pearl Harbor is overrated. If you see Pearl Harbor to see a battle scene, go ahead, but it takes an hour and a half to get there.	2.0	Difficult to understand why it was made	2003-11-24	7	5	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AEZEH3WP4IXWN	S. Calkins	The filmmakers obviously strove to duplicate the success of Titanic,  but the only thing Pearl Harbor has in common with the subject of James Cameron's movie is that it may sink as swiftly. The film certainly documents a heroic struggle: that of the actors trying to keep a straight face while delivering some of the worst lines in recent movie memory.  Ben Affleck et al have their performances torpedoed by cornball dialogue that I (thankfully) cannot quote from memory a week after the screening.  This movie is a throwback to the WWII films of the fifties and sixties.  Lead roles are occupied by &quot;movie stars&quot;, and they are surrounded by character stereotypes (the fat one, the stutterer) just so their stardom can stand out in relief.  Ham-handed music is laid on in buckets so that dim-witted moviegoers can know when their chests should swell with patriotic pride, and when they should tear up with sadness.  There is absolutely nothing ironic or complicated about this story-telling, and the third act of the so-called love story is strictly a paint-by-the numbers affair that most middle schoolers would have figured out an hour before the end of the film.  The only reason to go to this movie is to see stuff blow up -- the actual attack is nicely crafted, though its thrills are compromised by the slick, stagey quality that pervades even this sequence.  (Wait--there's one more reason. Go to this movie to see how bad Jon Voight's prosthetic chin is.  You can't tell how good his portrayal of FDR might be, because your gaze will be riveted to that hunk of latex on his face!) There is none of the grit and realism of the two great war films of the late nineties (Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line).  As far historical accuracy is concerned--well, I'm no historian, but weren't a lot of Japanese locked up in concentration camps in the US after this attack?  Did the heroism of black shipman Doris Miller really merit only a quick five minutes of screen time?  To give this subject such a superficial &quot;Hollywood&quot; treatment is to trivialize the momentous, heroic contributions and sacrifice of our armed forces at this turning point in world history.	2.0	Pandering Patriotism	2001-05-31	11	8	3

There is no real historical accuracy in this film and it was a high-budget waste of time and money. Another thing: It was just too dramatic and sappy...sound familiar?Kate Beckingsale, who I loved in ""Brokedown Palace"" left a sour taste in my mouth after this flick. I highly recommend ""Tora!

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2UY58R2JWVGK6	Scott	"Pearl Harbor is without a doubt the phoniest excuse to make a huge blockbuster movie which is exactly what Michael Bay and Bruckheimmer did. Before this movie came out, they were saying such things as ""We want to honor the survivors of Pearl Harbor"" and garbage like that. If anyone who survived Pearl Harbor saw this version, I think they would be insulted. Pearl Harbor is ripoff combination of Titanic's love story and Independence Day and Armaggedon's special effects, though nowhere near as good as any of these movies. The acting among the 3 main stars are average at best. Cuba Gooding Jr. being in this movie was ridiculous because he had absolutely no role. He was just used for star power and a poor excuse to put a black actor in the movie. Just a waste of a good talent. The movie is excrutiatingly long, well over 3 hrs. It obviously tried to copy the Titanic effect. The music was way too overdramatic, made you laugh at times. The bombing sequence which was probably a good half hour was very impressive. If that's all you're interested in then you'll get your money's worth. It was obviously the only part of the film that the directors focused on. The other 2 1/2 hrs were just thrown in. The screenplay was laughable as well. There were no memorable lines at all and it made you scratch your head that the guy who wrote Braveheart did the screenplay for this.

It's almost as if Michael Bay just said ""how can I do everything I did wrong in Armageddon, and multiply it tendfold?"" They really should have cut everything around the fight scene and just shown that. I've never seen something in such desperate need for editing.  The plot went on and on, and the love story was dull and cookie-cutter. It wasn't a decent love story like in Titanic, it was a miserably boring and uninvolving story about two people you don't care about.The only redeeming qualities of this film come from the special effects on the attack of Pearl Harbor.  If they had just cut out all the other stuff and left this in, it might make for a nice Discovery Channel special.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2UGVZFKH8O5X4	Sean Parauka	"Remember the stories that you've heard about that day, December 7, 1941? Remember the stories you've heard about when the United States of America was attacked by Japan? This movie explains it all in explicit detail along with the outstanding special effects. The movie lets you experience the real-life events that occured on that morning in Hawaii. Michael Bay did a great job bringing this movie to life along with the crew and cast members.The movie starts out with two best friends: Rafe McCawley (Affleck) and Daniel Walker (Harnett) who are training for air combat in Rhode Island. The date right now is January 1941. Rafe has to go to England to fight in RAF of England against Germany (Rememeber, World War II is being fought in Europe even though the US isn't in the war yet).Meanwhile back in Japan, the Japanese are planning the attack. It is pretty interesting how we see them planning this. They have a small pool with several floating plastic battleships all grouped next to each other just the way the ships are positioned at Pearl to see how they should attack. Then they show us how they altered the propelers on their air torpedoes so they can travel through the shallow water at Pearl.Back in Washington D.C. the Naval Intelligence is trying to find Japan's two missing carrier fleets that are somewhere in the Pacific. They have some hunches but never give a warning until the morning of the attack. Now at Pearl, Rafe is BACK the night before the attack.Now it's 7 A.M. on December 7th. Japan's 320 planes are heading straight towards Pearl. Everyone is sleeping and playing golf completely unaware of the attack. Here come all the planes flying less than fifty feet above the ground right by everyone and they're wondering what's going on. Now, the planes are surrounding battle ship row and the few men on deck either reading the paper or sweeping are looking up at the gunners and high level bombers surrounding them also wondering what's going on? They are all staring at the planes in shock. Now the first torpedo is dropped in the water. Here it goes traveling through the crystal clear water and it hits the first ship. Everyone wakes up! ""We're being BOMBED! We're being BOMBED! GET UP!"" Now all the planes are either shooting guns at all the men or the ships are being bombed. Remember that famous ship, The Arizona where over 1,000 men were trapped in when it sunk? Well, we see a Japanese high-level bomber drop a bomb on it and it blows up. The explosion looks like a big wave. The explosion of it is so INTENSE!Away from battleship row are the airfields. All the US's planes and bombers are being blown to pieces. Meanwhile Rafe and Daniel are going to a mechanic airfield that hasn't been attacked to they can get in the air and fight back. See if they can with over 300 planes bombing Pearl.Back in Washington D.C. the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt (Voigt) is in total shock. The day after, December 8th, FDR makes his famous speech, ""Yesterday, December 7, 1941. A date which will live in infamy. The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the empire of Japan (FDR Decemeber 8th)."" Now only one thing is one everyone of the US's mind.: WAR!!! See what the US will do to avenge Pearl Harbor. This movie has it all. The movie is full of outstanding special effects, great action-packed scenes and is definately another great History movie. Always remember the historic day that brought the US into World War II...Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941."	4.0	Pearl Harbor: December 7, 1941...	2003-05-12	2	2	0

It still managed to remind the movie going public that there are moments in time that should never be forgotten, but rather perpetuated eternally through the use of cinema.(...)You can call Michael Bay a hack all you want, but I seriously don't think he will care. I would like to remind everyone of the fact that not everyone (even most directors) can handle a 145 million dollar budget, get the green light from a major studio (Disney) team with one of the biggest producers of all time (Bruckheimer again, who also chose Michael to direct Bad Boys, The Rock, and Armageddon) work tirelessly for 2 years doing research about the actual people who survived the attack, deal with the casting, the location, the shooting, the post production and the marketing. So for that much I respect Michael Bay. And it was not entirely his fault Randal Wallace wrote such a trite and clich&eacute; script, some things just turn out that way. Was it unforgivable in the sense that this was supposed to have been the biggest movie of the year? Maybe, but personally, in this year of such personal tragedy and hate in the world, I would rather push it all aside and just watch the film for it's historical significance, and salute those who died in the actual attack, more than 60 years ago.(...)	3.0	Clich&eacute;?

Unless you have the sharpness dialed down on your set, or a 720p display blocking can be seen on this title pretty easily.  If you're not sensitive to it then you're lucky.  It comes through looking almost like a second layer of grain, but not the very fine grain of good film we're used to.  I know some films are intentionally grainy, but rather than error diffusion (like real grain) this movie exhibits patterned grain.  It is an artifact of MPEG2 block in motion.Titles released on Blu-Ray in VC1 encoding have proven how much better they can look.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AL8QEQOAZNEQL	sharks	A terrible movie -- insulting and offensive. From the guys who brought us 'Armageddon' -- a film that I enjoyed simply because it was a big ridiculous thrill ride with just the right blend of cheese and FX. 'Pearl Harbor' is made with the same formula (and one of the same actors, Ben &quot;Get me to a damn plane!&quot; Affleck, who is nothing but an overgrown frat boy strutting for the camera), but it fails because when you put a name, face and race on a metaphorical asteroid and call it the Japanese, the fun disappears and the slurs begin (I stopped counting the times I heard &quot;damn Japs&quot;). Yes, the FX are great, but it's Titantic territory revisited, and after a while you're yawning your way through yet another extra flailing in the water, yet another explosion, etc. They should have made the battles scenes into a one hour reenactment for cable and cut out the rest of the film -- the hour before and the hour after the attack are incredibly predictable and full of pandering, formulaic cheese. The love story is disjointed and the characters are cartoons -- Affleck is his usual brawny mess, Josh Harnett puts forth a decent young-Tommy-Lee-Jones effort but can't save his doomed Danny, and Kate Beckinsale pulls a Kate Winslet by hopping from a respected place on the international/independent circuit to an unfortunate hair-and-makeup turn in a disaster blockbuster (Winslet has barely recovered from &quot;the boat film&quot;... let's cross our fingers for poor Beckinsale, who shouldn't be wasting her time with stuff like this).  Why Cuba Gooding, Jr. chose to take part at all is beyond me. Dan Ackroyd, on the other hand, is right up his own alley as the Navy Intelligence man who saw it coming -- in real life, Ackroyd is the Alien Intelligence man who is waiting for an extraterrestrial encounter so that he can tell us he told us so... so I think he had some fun. As for Alec Baldwin, he's on the fast track to becoming one of the worst actors of all time, and Jon Voight is apparently trying to add historical charicatures to his resume (he's following his cartoon Roosevelt with another study in prosthetics as Howard Cosell in 'Ali'). 'Pearl Harbor' rips off many other disaster/war films from 'Titanic' to 'Top Gun', and is nothing more than a great big mess. I don't condemn it completely because of Hartnett's effort, the FX, and James King, who makes an easy, natural step from highly succesful model to competent actress (her Betty is one of the few characters you actually feel something for, spared simply because she wasn't given the screen time to become a cartoon).

Rife	"I tried hard to find something to like about this movie, but other than Hans Zimmer's film score (and even that was substandard compared to his other works), this movie was a massive disappointment.Based on the bad reviews, I went in with low expectations and Michael Bay failed to meet even those.  Although Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale tried hard with a bad script, aside from their efforts the acting was cardboard, the dialogue was shallow, the love-story plot was predictable and unoriginal, the special effects were WAY overpriced (prop planes don't fly like X-wing fighters), and the history-well, from end to end the movie was replete with historical errors, from mundane stuff (e.g., incorrect uniforms, wrongly painted aircraft) to more serious errors (e.g., Doolittle Raid bombers flying in formation, at altitude, with fighter pilots at the controls, providing running commentary on the radio, etc. etc. etc.)  By themselves, each of the errors is insignificant, but taken together, they give the lie to Bay's claim that this would be the most historically accurate film possible.  They also raise the question:  if you're going to spend this much money to make a movie, isn't worthwhile to get your facts straight (especially when you don't have to be a history professor to get them)?About the only good thing I can say about this moive is that if it helps to instill some appreciation of our country's history in people who didn't have that appreciation before, then it will have served a good purpose.  But if you want an accurate historical portrayal of Pearl Harbor (using real aircraft as opposed to unrealistic pretenders), you're not going to do better than ""Tora, Tora, Tora.""  If you want a quality love story set against the backdrop of the Pearl Harbor attack, you can't beat ""From Here to Eternity.""  As far as this one goes, save your money.

The attack scenes were wonderful, but the plot and love scenes were predictable and unimaginative.

Not to say that WWII movies are bad (they are very good), but there are lots of them.  Well, it's another WWII movie, but one of the best ones.  It showed how war often broke relationships, but sometimes it strengthened them.  If you go see it, pay special attention to how the relationships change.  Another thing that was so good about it was how things constntly changed unexpectedly in the plot.  I won't give those away, but once you see it you will know what I mean.

The combination of love and war was nice, because I don&#8217;t think war movies should be too heavy, after all, it is entertainment. The attack on Pearl Harbor was excellent, but was not as good as the hype made it sound like. I did not feel passionate, only impressed. The movie was not a failure---rather nicely tuned, the typical Hollywood fanfare with chewed over story line that usually leaves the population gratified; Neither was it a milestone ---nothing superbly creative, more like school work, with no disrespect to the cast and director.

I think that the Doolittle raid deserves a film in its own right, it is a classic story of WW2.The film should also have concentrated on the real human drama of what happened on dec 4 1941, using actual historical characters, the USN, USMC, USAAF and US army produced many real heroes on that day.Making a film about their exploits would have been a far better tribute.	2.0	Inferior to &quot;Tora Tora Tora&quot;	2002-04-10	3	3	0

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AMR5NRN2SMF8X	Southern Cross	To begin with, I would give this movie 2 1/2 stars instead if the rating were available. Apparently the same one or two people have written most of the last couple of dozen reviews, and they REALLY didn't like it. Its good points-the special effects are GREAT, it has a good cast, and it concerns an important event in our history which deserves to be remembered, especially appropriate now that the U.S. is at war again after suffering another sneak attack. The attack itself is well done, and the CGI is fitted in well within those scenes. The film examines some points not delved into much in other films about the attack. For instance, most of the 2,000 Americans who perished in the battle drowned below decks of their stricken and sinking ships, never having seen their attackers. Their struggle is shown in a compelling and moving fashion.Its bad points-it's WAY too long, it's too sappy and sentimental, there are too many unlikely coincidences in the story, and it doesn't try hard enough to provide all the pertinent facts about the attack. Showing Dolittle's retaliatory raid on Japan at the end was a good idea, but it made it a bit long. If they had cut out at least half of the sappy love triangle, it would have helped move the story along and reduced the length to a more tolerable level.The two main characters are loosely (VERY loosely) based on two American pilots who managed to get airborne during the attack and account for 6 Japanese planes between them. Apparently just shooting them down wasn't dramatic enough in itself, so the movie has the two Americans nearly flying into each other to get two Zeros following in pursuit to crash into each other. That is perhaps the most ridiculous moment, but there are a few others. Nevertheless, I found the movie overall to be enjoyable enough to watch. However, if you really want to watch a well-done film about the attack that is historically accurate, without the burden of a plodding love triangle, buy Tora! Tora! Tora! and just rent this one, or catch it on the tube.	3.0	C'mon, it's not THAT bad	2003-12-06	1	1	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A16VBJPJ3T3MFE	"""spbxwing"""	"""Pearl Harbor"", in terms of story structure, is sort of a remake of the 1953 classic ""From Here To Eternity"". It mainly concerns a love triangle, which is briefly interrupted by an attack on the U.S. fleet by the Japanese Navy. The only thing missing from ""Pearl"" is `Eternity""'s intelligent script, engaging characters and challenging ending. This being a Michael Bay picture (""Armageddon"", ""The Rock"") they do eventually get around to making stuff go kerblooey real good.As James Cameron did with ""Titanic"", Bay focuses on fictional star-crossed lovers who make goo-goo eyes at each other until history intervenes and spoils all their fun. Specifically, it's a love triangle involving Rafe (Ben Affleck), his boyhood friend Danny (Josh Hartnett) and Evelyn (Kate Beckinsdale). Rafe and Evelyn laugh and love together in slow motion until Rafe joins up with the British Royal Air Force (one of the real howlers is the scene where Rafe prepares to depart for England from New York - via Grand Central station. I didn't know you could get to England from New York on a train) and is presumed dead in a nasty air battle. Danny gets his chance with Evelyn, but a while later, Rafe shows up alive, enraged that these two would carry on like this just because they thought he was a goner. The nerve!The rivalry between the boys is forgotten when those dirty, rotten Japs start bombing the heck out of Pearl Harbor, and everybody takes his or her station to repel the attack (or, in Navy nurse Evelyn's case, tending to the wounded). Here's where the movie comes alive; the 40-minute attack sequence is unforgettable, undoubtedly the most intensely sustained combat scene since the D-Day invasion in ""Saving Private Ryan"". George Lucas's Industrial Light &amp; Magic outdoes itself with this segment, making the explosions and sinkings of the huge American ships absolutely believable.The problem, and it's a big one, is everything that comes before and after the attack. The love story is so painfully boring and hackneyed, you almost find yourself yearning for the Japanese to start dropping the bombs on our guys - just so you can actually watch something interesting.The dialogue is on a par with some of the worst stuff you've heard on soap operas and in every B-movie ever made: ""If I had one more night to live, I'd want to spend it with you."" ""Let's play chicken with those Japs!"" ""You're not gonna die! You can't die!!"" That's just a light sampling. I think someone actually says, ""We've lost the battle, but we'll win the war.""And who in God's name cast this movie, anyway? Ben Affleck's name above the title?!? That might be one of the signs of the coming apocalypse. Affleck was mildly diverting as Matt Damon's loyal pal in ""Good Will Hunting"", but in a John Wayne role like this, he's way out of his league. Hartnett basically manages to look good without stumbling over his lines. You could call him the next Keanu Reeves. Beckinsdale's main asset is her natural beauty and her `40s-era features. Sometimes, she even makes the laughable dialogue sound kinda nice.The supporting characters, who happen to be real people, don't get much justice with the exception of black Navy cook Dorrie Miller, who manned an anti-aircraft gun during the attack and won a medal for his bravery. Oscar winner Cuba Gooding, Jr. imbues the role, small as it is, with gusto and dignity. Washed-up cinematic fossil Jon Voight sleepwalks through his role as President Franklin Roosevelt; you'd think a has-been like Voight would be happy to at least have landed the gig, but he gives his performance about as much energy as Marlon Brando has in recent years. And what happened to Alec Baldwin? Didn't he used to be really good, even great? He's so lethargic as Col. Jimmy Doolittle, I suspected a crew member might have had to keep him propped up during shooting (or maybe two or three crew members - Baldwin's seen too much of the buffet table lately). I longed for movies where Baldwin really distinguished himself, as in ""The Hunt For Red October"", Malice"" or ""The Edge"" (rent ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" and check out his explosive cameo as a foul-mouthed creep. It's seven minutes of pure brilliance, maybe because he essentially played himself).Another thing that didn't make me laugh but disturbed me greatly was the way the film treats the Japanese with such kid gloves. This is no doubt a result, not only of 21st Century political correctness (we can only demonize our enemies now if they're white Europeans), but of financial considerations for Disney, which bankrolled this mess. They'll be releasing ""Pearl Harbor"" in Japan soon, and Disney has an aversion to offending anyone except - you guessed it - white Europeans. According to the movie, the Japanese attack was provoked by our oil embargo against them. They had no choice, you see? What the film fails to mention is that our embargo was a response to sickening, unspeakable atrocities committed by the Japanese forces against unarmed civilians throughout Asia (read Iris Chang's remarkable, haunting book ""The Rape Of Nanking"" to get a sample of what the Japanese considered to be honorable warfare).In the end, for all their talk of honoring veterans of Pearl Harbor, Bay and Producer Jerry Bruckheimer have actually done them a disservice. The real deaths and sacrifices that occurred at Pearl Harbor are used primarily as a backdrop, a subplot used to serve a shallow, stupid Harlequinn romance. If Michael Bay's trying to be taken seriously as a filmmaker, he has a long way to go."	2.0	Pearl Harbor: Mickey Mouse Goes To War	2001-05-28	0	0	0

Praznik	&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; has it all:  likeable characters, an old-fashioned love story, great action sequences, and a wonderful sense of patriotism.  It is a must-see film for everyone today.  Because of the production/direction team (Jerry Bruckheimer, Micheal Bay), I had high expectations for this film and I certainly was not disappointed.  The film, I believe, captures the mood of our country at that time, a mixture of innocence and untested bravery.  It also attempts to explain the circumstances leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor and depicts the Japanese as courageous with a brilliant military strategy that brought devastation and chaos to a place unprepared for such an event.  It shows the way Americans had to grow up overnight and prove their own courage.  The movie doesn't fail in any regard, it combines entertainment and education, humor and pathos, pride and regret. It's not an anti-war film, but neither is it going to make anyone anxious to experience another war.Like all box-office smash hits, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; may not be critically acclaimed; but in my opinion, it's the best all-around movie in years, certainly as good as &quot;Titanic&quot; in romance and special effects, but with an added dimension that should appeal to everyone's sense of pride and patriotism.  Do yourself a favor and see &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; on the big screen.  The audience participation was excellent by young and old alike.  And I can honestly say, it's even better the second time.	5.0	Best Movie in Years	2001-05-29	17	11	6

I think that people go into the film looking for a total war movie, similar to Saving Private Ryan or Tora Tora Tora, and do not understand that this film is supposed to set these events in a personal level. The movie is meant to help people today understand how the war affected real people living in it, not just to portray the blood and guts of battle. That has been done.  I feel that Pearl Harbor had unbelievable action sequences, a touching love story and was very well acted and put together. how those bombing scenes are portrayed and recreated is unbelievable. I have seen the movie 4 times now and would gladly go again. I recommend it to anyone who has a heart and I know you will love it!	5.0	Well worth three hours...	2001-06-19	7	3	4

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A18CRS4FLVH5YW	"Star Sailor ""Worldwide Traveler"""	"It's frustrating to sit and read some these reviews.  I think it's time people like me actually review some of the reviews since some people have no idea how to voice a proper opinion without saying something wrong with a completely brilliant production!  First off, a good reviewer will know how hard it is to get a movie off the ground as well as how much work it really takes to ensure it becomes a hit.  Be reminded that thousands of people worked countless hours to make this thing come to life!  Based on some of the serious grammatical errors I see on some of these reviews, they probably don't work near as hard in their own lives so I guess they digress to harping on other peoples work.  That's the nature of the beast, oh well.What's really engaging about this movie to me is that it was shot so beautifully and so eloquently who gives a hoot where the story is going?  The movie gets the job done!So, they have a love triangle-that's cool, you appeal to the lovesick teenage girls who just can't get enough of Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett, not to mention the guys who love watching Kate Beckensale-WOOF!  Bottom line, see, ""From here to eternity,"" and you'll see that Hollywood has been using similar formulas for years in war movies!So, you have flawed historical accounts in a movie-sorry to say it folks, but EVERY movie has that, it keeps continuity to the STORY, not HISTORY itself.  We already have read the ""history"" of Pearl Harbor a million times, why not take a tangent here and there?So, you have bad acting, almost every film that has been a success did not become a success on Oscar winning actors alone.  No one really knows why some things work and some things don&#65533;t, why speak your mind about something already said?  Get over it!  It doesn't say anything about the DVD product!So, it was PG-13, ah ha!  Look what we have coming down the pike!  Low and behold AN R RATED VERSION COMING TO DVD MAY 16TH!  Personally I liked the PG-13 version myself because I felt comfortable taking my twelve-year-old nephew to see the film.  He loves me talking about my adventures in the Navy and I felt at ease that there wouldn't be a ton of gore to make the attack scenes even more horrifying.  Keep in mind, this is a Disney flick and even though it doesn't have Disney written all over it, they still have a rep to protect.  Again, most reviews are not focusing on the DVD itself!When doing reviews on Amazon, people need to keep in mind that the movie has been reviewed a million times and considering how popular of a movie Pearl Harbor was, most everyone has in one form or another-SEEN THE MOVIE!  Get off the high horse of opinionating the movie!  Reviews have long since past!  Review the product! That's what a consumer will want to read!  For instance;How is the sound of the Pearl Harbor DVD?  Phenomenal if you ask me!  My home theatre system is peaked when I put this DVD in!How is the picture of the DVD?  First rate, not a blemish to report here and actually the colors are far more vibrant on the DVD than they ever were in the theatre.  With the exception of a slight pause around the middle of the film, this DVD picture is flawless.Does the DVD have extras?  You bet!  Lots of them!  The new Vista Series DVD (which by the way has released several great versions of previous movies including ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable."") will include even more extras as well as the R-rated version on two discs.  TOO COOL!These are the things consumers want to know before buying a product.  I could care less about your opinion of a film!  Let the consumer be the judge of a film!  Consumers need your input on the product!  I would hope Amazon improves the review system by deleting unnecessary reviews and highlighting the ones that really ""work"" for the product they are selling! To all of you reviewers out there (including me), focus on the content of the product and leave the movie reviews to the real critics, since that's what they get paid for!

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AF5F5657AFPSM	starz35	On contrary to all those bashing Pearl Harbor, I geniunely enjoyed it.  It gave me a look at the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  Especially after going over WWII in our history class, Pearl Harbor was a great movie to conclude it.  I understand that the history is quite vague in the movie, but please keep in mind that this is a MOVIE.  I repeat, a MOVIE, NOT another special on the History Channel.  It was meant for us to enjoy the new technologies used in film-making and to have a feel of what happened during WWII--the romances, the fate of soldiers, and just the overall impact the war had made on these people.  The bombing of Pearl Harbor was the perfect example that NOBODY wins in a war.  It is a good updated reminder for all of us about the perils of war.  It is a great movie for anyone to watch, especially 10-12 year olds who are not familiar with WWII events yet.  Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and I'm sure MANY would enjoy it.  Just sit back and enjoy the film!	5.0	ENJOYABLE MOVIE!	2001-06-05	3	1	2

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AJDYDG7YZY9QL	Stephen A. Haines	". . .  of the worst war film ever produced.  The plot of this film is stretched so thin it's likely to break.  It certainly broke me from seeing any more trite films like it.  A hot pilot with poor vision stretches his career from illegally flying for the RAF [against the wrong model of Bf109] to being one of the two Warhawk pilots to get aloft during the Pearl Harbour attack to flying a Mitchell bomber in the propaganda raid against Tokyo!  Along the way he meets, gains and loses the girl.  Of course, he retrieves her again, but this is Hollywood.  What else could happen?As if the plot wasn't thin enough, some clown put Afleck in the lead role.  Someone should find Afleck a proper day job - cleaning the heads, dumping the honey wagon or robbing graves. Anything but putting him before a camera and inflicting that flat excuse for characterisation on an unsuspecting public.  None of the actors in this film are given a proper role, with the sole exception of Jon Voight.  Poor old Dan Ackroyd would have been super as the intelligence officer Ellis Zacharias, even if he is a bit plump for the part.  Instead, he plays some ephemeral naval officer championing the defense of Pearl instead of the Philippines or Marianas Islands.  Alec Baldwin is slipped in as Jimmy Doolittle, a role that, given the story line, should have been the lead.  But then, of course, all that romantic lead-up would have been wasted.  As was Baldwin.It's difficult to understand the intent in making this film.  All sense of why the Japanese launched the attack is blithely omitted.  Justified or not, we are left with only the ""day of infamy"" attitude.  There's relevance in presenting that, but Japan didn't launch the War of the Pacific on a whim.  Their purpose, in their view, was to prevent encirclement.  No lessons are to be derived from the story or the events portrayed.  There was heroism on both sides, but you'd never glean that from watching this.  Yamamoto's American experience and misgivings are overlooked, except for a single line.  The Emperor's role, which was significant, is also omitted.  The United States was attacked, suffering a terrible blow.  Any military historian will explain it was a blessing in disguise as attention was diverted from the ungainly battleships to more flexible carrier flotillas.  All this film portrays are implausible characters, a love story so trite as to be nauseating, and a surfeit of violence.

It is shallow, completely inaccurate from a historical point of view, and Hollywood at it's worst.  America entered WWII under a variety of extenuating circumstances - none of them being that the Japanese broke up a love triangle.The battle scenes are awful, the special effects are terrible, the dialogue is more trite than Titanic's, the characters are not developed, the score is poorly done, the plot is ludicrously unrealistic, and historical accuracy is ignored.  THIS MOVIE REPRESENTS EVERYTHING WRONG WITH HOLLYWOOD AND AMERICA!We should not watch war merely for entertainment purposes. Though sometimes necessary, war is a serious and tragic event, and a war movie should embrace this fact and serve to educate as well as entertain the audience...I'm insulted as an American that this movie ever made it across through middle management.	1.0	Who does Jerry Bruckheimer think he is?	2002-04-11	0	0	0

This movie was a bunch of garbage. The movie was rated PG-13 for Sustained Intense War Sequences, Imanges of Wounded, Breif Sensuality and Some language. Some language. The actors/actress in this movie must have swear at least 50 times and that is not some lanuage. Pearl Harbor was bomed on the day of December 7, 1941. And 60 years after that this dumb movie was made. The movie starts on Disc 1 and the last 54 minutes are on Disc 2 (which I didn't expect). If you have read this review and found it helpul please vote. But If you have read this review and not found it helpful please don't vote. Did Hollywood think we needed this movie? I am glad that neither me or my parents was born or living on December 7, 1941. Please trust me and skip this movie because there are much better movies out there. Pearl Harbor was bomed by the Japenease. Which means me wonder what people of America did to the people of Japan that made them to decide to bomb Pearl Harbor. At the time of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii was not one of the United States. Please do not view this movie. This movie really does deserve zero stars. This movie should not have been made in the first place. All copies of this movie should be destroyed. Or if not, locked in a castle of films to never be released, just as long as you stay away from this movie.	1.0	Where is the zero star choice?	2002-12-14	2	1	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1FNES0QEBJZD1	Steve Douglas	While I do have the standard def 60th Anniversary edition of this movie, this will not be a side by side comparison between the two, and since enough opinions have been ventured regarding the story line's accuracy, opinions on acting et all, this review will focus only upon the actual quality of the transfer to Blu Ray.VIDEO....The video imaging is quite clean throughout the film with no artifacting in any place that I could notice.  With the many action scenes, stair stepping of some of the images might have prevailed but I saw none.  Thus, I was pretty pleased with what I saw.  Color imaging is, for most of the scenes, very warm yet not overly so.  There was nothing artificial appearing in the transfer to Blu Ray.  There is only the very slightest of small grain which was barely noticeable in a few scenes and would not be noticed at all if you weren't actually looking for it.  The Mbps rate varied greatly from the low twenties to 40Mbps but I would say that the average rate was in the high 20's.  Contrast was very good and neither overly sharp or soft.  Small details in areas like a characters hair could easily be discerned and blacks appeared to be rich and true.Keep in mind, however, that the quality of what you see and hear is also dependent upon the quality of the TV monitor you are watching on as well as the home theater set up you are using. The monitor I use is a fairly new Panasonic ZT 65&#34; plasma and the amps, speakers, cables, BluRay player and Surround Processor I use are hi end esoteric gear to provide me with a more realistic and objective perspective.AUDIO....The audio provided is a lossless LCPM track that provided very clean and transparent dialogue and soundtrack.  All audio levels were properly set and balanced so there should be no reason to have to play roller coaster with your remote's volume control.  The 5.1 audio is one that I wish had been offered as a 7.1 audio option.  There is very good use of all of your surround speakers with a goodly amount of panning between the front and rear channels as well as left and right channels.  When planes come from behind you and pan forward from the rear speakers, it is a treat.  Especially during the battle scenes, there is a nice amount of discreet channeling for foley effects and the like.  Dialogue was almost wholly from the center channel speaker.EXTRAS....There are no new extras on this blu ray and all of them can be found on the Standard Def 2 disc set that I own.  These include a documentary on how this film made it to the screen, an interesting History channel doc on the 'Unsung Heros', a music video and trailer.  Unfortunately, there is also a preview of the many blu rays from this company.  I really do hate these as they take up room on the Blu Ray disc itself and make you pay for their advertising.  They also allow less room for other extras as well as more compression of the film you are actually paying for resulting in a loss of actual filmic quality.  The standard def disc had a definite bibliography that the Blu Ray does not, probably sacrificed to the advertising of other films.All in all, the standard def version was pretty good even with a lossy DTS 5.1 audio so I do not think that there is a night and difference between the two movie formats.  Never the less, the Blu Ray is really of high quality and very well worth having in your collection.I do hope that this review, which focused solely upon the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase. All of my reviews are of this nature and I hope they can be of HELP to you as well.Thanks for reading.	5.0	Pearl Harbor on Blu Ray	2014-03-17	3	2	1

The rest was a sappy love triangle.  Two fighter pilots (Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett) are in love with an army nurse (Kate Beckinsale).  The movie picks up with the forty minute-long action and that brings the movie from a 1 star rating to a 4 star rating but the love scenes are bad.  The film is reminescent of the equally love-twisted but action-filled ""Titanic"".  Though this movie may not make the money ""Titanic"" made (it's the #1 best selling movie ever) it's worth a see.  The plot is set in 1941 when the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor took place.  The action is great.  This movie was rated PG-13 for intense war sequences  and action, plus images of wounded people, a few curse words, and kissing."	4.0	Good but...	2001-07-10	0	0	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1JJOV69MAU2J2	Steven Dennis	This disappointing and emotionally bankrupt take on Dec. 7, 1941 pulls out every manipulative trick in the book -- the soldier who comes back from the dead, the love triangle, the hokey ending -- and yet still fails to ultimately engage the viewer.The 40-minute battle scene, seen as the best part of the movie by most reviewers, is undeniably stunning. But for all of the technical prowess and craft displayed, the combat itself takes on a video game-type quality lacking in the visceral emotions that one would expect to experience in a war movie. To me, this was the Disneyfication of Pearl Harbor. One of the most brutal days in American history, and yet most of the blood is not up close and in your face, it's comfortably in the background, perhaps not to offend their apparent target 15-year-old girl Titanic audience. Even the hospital scenes have a gauzy white sheen between us and the wounded, a technique that does not work and further removes us from the action. The scenes of soldies being strafed while swimming in the water could have been far more powerful, but in this rendition the bodies look like ants on the screen. Worse yet, unlike in Titanic, where we came to know the cast and were thus interested in their various fates, the main characters here are removed from the action, until they stage an improbable (but somewhat true to history) aerial defense with two planes. To the viewers, the deaths of thousands of soldiers has about the same impact as a laser rifle striking down a Storm Trooper in Star Wars, because we don't know the soldiers in the thick of the action -- they are merely fodder for the special effects.As far as the ship capsizing scenes, it was extremely Titanic-derivative.The love story, which takes up an astounding 2 hours of the 3-hour epic, is neither horrible nor good; it's simply pedestrian. You don't spend $200 million on a movie for pedestrian, do you? There are plenty of hokey plot developments, oodles of laughable dialogue, and some bad accents thrown in for good measure.The thing about this movie is, despite all of my complaints, I actually came out of the theater thinking that it was pretty good -- a three star flick. But over time, the visual impact of the special effects fades and you are left with disappointment in a war movie that wasn't, a $200 million mediocre piece of schlock that gets its by-the-numbers two stars, but ultimately a missed opportunity for greatness. (I would have loved to see the James Cameron version of P.H.!)By the way, watching this movie on video or DVD will likely lessen the impact even more, since those special effects will be reduced and those ant-soldiers will become dust-mite soldiers. If you are going to watch P.H., at least watch it on the big screen.Last week, I saw Apocalypse Now Redux, which, while it shares a three-hour-plus length, is ten times better than Pearl Harbor. If you want to see what a real war movie looks like, do yourself a favor and watch Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece.	2.0	A $200 million mediocrity...	2002-09-14	26	19	7
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3VQSFORKH8B7O	Steven Hancock	Thyis is by far the best film that the year 2001 has delivered. The three hour film takes you on an exciting roller coaster ride through some of the most tragic and heroic events of World War II. There's the Dolittle Raid of April, 1942. There's also the events of the Battle of Britain in early 1941. And, of course, the Pearl Harbor attack of  December 7th, 1941. The title sequence of the film is a master stroke: mixing fact and fiction to create a forty-minute sequence that, as the creators of the film had hoped, takes you back to that tragic time in history. Every member of the cast and production team gave their all to create this $140 Million film. But I can't believe it actually cost that much. Upon seeing it, I woulda have told you that this movie cost somwhere between $200 Million and $250 Million. Anyone interested in World War II, or romance films, will enjoy this film. You'll laugh, cheer, cry, and gasp. I guarantee it! Grade: A+	5.0	EXCITING! POWERFUL! LAVISHLY PRODUCED!	2001-07-26	3	1	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A11QEG8FPCBBTD	Steven Heiting	Fantasy is one thing but when an event of major historical significance is trivialized to fiction, I think it's a disgrace. A 60th anniversary commemorative edition? This movie is an insult to those who were actually there and the entire generation who lived through or died in WWII.It is nothing more than the producers' attempt to benefit from the anniversary of others' misfortune.Sure Ben Affleck is in the Eagle Squadron in England and is shot down over the English Channel and NOBODY knows he survived until he miraculously turns up in Pearl Harbor. Did he swim all the way?Then he and Josh Hartnett are the ONLY ones to get their planes in the air during the Japanese attack. Then we see them trying to save sailors trapped in the Arizona because, apparently, nobody else could do it.Then Affleck and Hartnett become pilots for the Doolittle Raid, in spite of the differences between flying a fighter and a bomber, not to mention flying bombers off an aircraft carrier deck.And when Hartnett dies in the Doolittle Raid, they drag his rotting carcass all the way across China with Japanese soldiers on their ass so there can be a hero's return in a coffin at Pearl Harbor? Puh-lease!Interwoven is a lame love story that has a syrupy ending.Hollywood has taken fictionalized characters and made them larger than the event on which the movie is based. Therefore, this movie flat-out sucks.	1.0	An insult to those who were there	2010-05-03	5	4	1
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A18M5DJGW3SSWW	Steven Pinto	I'll be the first to admit, the first half hour of this movie is really cheesy (with lines like Beckingsale writing to Affleck that she &quot;watches the sunrise and tries to take out each last bit of energy from it&quot; or some line that makes you want to throw up). After that however, it is a great, gripping film. Affleck, after the first half hour, is terrific and Beckingsale is adequate. Hartnett I believe is the real star of the film, in a true star making performance. The special effects are top notch as every one knows, and the ending gets you on the edge of your seat. Even as a guy, I welled up with tears when Cuba Gooding Jr. got his hands on the big machine gun and started firing away. Flawed movie? Yes. Great movie?

I have a feeling that the main characters were ripped off from some other story. And personally I think Josh Hartnett is the only one doing a decent job while the rests fall below standard.Secondly, the DVD presentation is extremely disappointing. The only reason I choose to buy DVDs is to get the whole movie uninterrupted. Of course I prefer DVDs with lots of extra features. However, I feel that just because there are not enough extra features to fill up the second disc, the studio actually divided the movie into 2 parts!This movie is only 3-hour-long, the same as &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; and &quot;Braveheart&quot;, so I don't see any reason why the studio needs to split it into 2 discs.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AL277B4AQCWBG	Steven Reynolds	"An abomination on almost every level, ""Pearl Harbor"" tries to remake ""Titanic"" by fusing romance, history and gobsmacking CGI, but it sinks without a trace.  Though who can blame them for trying?  On paper, both films look disastrous: mega-budget, period chick flicks in which nearly everybody dies and everyone knows the ending.  But ""Titanic"" worked (for teen girls with deep pockets, at least), so why couldn't it work again?  Maybe with James Cameron at the helm and Leo in the cockpit it would have stood a chance, but with Bay and Bruckheimer calling the shots, it tanks.  As it stands, this film's singular achievement is to render one of the most significant, tragic and exciting episodes in American history completely and utterly boring.  Randall Wallace's dire screenplay with its tired love triangle and upbeat, ludicrously revisionist ending is more than half the problem, and a surprisingly unconvincing Ben Affleck accounts for most of the rest.  Cuba Gooding Jr - playing the most interesting character in the entire film - gets about three minutes screentime.  The trailer was great, and it might have made a nice music video if Faith Hill's power ballad didn't somehow manage to give you the creeps.  What's most disappointing is that everyone involved in this picture is capable of so much more than this (yes, even Ben). It's torture.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3XMO0OGZ5N9Z	Stuart Humpert	This movie is obviously about the attack on Pearl Harbor. But it is extremely flawed.Historically, there are many incorrect facts. One example iswhen Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck are flying their planes low above the airfield and they are communicating via radios to the guy down on the runway.The love story is corny, and the tragedy of the attack and &quot;sadness&quot; of the love story is so obviously forced, I find it actually dishonorable to the real life attack on Pearl Harbor. The love story is very predictable, and overly acted, and most definitely not helped by corny lines like &quot;I'll never look at another sunset without thinking of you&quot;.The battle is okay, but filled with way too much computerized animation. A lot of the effects were so obviously CG effects. The CG effects actually get repetitive. Just about everytime a CG airplane explodes or crashes, chunks of it fly at the camera. It looks cool if it is done once or twice, but not 20 times. But ILM still did a great job. They are the only reason why the movie gets a 1. Really a one and a half. I congratulate them on a movie well computerized.The Japanese perspective on the lead-up to Pearl Harbor is enjoyable, and just about the only best part in the movie. But it looks like it is their just to pass the time. And the scenes that you do see are rushed. The scene where the dialogue goes something like &quot;I fear all we did was to awaken a sleeping giant&quot; is the most important piece of dialogue in the movie, but it isn't given enough screen time for it to really sink into the viewer.The second tape is just a weak attempt at making the movie an epic movie, and really just made the movie seem like it was dragging on. And the presentation in widescreen kept giving me the feeling that the director did that so it would look more epic. Talk about falling flat on your face.Then there is the whole end to the battle. The end makes it seem as if we won when we really didn't. Pearl Harbor was a huge loss to America. But the movie gives the false sense that we won.Anyways, there is so much to criticize, but this is already long enough. In short, the movie is horrible and corny. It was so bad that &quot;I'll never go to bed without thinking of how terrible this movie was.&quot;	1.0	The worst movie. Do not see it.	2001-12-18	10	5	5

Having to suffer through what was more like a 30 second melodramtic television commercial turned into an hour and a half - OUCH!  Nobody to blame but myself, who bought it?  I made it through the first disc, just to see the only good part.  Having done that, maybe I'll play the second - one day.  On some dreary Sunday when I need a nap.

For three hours, I sat there watching 'Pearl Harbor' with avid attention. Everything faded away into nothingness and I felt like I was AT Pearl Harbor, reliving everything, only it was just beginning. Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale made a great on-screen couple and Josh Hartnett went down well as Danny, Ben Affleck's character's best friend. The only thing, aside from some of the mixed up historical facts, that left me wanting would be the love story. If Danny have not fallen for Evelyn (Kate), then everything would have been just fine. As it was, everything became all messy. Also, Cuba Gooding Jr. did not make as much of an impact as did the other stars. I thought that it was rather unfair to him, seeing that Cuba Gooding Jr. is a very talented actor. Jon V. and Alec Baldwin were also kinda left out. Overall, though, I thought that it was excellent and it would not hurt to see more of Ben Affleck. To all those who compared 'Titanic' to 'Pearl Harbor', 'Pearl Harbor' is definitely higher on my list!	5.0	Took my breath away...............	2001-06-29	1	0	1

Those moviegoers who saw the tear-jerking war epic and came out shaking their heads in disgust were all expecting too much. Pearl Harbor is meant to be both a historic picture and a love story, but anyone who is able to watch the movie with an open mind will realize that director Michael Bay uses the naval base as the setting for a love triangle. Those who went to the movie expecting a movie about Pearl Harbor and what actually happened there with a sub-plot about a courageous young pilot, his shy best friend and a beautiful nurse we're doomed to be disappointed.The acting isn't awful; the story is emotional and moving and, let's remember, it was an Oscar nominee.	4.0	Good	2002-08-07	6	1	5

Disney created Japanese version of script so that they can make a lot of money in Japan. In Japanese version, Americans are much nicer to Japanese, even Col.Dolittle is nice to Japan. Also, the scene where Japanese high command doing meeting to discuss Pearl Harbor attack outside where children are playing with kites....simply showing lack of common scene and intellect of Americans. As a Japanese living in America, I know this is wrong. I'm having hard time explaining about America to my Japanese friends who think that Americans &quot;innocently&quot; enjoy this movie.Some Japanese are sorry for Americans because of this movie.Would Americans create 9.11.01 love story or commedy? Would Americans create 9.11.01 movie where Americans are nice to terrolists? Do respect history and facts (and even enemy), but this one is way out of line.Pearl Harbor as an &quot;entertainment&quot;?

I was curious to see what kind of result we'd get from Jerry Bruckheimer. After waiting in line opening night for three hours, I watched in horror as a horrific American event was turned into a sappy love story. Instead of the movie focusing on the actual event, and the heroes of December 7th, we had to endure watching two idiots fight over a woman, and then the attack scene. I will admit, the attack scene was very dramatic and the special effects were wonderful. That is the only positive thing I can say about this movie. Tora! Tora! Tora! is the only movie about Pearl Harbor that I will acknowledge as a decent piece of filmmaking regarding this crucial event in American history.	2.0	Just plain offensive	2001-12-12	8	6	2

The movie is surely not disrepectful to what really happened in december 7, in fact it is very respectful....there were no jokes, no music playing and no censoring. what they played really happened......the story between the three stars is true clich&eacute;, and leaves you with that &quot;deja v&uacute;&quot; feeling,you know.....girl meets boy. boy falls for girl and vice-versa. boy and girl start going out and immediately all those couple scenes start playing showing what couples do and just showing us how cute they look together. Boy#2 goes in. Girl falls for boy #2. Girl becomes confused and in doubt. There is a conflict between the boys. something happens ( usually tragic). BOOM. we've all seen that before, but anyone who is careful to notice that it is clich&eacute; should be able to notice that the story and the character's feelings go way beyond that. Their anguish mixes with the anguish others in the movie suffered and so does there pain and there isolation and confusion. everything is a big metaphor.....I personally liked this movie, however some downsides to it is that it is a bit too patriotic ( then again, what can u expect from USA?) and that they portray the Japanese as being the bad guys ( so they might appear as the good guys) when in fact no one is to blame for what occured.	5.0	let's be reasonable	2001-06-15	2	0	2

Every aspect of this film has been done better in at least one movie. The love story cannot compare to ""From Here to Eternity."" The events at Pearl Harbor are surpassed by ""Tora, Tora, Tora."" The Doolittle raid was covered more enjoyably in ""60 Seconds Over Tokyo."" This film is a pale version of all those great movies. Was this movie great as some reviewers contend? Not when compared to those and ""The Battle of Midway"", ""The Flying Leathernecks"", or even ""South Pacific"". The CGI was impressive at some times and unwatchable at others. When crew members fell off the bombed out ships, they flew in parabolic arcs. Now I don't expect animators to be physics majors, but I would like them to have seen something fall. The ""Top Gun"" gimmickry was hard to take as well. Oh, look at the bad boys. Make sure you remember what they get chewed out for, because it's the secret weapon later on.Moving on to the events of the day. Yes, we were caught by surprise, though new evidence presents intriguing new questions to the debate. Yes, the bases were devastated. Yes, there were signs that any Monday morning quarterback could spot. But, as the attack happened, training took over. ""Pearl Harbor"" depicts most of those caught in the event to be wholly inept cowards. I've since gone back and reviewed some real footage of the event, and watched brave men strip machine guns from crippled planes while under fire, stepping in to take the place of those who are shot. Damage control teams fighting fires as enemy planes strafe. This movie is a disservice to all their memories.""If you want historical accuracy, go to the library"" is what I believe one reviewer wrote. I have two very important questions for that reviewer, and all who believe that. Was Pearl Harbor such a boring event that lies need to be told in order to be entertaining? Did the brave men and women who chose to defend our country at a time when most turned their backs on the events in Europe and Asia need to be portrayed so poorly, and on the day that is reserved to commemorate them? Idiotic scenes of Americana saturate the beginning of the attack; a group of boys playing baseball, a woman hanging clothes on the line. IT WAS 7:00 IN THE MORNING! Does anyone who watched the movie know why Cuba Gooding Jr's character got a medal? I'll give you a hint. It was not for boxing.There are many wonderful stories yet to be told about Pearl Harbor, and CGI can bring that event to us more vividly than ever before, so save your praises for this horse.

I am not old enough to remember any of these experiences and have only been able to understand them through dry documentaries on the history channel or through older family member's personal experiences. The older family members made a point of sticking with the light stories and refraining from reliving the heavier elements of life at Pearl Harbor. I really liked the plot, the acting, and the way the storylines made &quot;real&quot; people out of the statistical analysis of history.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3NPS7CH5NFRWG	Terry Chance	This was a movie worthy of seeing, assuming that you know that you are watching a love story and not watching a lot of history. Surely the action scenes are great and the movie generally followed history. The problem is that they could have done the same love story and not changed the historical facts. In the movie Midway, history was followed almost to minute detail. They did throw in the love story angle and the ficticious hero, Matt Garth (Charlton Heston), with his son falling in love with the Japanese girl. This did not take away from a very good historical movie. Who knows why the makers of Pearl Harbor decided to gloss over much of history? Even the scenes of ships exploding in the harbor were obviously modern warships used as props. I was hoping to see WWII era destroyers and cruisers but no such luck. It looked strange to see modern frigates and guided missile cruisers being bombed by the Japanese in 1941. The bottom line is that they made a good movie and blew the chance to make a great movie. If you want to see history, see Tora Tora Tora!.  If you want a movie with an love story and great computer generated special effects, see Pearl Harbor.	3.0	Good but should have been better.	2001-10-01	3	2	1

They supposedly spent a ton of money to produce this film: the pity is they didn't seem to spend any of it on a script that deals with real people or genuine logic.  I came away from this film actually angered.  This movie asks us to believe that the Ben Affleck character participates in the Battle of Britain, the Pearl Harbor attack AND the Doolittle Raid!  Had the film been 30 minutes longer, he could have taken part in the Hiroshima bombing!  It also asks us to accept as a character a military pilot with a crippling stutter!  I am sure that a person who cannot communicate is the one you want flying as your wingman! I can attest to the fact that such an individual would not have made it past the induction center, much less flight training.  The love triangle bit was cliched when it was filmed in '43 as ""Crash Dive"" and it hasn't improved with age.

As far as entertainment goes its 5 stars but i gave this movie 4 stars because there was too much love story telling more than the actual pearl harbor story. It was a bit distracting when the blood is rushing and flowing in other parts of my body besides my brain, I like the love story, but i feel it overpowered the historical attack on pearl harbor, the Movie is called ""Pearl Harbor"" so I feel it should focus more on the historical facts more than the love story. Also near the end, when the airforce plans a counter attack, it would be nice to see more war and fighting action, but instead it was a sad ending.I am a history major at uc irvine and i learned in one of my classes that there was more depth in why japan attacked pearl harbor. It would be nice if this movie could explain that, but there are too many details to go into as far as japan/usa politics,I had to buy 2 textbooks for that class which covered a lot of material, it was interesting, but also a challenge to read that much. the movie would be way too long, but i wouldn't mind. Basically like the saying goes,"" a good defense is a good offense"". That is basically why japan attacked pearl harbor. But the movie didn't clearly show the reasons for why pearl harbor was attacked, it just jumped straight into: japan attacking pearl harbor and when and where are they going to strike? It would be more interesting to show a story with a wider spectrum of the attack on pearl harbor start to finish, and not focus so much on the love story. As for the love story,I thought kate beckinsale was awesome, but the only problem is that she is so darn good looking that it actually distracted me from focusing on the movie. That is why i give this movie 4 stars because im afraid the may have made a mistake casting such a sexy lady to play the role. shes so darn sexy that I just focus about her and not the movie.Anyway it would have been 5 stars if they did not use such a gorgeous hot sexy woman, i was a little hot and bothered, but for those who arent as perverted as i am, this bluray is an awesome 5 stars for those who do not easily get distracted by beautiful women."	4.0	Great Movie, but could be better.	2010-02-12	7	4	3

They should call it &quot;Pearl HarBORE&quot; (no pun intended)! I rated this movie a 2 just because of the battle scenes. I could talk for hours on how bad this movie is, but I have a limit of words. I just can't get over how someone could like this.

I was expecting something really engaging. Instead I got ""Pearl Harbor"", a movie that isn't about Pearl Harbor at all, but a silly ass love triangle that takes up about 70% of the film!The storyline itself was predictable with the Affleck/Beckindale/Hartnett vapid love triangle, while the Pearl Harbor attack is used as a backdrop...so much of a backdrop, that you had to wonder if this was what this movie was about. You didn't have to be a genius or even a psychic to know how it was going to turn out. I can see that Michael Bay was trying hard to capture the magic of James' Cameron's ""Titanic"", but he failed miserably. At least with ""Titanic"" you were able to connect with the characters; in ""Pearl Harbor"", you don't give a damn about what happened to any of them. Ben Affleck is a truly horrible actor, WHY give him the lead role? That should have been a warning sign that this movie should have been avoided like the plague.The special effects of the Japanese attack were the only thing worth checking out; they lasted for about 30 minutes and were amazing, which is why I gave this movie 3 stars. But the rest of the film will nauseate anyone over the age of 16, so don't say that you weren't warned yet again. Why did Cuba Gooding, Jr. consent to be in this movie and in the film ads? His appearance was wasted. He had no interaction with any of the other cast members, except when Beckindale, who played a nurse, bandaged him up after a fight and after the attack, looking at each other from across a room. He had about three of four lines in the entire film. I know he was supposed to be portraying Dorie Miller, a cook who shot down a Japanese bomber in the attack, but his role was really not important to the plot. Watching this movie, you'd think that African Americans had no role in fighting this war whatsoever, which is historically inaccurate.In addition to Cuba's appearance, Dan Ackroyd and Jon Voight are reduced to making cameos in this film and it makes you wonder if they are hard up for money, because they both had only a few lines to speak in this awful monstrosity and then you didn't see them anymore. Alec Baldwin fared a little better than Ackroyd and Voight; at least he got more screen time.""Pearl Harbor"" did make a lot of money, yes, but that does not mean it was good. It is an insult to every last person who died on 12/7/41 and to the folks who actually lived through it. If you still feel that you have to see this, PLEASE don't buy the DVD or even rent it - wait to watch it on cable. You're paying for the service anyway!"	3.0	Beware of this movie	2002-04-02	0	0	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	The Groove	You'd figure that a movie like &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; would take its subject matter seriously and with some reverence, but we're dealing with producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay, who are notorious for making loud, big-budget, empty-headed action flicks.  Now, I like a popcorn flick as much as the next guy, but &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is as shallow as film making gets.  To be sure, the 40 minute attack is as thrilling as a Six Flags ride, but there's no historical depth, originality, or dramatic thrust.  The film borrows liberally from superior films like &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; and the performances--from actors Affleck, Hartnett, and Gooding, Jr.--are wooden.  Only the lovely Kate Beckinsale radiates some warmth and energy in her performance.  As for the script, I was rolling my eyes every fifteen minutes: the screenplay leaves no stone unturned as it recites every war/romance cliche in the book.  However, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; the DVD is well-presented: the picture is near flawless, and the 5.1 surround remix is the strongest I've heard.  It doesn't surpass &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; but it comes close.  So if you've seen the movie and you know you'll like it, then by all means grab it.  Otherwise, you can find better ways to spend three hours of your time.	3.0	Bay and Bruckheimer learn to stop worrying and love the bomb	2001-12-06	12	8	4

Set a love story against the backdrop of an epic catastrophe and make a mountain of money.  Unfortunately, the formula produced PEARL HARBOR.The love story is beyond lame.  The fly boy characters are leftover caricatures from TOP GUN.  The beautiful nurse they fight over looks beautiful (and she is) but the script gives her nothing else to do.  Ben Affleck looks at least ten years older than Josh Hartnett.  The scene where a riled FDR rallies his war cabinet by rising from his wheelchair is bizarre and laughable.  Casting Hollywood super-lib Alec Baldwin as WWII Jimmy Doolittle is insulting and borderline sacrilegious.  The ending is ridiculous.The 40-minute battle scene in middle of this mess is impressive but the rest is hackneyed and unbelievable.  I'd heard that Disney, trying to cover all the bases, released a version to the Japanese that ended after the devastating attack--so they wouldn't be insulted if we reminded them we ultimately won WWII.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1EB3EO0NZ1LO	The Movie Critic	"I walked into ""Pearl Harbor"" with pretty low expectations and walked out thinking, ""that was just what I expected"". ""Pearl Harbor"" is nothing special. It's just a love story with the attack on Pearl Harbor as a backdrop.To start with, ""Pearl Harbor"" is far too long and it just doesn't have what it takes to maintain interest the whole way through. This is just one aspect that really lets it down.  Another aspect is the cardboard characters. The characters are so uninteresting that you don't feel any sympathy for them and you don't really care about them.I was also unimpressed with the movie's script. I did however get a giggle out of the sheer stupidity with some of the lines such as ""I've given my heart to Danny. But I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you"". Give me a break. How did a line like that get through?""Pearl Harbor"" is a war movie at times and then at other times it's a love story. The movie is greatly let down by these two genres being mixed together. There were even times when I felt that the movie had a bit of a romantic comedy feel to it. These scenes, and others, attempt to add a bit of comic relief, but they don't work because these types of scenes have no place in a movie like this.There are however, some good points in ""Pearl Harbor"". It was good visually from the sets and the scenery, but I thought the strongest point was the soundtrack, which was very good.  I'm not sure how the makers of ""Pearl Harbor"" wanted us to feel after watching it. Did they want us to feel sympathy for the cardboard characters? Did they want to give us a history lesson and have us walk out feeling that we'd learned something? If any of these things are what the makers intended, they didn't succeed. I don't know too much about the attack on Pearl Harbor, but I have read that the movie doesn't give us a very accurate history lesson. The impression that I got was that it's just another movie showing off with millions of dollars worth of special effects of how realistic it can look when people get shot and blown up.""Pearl Harbor"" is just another example of how bad movies are getting. Most movies these days just have their strengths in special effects, impressive camerawork and big budgets and nothing else. For a movie to be successful, it has to have strengths in all aspects such as characters, story line and atmosphere. ""Pearl Harbor"" is just pathetic in these areas.To sum it up, ""Pearl Harbor"" is a big letdown. It was eagerly awaited, but turned out to be a big disappointment."	2.0	A big letdown.	2001-06-24	11	8	3

Henderson ""filmphan"""	I went into this film, knowing that it was going to be a romance first-war second film. I knew that it was going to be another film along the lines of Armageddon, yet I still wanted to see the movie for its spectacular re-creation of the battle. Yes, the 40+ minute battle was stunning, breathtaking and heart-wrenching, yet I was utterly DISGUSTED by the fact that the movie paid more attention to the fact that there was a Jerry Springer-esque love triangle going on! 1,117 men died on the USS Arizona, over 3,000 total were killed at Pearl Harbor. Yet, this horrific and sad fact is burried under 2 and a quarter hours of plot involving two pilots who put their dream girl ahead of their country. The movie, I believe, is a disgrace to those who fought, and died at the battle, and throughout the Pacific campaign. Yes, I realize that this movie had to have a wide appeal to all audiences, but did it have to be this vain?!! If you want to see a well made film about the tragedy at P.H., then get &quot;Tora!Tora!Tora!&quot;, a vastly superior film - both technically and substantially. &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; proved how horrible war is, and how tragic the D-Day invasion was, while at the same time instilling an unbelievable sense of patriotism and pride in America's choice to fight the Nazi's. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; briefly attempts to instill patriotism, but tosses it away for some cheap romantic plot line.

Taking a page from the romance-driven epic 'Titanic,' this film is heavy on the lovey-dovey kitsch early on. Ben Affleck is his usual charming self as a hot-shot pilot and Kate Beckinsale sparkles as a Navy nurse. But the good stuff doesn't start until the middle of the movie, when hundreds of Japanese 'zero' planes descend upon Pearl Harbor like a pack of ravenous mosquitos. The buildup to the fateful 'Day of Infamy' is intense, and the destruction of America's Pacific Fleet is both stunning and catastrophic - a milestone in moviemaking that is not to be missed. But while it is clear that Director Michael Bay (Armageddon) knows how to charm and thrill an audience, he fails to captivate the imagination. The movie concludes with the riveting 'Doolittle raid' of Tokyo. Yet instead of contemplating the tragedy that was Pearl Harbor, the viewer is left with a vacant feeling in the gut and, more importantly, the heart. Sure, we get bucket-loads of 'How it looked.' But this movie is soft in what could have been it's most important attribute: 'Why was it important?'	3.0	The 'OREO' of blockbusters. See it for the creamy filling.	2001-05-28	16	14	2

Many of the more &quot;emotional&quot; scenes that are included throughout the film, however, are not needed and only help with one thing: the viewer's boredom. All in all, though, the action scenes are visually and mentally stunning. They are easily the high point of the film. I mean, let's face it, people like Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer were born to make films like &quot;Armageddon&quot; and &quot;The Rock,&quot; not emotional dramas such as this. Had there been a better screenwriter (sorry Randall Wallace) and maybe a different director that was more accustomed to the type of film that &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; tries to become, this film would have been excellent.

The events of that day mean so much to so many people that the film makers owed it to themselves to make a movie based solely on facts, like Black Hawk Down, and not Hollywood fluff.  The main attack outline is good, but the love triangle developed in this film did not happen, it was only added so that this film would offer something for both men and women.  Making the leading men of this movie seem like heroes that day was a joke.  We were never able to mount an air attack and our pilots did not shoot down 7 Jap planes.  If not for the special effects, this movie would be unbearable.  The acting is not spectacular and Ben Affleck needs to go back to acting school.

Absolutely.  Is this it?  Far from it!  To begin with, a movie called Pearl Harbor should feel some obligation to concentrate on the events of December 7, 1941.  Instead, the movie serves up a ridiculous and uninteresting love story for most of the movie.  In the skillful hands of a director such as James Cameron (as in Titanic), the ploy of using a smaller love story to bring us into the larger story of history can work; in Michael Bay's hands, it fails utterly.  Only during the actual bombing sequence does the movie shine at all, and for a brief moment we see what the movie COULD have been.  Sadly, the best parts of this sequence are ripped off lock, stock and barrel from Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, almost shot for shot (Mr. Bay, you should be ashamed--but then again, you should have retired following the atrocity that was Armageddon).  Low point in the movie:  when Hartnett's character, as the bombs begin to fall around him, calls the airstrip and announces &quot;I think World War II just started!&quot;  Oh, I guess nothing at all had been going on in Europe since 1939--duh.  If you absolutely feel you MUST see this because Ben, Josh, and/or Kate are in it, then do yourself a favor--rent it on DVD, go to chapter select, and just watch the battle sequence.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	ARMAYUEOJBPJD	Thomas Ellenby	I have just watched Pearl Harbor on DVD and found it to be the worst example of Hollywood corrupting history I have ever seen. From the 5 minutes actually spent on the attack on the Pacific fleet (second wave ?) to the Doolitle raid (in an a movie about Pearl ?) taking off in a flat calm from an angled deck carrier (not invented by the British until the 50's) this film more than stretched incredulity. If you know anything, and I mean ANYTHING, about WWII avoid this film at all costs. The premise that two fighter pilots (who shot down 7 enemy planes during the Pearl raid according to the film ??) would be asked to become multi-engine bomber pilots is beyond farcical. How the producers managed to get this piece of crap past the top brass is beyond me. The strange thing is that at times the effects were stunning. The SGI shots of the Oklahoma capsizing were amazing. And yet we would still see shots of modern Spruance class cruisers with obvious pyrotechnics on deck purporting to be WWII warships. In short, after much anticipation I was VERY disappointed. If you want to see a film about the attack on Peal Harbor I would recommend Tora Tora Tora. By far the better film.

In spite of the cheesy dialogue, the movie is surprisingly pretty engaging.  That is a sign that there are alot of good things going for it.  The script does have its (very few) moments.  The acting is good for the most part, and of course the action and special effects are outstanding.  But I do agree that the movie seems to be trying way too hard to be emotional and moving.  Alot of unnecessary scenes are in this movie just to make the characters look cool (like slow-motion exits from planes through smoke...with a flag in the background...i mean...come on).  Of course I was hoping this movie was going to be a great oscar contending war movie or something.

What DISRESPECTFUL, historically inaccurate TRASH this is. To use the title name as they do and show no respect to the veterans and who died there.

This movie, Pearl Harbor, will simply waste more than 3 hours off your life. Like one reviewer said, he wished he could purchase all the DVD copies in the entire world and burn them. Really bad. The historical inaccuracies are beyond words. No one plays little league baseball at 7:30 am on a Sunday morning. Nuff said!If you are thinking of purchasing a gift for your father or someone you know and love who loves WW2 history, I know it's tough because you have to find something they have not already seen right? The best recommendation I can give is search Amazon's National Geographic collection of Robert Ballard. These have a before and after thing going on that is excellent.

A day on which director Michael Bay released his latest assault on the senses. A day in which producer Jerry Bruckheimer makes yet another calculated attempt to release the blockbuster of the summer.""Pearl Harbor"" begins in 1923, in rural Tennessee. We meet Rafe and Danny, two great friends who have dreams of fighting in the war. Flash forward to early 1941. Rafe and Danny (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) are training with Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) at an airfield on Long Island. Rafe and Danny should be about 30 at this point, but Rafe comments that he is 25. During a physical, Rafe falls in love with Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), a nurse. Naturally, Evelyn falls for Rafe. He is, after all, a dyslexic fighter pilot who folds origami swans. I'm not kidding. Rafe accepts a position with an elite flyer squadron in England and leaves Danny and Evelyn together. They are soon transferred to Hawaii. Flash forward to December 5, 1941, Rafe...Oh, enough of the ludicrous love story Bay, Bruckheimer and writer Randall Wallace have perpetrated on the public. Be warned. They make you, me, us, sit through 90 minutes of the melodrama before the actual attack. Throughout the film, we are occasionally `treated' to voiceovers by Evelyn and Rafe reading their letters to each other. Fingernails on a chalkboard.Memo to Ben Affleck: Take your copy of the book ""Facial Expressions for Every Occasion for Every Actor"" with you to the next film. The audience should not laugh when you are trying to convey that your character is hurt.Each of the characters is surrounded by a group of stereotypes. Unfortunately, they each have one or two moments, not nearly enough to help them become memorable. The stuttering fighter pilot has a moment of comedy. The young nurse with the big glasses is just amazed at the size of the world. The pretty nurse is a tramp. And so on.Cuba Gooding Jr., Colm Feore, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore and others pop up in what amount to extended cameos. Gooding Jr. thrusts his chin out. Feore is wasted. Voight and Baldwin make the most impact. What a waste.These fine actors are wasted because the entire film, all three hours of it, is about Rafe, Danny and Evelyn. Remarkably, Bay makes even the Pearl Harbor attack about them. The attack takes place and we watch planes attack ships, airfields, people. We watch ships sink. We watch torpedoes do their job. Throughout, Rafe and Danny are racing to an airfield, to find a plane to use. They manage to get into the air and shoot down seven planes. Evelyn rushes to the hospital and has to decide who gets help. After the battle is over, Evelyn and Rafe have `the talk' which you have been expecting for some time. Evelyn says that she didn't know Rafe would come back. ""Then you came back on the 5th and all of this happened."" The `this' she is referring to is the attack on Pearl Harbor. The attack when much of the Pacific fleet was disabled. The attack when many people died. But it sure inconvenienced her love life.The attack sequence has some impressive shots, but ultimately it fails to conjure any emotion. Because we know so little about any of the characters, we don't really feel a lot of emotion for them. A couple of things are mentioned, rather than shown, robbing the film of some heart-wrenching sequences. Film is a visual medium. Don't describe an action.There is one thing I am thankful to Michael Bay for. He has slowed down the editing a bit. ""Armageddon"" was a collection of five second shots, strung together to form a narrative. In ""Pearl Harbor"", he slows the editing down, but he still edits far too much. As soon as he shows someone, he gives us only a few moments to get used to them, before cutting to another angle of the same person. Let us live with the character for a few moments, Michael. Give us a chance.Also, we have no sense of place in the film. Where did the planes come from? How did everything happen?This film is already being compared to and critiqued against ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Titanic"". It wants so bad to be both films. The comparison to ""Ryan"" is evoked by the Pearl Harbor attack. As I mentioned, it has some impressive moments, but it is nowhere near as memorable as the opening of ""Ryan"". ""Ryan"" was rated `R' and stained our memories with blood and gore. ""Pearl Harbor"" is rated PG-13 and has to show restrained images. The difference between the two? One battle looks real. One battle looks like a film. ""Titanic"" was an epic film, using a romance as a door into a historical event. The two central characters are real, alive and we care for them. None of the characters in ""Pearl Harbor"" appears this real and therefore we don't care about the romance. It is merely filler.""Pearl Harbor"" is just not very good. Judging by the reaction of the audience I saw the film with, I am not alone in my opinion. People actually booed at the end. People laughed when Rafe realizes the truth about Evelyn. Many people didn't like this film. If you are looking for a good film, go to ""Shrek"", ""Moulin Rouge"" or ""Memento"" instead."	1.0	"This ""Pearl"" Gave Some Poor Oyster Hemorrhoids"	2005-04-12	19	14	5
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2Y9EI5E0L5A13	Thurston McCallister	I was a History major and really looking forward to seeing a movie about Pearl Harbor.  With all the special effects and Hollywood wizardry they produce today, I could hardly wait.  The trailor made the movie look like a non-stop action event from start to finish.  What you actually got was much, much less.  You got a WWII version of Titanic.  The producers took a very interesting topic (Pearl Harbor) an ruined it by 1)Casting Ben Affleck, 2)Throwing in some cheesy love triangle, and 3) giving this movie an anti-climactic ending with the Doolittle Raid.  It's almost as if the producers couldn't just give the viewer the basic facts and portray what actually happened.  Noooo, they had to throw in &quot;Selling Factors&quot; that would make the movie more appealing to a larger audience.  What you get is a watered-down version.  The best of Pearl Harbor?  Definately the 30-min. scene of the actual bombing of Pearl Harbor.  The worst of Pearl Harbor:  Kate Beckingsale waiting at the airport and, unknown to her, having to watch her loved one being unloaded from the plane in a box.  How CHEESY.  I would have walked out if it were not the last scene in the movie.  Don't waste your money.	2.0	Pearl Harbor: One large disappointment	2002-08-20	11	8	3

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2O0S36N6Z3JEH	Tim	Just a note that i am reviewing this film from an entertainment perspective.(That is why we buy DVDs right?)I believe that this edition of Pearl Harbor was dissapointing only to the extent that it was a two disc set and required me to change discs 2/3 of the way into the film.When we review this movie, we must remember that a movie is constructed very much for entertainment. Yes, it is true that such a love story, is quite unrealistic, but it is essential to the movie's 'wow' factor. Without this love story that so many people play down, the film might as well be a documentary.Movin right along, the film certainly does provide adequate entertainment for a viewer. The main battle sequence takes place in the middle third of the film and lasts for about 40-45mins. This sequence, is constructed superbly by ILM and manages to take the viewer right into the action of December 7. The music to the film composed by Hans Zimmer neatly fits the tone of the film, and adds to the sense of excitement created by special effects.Pearl Harbor is a typical Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer film. One that is created merely for entertainment.The first third of the film, does become monotonous if you have watched the film many times like me, but on your first time round, it is essential in building the relationships between the characters. The middle section as i said earlier is fantastically completed and it is here that i gave most credit to the film.The final third of the film does dissapoint me to the extent that i believe it is a poor attempt to sqeeze in the Doolittle retaliation by the Americans into an already very long film.Overall, the film does deserve 4 stars for the amount of entertainment it provides. After a few times of watching it, this might drop to 3 stars as the length of the film seems to drag the story a bit. (the film is a bit too unnecessary long)However, i believe that this film is a good buy especially for those who have systems compatible with the fantastic soundtracks that it offers (THX and DTS tracks)Also, don't compare the film to TITANIC as many do. When watching a film, really, you shouldnt be comparing it to others. Pretend it is the first film you have ever watched and just enjoy it. =)	4.0	A movie is for entertainment right?	2001-12-10	0	0	0

Doesn't Bay know it was sunk at Pearl Harbor along with the Battleship Lusitania? And what was with that Dr. Doolittle raid? Dr. Doolittle was a Canadian zookeeper, not a bomber pilot. And it wasn't an air raid that devastated Vietnam after Pearl Harbor, it was Texas-sized planet killer asteroids dropped from stealth planes. Didn't Bay see ""Final Countdown""? And when did Ben Affleck become, like, a fighter pilot? They could at least have given him a jet plane, or used Tom Cruise, who is a real jet pilot. Other than these ridiculous hitorical innaccurasies, it was a great summer blockbuster film! The sizzling chemistry between the two pilots was amazing and heartwarming. Cuba Gooding was fantastic as the black sailor, OMG OMG OMG I didn't even know they had black people back then (and I'm not alone on that one ask any white person)! I watched this with my grandmother and she agreed there weren't any black peeple at the time too, so this film is HIGHLY progressive too.=== SPOILER ALERT ===Basically it was about like, these totally cool people, like Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett and all these geeks, who were like, foreign or something and totaly evil dorks who can't even speak english. Then the cool people like totally kick the their geek Vietnamese butts. We'll be renting this film for decades to come.Sure it wasn't highbrow, but that isn't what films are for.

This film took on a subject near and dear to the hearts of Americans everywhere, and failed to do it justice.  Fantastic explosions and effects and a quality score from Hans Zimmer could not resurrect this movie from the stench of mediocrity.A tacked on love story was butchered further by the B-level acting ""talent"" of Ben Affleck, but one gets the sense that, even perfectly done, it would not have worked against the backdrop of the terrible attack.  It would be like the soldiers on Normandy Beach stopping for a romantic tryst halfway up a sand dune.The movie also played out about an hour too long.  The last hour (all AFTER the attack on us) just pushed my opinion of the movie lower and lower.All that said, I did mention that the movie had solid effects and a wonderful score.

Don't listen to all the people who trash this movie just because about the romance it has in it. They have to ask themselves one question.  How the heck could this movie be made without some kind of plot??? The director couldn't just have the actual attack in the movie and then boom, it ends. That would only be like a 10 minute movie or something. So yes, a plot, story, and fictional characters have to be used in order to actually make a ""movie."" Without them, there wouldn't be no movie. Just like the major disaster epic ""Titanic,"" of 1997, it had a romance story behind it. So what that a man and woman somehow fell in love in just the course of a few days or so on a gigantic cruise ship. Without the romance story, there wouldn't be the great movie Titanic that we came to see in 1997. Instead, there would just be another documentary like if you will recollection of the tragic demise of the ship. So after all that I have said, just truly enjoy this film for the romance, action, suspense, and breathtaking effects it has.  Alot of people just will never be able know a good darn movie when they see one, and isn't that a shame. All in all, Pearl Harbor is truly a war epic!"	5.0	Truly a War Epic!	2005-09-26	21	10	11

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2ASJ0IHIAOUW8	T. Laxson	I'd heard this movie put down so much that I opted to not see it in the theater. I will admit that Bruckheimer films have a tendency toward prefabricated robotic scripts and melodramatic direction and acting; however, despite the consensus of the other reviewers, this film strays as far from those faults as it possibly can.To begin, I find it quite amusing that no one giving this film an unkind review is able to give specific details of melodrama or clich&eacute;d plot or any other significant fault. So, to avoid that lack of credibility, I am going to actually explain why this movie is good:It seems fairly taken for granted that the special effects and action sequences are of superior quality, and such minor facets of film as a whole are rather inconsequential, so I'll skip that category. So, what about the plot/screenplay: Let's start with the friendship of the two lead characters. Due to surprisingly authentic acting (accents included), the relationship between Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett's characters is immediately convincing and intriguing. They are country boys, who dream away their childhoods and aspire always for honor and courage. They love each other in a way that is never displayed in American cinema, unless it involves homosexuality.Then we have the extremely sweet, innocent, and humorous romance between Ben and Kate Beckinsale's characters. Despite the commonly held notion, this is not in any way akin to Leo and Kate Winslet's relationship nor characters from Titanic. That film portrayed the old-as-time tale of a girl, who is, against her will, engaged to a man, whom she doesn't love. Those characters knew each other for like a day before they were gettin' their groove on and professing their undying love for each other. Can you say &quot;absurd&quot;? Anyway, the romance in Pearl Harbor does not come anywhere near the ridiculously overdone and unconvincing romance in Titanic. Rather, Michael Bay's superb direction-including cinematography (very dark backgrounds with bright lights on the eyes of the actors), angles (ecu's at pivotal and spiritual moments), editing (fast cuts and slight disorientation to express the &quot;butterflies in the stomach&quot; sense of confusion that love induces), direction of acting (the sense of puppy-love is enhanced by the stumbling and stuttering of both characters), and production values (did you see the sets?)-really makes the viewer feel like a part of the relationship. He also puts a different feel on the relationship by refraining from resorting to sex to solidify their love for each other. For this, I say, &quot;God Bless Michael Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer, and Randall Wallace.&quot;As far as historical accuracy or whatever is concerned, if you care that much about such things, GO TO COLLEGE, READ AN HISTORICAL JOURNAL, WATCH THE HISTORY CHANNEL, TRAVEL BACK IN TIME; don't ever-EVER go see a movie expecting historical accuracy. Although a few--very few--may be &quot;historically accurate,&quot; they can't all be for the simple fact that that is already taken care of by educators, documentary filmmakers, et cetera. You might as well be complaining that the film didn't have enough of Santa's reindeer to please you.On the subject of mental, moral, emotional, or political dilemmas: IT'S A MOVIE-ENTERTAINMENT, ESCAPISM, FUN, ROMANCE, LAUGHS, TEARS, et cetera; it never claimed to be and certainly shouldn't be a commentary on or an exploration of such weighty issues. It's simply a patriotic, exciting, and well-made love story, nothing more, and nothing less. Similarly to the last topic I dealt with, if you want significant dilemmas and character studies or whatever, watch a Merchant/Ivory film, read the Bible, read C.S. Lewis, go to Harvard Divinity School, just don't watch a big-budget American film with Alec Baldwin, Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, Dan Aykroyd, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jon Voight, et cetera. You don't see people attending a Lakers' game expecting to see Peyton Manning bowl a hole-in-one, throw a grand slam, and then fall off of his horse.How could anyone dispute the eye and heart that Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer share when it comes to filmmaking? The film is beautifully shot with low-lying angles, epic camera movements, appropriate distortions of the camera lens and film, gorgeous actors/actresses, lighting that rivals that of Thierry Arbogast, universally emotional music, characters that are developed enough to fall in love with, yet reticent enough to picture oneself in their shoes, and a factual event that changed the course of world history.Most people who don't like this film though probably cheered when Titanic, Shakespeare in Love, and Gladiator won Academy Awards, and they probably all hail Citizen Kane and Metropolis as the greatest films of all time, so that should be incentive to simply ignore them all.	5.0	The whole world is full of idiots!	2001-12-07	3	1	2

I kept waiting for it to get going. then, everything happens in one predictable flury of events and then it ends.The following should be read in the cynical tone intended:This is Hollywood predictability at it's Best. Lets start with The 2 main characters flying playing ""chicken"" getting confused and at the last minute pulling it through for an oh so thrilling near hit. THIS won't show up later in the film, no!ok, then Ben Affleck Dies (hurray!) but, wait. he can't die he's the star and he's only been in the movie for about 20 minutes. Then His best friend, Josh Hartnett hits on his girl!  Didn't see that coming either.  Wow, and the sex scence in the dimly lit parachutes. how freakin' original.  Then Ben comes back and shrugs his pal. how could he after all they've been through together?(I'm using their real names not the charcters names for it doesn't really matter what they're called in the movie. You can  never get past that you are watching Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett, for neither could act enough to make you believe they are someone else)Then the 2 make up the night before the day on infamy. good thing too cause they are the ONLY TWO PIOLTS LEFT WHO CAN FLY AND SCARE AWAY THE ENTIRE JAPANESE FLEET!!!!!After watching the movie I came to a conclusion that it must be in Ben Affleck's Contract that he can not die. He lived through Armagedon(I almost didn't) and here He crashes twice, is shot at numerous times and still out lives his best freind, Josh, who takes a bullet for him goes home and raises Josh's Son and marries the girl.  Josh Hartnett needs a better manager to say he gets to live and gets the girl.And lets not forget the fine acting by veteran actors Alec Baldwin and Jon Voigt  (Alec hasn't done anything good since BettleJuice and Jon Voigt, well Give me Deliverance. Jon Voigt is as believable as Roosevelt as Kevin Cosnter was as JFK. They should of found the guy who played Roosevelt in Annie-the 1981 version)Then there's the carnage done in full hollywood gore. Except the pretty young nurse who just got engaged, she had time to get her hair and makeup done before she died.This movie was beyond Terrible. They made Pearl Harbor look like a victory for the USA. WE GOT OUR [REAR ENDS] KICKEDIf you going to Write a romance around a war. create a war or keep it accurate and don't name it Pearl Harbor.As for editing. It was supposedly up for and possibly won an oscar. I found it choppy and at one point where Ben is holding Kate with her head on his shoulder. the cameras jump back and forth from different angles to find Kates head on a different shoulder in each shot.  So much for the academy's keen eyes for this sort of thing.  The editors should of chopped off about an hour. That may of made this movie a bit more tolerable or at least not be as much of a waste of time.I really hope I gave enough away to keep anyone who hasn't from watching this.I wasted Three Hours of my life. I don't think the war lasted as long as this movie did. By the middle of the war, I was laughing. Anyone who found this movie surprising really needs to get out more.

It attempts to replicate the Titanic formula, in that it wants to re-create an event of historic importance, and tell a love story with an attractive young cast that will draw in the kids.Unfortunately the love story is a bore, and the attractive young cast is largely inadequate to the task of making me give a damn about what happens to them. Ben Affleck grins his way through the film, but Josh Hartnett seems unconvinced that he has to do anything other than stand around and look pretty. Kate Beckinsale is completely forgettable.The only memorable thing about the film is the attack on Pearl Harbor itself. To be fair, parts of the sequence are impressive. But unfortunately, they have come after an extended love story of appalling banality, so that it is rather hard to care about which of the characters lives or dies. Indeed, I rather found myself cheering on the Japanese. Please bomb Pearl Harbor, I thought, if only to wipe these jerks off the screen.	1.0	...	2001-06-04	1	1	0

It makes without question the best action films anywhere and in more recent times it has been turning out good films on more serious subjects.This film however is not one of these. It is like a parody of the worst faults that can litter American films. The one redeaming feature is the high quality battle sequences but they only go for about 30 minutes.The film is basically a romance film based on cliches so ancient they haven't dared to raise their head since the 30's. Man meets woman, falls in love and goes to war. Everyone thinks man dies in war, woman takes up with man's best friend. This results in a bit of sexual tension which is resolved rather brutally towards the end.From a historical point of view the film is hopeless. It overates the importance of the Doolittle raid to pander to the nationalism of the American audience. It suggests that American air force personel could drop in to England to fight the Hun for a while and then head back to the states to get into the Japs.From memory didn't joing the armed forces of a country invovle a little more commitment?The most dissapointing aspect however is the artificial and contrinved love story. The dialogue is painful so it rests entirely on the screen magnatism of the leads to create some audience interest. They are physically attractive people but the lines are so deadly the first hour and a half of the film drag dreadfully.Yet this could have been such a great film.

The movie has an excellent plot and a love story that is NOT stupidly intertwined like many.  The cinematography is unlike any other movie ever made.  It is totally different and exceptionally incredible!  The movie is three hours long but I was on the edge of my seat with my mouth hanging open the ENTIRE movie.  The acting is awesome and the special effects are truly amazing.  I advise everyone to go see this movie in the theaters while you can because you will be impressed.  DO NOT listen to Roger Ebert who says this movie was horrible.  He doesn't appreciate the patriotism and honor in this movie.  I give Pearl Harbor a profound 5 stars and I will go see it again for sure.	5.0	Could Very Well Be One of the Best Ever	2001-05-25	2	0	2

I must admitt that before I saw it I felt it would be a long, dragged out, and boring movie. But once I sat down and watched it, I was very glad I had. It makes you laugh, cry, and keeps you on the edge off your seat for a couple action scences. It demonstartes what a horrible and terrible tradegy Pearl Harbor actually was. The acting in this movie is very well done. The filming in this movie is great. The special effects are wonderfully done and it makes you feel like you were right in the middle of the bombing. Teenage girls may be attracted to this movie more than others, but it is still a great movie for everyone. The war scences satisfy the hunger for action; the love triangle plot fufills any romantic's need for love. The history illustrated in this spectacular movie is one of tragedy but demonstrates te true strength of america. I suggest you watch it and make your own personal decision, but in my opinion Pearl Harbor is most definatly worht the 3 hours and 3 minutes.	5.0	Pearl Harbor: one of the greatest movies of 2001	2002-01-01	3	0	3

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A26PCTV7JTC11X	Trader Mort	The only resemblance this film has with the 1940s, is the old and dated storyline. This movie is a maudlin tale wrapped in what is supposed to pass as history. Throw in an excess of special effects, shake well, and you have this disaster.The love triangle between Rafe, Evelyn, and Danny is mind numbingly vacuous, and none of the characters manages to generate interest. The writers must have been targeting teenage females, since I don't know of anybody who would take this sappy mishmash of boy one meets girl - boy one is reported KIA - girl hooks up with boy two - boy one returns alive - girl gets pregnant with boy two's child - boy two is KIA - etc., seriously. Who wrote this stuff anyhow?Dorie Miller's story is clumsily grafted on like a second head, and it seems as if Cuba Gooding Jr. really has nothing to do. Jon Voight is better than I expected as FDR, but the politically correct ending rang as hollow.This movie disserved Pearl Harbor and WW2 vets by sanitizing Imperial Japan's motives for attacking Pearl Harbor, and presenting Jimmy Doolittle as a foul-mouthed Cro-Magnon. Some of the battleship sets were impressive, but the excessive computer special effects made the combat scenes seem like nothing more than an arcade game (planes flying between ships on Battleship Row? Come on).If you want a decent film about Pearl Harbor, watch Tora, Tora, Tora. If you want to watch junk, then this film is for you.	1.0	Pearl Harbor, bombed again	2002-11-08	10	8	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A35ZK3M8L9JUPX	"TREND700 ""TREND700"""	On a sleepy Sunday morning in December as children played and families prayed, squadrons of Japanese war planes screamed across the skies of a Hawaiian paradise and launched a surprise attack on the U.S. armed forces at Pearl Harbor--the infamous day that jolted America from peaceful isolationism to total war and altered the course of world history. The story focuses on the life changing events surrounding December 7, 1941 and the war's devastating impact on two daring young pilots--one from the U.S. Army Air Corps, the other from the British Royal Air Force--and a beautiful dedicated nurse, with whom both of them fall in love. It is a tale of catastrophic defeat, heroic victory, personal courage and overwhelming love set against a backdrop of wartime action.

Campbell ""srvngdaddy"""	A film based on one of America's darkest hours, Pearl Harbor, is not one of any true value. The plot consists more of a crappy love story, then of any historical importance. Even with its strong supporting cast including Ben Affleck, Josh Hartinett, Jenifer Garner, and Kate Beckinsale; the story's poor character development and uncaptivating performances hinder enjoyment of the film. If I had to pick some decent part in the film, I would have  to  say it's when they show the devotion of the troops to defend the country after the attack, and near the end when the bombing run of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is shown. Other than that this film is nothing more than a waste of time and money.	1.0	Hurl Harbor	2006-12-04	5	3	2

Michael Bay does not create &quot;art&quot;. Pearl Harbor is an amalgam of every big movie we've already seen over the past five years, from the obvious rip offs of Titanic and Saving Private Ryan to the more subtle ones from ID4 and yes, it's true, Forrest Gump. He may learn after this that standing on the shoulders of others to make more money isn't a good idea without the talent to use it. It's very sad that he had to abuse such a tragedy as Pearl Harbor to satisfy his need for a money making machine. Stay clear.	2.0	Ouch	2001-05-26	2	2	0

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A5CWLQF6QO3CN	"Tso Haven Hei Wan ""Havenough Dupont Randall-B..."	An historical movie built on incidental romance among three young actors and actresses. The story is very predictable as it is one of the main stream historical war romance triangle movie. What would you expect the result would be when two brotherly good friends fell in love with the same girl and then it was during the war time? The answer is obvious and simple.The screen play is very good, it captured all the good sceneries and the soundtrack is also very good. Nonetheless, the soundtrack could only make you feel good with the pictures. So probably you need to go to the theatres to enjoy the full impact of the music. Ben Affleck is still Ben Affleck in the movie. Being the leading actor in the movie, you could expect the director giving him all the best shots (sometimes really look weird and pretentious, though he really looked good in those shots, but those shots are really out of context). Kate Beckinsale, though being the leading actress, didn't really have a lot for her to act. Her role is still crucial in the movie, but it was just because her supporting role for the two boys was so strong that sometimes you would feel sorry for her, because her existence really depends on the existence of the boys. Josh Harnett's role is more or less similar to his role in Here On Earth. The same good guy next door guarding a girl whom he loved without asking for reward.  However, it would be a rising movie for him for he could earn all the sympathies from the girls in the theatres (the bunch of girls were crying their heads off in several occasions for him, could believe that!) Basically, all of them really look extremely good in the movie, especially for Kate, she really look gorgeous in some shots. Michael Bay really knows how to put his actors in their best posts and looks. Also, there are quite a number of good supporting cast, look out for surprisingly good supporting actors (they do have a name in the industry but they were not in the posters!).The special effects are really outstanding, considering you need to shoot so many people died in different occasions and places around the Pearl Harbour area. The war scenes are spectacular, not as blood shedding as Saving Private Ryan, but you could feel the heat of the war through out. In some scenes you could really feel the horror that was brought over by war. The imminent sense of death, the sudden lost of people you know and the struggle against death. They could all stun you in your seat.The movie is not that &quot;Big American&quot; although you could still see the American flag here and there or between changing of shots. For the part about the Japanese, poor acting skills should be expected. Also watch out for weird Mandarin and playful stuffs against Hitler.In all, Pearl Harbour is still a very enjoyable movie, at least you won't feel that you are in the theatre for 3 hours already when you leave the auditorium.	4.0	Good effort but the story is too simple and predictable	2001-06-08	1	1	0

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A4N0TPLM7RFFL	Twyla	This is one of the best films of this proportion that I had seen in a long time.  The Director, Michael Bay has done a superb job of creating a realistic setting of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  The actors do a wonderful job of portraying characters who may have lived during that time in history.  Ben Affleck plays Rafe McCawley, Josh Hartnett is Danny Walker and Kate Beckinsale plays Evelyn Johnson.  The three main characters become involved in a love triangle unknowingly, the two men are in armed forces and she is a nurse.  The war scenes seemed realistic and all the while the love story was still engaged.  This film brought back a lot of emotion for people who had not forgetton this tragedy.  This movie aided younger Americans in connecting with generations who had lived during this horrible period in time.  I feel this film has not received the credit it is due unfortunately.  I wish this film would have preceeded Titanic, maybe then it would have received some much deserved honors.  I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in war/history films or just plain love stories.	5.0	Award Material	2002-10-20	3	1	2

It is not &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. People time after time give new war films no credit because they are not as gritty as SPR. SPR was a new level of intensity in war films. It is however, unfair for people to expect every war film from now on to be as graphic. I can tell you now, no war film will ever be like SPR. It just won't happen. This film is good. It has elements of classic war films in it because it combines action/combat, and romance. I don't think it was meant to give all the historical details of the attack, like &quot;Tora Tora Tora&quot;. It was about how the attack changed the lives of a small group of people on a personal level. It is about the people, similer in theory to &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;. This will someday be a true classic of the war film genre.	5.0	A great war film!	2003-01-30	6	0	6

Where Saving Private Ryan had its realize and showed the dedication of soldiers, this has ben affleck trying to prove he's a real actor.  No matter what anyone else tells you, Affleck will never be a good actor unless he's playing a tuff guy from Boston with his buddy Matt Damon.  Beckinsale's performence is equally out of place as she tries to fight past her english accent and become a big time hollywood actress.  Why exactly Cuba Gooding Jr. was even in this movie still boggles my mind.  The role he plays should have been for a up and coming african american actor, not an established one who wants to boost his career.  Over all this movie besides its faulty acting, is an insult to anyone who took part in the attack on Pearl Harbor.  I would be affended to think that what happened that day wasn't interesting enough and needed to be beefed up with a cheesey romance novel quality love story.  So boo to the people that made this movie and wasted so much money that could have been spent on something truly worhwhile.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	ASJ89T42CIUHU	V. Marshall	If you are interested in watching two films in one this is the film for you. Hollywood has butchered a significant moment in history and what could have been a powerful film.Somehow the writers of this movie must have been trying to convince us of the errors of war without letting the horror of the bombings in Pearl Harbor speak for itself. Instead they threw in a horribly sappy romance movie in the midst of such tragedy. While I have no doubt that many of the people involved in the real Pearl Harbor were in love and beautiful, I have my doubts on whether or not &quot;love&quot; was the first thing on their minds during the attack. I also have my doubts that one woman could fall in love with two men who are both drop dead gorgeous and extrodinarily brave at the same time. Reality proves time and again the impossibility of this sappy romantic notion. This portion of the film should have been written out and left for the &quot;Lifetime&quot; network to promote!Now for the good part.....this film will have you on your seatbones during the battle scenes. It will rile your patriotism and inspire you to learn more about the actual event in history. The special effects are decent although some of the harbor scenes are obviously fake. But the horror of thousands of sleeping men being awakened to war is tragic. To even begin to fathom being buried in a sinking ship is horrendous. I wish the movie would have pulled a bit more at our heartstrings by focusing on true stories of what these brave men endured to survive such an event rather than just the magnitude of the bombings. This is where movies like &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; reign supreme and this one fails.I recommend this movie purely for its ability to inspire you to learn more about the actual attack.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1ECF4HZLRYY4Y	"Volkswagen Blues ""cead1"""	"What I am about to say will sound drastic, but I am not hyperbolizing when I assure you that ""Pearl Harbor"" may look pretty but is one of the worst films ever made. It is historically impoverished, offensively imbalanced, and egregiously derivative, borrowing spent and hackneyed motifs from one war film after another. This DVD presentation merely highlights the film's inadequacies, and I can't possibly warn you away from it vigorously enough.First of all, history seems to have run a distant second to unbelievable drama in the making of this film, despite Bay's pretensions to the contrary. I have no problem with Bay when he makes shoot-'em-ups like 'The Rock' that take an incredible fictional scenario and turn it into a couple of hours of diversion. But here he's flagrantly tampering with the history of our nation, and he's done it a grave disservice. The best example of this problem in the film is the portrayal--or rather the lack thereof--of the Japanese preparations for the attack. Bay is far more interested in spinning out the implications of the rivalry between Hartnett and Affleck than in actually looking at how and why Pearl Harbor happened. This is especially frustrating when films like 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' have done this so much better.This preoccupation with romance to the detriment of history is symptomatic on a much larger scale of movie-making that cares less about reality than it does about blowing stuff up and bedding the love interest (and thus perhaps it is also analogous to the way we Americans tend to take our place in the world in general, oblivious to what's really going on until it hits us over the head in a very shocking and tragic way). The Japanese are nowhere in this film, regardless of the little featurette Bay includes in this DVD purporting to offer 'the Japanese perspective.' We get a few nuggets of wisdom from Admiral Yamamoto, but can we really care in the filmic world Bay has created, where the Japanese are never really given any identity? One minute they're using subtitles, the next they're writing letters with English voice-overs. It's obvious that the film doesn't care about them, and thus we don't either. Again, other films have done this balance far better.Finally, there's the annoying feeling that we've seen all of this before. The bullets through the water? Spielberg's ""Private Ryan."" The undisciplined trainees in flight school at the outset? 'Top Gun,' anyone? The final bombing run (yeah, right)? Remember 'Memphis Belle'? Bay not only gives us stuff we've seen before, but he doesn't even do it as well or as coherently. And Randall Wallace, who turned out a wonderful screenplay for 'Braveheart,' can't make anything come together here. It's just a shame.But it's not the worst shame. Beckinsale's final voice-over, as the camera pans the wreck of the USS Arizona, reminds us that 1,177 men--American soldiers--call the hull of that boat their final resting place. 1,177 men. And Michael Bay's film, with all of its convenient inaccuracies and forcibly misplaced triumphalism, is an affront to the memory of every single one of them.And to those who cry, ""Lighten up!  It's entertainment!"", I have this to say: How many years will have to elapse before you will sit back, relax, and want to watch a lightened-up, entertaining movie about September 11th, 2001?  That's what I thought.  Historical tragedy that entertains is simply an offensive concept.  We deserve better, and so do the men and women who died at Pearl Harbor."	1.0	Overwrought, underthought and an offense to American history	2002-01-06	11	9	2

If I could give it zero stars, I would.  The reasons it is awful have already been covered in detail by many reviewers, and suffice it to say that a third-grader with only a single ""60th Anniversary of Pearl Harbor"" magazine article could have written a script that was more factually accurate and--yes--more entertaining.  Not even Shakespeare could fashion a tragedy as awful, complex, and heart-rendering as the actual story of Pearl Harbor.  Apparently Michael Bay et al., suffering delusions of grandeur, decided that they could improve the story...this travesty of a film is the result.  Sadly, too many people will watch the film and, not knowing any better, will assume that this is how it actually happened.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AZ6ABK0FWURBX	Warren E. Domke	"In all fairness, I haven't seen the DVD or VHS versions of Pearl Harbor--I paid ... to watch it on the big screen and was frankly embarrassed that I paid good money to see an overly-hyped cinema spectacular that had everything except cinematic merit going for it.From the first scene where a Stearman biplane is seen crop dusting--an unlikely scenario, since the Stearman was not built until nearly a decade later, not to mention the unlikelihood anyone was cropdusting routinely that early due to the unreliability of airplane engines--to the scene where Ben Affleck takes off in a Hurricane and gets shot down in a Spitfire (the crash no doubt a result of his changing planes in midflight)--to the scene where President Roosevelt ""stands-up"" to show anything is possible, this movie was a disappointment to me.What's wrong with getting your facts straight?It isn't that hard.  After coming down from a rolling boil after seeing ""Pearl Harbor"" I got out my trusty VHS copy of ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" and watched a real movie on the same subject.There were chances for the directors to pull something out of their butts and resurrect this turkey, because they did do some rather nice special effects, and Cuba Gooding was a believable and very ably portrayed Dorie Miller--but they had him firing the wrong kind of machine gun--Dorie Miller fired a water-cooled deck machine gun, not an army field machine gun.  It is correctly depicted in ""Tora, Tora, Tora.""I may be a knit-picker and I may be a quibbler and a trivia nut, but it's not that hard to get it right.  In fairness, many good war movies have some scene inconsistencies--even such outstanding flicks as ""12 O'Clock High,"" which drew heavily on actual combat footage.  We forgive them because they make it up with a meaningful plot with a message.These directors tried to do for Pearl Harbor what Jim Cameron did for Titanic--they need to borrow Jim's thoroughness and integrity the next time they try something this ambitious.  They need the honesty and soul-searching done by Spielberg in ""Saving Private Ryan.""This could have been a truly outstanding movie.  It wasn't.  I will not be wasting more money on it unless maybe I can find one in a pawn shop ..."	1.0	Pearl Harbor?  Is that where you can go pearl diving?	2002-07-24	6	3	3
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A22AIAFY9X5D00	Warren V Thoms	Historial Content Vs Hollywood..... The association of the two puts me in two minds..i mean sure, war buffs like to see directors and writers take that extra little step in being as accurate as possible...especially when recreating an event such as Pearl Harbor...but as far as im concerned, you cant criticize a 'film' for not being historically accurate...if so, we'd all be watching documentary's on the history channel instead of enjoying a night at the movies...Perhaps the love side of the story was a little over powering...as was the normal Ben Affleck type ending but you cant criticize either of those two points as there was 'love' in war ..and there was also 'life after war'..look at the classic 'Midway' for instance, although it wasnt on the same level as Pearl Harbor, there was still a sensitive side to the script..which i feel you need to achieve in order to preserve the true atmosphere of war..after all, the fighting man did little more than fantasize about his girl for as long as he could stay alive....hollywood just feels the need to push too much of it through the screen at times.... I saw the movie twice, which is something i do with the movies i enjoy...i must say that Pearl Harbor failed to touch me in a way that 'Saving Private Ryan' did ..perhaps that's due to the fact that D-Day to me, was a far more moving episode of war than Pearl Harbor itself. All comparisons aside, there were some brilliant scenes in the film ..none better than the Spitfire - ME dogfights over Dover...talk about goose bumps...Almost as good were the B25's taking off from the 'Hornet' and the Japanese Flak batteries during the 'doolittle' run over Japan.. For those scences alone i was contempt with the content...The attack on Pearl Harbor itself didnt do much for me ...some of the special effects were a little too 'special' ..if you know what i mean...However, any movie made in the honour of those who took part in the actual battles wins my approval ..perhaps in the future, we will see a movie which boasts both the stunning visual and sound affects and which contains all the necessary factual historical content...keep the war films rolling hollywood..	4.0	Tora Tora Tora	2001-07-08	5	3	2

There is only a maximum of 1,000 words that I can write here, so I will not even begin to list all of the historical inaccuracies in this movie.  Frankly, you could write an entire book on that. I also will not talk about how stupid and drawn out the personal storyline is, which has NOTHING to do with the event for which the movie is named. I study East Asain history and World War II. I am constantly in touch with veterans on both sides.  All I can say is that this movie is pathetic in its portrayal of a very important event.  Has our overly patriotic and romantic view of America's past come to this sad display?  I hope that children do not grow up seeing this and thinking it has anything to do with reality.  I have heard people saying that this is just a movie and that beating it over the head with history is pointless.  The fact is, it represents itself as history.  They even opened the movie at Pearl Harbor and had the stars dressed in U.S. Navy garments.  Movie have an effect on the collective perceptions a culture has about an event, whether we like it or not.  This is an insult to one of the bravest generations of human beings all over the world.  Micheal Bay, Ben Affleck, and everyone else involved with this movie should be ashamed.  They owe an apology to everyone on both the Japanese and American side of WWII.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3CFT5LHFCB46K	"""weirdo_87"""	I have not seen the movie Pearl Harbor since it first came out in theaters back in May 2001 and hadn't intend to write another review for it. But after a recent experience, I could not help myself from writing another review.Recently, in my history class, we were discussing about how Hollywood changes events in history to make movies more entertaining and commercial. One person brought up Pearl Harbor, asking if Hollywood messed up the history or not. If I weren't so in control of myself, I would have gone off on that person! I told him that why should an important event in world history be toned down for a PG-13 rating and why we pay to see a three-hour love story that should have been a war movie. Being in a classroom full of MTV Generation morons who wouldn't know good movie making if it smacked them in the face, I was told by several people to shut up. But whose has the last laugh.Pearl Harbor, admittedly, is entertaining. But shouldn't this event in our history be taken seriously? This could have been as realistic and brutal as Saving Private Ryan, but sadly it's battle scenes solely relied on CGI graphics, making it look more like a big video game. Then again, this is Jerry Bruickheimer and Michael Bay we are talking about (The same duo behind such loud summer movies as The Rock and Armageddon). Also, since it was unrealistic towards the attack, it defeated another purpose of the producers; to encourage young people to study more about the attack and to fin out the real truth behind the bombing. If that student in my class had read a book on the attack, he might not have asked if the movie was unrealistic.There are several other problems with the movie. One of the big ones is the reasons why Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. In the movie, the only reason given was that the U.S cut off fuel supplies and trade. Japan decided to show the U.S not to mess with them.  If one were to study up on the attack, they would realize that Japan was invading islands and lands in the pacific. Thus, the fuel that the U.S was providing would have been used for the wrong purposes. The Japanese, who launched the air strike and thus brought the United States into war don't even have a big role in the movie. Even the title place of the movie doesn't have a big part, being only the mere backdrop for two young lovers. It is almost like using the World Trade Center, that is, on September 10, 2001.One might call me a hypocrite, for I trash a movie like Pearl Harbor for lack of combat accuracy and praise something like The Longest Day, which has some inaccuracies in its view of the D-Day landings. But one also has to know that these movies were made in two different time periods: The Longest Day came out in 1962, a time when censors had more control over film content and thus wouldn't permit Longest Day's producers to show a bloody D-Day landing (This was also the era of the war epic). Pearl Harbor, however, has been released in a time of more leant censors and could have been the definitive movie of December 7, 1941. Instead, it was only made as the ultimate M.M.M (MoneyMaking Machine). When will Hollywood learn to stop cashing in on the dead?	2.0	The Pearl Harbor Bombing: Hollywood style!	2001-12-10	0	0	0

Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) have always been best friends, and have both always wanted to be pilots, since they were kids. Although Rafe has always been the one looking out for Danny, trying to protect him, it was Danny who tried to help him hide his Dyslexia and pass the eye exam to become a navy pilot. It was at this physical exam that Rafe met Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), the navy nurse who ""passed"" him. They fall madly in love. But, four weeks later, Rafe is off to England to help fight Hitler. This is an assignment he volunteered for. Although he and Evelyn are now worlds apart, he wants so much to make a difference. He has no idea how much of a difference he will make, for himself, Evelyn and his country.Meanwhile, Danny and Evelyn are both stationed at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Seems too good to be true, being sent to such a paradise. The Japanese are planning to annihilate the American's entire Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor.This isn't just another history film. It's a love story between a man and a woman. It's also a love story between to best friends. Critics say there is much historical error in the film. I'm no history buff, I just enjoy great films. ""Pearl Harbor"" gives the audience an excellent inside scoop of how the Japanese planned their surprise attack so perfectly and how they gained inside information. The attack scene on Pearl Harbor was vividly portrayed and extremely fast-paced and intense. The photography and special effects were amazing. We saw the action from all angles: from the ground, the sea, the air, on the streets, in the hospital. The brutal devastation was all around. The slow sinking of the capsized USS Arizona showed similarities to ""Titanic"" with awesome visual effects. All of the men in the water, the men trapped inside the hull, entombed there forever - what a tragedy.The acting in ""Pearl Harbor"" was a blessing and the actors chosen for each role lived up to every expectation. Affleck can do no wrong in my book. Hartnett and Beckinsale, both strangers to me until now, both gave stunning performances. Other great stars, like Tom Sizemore, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Alec Baldwin and Dan Ackeroid lent a hand in the success of this film. The make-up on the great Jon Voight was so well done, I almost didn't recognize him as President Franklin D. Roosevelt.Alec Baldwin's character encourages his men: ""Victory belongs to those that believe in it the most, and believe in it the longest.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A28O71KZ4H9X22	Wendy	The movie, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;  is no doubt a must-see.  Although it was kind of slow, and not to mention lengthy, the plot still developed perfectly.  Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett played charming young men from the countryside.  Eversince him and Josh Hartnett were friends, Ben has always felt obligated to protect him.  The film incorporates love between two significant others, and a lifelong friendship that's almost torn because of a girl.  Typical?  Yes, it may sound like so, but this flick isn't quite like the others.  Being careful not to give away too much, the film really at first takes your breath away with the charming romance... then it makes you shed some tears because of a misunderstood tragedy... angers you because of betrayal and lastly... it makes you sad all over again.  It does, however make you feel prideful and patriotic about being an American.  Although I offer no offense towards any of the opposing countries that we have fought, this movie really makes a person proud to be an American.  I surely enjoyed.  Many female viewers liked the movie because of the handsome men- Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett.  Although I must agree upon that, I still think the action was pretty great.  Even though the movie was long, it was still great because it kind of mixed in both feelings of Armageddon and Top Gun.  If you still haven't seen this movie, I most definitely recommend it as a movie to go watch with your sweetheart.  I'm sure both genders will enjoy it very much.	5.0	A Flick Fit For Both Men and Women	2001-05-29	4	2	2

After seeing the vastly superior ""Tora,Tora,Tora!"" I was looking forward to seeing the attack on Pearl Harbor done with today's special effects.Unfortunately they had to throw in one of the most ridiculous love stories ever set in a war film.The plot has to do with two childhood friends who join the Army Air Corps. While going through a physical, Ben Afleck falls in love with Kate Winslet. He then volunteers to go help the British as a fighter pilot and is subsequently shot down and presumed dead. Josh Hartnett (Affleck's best friend)  falls in love with her and after months of not hearing from Ben she falls in love with Josh. Ben returns and he and Josh have a big fight...Anyway the attack sequence was the most exciting part of the movie, it looks and sounds great if you have a home theater and a big screen TV, but if you want to see the sequence in it's entirety I suggest you go with the Vista version it's quite a bit more graphic and would have probably earned the movie an R rating (those folks at Disney probably would have hated that!) as well as all the bonus materials they include:An interactive timeline of the events leading up to pearl harbor.Deleted scenesBlooper reelSeveral documentaries on making the filmA great set of post cards with the actors that look like old war postersProduction diariesThe stars at boot campAnd much more....So if you've got almost three hours to kill and want to see a great action sequence get this set and just chapter skip to the bombing."	3.0	Not the worst war film ever made but not the best either	2006-09-22	1	1	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A1MIXULEDRNVBP	"William R. Sample ""wsample"""	Unfortunately I believe this movie tried to cash in on the success of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.  Unfortunately it failed.  As in SPR, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; used actual events but the story line did not concentrate on the events before and after the attack.  Rather it chose a weak love story theme that ruined the film.  Yes the attack scene was dramatic with some artistic license taken but it was still good.I think that this tried to be a cross of &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; and &quot;Tora, Tora, Tora&quot;.  My advice would be to get these if you want a love story and a war story.Watch &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; and take it for what it is, a movie, and not a pseudo-historical account.	1.0	It was a good thought.	2001-12-01	3	2	1

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A38BC2TD8J618M	"""wowous_darcen"""	"The Pearl Harbor DVD (60th Anneversary Collector's Edition) stands out as one of the best DVD presentations I've seen in some time.Before I continue with my review, I should note 2 facts:1) I did not like any of the previous films I've seen by the duo.2) I visited Hawaii for two weeks in August, including Pearl Harbor.The Movie: When I first watched the movie on my television (without surround sound), it was EXTREMELY hard to hear. The dialouge was soft to begin with, and then these theatrical geniuses took the ""Tennesse"" theme and blasted it 100 decibles louder than the dialouge. However, I'm told with surround sound it is excellent in terms of sound. The sound quality is impressive however. The movie itself does drag quite severally in the beginning. I was expecting it, from reading other reviews of the movie when it came out, so it wasn't as bad. But still, it was like throwing an hour and a half of ""Casablanca"" in front of ""Die Hard"". Think about it.Then Dec 7th rolls around. The tension leading up to the bombing is magnificent. The huge numbers of warnings both noticed and unnoticed lets you understand why ""military intellegence"" is an oxymoron. The battle scene itself is everything you've heard about it, and more. It's absolutly the best single battle I've seen in a movie. It's about 45 minutes long too.The rest of the movie is actually intresting, they shy away from the love story finally (Which even is in the battle near the end), and get into a very intresting military documentary type of movie. I enjoyed this segment almost as much as the battle.The end, is predictable to say the least. I was cracking up near the end as the infamous ""I'll do this to save you but I'm going to end up getting killed"" motion was played about 20 times back and forth between the two main characters in the matter of about 30 seconds.The historical inaccuracies in this movie are not only bad, but extremely noticable. FDR's Sept 8th Joint Session speech, for the most part, is Wrong. He simply did not say some of the things that were put in the speech in the movie. My grandparents who were around during WWII nitpicked for the first hour and half all the innacuracies. This shouldn't be used as a teaching material about the WWII era in the least. Not to mention there were no Hawaiins in the movie. You'd think with a movie named ""Pearl Harbor"" you might see some. THREE STARSThe DVD: (Menus) The menus are well done. Simplistic, yet they have beautiful pictures of WWII aircraft and Hawaii running in the backround, along with the nice musical theme.(Chapter Selection) There are about 45 chapters in the movie, which makes it easy to switch the battle scenes to watch again.(Making Of) The making of segment is nice, and long, its intresting to see how they made all the ships tip over and stuff. I didn't know that the movie actually was taped in Pearl Harbor which was intresting.(Music Video) There's a Faith Hill music video of ""I'll Be There"" on the DVD. I'm not particullary a fan of her music, but it has excellent video and sound quality.(History Channel Documentary) This is another 45 minute feature about the Heroes of Pearl Harbor. In other words: ""How The Characters in the Movie Were Ripped From The Headlines"". After seeing this, it's like watching an episode of ""Law and Order"". You know it really happened. The expand quite a bit on how the real life people the characters were based in. I enjoyed it. Again, this was difficult to hear with soft dialouge.(Nat'l Geographic Preview) I don't know what this was supposed to be, but it was basically a ""Buy the Pearl Harbor 4-DVD set coming out soon"".(Trailers) I left the trailers to last because quite frankly, they are some of my favorite trailers to date. They were not only well done but emotional and have high replay value.The Teaser Trailer is about 2 minutes long, and features various shots of planes flying around and bombing Pearl Harbor, with the REAL FDR SPEECH in the backround (You know the one: ""December 7th, 1941, a date which will live... in infamy."") this is my favorite of the two.The Theatrical Trailer is as well done as the teaser, and is a bit longer. This trailer also incorperates FDR speech, but it's done by the actor who plays him. This one actually uses some of his Fireside chats. Most of his lines come from his meetings with advisors such as ""How long can we pretend that we're not at war?"" and ""Does anyone really think we can win a war without losing life?"". It shows some of the more upbeat pre-war scenes of the movie, but leaves a good portion to the battle itself. Well done, but I like the first better. 5 STARSIn Review: Movie = 3 StarsDVD = 5 StarsOverall = 4 Stars: Excellent DVD, Decent Movie.Suggest Viewing: Teaser Trailer, Theatrical Trailer, History Channel Documentary, Pearl Harbor Movie, Making Of Pearl Harbor, Music Video, History Channel Documentary.

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3O536E2YOKK4Y	Wuchak	"""Pearl Harbor"" (2001) is a Titanic-ized version of the tragic events of Pearl Harbor -- a fabricated drama/romance hooking the viewer into the deceitful attack of December 7, 1941.It's 85 minutes before the attack occurs so the dramatic-romantic part of the story BETTER be good, and it is -- and it's believable too (except for the premature sex part, which inaccurately transfers modern sex morals to the early '40s). This first act successfully brings us back to the era of the early '40s and sets the stage for the attack. I didn't think there would be any action until the big attack but I was wrong, as we see some quality action when Rafe (Ben Affleck) goes over to Europe to fly for the British. Believing him to be dead, his girlfriend (Kate Backinsale) and best friend (Josh Hartnett) spend a lot of time together and naturally develop a relationship; but ***SPOILER ALERT*** Rafe miraculously survives, which leads to some more action ***END SPOILER***.Many criticize the acting and dialogue of the drama, but I found nothing wrong with it. In fact, I found it quite well done and realistic. For instance, the film shows that Danny (Hartnett) was abused by his father while growing up. Later while dancing & drinking Evelyn (Beckinsale) comments to Rafe how shy Danny seems to be while Danny is shown just sitting at a table too shy to talk to a girl or ask someone to dance. Rafe responds that Danny is like a brother to him, that Danny's father abused him and he therefore lacks confidence. This is REAL, my friends. Much later, after it is believed that Rafe is dead, Danny goes to Evelyn's apartment fumbling & stumbling to ask her out. The conversation is, of course, awkward. He then walks away, speaking under his breath, ""You're such an idiot!"" This is good, realistic stuff.The film also shows that the timid average-looking man (Danny) can win the heart of a beautiful woman just as well as the confident handsome man (Rafe). It's simply a matter of passion, patience, risk, humble pie and playing your cards right.As for the Pearl Harbor attack, it's a full 30 minutes of great war footage. Critics argue that there are many historical inaccuracies in the film, but what? -- Go ahead and state them. Seriously, what is so historically inaccurate in the film? I'm sure there are a few minor inaccuracies (maybe Jimmy Doolittle's boot laces weren't right -- Oh my God!!), but what film ever has everything 100% right? They for certain got the gist of the event right, what more do you want? Get a life.You want accuracy? The subplot with Cuba Gooding Jr. as the winning Navy boxer Doris Miller is a true story. Research it, it's a fascinating story.The film is also respectful of the Japanese' viewpoint as they plan, prepare for and carry out their attack. I felt this was generous on the filmmakers' part since nothing can justify their deceitful and cowardly assault. They spoke with forked tongue of peace while planning the unprovoked aggression.There's also a great scene showing the Japanese pilots the night before the raid, praying and psyching up for the attack. It's very realistic.After the attack I knew there was a good 50 minutes left in the film so I was apprehensive regarding the remainder of the story; not to worry, though, as this final act compellingly details The Doolittle Raid, the first American bombing mission over Japan. More great war action.I never even knew about this bold bombing mission until I saw this movie. It took place a mere 4.5 months after the Pearl Harbor attack on April, 1942. The raid is notable in that it was the only time in U.S. military history that bombers were launched from an aircraft carrier. 16 modified bombers with five-men crews successfully bombed 10 military and industrial targets in and around Tokyo. Unfortunately this was a one-way mission and they were forced to fly to mainland China to land, crashland or bail out, IF they had enough fuel, that is. Most of the Americans made it to China and safety with the help of Chinese civilians and soldiers. They paid dearly for helping, however, as it is estimated that the Japanese killed 250,000 Chinese, vengefully searching for Doolittle's men! What evil bastages!! Incidentally, Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle is greatly portrayed by Alec Baldwin in the film and, true to history, the picture shows Doolittle taking part in the daring mission. More historical accuracy.Some criticize that the Doolittle Raid doesn't belong in the film, but nothing could be further from the truth. If all the movie showed was the Pearl Harbor attack and the immediate aftermath it would've ended on a real downer. Showing the successful Doolittle Raid makes the film end on a positive note. What effect did the raid have at the time? It caused American moral to soar from the depths to which it had plunged after Pearl Harbor. It has the very same effect on modern viewers.CONCLUSION: In light of all the criticism I kept waiting for ""Pearl Harbor"" to stumble and fail, but it never happened -- there's not one misstep. Yes, the viewer has to be open to and patient with the opening drama/romance as it leisurely unfolds, but this just helps make the viewer CARE about the characters before the tragic events inevitably occur. I'm not a fan of Michael Bay. I d have zero interest in seeing the ""Transformers"" films, but this is fine movie-making. It provokes interest in the events and inspires the viewer to research them in more detail.GRADE: A"	5.0	A Fine Drama/Romance Combined with Great War Action	2004-11-11	7	4	3
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3MFRIOLO36IDZ	"W. Wren ""piddleville"""	No, it's not a great film, but it's a lot better than some would have you believe. Essentially, it's a 1940's style war film interspersed with 2001 special effects (like explosions). This means patriotic verbal expressions and images, and a less than obsessive sense of historical accuracy. But (despite the marketing) that isn't the film's point. It's a romantic fantasy and a very good one at that. If you expect more from it, then you'll be disappointed in it. But I don't think this is a fault with the film. It's the fault of the expectations we bring to it, and a brow-beating marketing campaign. If you want to compare it to something, compare it to &quot;From Here to Eternity.&quot; It's in that genre of films.  While not a great film, it is certainly a good, entertaining one. And for a long movie (183 minutes), it flies by very quickly.Oh, and relative to the other DVD blockbuster movies this year (like Phantom Menace and Planet of the Apes), this is the hands down winner. At least you'll stay awake.	4.0	Better Than You're Led To Believe	2001-12-16	2	1	1

If you don't mind watching Ben Affleck cry then you'll love it. The battle scenes in Europe are highly dramatized (although the actual Pearl Harbor attack was quite detailed IMHO).

I was reluctant and was in no mood to spend the evening with a war movie. And as it began I was disappointed and bored by the oft-repeated theme of a love triangle. But soon the war took over the screen and it was delightfully real and profoundly moving. The gross realities of world war II Pearl Harbor unfolded before us. The brutality and the terrible loss of lives involved were depicted with necessary detail. It provided a history lesson which the American youth should know. I was happy that I went. And the gruesome war scenes got stuck in my memory. Indeed it is a worthwhile movie comparable only to 'The Titanic'.	4.0	A Great War/Romance Movie	2001-06-04	7	4	3
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AEGBJ94DCVH5Y	x_bruce	"While far from historically accurate and not even much of a good love story you get a lot of mishmash in Pearl Harbor. While nowhere as annoyed as many reviewers and accepting that films take license with reality Pearl Harbor was an acceptable film.The acting is neither terrible nor good, split right down the middle, probably more to do with directing than acting. The script can't decide if it's a love story or war film although by the trailers and teasers it appeared to be a war film, especially as the press junket tours indicated.That is the biggest problem, deceptive marketing.What Pearl Harbor reminds me of is 30s and 40s war films brought to technicolor and with lots of gloss in modern Hollywood style.There is good news with the DVD sets however. The material including two History Channel documentaries, the cursory making of documentaries and much more are uniformly excellent and provide more insight and entertainment than the film.To conclude. Based on your acceptance of how films are made you'll love or hate it, or if you can get out of technical mode and just watch Pearl Harbor for entertainment you'll probably feel you saw a decent film. If you're a history buff you will be offended and if you're a love story fan you will probably be annoyed to some degree with all this annoying and gory war stuff going on. It's easy to understand the outrage some history and war buffs have and they have every right to be angry at being marketed by a film that is half romantic fantasy - and not as horribly realized as some make it out to be - but edited or scripted poorly. I suspect editing but have to give all negativity to the direction of this film. It is the director's job to give a film it's tone, it's character and to do so by making decisions about what kind of story to tell. Unconventional writing isn't a bad thing, three act books, plays, films are often the stereotypical kind of things many people object to here.Pearl Harbor was made to make money and anyone who thought otherwise is foolish. Films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" are the exception to the norm, they are great films - period. Pearl Harbor is war story lite.Th main reason to buy Pearl Harbor, especially the 4 disc set is for the documentaries and shorts that do a vastly better job of telling the story of Pearl Harbor. They are less ponderous than Pearl Harbor, the film.Film: 2 1/2Extras: 4Print to DVD: 4"	3.0	A good argument for the DVD format	2003-04-23	3	3	0
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A2AIBEDH9DFI9P	Xoandre	Fresh from the theatre, I feel so robbed with this movie. However, I enjoyed it.  The war scenes were obviously toned down a lot and the back story brought to the front. They tried to make it an interesting plot within the backdrop of Pearl Harbor. The story and characters were believable and well-acted, but what threw me all the way out of the movie was the unfortunate choice they made as a symbol for connection and affection: Japanese oragami. Every time I saw the oragami birds that two of the characters held on to it [made me mad] and distracted me from the emotion of the moment. Other than that, the only problem I had was the over-simplification of the ending and that they did NOT show the A-bomb drop. I know this movie is about Pearl Harbor, but it leaves you in the middle of the war and rolls the credits without doing anything to wrap it up besides some meager voice-overs and a few scenes of conclusion that leave you hanging. I have no problem with the toning-down of the violence except that the camerawork and editing in the midst of battles leaves you wondering what is happening. No overviews of where the planes are in relation to each other, no continuity in the war scenes and the explosions (even the big ones) were lacking in effect. Of course, the theatre I attended to watch the movie had the sound cut out every 20-30 minutes briefly for thirty seconds.  They should have cut out the scenes with Dan Ackroyd and enhanced the ones with explosions. These scenes were negligible and akin to those one would find as deleted scenes on the DVD. Sound editing was horrible as well; the explosions were minor booms compared to the sounds of, say, The Phantom Menace, where you actually felt the shock wave. Pearl Harbor is a good movie with many flaws. Biggest mistake: oragami - a Japanese art created by an American pilot in the middle of a war against Japan. Best effect: the first chicken run. If they had intensified the sound of explosions and cleaned up the blur effect in the hospital, it might have been better. If they had done something with the Atom Bomb drop over Hiroshima, that would have been a more complete ending to the movie. My recommendation: they should have just re-released ID4.	4.0	They did not complete the story...	2001-06-10	3	2	1

What a pity that they had to be wasted on this pitiful excuse of a movie!Much like ""Titanic"" which preceded it (for which the above paragraph could apply in its entirety), ""Pearl Harbor"", rather than being a great movie about a historic tragic event, offended the viewer by using the event merely as a backdrop for a ""chick flick"" plot...and a very POOR one at that.I truly looked forward to this movie, believing the writers and producers would show this event the respect it deserved. So sad that the remaining WWII vets get THIS as a ""tribute"". What an insult! One can only envision the next step being a romance story called ""9-11: The Twin Towers""."	1.0	What a waste	2003-09-01	37	28	9
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A3KO3Z8JFUXVW7	"""yarsk"""	In this movie, there could have been more information regarding the Japanese persepctive of things; it would make the movie more educational and more interesting, more historical, perhaps.  However, this is not about &quot;Pearl Harbor.&quot;  This is a romance/relationship set against the movie &quot;Pearl Harbor.&quot;  The relationship could be true to a certain extent, but the acting runs off a little cheesy and corny, for me.  It's like the newest movie on the Titanic catastrophe; it's a corny romance set against the Titanic catastrophe, but there is only certain information that is interesting about Titanic, and it's the same with Pearl Harbor.  I wish the movie would be more realistic and historically correct and you know what I mean.  However, FDR was done very well, and the bombing was done incredibly well.  It was fabulously breathtaking.Thank you very much, and I hope you take my advice seriously.	3.0	The &quot;Titanic&quot; of the Pearl Harbor catastrophe...	2001-06-13	4	3	1

It has a good story line. The 90 minutes of Pearl Harbor are outstanding. If it hadn't had so much love story and more history it would have been better. Josh Hartnett did and Affleck did perfect. Even though Cuba Gooding Jr. didn't have that big a part he did great.See the movie, it rocks.	4.0	Don't believe the reviewers	2001-05-26	2	0	2
B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	A24JDJQWQDDH14	Yu Narukami	"Pearl harbor the movie is an embarrassment to our grandparents. This film was clearly about the money and effects. If you are trying to learn history, do not watch this film, it's inaccurate in every way. My 8th grade teacher actually showed us this film, no joke. If I were you, I would watch TORA TORA TORA! Does more justice to WW2.Story: An ugly mess, I'll give you some inaccurate events. Due to the obvious difficulties in obtaining antique machinery, some of the military equipment does not exactly match the period, and dates from later in the war. Some of the ships and aircraft were built long after World War II, or have equipment added by their present owners - antique planes and warships are even harder to come by.-Air conditioning units can be seen on top of the White House.-Evelyn and her nurse friends are shown wearing bikinis. The bikini didn't make its first appearance until 1946.-The Japanese zero aircraft depicted in the film are green, even though the ones used in the real attack in 1941 were painted grey. The Japanese Navy didn't paint their zeroes green until 1943.-In the beginning of the movie, we see a newsreel of 1940, showing a US tank fighting in the city of Cologne. This did not happen before March 1945.-After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Danny and Rafe are seen boarding a C-47 transport which is to take them to their destination where they will train for the top secret mission. The C-47 used, clearly has a radar dome mounted in the nose. C-47s of this type did not exist in that time frame.-When Rafe and the other pilots are attempting to reach their planes, he tells them that P-40s can't outrun Zeroes, but can out-turn them. Not only is this information untrue, in fact the truth is quite the opposite, but how would he know this information? The Zero was only introduced in 1940, and very few, if any, Americans had ever seen it in action before Pearl Harbor.-The ""Battle of Britain"" scenes take place in early 1941, but the battle ended by the end of October 1940. The Germans still bombed the UK until 1941 but only at night-At that time, Japanese was written from right to left. All the Japanese characters in the movie are written from left to right, except one phrase, which says, ""Empire of Japan banzai"".-Rafe explains to the pilots, that are going to fight the Zeros that are strafing the airfield, that ""P-40's can't outrun Zeros, so we're going to have to out-fly them."" He has the aircraft capabilities backwards. In level flight and especially a dive, the P-40 can outrun a Zero any day. On the same note, a Zero can fly circles around a P-40. Pilots fighting the Zero in the P-40 were told to use ""zoom and boom"" tactics, diving on Zeros and racing away. If a P-40 pilot ever tried to out-fly a Zeros superior maneuverability, he'd be dead.-In the scene where President Roosevelt is expressing his dismay with the Americans not doing more to aid the Aliies in Europe he mentions that the US needs to send more tanks to Britain and Russia, to provide aid. At this point in time, early 1941, Russia was still an ally of Nazi Germany. They didn't start fighting on the side of the Allies until after the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 and were not considered part of the Allies until January 1942.Those are just some inaccurate events, as for the usless story, It's a Sunday morning on December 7, 1941. After being presumed dead during the Battle of Britain, Capt. Rafe McCawley struggle in his relationship with Nurse Lt. Evelyn Johnson, as well as his best friend, Capt. Danny Walker, who is also taking a shine towards Evelyn. Whilst this is going on, Japan are planning a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. This would've been interesting, if they had left out, or at least toned down the love story.Acting: This may be some of the worst acting I have ever seen, Ben Afflect's fake accent was so bad, I don't even know what accent he was attempting. Kate Beckinsale at least tried, she should have known better though before taking this role. Of course there were couples at the time, but they didn't have to drag out the romance, I want to hear more about the history.Special effects/CGI: The CGI was great, and that's about all you get, they spent all their money on the attack scene when they should've been spending more money on the historians.Michael Bay: You need to stick with horror remakes, because your original films are awful. Stephen Speilberg should have directed this.Final Word: A complete waste of time, it's all about the money. If you want to see a better historical film, watch World Trade Center, not this crud. To all you history lovers out there, including me, you must know this film is inaccurate in every way. This is a type of film that should be remade, with better writing, and directing. If my grandfather had saw this, (sigh). Disgrace!"	1.0	Pearl horrible	2013-01-06	9	6	3

B00003CXTF	Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]	AH82LVIW332S6	Zombiefan1212	The title makes you think this is a movie about the bombing of Pearl Harbor. It is not. This is a movie about a couple of young fighter pilots that end up falling in love with the same woman. They just happened to be at Pearl Harbor when it got bombed. Even worse, Michael Bay does not use a lot of facts. He had our two main stars go on the mission to bomb Japan, when in reality the two pilots did not go.For most of the movie, it's just some stupid love story. One guy loves a girld. They think he dies, and the guy's friend decides to jump on her. Eventually, they find out the guy's not dead, and a fight gets out. That's most of the movie.Being the 141 million dollar film that it was, there are a lot of great angles, and very realistic CG effects, but not even that can save the film.Ben Affleck has got to be one of the worst actors ever. He's so dull. How the hell did he get the part? I know there are much better actors out there. Why did they get him?Overall, this movie is just not entertaining.I don't know if they like to tell kids this, but America cut off Japan's oil. All the kids at my high school didn't know that.I was there to see the filming at Pearl Harbor, and I could have been in it, but they didn't need me.	2.0	Pearl Harbor?	2004-10-17	5	3	2
