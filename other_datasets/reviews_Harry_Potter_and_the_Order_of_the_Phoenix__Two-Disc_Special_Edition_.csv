B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1ALOIPRR8Q06J	"2 cents ""meaningless memes"""	"After three and four, this fifth installment is disappointing. Order of the Phoenix is too short and leaves out a little bit too much. Make that way, WAY too much by serious fans of the books, but when isn't that the case? At times the viewer is not provided with background and significant details which would make the story more interesting and sensible. All of these movies seem to made with an assumption that everyone has read the book. This movie should have included more and that it was shorter running than previous adaptations is inexcusable and the wrong decision by the filmmakers. This fifth story leaves you eager for six and seven while making many people concerned about the choice of David Yates (director of Phoenix) to be director of all three. However, what is very promising is Yates's desire to do the seventh and last book as two seperate films in order to do justice to the story.I had a problem with the bluish tint seen in much of the movie and that sort of digitale film look, I guess you could call it. Hagrid's giant half-brother was just sad. I mean, how could they accept that result? It's acceptable by mid-90s standards. Maybe they figured people wouldn't care.There are a few things that stand out in this movie, however.I liked the Department of Mysteries. You wondered what it would look like on the screen and it did not disappoint. Dolores Umbridge is evil incarnate. She is one of the most horrible, disgusting, unlikable, disturbing villains I've ever seen. Most of the time villains, particularly in the movies, are famous for having the best lines and great style. They have a stricking apperance and often more personality and charisma than the heros. Not the case with Dolores Umbridge. She has none of this going for her. No great lines but some slightly memorable ones like she confesses, ""You know, I really hate children."" That squeaky voice, the knit pink oufit, and torturing kids... It's Big Brother in pink with a bad hair-do as your worst nightmare teacher from grade school and ""a cross between Margaret Thatcher and Hyacinth Bucket""(The Daily Mall). Well, truth is she is not as horrible as Margaret Thatcher. All the performances are good. Gary Oldman is great as Sirius Black as is Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. She is the embodiment of the twisted, evil, cackling witch.The obvious highlight and climax of Order of the Phoenix is the battle at the Ministry culminating in the epic duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort. Out of all the wizard fights I've seen portrayed in the movies, this one was the most impressive. It was fierce and conveyed the two masters awesome abilities without seeming cartoonish or leaving you feeling like your favorite character was short changed. (I umm, have a couple movies in mind here. You guess what they are.)"	3.0	Harry Potter and Big Brother	2008-08-18	2	2	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AP0K8XE7AIIVZ	ABP	I was interested to see how the movie makers would translate a huge book into a feature film and agree with many that they lost most of the feeling as well as much of the story arc.  Alas, that was bound to be the case.  But the casting of new characters was good in that the new actors were all accomplished without being overpowering.Having enjoyed the actor/director interviews and in-depth behind the scenes footage in the previous movie releases, particularly #3, I found myself highly disappointed with the bonus material on this release.  There was a feature with a whirlwind of 10 second interviews stitched together with old movie clips to replace the actor/director interviews.  The Tonks tour was cute, but very shallow.  There were far fewer deleted scenes than previous and none of them helped in capturing the emotion that would have underlaid the plot or given additional insight.  And the movie editing section was rather silly.  In short, the material was lacking.  While I would understand that if the producers wanted to do something different for the bonus material on this release compared with previous ones, they went too far the other way.  It seems like they could have at least done some real-time commentary on a few scenes.So keep this DVD in your collection.  But be prepared to fill other people in on the plot after they watch it.  And don't spend the extra money to get the bonus material.	3.0	adequate	2008-03-08	1	1	0

Daniel Radcliffe has matured tremendously as an actor, and his performace during the possession scene, in particular, is chilling!HOWEVER . . . I have a bone to pick with Warner Bros.  I want to see in-depth interviews with the cast.  The interviews on this DVD are minimal.  I loved the ""Trailing Tonks"" feature when it was on the movie set, but you didn't need to spend so much time in the canteen!  The extra scenes should've been in the film itself - some of them added a great deal to the meaning of the film.  And I read about ""pop-ups"" the actors took a great deal of time to do, and they only appear in the HD version????  A lot of people aren't buying HD or Blu-Ray players until the HD/Blu-Ray ""wars"" are over and the prices come down!  So why tease us with interviews with Dan saying these pop-ups he did took a lot of effort and show how serious he is as an actor, and then make them unavailable to most of the world???  I am very disappointed with Warner Bros. as a result of this - and the films are entirely too short.  I hope they won't shortchange us on the rest of the films in the series!Overall, the sets, lighting, all the crafts work are fabulous.  But WHY doesn't Dumbledore have any other robes than these stupid pale blue ones??  Those aren't at all like what he wore in the books (he wore brilliant colors in the books with shimmering embroidery that moved!).  And the string around his beard is just stupid.  Gambon does a good job of portraying Dumbledore in this film, much better than in previous films, but still, he isn't so unlike the book Dumbledore, it's sad, and it's all Cuaron's fault for changing Dumbledore's ""look"" in Prisoner of Azkaban.Rupert Grint was wonderful in this film and the new screenwriter finally let him be the hero he's meant to be, not the buffoon Steve Kloves made him into in the last several films.Evanna Lynch finally made me like Luna Lovegood, who never excited me before.  Evanna was a wonderful find - kudos to whoever cast her!  And I loved the Thestrals - they were fabulous!And Dan Radcliffe - he was simply wonderful in this film.I hope Warner Bros. treats the fans with more respect and gives us more interviews with the cast and more features about how the films are made on future DVDs - and doesn't keep special things like the pop-ups exclusive to the Blu-Ray ones! Bad form, WB!!!!  Shame on you!"	4.0	Order of the Phoenix is wonderful!	2008-01-19	0	0	0
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3DGB4HN3QCGAL	A. Burchfield	"Like all of the other movies this one came so long after the book that I can't remember a lot of details but the adaptation seems as ""good"" as any to me. It is, after all, a darker toned story that still managed to get details right in spite of being heavily edited down from book form. ""Goblet of Fire"" seemed to have more color in it if my memory is right, this one is dark and depressing colorwise.The ""extras"" disc is pretty much a waste of time with Tonks tour of the studio being kind of silly, not telling a person much, the editing section was the usual stuff too.I'm waiting for the next movie now."	4.0	"As good as any of the ""Potter"" movies probably"	2007-12-23	0	0	0

Of course it doesn't compare to the book but pretty much all book to movie adaptations are that way.  What shocked me about this was the quality of the video.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1A5KP6KAZM6E6	AC	"I am sorely disappointed in the extras on the 2-disc edition. (I'm not going to comment on the movie itself - you know already if you liked the movie well enough to buy the DVD!)The extras menu is a little difficult to read. Quite pretty, to be sure, but not everyone has a 50"" HDTV, and not all fans are young with great vision. Some of us are adults who need glasses and spend moderately on technology ;) Clearer text next time.I can't get the computer-based items to work (either the interactive ROM stuff or the ""Digital Copy""). All the content is locked up in DRM, and for some reason, my Windows Media Player *can't* upgrade its security and is giving the vaguest of error codes as to why.  So I apparently won't be seeing these items anytime soon. (FYI - if you send an e-mail to WB about problems with the Digital Copy download, you will receive a long auto-reply e-mail that refers you back to their support page. So helpful.)The additional scenes are interesting - but not interesting enough to make up for the lack of cast and director interviews or outtakes.I saw the documentary on A&E; already.  And where is the HBO ""First Look""?  They are usually more fun, if shorter and less content-heavy. I am also puzzled - if you're buying the 2-disc edition, aren't you probably enough of a Harry Potter fan that you know the history and foreshadowing that ties this movie into the overall story arc anyway? Couldn't WB have put something more directly related to the movie there instead of this filler?I liked the ""Trailing Tonks"" extra, but I wish there had been more content involved. It's nice to see the behind-the-scenes stuff, but she didn't cover any production concepts in depth.While I found the ""Magic of Editing"" extra interesting, the game at the end provided me with another little lump of frustration. I really wasn't interested at trying my hand in editing at the time, and there was no obvious way to exit back to the menu - pressing the menu button on my DVD player told me the action was blocked! I had to use the arrows on my remote for a while to find the right hot-spot.Interestingly enough, I bought my copy at a Target store and received a ""bonus"" DVD on building the sets. I haven't watched it yet, but why couldn't WB just put all the extras on the second disc and let everyone see all the bonus material?  That's why you pay extra for a 2-disc DVD set!  Not to mention - if you received this as a holiday gift, then you had no control over where the DVD was purchased.  So if you're lucky enough to have a friend or relative shop at Target THEN you get the bonus material?  That doesn't really seem right.Bad show, Warner Bros. Really bad show. What happened to all the great extras like the ones for the previous four movies? Next time, I'm waiting and reading message forums and reviews before I bother spending extra on extras that are barely worth the time."	3.0	The extras are disappointing.	2007-12-28	1	1	0
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A32ZP0VTRGS0UO	A Customer	First I would like to say that I have several combo disks and have never had a problem with any of them.I thought that the picture quality was better on this HD DVD than the prior Harry Potter HD DVD, which I also own. The sound was also somewhat better than the prior Harry Potter HD DVD.As far as the movie itself my son thought it was the worst of the Harry Potter movies, but I thought it was one of the best, if not the best. Maybe my son was looking for more action than this movie has, while I enjoyed the story and the acting.	5.0	Very good movie.	2007-12-15	8	6	2
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	ASUPBULG49R4S	"Adam J. Nejedlik ""ajnejedi"""	I am very disappointed in WB for not putting out the extended editions.To put the record straight, THERE IS AN EXTENDED CUT OF GOBLET OF FIRE!!!  Every time I watch ABC's Harry Potter weekend they add about 3-4 (or so, never counted) minutes of footage (i.e. Snape in the grounds during the Yule Ball talking with Karkarov and busting a couple in a car, Durmstrang students asking Hogwarts girls to the Yule Ball and bowing, etc)So why is ABC family allowed to show this version if the director said he didn't want to do a director's cut?  He obviously already made one and these versions will be released in a year or two once the Potter Series wraps up and WB feels the need to milk a few extra bucks from the franchise.Nothing in Prison of Azkaban, and I am all good with that, but to not release an extended cut of Goblet or Order when we know the footage is out there is insulting.It's like the Special Extended Editions of Lord of the Rings, or Star Wars on dvd when George Lucas said he would never release the original versions on dvd, i bought the special editions, then two years later had to double-dip to buy the regular editions.Why are the studios so intent on robbing us all blindly?  I own over 200 blu-rays, the format is really only 4-5 years old, and they're already doing re-releases on some of the title I bought a few years ago.  I feel ripped off, and I'm getting sick of it.	1.0	Extended Editions vs Regular Editions	2011-04-27	12	8	4

Too many pieces were left out. I expected to see the hospital seens with Mr. Weasley. I expected more of Fred, George, Ginny and Neville. The seen where Harry was taken from Little Whinging was disappointing. The whole entourage was missing. I did like Luna Lovegood. They should have done more with Professor's Snape's character.I think the first three movies were best. The should bring back Chris Columbus.This movie just feels rushed.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3SZH5F79GKT18	Akimon Azuki	"The fifth Potter movie is not as dark and not quite as funny as Cuaron's No 3, my favourite in the series so far, but it has excellent pace, strong performances, and well written script, plus really outstanding special effects, especially in the climactic final wand battle (rightfully described in the extras as ""Olympic level ninja wandage""). The question is, provided one already has a Blu-ray player or, as in my case, PS3, is the Blu-ray version worth the extra $$? In my opinion, very much so. The transfer has been done extremely well, and the picture is true 1080p, with quality that is outstanding, and it preserves the theatrical version's original 2.40:1 ratio. For once, even the blending in of the green screen fx shots is really good, and there is no trace of grain. And with uncompressed PCM 5.1 Surround, the sound quality, for me the big selling point of these new generation formats, is truly amazing.This version also has a large assortment of interesting extras, and they are presented in high definition as well. In Deleted Scenes, there is footage of Professor Trelawney at the big dining hall table, simply eating her food in very peculiar manner, that is by itself priceless. I also liked the ""The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter"" clips, with some good quotes from the cast. There is also a ""Trailing Tonks"" featurette, an interactive editing featurette, and a documentary called Focus Points. Plus a set of subtitles in just about every language known to Muggles.Overall, this is one of the best Blu-ray movies on the market, both in the content and presentation."	5.0	Magical Potter disc with shiny extras	2007-12-28	3	3	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1VBWYIOZQQIDQ	"Alan Montgomery ""Opera lover"""	The book of Order of the Phoenix is the longest of the series, and yet this movie is the shortest of the 5 so far made.  That sounds terrible, but in reality, although they left out a lot of details, the actual action moves too slowly in the novel.  Still there are several important details left out or changed.  Delores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) is not quite edgy and evil enough - but then that character gave me the most visceral response I have ever had to a character in a novel.The direction is swift and the acting great.  My real problem is with Nicholas Hooper's music.  It does not go anywhere.  There are only one or two decent themes, and the rest is accompaniment in the most noodlie fashion.  I recommend the movie highly, but I hope John Williams returns for the last movie.  (Hooper is already writing Half-Blood Prince).	5.0	Shortest of the longest	2008-01-11	0	0	0

I still wonder how they intend to lead into some of the later plot devices with no set up, but I'm sure they'll throw something together.Though not half as good as the book, this HP movie is still far better than most from book adaptations. Warning though: Some smaller children won't enjoy this, and some may even be frightened.  A far cry from the first two movies, which had a much happier tone.But then, that is a bit of what I enjoyed about this: The progression from innocent childhood to the eventful climax in the last book.

I was disappointed when they laid the blame on Cho, granted they did try to cover it up a bit.  I also felt the firework display should have been grander.  But the wizard battle was good.  Too short, but good!Its a good film for a family to sit down and enjoy together.  It can also lead to discussions about right and wrong as well as to expressing your feelings and emotions and not holding everything inside and trying to do it all alone, as Harry was trying.Good film to add to your collection.

For me, this one seemed like it skipped a lot of parts, and effectively was a noticeably short movie. Perhaps I am just used to long movies, but it did seem like an extra 10 to 15 minutes could have been added to help develop the story. I realize it's difficult to wittle down a book of that size to a reasonable movie time, but I really felt awkardness and undevelopment in this film. Because I have read the book I knew what was going to happen for the most part, but even so I felt there was a lot left unexplained.

However, some essential parts, like the mystery element are completely lost and many key events can only be really understood if you read the book. As such, the movie is a great illustration for the book. Usually it is better to see the movie first then read the book- not so for this movie. Viewing it is like meeting old friends, ""aha! Here's this event"" ""There's this character"", etc.  If you already know what's going on, it's great to see it and what is not shown or discussed doesn't matter because you know it from the book. All the actor performances are excellent and the design is great, not to mention the 3D effects at Imax which are exciting without being gaudy (kitschy). Still, as a stand-alone experience the movie lacks depth, which might explain some viewer's disappointment with it. Could it have been done better?

Trying to put everything in would make a much longer film than most folks would be comfortable sitting through. In this review, I would like to comment on the merits of releasing it in HiDef. I viewed the standard version on the same HDTV (46"" LCD 1920x1080 resolution) with two different makes of upconverting DVD player and both produced a very watchable picture. However, the Dursley's wallpaper pattern seemed to bleed over and at times it was hard to tell which side of the fence Harry was on in the playground. Watching the same scenes on the HD DVD, I was amazed at how much brighter and sharper everything was. The wallpaper no longer dominated the scene and things like the Dementors had clear features. I half expected to discover that the diference might not be worth the extra cost for the equipment and media, but there is a remarkable improvement in picture and sound quality. Perhaps, in the future, the filmmakers might produce a greatly extended version for release on HD DVD. No one would have to watch it all in one go."	5.0	HD makes an amazing difference	2008-01-08	0	0	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AY6QX046HCEAK	Amazon Customer	"Okay, now listen up everyone who's been ragging on the Collector's Editions because the later ones don't include a Director's Cut of the film: there are (mailnly) two different reasons that an ""uncut"" version of a movie isn't made; 1) the budget wasn't high enough to warrant the release of the uncut version (obviously not the case in the HP films), or 2)the scenes that tie the ones that were cut from the final version of the film either were a)not finished, b)didn't survive the editing proccess, or c) not filmed at all because the decision to cut the scene was made before the tie-in was shot. Obviously, in this review, I'm of the opinion that they were unable to incorporate the cut scenes into the main film. I mean, what were they going to do; have the actors re-shoot the missing portions just to incorporate the removed scenes? They're really stretching themselves to come across as the ages they're supposed to be as it is!Anyway, it isn't just Director's Cuts that makes these movies Ultimate Editions (though it doesn't hurt), it's the collectables: the ""Wizard Trading Cards"", the behind-the-scenes booklet, the special removable linticlar card, & special features (such as behind-the-scenes featurettes spanning all 8 films) that you can't (leagaly) see anywhere else or with any other release. That's what makes these releases Ultimate Editions. Would they have been better (& worth more) if they were able to include Director's Cut versions of these movies? Very Likely. Would I still get them even though they didn't? You can count on it!"	4.0	No Director's Cut? Guess I'll live...	2011-05-16	14	10	4

To this end, I do own the first 4 movies on dvd.  I go to see each movie without any preset expectations and I rate the movie based on my own views.  With that in mind, I did have problems with the movie.  It had a cliffhanger feeling.  At the end, I knew that there was more to come, and I was left literally hanging....  There was little explanation about the Order of the Pheonix, as why Harry was left out while Hermione and Ron were in.  The aura of secrecy was never explained.  And while most of the movie was gripping, a lot of background was just left unsaid.  Please keep in mind that there are some viewers who really don't immerse themselves in the Harry Potter Universe and would like to enjoy and understand the film.  I find that Ron's Character fades into the background...you feel that he's there for comic relief sometimes.  Give the actors a chance to expand and shine.  So that's why I only give it 3 stars.	3.0	Cliffhanger Movie	2008-01-26	3	1	2

I'm a little suspicious of those that are always complaining about them. They add a great value and if you compare blu-ray and combo hd dvds, they're only $1 apart.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1Z7V65GIRXPIA	Amazon Customer	Having read all 7 Harry Potter books and seen this movie twice now, I conclude the movies are undoubtedly better than the novels. Why? Because they focus on the important bits of the story (the epic battle between good and evil) and eliminate the extraneous fluff that dragged the series down Book 4 on.Let's face it. JK Rowling was at her best in books 1-3. Books 4 & 5 meandered so much that a good 300 pages could have easily been chopped from each. (Something I thought at the time I read them hot off the press.)I for one am ecstatic the whole Quiddich thing is excluded. Those sequences always distracted from the books by being overly long and dumbing down the drama of Harry's quest. Facing torture at the hands of a sadistic teacher and imminent death from an evil wizard, I doubt the students of Hogwarts would get their knickers in a twist over a silly wizard soccer game. Those sequences belong in children's books to give the 9-12 year olds a break from the important and darker stuff. But the movies are aimed at an older crowd able to understand the angst of a 15 year old Harry.What does this movie do best? It picks up where GoF left off (in a way that minimizes the gaping plot hole left in the books). We have a Muggle world unwittingly caught in a magical war. We see Harry stewing in his enforced teen isolation because the adults think him only a child. We see his peers take a stand and one step closer to becoming recognized adults. (2 years from now they will be considered adults anyway.) Cho's story makes much more sense in the film than the book (breaking up over a friend is the sort of silly thing 12 year olds do not 15 y.o.) Neville gets out all that's truly important about his parents' story. And the finale with Harry, Dumbledore and Voldemort works so much better in this dramatization than the confusing pages in the book.The only thing I can say was underdeveloped was Snape's teen memories. Specifically the bits involving Lily, Harry's mum. But I expect we'll have our chance to see that later in movies 6 & 7.Lastly, having recently finished the final book I think JK Rowling may have been influenced for the better by these movie adaptations. Her 7th novel is written in a way much more conducive to the movie adaptations, with a few chapter exceptions toward the end. It should be a blast seeing this series play out to the end in 2010.	5.0	A huge improvement on the book!	2007-07-28	9	3	6

Gradually small insignificant rights are taken away.  Little by little, freedoms are chiseled away, until there's nothing left.  What was once a carefree life turns into a dark dreary prison-like existence, constantly being watched, reported on, interrogated, and tortured.It takes a few brave souls to stand up and say that they have had enough.	5.0	A powerful central government is wrong	2007-08-09	8	5	3

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	ABRKIJ6D4V42O	"Amazon Customer ""space_hamster"""	My first viewing of this film in the cinema didn't leave a very positive impression. The lead actors are getting better with every film. Daniel Radcliffe is quite the leading man. I wish they'd given Rupert Grint more to do this time around. And Emma Watson is as luminous as always. What didn't work for me was the direction by David Yates. There's no doubting he's a competent director, but there's a sense of humor, flair and verve missing from his pedestrian direction.Fortunately, this film played much better on DVD. There are some great moments in this film. The Dementor attack. Loony...I mean Luna Lovegood's debut. Dumbledore's Army (a well-directed sequence). The battle between the Order and the Death Eaters. The climactic battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort at the end.The biggest problem I have with this film is that it's a series of great moments that can be enjoyed on a DVD. But they don't quite connect together for me to make a truly great film. What saves this film are the performances. The leads (obviously). Imelda Staunton as the odious Dolores Umbridge. But for me, the standout performance for best supporting actress this time around goes to Evanna Lynch. Where did they find this girl?!!? It's as though she fell out of the pages of the book.The other dissapointment with this DVD are the extras. I can't believe they wasted an entire extra disc on such threadbare offerings. We get 4 documentaries. Where are the cast interviews? The Directors Commentary? The spotlight on the new cast members? Compared to the great offerings on the Goblet of Fire disc, it's very dissapointing this time around.Still, if you're a fan of the films then this is going to be one you're adding to your collection, regardless.	4.0	Great moments that make a very good film	2007-12-01	2	2	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AQUVTQFFXP4AC	"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark"""	"The movie was great, not perfect, but great.  You can read all about it elsewhere.This, meanwhile, is my honest, appalled, and feeling somewhat ripped-off review of the Two Disc ""Special"" Edition DVD.Where's the specialness?!  Where's the features?!  Why am I paying up to 75% more for an extra disc over the normal version!?For the sake of continuity with my other HP movies that come with two discs, and not wanting to be left out on the bonus features, I got the Special Edition.The bonus features are laughably minimal, and barely exceeding an hour in full.Magic of Editing: A very short documentary about the importance of editing in a scene, then a stupid game that lets you add music and sound effects to a scene from the movie.Deleted and Alternate Scenes: The totality of these scenes, minus the first one which seemed just a joke for the die-hard fans, added up to maybe five minutes or less.  Would it really have hurt the movie to include them in the final cut?  Most of the scenes were second-long add-ons to other scenes, such as Neville claiming The Daily Prophet really is full of crap after Seamus confronts Harry in the common room, or Harry passing by Dumbledore's office towards the end, and Dumbledore motioning for him to come in.  That's really it.  The first deleted scene was basically just focusing on the Divinations Professor (sorry, forgot her name) during Umbridge's speech to the students in the Great Hall, basically spilling her food, dropping cream in her water, and all in all making an idiot of herself during the entire 3-4 minute speech.  Clearly they had no intention of including this in the movie, simply because of the sheer ridiculousness and complete irrelevance of it.The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter:  Basically just describing Harry's journey through the first five movies, and ""speculating"" on what's to come, as if the books didn't exist.  The introduction tells us that there are clues all over the movies as to Harry's eventual fate with Voldemort, but the documentary didn't bother dealing too much with this.Trailing Tonks:  Possibly the only really fun part of this bonus.  Natalie Tena (who seems perpetually hopped up on caffeine in this documentary) dressed as Nymphadora Tonks (and occasionally appearing on screen as herself, sans makeup, talking about her experience during this scene or that) guides us around some of the set to show us how various things were done, from sound editing, catering, shooting, prop building, set building, and choreography for wand duels.  She also sings a song on a guitar, with a fabulous voice.  Whole thing lasted like 10 minutes.So basically, this ""special"" edition gives you a few random clips and bits of the movie that add nothing more to the story already missing large pieces according to the book readers, a documentary having little to do with the movie itself, Nat Tena giving us 10 minutes of a fun tour, and a stupid little game not even worth playing.  And they need a whole nother DVD to fit this 1 hour or less of content and package it as if it were the definitive version to own.  Clearly not worth it."	2.0	"5 Stars for Movie, 2 Stars for ""Special Edition"" DVD"	2008-01-09	3	3	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A27EH1X1KIK2JA	Andres Escobar	"It is no question that all of the movies on the Harry Potter series are amazing, and so is this one. Harry returns for his fifth year at Hogwarts more much grown up and with much more trouble that he expected, not worrying about losing Quidditch matches, death on a Triwizard Championship, or winning the cup for the year, but he still have some new worries and troubles that will keep him, and you, busy for the rest of the movie.The movie follows Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) one year after leaving Hogwarts School of Wizardry. First dealing with an expulsion after using magic in front of a Muggle when not supposed to reveals some new troubles that have been keeping Harry thinking all summer: Wondering why Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) have stayed out of touch through the whole summer. After a long talk with Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) and everybody else in between, he discovers that people at Hogwarts believe he, and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), are crazy when they says that Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is back. From there on, is just a huge roller coaster for Harry and the only thing he, and his friends, want to do is defeat Voldermort whenever given the chance. Starting with the new Art against the Dark Teacher Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), the ""extensive leave"" from Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), and the nightmares that wake Harry up cold sweating, it is not easy for Harry to deal with his biggest ""fears"". I will try not too give as much on the movie, since each character and ""thing"" make the movie so intense and this should give you a preview on what to expect and I don't really want to ruin it for you, and if you already read the book, then there is nothing I can ruin. Like Harry says "" Even though I am at Hogwarts, I have never felt more alone"", and that should tell you a lot.We have some new and old characters that really make the movie tense. First we have Dolores Umbridge. She is the most arrogant, meanest teacher that plays part at Hogwarts. She will make you hate her until the last minute, until then off course, she is taken away. Her pink clothing, her cold punishments, and her fancy office, make her the most annoying teacher ever to walk the halls and classrooms of Hogwarts. She is the one that denies all of Harry's accusation towards Lord Voldemort being back. Second we have Sirius Black, who finally comes into place in this movie. And third, the weird Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) the new ""witch"" that comes into the group where, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny (Bonnie Wright), and Neville (Matthew Lewis) have been for years.I have to admit that the movies get pretty dark as the go, and this one is probably the darkest one so far. The movie has GREAT effects, and I have to say that David Yates did a great job directing the movie and bringing the special effects coordinator that had part on this movie. I was amazed by the last few scenes from the movie, and I have to say that I wanted more. The only thing that threw me down was that the movie took its time to get intense, and since I have not read the book (which I will get the collection this September) I do not know how true the movie stayed to the book, and if the book actually takes its time to get intense. I did notice that some scenes were a bit rushed and that there wasn't much of the new characters development, and though the acting was for the most part good, I missed some of the old characters.I will let you judge it yourself, but please go see it (probably a must-see). Harry Potter fans will love it, and non-fans, will too. You don't have to be a wizard or witch to be accepted into Hogwarts school of wizardry, just see it, it will be staring right back at you."	4.0	Harry Potter On His Fifth Year Is Dark, and Not What I Expected!!	2007-07-11	4	3	1

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2K3L0DOPQQ697	"Andrew Olson ""otaku"""	"It is Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts School of Withcraft and Wizardry, and things are about to go from bad to worse.  First, Harry and Dudley encounter a pair of dementors in Little Whinging, one of which almost manages to steal Dudley's soul.  Harry happens to have his wand on him, however, and repels both dementors using the Patronus charm.  That action causes him to get expelled from Hogwarts, but soon after, his expulsion is rescinded pending a trial hearing.  Mad-Eye and the rest of the Order come to break Harry out, and they head to the headquarters of the Order, formerly Sirius' childhood home.  From there, they speed onward to Hogwarts, where things are anything but how they've been.For starters, Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, is absolutely resolute in denying that Voldemort is back.  Also, he uses the incident with Harry's Patronus to place more and more Ministry restrictions on Hogwarts, starting with the appointment of one of Fudge's own subordinates, Senior Undersecretary Dolores Umbridge, as the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher.  Soon, under Umbridge's tutelage, DaDA becomes, not a place where magic is used, but a place where magic is taught, because, in the words of Umbridge, ""Who do you think would want to use magic against you out there?""  Not only that, but Umbridge (through Fudge) gets a whole load of Ministry Decrees passed, further tightening the Ministry's control over Hogwarts.A main part of the Order of the Phoenix movie is Harry's formation of Dumbledore's Army (DA).  Since Umbridge won't teach them defensive magic, Harry vows to do just that for anyone who is willing.  The DA originally consists of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but soon a whole slew of other characters join, including Neville, who, up until this point, had been lacking in the magical abilities department.  Also, Harry's Occlumency lessons with Snape are included here, as is Voldemort's attempts to get into Harry's mind using Legilimency.  Finally, the Battle at the Ministry, where Voldemort finally reveals himself to the Ministry and the remainder of the Order.As my title says, Order of the Phoenix is the best movie out of the five that have been released, but I have a few big problems with how they handled the transition from book to movie, the main one being time.  How can they justify taking the longest Harry Potter book yet and making into the shortest Harry Potter movie yet?  Many crucial scenes were cut out, including (not really crucial, but certainly enjoyable) Ron's Quidditch tryouts (and Quidditch in general is cut completely out), Harry and the gang's meeting with Neville and his Crucio-ed mother in St. Mungo's during Christmas break, Dumbledore's conversation with Harry at the end was cut by about 3/4, Harry's excursion into Snape's memory changed (in the book, he found out about his father's torturing Snape through the Pensieve, but in the movie, it's when Harry Protegos Snape's Legilimens spell)... I realize time constraints are a factor, but cutting an 870-page book down to a mere 2 and 1/2 hour movie is beyond me.In spite of the completely unsatisfactory length, I was very much satisfied with the actor choices for the new parts.  Coming in for her first ever movie role is the beautiful Evanna Lynch, who plays the eccentric Luna Lovegood.  Personally, Evanna is the best actor in the whole movie, not to mention my favorite actress; she really captures the personality of Luna very well.  Gary Oldman returns for his second stab at the character of Sirius Black, and pulls off a very convincing performance.  Michael Gambon is at his best this film, as he plays Dumbledore's character to a tee.  Another actress making her first Harry Potter movie debut is Helena Bonham Carter, who plays the demented Bellatrix Lestrange; Imelda Staunton performs admirably as Professor Dolores Umbridge, the most hated character in the movie; and finally... returning for his fifth time is Alan Rickman, who once again shows the world that there can only be one true Severus Snape, and that is he.Also, character development is a key part that OotP and director David Yates pull off spectacularly.  We see Neville, who before couldn't do as much as a Disarming Spell, grow into quite the formidable wizard, even attempting to battle Bellatrix when they meet in the Ministry.  We see Hermione... okay, so no real change occurs in Hermione; she's still the brave know-it-all, except this time around, she's more accepting of breaking the rules (leading to Ron's classic line ""Who are you and what have you done with Hermione Granger?""). And then there's Ron, who, unfortunately, is pretty much shunted to the back in favor of Hermione's more affable personality; his biggest scene (not including the battle scene) is his defending of Harry when Seamus rips him for believing that Voldemort is back.  Finally, Luna really gets her time in the spotlight, being one of the first to master Harry's teaching the Patronus spell; also, her relationship with Harry deepens alot (does anyone else besides me think that Luna's got a HUGE crush on Harry?) and she starts making friends with Ron and Hermione a bit more, too.To close... the innumerable omissions may irk many a die-hard Harry Potter fan, but don't let that discourage you from going to see Order of the Phoenix.  It's still the best Harry Potter movie to date- it just could have been a little bit longer and, by extension, a little bit better."	4.0	by far, THE best of the movies to date... but it could be better	2007-08-22	30	25	5

The scenes were short and choppy. It felt almost like a poorly constructed Cliff Notes version from someone who hadn't read the books all the way through. I recognize that it was a long book to condense into a movie, but the movie bounces from scene to scene without taking the time to develope relationships between the characters, or even the characters themselves. Not even Emma/Hermione's usually superior acting has a chance to shine through the limits imposed on her by a fragmented script.I would give the previous movies a 5, 5, 5, 4. I have not always agreed with the decissions the director made with what he cut. For example, I missed Dursleys and Dobby in the 4th movie, but those difficult decissions on the part of the director and screenwriter allowed for the scenes that remained to be fleshed out in a meaningfull way and relationships to be developed in a way that was fufilling to the viewer and characters. The harsh reality that the director and screenwriter of Order of the Phoenix failed to grasp is that you simply can't include everything without making a longer movie (which is what I would vote for and pay extra to see - it is possible, think of the Lord of the Rings trilolgy).For example, what is the point of introducing Tonks to see her grump at Moody for 2 seconds, and see her change her nose. She wasn't even given the opportunity to show her dueling skills in the ministry (she is only on the screen a few seconds). Why bring Lupin back for the scant couple minutes of screen time he gets? It is just disjointed and ultimately unsatisfying.We do not feel the pain at the loss of Sirius the way the reader did with the book because the director does not give their relationship the screen time it needs. Indeed, it would have been an incredibly difficult movie to follow or even understand for someone who has not read the book at least once, and probably twice.A serious disappointment.	1.0	Worst of the five - new director please!!!	2007-12-17	27	20	7
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1RHXV0796H7GS	Anonymous	I won't get into the debate of how well this compares to the book, as many others have done an excellent job of that already.My review is merely to point out that some small scenes that were shown in the theatrical version didn't make it to the DVD.  For example, after Umbridge & co. blasts into the Room of Requirement, Draco hauls Cho in with him, which allows the audience to understand how they finally came upon the D.A., and the subsequent shunning of Cho by the other D.A. members.  On the DVD, however, this is left out, and it's not until Snape mentions that he used veritaserum on Cho that the audience finally understands what happened.That's not the only scene that was cut, and I don't understand why they were cut, as they would only total a couple of extra minutes at most.Perhaps I have a defective DVD, but I doubt it.  Did anyone else notice this??	2.0	Missing scenes on DVD	2007-12-28	2	2	0
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2OQMWEVGZ0R6Q	"Anthony Devianza ""Musak Freak"""	There's nothing really left to be said about the film itself that hasn't been said before.  It's a a great film that is great for all ages, but has plenty of metaphors that adults may be able to enjoy.  However, what really needs to be said is just how great this film looks on blu-ray.  The audio quality on this film is top notch and the visuals in this film, they were stunning even on dvd but on blu-ray, they look awesome.  The best looking scene would have to be the Voldemort/Dumbledore duel, the flying glass just looks stunning.One thing to keep in mind however is that many of Warner's bd films don't have a traditional menu, and Phoenix is one of those films.  So the minute you pop it in the player, it'll go straight to the film. And unlike Half Blood Prince, the coding on this transfer allows auto resume and the load time is much quicker.  However, unlike HBP, there's no BD-Live features.	4.0	High Def Goodness	2011-07-08	1	1	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A26O6MQFA36WBK	A Reviewer	"For the first 1 hour and a half, Order of the Phoenix is easily the best-made film in the series, not only making excellent use of flashbacks, dream sequences, and newspaper clippings to bring a new level of emotion, plot exposition, complexity, and realism to the movie, but also to provide the movie with a much more cinematic feel. For the first time in the series, we feel like we have real characters here, with real development and with real emotions and thoughts. These are not the ""cardboard cutouts based on the book characters"" who populated the previous installments of the series, but these are very real characters who develop. David Yates is the first director who really feels like a passionate fan of the books, and he brings this book to life in a very mature way...this is the first film to really capture the tone of the book almost completely, and it moves along at a very quick pace. There's a sense of building dread and tension in the movie that feels like it's all building up to a very powerful and intense ending...Which, unfortunately, never happens, because what should have been a huge and epic final battle in the Department of Mysteries turns out to fall completely flat, due to a combination of over-editing and a ""playing it safe"" approach that unfortunately single-handedly removes all the danger from these final scenes. The final battle scenes in the book in the Department of Mysteries were easily some of the most intense in the series, where Harry lead his friends (stupidly) into a near-fatal situation, and where they must flee for their lives. Unfortunately, very little of this comes across in the movie. The Death Eaters don't seem to pose much of a threat, and their pursuit of the kids seems to resemble a game of tag rather than the horrifying chase scenes portrayed in the book...the fact that the movie seems to imply that a bunch of kids could take on Voldemort's best ""soldiers"" with barely a scratch is ridiculous. The fact that they didn't even film Neville resisting Bellatrix's torture shows that these movies still play it way too safe, despite the PG-13 rating.But what ultimately hurts these scenes is their short length and over-editing. Each of the 3 battles that take place is over in less than a minute, and neither seem to flow particularly well, with characters seeming to jump from one place to another without any of it being SHOWN to us. It feels like David Yates hacked these battle scenes to the bare minimum in order to save time, which was unfortunate since he basically butchered some of the most intense moments of the series. Over-editing sometimes makes itself visible in other areas of the movie as well, such as when Grawp hands Hermione handlebars, and you can see her slowly reaching out to give them back, then suddenly Grawp's holding them again without them finishing showing them being handed back to him. Would it have really killed them to have those extra few seconds in there? Similarly, When Neville discovers the Prophecy, he calls Harry, who'se at the other end of the room, over, and then all of a sudden Harry's standing right in front of the prophecy. The sometimes disruptive editing isn't a particularly big deal, (although it's noticeable,) until the action scenes at the end, which feel very short and choppy as a result.It's unfortunate that David Yates dropped the ball with the action scenes at the end, because otherwise his movie's the best in the series. Unfortunately, the ""best"" still goes to Goblet of Fire, as we ended up with a movie that seem to be building (excellently) to something that just never really happens. Other small flaws, like Michael Gambon's angry and humorless Dumbledore and lack of impact of the death of a central character don't really help matters. Is there really nobody on set who'se noticed that Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is nothing like how he was in the books? There's very little sense of the fun and humor that Dumbledore is supposed to convey, what we have here is a grouchy old man who yells at his students and speaks in a low growl. It's too bad because Gambon got it right in Prisoner of Azkaban yet has been totally off ever since.David Yates is probably the biggest fan of the books of any director of this series and it shows. He got the characters just right and the movie's at it's best when it focuses on them. (The possession scene is excellently done.) He's also gotten the best performances out of the main characters, especially Harry and Ron. The sometimes corny dialogue from past movies is gone almost entirely, and the opening 30 minutes are really some of the most enjoyable in the series. Unfortunately, a combination of over-editing and lack of pacing really ruin what should have been one of the most exciting finale's of the series, and that was a big disappointment for me, since it was one of the best parts of the book. Still, I'm glad Yates is returning for the 6th movie, but I just hope he puts a little more punch into the action and doesn't try to edit so much; you don't need a short movie, dude, these are long books.Movie; 4 stars.DVD bonus features; 2 stars.And once again, I find myself complaining about the awful special features provided to us by Warner Bros on these DVD's. Despite the fact that this movie grossed more than any in this series other than the 1st one at the box office, we have possibly the weakest selection of bonus features since that one. We get a handful of deleted scenes, (none of which feel particularly significant, and the full Snape's Worst Memory, which was shot and completed, is nowhere to be found,) we get a pointless feature about where the series has been and where people think it's going...none of their predictions turned out to be right and since the final book was released a week after the movie hit theaters, I have no idea what the point was of throwing it on the DVD. We do get a fairly nice feature of the actress who plays Tonks showing us around on set... unfortunately she takes us away before they begin shooting, so we don't get to see any of that. Topping the features off is a feature with David Yates and his editor discussing the editing process, and giving us the ability to edit a scene. It's an interesting feature and it's nice to have watched it, but it doesn't make up for the lackluster features on the DVD. We get NO ""making of"" features this time around..nothing on the Thestrals, the entirely digital Hall of Prophecies, nothing on the Dumbledore vs. Voldemort fight at the end, the Ministry of Magic, the flight on the broomsticks and thestrals......no interviews with the cast or producers, nothing with the director aside from the editing feature, nothing on the filming of the movie....Rowling's nowhere to be seen (despite the fact that this was reportedly her favorite movie in the series so far,) and we don't even get anything as basic as a Director's Commentary. Unbelievably weak bonus features that WB should be ashamed of. Easily the worst in the series since the 1st movie's. Thanks a lot, guys.  The movie itself is the 2nd best, though, and fans as well as general moviegoers should check it out as it's a great (if a bit over-edited) movie."	4.0	Great movie that falls apart at the end...	2007-12-27	2	2	0
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A22ERTUJSAENGJ	"Armando Inquig ""Mr. Mandy"""	"Considering what Order of the Phoenix have a lot to live up to, what with the success of the previous HP movies, and the overwhelming attention the final book was getting, the movie is generally a success.The first act was a little slow, but started to pick up as the story moves forward and started to get more interesting as Harry realizes what he ultimately needs to do.  As one would expect, Harry is getting older and so thankfully the story is maturing as well. The final confrontation is intense and visually spectacular. Other than the movie being a little too long, and that there wasn't much of the ""Order of the Phoenix"" (a little too strange for someone who have not read the book), I still enjoyed it.I can't wait for the next chapter.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A5EKUC02QJKWE	"A. Rodriguez ""Kapuffy"""	Although this is the most watered down film in the series, it's not the worst, and it's not bad. Personally, I do agree with many of you that many essential plot developments were excised from OOTP, but after reading Deathly Hallows, I realized how unimportant some of those plotlines or revelations were. When I first saw this movie in theaters, I was left a little bewildered that they would cut out most of the prophecy made by Trelawney in the orb; the entire (spoiler alert) dialogue about Neville almost suffering Harry's fate (end spoiler) was left out, and I thought that that would be an essential revelation for DH, but after reading the book, I figured out, it wasn't. So, all in all, I felt the film was not missing anything as a film. Yes, if did not have the all-around action Goblet of Fire had (instead, it had an amazing finale where you see wizards wand-dueling). My only complaint with Order of the Phoenix was not its plot, but mainly its delivery. I think Yates is an outstanding director (especially after seeing Half-Blood Prince), but his transition from television film to Hollywood film could not have been made more apparent than in this film. There were parts that I felt Yates was not able to handle a Hollywood production as effectively as a more experienced director such as Alfonso Cuaron and Chris Columbus would. There were scenes that lacked the proper intensity or scenes that ruined the credibility of this medieval-looking fantasy world. An example would be a scene where Filch sits in front of the Room of Requirement to wait for the students to leave. While he waits, he is sitting on a chair with a foldable table in front and a thermus on top (two objects that seemed very out of place for this dark and surreal setting); but, then again, that might have been Yates's intention (bringing the real world to Hogwarts). Another example would be when the trio arrive at Hogwarts and are seated in the Great Hall; here, Dumbledore's speech is handled in too much of a mundane way. In all the other films prior, Dumbledore's speech marked the beginning of the adventure at Hogwarts, but here, it became too routine and slightly boring. Luckily, this was something Yates realized and fixed in Half-Blood Prince, where he gave Dumbledore the proper close-up he deserved as well as a moving, metallic owl to mark the beginning of his foreboding speech. On the up side, Yates is an amazing filmmaker, and he does some really great work here. In my opinion, this was the first Harry Potter movie to develop J.K. Rowling's strong themes of good and evil. The scenes where Harry is having internal struggles are very well-done; so well done that they brought to mind classic films such as the Star Wars pictures. When he confronts Voldemort at the end of this film, he doesn't do so physically, but it proves to be more of a psychological showdown; and it is done extremely well. In fact, Yates did this so well that I was left extremely satisfied after watching the film because I felt that the most importand aspect of J.K. Rowling's book was adapted masterfully onscreen. Could it have been done better? Maybe! But, all I know is that Yates was able to achieve it effectively, and that was good enough for me.I really recommend this movie. It's not perfect, but it's entertaining and it proves that children's entertainment can be challenging, thought-provoking, and powerful.	4.0	I really liked this movie!	2010-02-22	1	1	0

Wallach	"The Movie itself was pretty much what you've come to expect from the Harry Potter Series, no doubt exciting and fun to watch, but clearly missing much from the book. As far as the movies go, this one is one of my favorites.However, the ""Two disc Special Edition"" was a bit of a disappointment. It came with features you might expect on standard DVDs- some deleted scenes, a tour of the set, some clips about editing the movie, and a summary of the previous films. The deleted scenes don't really add much to the experience, most of them are rather short and you can't choose which ones to play - they all play in one track. It would have been nice to see some commentary on why they were pulled, or even some bloopers added. There is no commentary whatsoever, even on the film, which was a great disappointment. The tour of the set with ""Tonks"" is entertaining, and probably the best part of the bonus disc. The video that gives a great deal of background info is helpful to those who haven't seen the first 4 movies, but it gives away too much of Order of the Phoenix to be watched before the movie. All in all, it's a bit long winded and doesn't give much new insight into the story. There's a short piece about editing, with an interactive section that lets you edit a scene, which is fairly interesting although it only lets you chose to place 3 videos in order, with a choice of 3 music tracks and 2 sound effects. It's fun, if only for a few minutes. The movie also has French and Spanish language and subtitles, which is fun for those learning one of those languages but doesn't add much to the movie. Overall, it wasn't much more expensive than the regular widescreen edition, so keep in mind you're not getting too much more."	3.0	"Good Movie - ""Special Edition"" disapointing"	2008-01-07	1	1	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	ANGH6401L9Y0T	"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93"""	"As with all the Harry Potter movies, it takes awhile for someone who has read the books over and over to adjust to the things that are left out. But also as with all the others, the cutting was neatly done. I won't bother to mention what is left out, but concentrate on what is in.We start with an attack on Harry and his cousin Dudley (yes, a muggle) by a pair of dementors. What the heck are dementors doing in Little Winging? Really good question, since they're all supposed to be at Azkaban, guarding the prisoners. That there is a massive breakout of convicted death eaters later in the movie suggests that something is very wrong indeed with Azkaban. Has the Ministry of Magic lost control? If so, who has gained it? Voldemort?Anyway, the Order of the Phoenix rescues Harry from Little Winging and takes him to their headquarters in London, a house Sirius Black inherited from his family. There's a family tree tapestry that has several burn marks on it, including where Sirius' entry was. We don't get much chance to see the rest of the tree, though. And Creature has only a very minor role.Harry discovers that the Daily Prophet has been cooperating with Cornelius Fudge in a campaign to blacken Harry's and Dumbledore's names, apparently because Fudge is worried that Dumbledore is raising an army to fight the Ministry because Dumbledore wants his job. That's nonsense, of course, although there eventually is a ""Dumbledore's Army"" in mocking response to Fudge's paranoia.There are a lot of sub-plots that are somewhat distracting, but they are all there for a reason. Harry's infatuation with Cho Chang, for example, becomes important when she [not her friend, as in the book] betrays the DA under veritaserum interrogation. And Hagrid is missing the first semester, but that becomes significant because he brings back his half-brother Grawp, who ends up being more significant to the elimination of Dolores Umbridge than he had in the book.Dolores Umbridge is the most obnoxious Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher the school has ever had, which is saying something. She is what we used to call a pink and black witch. In fact, I don't recall that she ever wore robes like the other teachers. She wore pink fluffy things, mostly very silly-looking stuff. She talks in a high-pitched kindergarten teacher voice, and is enormously silly. But she is vicious, really vicious. I will leave it to the movie to express just how vicious she can be.Since Umbridge will not teach DADA correctly (she has them copying a beginner's book three times, so that they remember it, but does not teach any real spells), Hermione persuades Harry to teach those who want to learn for real, and creates the DA: Dumbledore's Army, named to mock Cornelius Fudge's paranoia. They discover the Room of Requirement, and learn a great deal until Umbridge discovers them and puts them out.Then there are Harry's dreams, and something which is more than a dream for him. He dreams about Mr. Weasley being attacked by a large snake, but he's aware of a point of view that suggests he IS the snake in the dream. When he wakes up, he wastes no time reporting this to Dumbledore, who moves fast to investigate through the portraits of former headmasters in his office, who can visit other portraits of themselves elsewhere and report back to Dumbledore within minutes. One goes to the Order's headquarters one to the Ministry, and then to the hospital where Mr. Weasley is taken after he is discovered in the Ministry, badly injured.But then Harry starts dreaming of other things, chiefly a closed door in the Ministry of Magic, and a long black corridor, and eventually a room full of glass globes. Finally, he dreams that Sirius Black is in that room and being tortured. He decides to go to London to rescue Sirius, and several members of the DA insist on coming along: Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville and Luna Lovegood. And without going into detail, they recover the prophecy (that's what those glass globes were) that relates to Harry and Voldemort, and they fight the death eaters who show up with Voldemort to try to get the prophecy back from them. Then members of the Order of the Phoenix show up, and fight the death eaters, too. Sirius is killed in the process, by Bella Lastrange. [Who, by the way, looks nothing like what I imagined her, but is very effective.] Finally, Dumbledore shows up and fights Voldemort to the point where he is vanquished - not killed, but vanquished.It's a terrific movie, possibly the best of the series so far. Even though a great deal was left out or truncated from what was in the book, the cuts are well made and the story is completely engrossing."	5.0	I Loved the Entire Series	2012-05-16	0	0	0

The actress who plays Umbridge steals every scene she is in.  Plus how did they find somebody who plays Luna so brilliantly?  For those who were panning Gambon's performance in Goblet, I think they will be suprised.  Even Dan gets his 15 minutes.  If I had to give a few complaint of this film it's that I would have liked to see Harry go at it with Dumbledore in his office.  Him talking just like he's saying ""nice day, isn't it?"" just didn't work for me.  It's like he didn't care his Godfather just died.  Plus, perhaps show the little fight with Harry & Bellatrix.  She just killed Harry's Godfather, there should be more to it than what there was.  Speaking of Sirius, the relationship between he & Harry just didn't work for me.  But I blame Newell for this, not Yates.  Yates did what he could to fix that mistake.  Finally, the possession scene looked like something that came out of The Exorcist rather than a HP movie.  Why oh why didn't they include the scene where Harry is dreaming of Rookwood & in the reflection of the glass he sees himself as Voldemort?  I think that would have been a great scene, & much scarier than him being possessed at the end.  Still, I think this definately ranks up there with PoA as my favorite HP movie.  I eagerly anticipate HBP."	5.0	Best HP movie to date	2007-07-28	4	2	2

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3W3858PT9VRVT	Be Informed Not Fooled	I see it's quite difficult to actually find a review of this movie in bluray format.  There are thousands of reviews about the acutal movie itself, so I will give you my two cents worth about this movie in bluray.  I have all five movies in widescreen DVD. I bought the Order of Phoenix in bluray just to compare it with the regular dvd upscaled in the bluray player and the acutal bluray disc.  My Phillips BDP7200/F7 bluray player upscales to HD really well so there was neglible improvement with the actual bluray disc.  The upscalling to HD with other regular dvd's on my bluray player such as Star Wars Revenge of the Sith, Dark Knight and Star Trek Undiscovered Country  is so good that it makes many scenes and objects in the movie look really fake and phony. You get too much information in HD sometimes. With the great performance of my bluray player, I will not be replacing any movies I already own with bluray movies and may not even spend the extra money to buy new movies in bluray as the upscalling to HD on my player is good enough for me.	4.0	Where are the HP blu-ray discs reviews?	2009-06-19	3	2	1

While Harry Potter was growing and getting older, his films continued to give us the proper enjoyment we were craving since the first movie.  Over the years, we learned more about the story and the movie creators never failed to give each and every movie the right amount of detail, and they gave us the ability to give us more juicy storyline bits with each new film.	5.0	potter finale	2008-06-28	4	0	4

If you have not viewed the previous parts of the series, it's really best if you do - or read the books - all of them, as many of us have done. If you don't, you will not understand the characters/relationships and the development of plot. I would suggest watching the videos before reading the books, as the books are far more in depth and actually more enjoyable than the movies. I love the actors chosen for the movie, as they all have long histories of being top notch in their field and do a wonderful job of portrayal (with the exception of the children - whom we've watched grow up in these movies and are also outstanding).	5.0	Great fun family movie.	2014-02-18	0	0	0

Of course everyone sides with the minister against Harry and his closest friends. Dudley (Harry Melling) practically gets sucked to death and the Dursley's (Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths) get a new flat screen T.V.The story plods along and leaves out key information revealed in the book. Every character stares at their feet and counts from one to ten before making their calculated statements. The film carries the story forward but does little to contribute other than a prophecy which takes all of five minutes.I do have to say that there was one good exception Helena Bonham Carter made a believable Bellatrix Lestrange the crazed dispatcher of Neville's parents.In place of story and acting we have lots of CGI filler.

There were some things that might have gotten more mention, such as the Centaurs and their argument,but it was straight forward in showing the way the Ministry was slowly interfering in the day to day affairs of the school under Voldemort's spreading influence and the unfair nature sometimes revealed by those in league with it. The scene where Harry becomes an impromtu Defense against the Dark Arts teacher was both funny and a joy and seeing Neville coming out of his shell shows that there is more we need to see of him. The battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore is not to be missed, proving the old professor has style. I hope this isn't the last of the Potter films.

In the novel form it is the longest book of them all; however, for some strange reason this film is also the shortest. At times it feels as if the director rushes through things and much of the sub-plot is lost. Radclife does a very good job as usual but I feel that having read the book, that the director David Yates somehow did not read the entire book, but merely nibbled at it. The music by Nicholas Hooper is not nearly as good as that of John Williams. The special effects are quite but nothing out of the ordinary.

I said to my wife, Warner Bros must really be trying to get people to jump on the HD formats because there's no way this just ""happened"".  I own 300+ standard DVDs and not one of them looks this bad. Not even close. In the opening of the movie, faces are distorted so bad that it looks like they've all been burnt with a waffle iron with noise distortion halos around the heads.We stuck in Goblet of Fire just to make sure we weren't exaggerating on the poor transfer quality.

Not even in the mood sense...just the lighting. That's what was so great about the Harry Potter movies to me, is that they were so light-hearted...even when they were being attacked by evil and whatnot. But now they've taken a serious turn for the dark and the boring. I bought this movie just to have it, and I ended up not even watching it all the way through.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3PI027LKHKQ83	BookFan	Kudos to Michael Goldenberg for the screenplay on this installment. This was my least favorite of the HP books, but might be my favorite of the films. He really weeded out a lot of the whiny parts of the book (no small task!) This year introduced Luna Lovegood and Bellatrix Lestrange, who were exceptionally cast and played by Evanna Lynch and Helena Bonham Carter, respectively. The concluding battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort I think is better than the duel between Potter and Voldemort in book 7, pt 2. My only disappointment was the CGI giant Grawp. He looked too much like the guy on Mad Magazine. But that small complaint is overshadowed by all the good stuff in this movie, and especially by my favorite: Argus Filch, played by David Bradley, who is absolutely hilarious serving as one of Umbridge's deputies.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1HBC0NBQJHT7X	Bookphile	"I've been a rabid fan of Harry Potter for years now, ever since the imminent release of the first movie inspired me to start reading the books. That is a telling statement right there, in that I have always been the sort of person who prefers the book to the movie.  Yet with this particular movie, I may even have enjoyed the movie more than the book.  Of the seven books in the series, OotP is on the low end as far as which books I enjoyed the most.  As for the movie version, I found it dazzling.David Yates is the director for which this amazing series has been searching.  While Columbus's first two were cute (sometimes too cute) and imaginative, Cuaron's story-driven focus on the third was very well-done, and Newell's streamlined fourth was well acted with poor effects, Yates's vision of the fifth novel was exactly as I imagined everything in my head.  His pacing of the story was superb and his use of the rotating Daily Prophet headlines to propel the plot was frankly ingenious.  There is a lot of meat to the novel and Yates ensures that the plot is coherent and none of the important details are left out but does so in a very efficient manner.  Instead, he saves the lengthier scenes for the heart of the story and Harry's internal conflicts are given just as much play as his external conflicts.  Harry sometimes comes across as surly in the book but Yates did a wonderful job of portraying Harry's normal adolescent frustrations coupled with his dangerous position in the wizarding world.  Though the ending sequence in the Ministry of Magic was trimmed, it was simply stunning.  I can't say enough good things about Yates and I was ecstatic to hear that he will also be directing ""Half-Blood Prince"".  This is a real boon to Rowling as it is such a pivotal novel.  She will have a director who will do it right.There is also a great deal to be said about the acting.  One of the great strengths of this franchise is that the same actors have been with it all along (with the exception of the late Richard Harris).  It's been a thrill to watch the child actors grow and it really helps to keep me into the story given that one of the central themes of the novels is the evolution of these characters.  While I have always liked Radcliffe, he is simply phenomenal in this movie.  It's almost possible to physically feel Harry's reactions because Radcliffe imbues them with such obvious and yet restrained passion.  Another of the phenomenal acting treasures is the wonderful Evanna Lynch who is pitch perfect as Luna Lovegood.  Lynch is truly a talent and I loved every moment of watching her bring the character to life.  I look very forward to seeing more of her in future Potter films.  Alan Rickman is wonderful as usual and always leaves the viewer wanting more of Snape.  Imelda Staunton made Umbridge delightfully creepy.  Ralph Fiennes is extraordinary as Voldemort and sends a shiver down my spine whenever he's onscreen.The true strength of this movie is that it's character-driven, just as it was always meant by Rowling to be.  Yes there is a central plot that is important.  But what is really important is Harry's growth and development.  Throughout his life he has had to make many tough choices and his decisions aren't always the best but that is the point.  Harry learns from his mistakes and it is his choices that shape him as a character.  Rather than make a flashy movie about wizards casting lots of cool spells, Yates has let this theme shine through.  As in the books, in the end it all comes down to Harry's humanity.  The spells and objects and magical creatures are all just frill.  The real heart of the story is Harry's coming of age."	5.0	The best of the HP movies yet	2007-11-27	7	6	1

SO much stuff was cut ridiculously short or completely cut out.  (I think the other posts here describe numerous problems with this film so I don't think I need to go into any more detail). One of the posts said that this was a ""Clif Notes"" version of the book, my husband said the exact same thing after watching it and I agree)  So much was cut out of this story for the sake of special effects and time that I walked away from this film completely unsatisfied. I would have gladly sat for three hours to watch this film if it meant that all of the meaningful aspects of the book were included in the film.  If I can sit and watch ""Lord of the Rings"" and just about any Stephen King movie that comes out, I can do it with this series. It makes me wonder if the last two books will receive the same treatment as they are just as long. It was as if the director and the script writer just skimmed through the books and had no understanding of the entire story at all.  The saga aspect of this wonderful collection of books is completely lost in this latest film installment. On the bright side,the cast was superb.  The children's (wait...did I say children?) acting abilities are improving movie by movie and it is wonderful to see them growing up before our eyes.  The supporting cast is grand too.  I bought the DVD because I have the other four but I hope they change directors and they do a lot better on the last two movies or I might seriously have to rethink shelling out money to complete the set."	2.0	Not at all what I expected	2007-12-19	3	3	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3N6GAJTEOF4MO	Caleb Williams	"Now let me be honest from the start and say that I've only read the first 4 Harry Potter books and have never really been interested in the rest. I must also be honest and say I've only ever really been a casual fan of the films, not getting overly excited about the upcoming release, nor being somewhat ashamed of even saying ""oh that looks good."" I simply ended up watching Order of the Phoenix on a whim and I must say I found it very enjoyable. The combination of the hidden magic world and believable characters, really allow the film to blend into one hell of a two hour ride.Harry's fifth year as a wizard doesn't start too well, he and Dudley are attacked by dementors which leads to Harry being expelled from Hogwarts. Through a series of random, craziness Harry discovers that Dumbledore is putting together an army to help fight Voldemorts army. The Order of the Phoenix involve the likes of Azkaban runaway Sirius Black, Godfather of Harry Potter and Sirius Black. The Ministry of Magic are the biggest problem facing the order at the moment as Dumbledore and Harry are constantly attacked in the daily prophet for spreading lies. The Ministry are in denial that the Dark Lord Voldemort is back and in order to stop the rumours, they must take Dumbledores power and remove him as Hogwarts headmaster. In his place is the old fashioned and quite evil Professor Delores Umbridge. She, like the ministry seems in complete denial about the dark lords return and seeks to bring order to Hogwarts. Harry on the other hand decides he must take teaching into his own hands and puts together his own army of students and prepares them for the impending war.I have to be honest and say Radcliffe has once again really pulled it off as a genuine actor. Although the Harry Potter label will stick with him forever, he continues to display genuine acting talent within the role. The supporting best friends of Emma Watson (Hermione) & Rupert Grint (Ron) provide the general emotional guidance that helps keep Harry going. Personally I found the Delores Umbridge character to be the more intimidating of characters from this year, she has the ability of being a bit too sweet giving the image that you know there's something more going on. She demands order, she wants peace without possibility of injury so she bans all magic in the classroom and insists all theory work is the correct way to teach wizardry. Well played part by Imelda Staunton.The special effects are as usual astonishing, they allow the truly magical Potter world to come alive. The Centaurs, Giants and general magical fights can only be done through the magic of computer animation and are simply flawless. There wasn't a single moment where I spotted a faulty special effect with which I could say ""that's done by computers."" If it did have that effect on someone then there's no denying it would have ruined the entire effect of the film.I do want to point something out and it's something that has been talked about time and time again. It's the darkness of the film, for a book aimed at kids the stories tend to get more and more adult as time progresses. This is a good thing for the older fan of the books, but isn't something I would really say should be seen by kids as they would possibly find it a bit terrifying. It's an amazing, honest and enjoyable picture that although there will be the complaints of cutting down too much from the book, I have no doubt that it's still a film the loyal book fans will thoroughly enjoy."	4.0	Nothing Amazing, But Still Great	2008-09-12	3	3	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1GHUN5HXMHZ89	"C. A. Luster ""The Rook"""	This is certainly equal to or better than the previous movies, probably based on how you feel about movies on growing up. Although I love the charm and innocence of the first couple movies, I respect the maturing and depth shown in the last two. In this movie we get to see good fight evil in a match up that is leading to the final great confrontation. It is quite clear sides are being formed based on loyalties to good or evil magic. The armies may not be large, but they are formidable. The introduction of a new creature was a nice touch, but the main theme is friendship. These undead looking horses with bat like wings that can only be seen by those that have witnessed death are friendly and play a key part in helping Harry. It is Harry's friendships that have now bonded those ties to fight Lord Valdemort and his allies. Initially we see that Ron and Hermione are still very much in Harry's corner.Harry isn't just preparing to fight Valdemort, he is fighting his own demons that make him wonder why the commonality of his life and that of Valdemort. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel when several school members join him to train in magic to fight Valdemort. Unfortunately they must hide in order to practice since the professor of the Defense Against the Dark Arts has taken over Hogwarts and forbidden the use of defensive magic. That's right I said the defense against the dark arts. There's irony for you. She is truly the worst person to have on your side if you are trying to prepare an Army to fight the dark lord. Fortunately Neville finds them a place to practice to get out of eyeshot of the puritanical pompous peacock in pink called Dalores Umbridge. I think she was the worst kind of muggle in sheeps clothing. She obviously doesn't believe the dark lord has returned, nor that they need to use magic. Does that sound like a professor you could learn from at Hogwarts? NOT!I enjoyed the movie on a number of levels. I think they have done a great job with how Harry has grown not only in age, but in attitude. The central theme of friendship is remarkably comparable how students feel when preparing to graduate high school. The same type of struggles they face when dealing with how to choose whether to lead a life of good or evil. I recommend it whether you have read the book or not. I think if you have read the book you will need to be tolerant of the parts that have not been included. I must admit I wish the movie had been a little longer and included a few parts pointed out by some of those that read the book. All-in-all still a great movie.	4.0	Band of the Firebird	2007-07-15	2	1	1

Though for time sake, there are a few key details kept out of all the movies (I know you can't put it all in), but these details would make the stories even better. It is, of course, sad when we lose a fellow comrade, but very poignant in the story that we realize that we would not know love without loss, and that is the fuel Harry uses to continue to fight to good fight and make the decisions he makes. He stands for the highest morals and through this, and the unwavering support of his friends, comes through the worst of it unscathed! I look forward, with bated breath, the sixth movie installment.

I liked it, but thought it to be inappropriate for them at this age. However, although the subject matter was darker than some of the others, the movie handled it very well and it didn't seem quite as dark or scary.  It dealt with the subject a little more lightly.  I felt fine showing this one to them like I was with the 1st and 2nd movie.  The take on Professor Umbridge was very creative.  Not what I had in mind, but good, nonetheless.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie all the way through.  What's really neat is that it seems that some of these young actors and actresses have improved so much since the first movie.

And so I purchased ""Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"" Ultimate Editions instead of the regular Blu Ray editions (Which are much cheaper) mostly because of the Extended Cuts.  This was the biggest selling point and the main reason to get the Ultimate Editions.Then they release ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Goblet of Fire"" in Ultimate Editions but with no Extended Cuts.  They messed up on that because by doing that they are automatically taking away the one incentive that makes it an ""Ultimate"" Edition.  Now you're just ripping people off by giving out the same product in a fancier and more expensive packaging.When ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Goblet of Fire"" Ultimate Editions came out last year without the Extended Cuts, Warner Bros. made the excuse that this was supposedly because the original Directors of the films didn't want to go back and re-edit a Director's Cut, and so they decided to respect their wishes.That said, I was hoping that David Yates, the Director of ""Order of the Phoenix"" and ""Half-Blood Prince"" would be able to do the Extended Cuts since he is technically still working on the films.  So the whole Director excuse to me is complete BS.Way to go Warner Bros.!!!I WILL NOT BE PURCHASING THIS! YOU HAVE RIPPED US OFF ONE TOO MANY TIMES!!!"	1.0	WARNER BROS.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3F6O9EE6JOTH1	Chad E. Munn	Some of the other Potter films have been successful stripped down 'bare bones' versions of the incredible book series of the same names. Order of the Phoenix however is very different. It's more of the 'bare skin' version. The 'bones' if you will- the true story- is completely lost in this film. The visual side is wonderful- the characters are great- the sets are spot on (thus the two stars) but the storyline is truly trash. What should have been a very powerful story of Harry finally taking up arms against Voldemort is turned into a messed up action movie with almost no followable storyline. Virtually ALL the key elements that gave the entire book substance are not even 'improperly done'- they're just completely left out. Even when you watch the deleted scenes and behind the scenes on the bonus disk- it's as if the entire interview ensemble  are aimed at people who were too lazy to read the books or too dumb to follow the story. It's a bunch of adults acting like they're talking down to simple minded viewers. If a person watching the movie is one that's never picked up a book- they're simply there to think the movie is 'finally getting good' because of special effects and spell flinging. But the ilk that would actually READ and LOVE Harry Potter are not simpletons- they're literate kids AND adults and shouldn't have to be softly spoken to as if the finer points of the entire series are lost to them.I want to LOVE every Harry Potter movie the way I LOVE the books- and so far it's been a fulfilling and great experience to see the movies (no matter what they've had to leave out) but this is just a horrible adaptation of J.K.'s books. I can only assume that the screen writer, Michael Goldenberg,is who's truly to blame.If you've been putting off reading the books and strictly relying on the movies to follow the epic story of Harry Potter- this is a prime time to pick up the true version of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (the BOOK) and figure out all that you've missed by watching this wretchedly hollow interpretation. And as the 'bonus disk' is treated with so much recap nonsense and fluff that only a five year old would find acceptable (every 'bonus' is either done like an episode of Elmo meets: or softly speaking adults who act as if they're talking to either toddlers or an elderly person on their deathbed who can't focus long enough to watch a movie)- only buy the core version if you feel the NEED to own all the Harry Potter movies.	2.0	The worst movie of the greatest series.	2008-01-23	2	1	1

Rayne ""Nightdweller"""	I'm a fan of the books, so, predictably, I'm very disappointed with the movies.  The first two were simply a piece of barely-coherent crap (that's what happens when you get Christopher Columbus as a director; Percy Jackson didn't fare much better), but thye have been getting better as other much-more-competent directors have taken the reins.However, some kid movies (Pixar, and looking at you) have the sufficient depth and appeal to reach and please both kids and parents alike.  The HP movies do not.  They are watered-down, cartoonish, shadows and shells of the books, with none of the warmth, depth, subtlety, pace, and heart of the books.  Please, spare me: I know that a movie adaptation will never replicate the experience of its source, but look around and you will find great adaptations.  Unfortunately, more often than not, most adaptations are seldom great, but I do believe that at least most are competent.The HP movies?  All fluff, empty CGI, eye candy, and empty calories for an audience that has yet to know better.Three stars... as per the target audience (easily pleased kids).

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3N8RZSXKN1OR2	Chrijeff	In his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter is faced with harder choices and tougher tasks.  One of these, indeed, occurs even before term starts up, as he finds himself obliged to defend both himself and his Muggle cousin Dudley Dursley (harry Melling) from a couple of Dementors (whose presence is never fully explained)--which lands him on trial before a jury of his (adult) peers.  It also develops that the Ministry of Magic, headed by bureaucrat Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy), is unwilling to publicly admit that Lord Voldemort has regained his body and is making a second try at power.  The politics of this fact soon penetrate even unto the hallowed halls of Hogwarts as Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) is wished upon the institution as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor--and not only refuses to teach anything useful but seems to take it as her mission in life to persecute Harry.  (That she genuinely believes she's in the right and that the ends justify the means could serve as a good lead-in to some important discussion with your kids, which is probably exactly why J. K. Rowling created her.)  Harry finds himself, somewhat reluctantly, forced to organize a clandestine class in magical self-defense, in which Hogwarts itself seems to support him even though caretaker Filch (David Bradley) and (expectably) most of Slytherin House don't.  He's also experiencing frightening dreams that lead him to believe his mind is somehow linked with Voldemort's.  More than any of the previous movies, this one is a story about loyalty, principles, and choices--just the kinds of subjects that become very real to kids of Harry's age.	4.0	Making tougher choices	2010-11-19	0	0	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A18G7GG53G2X8A	Chris Pandolfi	"At the very end of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" Emma Watson says, ""Everything's going to change now, isn't it?"" I remembered that quote going into ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" the fifth installment of the series; the films have greatly changed, especially in terms of heavy-handed subject matter. Not only is this film even darker than the last, it's also more mature. This is somewhat disappointing, but it is to be expected; the main characters, after all, are now fifteen years old. I have to admit that I was ready to give this film a lower ranking, simply because it lacks the bright, whimsical charm of Chris Columbus' brilliant ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."" But then I realized that I was unfairly trying to compare two very different films. On its own, ""Order of the Phoenix"" is an incredibly well made fantasy film--well written, well acted, and great to look at, all while retaining the essence of J.K. Rowling's novel.The plot, while a bit complicated, is quite engrossing. In his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) will find that the odds against him are increasing. It begins when he's put on trail for breaking the rules and using magic outside of school (he had to save his cousin from a Dementor). Cornelius Fudge, the Head of the Ministry of Magic (Robert Hardy), is convinced that Harry never witnessed Lord Voldemort's resurrection. He also believes that he and Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) are conspiring to take control of the Ministry. In response to this, Fudge gives the Ministry the power to enforce new rules at Hogwarts, rules so strict and unreasonable that they practically become dictatorial.As part of the regime change, a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is introduced (as they have been in each of the films). Here enters Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), a woman that truly redefines what it means to be the teacher from hell. She oversees a complete overhaul of Hogwarts' policies, from dress codes to class schedules to curriculums. Even social interaction is highly restricted, as seen when a kissing couple is forcefully separated. Her uncompromising attitude is only made worse when joined with bright smiles, girlish giggles, and frilly pink dresses. This woman is incredibly phony, a ruthless, seething control freak who unfairly demands respect and loyalty. Harry understands this all too well; while in detention, he's forced to write sentences with a special quill. Let's just say that it makes a definite impression.Fearing that their defensive skills aren't being challenged enough--and fearing that Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is nearing--Harry and his friends Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) secretly form a rebellion of sorts. Harry teaches the students a number of spells, hoping to prepare them for battle with Voldemort's army. The youthful passion and naivety is just as fascinating as it is baffling; a group of teenagers are willing to fight against evil, even if they don't have what it takes. Of course, no one understands this more than Harry, who begins to have terrible dreams and disturbing visions directly related to Voldemort. Unfortunately, Professor Dumbledore is of little help; for as yet unknown reasons, he's been avoiding Harry the entire school year.The film progresses quite smoothly for something so convoluted. Consider the fact that the students still maintain social relationships while all this is going on. For Harry, a teenage romance between him and Cho Chang (Katie Leung) is alluded to, as is a strong bond with Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch), an eccentric yet understanding young girl. His enemy, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), remains a force to be reckoned with. But his connection to Ron and Hermione has and always will be the strongest. It was a pleasure to see them continue to develop, both as friends and as individuals. There's a moment when Hermione says, ""It's quite exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules?"" ""Who are you, and what have you done with Hermione Granger?"" is Ron's reply, which I found amusing. Up until then, he only knew her as a perfect student, always keeping her nose stuck in a textbook, flaunting her intelligence to both students and professors.As with all the other ""Harry Potter"" films, ""Order of the Phoenix"" features a number of well-established British actors. These include: Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, Richard Griffiths as Uncle Vernon, Fiona Shaw as Aunt Petunia, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black. David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, Warwick Davis, and Jason Isaacs also reprise their roles. Helena Bonham Carter joins the cast as Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius' evil Death Eater cousin. All add dimension to the story without becoming overbearing, which is good because room was needed for special effects, all of which are incredible.Yes, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is a top-notch movie, despite its dark tone. Having read the sixth book, I can only say that the next film adaptation will be even darker, which may be problematic for some viewers. Many--myself included--have to accept that the wondrous atmosphere of Chris Columbus' original film has long since developed into something denser, less innocent. But in no way does it lack any of the imagination or style that brought the original story to life. This is a thoroughly entertaining film, full of magic and surging with energy."	5.0	The Magic is Maturing	2007-07-11	23	19	4

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1CLHGYM5NIM4C	Christian Cavicchio	First and foremost, Harry Potter and the ORder of the Phoenix was an excellent film.  Yes, the book was much more in depth and different.  But, when it comes to a series like HP you can't compare the movies to the books.  They are essentially different versions of the same story.  You cannot fit OOTP into a film.  Though it would have been cool to do it as a two part film like LOTR, but they didn't.  The films themselves are getting darker and remaining with the eb and flow of the storyline. The acting is great and so isn't the directing. Goblet of Fire was much different from the book as well, but whatever... If they had in fact stopped after Chamber of Secrets you all would have complained about the next movie anyway.  The HP movies do stray with details more and more as they go, but they are still exciting and entertaining.  OOTP is do far the best film they have made in the series.  get over it and calm down.	4.0	Don't believe the negative reviews!	2007-11-15	2	1	1

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AU503HFYAB0IG	"Christopher J. Benz ""CJB"""	As of yet, I haven't read this or any other Harry Potter novel, so I'm reviewing this movie purely as a movie and without any prior knowledge. I can whole hardheartedly say that on that level... it succeeds completely.I don't think it'll surprise anyone to hear that if you haven't seen the other films or read the novels presumably, then this film will be basically incomprehensible. One of the powerful aspects of the Harry Potter phenomenon is the increasing complexity, both in terms of plot, themes and complex world building that the franchise has to offer.This film offers a resoundingly superb, no holds barred 3rd act turning point to the whole series. The stakes are at the highest they've yet been. There is even time for some poignant teen angst, as if Harry has any time to deal with anything other than the survival of the  entire Wizard realm...  but he manages to squeeze in some gushing 'coming of age' experiences, including his (presumably) first kiss.Imelda Staunton's turn as Dolores Umbridge is one of the most memorable children's fantasy villains I've yet seen. You admire her performance so much that, if you met her in the street, you'd have to hold back from hurling abuse at her; the character is THAT nauseatingly cruel and frustrating to watch. It's a brilliant performance.Michael Gambon has finally settled into the Dumbledore role and is managing to portray some of the dotty, brilliant tenderness from Richard Harris's performance. This time, he really got to me and I've got to admit, his kick ass performance in the wizard duel with Voldemort would surely surpass Harris for physicality. It's a powerful interpretation, more outwardly canny than Harris's and he's now made it his own.Speaking of Voldemort, how good is Ralph Fiennes? He seems to relish the very heart of evil that he inhabits in this role with a despicable, almost erotic interpretation that is a miracle to behold. As he showed in Schindler's List, Fiennes can lift the performance of a villain to a work of art - horrifying and completely unexpected. He makes no concession to being in a 'children's story' whatsoever.Gary Oldman finally makes Sirius Black a powerful emotional presence with more solid screen time. Even Alan Rickman's Snape is given some fascinating development in his ever deflated attempts to teach Dark Arts at Hogwarts.And I have to mention Evanna Lynch, who is delightful and enigmatic as Luna Lovegood proving why she won the role over 15,000 other actresses!I've heard people snigger at why the whole world is watching Harry Potter films... well, it's simply because they're so damn good! Of course J K Rowling can take most of the credit. But her premise has been executed as soundly as you could wish for and the themes of magic, evil and growing up are rendered as cleverly and tenderly as one could ever expect from a mass market film. To have gotten the casting so right was a large reason for why the adaptations are so effective.Harry, Hermione and Ron are as steady as ever in their central performances. Radcliffe has somehow managed to keep his ego in check and embody the selfless, troubled soul of Harry Potter. Emma Watson is just perfectly charming and has cleverly portrayed the journey into understanding that books don't hold the answer to everything - her explanation for Cho's conflicted emotions in kissing Harry is hysterical. I enjoyed Rupert Grint particularly in this film too, he was given more voice and perhaps better directed than in the other films. His role in Harry's life is increasingly affecting.Somehow all of these characters, plots and themes have time to effectively breathe, evolve and also somehow effortlessly make sense as a whole adventure.There is action, laughter and tears in great measure here and all portrayed with quality and passion.Can't wait for more...	5.0	Dark Realms and Wizard Duels - Superb 5th Installment!	2009-07-29	2	2	0

First, let me say that I love the whole Harry Potter series. That being said, I was disappointed in the outcome of this movie. While it was a well done movie, it wasn't nearly as in-depth as the book. They are making Deathly Hallows into 2 movies and that is exactly what they should have done to Order of the Phoenix especially since the 5th book is the longest book in the whole series. They left a lot out in the movie and even those who haven't read the books will get that feeling as they watch the movie, but that doesn't mean that the movie is bad. Quite the contrary, it's a great movie!!!! I deeply enjoyed it, I just wish they had added more of the book into it (though most shouldn't be surprised that they didn't...how many movies created by books have all of the information in them that the books had?)Bottom line, Order of the Phoenix isn't exactly like the book, but if it was what would be the reason in watching it? I like OotP and I am thrilled to have it in my movie collection.For those who have yet to see this (regardless of if you've read the book or not) I suggest you give it a shot.

They can't just make up an extended version by cobbling togetehr deleted scenes and include it on the disc.  The original DIRECTOR of the films has to be commissioned by the Production studio to come back and essentially re-edit the film and create a new transfer, essentially creating a new version.Most director's don't have time for this process.  Chris Columbus was able to because, as of late, he doesn't seem as busy and the subsequent directors.  David Yates has been busy creating the momumentally epic conclusion to this series and unfortunately, that didn't allow him the time to come up with director's extended cuts in time for the studio's release dates for 5 and 6.As for 3 and 4, there NEVER WAS any director's extended cuts, as the director's of those films stated that what was released in theatres was their intended vision.  David Yates may have meant to include more, but ultimately he never was able to make time as he has a wonderful final installment to get made.Read the books, watch the deleted scenes and shut up!  These are still ULTIMATE COLLECTOR'S EDITIONS because each contains the ONLY VERSION of 3,4,5 and 6 that exist.  If you want extended cuts, become a director, do a remake and then see how easy it is to fight the studio in charge of theatrical distribution.  THEY control the money and the decisions.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"One of the things that I always liked about the Harry Potter book series was Rowling's writing, since, while at times simplistic and not as detailed as other fantasy writers, she was able to make it more accessible and reader-friendly as opposed to Tolkien who's one of the more clinical writers and very, shall we say, ""scholarly"" in his writing? However, I found the 5th book, the Order of the Phoenix, the most trying to read since the length didn't translate to pacing and Harry's caps lock-laden outbursts were quite annoying. So while we have the shortest movie based on one of the longest books, it's quite successful at the adapting of it...most of the time.Year 4 ended with Harry Potter being witness to Voldemort's resurrection and upon returning, the Ministry of Magic has been renouncing him and Dumbledore by saving they're all lies. With wizards disappearing and adults who don't want to include him despite his needed involvement, Harry finds the 5th year with an incredibly troublesome teacher, and having to teach his classmates how to protect themselves at what's coming.As far as plot progression goes, Order of the Phoenix is the least advancing of the stories so far since we do find out some things but, with knowledge of how the books end, they're not as substantial and it's the latter books that are the most plot heavy. But the main issue regarding Phoenix is that it's a bit too jumpy with many scenes getting at most a couple of scenes before we're off somewhere. For example, in the book when Harry arrives at 12 Grimmauld Place, the book gives us time to settle in and gives some breathing time; here it's a couple of scenes before we're off to Harry's hearing. While yes, the book does cut out some excess, it does so with almost breakneck pace as if someone was timed and had to get in as much as they could before the buzzer rang.However, the actors are more confident in the roles with several big name British actors such as Imelda Staunton nailing the perfect Umbridge as well as Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman and Michael Gambon still doing fine work. And while castmates Rupert Grint and Emma Watson feel even more""supporting character mode"" than ever, Daniel Radcliffe does a good job at doing that frustration of being too old to shrug off responsibility while being too young to ignore it without being a big crybaby like he was in the books (man I wanted to smack him when I was reading). The scene stealer is Evanna Lynch who probably does the perfect Luna Lovegood and the book's best new character was thankfully the best cast as well.With its exciting finale complete with some of the best effect work the series has had (but Grawp, the big giant is bad; not Scorpion King bad but still), the film may not be the best Potter but it's still an enjoyable watch anyway."	4.0	It's a kind of (flawed) magic	2007-12-13	0	0	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AYHDKBFFAFEJU	C. Martin	"I wasn't drawn to the HP scene until I was asked to take a wheelchair bound friend to the theater to watch the first movie. After the movie I had to read the book and, as they say, the rest is ""history"". I grew to love the characters in the book as well as those on screen. But I must say that this latest rendition of a book in this series, has it's flaws. I've never been able to adjust to the ""new"" Dumbledore (he's just too puny from the description in the book). ""Loony"" Lovegood's voice in this movie came across, for me anyway, as fingernails come across a chalkboard. I found myself cringing every time she spoke.I sincerely missed the antics of the Weasley twins, and Tonks could've used more screen time as her character certainly supplies some ""pezzaz"" to an otherwise dark film. The film should've been preceeded by a warning for those who deal with an epileptic condition as the strobe-like scenes flashed across the scene could certainly promote a seizure.I haven't purchased this film, and only to keep my collection complete will I probably do so. I hate to admit it, but each subsequent film in this series seems to be getting more and more lacking in what it COULD do, and is more disappointing each time I go....But I am a die-hard HP fan."	3.0	not the best	2007-11-21	3	2	1

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2GCHG6U8HTVIT	C. O. DeRiemer	"If Harry Potter at the conclusion of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix feels sorry for Voldemort because the dark lord can never know love or friendship, I feel almost equally sorry for those who don't read J. K. Rowling's novels and just rely on the films. As good as the movies are, including this one, they are scarcely more than sketches compared to the books. Why should this be important? Because Rowling has created a classic epic with the books, and stuffed them full of mature ideas, boundless ingenuity and clever humor, life lessons that aren't preachy or icky and with characters we come to really like or detest. No, this isn't Dickens, but as a literary tour de force, the story of Harry Potter and his growth into adulthood is unusually vivid and satisfying.The Order of the Phoenix isn't simply the exciting adventure, tinged with a bit of mystery and dread, that the other books and films were. With this one, the angst, worry and danger move front and center. The movie still works as entertainment, however, because it's not a stand-alone film. Those who may try to judge the relative worth of any one of the books or films needs to take into account that Harry Potter is one story, and each story in each book or movie builds on all the others before it. For me, trying to figure which is the ""best"" book or film would be like trying to determine which bite of pumpkin pie was most satisfying, the third bite, the fourth bite or the first bite.The movies, especially this one, do provide one satisfaction that the books can't. Before our eyes, literally, Harry Potter and his friends are growing up, changing from children to young men and women. We see it happen because all the original young actors, who must have signed long-term contracts or are getting a great deal of money to sign up picture by picture, also are growing up before our eyes. Harry Potter is now a young man because Daniel Radcliffe is becoming a young man. Hermione Granger's growing maturity is because Emma Watson is growing in maturity. It's odd in a pleasurable way to see small Neville Longbottom now towering over Harry, just as Mathew Lewis now towers over Radcliffe.Rowling's books are so good, and the movies are so accomplished as good cinema, that the ""Oh, no, I'd never read those Potter stories"" reaction set in sometime ago and is still prevalent among some. There is a category of individuals who automatically react condescendingly to anything which achieves great popular success. This isn't intellectual prejudice. Those who enjoy things of the mind - intellectuals - are driven as much by curiosity as by an appreciation of what rigorous things a mind can deliver. Those, however, who shiver in delight at Sondheim and only smile indulgently at Berlin, who swoon over Updike but find Dickens just adequate, who condescend to Rowling but preen over Goddard, miss the point: A good mind, a fine intellect, a curious person can find pleasure and value in all of the above. Why? Because they're all good at what they do. Intellectual appreciation of good work isn't a zero sum game.See the Potter movies, including this one, and be touched and entertained. Read the Potter books, including this one, and be touched and taught."	4.0	Get to know Harry Potter, his friends and teachers, first in the books, then enjoy the movies.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1EVV8DZBZ1DJ4	Cody Ritts	"On my first play of this movie I noticed how digitally crappy the image looked.  I have never, ever had a DVD with so many digital artifacts throughout the entire movie.I am not referring to bad CGI during an action sequence, I am referring to inexcusably bad DVD encoding.  Even with mild background movement, the details and colors become blocky, muddied, and unnatural.I do have an HDTV and a progressive scan DVD player, so with a normal setup the differences may not be noticeable, but I firmly believe the quality of this DVD encoding was intentionally reduced to enhance the benefit of owning the HD version of this movie available on Blu-ray.I work for a company that provides Digital TV over DSL using MPEG 4 compression, and if we lower the encoding quality, the results look the same as how this whole movie looks, ""just barely"" good enough."	2.0	DVD Quality is TERRIBLE	2007-12-16	5	5	0
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AKMEO6LW7IX9Q	Connor Lloyd Crews	"I haven't seen the movie since it came out, so my memory might be a tad hazy on specifics, but I don't tend to nitpick in my reviews.The book version of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is the longest HP book, at a staggering 870 pages, and probably looking back, my least favorite to read. Why? Well, the length really had nothing directly to do with my distaste. (even though I still liked it, so distaste might be the wrong word) What made me like it least was that when I finished, I couldn't remember what the plot was, and that's because, the book had too much filler. Now, some people argue that this is ""character development"", but there is a difference between character development and filler. Filler is when a book with a probably a less or equally complex plot than it's predecessors is three times the length. Some people like the filler, but I don't, because frankly while Rowling is a good story-teller, her actual writing can be boring and tedious when not backed by plot twists and REAL character development.I addressed the above so I could say what I want to say now. There are two camps of people who have read the book when it comes to this film, people who are like me, very pleased, and the others, sorely disappointed. The main reason they are disappointed, is the same reason why apparently every book-to-movie adaptation is worse than its book (this is false), because  things were left out of the film. Well of course things will have to left out of the film! I mean, the first film is 152 minutes based on a 309 page book, if we were to use the same scale of minutes to pages, this film would be over 7 hours in length! The only people who want to watch a 7 hour long movie in one sitting are either crazy or love the books way too much. (they usually both go hand in hand)Now, I don't LOVE the books, the only books I love are the ones written by Chuck Palahniuk and Douglas Adams, and I'm sorry, if you're going to cry about one certain scene being left out of a book-to-movie adaptation, or the switching of roles around, or other such nonsense, you have to attain the realization that it's an adaptation of the book. The actors aren't going around with copies of the book to learn their lines. Things that work in book-land don't always make sense in movie-world.This is my favorite film in the Harry Potter series, simply because, beyond the superb directing and cinematography, it cuts off the filler and presents the story, which is what I enjoy the most in the books, the story.Overall, a great movie, I'd give it an 8/10. No real reason for the minus-ing of it to 8 beyond the fact that I just don't think it deserves above that."	4.0	My least favorite HP book is my favorite HP movie.	2007-12-23	2	2	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AVL7K6PRM7NS9	C. Potter	"FULL METAL HARRYSaw Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix last night.  It is a War Movie, plain and simple.  What a disappointing story and a terrible message to send to kids.  Instead of using his intelligence and clever magic to overcome problems and threats, Harry starts his own (aka ""Dumbledore's"") Army and appoints himself the head drill Sergeant, who later leads his armed group of mercenaries into a classic battle at the end, complete with death, confusion, and destruction.  I was left asking myself why either Dumbledore's Army or the Death Eaters didn't just use their wands to create AK-47s and really get at it the conventional way?  After all, the main message in OOTP seems to be ""if you can't trick 'em, them kill 'em"".Harry's newly mature look is completely military too - short hair, clean-shaven, tight shirts, combat boots - What happened to the nice comfy academic robes with the cozy hoods?  We've got students being unfairly held captive and brutally tortured, a secret weapons training camp, and a small army of allied Centaurs attacking and abducting combatants behind enemy lines.Looks like the author JKR has become entirely caught up in the British-US global strategy of post- 9/11 military domination to deal with conflict, in lieu of research, knowledge, imagination and diplomacy. Seems that the movie's Writers/Director have been busy adapting every major scene from Platoon and Apocalypse Now for this new ""Harry Goes to War"" epic.Most of the critics are just pandering to the masses.

The makers of the film successfully synthesized the longest Potter novel of the seven and constructed a 138-minute motion picture that moves along through its action without leaving out plot details that made the 2003 novel the wonderfully shadowy read it was. Daniel Radcliffe has grown immeasurably as an actor, as have the other younger cast members, and John Williams' score has never sounded so fitting or so possessing. A strong balance was struck in this outing between atmospheric visuals and dialogue, something sometimes unreached in the last four Harry Potter movies, despite the fact that they, too, were classics. The final sequence wherein Dumbledore and Voldemort wage a wizards' battle was a special effects tsunami that swept aside all disbelief and left everyone I know convinced that should they ever truly witness two wizards in combat, it would look exactly like that! I've seen the Order of the Phoenix three times at the theaters, and still can't wait for the DVD. It is the closest thing to a trip into a magical world we can ever hope to have.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2P49WD75WHAG5	Daniel J. Hamlow	"As Hermione Granger spoke at the end of the Goblet of Fire, things weren't going to be the same at Hogwarts with the reemergence of Voldemort, the Dark Wizard who murdered Harry Potter's parents and was twice defeated (q.v. the first two movies).  Order of the Phoenix confirms Ms. Granger's words.  In it, the wizarding world has been torn apart between those who believe that Voldemort has returned, and the majority under Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge who has gone from being a pleasant but ineffective fuddy-duddy to a paranoid trying to hold onto power, thinking Dumbledore is using Voldemort as an excuse to rallying an army of supporters to overthrow him.Harry finds support in his usual circle of the red-headed Weasleys and Hermione Granger, but he also gains an ally in the loopy Luna Lovegood, a blonde girl who seems to be in her own world, dreamily speaking of charms against nurgles--presumably the wizarding equivalent of gremlins, and who like Harry, can see certain creatures.  She also skips down the corridors like a little girl--quite a character, that one.  But he starts to have a bit of an attitude, extremely trimmed down from the book, where he was very vitriolic at times.  Whether it's being a bit irritated at Ron or speaking out his mind against the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbrage, it's clear he's got the usual teenage issues.It's because of Umbrage, a stooge for the Ministry who doesn't seem too keen on properly educating Hogwarts's students in the Dark Arts, that Ron and Hermione persuade Harry to properly teach those who want to learn dueling and casting defensive spells.  He's qualified after all, given what he's gone through.  It also nets him a brief love interest with Cho Chang, the cute Chinese girl whose boyfriend Cedric was killed at the end of Goblet of Fire.  Umbrage has a typical sickeningly insincere sugary smile and voice, and dressed in pink and with a hat, she seems a demented version of Margaret Thatcher, especially in a form of torture she employs against the students who disobey her.Harry's reunion with his godfather, Sirius Black, provides a welcome relief of sorts, as he is the only kind of real family he has left.  While the two don't have many scenes together, it's clear that despite the limited amount of time the two spent in the third movie, there's a real family connection there.  Black and two ex-professors, sometimes werewolf Remus Lupin and Mad Eye Moody are members of the Order of the Phoenix, a secret countergroup against the reactionaries who don't believe Voldemort's resurrection.But Harry has been having more visions.  In his sleep, he sees Ron's father Arthur being attacked by a snake, which helps the attack from being fatal.  And he keeps seeing Voldemort, pretty menacing with that bald, noseless face of his.Certain interesting portions of the book have been excised, no Quidditch, and we don't see the screaming portrait of Sirius's racist mother, not to mention Harry's Aunt Petunia's knowledge of a few things in the wizard world.The regulars are...well, the regulars as usual.  Of the newcomers, Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood) and Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange) steal the show from the regulars.  Though only having roughly ten minutes of screentime, Bonham-Carter really makes the long-haired, demented cousin of Sirius Black another memorably villainous creation.David Yates does a credible enough job on the Order of the Phoenix, but with the dark and serious tones of the movie, one might come away thinking the magic has gone in favour of character development, which is well done.  Only the Weasley twins, Fred and George, provide a brief reminder of this, when they mischievously bid farewell to Hogwarts with a superb pyrotechnic display while the students are taking their exams.  And a fiery Dumbledore escape leads a wizard to tell Cornelius Fudge, ""Dumbledore sure has style.""

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	ATC9SAA8MO509	"Daniel Martin ""dantheduckman"""	We finally get to see the first of the final three installments, where it all turns dark.  Be ware:  This is not an exact adaptation of the book, it leaves a lot out.  However, they stay true to the tone of the book and to the overall story and themes that are prevelant in the book.  Harry is angry, isolated, not taken seriously and doesn't feel in control of his own mind anymore.This is my favorite movie of the franchise, closely beating out The Prisoner of Azkaban (another movie that takes a few liberties to make for a better movie).  The other three movies don't really comapre.  There is only one director who can cut not one thing from a book and still make the movie amazing and that's Frank Darabont (Shawshank Redemtion and The Green Mile).  So unless you are Darabont, cut some stuff out.Umbridge is almost as annoying in the movie as she was in the book - almost.  I was satisfied with her character though.  Grawp is strangely compelling to watch.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3DGVB3T5QJNRE	Danny G.	I'm NOT a Harry Potter fan! The previous films I found to be a combination of either annoying, dull, confusing, or in last Harry Potter film - very disturbing. But they finally got one right - Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is thoroughly entertaining! It stands on its own. It has depth. And, you don't need to know a thing about the Harry Potter storyline in order to enjoy it!After leaving the theater, it dawned on me that this story is truly from a European perspective. Anyone in Europe who has lived through War World 2 knows first hand what a powerful monster (dictator) can do to a society. It's not an abstraction, like it is for the vast majority of Americans. While Lord Voldemort is physically portrayed as a devil, what he really is is a very powerful war lord. One that would be only to happy to destroy any person, group of persons or institutions that stand in his way of absolute power. He exists for no other reason. He's not after wealth or glory, just raw power!There's even a Neville Chamberlain character in this rather clever film. He and his allies are so blind to the obvious threat of war that they undermine everything they profess to hold dear. They are so arrogant and foolhardy they become caricatures of sheer stupidity.There is so much good that can be extracted from this story - what it means to a leader, that wisdom can come from the most unlikely of places, the importance of planning ahead, there is strength in numbers, don't always believe what you read, improvise in a crisis, help can come when you least expect it!See:The Forgotten 500: The Untold Story of the Men Who Risked All for the Greatest Rescue Mission of World War IIandLost in Shangri-La: A True Story of Survival, Adventure, and the Most Incredible Rescue Mission of World War II (P.S.)	5.0	By Far The Best Harry Potter Film!	2007-08-11	0	0	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A239PPUVV8O0U0	D. A. Reed	As stated before, from the longest novel comes the shortest film. And I've no complaints. Again, the director cuts out most, if not all of the sub-plots, and just gives us a straight forward story with the main characters. Somethings have been altered as well, such as Cho Chang betraying Harry and the others from Cho's friend. Which in my opinion is the better dramatic angle as Cho's friend would've only been in this one movie and it wouldn't have had as much emotional impact on the characters. The main cast continues to improve and the older actors are still wonderful. Two of my new favorite characters, who practically stole the show for me when I saw this two years ago, are Helena Bonham Carter (who gets very good billing in this for being in it for a whole five minutes) as Bellatrix Lestrange and Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood. Carter is wonderfully deranged as Bellatrix as the actress seems to be having a lot of fun being deliciously evil. Lynch is charmingly quirky and, despite this being her first film (I think), is excellent and I only hope that she continues to act several more films after the Potter series has wrapped. Imelda Staunton is very good as Umbridge but there's only so much I can take of the color pink and tedious crooked politician/sadistic teacher angle. I know that's how she is in the book but I find the character rather plain and not as interesting as some of the other plot-twist characters they've had before. Action wise, this is the one with the most of it, climaxing with a wizard's battle which is executed brilliantly (and one can only hope that the climatic battle in the final film will be just as exhilirating). Nicholas Hopper provides an excellent score, using Williams' themes to a minimum, utilizing some brilliant pieces of his own (the wizard battle being one of them).	5.0	I Hope There's Pudding	2009-11-17	1	1	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AUZWQKUMMW4A2	"Darren R. Zane ""Occasional evaluator"""	"After watching Harry Potter & The Order Of The Phoenix, I was insulted on two levels. One, being let down as a reader of the book it was based on and two, as an appreciator of well-made movies.First off, let me say I don't have expectations that any movie based on a popular book will live up 100% to the details of the book, and am willing to forgive the filmmakers if they see fit to drop any superfluous elements that would be distracting to the flow of the movie. Believe it or not, Harry Potter books have a TON of side detail going on at any one moment that makes its universe rich and interesting to the reader, and most of it wouldn't make sense in a movie with limited time. However, I do have the expectations that whatever the book was trying to convey in terms of a story and the relationships of the characters to their circumstances and each other should be preserved in the film. Unfortunately, Harry Potter & The Order of The Phoenix accomplishes a feeble fraction of this, and the movie suffers for it greatly, especially moreso if you are a fan of the book series. Relationships between Dumbledore and Harry, Harry and his friends, Harry and the Order of The Phoenix, Harry and Sirius, Sirius and his estranged Black family, Snape and Harry, and worse, Harry and Voldemort's conflict are ill-defined, most of the time immediately appearing out of nowhere then soon left dangling without any emotional resonance at all. In fact, like the previous film, Harry Potter & The Goblet Of Fire (also directed by Yates), the breakneck speed of the film in attempting to show all the neat-o sequences of the book leaves the viewer wondering not only what the hell is happening on-screen, but also empty of understanding or empathy towards any of the characters' plights. Where the book would take time to show both Harry's immaturity and heroisms, we are only left with the idea that Harry is angry and petulant simply because, well, he said he was angry and also shouts at his friends. Only a few, rare sequences register with both wonder and emotion, but they simply remain too far and few in between the choppy editing that reduces Order of The Phoenix to an ""acceptable"" film length.And that is the great big problem of this film: the editing is so poorly cobbled that it reduces scenes to mere soundbites of no value to the filmgoer. Worse is the fact that it is unable to stand up as an interesting film even to people who have either watched the Harry Potter films, read the books, or both. It is simply to harried to try and compress big scenes to coarsely illustrate the main parts of the book,and then ties them together with the loosest of connections (if at all). There were so many emotional dead-end scenes in this film that it became more frustrating to put up with them than Dolores Umbridge's mad fascist campaign at Hogwarts. I mean, how many films have to rely on both characters explaining what and why something is happening in the movie and on newspaper clippings flying out from the middle of the screen? That to me is the ultimate in lazy filmmaking and an insult to the book's storyline.That said, the look of the movie was excellent, and the depiction of the Ministry Of Magic was top-notch. Unfortunately, due to the haphazard editing of the movie, most of the places had very, very little time to sink in and convey their wonderments and charms. Suffering the same fate, the plethora of characters old and new were reduced to the most simple of walk-ons and given few lines, which is sad given the caliber of actors hired to portray them.  Of course, most of them have meatier roles down the road in the other books, but, unfortunately, when the time comes to make the films based on them, I have the utmost lack of confidence that David Yates will be able to translate the magic to the screen, which is ironic given the subject matter of the books.1.5 out of 5 stars, mostly for the superb special effects and a rare few good scenes."	1.0	Less of a movie, more of a moving book illustration.	2008-07-09	2	1	1

Watch the elemental opposites, the dark and light dancing in the battle scene.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	"The fifth Harry Potter film sets the stage for war.  Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is on the loose, although certain parties in the Ministry of Magic would have the public believe otherwise by publicly accusing Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) of lying about his return.  When the detestable Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) takes over Hogwarts, stripping the curriculum of practical spells, and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) seems to turn his back on Harry, the angry young man takes it on himself to train his friends for the coming conflict.Radcliffe turns in his best performance to date in the least of the Potter films.  I haven't read the book yet, but perhaps it was a mistake to make the longest book to this point into the shortest film.  The screenplay often seems to race from development to development and the huge cast has become positively unwieldy, with many incredible actors reduced to brief, unsatisfying walk-ons.  However, it was still very entertaining and its awkward nature is perhaps inevitable; like ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" the whole film essentially serves as a prelude to much bigger events to come.  The earlier films were far more successful at maintaining their own independent identities.  At any rate, it makes me eager to see what comes next."	4.0	Potter grows up	2007-07-24	3	2	1

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A15IQNTQX7QYQA	"David W. Shelton ""David W. Shelton is a write..."	"Teen angst is a major part of everyone's life, but when it comes to Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), angst explodes into magical proportions. Such is the premise of this fifth film in the popular series. Indeed, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a film about a young boy's angst as much as it is about subversives in the face of a prevailing darkness.Since Chris Columbus left with his shucks-darn style of directing, the Potter series has taken a darker turn, mirroring their literary counterparts. In Azkaban, the third film, Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n introduced the lightning-fast storytelling that would be seen in following films, a technique that director David Yates has used masterfully. The leading actors have all grown up, and thankfully, the films have matured as well.Phoenix begins with Harry being taunted by his muggle (non-magical folk) cousin, but the schoolyard bully is chased away by beings that are far more horrifying, dementors. Harry drives them away using magic, and as a result, he ends up on trial and risks expulsion from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.Harry is clearly troubled by the recent murder of his friend Cedric Diggory, especially because Diggory was killed by the notoriously evil and dangerous Lord Voldemort. To make matters even more frustrating, the leaders of the wizarding world have completely ignored Harry's warnings that the Dark Lord has returned from apparent death fourteen years before.Even warnings from Hogwarts' headmaster, Professor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), have fallen flat and were even ridiculed in The Daily Prophet, the wizard world's magical newspaper. It seems that the head of the Ministry of Magic, Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy), is convinced that Dumbledore is after Fudge's job so therefore, anything he says is suspect.The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is the chillingly delicious Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), who is a clear supporter of Fudge at any cost. Instead of actually teaching Hogwarts students how to defend themselves against the dark arts (after all, there is no real threat), she limits the students to textbook theories. Harry must somehow convince his classmates that the threat is real, and eventually is compelled to teach them how to defend themselves. Harry doesn't want any of this, he just wants a normal family.The political overtones of The Order of the Phoenix are so overt that they'd be hard to miss. Themes of subversion, extreme loyalty, punishment, and outright rebellion are broad slaps to governments on both sides of the pond. Yet Phoenix is able to rise above criticizing modern politics and becomes a timeless warning against maintaining the status quo. The film's lesson is that abuse of power is costly, no matter its goal or motives.The prevailing darkness that is evident in The Order of the Phoenix seeps through to the core of the film, making it probably too scary for small children. This is a film for everyone else though, whether or not we've read the book on which this film is based. Clearly much had to be excised from J.K. Rowling's excessively verbose novel, but even avid Potter readers will appreciate how much remains. The world that Rowling created is no longer a matter of ""oh, look! It's a goblin! Look there! It's a bunch of bricks that form a door! Wow! It's a talking hat!"" Instead, it's a living, breathing world that Harry must defend using any means necessary.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a complex yarn that is as subtle as it is sharp, and it's biting as it is soothing. Harry gets his first kiss, but it's moviegoers that get the real benefit: an escapist film that actually has the audacity to teach while it entertains.(9/10)"	5.0	This Phoenix Soars!	2007-07-13	2	2	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AOYTQFRLD8VLP	Deborah Earle	"Director David Yates and writer Michael Goldberg lead us through the fith year of Hogwarts of J.K Rowling's beloved teen wizard.Shortly before the start of term, a dazed and traumatized Harry Potter(Daniel Radcliffe) sits on a swing at a neighborhood playground, staring into space until confronted by his cousin, Dudley(Harry Melling), now the leader of a gang of bullies.Still failing to learn the lesson about not hacking off Harry, Dudley does exactly that. But when the sun disappears and a sudden storm sets in, the torment ceases, and everyone runs for cover. The cousins flee through a tunnel where they are suddenly attacked by dementors, which Harry fends off, although Dudley is now the one left incapacitated and staring into space. Harry helps him home, with the assistance of Mrs. Arabella Figg(Kathryn Hunter), a squib that Dumbledore( Michael Gambon)  sent to discreetly supervise Harry in the wake of the previous year's tragedy involving Cedric Diggory(Robert Pattinson).Harry's aunt and uncle(Fiona Shaw, Richard Griffiths) are devastated at the discovery of Dudley's condition. Before they take him to the doctor, a howler from the Ministry of Magic arrives to inform Harry of his expulsion from Hogwarts for performing magic away from Hogwarts as an underaged wizard. Before leaving the house, Uncle Vernon gloats at the news. But after the Dursley's departure, Harry is spirited away, escorted by members of the Order of the Phoenix, including his Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Mad-Eye Moody(Brendan Gleeson), Remus Lupin(David Thewlis), Nymphadora Tonks(Natalia Tena), and Kingsley Shacklebot(George Harris).Traveling through London by broom, they arrive at 12 Grimmauld Place, the  magically hidden Headquarters of the Order, where Harry is reunited with his beloved cohorts, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger(Emma Watson), as well as the Weasley Twins, Fred and George(James and Oliver Phelps), Mr. and Mrs. Weasley(Mark Williams and Julie Walters), the latter of whom takes a protective stance on Harry's behalf during the Order members' meeting when the idea of Harry's having to fight is considered, as well as his beloved godfather, Sirius Black(Gary Oldman).Harry is introduced to Ravenclaw student Luna Lovegood( spacey and etheral Evanna Lynch)during the final leg of the journey to Hogwarts. It's a relationship of great significance.But  prior to that,we learn that the Order, of which Harry's parents had once been members had disbanded but had currently recovened to combat the forces of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). Harry learns that Corneilius Fudge(Robert Hardy)has been smearing both him as well as Dumbledore due to his refusal to accept the fact of Voldemort's return. The newspaper, ""The Daily Prophet"" has been reflective of this view.Arthur Weasley escorts Harry to a hearing on whether or not Harry will be able to stay in school. With helpful tesitimony from Mrs. Figg, and input from Dumbledore himself, he is reinstated.Once back at Hogwarts, a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, appointed by the Ministry, is introduced. The pink-clad, toad-like, outwardly pleasant but inwardly sinister Dolores Umbridge(Imelda Staunton), who was a juror at Harry's hearing, makes a cheerful, optimistic sounding speech about the new school curriculum. Hermione rightfully perceives the ministry's intention of taking over Hogwarts and imposing an inept curriculum on the students.Umbridge shouts down Harry's statements about the return of Voldemort from the start, and inflicts torturous punishment on him for clashing with her.Ron and Hermione urge him to report this to Dumbledore, but the hallowed headmaster has distanced himself from the boy.The belief (as stated in the ""Daily Prophet"") that Harry was repsonsible for Cedric Diggory's death at the Triwizard Tournament the previous year creates tension between Harry and his roomate Seamus(Devon Murray).Eventually, amid a mounting array of school restrictions,including the prohibition of the practice of magic itself, each being posted in writing at the entrance of the great hall by Filch(David Bradley)the Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw students agree on the need to combat the situation.Teachers who clash with Umbridge, including McGonnagal(Maggie Smith), are threatened with dismissal. Dumbledore arrives from a leave of abscence in time to spare the Divination Professor, Sybill Trelawney(Emma Thompson)who failed Umbridge's evaluation test, from being evicted from her campus home in a scene of immense pathos.Students of Slytherin House of which Umbridge is an alumnus, including Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton) become even more menacing, and their bullying goes unchecked.Ironically, the head of Slytherin House, Professor Snape(Alan Rickman), is willing to help Harry fight the Dark Lord by giving him private occulancy lessons. Using a device called the pensieve, in which one's memories are revealed. Harry learns the private thoughts of others. But Snape warns him that Voldemort can use the contents of his mind against him in a duel. During one such session, Harry penetrates Snape's mind and learns an unfortunate truth about Snape's relationship with his father(Robbie Jarvis) during their schooldays.The students find a place at Hogsmeade to meet to discuss their situation and how to improve it.Besides Luna, Cho Chen(Katie Leung) gives some relevant input, and although she is still grieving the loss of her boyfriend, Cedric, a relationship between her and Harry grows.Despite Umbridge's ever-watchful eye, Neville Longbottom(Matthew Lewis) finds the Room of Requirement, in which Harry begins to teach the students, who now constitute Dumbledore's Army how to form a patronus, using what Professor Lupin taught him two years earlier.Harry proves to be an adept, encouraging, and amiable instructor during the sessions, which are highly productive. In the meantime, Umbridge recruits students (mostly Slytherins, of course) for an Inquisitorial Squad, which will purportedly put and end to the activities of Harry and the others.Filch and the squad members are unable to get into the Room of Requirement, and Fred and George Weasley even use their illicit joke shop creations to waylay Filch. Among the young magical practitioners, there is a feeling of optimism at the last pre-Christmas session, which ends with a kiss between Harry and Cho, whom Harry comforts during a private chat about Cedric's death.Back at 12 Grimmawauld Place for Christmas, Harry is toasted for the use of the perceptiveness he recieved in a dream, which helped save Mr. Weasly's life. But he confides to Sirius that he feels he is going bad due to the feeling of Voldemort's possession of him, and constant feelings of anger. Sirius reassures him, and shows him the tapestry of the Black's family tree including his mad cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange(Helena Bonham Carter) who, with other high security prisoners, escaped from Azkanban Prison. The ""Daily Prophet"" wronfully accuses Sirius Black, another escapee, of assisting her.A relevant meeting with Hagrid(Robbie Coltrane)who had been away for a while, introduces Harry, Ron and Hermione to Hagrid's gigantic half-brother, Grawp(Tony Maudsley)in the woods takes place during that term. Hermione does an impressive job of asserting herself when dealing with him.Ultimately, Umbridge, and the Inquisitorial Squad break into the Room of Requirement and apprehend those partaking in ilicit activities. Before Harry, Fudge, and Shacklebot, Dumbledore takes the blame for Harry's activities and with his phoenix, Fawkes in tow, manages to avoid arrest.Cho becomes an outcast for disclosing information about the goings-on in the Room of Requirement. But it will later be revealed that an illegal curse was used on her to get her to talk.While students struggle through their OWL (Ordinary Wizarding Level) exams, for which they were ill-prepared due to the school's refusal to teach students how to pass them,before an imperiously corrupt Umbridge, who is now Headmistress of the school, Fred and George Weasley bolt from the school an a moment of impressive rebellion, amid the cheers of the students and a few staff members. At that moment,another burning sensation on the scar Voldemort gave him, along with various images will reveal to Harry that his godfather is in danger.Harry, Ron, Hermione, et. al try to get to London to confront the villianous forces in the Ministry by way of the chimney in Umbridge's office. But they are caught. In a maneuver in which she proves herself to be too slick for the room, Hermione devises a plan to get Umbridge out of the way once and for all by recalling an earlier rendevous with an acquaintance from the Forbidden Forest.Along with Luna, Ginny Weasley(Bonnie Wright), Neville, Ron, and Hermione, Harry flies to London on thestrals( inside-out horses with wings) where the main drama of the story takes place. Lucius Malfoy(Jason Isaacs) is the first death-eater to confront the young wizards, who while, surrounded, find members of the Order of the Phoenix in their corner.Before the dramatic battle ends, and Harry and Dumbledore vindicated, Harry will lose one more person he has come to love.After his temporary possession by the Dark Lord ends, he tells off his great archnemesis, reminding him that he is weak because he will never know love or friendship.Harry accepts the consolation of his friends and mentors once again, and as we anticipate the ultimate and final confrontation between the young wizards and their would-be destroyer, the youngsters know they are on the side of right, and on that hopeful note, we leave them."	5.0	Combat With Wands!	2012-12-10	1	0	1

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3Q1T3NNWHX99Q	Demji	Wow--what a disappointment.  Yes--I've read all seven Harry Potter books and loved them, and yes--I adored the first four film adaptations of the Harry Potter books--but The Order of the Phoenix is head-spinningly  under-developed.  Why the producers just didn't  commit to a 3-hour film so they could have fleshed-out some of the critical story lines is beyond me.  Other people here have stated the problems with this film very adeptly.  Essentially, the viewer is just left in the cold--there's little explanation or background on how various developments in the story came to be, and the whole movie plays like a series of disjointed vignettes.  (And what's with Hermione's hair?  One minute it's almost blond...the next it's honey-auburn...and back again. ;> )  My son (who's never read any of the HP books) had to keep relying on me to explain various situations in this video--and soon I began to realize the only reason I COULD explain various scenes and situations was because I had read the books.  That shouldn't be the case.  While certainly the film can't reproduce every single scene and bit of dialogue in the book--it should be able to stand and be understood on its own.  This film just doesn't do that, though. My sincerest hope is that they re-hire Steve Kloves, who scripted the first four films brilliantly, to do the remaining two films.  `And going back to Chris Columbus or Alfonso Cuaro&igrave;n as director couldn't hurt either.	3.0	What a Disappointment	2007-12-26	2	1	1

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2YUCR512YQCP2	Descent	Easily the worst film in the series to date.  The story is disjointed, likely the result of attempting to cram the longest Potter book into the shortest film so far.  The effects aren't very good and are a considerable step down from Goblet.As for the DVD itself, generally you will see a smattering of special features on a primary disc with additional details added to a second disc.  Not the case here.  There is absolutely nothing on the primary disc but the film itself.  This would be acceptable if the technical quality of the film was outstanding.  It's not.  Far from it.  Watching on a 58 in. 1080i plasma with an upconvert player, there are significant pixelation issues, easily the worst I've seen on any film.Overall, a severe disappointment.

Rowling's website that some of the things they had done in the movies had surprised her, and i think she was being nice.  a lot of what was done in the movies was an insult to the books.  i hope these movies are remade in the future the right way by directors and screenwriters who know what they are doing.	1.0	terrible movie	2007-12-18	11	5	6

Windbiel ""Dave the Smartass"""	Ok, first of all, I have read all the books but do not consider them literary classics. Rowling leaves a lot to the imagination, and when you write a screenplay adapation it gives you much more freedom to cherry-pick the best ideas of the novel. Alfonso Cuaron did a MARVELOUS job of this in Prisoner of Azkaban, which I feel is the best-made HP movie by a WIDE margin in terms of direction, cinematography, and being as true to the novel as possible. This movie, as others have so graciously pointed out, is extremely flawed in so many ways I pray that books 6 and 7 will have more competent screenwriters and they should pay Cuaron whatever it takes to direct the last book. That being said, the performances are the best since all the returning actors have perfected their roles to a T and Imelda should get an Academy Award nomination for her bit as Umbridge. I hope the final two get better treatment than this one did.	2.0	Books getting better, movies getting worse	2007-11-30	6	2	4
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A13WLPRWC7KDOU	"D. George ""KootenayFilmFan"""	Longest Book but Shortest Film, or How To Turn a 766 page Phoenix into a 128 minute Turkey.Yes, the film, including credits, actually runs 138 minutes.  But the book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, is 766 wonderful pages long, from perhaps the best, certainly the most popular writer to bridge the gap between children's writing and adult writing, J.K. Rowling,A pity that the same cannot be said for the poor wretch Michael Goldenberg who took this wonderful book, cut out almost all the supporting characterisation, and turned in a script which concentrates exclusively on Harry Potter in the least satisfying of the films so far.  Where was Steve Cloves, who did such a fine job with the first four screenplays?  One wonders why J.K. Rowling let this script pass.  Perhaps she gave up the right of script approval.  Perhaps she no longer cares, now that the series of books is finished, and she is wealthier than the Queen.Brilliant, flashing, but hokey special effects dazzle the viewer, but waste so much of the film's running time, that all the supporting characters get short shrift.  Hagrid is almost absent.  The little brat Malfoy has almost disappeared.  Hogwarts itself doesn't look the same as it has in most previous films.  Even the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix don't live up to the book: the screaming portrait is gone, and Kreatcher, the Black house elf gets so little screen time he might as well not be there.  Tonks has about two lines.The Ministry of Magic scenes which feature so prominently in the book are minimal in the film.The whole film has also been printed so dark that one needs to turn up the brightness control to see any of the details of the sets.  Maybe Warners couldn't afford to build sets with enough detail to be seen with proper lighting.  Maybe Warners doesn't care any more, as long as the money keeps rolling in.Director David Yates did the best he could with a sorry travesty of a screenplay, but even he couldn't pull this one out of a hat.  One hopes for better results with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince which he is directing for release later this year, 2008.  Good news though, Steve Cloves has written the screenplay.Too bad that Chris Columbus has bowed out of the production.  Too bad that Director of Photography Roger Pratt, who so brilliantly photographed the second and fourth films didn't do this one.The bottom line: rent this one, don't waste your money buying it.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1NC477I5AHP2H	D	"(MINOR spoilers)This is an odd film, and I'm not quite sure how to feel about it.  Somehow it manages to feel rushed but too long at the same time.  But to be fair, the book wasn't my favorite either - I found it mostly very good, but overinflated and occasionally poorly plotted.I can't imagine trying to watch this film without having read the book.  The scenes aren't fleshed out and rush by so fast that I think it would be hard to keep track and understand everything that's happening.  Is that necessarily a bad thing?  I don't know - you could argue that all of the films exist as companions to the books, but I still tend to think that they should work on their own.I question some choices that were made in the adaptation.  Why introduce the giant?  I don't understand why he's in the book (unless he plays into a later installment - I'm just now starting Book 6).  But I understand even less why he's in the film, where he serves little (or no) purpose to the plot...and visually, he's the worst special effect the series has ever seen.  Likewise, Sirius's encounter with ""the arch"" is poorly explained in both the book and the film.  I expect that plot point to be revisited in a later book, but in the meantime it's just confusing.Another complaint is that this film, unlike some of the prior installments, spends nearly every second on critical plot.  There's little time spent on additional flourishes that exist only to please the eye or immerse us in the wizarding world.  As a result, the film feels forced and incomplete.Finally, the movie's ending doesn't at all bear the emotional weight of the book.  A very major event in Harry's life is glossed over, which is both surprising and disappointing.As with all the films, this one is well acted, has some great special effects (love the hall of prophecies), and is ultimately worth seeing for fans of the books.  But it has plenty of flaws, for which Mrs. Rowling and the filmmakers are both partially responsible."	3.0	Decent but underwhelming installment	2007-12-11	4	4	0

I find as a result only about 15% of what she says intelligible. On the other hand Maggie Smith is completely clear as is Michael Gambon and many of the others. Radcliffe is quite okay, I'd say 85-90% of what he says is clear. Watson is the worst. For her one needs subtitles to know precisely what she is saying.	1.0	some weird accents	2010-05-31	8	0	8

I've read a lot of reviews complaining about the missing parts, but heck, that's what I've got the book for--if I want to read all the little details, I'll read the book. I view the movies as more of a companion to the books than a substitute for them, so I'm expecting things to be left out.The tone was suitably darker, more serious, and the actors are all well suited for their roles and convincing in them.I thought the movie shined where the book was weak: in particular, the scene where a certain character dies. In the book, it was glossed over, almost an afterthought--to the point where I didn't believe it. In the movie, it was clear what had happened.One wee pet peeve: what part of PG-13 do parents of toddlers not understand? I don't care if you let your toddler watch a PG-13 rated movie--well, as long as they're not screaming in the theater when I'm trying to watch--but for heaven's sake, quit complaining that it's too scary for them!	5.0	almost as good as the book	2008-06-26	2	1	1

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A38UHOCEKSUOSP	"dominion_ruler ""Bryan"""	This 5th entry in the Harry Potter series sits comfortably in what has now become a much darker and more mature series.  Though this is not be intended as violent and unappropriate at all, it is however much more than what began as a simple children's tale.  Voldomort - the evil dark Lord, is back in force, and assembling his armies of darkness while on the other hand, the armies of good are preparing for battle as well.  Hogwarts, though present throughout the film, focuses very little on actual school this time around.  The events going on in the world around Hogwarts, specifically the battle of good vs evil raging, has infiltrated the institute and placed heavy burdens on everyone inside.  And though Phoenix doesn't have all the action and humor that supplied some fo the eariler Potter films (and not a mention of Quidditch), the impressive story still makes this a superb film.A very serious tone surrounds the air in this film, as is a sense that there is no time for play (the overall lack of fun and humor adds to that feeling).  Still, it is a very mature and well told story, that keeps the interest of events high and suspenseful.  And though there is an overall lack of action, the climax makes up for it with an incredible visual feast of effects in an impressive duel between Dumbledore and Voldomort himself.The reality of death is back again, after the loss of Cedric in the previous film.  The loss of a fellow Hogwarts student looms the air, and forces Harry to come to some sort of terms with the facts, and with his crush, who had a relationship with Cedric - Cho.  In Phoenix, another dies by the end of the film, and this time it someone much closer to Harry, and the death is not taken so lightly this time, as the incredible feelings of anger begin to take over Harry.I say this every time I write a review for the Potter films, but we have come so far since the first int he series.  Each film adds more and more to the story, being more reality and more emotion in a very grown-up situation for simple teenagers.  The children have indeed grown up by far, but that just makes it more fun for the adults who are watching these great films.Acting - 4.5Action - 4Characters - 4.5Story - 4.5Overall - 4.5	4.0	[4.5] The time for war has finally arrived	2008-01-04	0	0	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3T3USBHXZ5Q7F	D. Petersen	Part of the fun of watching the Harry Potter films is watching the actors and the tone of the films age. Columbus created two cheery, mildly dark films that are fun yet candy-coated. Cuaron had a darker style and brought his actors into more mature form with a tighter faster-paced story. Newell showed the trio as the teenagers they've become while Yates created the first truly adult Harry Potter experience. I've read all the books and while I'm disappointed with some of the cuts I must say they've done wonderfully in capturing the spirit of the books. Order of the Phoenix is arguably the best in the series so far. Harry's become isolated and it's meant to be a darker story so I don't see the complaints on this end.  It may not be as magical as the previous entries but neither was the book! Anyway, I highly recommend this film for Potter fans and simply casual film goers. It really shows how well the series is maturing and bridges the gap for the next two installments.	5.0	Darker is better!	2007-11-29	17	14	3

While the students are trying hard to deal with Ms Umbridge's strict policies, Harry is being tormented by the spirit of Voldemort.In the meantime, Mr. Malfoy and other malcontents are trying to find the hidden prophecy that reveals information about the conflict between Harry and Voldemort.The movie has a spirited and powerful conclusion where the students at Hogwarts finally begin to come to grips with the dark forces that they are up against. They also understand what is stake and what is worth fighting for.The movie conveys the important message of unity and friendship in the midst of difficult times. Harry cannot make it through these perilous times alone.We also get to see Harry Potter's first kiss with Cho, though the film does not develop the relationship very far. Also, Ron and Hermione's relationship seems to be one of friendship, but it also seems to be more (she is celebrating Christmas with Ron at the Weasley house). What's going on?

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2C79XQMFDJ76P	D. Yuratovac	"This is a good movie, but if you haven't read the book you might find it a bit confusing. As others have mentioned a LOT of stuff is left out. The prophecy, which is the most important thing in the whole book, isn't fully explained. There is a long list of missing things, but I won't go on about it.The acting was pretty good. I'm not too picky about it, so I didn't have any problems there.If you have read the book, I would suggest treating the movies in general as something seperate and different. If you constantly try to compare the two, you will only be disappointed. This really is a good movie, even if it doesn't have all the magic of the book.So, looking at the movie itself, the only thing I didn't like was how rushed it seemed. This is the shortest Potter movie yet. I think we all could have sat through an extra few minutes if it meant smoother transitions.One thing you need to know before you buy this is that it has NO extras. It is the movie, and that's it. There are no deleted scenes, no interviews with the cast, no commentary, no cheesey games, nothing of that nature. I really want to emphasize this point because when I bought this DVD, I knew there wouldn't be a lot of extras, but I thought I could count on something. I was pretty disappointed when I saw the menu: ""play movie"" ""scene selections"" ""language""But now you can learn from my mistake. If you're looking for extras, try the 2-disk edition. However, if you don't care about that kind of stuff, this one is probably for you. Might as well save some money with it.To sum it up, this is a good movie - but nothing more."	3.0	Order of the Phoenix DVD	2007-12-23	0	0	0

I think this might one of the worst Potter films yet, only because of the amount of material that was cut for the final result.The Harry Potter cast is getting older, while not exactly more attractive their acting is slightly better than that of Goblet Of Fire. The biggest acting concern is Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) and Cho Chang (Katie Leung). They progressed but not for the better.Order Of the Phoenix is a progressivly darker film, there isn't much comedy or any lightness. Pieces were cut, some necessary, some very very unnecessary. For such wonderful books, the movies are just boxed and parts are reversed. It's obvious the movies will never hold a candle to the books. It's best if you read the book first before seeing the movie. You won't be as confused and certain parts will make more sense as the movies don't give much explanation.All in all it's not a bad film but it's certainly not a masterpiece and will not be winning any meaningful awards anytime soon.	3.0	Good.. but not good enough	2007-11-23	11	10	1

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A35ARPUL3Y9INL	Emlyn54	"I have to admit, I've had a problem with the film translations of the books right from the beginning.  Because right from the beginning, the script writer has stripped everything meaningful from the books and given us instead pretty much nothing but gimicks and special effects, to the point where these films bear little resemblance to the books they are purportedly based upon.Order of the Phoenix is the worst so far, probably because the book is so involved.  I know the arguments...you can't put it all in.  But the filmmakers in this case, right from Film #1, have chosen the wrong elements to sacrifice.  And nowhere is it more apparent than in this pathetic offering.The only saving grace is the performances of the actors, the young ones.  They have obviously worked hard throughout the years and were the only pleasure I gained from watching this thing.  As for the ""big names"", they seem to be given less and less to do as each film arrives until they are no more than walk-ons.I think the Harry Potter books are this century's ""unfilmable"" books, just as LOTR was last century's.  Luckily, Peter Jackson came along and brought the LOTR dream to life; yes, sacrifices were made there but not on this scale.  The writers (who obviously cared about the material very deeply) preserved Tolkien's vision more often than not.  The same cannot be said about those involved in bringing the Harry Potter books to the screen.  They seem to care nothing for the material at all.  And that is worse than a shame; it is a crime.Maybe next century, some young filmmaker will come along and recognize that someone needs to do justice to the books.  I mean, do you Hollywood hot shots really believe, with all the rabid fans, that we wouldn't have spent however many hours it took in a theater (or with extended DVD's) to see them done well?For myself, I won't see another one unless Peter Jackson and his team take over (writing and directing).  I'll just read the book again, and maybe buy a used copy of the DVD in support of all the young actors who have grown so much in their roles. Bravo to all of them, raspberries to the filmmakers, especially the scriptwriter (he should turn in his union card)."	2.0	No heart, no soul and not much else	2007-12-16	7	4	3
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A5BOJX3CM4XV4	"Emmit W. Stewart ""movie fan"""	"This series just keeps getting better. Each episode is darker and more serious than the one before, but that is because it is leading up to a tremendous finale in the last chapter.  Each episode comes up to a confrontation between the heroes and the forces of evil.  In this one, Harry is not alone.  He has made friends over the years at Hogwarts and they gather around to help him.  He is also introduced to the Order Of The Phoenix, which is a group of mature wizards and witches joined together to fight ""he whose name is not spoken"".  The confrontation in this episode takes place in just about the spookiest location yet.  The set designers really deserve an award for this one. And we finally get to see professor Dumbledore square off in a duel against ""you know who"".I just wish the people who put together the special feature packet would realize that neither Harry or his fans are still eleven years old.It is eleven years since the series started. The fans who started reading at ten years old in 1997 are now 21 years old.  They are much too mature for the childish games that dominate the special features disc.  Certainly those games have a place for the younger fans who have joined over the years, but there should be some more mature material for those of us who have been with Harry from the beginning, and it should be noted that, in the books, Ms Rowling never spoke down to her readers in the blatant way the narrators of the special features do.  Come on, guys, Harry is growing up, his fans have grown up, and it's about time you did, too.Minor gripes aside, this is a well made adventure with plenty of action, character developement, and just plain fun for any Harry Potter fan."	5.0	Harry is growing up	2008-02-08	0	0	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AQZH7YTWQPOBE	Enjolras	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenixis another great installment in the Harry Potter series (and, in my opinion, much better thanHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Widescreen Edition)). It features the internal dissension in the wizard world between those fear Lord Voldemort versus the bureaucrats who fear losing power. Imelda Staunton as the Ministry of Magic bureaucrat Prof. Umbridge plays her part well. Often funny, always perky, she steals the movie. She has a great soundtrack theme as well. Nicholas Hooper's theme for Prof. Umbridge is a perfect mix of control-freak and 1950s female streotype.I took off one star because, as a movie,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenixcan't stand alone. It tells the story of the book well enough. However, at the end of the day, it seems too transitional, too much a gap-filler between the return of Voldemort and the final battle. It never really develops into a compelling enough story in its own right. If you're not a Harry Potter fan, this movie won't hook you onto the series. If you like the other Harry Potter movies, I think you'll like this one.	4.0	Ministry of Magic goes mad	2010-01-02	0	0	0
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1GEKF4IB3AN0H	E. Raposa	This is my favorite HP film to date, with Azkaban being my second.  Of course it is not the book.  No movie can be, especially with these detailed and lengthy HP books.  However, I loved the camera cinematography when Harry & Dudley are running in the rain, and you feel as you are running along with them.  I love the bonding moments with Harry & Sirius just before Harry boards the train to Hogwarts, and in front of the Black family tree.  Or, when he tells Ron & Hermoine about his kiss with Cho; or when he talks with Luna in the forest.  They are tender moments, and there are many like them in the film.  I loved that the sound is cut while we witness Harry's reaction to Sirius's fate at the Ministry.  The scene with Dumbledore & Voldemort is extremely powerful, showing how extraordinary these two wizards are, and you feel the magnitude of the spells in their duel.  The bad part of the film is that Grawp looks fake or superimposed in the scene.  I find the directing an enormous improvement over Goblet (bad Dumbledore!).  And I find the young actors, especially Dan Radcliff, improving their acting skills.  The other adult actors are fabulous to watch.  Separate this from the books, and take it as 2 hours of enjoyable storytelling.	5.0	Did I see the same movie as the other reviewers?	2007-12-14	5	5	0

You really can't just watch the Deleted Scenes on their own, and be happy? You have to have them haphazardly thrown into the movie to be happy? It is really just sad, and yes, I realize that there are probably hours of other scenes that was left on the cutting room floor, but if that is the case then it truly is up to the directors to re-cut the film and add things in. That is not the fault of Warner Brothers, it is the director's choice. So yeah, while it sucks that the directors didn't re-cut the movies and make them better, the films are pretty awesome as they are anyways.

Initially, I was quite dissapointed. Too short? Yes, a tad. Doesn't really stick to the book? Not really.Despite It being (way) too short and (very) different from the text of the book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was a visual phenom.It by far had the best visual effects, score, and acting of all Potter films to date. We see Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) take on a darker, intense persona which is reflected by the same dark and mysterious atmosphere. The newly appointed Defense against the Dark Arts teacher Dolores Jane Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) is genius as a pink, sugary, venomous megalomaniac who is sure that Dumbledore and Potter are conspirating against the Ministry of Magic. Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is as evil as ever, and the showdown between he and Dumbledore is nothing less than visually invigorating. Helena Boneham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange) is ever twisted and crazed, a character she no doubt has mastered. Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy) is also as convincingly corrupt and controlled by Voldemort's evil will. The showdown between the Death Eaters and the Order is the best scence in the movie, with incredible visual effects and an intense score.As for the DVD, I immediately purchased the two-disk edition, obviously to devour the special features. The additional scenes aren't really anything special, maybe a five-second extension of a scence already in the film. The ""Trailing Tonks"" is the coolest feature, with a 'behind the making' perspective of Nat Tena (Tonks) as she ventures around the departments, sets, and cafeteria of the movie. ""The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter"" is basically just a condensed synopsis of what's happened so far, with interviews with David Yates, Dan Radcliffe and Cast, and various authors who've published those 'what's going to happen next' books. It's okay. The editing feature is actually pretty neat as well, seing as I've never been able to compose my own scene with its own sound effects and music before. Really neat feature. Overall, you'd be wise to go with the two-disk edition. I'd wished there were just one or two more features (language feature? totally unnecessary!), such as interviews or something along those lines.It took me a couple viewings to really warm up to this film, but the more I watch, the more I like it. It's effects are unrivaled by any past Potter film, and the cast is basically all of the UK's elite. I still wish it were a little longer, but there's still the sixth and seventh movies to (eagerly!!) look forward to."	4.0	Yates Conjures Potter Magic	2007-12-28	0	0	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1ROYTFVKXZUY5	E. Smith	"Okay, let me preface this by saying that I am a massive Harry Potter fan. I've read all of the books multiple times and I'm a huge lover of all things Potter.Usually, I'm a bit peeved when I read a book and then go see the movie that is supposed to be based on the book only to find that the movie has been completely butchered. That being said, with Potter, I can accept that the movies are simply an interpretation of these fantastic books, and that in reality, they are two separate entities. I also really don't feel like they truly ""ruined"" this movie or any of the Potter films for that matter.Like all movies, there were good things and bad. I'll go over the things I didn't enjoy first:Fans of the book will notice huge changes and many things left out. I won't lie; some of those things were annoying and frustrating. I felt like they minimized a lot of very important details and plot lines that really needed to be there to make the movie what it should be. It just felt very different from the book. I also feel like they may have an issue or two with the plot when they go to make the 7th movie because they left out a few things that NEEDED to be there in this one! Note that the movie focuses more on Dumbledore's Army rather than the Order of the Phoenix (which is really what the book focuses on because it's important in the grand scheme of things).Another issue is that for those who haven't read the book, the story may be difficult to follow. Important details and parts of the story may be missed by those who don't know the story from reading the book. I watched this with Potter fans AND people who haven't read the books, and found that the ""non-readers"" felt a bit confused at times and were asking me what was going on.ALL OF THAT BEING SAID...this is still a fantastic movie. I really, really enjoyed it. It's much, much darker than the previous movies and much more adult(hence the PG-13 rating on this one!). You follow Harry through his mental and emotional struggles and his mysterious connection to Voldemort. It's quite an intense film, and like I said, very dark, but still fantastic. I felt like there were fewer ""bright and happy"" moments and fewer comic relief moments because the movie is so intense.New members of the cast are amazing. Three Words: Helena. Bonham. Carter. She is FANTASTIC as Bellatrix Lestrange but they underused her severely. They left out so many great moments that should have been hers. I really, really hope they use her more in the last two films. She was great. The actress who plays Luna Lovegood was perfect too! So well casted! She played the part exactly as I had envisioned that character!As far as the DVD goes, I was really hoping for more Extras. I don't feel like this DVD has enough. They should have included the scenes with Sirius and Bellatrix dueling that they cut from the movie. That would have been great. The ""Trailing Tonks"" section is pretty fun though. It's interesting to see behind the scenes.All in all, great movie even though it does stray from the book a lot. Good DVD too, though I'm not sure that the Extras on this one are worth the extra money."	4.0	Strayed from the book quite a bit, but a fantastic film nonetheless.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2NXSGZTCQXL5N	E. Stearns	They really need to get some new writers to help get them out of this predictable rut. The special features are probably enjoyable for  children. They have games, and CD-Rom extras, but if you're a person that likes to learn how it all goes together, then it's kind of hard to follow. The Harry Potter series doesn't get any better with each new one and ends up being disappointing. It also seem to get lesser in quality either. It's the same thing you've come to expect from the series, although I think the fourth movie was actually inferior  for several reasons (acting too much out of habbit and tradiation.,. At this point, if you've been enjoying the series, this must be added to your collection. If not, you won't start so the value to the rest of the series is zero.	4.0	predictable	2011-06-29	4	1	3
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2EBKJDM0QBLK6	Esteemed Protector	"A vicious attack!An unfair accusation!These incidents are just the start of the challenges Harry must face in The Order of the Phoenix.  Dumbledore has warned everyone Voldermort is on the loose yet not every one believes him, or, to be more precise, wants to.  Some go so far as to question his competency.  Harry is also under suspicion - ""THE BOY WHO LIES"" cries the Daily Chronicle.  Indeed, after a near fatal dementor attack poor Harry finds himself facing the Ministry of Magic.  It is only the timely intervention of Dumbledore that prevents Harry's expulsion from Hogwarts!  There are changes at Harry's alma mata, not all good.  The new defense against the dark arts teacher is one Delores Umbridge, a ministry of magic troubleshooter and troublemaker who's sweet exterior hides an unpleasant persona with equally unpleasant plans for Hogwarts.  Harry finds himself suspected of foul play.  After all he was the only one that saw Cedric die, right?  Finally, there is Voldermort himself who is very much alive, and very, very dangerous.  He has freed several former death eaters from Azkabahn, the most vicious being the twisted Bellatrix LaStrange, responsible for the torture and murder of Neville Longbottom's parents.  Voldermort and Harry seem to have developed some sort of psychic connection.  Harry fears Voldermort may be able to read his thoughts, maybe even control his action.Yet there is still good.  Harry meets Luna Lovegate, a strange girl who seems strangely at peace. Harry's friends are back, as loyal as ever. In addition to Ron and Hermione, Sirius Black has returned along with Mad-Eye Moody and Remus Lupin.  They introduce Harry to the Order of the Phoenix, a group they formed to stop Voldermort when he first came to power.  As Umbridge's hold over Hogwarts becomes an iron grip, Hogwarts students rally around Harry and form the landestine ""Dumbedore's army"".  Will they be able to stop Umbridge and her lackey minions?  Will Harry learn the secret of his Voldermort connection?  Finally, what creature is Hagrid hiding this time?This movie, like its predecessors, is an excellent adaptation of the book.  Similar to The Goblet of Fire, The Order of the Phoenix has a noticeably grim, serious feeling about it.  The actors are again allowed to act their age and their characters are developed accordingly.  Neville Longbottom's character has undergone the greatest change.  The yahoo of yesteryear has matured into a loyal friend and formidable fighter.  Most importantly, examples can be applied from The Order of the Phoenix to present day society.  In The Goblet of Fire, Dumbledore says, ""The time will soon come when we will have to choose between what is right and what is safe.""  The Order of the Phoenix shows the mistake of trying to do what is safe for the simple sake of doing so.  Neutering Hogwarts does not stop Voldermort nor does denying his existence make him go away. There will always be Voldermorts that have to be dealt with, and to deny their existence only makes them grow stronger."	4.0	THIS PHOENIX FLIES!!!	2007-12-20	0	0	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1XWQ13VJDOQ7C	"eternal now ""roejoerrer"""	"If you're a die hard, cutthroat Harry Potter fan, then the motion picture adaption of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" will raise quite a few flags. Much was cut out due to time constraints and to appeal to a wider audience, instead of only the ""fans"" of the book series.However, that is not to say that the film adaption of the 5th book in the Harry Potter series falls along the ranks of box office duds ""Super Mario Brothers"", or the horribly mistaken ""Johnny Mnemonic"". ""Order of the Phoenix"" is a fine film that, while shifting the emphasis of certain parts in the book, creates a captivating film that only falters a few times.Dark dreams ravish Harry Potter in his sleep, dreams of Voldermort's return, and Cedric Diggory's death.In his 5th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, things are once again taking a turn for the worse. Voldermort has returned, and he is bent on eliminating the one person that can defeat him, Harry Potter. Dark dreams plague Harry's mind. The school comes under fire when a new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher is announced. control of the school is soon wrenched away from Headmaster Professor Dumbledore and into the hands of Ministry of Magic stooge Professor Umbridge, who bans defensive magic in her eager attempt to disable Hogwarts. The students, in rebellion form Dumbledore's Army. Meanwhile Voldermort is amassing his own army...If you're an avid fan or the casual reader, I'm quite positive there is much to enjoy here; if not for the themes then for the amazing picture quality and engrossing audio quality. The video quality is pristine, making every detail, every imperfection stand revealed. Its not really all that big of a deal, but I really enjoy the fact that I can make out the finest detail in every scene. You can see the minute detail on the castle walls, cracks, dents, and the general wear and tear on wood, and the pores and imperfections on the faces of each actor. Again, not a HUGE deal, but 1 more level of ambiance that really makes the film come alive.Colors are vibrant (especially the greens, reds, pinks and blues), the blacks are black (sometimes they get a little too black) and the whites are white. It is a treat alone to admire the amazing video transfer and the awesome audio. ""Order of the Phoenix"" is by no means a ""demo disc"", but it will probably turn some heads, especially during the blue screen shots, and the CGI-infused scenes. At times there is a noticeable amount of picture fuzz, mostly on faces and bright special effects, but it is so minute that it doesn't detract from the experience.The audio is excellent, especially if you have a nice surround system. I'm using a cheap RCA one, and it sounds amazing. Lots of bass heavy moments, very reminiscent of movie theater audio quality.The Harry Potter books have translated very well to the silver screen, and these films are a must for the avid Fantasy fan. The acting is of pretty high quality, especially noteworthy since the cast is mostly kids.The one problem with the Harry Potter motion picture film series is that, the only way to truly understand the story arc, you really need to start with ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" and work your way up. As far as character development in this series, it is constant and ever changing, but the primary groundwork for most of the characters was established in the first three films. ""The Order of the Phoenix"" doesn't delve too far into any of the main characters, aside from their feelings, and the casual dabbler may get lost in the intertwining story arcs."	4.0	Entertaining	2008-02-11	2	0	2
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2VEY1TSG8P1PM	Ethan Gorham	A great Blu Ray release. Sound and picture is excellent. Didn't notice any Digital Noise or sound dropping during scenes. A great looking movie to show off the power of your HD TV and Surround Sound system. Even if you don't have those, the Special Features are more than worth the buy. They don't just feature everybody patting each other on the back, but really get into the meat of how this Movie was made.Regarding the movie, as a movie (!), I found it to be one of the most entertaining of the series. As an adaptation, however, I'll say its sorely lacking, which brings me to a slight feeling of disappointment regarding its length. It could've been a better adaptation. This isn't to say its a bad adaptation, but to say it could've definitely been better, which brings me to something I feel should be addressed: the notion of an Extended Cut of the film.The Extended Cut doesn't exist, folks, or at least not the one you're looking for. I've read the screenplay (The Shooting Script), and with the exception of a scene in Professor Trelawney's classroom, which was filmed and is included as a Deleted Scene here, and Professor McGonagall's Stunning Spell scenes (which, as written, were completely over the top and might've killed the overall tone of the film), there is nothing else to add save for a bunch of scenes that would be remarkably hindering of the film's pacing (like Harry skipping stones or the Threstrals scene with Hagrid). The film is actually better than the script, as Director David Yates, together with Mark Day, improved on the film's pacing by shortening some scenes, jump cutting (like during the climax and during Harry's dreams/premonitions) and using newspaper montages. That supposed 40 minutes of cut-footage? Outside of maybe 20 minutes of Deleted Scenes which wouldn't add anything, it was cut FOOTAGE. Alternate takes, unused coverage, and cut lines- the stuff that proves useless in making a movie better, and can in fact make a movie worse (The Director's Cut of The Chronicles of Riddick). Its like that one famous unused shot from The Dark Knight showing Heath Ledger as The Joker cackling on the school bus while the Hospital blows up outside of the bus windows = completely unnecessary.The Extended Cuts that certain people are looking for in the series couldn't exist, anyways. After all, Rowling's books were still being released when the films were, and she famously refused to cue in Steve Kloves and the directors on where the series was headed, given her fear that they may spoil important plot points of later books before their release. The only films in the series that could've had proper Extended Cuts are The Half-Blood Prince and The Deathly Hallows, and rather than do that, David Yates set about finishing the series as its own separate being from the books (including things like Flying Death Eaters, the burning Weasley home, and the like). There still could be solid Extended Cuts of those films, but those probably wouldn't improve the films as better adaptations.Sorry I spent so much time on that aspect, but it needed to be addressed, and badly, seeing the many comments and reviews trashing The Ultimate Editions of the films over the lack of Extended Cuts. If you're a complete Potter Movie nut, this is the set to buy. Your Blu Ray player will thank you.	5.0	Great Set, but an honest review	2011-11-08	2	2	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1EAH69BFWEDHY	Ferris Bueller	The Video: Sizing Up the Picture'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' is certainly a flagship next-gen title for Warner. The film is debuting on both Blu-ray and HD DVD day-and-date with the standard DVD version, and though there are some notable differences in terms of audio and extras, the one area where both high-def editions match up is this 1080p/VC-1 encode (framed at the film's original 2.40:1 theatrical aspect ratio). Warner has certainly delivered the goods, and even with the startling number of reference-quality high-def titles I've reviewed in recent weeks, 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' easily stands tall, boasting yet another a five-star video presentation.I've often used the term &#34;picture window effect&#34; in my reviews, but right from the film's opening sequence, 'Order of the Phoenix' boasts some of the most three-dimensional images I've yet seen on a next-gen title. This continues throughout the film, with the level of detail and depth to this Blu-ray disc truly fantastic. Sharp, resplendent in fine texture and perfectly balanced in terms of balance and contrast, 'Order of the Phoenix' is absolutely top tier.Of course, any 'Harry Potter' film is one of fantasy, and as such it's clear throughout that we are in a surreal and vibrant world. Colors are pushed to the max of saturation, but always stay one millimeter away from oversaturation. Hues remain rock solid and free of noise or other defects, so despite obvious skews in terms of color (blues and yellows are particularly accentuated), the presentation still feels surprisingly natural. Warner has also done a terrific job with compression, and I had no problems with any artifacts -- no edge enhancement, macroblocking or banding (even in heavily CGI'd sequences). Simply put, 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' is a stunner.The Audio: Rating the SoundWarner has been much better recently with their support of high-res audio on the majority of their next-gen releases, and this Blu-ray edition of 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' continues the trend with a stellar uncompressed PCM 5.1 Surround mix (48kHz/24-bit). It's easily on par with the Dolby TrueHD track on the HD DVD -- in fact, any audible differences are so marginal it's a wash. Both rate as a sparkling sonic experience. (Note that the Blu-ray does outgun the HD DVD when it comes to foreign language options. Although the HD DVD contains only English, French and Spanish tracks and subtitles, this Blu-ray edition contains a wealth of additional options -- check out the left sidebar for the complete list.)It's no surprise that Warner spared no expense in bringing the latest Harry Potter adventure to the big screen. This is the best sound design you're likely to hear this year -- bold, highly immersive and unflagging in its sustained aggressiveness. There are so many fantastic sequences that you can just pick a chapter for instant demo material (the film's final 45 minutes in particular are a true aural delight). The rear soundfield is alive throughout, with sounds bounding all around with a transparency that's as close to the movie theater as you're going to get. Minor ambiance is not ignored either, with quieter scenes boasting a palpable surround presence. Even a simple whoosh of Harry's wand is often accompanied by a delightful subtle wisp of sound in the rears.All other aspects of the source are equally excellent. Integration of music, dialogue and effects is pitch-perfect. Even with so many younger actors (and their sometimes thick English accents), I made out every word without ever reaching for my remote's volume controls. The score (by Nicholas Hooper, subbing for John Williams) is also impressively dispersed, with the appropriate majestic quality. And although 'Order of the Phoenix' may not be the subwoofer juggernaut of a film like 'Transformers,' when bass is needed, believe me, you'll feel it. There is not one aspect of this mix that disappoints.	5.0	Hi Def Digest said it best: Order Of The Phoenix is the best of the Harry Potter films on Blu-ray...	2013-08-28	1	1	0
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A38JWSLCF9AYOZ	Fluffy's Owner	This was the only Harry Potter film that, when I first saw it, I thought merited only a 4-star rating instead of a 5-star one. I thought that at the time because they had cut so much of the book out. The longest Harry Potter book was the shortest Harry Potter film! However, watching it again today and other times after my first viewing made me re-evaluate my original score. Why? There are several reasons (as usual). First off, the acting was some of the best I've ever seen in a movie. The regulars were all perfect, as usual (for my reasons why, see my review of Harry Potter 1). Despite that, the thing that made the film perfect was the newcomers. I've never found anyone who disagrees with me when I say that Luna and Umbridge were flawlessly cast. Luna just seemed so ... Luna! And Umbridge fooled you into thinking she was kind and sweet and then revealed her twisted nature, in acting so flawless that we viewers forgot it was just a role. Going back to Luna, I thought she sometimes stole the show. Neville also made you see another side of him. Another reason I changed my rating was that I understood that a film should be judged in its own right, and not as an adaptation of the book. Judging it as a film in its own right, it certainly earns a 5-star rating. Some characters had virtually no screen time (Malfoy), but this overall strengthened the film because in spite of Malfoy's flawless performance, the character itself would have hindered the development of the film. Filch was just downright funny. The scene with Dumbledore and Voldemort dueling is terrifying and riveting. It also shows great special effects. It was also nice to see Harry and his friends venture outside Hogwarts grounds. The Ministry of Magic was particularly interesting. I still can't believe what an hilarious buffoon Fudge is! He hires Umbridge who is clearly a twisted maniac (I DON'T CARE HOW MANY KITTEN PHOTOS SHE HAS!) and doesn't believe Dumbledore, who has never failed him before. Fudge is really quite dumb. I'm glad he was replaced as Minister of Magic. I could go on with reasons why I loved this film, but I think you get the point. So, I shall simply thank you for reading this review and give Harry Potter - The Order of the Phoenix 5 stars.P.S. I love Grawp!	5.0	A 12-year-old's review	2010-12-12	0	0	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A16IRCKUPASG2R	"F. Ramirez ""F Ra"""	My favorite book has become my least favorite movie in the series. Director David Yates seemed to borrow from Alfonso Cuaron's style of directing and failed miserably.  Rushed and too short by Potter movie standards, this movie left me scratching my head, wondering what the heck just happened. Two of the strongest female characters in the series, Tonks and Bellatrix, were given nothing more than a few seconds of screentime. Huge disappointment. Daniel Radcliffe, though a good actor, seemed a bit too stretched at times. All of the actors simply look exhausted. Gone was the chemistry of past movies. The writers and directors of the series really have to scramble to play into Rowlings book series, but it only makes the movies more and more lackluster, especially to those who do not read the books (most moviegoers). I miss Cuaron's style, his interpretation of the series was brilliant and cannot be topped in my opinion. I'm not looking forward to the rest of the movie series, since the ending was the biggest disappointment in fiction I have ever known. The only brightside to this movie, Helena Bonham Carter. The few seconds she got onscreen were absolutely brilliant. Other than that, this movie was a huge letdown.And regarding the special 2 disc set - don't waste your money!

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1DA6E4FNRSAWN	Furio	Confronted with the huge fifth episode of the Potter's series the authors did the only thing possible: they cut, mercilessly.I know, I know, most of Rowling's fans will hate me for saying this and I am not saying that they could not have cut differently, but there is no way the whole of the book could have come into the movie even if the movie had been an hour longer. Even in the first movie there were no menial cuts despite the first episode being short and straight forward.Personally speaking I disagree about the choice of making this fifth episode the classical, all American instance of the all American underdog, e.g. Harry who at the start of the movie is laughed at or condescended upon even by his protectors and then shows everybody how right he was. Some seeds of this are in the book itself but Ms Rowling was so much more interested (too interested unfortunately) in underlining his isolation, his solitude, his desperation.I disagree with the choice of making a complete fool of Sybil Cooman: she knows very well she is not a greet seeress, she is frustrated, not ridiculous. Ms Thompson of course is a superb actress, even in the questionable and questionably deleted scene of the dessert.I disagree with the decision of making a raving lunatic of Bellatrix: in the books she is obsessed and evil, not ranting. The capabilities of Ms Bonham Carter are wasted.The cuts to the insufferable love ramblings of the characters (the thing I hated in the book) are merciful as, for different reasons, are those to the character of Umbridge. Ms Staunton is a distinguished actress and because of this she perfectly conveys the repulsive character she is playing: more of it would have been too much to bear.All in all the movie was good but not breathtaking: it renders the gloom atmosphere allright but it has no cutting edge. When Fred and George leave the school the real sense of a school which, because of the ministry, has failed to educate two young men who are better off by themselves than in such a setting should be unbearably bitter. What do we have instead? Very nice special effects and a laughter or two.Only when Luna Lovegood is in the spotlight things change: she was the most exquisite character of the book and she is the main feature here: the authors managed to render her being an outsider and the actress is so good as to give her lines their full meaning. Only her permed hair does not make any sense. Of course... could Luna be played by a girl with wavy hair? I think not... ... LOL	3.0	sensible	2008-11-27	1	1	0

Overall I did not expect all of the dialogue to make it into the movie but I do feel the movie left out certain important parts as when Ron and Hermione make prefects, this was not in the movie at all.But in the end this is still a good movie and like the description says better for the kids as the book was much more darker than the movie and the 4th movie was also much darker also.	4.0	Good movie but not when compared to the book	2007-12-09	1	1	0

The scene with Hagrid and the kids in the forest are even worse, since there is a dark, reddish brown ground under their feet.

Why are they even bothering if this is the best they can do?The bottom line is this. Trying to turn a novel, any novel, into a movie is a stupid idea. Everybody please stop.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	ARJIAB8SLWAOU	"George Buttner ""Agent0042"""	"By now, everyone probably already knows what this film is about and what it's like, so I'll just touch on it briefly. In ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" Harry and his friends are faced with the fact that the Dark Lord, Voldemort, is back. While they and a group organized by Albus Dumbledore, the Order of the Phoenix, are trying to fight him, they're thwarted by the Ministry of Magic, who first sends Harry to a hearing for using magic to defend himself against Dementors, and then installs Dolores Umbridge as ""High Inquisitor of Hogwarts."" Umbridge does her best to try to take rigid control of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but Harry and his friends mount an active rebellion in the form of Dumbledore's Army -- a secret group in which Harry teaches his friends and classmates powerful Defense Against the Dark Arts.Overall, I found the film solid enough, but as has been mentioned, the longest book in the series was compressed into the smallest ""Harry Potter"" film to date. It seemed to me like they tried to include small bits of just about everything from the book into the film, save Quidditch. Still, while I wasn't entirely satisfied with the film in the theatre, I found I enjoyed it more watching it on DVD. I agree with what's been said about the subtitling, though, in that this should always match what's said word-for-word, not shortened, as so many films seem to have taken to doing lately.I bought the Two-Disc Special Edition of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" and I'm glad that I did. The extra features are well worth the additional price. One of the best features is ten minutes of additional scenes, which include Umbridge's interrogation of Trelawney, among others. A lot of fun to watch. You'll also find ""Trailing Tonks."" This is a wonderful feature in which Natalia Tena (the actress who played Nymphadora Tonks) takes you on an exploration of the set for the ""Harry Potter"" movies. You get to visit everywhere from the special effects department to her trailer. There's also ""The Magic of Editing,"" in which the film's director David Yates and editor Mark Day show how editing choices such as music selection and camera angles help to make the film the best it can be. And finally, there's ""The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter."" This was a TV special that aired on a pay cable/satellite network not long before the film came out. If you saw it before, well worth watching again. If not, enjoy this exploration of past films and this current one for clues to where the series of going.One of the most interesting special features on this DVD is something I haven't seen before, but is really quite cool --- a bonus digital copy of the film! You need to have a DVD-ROM drive attached to your computer for this. Then, you enter an included registration code, and it will copy a digital version of the film directly to your hard drive. The ovearll quality is awesome, though one small nitpick -- this version doesn't seem to have any captions or subtitles available. One other thing, make sure you have around a gigabyte of space on your drive to spare if you're going to load the digital version.There are other great DVD-ROM features as well, so if your computer has DVD-ROM, get ready for an excellent DVD experience."	4.0	Two-Disc Special Edition Shines -- Worth the Price --- Excellent Bonus Features!	2007-12-27	3	3	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A26S7BZS9UU3W1	Geri	"This movie had some great special effects and I still love the gang from Hogwarts, but it was also very disappointing.  The story was shortened so badly that elements that should have been emphasized got lost in translation.  If you read the book you could probably follow along, but I feel sorry for those people who just wanted to see the movie.  Too many things weren't explained.The dreams that Harry had about the ministry of magic were a key element in the story, yet they were barely shown in the film.  The attack on Mr Weasley and the ""hunt"" for the prophecy were much too vague in the movie, yet the prophecy and Voldemort's desire for it was the key point of the story.At Hogwarts, the appointment of Dolores Umbridge as the High Inquisitor, and later as the replacecment for Dumbledore, was also a key story line.  She banned groups of three or more students from meeting, which is why they needed a secret place to train together.  She didn't want them to learn defense, so she taught them the book.  She passed one decree after another making life miserable for the stundents, yet that was relegated to simply showing Filch hanging one frame after the other.This movie had very little impact on the understanding of the continuing story of Harry, Hermione and Ron.  The important of the OWLS for the students was downplayed, as was the intense scrutiny of the teachers by Umbridge and her dismissal of Trelawny.  Let's don't forget about the departure of the Weasley twins.  In the film it wasn't much more than a quick fireworks scene and them flying away...not the impact that their leaving should have had.And where the heck was the Order of the Phoenix in all this???  There were very few hints at the Order throughout the film...kinda of defeats the purpose of the title.All in all, I wasn't very satisfied at the end of the film.  I really think they could have added 30 minutes and done more justice to the story."	2.0	Order of the Phoenix...where's the rest of the story?	2008-04-06	1	1	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1Q8KFCJOJAHBS	Gina	This fifth installment in the Harry Potter series is the first that doesn't quite hang together as a movie for me.  Parts of it seem like a dramatization of scenes from the book rather than part of a narrative whole.  That said, it is overall an enjoyable movie and, if you've read the book, you should be able to follow it as such.As usual, the story has been streamlined by cutting characters (Mundungus Fletcher, Rita Skeeter, Marietta) and subplots (house elves at Hogwarts, everything at St. Mungo's, the Quibbler).  This works, although I would have liked to see just a bit of character development for Tonks and Shacklebolt and Mrs. Figg -- it isn't even made clear that she's a squib.  These character just appear, sort of like -- ok, you read about them, so here they are.  Same goes for Kreecher, who shows up muttering twice but whose role in Harry's attempt to rescue Sirius is totally left out.  It was nice to see more of the Weasley twins, though.  The acting is superb, particularly Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal of Harry's reaction to Sirius's death and his possession by Voldemort near the end. The sets are wonderful, and the special effects -- as expected -- are spectacular.  I particularly enjoyed Dumbledore's sudden departure from his office, but the Weasley twins' rampage and the Thestrals were also great.  The confrontation in the Hall of Mysteries lived up to all expectations, particularly the breaking glass globes and the chaotic battle scenes, through which Death Eaters flow at will.That said, I really didn't like a lot of the costuming.  Too many characters were dressing like muggles and the Dementors are much scarier when they're shrouded.  In the tunnel scene, they looked like human thestrals.  And the scene between Hermione and Grawp was way too King Kong.  Overall, though, this film is well worth watching.	4.0	Harry V: First, Read the Book	2008-01-01	1	1	0
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A21XVS00AIENLX	"G. Jennings ""G. J."""	I didn't read any of the Potter books, and I thought this was a great movie!  This was much better than the other four put together!  I don't know what was left out from the story, but I don't flipping care.  The same happened to Lord of the Rings (which I read), and people still loved it.  When will people learn that books and film are TWO different forms of story-telling media?  You can't put a concentrated, action-packed 3D story onto a two dimensional screen for ten hours straight.  People can barely sit through a ten-hour flight without getting ansy let alone a movie.The acting all around, including the kids of Dumbledore's Army, was superb.  The Luna Lovegood girl was excellent.  The interpretation of Delores Umbridge was delightfully scary to me, especially the way she disciplined her students.  How freakishly calm and distressingly evil she was in her bureacratic pink and prim, Stepford Nazi kind of way.  Give that lady an Oscar.  She was creepy.I hope to see Helena Bonham Carter again as Beatrix LeStrange.  She was scary crazy...and cool!Daniel Radcliffe: He upped the ante.  Those trigger dream sequences and mental struggles were spot on, realistic and much better than what we saw in Goblet of Fire.  Good job!  Going on stage must have really helped.And who can discount the Wizard and Witches Battling--What incredible special effects!  I'll have to admit that does give Lord of the Rings a run for its money, and Lord of the Rings is a classic.  This movie is pretty intense emotionally and suspense wise.  It could classify as an action horror flick on its own.  It's sinster, sinister, sinister.  So Parents, it would be easy for me to say I'd be wary about bringing your little ones to this flick, but it's a Harry Potter film--which is a story about kids.  Go with them to watch it; there are some pretty intense and frightening scenes.Finally, hats off to director David Yates.  Excellent job and great editting.  At first I was not keen on the whole switching director thing, but it's really worked for the Potter series.  Potter endures a tremendous life change, and each director is able to bring out a particular significant vulnerability in Potter's life with each particular story.  Order needed an intense director for an intense storyline.  I wonder how Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows is going to turn out.[...]	5.0	Wicked!!	2007-07-20	11	8	3

I just never seemed to be interested until I got bitten by the bookworm last summer. I've been reading nonstop ever since and my favorite books are the HP books.  The first two HP movies followed the storylines pretty accurately in terms of physical details but couldn't really capture the necessary dark tone that is felt in the later movies.  However, I found the third and fourth movies very flawed because the storylines were significantly changed and/or important characters and scenes were omitted.For a book that is over 800 pages, the fifth HP movie was able to set a balance with the right tone, cinematography, character development, and story line.  I liked that the Deatheaters were given a more gothic appearance with rustic masks, not the tacky silicone looking ones like in the 4th HP movie.  In, the 4th movie, I was highly disappointed by the Voldemort graveyard scenes.  I couldn't take them seriously..everything looked too artifical, the colors looked too saturated.  The battle scenes in the 4th HP movie were laugable.  In this movie, the Dept. of Mysteries's scenes were perfect.  Sure, I wished the movie would have included 10 minutes more during the Dept. of Mysteries for more climax but I understand that there were budget restrictions and what not.  I actually thought that the movie was in some ways better than the book.  I loved the book, don't get me wrong but there were parts of the book that needed condensing and editing.  I like how the movie made Cho (instead of Cho's friend) the culprit for giving away the Room of Requirement and DA.  I also like how the scenes with Grawp and the conflict with the centaurs wasn't drawn out more than necessary.  Also, I think the movie did a good job in portraying the Ministry's control over Hogwarts over a few scenes(i.e. making more Ministry decrees and showing all the DA students scratching painfully away with quills in Umbridge's detention).  Overall, a very well made adaptation and am really looking forward to the next one coming out this July.	5.0	Best Harry Potter movie yet	2009-03-31	1	0	1

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AFM9DJYPNM7VT	"Goldencat ""Carla"""	"This was a huge disappointment. The first and third movies gave the most entertaining ride, I think, because they had positive elements that had some hope to offset the overshadowing of evil magicians, death, abusive parents, and school bullies. Phoenix seems like a moneymaker, not an attempt at giving fans a real value for their money.In addition, there was *no* positive influence in this film. Harry looses his godfather before his eyes, learns that Thestrals (demon-horses to students of the occult) are only visible ""if you have seen death"" and are what pull the coaches for the school. The inquisitor tortures Harry and classmates with written punishment that also writes the words in their flesh. He doesn't get to hear the whole prophecy about himself. It breaks and vaporizes. Yet again, he gets into trouble because he refuses to involve good adults, and the plot goes accordingly.There was little humor. Alot of darkness. Which might be expected, since JK said as much...and she is a respected (and rich!) black witch, after all. Her knowledge and oversight over the books and films are absolute, BTW, per contract. So we know there is much realism from a practitioner's POV.What audiences do with that knowledge is up to them. I only think it fair to let people know the ideology of the author, and what they are ingesting mentally as a result. She takes it seriously, it's not ""mere Hollywood"" to her. She is serious about her religion, and her occult worldview. What does that imply about content? Is it possible she is indoctrinating people who don't recognize her faith as readily as they would, say, Roman Catholicism or Islam? So they don't filter it out?I don't recommend HP to God-fearing people for those reasons. And for spiritual purity. The Lord, YHWH, hates witchcraft in all forms. If you use it to better understand the occult craze sweeping our culture, go ahead. Get the video ""Under the Spell of Harry Potter"" then. For *fun* watch the earlier (1-3) movies.Folks will still eat Twinkies and chips with Olestra, given the chance. But you can at least give a health warning :-) Think of Phoenix as Olestra Twinkies for it's weak storyline, whatever you decide about the religious witchcraft element."	1.0	Poor showing - unsatisfying ride - weakest of the films yet	2008-01-13	10	0	10

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A35KEBJ6YQQU5B	Greg Hayken	Maybe it's because I loved the book enough to buy IMAX tickets weeks in advance and stand in line for 2 hours for prime seating.  Maybe my expectations were a bit high.  But I found this movie to be terribly disappointing.It's as though the director sought to cover every chapter in the 800 page book in 2 hours.  The result was a lot of fast-paced nothingness.  The characters we love became two-dimensional because didn't have enough time to develop any believable emotional response.The director's desire to include as much of the book as possible resulted in the omitted scenes appearing even more obvious.  For example, Ginny spoke almost five words throughout the whole movie, despite being in half the scenes.Finally, as the movie was about to end, we come to the first real action scene: the battle in the Ministry of Magic.  What should have been a dramatic battle, with dueling and new spells we've never heard of, was short and too quickly resolved.  Isn't this what the whole book was leading to?  This great battle?  What about all the wonders of the Department of Mysteries we witnessed in the book?  Unfortunately, there was no magic in this movie.PROS: Performances by Helena Bonham Carter, Gary Oldman, and Evanna Lynch brought life into the otherwise dismal plot.CONS: The plot was rushed and uneventful; Characters were two-dimensional.	2.0	Short on Story, Short on Magic	2007-07-12	17	12	5

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2N3N439PRGV3I	Gregory Bravo	"I love Harry Potter, OK?  So before you freak out, let me get that out of the way.  The book version ""Order of the Phoenix"" was oustanding.  I also think that previous directors have done pretty good to great jobs of translating the books to film (though I must say things went a little downhill once Chris Columbus left.)All that being said, here's the kicker:The movie ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" played like a Cliff's Notes adaptation of the book.It lopped off a lot of the charm and romance and heartfelt pathos of the book--- as well as a lot of the pure creative touches--- in order to get the main arc of the story down.  On top of that, it made ""adaptations"" to the book in order to get the story moving along--- yet all these ""compromises"" were actually worse than what JK Rowling originally wrote!Don't believe me?  Here is only SOME of what is wrong with this movie:--Poor devlopment of the Harry/Cho Chang arc (The kiss is about all you get.  No real feeling behind it at all.  No devlopement of Harry's crush.  No final break up argument on Valentine's Day.)--Making Cho into an evil snitch (which is why she and Harry broke up in the movie.)  In the movie SHE is the one who betrays Harry. Stupid.--No hospital scenes.  No meeting of Neville's parents.--Perfunctory explanation of Grimmaud Place--Perfunctory development of Occlumency--Harry gets to hear the prophecy while standing in the Department of Mysteries rather than later with Dumbledore.  On top of this, he gets to hear the prophecy just by holding it in his hand.  That makes no logical sense at all!--The Department of Mysteries itself is compressed down into one room (the room with the prophecies.)  All the cool rooms (with the blue lights, the 12 doors, the clocks, the brains, and so on) are all just ignored.  Those were such tremendous inventions by JK Rowling--perhaps some of the most creative stuff in all the books-- that I can't believe they just cut them!--The room with the arch is made into a really boring place.--The battle scene is really short and rather stupid.--Snape's memory of being tortured by James Potter and his argument with Lily Potter is compressed into literally a total of 4 seconds of film.  That scence is so PIVOTAL to the rest of the book series that I can't believe they got away with not fully developing the scene.On top of all these plot issues, the WORST part about this movie is that there was really no FEELING in it.  The whole range of emotional arcs that are so well-developed in the book are done absolutely terribly in the movie.  Yeah, Sirius dies.  In the book, it is a devatating moment. In the movie, it's like ""Oh, well.""  Harry, Ron and Hermione don't have many moments together.  There is no laughing in the movie.  There are no lighthearted moments.  Almost every scene except one or two that could have developed the emotional attachment we feel to the characters has been summarily excluded.Like one other reviewer said: The movie is too short, yet it feels too long.That is, sorry to say, a perfect description of a hack job.I am quite disappointed."	2.0	Cliff's Notes Adaptation of the Book	2007-12-12	29	23	6

First-time series director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg present largely top-notch work.The movie's titular 'Order of the Phoenix' is an honor guard of highly decorated Hogwarts teachers and associates who have sworn to protect Harry from the growing threat of a strengthening Lord Voldemort.  In a choppy movie from a narrative point of view, the Order of the Phoenix itself is somewhat a victim of fast cuts and general shortcomings.  It does provide a window into Grimmauld Place, the expressively dark family manse of Harry's godfather Sirius Black.  Gary Oldman again delivers a nuanced performance in what is a very important film for his character.Simultaneously one of this movie's strengths and weaknesses, The Ministry of Magic ensures Harry will have enemies inside Hogwarts as well as outside of it.  Due to creative shortcuts, the Ministry is often glossed over in the film.  Ironically, in the book Ms. Rowling spends too much time expounding on it.  A balance could have and should have been achieved.  In the person of Dolores Umbridge, though, falsely sweet insincerity has a monstrous voice.  The name itself can mean 'painful offense.' Esteemed actress Imelda Staunton plays the character very well.Returning actors Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint again deliver natural camaraderie and acting skills, and are joined by returning colleagues Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore and Alan Rickman as Severus Snape.  Messrs Radcliffe and Rickman have an impressive scene together as Professor Snape ruthlessly attempts to train Harry to resist Voldemort's violent encroachments into his mind.Series newcomer Evanna Lynch makes a positive impression as Luna Lovegood, the offbeat sweetheart whose odd pronouncements always carry an ironic kernel of wisdom.  It's a difficult part to play believably, and Ms. Lynch does so extremely well.""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is very, very good."	4.0	"""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" overcomes some missteps to retain the overall series' high quality"	2011-07-19	1	1	0
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1TYKGNEBYLWSG	Grimes	A great deal of the community has been complaining that the Ultimate Editions have not been extended films after the release of the second film. In the case of Order of the Phoenix, an extended edition is virtually pointless. Before we get to that, let's discuss the packaging:The Ultimate editions come housed in a sleek slip cover that holds a small box. Inside this box we have a little hardcover photo album featuring behind the scenes captions, two lenticular cards (Lovegood and Umbridge) and two discs. One disc has the film while the other has the special features. As for special features, there aren't really any additional ones on top of the two-disc collector's edition from 2007. The newest addition is the hour long documentary part Evolution which is another great installment of the eight part documentary series that can only be found in the Ultimate Editions. The picture quality is wonderful on the Blu-Ray editions. The special feature disc is also Blu-Ray which is a nice touch.As for the film. Order of the Phoenix is the longest Potter book and the shortest film (until Deathly Hallows Part II comes out). The important plot points have all been carried over from the book but it lacks the extra detail that allows us to feel immersed in the wizarding world. There are a few changes that were for the better (in terms of what works on film) and some for the worst. In short, I like the Order of the Phoenix film but I do not think it is the best in terms of adaptation.As for the question of waiting out for an extended edition that is not coming. If we review the removed scenes from Order of the Phoenix we only find ONE scene that is worthy of being integrated into the film. It is an extended look at Umbridge inspecting Trelawney's classroom. It would add a couple minutes to the running time but I do not think it is worth making an extended edition over.The film: 3/5The set: 5/5	5.0	The Ultimate Edition is Fantastic	2011-06-27	2	0	2

Basically, it seems like they did a shoddy job of encoding it for DVD. One wonders if it was purposefully done to encourage people to buy Blu-Ray discs. On my HD TV, the video quality is pretty pixelated and shadow areas have too much noise in them. I have other DVDs that look much, MUCH better on my TV because the information on the actual DVD's is of much higher quality. If you wondered why the price is this cheap, you now know.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2HVL790PBWYTU	"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read"""	"Welcome to this long-winded mess of words. And, if you haven't read the book, there's plenty of plot SPOILERS.Having read all of the books at least three times each, I'm a bonafide fan of Harry Potter. And, as the end draws near for this book series, I'm starting to wonder what life would be like without a new Potter entry to look forward to. For years now, with each additional chapter in the life of the Boy Who Lived, J.K. Rowling has brought anticipation and glee into my life. But it's almost done now. It's a reality which looms ever closer, even as Warner Brothers, already looking ahead and thirsting for that next blockbuster franchise, stakes its claim on children's author Angie Sage's Septimus Heap series. Life will go on, of course, because, in the scheme of things, it's really not that big of a deal. And, sure as rain, something'll come to fill in that void, although I doubt it'll be Septimus Heap. Meanwhile, there's this movie that just came out.HARRY POTTER & THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, at a running time of 2 hours and 18 minutes, dares to be briefer than the other Potter films. It's also even darker as it deals quite heftily with Harry's volatile teenaged angst, as well as the steadily worsening climate in the Potter universe. In the prior film,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Two-Disc Special Edition) (Harry Potter 4), Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) returned to the flesh and celebrated the act with murder. He even had a magical tussle with Harry. But, as ORDER OF THE PHOENIX commences, it's evident as hell that no one but a loyal few believes Harry's story. As Harry later pens to his godfather Sirius Black, even though Harry is back at Hogwarts, he has never felt more alone.The movie begins, of course, with Harry pining and resenting away in sweltering London (his buds have been incommunicado). When he's forced to utilize his Patronus charm on two Dementors to save himself and his bullying cousin Dudley, this becomes a frowned-upon feat deemed worthy of expulsion from Hogwarts. He does get out of that scrape, thanks to a strangely distant Dumbledore, who pleads Harry's case to the Ministry of Magic and then stalks away, leaving Harry futilely calling out his name. Reinstated at Hogwarts, Harry continues to have nightmares about a mysterious door, which then leads him to believe that he has a frightening mental link to Lord Voldemort. Too, Harry's hormones are raging and he persists in a foul mood until an unexpected new friend straightens him out.Meanwhile, all is not right at Hogwarts. The head of the Ministry of Magic, paranoid in these nerve-wracking times and fearing Dumbledore's vast influence, gets a foot in Hogwarts' door by assigning a toadie as the school's new  teacher for Defense Against the Dark Arts. This person is Dolores Umbridge, officious and pink-clad. Professor Umbridge, breathily vile and prim-and-properly vindictive, does away altogether with practical, hands-on magic learning and, in one quietly chilling scene, punishes Harry for being outspoken. As her status at Hogwarts grows, it becomes clear that, with apologies to Lord Voldemort, Dolores Umbridge is the true centerpiece villain of the film.Somewhat lurking in the background, the Order of the Phoenix - the secret society formed to combat and foil Lord Voldemort - continues to affect Harry's life, as more than a few of its members consist of folks near and dear to Harry. The Order makes noise in the beginning and in the climax, but disappears somewhat in the film's middle as the focus shifts to the doings in school. Hermione, alarmed that the students are rendered vulnerable with the lack of training, convinces a reluctant Harry to become, on the sly, their new teacher for Defense Against the Dark Arts. These students call themselves Dumbledore's Army, the core members of which will be later severely tested in a life-or-death wizardly struggle. But, before that, they still have to pass their O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels) exams.I went into this screening pretty stoked but not as excited as I perhaps could've been. I was much aware that this film is the lesser of the two upcoming, back-to-back Harry Potter events. Make no mistake, the seventh book is the BIGGER deal and the knowledge of its imminent release took some gloss away from my excitement in this film.Yet, I liked this film, and very much. I like it almost as much as the 3rd and 4th installments, which I thought were the best ones. So, with a few caveats, HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX is a very worthwhile entry in the series. The innocence is gone in this series, of course, having been irrevocably crushed with Cedric Diggory's murder in the GOBLET OF FIRE. Absolutely, the films faithfully echo the progressively grimmer tone and mood of the books. And this one is the darkest yet. However, the film still carries moments of zest, such as the Weasley twins' liberating final act of defiance (but where were the swamps?). On occasion, it still cavorts in enchanted whimsy (Umbridge's commemorative plates of cats, the students' Patronus guises). The special effects remain spectacular and, particularly in this movie, serve to briskly move the plot along.The kids are growing up. What we have here is a Harry who's portrayed as realistically as you can get, given the fantastic world he inhabits. Daniel Radcliffe flexes his acting chops and simmers and glowers as young Harry, now fifteen but feeling more isolated than ever and going thru what every fifteen-year-olds go thru, except more so. The rest of the kids are maturing nicely, with Emma Watson still leading the pack in terms of presence and quality of performance. Rupert Grint, he ain't bad, either. Newcomer Evanna Lynch as the wonderfully wonky Luna Lovegood is a welcome addition (but, what is a ""nargle,"" exactly?). The last of the kids to make an impression is Matthew Lewis as the hapless Neville Longbottom, for whom I believe J .K. Rowling has plans.All Shakespearean stage and film adaptations in England must've been put on the backburner as just about every middle-aged Brit actor seems to have poked his or her head thru this particular door (What's Patrick Stewart waiting for?). Not enough of the old reliables get decent screen time, mind you, but Imelda Staunton as  Dolores Umbridge does much to make up for that. I haven't seen anyone convey such sadistic, yet oh-so-polite bureaucractic malice since the last time I was at the DMV. Meanwhile, Helena Bonham Carter, also a freshman here, simply revels in gothic villainy as the unhinged Bellatrix Lestrange. More of her would've been a very good thing.No, it's not a perfect film. It's definitely not for newcomers to the Harry Potter mythos or for those who haven't read the books. The scene transitions are sometimes choppy and disconcerting. People show up without an intro and move in and out of the screen, leaving the audience to follow along, which is no biggie for the constant reader/viewer but might leave rookies to the series scratching their heads. I walked away with this feeling that the film was too short and a bit abrupt. With the book nearly at 900 pages, there's simply no way to include and then amply cover all the fun stuff and the key moments. Frankly, I expected more of the Weasly twins' final rebellious prank at Hogwarts, but, alas, there wasn't enough all-out anarchy in their festivities. Also, an important element - Sirius's growing recklessness and feelings of moroseness and futility - is barely touched on. Not to mention, the film deals differently with the ferreting out of Dumbledore's Army. And not enough Room of Requirement. But the most galling thing about this film (and the book, too, come to think of it): no friggin' Quidditch! But, you do get to see Harry and Cho snogging under a mistletoe.Enough of my yak. This is a four star motion picture, leaner and meaner, starring your favorite, lightning scarred boy wizard. The film series has now gotten to that stage where sleeves are tugged up and knuckles are cracked, all in preparation for some serious work ahead. Time to get down and dirty. So, climb onboard. The end may be around the corner, but, for now, the series is picking up some serious momentum.Meanwhile, make sure the nargles are kept away, whatever they are."	4.0	I didn't realize pink was the color of evil	2007-07-13	4	3	1

We are definitely rental people since there are very few movies I want to see more than once but this one we own.  I have probably seen this one about five times and think it's great each and every time.My view is that you have to look at the movie as if it's a movie - not the book come to life.  A movie cannot possibly contain all that is in a massive book and the viewer shouldn't expect that.  As a stand-alone movie, it's wonderful!  My husband and one of my best friends have never read a HP book and still thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  My daughter and I are avid HP fans reading all the books multiple times and we love the movie -- that's pretty high praise in my book.  Once you view the movie after reading all seven books, you can see where there are subtle hints of what is to come but those would be almost impossible to notice if you haven't completed the series.The books get darker as the series progresses and that is reflected in the movies.  There is more violence and tension in this movie which makes it one that shouldn't be watched by small children.  Nothing gorry, but still pretty intense for young kids.	5.0	Definitely one to watch multiple times	2009-07-13	0	0	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A29UO9GBSQXS72	Horror Spooky	The tagline might have your jaw drop, but I stand by the statement and it is completely and utterly true. I have read all of the Harry Potter books, and I always found Order of the Phoenix to be a downright drag that was far too long and far too boring. However, this film adaptation really takes the best and most important parts of the book and puts it on the big screen in quite the perfect fashion.What I really like about this film is the dialogue is really well written and all of the actors play their parts spectacularly. Umbridge is an evil witch and she's the perfect antagonist throughout the story, and everyone from Dumbledore to Fudge does a great job during their screen time. The famous and memorable musical score created for the first film is intact for Order of the Phoenix and it's still just as awesome as it has been for the previous four years.But what keeps this film from being perfect? The CGI is still not the best. Granted, the Potter films stay away from CGI for a majority of the films (WHICH I LOVE...THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!), but when there is CGI, it generally looks rather pathetic. Still, there are some cool special effects to enjoy that will astonish you, even if you're some big film buff that thinks they've seen it all.The plot moves along at a rather quick pace, but not quick to the point that it's jarring. I'd say the plot moves perfectly, with enough action and emotion mixed in with some humor and character development. One of the most shocking moments of the film is, for some reason or another, really not given that much importance or screen time. Missed opportunity, but it doesn't ruin the film in the least.You'll love this film whether you're a Harry Potter fan or not. It was done masterfully, with my gripes being some untaken chances with the plot and the poor CGI in some areas. Still, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a roller coaster ride of magic and mayhem in the kind of way that only Potter can provide.	4.0	The movie's better than the book	2009-07-25	0	0	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3F3B6HY9RJI04	James Duckett	"A lot of my annoyances in previous Harry Potter movies have been the changes, diversion, and other ""artistic privileges"" taken while adapting the book into a movie.Of the five Harry Potter movies thus far, I think this one stayed more true to the book than any of the others.  And let me tell you, that means a lot to me.Otherwise, there were very few other flaws.The acting was fantastic.  These kid actors have really graduated into true actors.  Of all of them, I think there was only one who was a little bit too over-the-top still.  But Daniel Radcliff as Harry Potter was spot-on.  Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley could not have done a better job as Harry's most noble friend and protector.Two performances really stood out for me.  The first was Gary Oldman who has always been a standout performer.  I think he really outdid himself as Harry's Godfather, Sirius Black.  It is too bad that this will be his last appearance in these films unless there is something I don't know about in the seven book (9 more days!!!  I can't wait!).  The other performance was by the newcomer of the series, Evanna Lynch, who could not have played the ""dreamy"" Luna Lovegood any better.  She did a fantastic job and I look forward to seeing her throughout the rest of the series.The special effects were awesome, especially with the showdown between Dumbledore and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the end of the movie.  I think the entire theater were on the edge of their seats!  Also, the training of Dumbledore's Army was beautifully done.Like the books and the other movies, there was a lot of good humor throughout the movie.  The scene I was most looking forward to was the scene involving the twins when they can't take the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher anymore.  The entire theater was laughing their heads off.  It was great and couldn't have been done better.  That scene was one of the highlights this gem of a movie.I now remember one of my frustrations when I reviews this book when it first came out, and that was how emotionally charged Harry Potter was.  I thought he spent the first half of the book just being a jerk.  The movie actually did a better job than the book of showing WHY he was upset and angry and overly emotional.  Again, I think the fine talents of Gary Oldman helped with this.  But the director did a fantastic job of actually SHOWING us what Harry Potter was going through and why he was so emotionally charged.I think in the end, this will be one of the stronger movies.  Those who have read the book will finally have a movie to see they won't be groaning to throughout.  I was glad to hear the same director (David Yates) will helm the next movie and I hope he continues the excellent work he put into this movie.This easily deserves five stars!"	5.0	A True Adaption	2007-07-12	5	4	1
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A11G5FN9FTO6RG	"James F. Todd ""floog"""	I will now be looking forward to receiving yet another replacement for this disc - I'll be on my third copy.  Apparently the process of creating combo discs that work in HD-DVD drives and regular DVD drives is flawed, and involves basically gluing two discs together.  The first disc played until 1:50 into the film, then tiled horribly then froze completely.  The second made it only to 1:05 before doing the same.  Both were reproducible errors.  They have done a horrible job in terms of quality of manufacturing..the movie was great, if I could actually watch it all...avoid this until they can make these well.EDIT: This is apparently very widespread, and is now a thread on engadgetHD - this combo disc is poorly made, and many users are finding that it won't play without freezing.  This is true not only on the Xbox 360 add-on, but also found to be true on my A3 model.  It's not the hardware - it's this disc being poorly made.	1.0	Combo Format Prone to Failures - Beware	2007-12-14	29	13	16

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AG5QBLBYIYC4C	"Jamieson Villeneuve ""Author at Large"""	I was given Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on DVD. My husband Robert gave it to me as a cheer up present. He went the extra mile and got me the special two disc edition, knowing that I am a Special Features Junkie.I have three addictions in life. Four if you count Chocolate. But the first three are: Harry Potter, Books and Special Features. I love DVD extras. They really enable you to see what the film could have been, what was left out.I think of them as little lost treasures, little bits of fun.Now, having watched Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, I can truly say that it is by far the best film in the series. It's fresh, engaging, moving, and beautiful. I loved watching it more the second time on DVD than I did when I saw it the first time.This may have something to do with the fact that, in the theatre, there was a gentleman behind me that talked through the entire bloody thing. Or maybe because when I got to watch it at home, it was on a new twenty six inch screen; but I digress.I was all excited to look at the Special Features after watching the film. The Husband (Hello Husband!) went off to do his thing. I popped in the second disc of the DVD, preparing myself to be enraptured.Previous DVD editions of the movie have included games, maps, Triwizard Tournament Challenges, Potion Making Classes, a spidery maze, hidden extras and more. So imagine my surprise when I popped in the second DVD and saw a menu of only five things:Languages, The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter, Tour with Tonks and The Magic of Editing.Measly fare at best. Where were the games, where were the extras, the fun stuff? Where were the Special Features that really helped me get behind the film. Nowhere I could see. I took a cursery glance through everything and announced it all tosh.As it turned out, I was wrong. Very wrong indeed.There are a lot of people out there writing bad reviews about the two disc special edition of the DVD and I was almost one of them, had I not taken the time to wait. Enjoying a day off today, I saw the DVD sitting there by my television and decided to pop it in.I figured that I'd put on one of the features and it would be lovely, magical background noise as I cleaned the apartment and had a helping of my Husbands amazing meat loaf (seriously folks, it would make your mouth water; yep, it's that good).That didn't happen at all.I had already taken a quick look at The Magic of Editing Feature. A boring little documentary about editing a film. Watching television last night, I saw an add for the DVD where it mentioned being able to edit your own scene.Hold on a second, edit my own what? I figured that since there was no other choice on the menu, The Magic of Editing would be where it was. So I watched the documentary. It was a revelation of what kind of work goes into giving us the film that we see. Quite enjoyable too.At the end of this segment, you do actually get to edit your own scene, choosing camera angle, music and sound effects. Then comes the fun part: you get to play it back and watch what you put together.It's like directing your own movie; sort of. I had a great time putting the scene together different ways. Just enjoy the Feature and then let the editing magic begin.I was also prepared not to enjoy the additional scenes. I don't know why. I know it had a lot to do with my pre-conceived notions of the second disc not being enjoyable. So I pressed play and watched them.I came away spellbound. It really is a shame that most of the scenes were cut from the final reels. They would have added warmth and depth to some of the performances, both small and large.Emma Thompson in particular is amazing. There are a few more scenes with her: one in a comedic turn at the Welcome Feast that is worth the entire price of the DVD (I'm not kidding, she's that funny) and a later scene that concerns Divination.She is surpurb as always but she really shines in these scenes, as she does in the actual film when Umbridge attempts to have her thrown out of Hogwarts. Imelda Staunton, who plays Professor Umbridge brilliantly in the film, has an extended scene right before she is accosted by the Centaurs.Her speech is perhaps one of the best movie monologues that I have ever heard. It shows her depth of character, the depth of her evil, the depth of her desperation. Staunton gives one hell of a performance and it's a shame that it was cut from the movie.We see a brief flash of Michael Gamdon as Dumbledore. We sense his lonliness, the separation between Dumbledore and Harry. It's brief but brilliant.I can appreciate why the scenes were cut however, after having watched The Magic of Editing. The pieces, while wonderful, would have slowed down the original pace and tone of the film; it would have made the movie heavy. Being the shortest of the five movies, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix flies along at a fantastic pace.While Tour with Tonks was cute, I really did enjoy The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter after I gave it a chance. Yes, the information is outdated, the effects kind of hokey, but it was perfectly enjoyable on a cold day with a bowl of popcorn.I also understand why they've put it together. A large portion of the audience have read the books.But a large portion of the movie audience hasn't. They've ingeniously weaved all the secrets that the reading audience have gained through the books and presented them all in a way suitable for those who have only watched the movies. It's a little flashy but wonderfully done.All of these special features add to the film, add to the experience. They make the DVD worth having, contrary to those who would speak against it. I've had a thoroughly enjoyable world in the land of Harry Potter and I plan to return quite soon.This is the perfect treat for your loved one; or for yourself for that matter. Just sit back, and enjoy. What could be better than that?	5.0	Incredible!	2008-03-19	3	2	1

It seems that a movie looses something.  Maybe my imagination is more vivid than that a director can show on a screen.  This is not the case with the Harry Potter Movies.  They all show aspects of the text that I missed when reading the book.  The imagination of this director and the author is out of this world.One drawback though - the books are popular for children as we all know.  I find that the movies are getting 'darker' as they progress.  I wouldn't recommend the latest movies to anyone that is 13 or younger.  My little ones had nightmares after seeing the last one.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2GW1DBM406VU1	"Jarrett P. Suhr ""naraku junior"""	This movie has been drastiucally cut from the book but still the scenes not cut are phonimally well couragraphed and the musice is awasome.The best of the five scores that I have heard so far. Though Harry potter V  lacks some of intensity of the last film Goblet of Fire had midway through it. It makes up however with decent acting and phonimal special effectss. But some parts needed to be removed or shorten to speed up the movie.  Th scene when harry is put on trial for using a protnaus charm when he and his mean cousin doudley are attacked by dementors. Unfortunately some of the vitally important scene like Harry going to the department of Minstry was drastically altered from the book and sirus blacks role was drastically reduce to speed up the plot. As well which may have spoiled this film for some of Fans of the series who had to high expectatios. Other than several other changes and some other parrts that were cut out including Harry being banned from Quiditch as one of his punishments for try to tell the truth. Depsite this the film is still phonimally good or a stinko ro depending on how high your expectations are. So you will either fall in love with this film our you'll want to take a flamethrower to it depends on what your expantations are. After Harry break the laws of underage sorcery he is put on trial and almost thrown out of school. But the charges are over thrown he goes back to school. In the book this scene went on forever. Cornelous Fudge is so desperate to keep his job and to keep Harry quiet he even uses past magical violations of Harry Potter's including the infamous floating cake done by Dobby the house elf to get Harry Potter convicted. Unfortunaely he fales to persuade enough of the Jury in both the film and book. We also get a new teacher Proffesor Umbrige from Harry's trial becomes the new defense against the dark arts teacher she makes life miserable for the students especialy Harry Potter. Even though at least half of her cruel and sinster rules and tutor scenes were cut out you will loave her from beginning to end making her the perfect villian. You actually barely see Voldermort in any of the movies he usually does not appear until the finally of ever movie except Prizonner of Askaban in which he was excluded and replace with Wormtail instead at the end of the finally. You she him sliglyt more in this one and in the Goblet of Fire but not much. Can Harry figure out what the vision he is seeing are and what Voldermort is up to before its to late. Will the school find away to ride it of the  vile and wretched Proffesor Umbridg and hat fate lies in store for the current Secret society or Order of the phonix members? To find out these answers read Harry Potter and the half blood prince and the Deathly Hallows to find out what becomes of the order. To find out if Voldermort's plains for this installement succeds find out in the thrilling action packed and tear jerking conclusion to this 2005 clasic movie. Will Harry stop Voldermort and what terrible price will he have to pay stop the mysterious item located deep in the depths of the Depapartment of Mysters from falling into Voldermort's filth, vile, and wrinkly hands.	5.0	A phonominal film despite the massive alturations and abriging of scenes.	2008-01-09	1	0	1

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2OU415LB9I5J6	Jason C. Wilkerson	A lot has changed in the wizarding world during the summer between Harry's fourth and fifth years at Hogwarts. Voldemort is back, but not in the open, and the ministry is ignoring it. The Minister of Magic feels threatened by Dumbledore and Potter and has been exerting control over the wizarding press to make it seem like they are both insane liars. This somber turn of events allows Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix to discuss deeper topics than in previous Harry Potter installments; topics like government corruption and control, freedom of the press, corporal punishment, etc. The film also examines public responsibility in the midst of totalitarian government through the lens of Harry, Hermoine, and Ron's underground Defense of the Dark Arts class known as Dumbledore's Army. Hefty material for a series most people look at as children's fantasy fiction, huh?Teens approaching Harry Potter's age already deal with issues of rebellion and angst, but in times as hard as those facing Harry in Phoenix, those feelings are heightened. When I first read the book I thought that Harry was being a bit of a brat throughout this installment, but now I realize is the magnitude of what he was dealing with. He saw the most dangerous wizard of all time rise from a place between death and life and watched him murder a fellow classmate, yet no one believes him when he recounts this information.  Dumbledore, Harry's mentor and father figure, seems to completely ignore him, and the government interferes with the dealings of Hogwarts, the one place Harry holds sacred. Radcliffe does a great job at giving life to Harry's turmoil during this installment, and it seems that the entire youthful cast is continuously growing as actors. I'm sure working with several directors and brilliant veteran actors helped them through the process.Once again, a new director takes over the reigns of the series in Phoenix. The choice of David Yates as the fourth and final director of the series was kind of a surprise. Prior to Order of the Phoenix Yates had only directed television movies, so many people were unsure about this somewhat untested talent. There was no need to worry in my opinion. Not only did Yates make one of the best movies of the series, he also turned the longest Harry Potter book into the shortest movie without making it feel rushed or leaving any plot holes.Mostly featuring returning cast members that were basically absent for an installment (Gary Oldman has a much bigger part, and David Thewlis is back after being absent from Goblet of Fire), Order of the Phoenix doesn't contain very many new characters, but the few that are there represent quite a coup d'etat in casting. Finding newcomer Evanna Lynch for the role of Luna Lovegood was a brilliant feat in and of itself, and the role of Professor Umbridge is brilliantly played by Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton (Vera Drake, Freedom Writers), who brings Umbridge's toad-like qualities to life. Also joining the cast is the always marvelous Helena Bonham Carter (Fight Club, Hamlet) as the evil Bellatrix Lestrange.I find this film to be better than Goblet of Fire, but it's still not without its failings. Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore still doesn't match up to J.K. Rowling's description of the character. While better than he was in the previous film, Gambon's Dumbledore still  doesn't create an impression of being the greatest wizard alive. I was also disappointed that certain details concerning the prophecy didn't make it into the film. In the book, you learn that the prophecy didn't explicitly mean that Harry would be Voldemort's enemy, but that it could have applied to another student at Hogwarts. It's not central to the plot, but I felt this was an interesting fact that viewers of the movie who haven't read the books missed out on.Critically, Order of the Phoenix is at the low end of the Potter films, tied for last place with Philosopher's Stone. At the box office, it continued the rise in box office receipts started with Goblet of Fire, surpassing it to become the second- highest grossing film of the series and of the year, with $938.2 million grossed worldwide. As this occurred with a summer release, those who thought that Prisoner of Azkaban grossed lower due to the release date were proven wrong. Of course, with its shorter run time and what is arguably the most brilliant scene of the series, Order of the Phoenix turned into quite the overall success.	4.0	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix	2010-11-24	2	1	1
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A391BK22TCPSLK	Jason Winningham	The only complaint I have with this movie version is the same that I have for the past 2 HP movies....DUMBLEDORE!For some reason the Dumbledore in the movies is trying to create his own character and has not done any research into his role. If he has, then he is a bad actor. But since he portrays Dumbledore as this figure that freaks out if Harry has put his name in the cup (Goblet of Fire), and has this battle with Tom Riddle wherein he almost loses and is freaked out the whole time (WAY NOT ACCURATE), he has obviously no clue that Dumbledore WOULDN'T behave that way.I hope they either get a new Dumbledore before the next movie or the one they have learns the part better.	5.0	Dumbledore - BAD	2007-08-16	9	5	4

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3UT05OPWETMKJ	Jax25	So this is a review of the Ultimate Edition Blu-Ray and I'll admit, I've only gotten around to purchasing Chamber of Secrets in Ultimate Edition prior to this.  However, with the start of the Ultimate Editions, they were released as extended director's cuts of the movies that included the deleted scenes.  That was the main draw for me.  The other bonus content is nice and all, but what real incentive is there to buy yet another bluray edition of what I already have?  The main reason I got OOTP in this edition was that I was hoping to see the scene from Malfoy Manor that we all know they cut out of the film because we've seen the pictures of Lucius looking all swank with his two deer hounds by his side. In a fan video from back when the movie came out Jason Isaacs said that he thought it would be in the deleted scenes for the DVD.  Was it?  Nope.  And did I get to see the scene here?  Nope.  Just the theatrical release yet again.So yeah...if I had this to buy all over again would I?  Maybe...but just to complete the set.  I certainly wouldn't have gone out of my way to buy it before I'd had the other movies in the series.  And if you've already got the blu-ray and don't care about some random special features, I'd suggest a pass.	3.0	I was expecting extended edition...	2011-06-30	3	3	0

As the movie studios scuffle over which HD bandwagon to get on this year, Warner figures they'll help their HD hardware brethren by releasing newER DVD titles purposely watered down. The consumer is stupid and they'll never notice such subtleties, right? Hell, the compression is so bad I can actually count the pixels in Daniel Radcliffe's face (hmm...1, 2, 3...3?).And to think I'm watching this on a 1080p set with an upscaling player. Imagine what it looks like without the help of an upscaler!Anyway...Review?

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A29LK7QM8XVLCK	J. Conaway	I am a huge Harry Potter fan and enjoyed every word of every book.  But I absolutely hated this movie.  I know a movie can never capture all of the details and character development of a book, but it still needs to stay true to the essence of the book we all have come to love.  This movie depicted Dumbledore as a very grumpy, almost mean, old man who displayed none of Dumbledores lovable qualities.  The movie destroyed the relationship of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  It depicted Ron and Hermione as stiff cardboard figures that stood behind Harry and looked concerned. I could go on and on with things that disturbed me about this movie.  But if you are a Harry Potter fan, you will have to watch it.  But this fan was extremely disappointed.	2.0	Love the book - hate the movie.	2008-01-04	4	2	2

Only criticism with the movie would be it could have been longer without a negative effect to develop areas of the story that were rushed over in relation with the book. The DVD quality is the WORST I've seen in modern transfers, in fact, it's worse than any classic film transfers I can think of. Completely distracting and soured the experience. Warner Bros. should be embarrased and offer a recall, seriously it is terrible. This was viewed on a 55"" Sony WEGA which all HD and other standard defintion DVD look great on. Stay away from the standard dvd until they've fixed it, or go with Blu-Ray or HD DVD if you've got that option.Edit: Contacted Warner Brothers and they are sending a replacement DVD, they did not indicate any knowledge of a defective batch of copies however.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3GFZ9E2O2J5O2	Jeffrey Birou	"I agree with the majority of options here regarding the undeveloped plot, so I won't rehash them too much.  I should say, to be fair, that there are some really great performances in this film, especially Imelda Staunton as Professor Umbridge, andalso Daniel Radcliffe and Ralph Fiennes.  Unfortunately, the film is cut so bare-bones that we lose many (assumedly) great performances from the likes of Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and even Michael Gambon.  Character development is lost for plot advancement, which will hurt the impact of the final two films, in my opinion.Of course, I'm an obsessive completist (and admit to being a hypocrite feeding the machine), so I planned to purchase this film anyway (and felt justified enough because of the solid performances mentioned above).  Once I popped the film into my DVD player, though, I was shocked at how awful this transfer was: the picture is incredibly grainy (which was not intention like in some movies, like the ""Ocean's"" films).  I cannot believe that Warner Bros. would put out such a poor-quality release, especially for one of their strong franchise titles, and especially for the two-disc edition, where they're asking consumers to pay more (for something we used to get for free just a few years ago, but I digress...).I hope against hope that Warner Bros. announces a recall for this batch of DVDs.  It's a shame that any film--let alone one of their most successful films of the year--would get such a transfer."	2.0	Terribly Grainy Picture	2007-12-18	1	1	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1RSXP7MB772E3	"Jeff W. Shimkus ""Movie Manji"""	I have never read any of the books. I do read, just haven't read Harry yet. But when you disregard any notion that this movie belongs solely to please those that are fans of the book you have a phenomenal display of magic and deep characterization that leads to a dark, tense film with enemies and a plot worth exploring. This film benefits from the most updated technology that swarms your vision with more colors than possessed in the most colorful rainbow. They broadcast(at least for me) a field of ambiance that has rarely been shown before. It makes me beg for the crystal clear brilliance of HD, or blue ray. The climatic duel near the end between wisened powerhouses was comparible to the lightsaber fight/orchestration at the end of RETURN OF THE JEDI. I was that enthralled. And the more aggitated Harry went along, a kettle boiling over, the more they hinted that Harry may not be the savior after all, the more I was attatched to the human storyline. All this being said, I suppose it's impossible to dismiss the quality of the book for those who adore them and have endured the endless pages by their favorite author, and to those hordes of people I sympathize by saying I understand completely. But at least you have more to come, be optimistic for the sixth movie. They may succomb to your desires and make it eleven hours long.	5.0	Just a fan of the movie	2007-12-27	0	0	0

As you know, Warner Brothers has officially announced the Ultimate Editions of years 5 and 6. The product descriptions are quite wordy. There's a lot of talk about how fans should be excited about these new releases. But there are two words missing from the descriptions of both these products: Extended Cut.What sold me and so many other fans was the extended cuts. And so I began collecting the Ultimate Editions. And what excited me even more was the idea of more extended cuts to come, especially for The Order of the Phoenix.Then Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblit of fire Ultimate Editions came out, and of course, there were no extended cuts. And Warner Bros. spun us a tale of directors and their creative preferences. And so, we all said ""fair enough"" (although I, for one, never quite bought that explanation). Still, I had hopes for Order of the phonex and Half blood prince. Director David Yates is on record talking about having to cut 45 minutes from The Order of the Phoenix. And yet, here we are again with no extended cut to speak of. I'm sure the studio will spin us a tale of how busy Yates has been with the final installment of the franchise, thus making it impossible to return to these previous films and give the fans what they want,AN EXTENDED CUT.I understand Warner Bros. desire to get these editions on the shelves before the final film hits theaters. As for me, I would gladly wait a year for these editions if it meant getting to see extended cuts of the films. But this is not about the fans. This is about the bottom line. If the WB can get a half-@$$ product onto the shelves sooner, and therefore presumably make more money in the final season of Potter movie mania, then who cares what the fans want? We will buy anything with the word Ultimate in front of it. Or maybe not."	1.0	No Extended Cut	2011-03-15	201	173	28

For those who have read this book (which is phenominal, by the way!), this movie is missing absolutely everything. And for those who haven't read the book, this movie is completely and utterly confusing. There is no character development whatsoever, not even with Ron & Hermione. I think Luna and Neville had more lines than 80% of the key characters. This movie is missing everything important, yet it is so jumbled and has so much crammed into it that your brain is spinning.

I bought it for $12.99,totally awesome price. i'm glad that the last book will be made into two movies. They cut out so much from all the rest of the films...they have a free digital copy included Windows Media compatible only. haven't used it yet hope it works. i tried doing the edit your own scene thing, couldn't figure out how to select music and view right, guess i'll try that later... not much else comes with the movie. Seen all the deleted scenes on youtube and there's a tour of the studio with tonks you get to see Neville and Dean play a game badly outside the studio I thought that was cute... But the tour was kinda boring. They also talk about what may happen in the 7th film and what's happend in the 5 films so far (i know all that already).

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2JNJA81LTJTFX	JMAC044	For the real HP fans, that was the whole purpose of getting the ultimate editions; to see the the movies in their ultimate and complete form.  It simply indicates a lack of understand on the part of WB regarding their real audience.  Collector cards and fancy boxes might be great for the kids, but most of us bought the ultimate edition for the full movie.  One more thought from a fan.  Up until HP and the Deathly Hallows P1, the earlier movies have remained pretty true (if not complete) to their books.  Not so with HP and the Deathly Hallows P1. (Harry not disguised at the wedding; Harry and Herminoe not not under the clock when they entered Godrick's Hallow, the real reason the Lovegood's home was destroyed, etc.)  Although a good movie, I hope they do a better job with part 2.	1.0	Very disappointed.	2011-04-24	5	3	2

So why haven't they made it a little longer and made it more coherent??Even if you have NOT read the book you will notice connections missing, in appearance of characters who are there and you don't know why really and how they happened to be - Luna Lovegood, for instance.Actions follow one another seemingly disconnected while we KNOW how connected everything is in HP..Now that i'm done whining, i'll say that the film is worth seeing whether you are afficionado or not, for its brilliant casting.Snape, Black, Umbridge, McGonagall, Lestrange, Lovegood - brilliant!!!Radclife looks funniest of all the kids, gone all adolescent and staying shortest of them all.Effects are of high standard as always.. but here i have to go back to the whining - IN SHORT: while the HP1 was almost as good as the book played in my head, with HP5 it's not the case. The movie my head played out ofthe book is so much better than the one i saw on screen last week..	4.0	the book cut so bad it makes half sense	2007-07-23	4	3	1
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	ALAXP7TR9PAKY	J. Marcucci	Let me start out by saying that I am a huge fan of the books (have read all seven at least three times each).  This movie was much better than Goblet of Fire (then again, all the other movies were better than GOF), but it did dissapoint due to it's short running time (so much of OOTP had to be cut out).  However, director David Yates did do a good job of covering most of the major points of the book (and let's face it, after that chunk of dung GOF movie that Mike Newell directed, anything would have to be a step up).The special effects in the movie were great, and the epic battle scenes at the Ministry of Magic were surprisingly good.  I found that non-fans of the books could still watch this movie and be able to follow along to a certain extent.One last thing, I can't understand for the life of me why Warner Bros continues to cast Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore.  It is quite obvious (through his protrayal of Dumbledore in Movies 3-5) that this man has never even read the Harry Potter books, as he does a horrible job playing his role.  It really is a shame that Richard Harris had to pass away (sigh), but in Order of the Phoenix, Gambon proves once again that he is clearly unable to play the role of Dumbledore properly.Overall though, this movie was better than 4 and 3, but not as good as the first two movies.	3.0	Much better than Goblet of Fire, still not as good as SS or COS.	2007-11-15	0	0	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A35BSZORDA51XD	J. Newton	This is in my opinion the worst of the Potter films so far. It was a huge mistake to have brought in a new director for this project. The whole feel and flow of the film is awkward; familiar and loved characters are reintroduced perfunctorally without any magic and warmth; and the editing feels disjointed and rushed. There is no cohesiveness to the whole story. When abridging and translating a book to a film, care must be shown to the surviving source material. Let's hope this director aquits himself well if indeed he will be helming Potter 6. Still, 4 great films out of 5 is a good track record.	2.0	Ineptitude in Insight	2007-11-19	6	2	4

With apologies to everyone who thought it was wonderful, I found it disappointing, disjointed and confusing.  The rapidity with which the action developed and new characters appeared with little or no exposition was unsettling. My husband, a slight HP fan who enjoyed the previous movies, remarked on the way home he'd understood very little of the plot. When I explained the relationships between some of the characters and provided a little basckground, he asked irately, ""And I was supposed to know this how?"" Exactly. Even I, devoted HP reader and movie watcher, had the sense that ""Order of the Phoenix"" was 128 minutes of previews for the REAL movie--which I'd love to see! Perhaps an unedited version will show up (on ten discs)...I'm giving it three stars instead of one, because of the stunning acting--especially Alan Rickman and Imelda Staunton--and the amazing sets.  It's unfortunate that both got such short shrift.And by the way, kudos to J.K. Rowling for not writing with an eye to the movies."	3.0	When will the REAL movie come out?	2007-07-23	8	6	2

During his summer stay with the rotten Aunt Petuna and Uncle Vernon (Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffths), he is out somewhere with his cousin Dudley (Harry Melling) until a death-eater attacks him as Harry uses magic to get rid of his as it is nearly gets him in trouble with the ministry for underaged wizardy in the real world. He does return back to the world of magic to Hogwarts, Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) is back as he gives Harry some warnings that could lead him to certain dangers ahead. A new teacher named Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Stauton) seems to be in charge of some of the students making them be almost like if it was the army, Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) with Harry, Hermonine (Emma Watson), Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) and Ron (Rupert Grin) with other students secretly vow to go against what the ministry and even go into war preparation.Co-starring Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Robbie Coltrane, Helen Bonna Carter, Maggie Smith, Tom Felton, Robert Hardy, Warwick Davis with the original cast of Hogwarts from the other movies and with cameo by Robert Pattison. This is more about learning about friendship, sacrifice and about the power of freedom as those are the major themes of this installment even being a bit about getting pressure due to the system as you can crush it. Here you get to meet more interesting creatures like the goofy if lovable giant known as Grawpy and more with more improved special effects that doesn't overdo the brilliant storytelling. Sure there are some cuts and changes from the book but no adaptation of a movie is perfect, it's just a great installment i recommend and is the smartest movie of the series.This Blu-Ray gives you flawless perfect HD picture and surround sound like if you saw it in the theater.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A24RT6AVJXJZHF	"John P. Thiel ""John P. Thiel"""	This is a serious film, and that being the case they could have upped the dramatic element of it but you have to remember that this is--at it's root--a film for kids.  Still, that doesn't mean they hold back on spectactular acting.The parts of Umbridge and Voldemort were played so well that any fan of great acting should not miss this film.With respect to Voldemort, his physical play of the role is spectacular, the way he taunts, tortures, and relishes in the torment of his victims--like he's bursting with joy with each shriek of horror.Umbridge is also one who meticulously has played her part as sweet to the point of bitterness, defiling the world with a fresh coat of pink paint, a gallon too much of perfume, about five layers over made up, and with no moral conscience as she makes daily life a seething hell of unjust rules and punishments.Both are utterly convincing.I suppose if the movie lacks anything, it's a good bit of comic relief.  The Weasley Twins provide proper mischief as their farewell to academia, but perhaps they could have added something--since they took such liberties with all the other books with negative effect--to make, say, the scene where Umbridge is lead into the woods to be taken away by its residents a bit more of a laugh.  As it was, such scenes that should have been humorous were just cogs in the story.Setting and scenery are the best yet in this film.  Everything seems real, nothing contrived, every act of magic made so that it doesn't appear the least bit cartoonish or 'Disney.'BOTTOM LINE: An excellent film.  Even if you have no mind to see any of the Harry Potter films or read any of the books, this is a great film to see on it's own.  Simply, great filmmaking with excellent acting throughout.	5.0	The days of cute magic are gone.	2007-08-27	6	5	1

This book should never have been compressed into a two hour film.  It is simply cut way too short.  Although the storyline was great, if Ihadn't read the book, I might not even know what is going on.  The pace is choppy and too fast.2.  Dolores Jane Umbridge was as good as you could have hoped for.  But again, the film cut things too short.  There was hardly any time to get the gist of her character or appreciate what is going on.  Alot of good parts of the book are left out altogether.3.  Ron hardly said anything.  It seemed to me like he didn't even want to be in the film this time.4.  Alas, the first Dumbledore was just plain better.  I say this not because Dumbledore 2 is a bad actor.  Just that the very character of Dumbledore doesn't fit guy #2.  Dumbledore was always calm, smiling, courteous.....in control, no matter how tough the situation.  The new guy is a firecracker- tempermental, worried, quick to anger.  It just misses the charm that the Dumbledore character had, and what made him an extraordinary person.5.  Great special effects as usual.6.  There is some kind of tension among the ""kids"".  They just don't seem relaxed around each other.  You would think by Book 5 they would all be pals by now..........not sure what is going on there.------------------------------------------I say, see the film, but by all means, read the book or get it on CD.  It is a much better story!----------BTW- I thought some of the deleted scenes were like..... necessary!  Whodecreed that all movies have to be under 120 minutes anyway?Thank god they didn't do this kind of choppery to LOTR.  That would have been most distressing.  Peter Jackson, listen up, ya 'hear?

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2Y3CWITEF9JGY	"JP Salazar ""Web Developer"""	"There is always a ""black sheep"" to every movie franchise. We've seen many examples in recent times. Unfortunately, even successful ones like Harry Potter are not immune to this sequel ""curse."" Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is probably the dullest of the series. What happened to the Magic? Where is the charm and sense of adventure of previous installments? It is inexcusably long with very little magical moments, but plenty of dialogue and full of political themes. The whole thing feels tiresome, forced, and distant. I'm sorry if I say this, but Harry Potter movies are played out.Brief Story Intro:Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) gets in deep trouble with the Ministry of Magic for underage magic--he had to use his powers because two Dementors came out of nowhere and attacked him and his cousin. Fortunately Harry is not alone for this trial, professor Mad-Eye (Brendan Gleeson) along with many friends take him to Sirius`s home which is also the headquarters for the Order of the Phoenix--a secret organization who is getting ready for a war against Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). They know they have to be prepared. The day of the trial, Harry is exonerated with the help of Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) and her charismatic neighbor who saw part of what happened. But Harry has bigger problems than this.There is a sense of paranoia and uncertainty in the wizard community. The Ministry of Magic led by Cornelius Fudge strongly denies the return of Voldemort and does everything to neutralize anyone who believes in it--apparently they operate like a socialist government. He even appoints the evil Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) to be a member of Hogwarts' staff, so she can easily spy on the students. She uses her influences to ban all use of magic. Meanwhile Harry and his friends are getting ready to fight Voldemort's army--by secretly practicing their magic--but he feels that there is an evil connection between him and the Dark Lord. Will he be able to face Voldemort one more time?Review:Unfortunately there are things that simply do not work this time around. The magical discoveries, the lovely friendship and the adventures are almost nonexistent. All replaced with political issues, hateful new characters, few special effects and an insecure Potter.Some might argue saying things like the franchise is maturing to a higher level. It is an excuse and I must disagree. Of course the series can evolve, but it doesn't mean that it has to ""sacrifice"" the very reason the audience--especially the fans--come to see these films. Just to be entertained by watching Potter's adventures. The story is right on the money though--it is an interesting chapter indeed--but the way it is presented is where the problem begins. Phoenix is just a tiresome affair. It is long, slow-paced, soapy and draggy. Even some of the actors look tired of playing their roles, including Daniel Radcliffe whose character is very insecure and mostly angry throughout the film.Frustrating are those moments where I desperately wanted something exciting or ""cool"" to happen. Sadly those moments are few and far between. Let's talk about the ""training"" scenes where Harry and company are preparing to go to war with Voldemort. Director David Yates, who has done mostly TV movies, misses a great opportunity here. Instead of providing an exciting display of magic acts, he--somehow--manages to create the dullest moment of the series (I've seen every film). How are we supposed to get excited about a bunch of teenagers playing with their magic wands? The ""rebellion"" scene against Dolores Umbridge is another letdown of the film. It feels forced and has the Pink Floyd the Wall flavor to it.Not everything is lost in Phoenix. There are some good moments of tension between Dolores (probably the most hated character of the franchise) and Harry. Also the giant--who strikingly resembles Alfred from Mad Magazine--shows up and gives us some charming moments. But one of the best highlights of the film is the final battle. It is pretty dynamic, dramatic and the graphics are decent. I personally like the Potter-""Exorcist"" approach.The Verdict:Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix stays in first gear until the end--it never recovers from its slow beginning. The exciting magical moments are long gone, replaced with political themes, draggy moments, annoying characters and sad new surprises."	3.0	All previous films got 5 stars...why 3 now?	2007-11-21	7	4	3

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A164D2I3CT3LLF	J. Silberman	While Goblet of Fire was a coming of age film, OOTP is the first adult film of the Harry Potter series. The three kids are now teens forced to grow up quickly as has always been true in times of war. Given the ending of the last film with the death of Cedric, this film is necessarily dark. Harry and his friends are now playing for keeps in an adult world. The growing complexity of Rowling's plot line is making each film much more challenging than its predecessor. Film can never satisfy in the same way as a book because the decisions regarding imagery are left to the reader, while it is the director who decides for his audience. No film can capture in less than two hours the content of a 700 plus page book. Nevertheless, OOTP was satisfying and on a second viewing, I reconciled myself to the frequent jump cuts which David Yates employed to squeeze in as much content as possible. Potter fans will enjoy OOTP, but those who have not read the books may find the film not much more than eye candy. Yates did a serviceable job, but of all the directors who have been associated with a Potter film, my favorite was Alfonso Curion, director of Prisoner of Azkaban. That film flowed seamlessly; beautifully integrating the complexities of plot line and character development. His directorial style grasped the intrinsic charm of the Potter fantasy. Curion's flair for fantasy was even more famously demonstrated in the oscar nominated Pan's Labyrinth released last year. I know that David Yates has already been selected to do the next film, The Half Blood Prince,  but perhaps Curion could be hired to do the Deathly Hallows, which will naturally be the most important one of the lot.	3.0	OOTP Is The First Adult Film of the HP Series	2007-08-19	5	3	2

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A10G4BPT5MGBHY	Julie Neal	I have mixed feelings about this film. On one hand, it's certainly well crafted, and as a dark melodrama it's a lean, mean moody machine. But on the other hand, it's so empty.Remember the delight you felt watching the earlier films? It's gone! There's no joy in this one, and without it the fact that nothing much happens to advance the plot makes the whole thing kind of a drag. In the other movies I especially liked the charisma of Hermione and Ron, and in this film I don't know if either of them smiled once. Even Harry's first kiss has had the fun sucked out of it. Perhaps that's all inevitable, as of course everything here is based on the book. But in this case the 800-page novel didn't become the 2-hour movie without losing much of its appeal.That said, of course I bought it! I'm a huge fan of this series, and know the characters so well that even these mediocre moments are still entertaining to watch. But if I wasn't familiar with the series and the characters, this movie would hold little appeal for me. It can't stand on its own.	4.0	Lots of drama, not much magic	2007-11-22	17	12	5
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A28OWZDW0B1GRH	Julien Walden	I read Order of the Phoenix after seeing the film, and I'm glad I did it that way.  While it's a very good book, as the others are, it is also rather frustrating.  If anything, Rowling represents the Ministry's interference with Hogwarts in the person of Dolores Umbridge all too well, and it goes on for hundreds of aggrivating pages, almost becoming as oppressive to the readers as it is to the students.  If it was Rowling's intention to create in her huge audience a deep hatred for the arbitrary and often destructive power of corrupt, willfully ignorant authorities, she has surely accomplished that mission here- and it's an all too timely lesson no one can afford not to learn!  But in the novel, it does get to be a bit much after five hundred pages or so.  Having seen the film both before and after reading the book, I am glad for the streamlining of the story that the film offers; all the essential elements are there- did we really need another Quiddich match, or any other distractions from the main story when that story is the key to everything that will follow?  I think this was, in some ways, the best of the films.  It didn't lack for drama at any point, and it set up what is to come quite effectively.  Of course, the end of the book explains things more thoroughly- and a bit more clearly- but by the time you get there, you are quite exhausted.  If they had tried to film all of what is going on in the book, or even most of it, side-stories and all, in the process making this the longest film as well as the longest book, it wouldn't have worked half as well as it did.  The most important element of book 5 is the beginning of the second war and all that it involves, and it was this that David Yates emphasised- from the Ministry's panic-based oppression to the desperate preparation of the Order and the haphazard training of Dumbledore's Army.  There is just enough of Dolores Umbridge here to make Rowling's point without getting tiresome, and the inessential-to the film, at least- elements that Yates stripped away are really no great loss, as it is the battle in the Ministry that is really the heart of this film, anyway.  It is in that climactic sequence- which I saw in amazing IMAX 3-D- that the key to the future lies.  Can Voldemort be defeated?  How?  Those of us who've read the books must keep quiet; we must not spoil it for those who are merely following the films. . .At any rate, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is an excellent example of the difference between the two mediums, novel and film.  What works in a novel rarely does on a screen, or at least doesn't work the same way (one of the only exceptions to this rule that I've ever seen is Rosemary's Baby, where Polanski follows Ira Levin's novel almost religiously, to brilliant effect).  J.K. Rowling's 870-page novel is way too much for the movies; only a skilled filmmaker could've cut it down to it's essential story, retaining enough details and character development to make it work on screen.  Did it work?  I believe so, and the box-office tally seems to agree with me.  The important new characters were introduced and developed effectively, and the old ones matured and changed; the story was told well, with clarity and suspense.  Can't wait to see it again on DVD.	5.0	Cutting novels for filming not always a bad thing. . .	2007-10-29	8	6	2

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2X7NBUETXC19E	Justin G.	My expectations were quite high for the film adaptation ofHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5), especially given the previous Harry Potter films extraordinarily high quality, so this movie had a lot to live up to. How did it measure up? Read on...Adaptation - Adapting a nearly 900 page novel for film has to be a daunting task. There is just too much going on in the novel to fit cleanly into a 2+ hour movie, so of course there are some omissions that will no doubt infuriate some Harry Potter fanatics. The main events are all there, but they've all been modified somewhat to cover for the elements that are missing. This is the first time I've felt that the story was changed significantly for the film adaptation, and while it may not be noticeable to those who haven't read the book, for the rest of us it seems a bit like the Reader's Digest version of Order of the Phoenix.Acting - The acting in this film is first rate as always. Daniel Radcliffe seems surer of himself this time around, and while Rupert Grint and Emma Watson don't have as prominent a role this time around, they still give admirable performances. All of the regulars are great, but they're completely overshadowed by a pair of newcomers, Imelda Staunton as the delightfully devilish Professor Umbridge and Evanna Lynch's completely charming Luna Lovegood.Direction - David Yates does a great job in his initial foray into the world of Harry Potter. The fast pace keeps viewers engaged (blink and you'll miss something) while constantly moving forward to the confrontation we all know is coming. In keeping with both the book and the previous films, Order of the Phoenix is a very dark movie. It gives the impression that things can only get worse from here.Everything Else - There were a lot of highlights to this movie. The Dumbledore's Army scenes were fantastic, as were the flights over London. The Thestrals are far and away the best creatures used in the films. The chemistry between Harry and Luna was so intense that if you didn't know better you'd swear they were setting up a romantic storyline for those two. Ginny Weasley may not have said much, but her sideline glances, particularly towards Harry and Cho, spoke volumes. And of course there is the final battle at the Ministry of Magic. I've visualized it in my head so many times that no movie could ever completely satisfy, but it sure came close. The constant smoky apparations were a bit distracting, and I'd have preferred to see more one-on-one attention to the Death Eater/Dumbledore's Army/Order of the Phoenix battles, but as a whole I thought it was as good as any recent Star Wars lightsaber battle, particularly the showdown between Dumbledore and Voldemort. That was one seriously intense encounter!DVD Extras - The 2-disc version of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix offers up the typical array of unused scenes, documentary footage, etc. I was hoping for more in terms of deleted scenes (say another 2 hours or so!), but I guess that was wishful thinking. The most promising extra feature ended up being the most frustrating. A flyer inside the box offers a free digital version of the film that you can store on your computer or portable device - but the small print goes on to inform you that if you have a Mac or an iPod this feature will not work. What a way to take a great bonus feature and exclude nearly all of the people who would be likely to benefit from it!That frustration aside, I was quite pleased with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. It seemed a bit rushed at times, and serious disciples of the novels may be a bit distracted noting all of the differences between the book and the movie, but as a whole I think the movie works quite well, and is a worthy addition to the Harry Potter DVD library.	4.0	Great movie, but not for your iPod!	2007-07-12	4	4	0

For instance, despite being one of the longer books, the Order of the Phoenix movie was shorter than other Potter movies in my recall, and I saw no excuse for that. Rowling injects a lot of detail and humor in her books, and I didn't see this reflected in the Order of the Phoenix movie nearly as faithfully as, say, The Philosopher's (Sorcerer's) Stone movie told the story of the first book.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A27P0MW8TE1JQP	Kevin J. Loria	"Better pacing than the novel ""Order"" trims the story while keeping the spirit of the text. Like the text the franchise is progressively darker, set in an almost post-911 world, following the disturbing events of the Goblet of Fire. Everything's changed... But not the superb casting with more Oscar Winners than you can shake a wand at, Oldman delivers again as Harry's Godfather Sirius Black aka Padfoot (the nickname is actually referenced in this one). Of course, this one has a climatic full scale battle of wands (the largest yet ) and Michael Gambon successfully dispenses Dumbledore's final duel with the Dark Lord a.k.a Tom. If you have the chance to see this in IMAX, by all means do so, oh yes!The story...Before Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) can even start their fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is attacked by Dementors, then placed on trail for underage magic  in front of a muggle. He isn't the only one under fire from a Minstry of Magic in denial, so is Hogwarts itself, when loathsome Dolores Umbridge, new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, played by Oscar winning actress Imelda Staunton, appears to oppress the place.  Failing to be taught actual defensive magic Harry and crew form a secret class of their own, but the newly revived Voldemort, again played by Ralph Fiennes, along with a face-full of Death Eaters including Bellatrix Lestrange played by Helena Bonham Carter (who I had in mind when I first read the book) and Lucius Malfoy (still Jason Isaacs), are plotting something nasty.Harry's rage and isolation is effectively portrayed, as is his edited relationship with Cho. Some of the novel's best lines remain intact here, like Ron and Hermione's assessment of Harry's kissing. Fred and George's exit from Hogwarts isn't altered enough to lose it's punch, neither is the film's exploration of teen rebellion and the consequences of becoming adults. Some of the films real heart comes from not only the brief moments between Harry and his godfather (Sirius gives volumes of exposition when refers to Harry as James during the climax), but moments between Harry and quirky Luna Lovegood, as they reflect on life, death and nargles.The effects are brilliant even though the CGI centaurs return, but thankfully do not speak or leave the shadows (see Sorcerer's Stone, yikes!), the other magical creatures look good, house-elves and horses alike. But ....the the wand battle will likely set a new standard for magic in film!"	5.0	Wands out! He's back!	2007-07-12	5	4	1
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A30TK6U7DNS82R	Kevin Killian	"We saw this in the 3-D Imax version so don't expect me to remember much about the ending, for the lasr 20 minutes produced nothing but gasps of terror and frowns of puzzlement from our row, since the editing is so rapidfire we couldn't really tell what was happening.  I know they went to the Ministry, and that's about it!  I wish I had seen it the regular way without the 3-D glasses, then I might have been able to understand it better.  We take along Mark, an expert at Harry Potter, every time we go to one of these shows, and we are the irritating ones in the row ahead of yours who are always turning to the expert and asking, ""Now who is that tall girl with the red hair?  Was she in the movie before?""The plot is so complicated now that ordinary notions of character development must have been the first thing the screenwriters chucked out.  We know Harry is angry, angry, angry all the time, for not only is he in a funk through most of the movie but he even has a scene where he says, ""I'm angry, angry all the time!""  Everyone's trying to help, but Harry just can't see that.  He's still traumatized, I think, by witnessing the death of Cedric Diggory in the previous movie.  Pity in a way Cedric didn't stick around for book 5, isn't it, because he might have raised the beauty quotient a little.  The producers must be fairly sick the way that they bet on a whole crew of child actors and now they have to watch them turn into awkward, plain galoofs of teens, barring Emma Watson, Dan Radcliffe and one or two others (like that tall girl with the red hair).  If Emma Watson loses one more ounce however, she is going to be able to squeeze through the eye of a needle no matter how much money she has.  Rupert Grint?  Well, there may be some who find him attractive, though director David Yates seems to be averting the camera every time it pans in Grint's direction--cut!OK, so now can somebody tell me what was so great about that prophecy?  I could have told you what it said and I've never read a Potter book in my life.  Couldn't it have been something a little bit more gripping?  THAT'S the McGuffin of the whole movie?  No, no, no, I must have missed something while in my 3-D meltdown.  Tell me that little ball thing said something interesting!"	5.0	The Famous Five	2007-08-24	9	2	7
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AJF4AYE14M5P0	Kevin Ryan	Let me start out this review by honestly declaring that I am not a Harry Potter fanatic. They were fun books to read through and I did enjoy them. However, I've only read through the series once and that was that. I am looking forward to the final book in the series but I really didn't have much hype for the fifth Harry Potter movie coming out, especially since The Goblet of Fire was disappointingly terrible. Despite my hesitations, I went to see Order of the Phoenix today by myself in a fairly empty theater in my own row - front and center. I did not remember much from the book and so I was able to see the movie as a movie and not be worried about what was cut, added, edited, or changed from the book. That being said, I have a few words to describe how I felt about Order of the Phoenix as the credits began to scroll across the screen.Outstanding. Brilliant. Inspiring.This movie has completely transcended its franchise from being just another Harry Potter film to being a complex, emotional, gripping, and masterful work of cinema. This is a movie that reminds me why I love movies and why I want to write music for them. There were so many scenes that gave me chills because they were so amazing to watch and so very emotionally gripping. Now that I think of it, I can't think of another movie that gave me so many chills excluding, perhaps, the Lord of the Rings trilogy. But this movie is not like Lord of the Rings - it isn't an epic work of fantasy. Harry Potter is about the characters and this installment, in my opinion, finally utilizes that which makes the books so enchanting - the characters in it. What a plethora of characters we get to see in this movie! Professor Trelawny, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Alastor Moody, Bellatrix Lestrange, Luna Lovegood... I could go on and on. It was so great to see so many familiar faces along with the new characters introduced in Order of the Phoenix. Of course the main characters are all present as well, but there was something particularly refreshing about them in this film, as if director David Yates has breathed new life into them. The acting was really extraordinary and while I am no expert, I believed in the characters more than I ever have before. I personally loved (pardon the pun) Luna Lovegood. She was hilarious, touching, heroic and so fun to watch. What a great addition to the cast. Also, I finally liked Michael Gambon as Dumbledore in this movie - he completely rejuvenated his character.Harry's character really comes of age in Order of the Phoenix. He is not a little boy learning magic anymore, and we really can see that in this film. He steps up and takes charge, he really cares about his friendships, and he is learning to deal with the complex emotions regarding the death of his parents and his connection to Lord Voldemort. I really felt for Harry in this film - I truly wanted the best for him and his friends, as if I knew them. Ron and Hermione complete the friendship triangle and this movie shows us how close and meaningful their friendship has become. It really is a wonder what Yates has done to the characters in this franchise.Something that I really enjoyed about Order of the Phoenix was the high level of realism. I felt like Harry Potter's world wasn't some made up story, but that there really could be a Hogwarts School in England right now as I write this. The opening scenes with Harry and Dudley were not a silly and comical introduction, but instead reminded me that Harry was living in the real world with real problems. Sure Harry lives and learns among magic wielding folk, but he is doing so in an ordinary world just like ours and I think that is such a fun concept.The film score by Nicholas Hooper is especially noteworthy. The music was  great and so perfectly adapted to the film. The highly rhythmic and bouncy melody that became the leitmotif for this film was an outstanding addition. I also liked how the composer really brought an English feel to the music which made the viewer feel like they were right there in the English countryside. I just adored the music in Order of the Phoenix.The climax of the movie is the battles between the Order of the Phoenix and the Deatheaters and then between Dumbledore and Voldemort. While I won't give away any details, let me tell you that it left me breathless. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, completely engrossed in what was going on. There is no disappointment here.I really could go on and on about this movie. Hogwarts looked great, I loved the camera work, the script was fantastic, the scenery was beautiful, the music was superb and the acting top notch. Really, what more could you ask for in a movie? I did not like Order of the Phoenix just because it was a Harry Potter movie. I liked it because it stands on its own as a fantastic movie. This film delivers in every way a movie can and I want, no, I need to see it again - several times.Kevin's Review: A+	5.0	An Outstanding Movie	2007-07-11	4	4	0
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"No one who has stated that this film feels like a ""Cliff's Notes"" version of the wonderful J.K. Rowling novel, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is wrong.  They are 100% correct.  With that said, however, I must admit that I still enjoyed this film.  For fans of the books (like myself), this film could be very brutal at times, eliminating the bulk of the tale in order to swiftly move to the primary story.  In essence, this film paid lipservice to most of the parts of the book that didn't deal directly with Harry.As a film, this movie is enjoyable.  It moves at a very swift pace and never gets too boring.  The action scenes are well done and the acting is, as a whole, very good.  The music was also very good, although it isn't too hard to emote ""dark and gloomy"" when it's all over a film.  The special effects were, as expected, brilliant.  It was nice to see the Dursleys back on the screen, no matter how brief their moment was.It's nowhere near five-star quality, but it does progress the film series along fairly well.  I have a few gripes that I believe need to be addressed.  Firstly, the film seems to be lacking heart, which was central to all of the previous films.  As highly developed as these characters were through the other movies, this one seemed to detach the viewer from the players on the screen.  Another problem is that key moments that were included were often treated lightly or in a careless fashion.  There are also a few editing choices that give the film a disjointed feel.  My biggest gripe was the treatment of some of the new characters like Tonks, Luna Lovegood, and Bellatrix Lestrange.  These are three of the most imaginative characters that Rowling put on paper and of them only Luna gets decent screentime.  Tonks, played by the lovely Natalia Tena, pops up, says a few lines, winks at Harry, and then makes a few funny faces before being brushed by the wayside.  Helena Bonham Carter was perfectly cast as the wicked Bellatrix, but she snarls at the camera, does the ""deed"" she's expected to do in the film, and the sings her way off into the sunset.  I completely understand that the director and screenwriter were trying to compound a very big book into a reasonable running time, but I felt as if they just tossed a coin to decide what stayed and what had to go.Could the movie have been better, yes, but it's still not as bad as a lot of films out there.  Like I stated before, a lot of the story was cut from the book to give this film a reasonable time limit.  I just feel as if the parts that were excluded were done so rather carelessly.  Compared to the other Potter films, it's a three star movie.  Compared to other fantasy flicks that have come out lately, it's three-and-a-half stars.If you're a Potter fan, buy it and enjoy it for what it does have in it.  Otherwise I'd just keep it as a rental."	3.0	Abbreviations Abound, But Potter's Still Pretty Good	2007-12-20	3	2	1

I thought this movie was brilliantly done. I'm getting really tired of people complaining about the minor things that were wrong with this movie. I read another review where someone gave it 1 star because ""kreacher's nose wasn't ....."" I forgot what he/she said. Are you serious?! You're gonna judge the movie because the house elf's nose was different than described in the book? I think people forget that this book was nearly 1,000 pages long. They HAD to leave stuff out of the movie. If they tried to cram it all in the movie, it would be a 6 hour movie! Yes Cho's friend was the one who ratted out the DA in the book not Cho, WHO CARES! I think they did a great job making the movie given the fact that the book was so long.

I regret that the ""Inquisitorial Squad"" didn't get more time in the theatre edition of the film.  Sadly, ""SPEW"" was absent from the film.

My favorite of the Harry Potter movies so far is the Prisoner of Azkaban and this one. I know this is where alot of parents and younger audiences think the movies get worse and worse. I disagree. I do think they are leaving too much out of the movies but that is mostly credited to the changing of the directors and writers of the movies, the movies themselves still have incredible effects, storyline and acting. Alot of parents also don't like how the ratings in the movies are now PG-13 and are darker, people need to crack open those Harry Potter books again, these books are dark and I was happy to have movies 3-5 show what the books convey. The kids are growing up in the books, you can't expect PG ratings when the books become about teenagers and growing up. I've gone off in all directions, but bottom line I loved this movie and I can not wait for the 6th one, btw I wish someone would anti-up the Ginny jealousy in this movie.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1LC7BJPPHN1IE	Kristin M.	"*SPOILER ALERT*  A quick summary:*SPOILER ALERT*.  In GOF,Lord Voldemort wonderfully kills Robert Pattinson, sorry, Cedric Diggory and everyone thinks Harry killed him. In Order of the Phoenix, Harry meets the Order of the Phoenix, a secret club that protects the world from Lord Voldemort.  Hogwarts' new DADA teacher (Umbridge), refuses to let the students learn defense magic.  So, Harry, Ron, Hermione and the other students make a club of their own, Dumbledore's Army.  Harry get's his first kiss, get's posessed by Voldemort and all hell breaks lose.  Harry and Dumbledore's Army fly to the Ministry of Magic and Voldemort and Dumbledore get into a huge battle with water and fire, and Dumbledore wins for now.  The end!  Mind you, this is a short summary just to give you an idea on what the movie is about.  Also, there are a couple cute Ron and Hermione moments in this movie-for us shippers.The biggest complaints about the ""Harry Potter Ultimate Edition"" DVDs are that the movies are not shown in full.  You're just watching the theater version without all of the deleted scenes and such.  The reason all fans should buy this DVD is not because of the actual movie, because let's face it, fans have seen the movies probably well over 50 times each...  The reason to get this DVD is because of the bonus features, and of course, because it's a collectors item.I buy them because they feature tons of bonus stuff.  You get these oversized character cards, you get a little booklet that shows the concept art, you get this documentary that they filmed about the world of Harry Potter-they cut it into, I think, 5 or 7 parts and you get each part of the documentary with each movie.  I love the HP movies with a passion, and ever since David Yates signed on to direct Order of the Phoenix, I re-fell in love with the Hary Potter movies.  David Yates directs the movies so well, and he really has made the final 4 Harry Potter movies what they should be-EPIC!Another reason to own this movie is to see how Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have grown up into wonderful actors.  Personally, I think in this movie, they really show off their acting chops and show everyone that they're serious actors, and damn good ones, too.  They weren't that bad in HP 1-4, but in this movie, they hit the nail on the head.  They've really gotten comfortable with their characters and portray them so well.Fans of Harry Potter and non-fans should buy this, even if just to own it.  This recent generation of kids growing up into teens, then young adults is going to forever be known as the Harry Potter Generation.  The books have sold over 400 million copies (and counting) and the Harry Potter franchise is the highest grossing film franchise in movie history and have given us 3 extremely talented young actors.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3LF914GG87TWP	"K. Sozaeva ""Obsessive bibliophile"""	"While a good bit of the story does get whittled out in order to pare the story down enough to fit to movie length, the screen-play writer and director have managed to maintain overall the integrity of the story.After witnessing Cedric Diggory's murder by Voldemort, and just barely escaping himself, Harry is understandably a bit traumatized.  When he and his cousin Dudley are attacked by Dementors, Harry has to use a Patronus charm.  This leads to receipt of a letter announcing that he has been expelled from Hogwart's.  Understandably upset, Harry is surprised that night to receive a visit from several old friends, including Mad-Eye Moody and Tonks, who have come to ""rescue"" him from the ""loving"" arms of his relatives, and take him to the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, where Harry learns that the reason he hasn't heard from anyone all summer is because they have been trying to protect him from learning about how the Ministry of Magic and the magical press are attacking him, and claiming that Harry is wrong, Voldemort is not back, and all of this is just a ploy by Dumbledore to take over the Ministry.  After a trial that was an obvious set-up for Harry to lose - which was thwarted by the timely arrival of both Dumbledore and Mrs. Figg, a squibb who lives near Harry's relatives - Harry finally gets back to Hogwarts, only to find many of his former friends are regarding him with suspicion, if not outright disdain.Enter Dolores Umbridge - with her pink clothing, pink office furniture, pink china - I mean, sweet Goddess, even her SUGAR that she stirs into her pink tea is PINK!  While I was a bit disappointed that they chose to hire someone to play Umbridge who was much more attractive than she is described in the book, nonetheless this actress did a fabulous job of playing the ""smiling while I stab you"" evil vileness of Umbridge.  I especially loved the scene where she had practically everyone in detention, all writing with her ""special"" quills, while she sat upon a golden, throne-like chair, a smile of intense satisfaction upon her face.  It was beautiful.For those who want some wizarding, you won't be disappointed.  Dumbledore's Army provides a lot of wizarding action, as the students, under Harry's tutelage, learn to defend themselves with practical spells.  Also, in the final climactic scenes - especially the ones with Voldemore and Dumbledore - there are some truly wonderful special effects.  Also some very good acting from (at least my) favorite evil Death eater Bellatrix played by Helena Bonham Carter.  She does the joyfully evil persona perfectly.Let's not forget Grawp!  A lovely CGI brother for Hagrid, who sadly we don't get to see much of in this movie.  The Centaurs make a very brief appearance, and we only see them in fast action, so it is difficult to make much of a comment on their appearance, as I couldn't see them very well.Overall, I loved it.  It advanced the story nicely, it kept to the overall flavour of the series as well as the story of the book, and the acting was superb.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AZK9NAQHMNYNX	K.S. Puckett	It took awhile for me to really know how I felt about Order of the Phoenix. After several viewings and a couple of years, it's settled into being in my top two (for now). What stumbled me was what I felt were weird, abrupt transitions and rushing through some scenes (like Snape's memory). And though I liked the Dementor sequence at the beginning, I preferred their look in the third movie.This movie and Half-Blood Prince are pretty close for me, but the action pushes Order of the Phoenix a cut above on my list. A good battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore near the end and the D.A. meetings were highlights, and the significant toning down of loudly angry Harry from the book was greatly appreciated by me.	4.0	Despite Some Abruptness, I Like It	2010-09-29	0	0	0
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A39HI3CKVEXV1I	KTFaye	"Saw it in the theatre and now again on DVD and all in all, it's my least favorite of the Harry Potter films.  Steve Kloves did as good a job as anyone could of taking the densely plotted books and paring them down to filmable length.  Unfortunately, he didn't do the adaptation for this film.  However, whatever good work his successor may have turned out turned out was negated by some of the most ham-fisted editing choices I've ever seen on a film.  In fairness, this was a tough, tough book to adapt, but while I'm sure the effort was made, in the end, it's just not as good as the other adaptations.For example, viewers shouldn't notice editing; it shouldn't be so obvious that scenes and dialog have been severely cut for time.  But you notice ALL these things here.  Scenes just end abruptly, scenes clearly have huge chunks of dialog cut for time, the climactic battle sequence was a hatchet job with gaps big enough to throw a cat through.  Some of the cuts made no sense at all.  Honestly, in some parts it feels like the old days in school where the film would break and just be spliced back together. Yes, all films are cut for time, but not usually in such a heavy-handed manner.  It is possible to do it well.  For example, the shorter versions of Lord of the Rings are still coherent, they flow, they're not jarring.  OOTP just feels like the film was edited by a food processor.I'm concerned that the next film also features the same director/editor combination.  Granted, I understand that Steve Kloves has returned, but I'm not sure that he can overcome what  David Yates can do to it.On the upside, the acting is first class, Especially Daniel Radcliff whose timing has just gotten better and better as he's gotten older.  The visuals are amazing, and of course the general story can still be gleaned, if you've read the book.  Otherwise, it might be confusing to those who only see the films.  All in all, the cast really turn in a good show, that was brought to its knees by bad editing and direction choices.  It makes you wonder what the same performances in the hands of Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, Mike Newell would have been like.As others have mentioned,  the extras are not worth the extra money.  You got deleted scenes that just roll one right after the other with not intro or reason as to why they were deleted.  There's a mildly interesting behind the scenes tour lead by the actress who plays Tonks who apparently thinks she's in a episode of romper room.  But there's nothing really behind the scenes to see unless you think the food commissary is all that interesting.There's a story so far extra that features talking heads all of whom wrote books speculating on the real meaning of harry potter.  Of course now that we all KNOW the meaning of Harry Potter, so the entire extra is rendered pretty moot.  It can't be that they were unaware that the 7th book came out this summer can it??  What was the point?Oh, and amusingly, they devote on entire extra to the ""magic"" of editing - ironically presented by David Yates and his editor, both of whom are responsible for one of the worst editing jobs ever put to film.  you do get to edit your own scene, which is a bit entertaining and I'm sure your average 8 year old is better than Yates.  It would be my recommendation to skip the extras and buy the single disk."	3.0	Good Acting, Poor Direction, Terrible Editing	2007-12-28	6	6	0

The acting was well done, the movie kept moving and kept your attention, and the editing was well done.  I look forward to watching it often!Having said that, reviewing this as a movie based upon a book....sure, there's something lost in the translation.  But that happens with every adaptation out there, and I can't imagine how difficult it is to cram 800 pages of SHTUFF into 2 hours of planned theatre time.Staunton's portrayal of Umbridge is spot on, and our trio of heroes (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint) dealt with those wonderful teenage emotions and hormones wonderfully well. I even saw some ""I think s/he likes me..."" looks between Ron and Hermione.  Very nice ease in to the future.Bonham-Carter's Bellatrix LeStrange is one for the history books.  Part of me wonders if Rowling was thinking of HBC when she wrote the character, frankly.My biggest quibble with the movie as a whole is the loss of certain details (yes, details will be lost in a transition such as this, but certain ones should be kept).  It was hard to comprehend what was happening with Harry while he was lying on the floor after the battle, and the Department of Mysteries/Prophecy globe didn't carry much weight.  I rather thought of the Maltese Falcon in this regard in the movie, actually.Otherwise, as an HP lover...I'm well-pleased and am looking forward to the next installment."	4.0	Well done, even with the time costraint.	2007-12-12	3	3	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AZ78HT7H9DVJG	LARRY	"Being a Harry Potter fan, I liked this movie regardless what coulda/woulda/shoulda been.In this installment, Harry Potter faces doubts and suspicion from his peers as well as from the Ministry to his proclamation that Lord Voldemort is back.  To Harry's frustration, Dumbledore doesn't help alleviate those doubts and suspicion because he keeps evading Harry.  To keep a tight rein on Hogswarts, the Ministry has sent Delores Umbridge, the Senior Undersecretary, as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  However, she soon appoints herself as the High Inquisitor when she perceives things at Hogswarts as out of control and unnecessary.  Meanwhile, Voldemort and his army are getting stronger.Like other reviewers, I was surprised to learn that the largest book of the Harry Potter series has been reduced to the shortest movie of the series.  Both the Harry Potter books and movies are formulaic.  However, in this movie, some were deleted (like the quidditch game) and some were ""fast-forwarded"" (like the Christmas break from school & Kreacher).  Naturally, I was a bit disappointed.  However, I still enjoyed the movie very much even though I thought there was more dialogue than action.However, I just have 3 issues.  First, I enjoyed Umbridge in the book.  Her ""hem, hem"" has caused my friends and I to say that to each other, especially on AIM.  So, I was expecting that line to be the thing of this movie.  Instead, it was just replaced with some regular unoriginal coughs.  Other than that, Umbridge was just freakingly good.  Second, Gwarp looks more like the Jolly Green Giant than anything else.  Third, as the title says 'the order of the phoenix', there was hardly much on the order.Nonetheless, I liked it even though others felt it was so-so.  I do have to agree that there less action than the previous installment, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  I'm already surprised that there is a movie poster for the 6th installment.  So, I'm looking forward to that."	4.0	good but wished it was better	2007-07-23	3	2	1

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"I think that when you take the longest Harry Potter book and turn it into the shortest Harry Potter film, that a large number of complaints by fans as to what has been cut will be inevitable after they watch ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.""  Not that this means that the legions of fans will be bitterly disappointed by the film version, but rather that there will be regrets over not getting to see favorite scenes on the screen.  For example, Quidditch is completely out of the film, denying Ron of his best moments in the sun (start singing ""Weasley is our king"").  So do not be surprised when your mind keeps shifting to what has been cut and distracting you from time to time while watching this summer's latest blockbuster.When last we left our hero, Harry fell victim to a trap to bring back Lord Voldermort, which cost Cedric Diggory his life.  The Ministry of Magic wants things hushed up, but Dumbledore tells the students at Hogwarts that Diggory was murdered and Lord Voldermort murdered him.  As this fifth film opens Harry and his wicked cousin Dudley are attacked by Dementors.  Harry uses his wand to defend them and is summarily expelled from Hogwarts for using magic in front of a muggle.  The good news is that Harry gets reinstated, but the bad news is that the Ministry of Magic uses the opportunity to appoint Dolores Umbridge,  Senior Undersecretary at the Ministry, as the school's new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.  However, Umbridge teaches only the theory and not the practice because she insists Harry is a liar and there is nothing the students need to learn to defend themselves from.  Then things get progressively worse.""The Order of the Phoenix"" was the most maddening book to read, not because it was the longest, but because I detest Dolores Umbridge.  As far as I am concerned she makes Voldermort look good, because he knows he is evil, wicked, bad, mean and nasty inside, while Umbridge thinks the ends justify the means.  She is puritanical, sadistic and hypocritical.  If there were not going to be children reading this review I would tell you what I really think of her.  Suffice it to say, she makes me sick and I do not even take pleasure in loving to hate her, which is why my only requirement going into the film is that the Weasley Twins get their moment of glory when they become the disloyal opposition to the new order at Hogwarts.Daniel Radcliffe continues to have the tote the heavy load in these films as Harry, with Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley being reduced more and more often to reaction shots while Emma Watson's Hermione Granger remains the Mistress of Exposition in these films.  Alan Rickman as Snape remains pitch perfect casting and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black is also a joy to watch, but I discovered in this film that I really like Michael Gambon's performance as Dumbledore, mainly because he always plays up the character's intelligence and I find I prefer his interpretation to that of the late Richard Harris, forgive my heresy.  Imelda Staunton does not look as much like a toad as Umbridge does in the book, but she captures the character's detestability from start to finish.  We are always painfully aware how dangerous she is, whether she smiles or not.  Also, Evanna Lynch steals more scenes as Luna Lovegood than Katie Leung does as Cho Chang, and it is certainly interesting to see Neville (Matthew Lewis) towering over everybody, with Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) in the silent but strong role for the pivotal sextet.After seeing this film I raced home and got out my copy of thebookand starting cataloguing things that had been cut.  Such comparisons are, as I suggested up top, inevitable for anyone who has read the book.  At this point what I missed the most were some of the conversations between Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall and Umbridge where Minerva verbally flaws the Inquisitor.  The omission that I am focusing on the most is the whole bit about why Neville's family was a target of Voldermort (I agree with Harry: always say his name and thereby reduce its power), since that suggests implications for what will happen in thefinal book, which gets released in just ten more days.  I also would have liked to have seen an over reaction to Harry discovering his father bullied Snape at Hogwarts.  My favorite part ends up being the impressive wizard's duel between Voldermort and Dumbledore.  Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg does a good job of whittling down Rowling's book and director David Yates does a competent job, but fans will simply want more.  Also, we know what happens in the next book and all of the bad things that happen in this film cannot help but seem inconsequential in comparison.  Plus, fans will be distracted by mining this film for clues as to what will happen in the last book."	4.0	The longest Harry Potter book gets whittled down to the shortest Harry Potter film	2007-07-11	332	285	47
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2DHJZOSMNYTT8	"L. Barrell ""Literary Lady"""	This was a disappointing movie and least enjoyable in series so far.  If I had not read the books, would probably not have a clue as to what was going on.  However, this book is the darkest and probably the hardest to translate to the screen as there is so much information past and present that needs to be sorted out and can't imagine how this 5th book in the series could be done well.  Wish the last two were completed now, as this movie closes with such darkness and can't wait to see how the rest of the story is played out!  Nevertheless, all the actors, actually the entire cast has done a wonderful job.  People unfamiliar with the books may not see all the subtle twists and darkening atmosphere....a friend thought it was very violent and disturbing and failed to see beyond the action because so much had to be left out of the script that was in the original novel.	2.0	Harry Potter and Order of Phoenix-2disc	2008-01-07	1	0	1
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	ARIYG8Y591CA0	L. Chapin	No criticism intended in my review title, they obviously HAD to condense this book for filmmaking purposes.  Even J.K. Rowling is now admitting the book itself could have used cutting; the filmmaker here does a very decent job of concentrating on the necessary and pruning the rest.It might have been nice if a few things weren't changed - magically inept Dolores Umbridge bursting through the door/wall of the Room of Requirement seemed a little over-the-top, for example.  And why try to tag Cho Chang with revealing critical information about Dumbledore's Army and their meeting-place?  Even if she's subsequently let off by another invented element, a veritaserum interrogation.  A few key elements, such as the role of Kreacher, the connections of the Blacks with other wizarding families, and the golden locket found at the Black residence on Grimmauld St. were also missing, which could cause them problems in the next film...although given that most of those viewing these films have read the books, that may not be too much of a problem.All in all this is quite a good film. It features at least two fine new characters - Imelda Staunton's Dolores Umbridge, perhaps even more evil for resembling a nice, cloth coat-clad Republican lady from the Midwest, and the amazingly on-target portrayal of Luna Lovegood by newcomer Evanna Lynch.  Their work only adds to the many rich characterizations of Rowling's characters provided by other actors in the previous films and continued in this one.The action concludes with a terrific final duel between Dumbledore and He Who Must Not be Named, which shows how effectively the films have used special effects as well.  The depictions of the Ministry, the Department of Mysteries and its dark veil of death are all exceptionally well-done.I'd have to recommend this film highly.  Rowling has been very effective at using her influence to make certain that her books are well-filmed, and this film is no exception.	4.0	Harry Potter and Filming the Condensed Book	2007-08-06	3	3	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1BJWFK932ORD5	"Leigh Ellen Tanner ""lelle76"""	"*Attention:  Spoilers*I really did enjoy this movie, but it does annoy me whenever I think about all of the REALLY important scenes and plot lines that were left out (also evident in Prisoner of Askaban and Goblet of Fire).For example, I think there should have been much more emphasis on Draco Malfoy's growing involvement with the Death Eaters.  For those of us who have read the books, we know that Draco's role becomes steadily more menacing, from whiny crybaby/bully to someone who is now rejoicing in ""the Dark Lord's"" return and who actually threatens Harry's life after Lucius Malfoy is jailed.  Movie version has Draco, his friends, and Mr Filch playing more comic relief than anything else, which was frustrating to see.Then there is the matter of exactly how dark and depressing Hogwart's becomes as Dolores Umbridge and the Ministry gain more of a hold.  Dumbledore leaves temporarily, as in the book, but there is no mention of the completely unprovoked and brutal attacks on other members of the staff.The Occulmency scenes, while very well done/well acted, were portrayed as (in my opinion) a *very* brief and rather unimportant subplot.  Occulmency plays a crucial part in the book, as does the ""Worst Memory"" in the pensieve, which was slashed to bits for the movie.  There is also almost no mention of the bitter animosity between Prof Snape and Sirius Black, neither does the movie truly explore Harry's profound anger and grief after the death of his godfather.There's more, of course -- and yes, I realize that, for a book of 700-plus pages, some scenes must be cut, but honestly -- I would have been happy to sit through another hour in order to see more critical portions of the book brought to life on the screen.On the plus side, the acting is great, and there are some scenes that were extremely well done, almost breathtaking, to watch -- one of my favorites is at the very beginning, with the confrontation between Harry and his cousin Dudley, the ominous gathering clouds, and then the cutaway to both of them tearing frantically down a road in what looks like the middle of nowhere, hearing their heavy panting as they run.So... in summary, I recommend it.  But I also *strongly* recommend reading the books as well to fill in those pesky gaps the movies have a tendency to leave out."	4.0	Good movie, but some brutal slashing of the story as a whole	2007-12-10	3	3	0
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A383PPSVXNB0NB	Leigh Fitzpatrick	Sometimes you have wonderful movie experiences when you least expect them and that happened last night.  HP:OOTP, the movie, blew me away with its complexity and brilliant acting delivered in a tight, fast moving pace.  What a journey from the Christmas-y first movie (which I enjoyed).  It captured exactly the themes that Rowling laid out in the 5th book.  It is the best Harry Potter movie (with Prisoner of Azkaban a close second).And yes, I liked it better than the book.  My problem with book five was not so much with the length but with the editing and feeling like I'd read a lot of it before. I went back to the first book and it was tightly written and fun. The Order of the Phoenix was rough and bloated; it felt about two drafts away from being complete (Rowling hinted that was the case: she said she eventually ran out of time and energy at the end.).Whereas the book had a signifcant deja vu aspect (The Dursley's are still despicable, the Slytherins continue to snicker and make fun of the gang with Rowling continuing to use the same descriptors-how many times can Pansy Parkinson shriek before she loses her vocal chords?-- and Snape still unfair.  It also seems to have set certain rules in stone that I thought were open questions such as: Are all Slytherin's evil? That wasn't the original premise.) the movie felt fresh and advanced the story in ways that surpassed the book.What makes the movie so good is that it manages to put in play very quickly important themes such as the overall tension (using the heat wave and washed out colors), Harry's co-mingled anger and sadness, romance, the rocky state of Harry's friendship with Hermione and Ron which they overcome by film's end, the twisted psychological state of Dolores Umbridge (a true sadist), the fear and denial of the wizarding world (via swooping, swirling visions of newspaper headlines), and the growing bond between Harry and Sirius.  It's a credit to the director, the cinematographer and most especially the actors that they can convey these thoughts, emotions and themes so quickly.But what ultimately tipped this movie into the area of greatness is how it fearlessly explored the themes of good and evil so honestly--astonishing for a movie based on a children's book.  The scene between Sirius and Harry where Harry confesses the troubling evil tendencies and anger in himself and Sirius' response made me really feel for Harry instead of being irritated at him as I was reading the book.  And Harry's final triumph where he kicks Voldemort out of his mind by flashing on scenes of love and friendship--and even finds it in himself to express pity for his mortal enemy--well, I'll admit it brought a tear to my eye---it was that powerful.	5.0	Best of the HP movies.....and better than the book	2007-07-16	6	4	2
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A18HHKM6WGEF9D	"L. Erickson ""Mommy Mystic"""	As other reviewers have noted, by necessity a lot of book 5 is left out of this movie, in order to keep the length manageable, but I think that is OK. Just watch it as a movie in a movie series, not as a play-by-play of the book, and you will be able to appreciate it. The focus is on the most essential aspects of the story - the growing threat of Voldemort, the denial of the ministry and media to accept this, including their smearing of Potter and Dumbledore, the evolution of the Order of the Phoenix, the growing authoritarian repression at Hogwarts under Professor Umbridge, and Harry's struggles with Voldemort's increasing presence in his mind. That's  A LOT to cover, and the movie does it well.This is a dark movie - the death of Cedric at the end of book and movie 4 marks the turning point in this series. From this point forward it is an out-and-out battle between good and evil, and the darker mood - and look - of this film reflects that. There is a lot of tension, and a lot of repressed (and expressed) anger, in the form of Umbridge, and, of course, Harry. Everyone is struggling to come to terms with what is happening, and many are denying it. Harry's status as an outsider is cemented, and yet, he rediscovers the importance of love and friendship in the form of Dumbledore's Army. This is a lot of psychoological complexity, coupled with adolescent angst, and everyone manages to pull it off.The final climactic scene, in which Dumbledore helps Harry 'expel' Voldemort from his mind, is critical to understanding the themes of this entire series, and I think it is done justice here. That in and of itself is enough to make me love this movie. So my advice is to forgive what is not covered, and assess it according to what is really most important to the series - if everything had been put in, some of the subtler scenes that drive the psychological drama would have been more rushed. Choices were made, and it's all to the good in my view.	5.0	Alot is Left Out, But the Essentials Are Handled Beautifully	2012-01-23	1	1	0

As his powers are growing and the mystery surrounding his true purpose in life still evades us, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher proves to be much more than most can handle, disrupting Harry's already fragile state of mind in the process...Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure with strong elements of fantasy, not to mention some very witty humor.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, David Thewlis, Alan Rickman (!), Gary Oldman, Ralph Fiennes, and the rest of this EXTRAORDINARY cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt one that can be watched over and over again.The concept, the plot, the setting, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music, are all EXCELLENT!  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is guaranteed to provide a great deal of entertainment.  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.  In short, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection when it becomes available!	5.0	KEEP'EM COMIN'...	2007-08-21	9	8	1
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A341VYUW684OFY	"L. Gordon ""voracious reader, cat lover, grate..."	Year 5 finds Harry  angrier than ever after his attempts to warn everyone of Lord Voldemort's return are met with disbelief and distain. Daniel Radcliffe once again portrays the stallwart young wizard with style and panache as an authoritarian bureaucrat slowly seizes power at Hogwarts. Although darker in tone than the previous films, there is much to enjoy with all three leads having grown into their characters and putting in above average performances. Understandably, Harry has a more commanding role as he becomes a leader setting out to ready his classmates for the inevitable battle. Although this film retains much of the enchantment of the earlier films, Harry's innocence and joy are noticeably absent.	5.0	Harry Potter - leaving the innocence behind	2008-01-14	0	0	0

Harry is a suitably stroppy teenager, in fact really stroppy, and the whole plot seems to be fairly ""woe is me""-esque. The students sit their OWL exams and learn amazing magic under Harry's tutelage. Draco's dad asks what everyone watching must have thought: ""Did u really think that children could win?"" There is finally some real action and magic towards the end of the movie; but the dramas and emotions that the written version impart are probably replaced with a happy/feel good message. My honestest opinion is that they tried to put too much plot in thsi film and it lost some continuity. It felt rushed and over-busy."	3.0	Too much plot	2011-08-01	2	1	1

Just a 411 for all you Harry Potter fans I read a book this summer by a new writer Ana Rose. She wrote a book called  Alfheim The Horn of Night Starr. It is a very good book I think she could be America's J.k Rollings with her Alfheim series. I read the book and it sucked me in from the begining, I couldn't put it down until I finished the final page! I would say her story is like Erogon meets Narina with a LOTR flavor to it. I really hope you check out this book it is one of the best reads I haad all summer! I can't wait for book 2.  You should look her up and give her book a read!

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2G9DGP3L4JGV1	L O'connor	It's a shock for Harry and his friends when Professor Dumbledore is replaced by the obnoxious Professor Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) and the teaching of real magic becomes taboo.  Harry forms his own secret organisation for teaching the forbidden Defense Against the Dark Arts, while outside Hogwarts his adult friends are trying to combat the increasing power of Lord Voldemort and his followers.The book has been severely abridged in order to fit it into feature-film length, but is none the worse for that, I thought the book was far too long in the first place.  There is a great performance from Helena Bonham Carter as the batty Bellatrix Lestrange, but the highlight of the film is undobutedly the convincingly creepy and repulsive peformance of Imelda Staunton as Professor Umbridge.The film carries an important message about the dangers of wrapping children up in cotton wool and not letting them do anything that is the slightest bit risky.  We all need to learn to defend ourselves against the Dark Arts, and children cannot begin too young to learn that the world is not always a totally safe place, and that life invariably involves encounters with danger.	4.0	Forbidden magic	2007-11-26	2	2	0

As you know, Warner Brothers has officially announced the Ultimate Editions of years 5 and 6. The product descriptions are quite wordy. There's a lot of talk about how fans should be excited about these new releases. But there are two words missing from the descriptions of both these products: Extended. Cut.These are the words that sold me in the beginning. The promise of seeing extended cuts of the HP films was enough for me (and many, MANY other fans) to double dip and get the Ultimate SS and CoS Blu-rays. And you know what? There were worth it. Not because of the endless array of worthless swag packed into over-size boxes. I mean, seriously... Anybody out there framing their lenticular cards and hanging them over their mantles? I didn't think so. But I digress...What sold me and so many other fans was the extended cuts. And so I began collecting the Ultimate Editions. And what excited me even more was the idea of more extended cuts to come, especially for The Order of the Phoenix.Then PoA and GoF Ultimate Editions came out, and of course, there were no extended cuts. And Warner Bros. spun us a tale of directors and their creative preferences. And so, we all said ""fair enough"" (although I, for one, never quite bought that explanation). Still, I had hopes for OotP and HBP. Director David Yates is on record talking about having to cut 45 minutes from The Order of the Phoenix. And yet, here we are again with no extended cut to speak of. I'm sure the studio will spin us a tale of how busy Yates has been with the final installment of the franchise, thus making it impossible to return to these previous films and give the fans what they want: An official ultimate collector's replica of a square of Hogwart's Toilet Paper.Oh, I meant AN EXTENDED CUT.Now, I understand Warner Bros. desire to get these editions on the shelves before the final film hits theaters. As for me, I would gladly wait a year for these editions if it meant getting to see extended cuts of the films. But this is not about the fans. This is about the bottom line. If the WB can get a half-@$$ product onto the shelves sooner, and therefore presumably make more money in the final season of Potter movie mania, then who cares what the fans want? We will buy anything with the word Ultimate in front of it. Or maybe not."	1.0	Once again, it seems... No extended cut.	2011-03-07	56	37	19

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX	magellan	"Since there are already over 600 reviews of this movie I'll just keep my comments brief and touch on a few points that I wanted to discuss.I enjoyed this movie overall but I have to say that it's the weakest and most problematic of all the Harry Potter movies, although it's not without some great high points, too. I note that many of the fans were disappointed in how much was cut from the original book, making the story arc somewhat disjointed and hard to follow. But then this was the longest, if I remember right, of all the Harry Potter novels and you just can't cram everything in even a modest sized book, let alone one this long, into a movie. But many characters who featured prominently in the book get very little screen time in this adaptation.But the movie does have its good points. The best thing is how you get to see the young wizards growing in their magic skills as they learn to do magical tricks like discharge energy, repulse an attacker by knocking him back through the air, perform stunts similar to psychokinesis by manipulating objects from afar, and so on. This aspect of the movie is the most fun.The problem is that there's a new, evil senior professor by the name of Ms. Umbridge who is almost bad enough to bring the whole movie screeching to a halt every time she appears. She will only teach the young magicians the theory, not the actual practical techniques of magic. This puts the students in a bind, because they still need to protect themselves from evil magicians like Voldemor and also pass their exams. There's also no explanation in the movie for this inexplicable policy of Umbridge's except she's a very bad person. But the young people show some grit and determination in their desire to learn no matter who or what gets in their way by forming an outside study group, which meets in secret to learn what they can on their own.But Umbridge is such a low, despicable character that the whole move suffers as a result. Not the least of these problems is that she runs around with a rigid, unchanging rictus of an expression on her face that's sort of like smug, arrogant complacency combined with a somewhat pinched, pained grimace as if she has terminal hemorrhoids. It's too extreme an affectation and caricature and makes every scene with this character hard to watch. I don't think I've ever had a more negative reaction to a character in a movie, and I usually don't even have much of a reaction to characters in movies. But her whole persona is an embarrassingly bad idea and low point for what was already a problematic Harry Potter movie. The only good thing you can say about the Umbridge character  is at least the name was a clever idea because of the allusion to the word, ""umbrage."" Well, I guess I take umbrage with Ms. Umbridge.Although there are some fun and enjoyable parts to the movie, and I still enjoyed it for the most part, again, the movie suffers from some bad characterization, a patchy and difficult to follow plot, and the loss of some important story elements from the book. It seems now that the Harry Potter kids are almost grown-up teenagers the Hogwarts Academy has lost its warts and gotten a bad case of acne. I still enjoyed the movie for the most part but in comparison with the other great movies in this series I can only give this one three stars at most."	3.0	A brief comment	2009-11-10	1	0	1

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A36R39737R5PC7	Marc M. Ponzio	"Every Harry Potter fan will probably enjoy this movie.  The acting is great, the effects are excellent, and the plot is good too.  I'm even starting to get used to the new guy as Dumbledore (although Richard Harris was amazing).  Harry, Ron, and Harmione are all back in full form for their fifth year.  The only problem that I can see with this movie is that it missed a lot of the really fun things about the 5th HP book.  Let me get one thing out before I move on... I loved the 5th book.  I know some people hated it mostly because of Umbridge, but I really enjoyed it.  So, moving on from there, there are some things that the book had but the movie really lacked.  For example; the scene in the book where Harry takes Dumbledore's Army into the Department of mysteries was so much more interesting in the book.  There was more effects, more magic, and a whole lot more to that scene in general.  One more example; they could have played up the Room of Requirement a bit.  Now I understand that this was the longest HP book, and I can't be angry at them for cutting some of the scenes to make the transfer to the silver screen.  I'm sure the movie would have been 6 hours long if they put in everything.  But you'd think that they might try to play out the most interesting scenes of the book (ie. the end before Harry Meets Voldemort and the training sequences) just a bit.  So, the only reason I withheld the 5th star is because in my opinion the movie needed a bit more of the ""fun"" stuff from the books.  Definitely give it a watch."	4.0	I ask the impossible	2008-01-21	2	2	0

Even with the books and the films and the games (and the toys) under my belt, I found myself scratching my head wondering 'what the hell?' is going on/happening with this story.This story marches right on through.  It was good, but it left me with the feeling of being hurried along.  I agree with the ""Cliff Notes"" review by one of the previous posters. The sense of wonder and amazement  that we experience through the eyes of our growing witches and wizards is restricted to a paper airplane in the shape bird at the beginning of our first class.My usual gripe with the films is that the wealth of talent is largely surpressed.  Helena Bonham Carter is thrilling but has maybe 3 lines and 3 minutes of screen time...if that much. Alan Rickman's Severus Snape is always delicious and never disappointing.  More...please?  Then there is the venerable Maggie Smith.  The routine and increasing neglect of her character is criminal.These are movies.  They contain rich characters...can we please see them or know something about them?The portrayal of Dolores Umbridge is worthy of an Oscar nod ... but probably won't get it because the Academy at large won't be able to figure out what is happening and why.Please, please, please give these great actors a role worth performing...the potential that is achievable yet never reached is aggravating as it is heart-breaking. Let us fall in love with the movies.  We all fell in love with the books as books, but film is a different medium.  Writing a larger role for Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman doesn't mean you have to change the goal of the story...you just don't have to follow the book page by page."	3.0	One more time: For Those Familiar With The Story Only!	2007-12-13	0	0	0

While there were some cuts I didn't like, for the most part they pulled it off.Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is back.  Or at least that's what Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) claim.  But the Ministry of Magic is denying these claims and the ""Daily Prophet"" is backing them up.As if that weren't bad enough, the Ministry has appointed the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) is going to teach the subject by textbook only.  There will be no practical part of the course.Harry and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are kept out of much of what is happening in the fight against Voldemort.  They know that Dumbledore has resurrected the Order of the Phoenix to fight the dark lord again, but they aren't allowed to join.  Yet Voldemort seems to be trying to communicate something to Harry.  What does he want?  Is Harry in danger?One thing that helped this movie was the art of the montage.  They used that several times to cut out the repetition from the book.  They also cut out a couple sub-plots, one I really loved, and some of the funny scenes from the book.  It was disappointing, but I could see the need to make room for important things.Still with all those cuts, they also cut out most of the Order of the Phoenix scenes.  What is there is great, and fans of the character Tonks especially won't be disappointed with what they see during her too short screen time.  And the ending was rushed, taking away the emotional impact while still covering all the important details.The only change that really bothered me was one near the middle that changed a character.  I know they had to cut out some characters, but the resulting damage to this remaining charater one really bothered me.If all this talk concerns you because you haven't read the books, don't let it.  I saw it with a friend who hasn't read any of the books, and he followed everything perfectly.But enough of my picking apart the plot.  What about the rest of the film?  As we've come to expect, the visuals are stunning.  And the cast does a great job as always.  Special praise goes to Evanna Lynch as new student Luna Lovegood and Imelda Staunton as Umbridge.  They both captured their characters from the book perfectly.As with the last film, this one is rather dark and scary, especially at the end.  Be sure to consider that when deciding whether to let your kids watch.No, it's not the book.  But until we get a long miniseries version, this is certainly a fine way to enjoy the story."	4.0	A Fine But Not Perfect Version	2007-12-14	2	1	1

I liked some more than others but it keeps up.  It presents some death and that adds to the plot thickness, not all can be safe always or it gets boring, and it adds conflict with the school heads by replacing them with some individuals you wish would get squished in the film.  Everyone likes the head of the school, the old wizard, but this one even gives him trouble and more questions for Harry Potter to answer plus some things he learns to know he did not in prior movies, it all adds up in the plot.	5.0	harry potter and the order of the phoenix	2008-01-14	0	0	0
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1YA9T56FDWZQK	Mars Caulton	"My son and I loved this movie -- and will be eagerly awaiting seeing it again when he is 12 or 13.  Obviously each year at Hogwart's brings a level of maturity in the characters, but that is marked in this one.  They portray that realistic, uneasy sense of the changes in how the boys and girls relate to each other now.  There is a greater depth in the relationships overall.  And the coming to terms of each character's possible mortality at any turn, as well as coming to terms with the ""Good vs Bad"" dichotomy failing miserably in a complex world.  But most notable is the extended culminating battle.  Because the characters on BOTH sides have revealed so much more than previously, as well as how it just wears the viewer down as it goes on and on, this round sinks in to a deeper level than previously, and I felt it thus had more potential to really unnerve younger viewers in the long run.This has been one of my favorites of the series.  It is also where I choose to cut off my 9 year old from watching any further until he's older."	4.0	Excellent movie -- heed the PG-13 rating	2011-09-19	2	2	0

The movie left all the Quidditch out... but let's face it, do we REALLY need the Quidditch? Can't the story be told as well without it. The answer is... YES!!!! The action was superb and the acting even better. The younger actors have really come out of their shell and feel comfortable in the roles they've performed since movie 1. I applaud the direction, special effects (especially the FIRE Snake via Voldemort), and of course, every actor who took part be it in a major role or a small bit part. BRAVO EVERYONE.

Of course, time constraints tend to dictate what is in a movie and what is not, so there are a lot of holes here, but what is left is another wonderful cinematic tale of Harry Potter and his world.Voldemort is back, but the Ministry of Magic, aided by the wizard newspaper, The Daily Prophet, is trying to convince the populace otherwise.  Harry is getting glimpses into the Dark Lords mind and Dumbledore fears that soon, Voldemort will realize this and use Harry's mind and thoughts to turn the tables on the Order of the Phoenix - the group dedicated to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's downfall.There is a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts, and she is hell-bent on not teaching the students the skills they will need to survive against the evils in their world.  Harry is recruited to teach a select few what he knows and what he has learned while fighting the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters.The movie culminates is a mighty battle between good and evil, and leaves us die-hard fans wishing for more.Mary AnnNatchez, MS	4.0	Another Potter of Gold	2009-08-23	0	0	0

But, don't say this is a great movie because it's not; it's simple, with a weak script, and lots of overacting. The Director changed and it's really noticeable, the script misses many important themes and moments from the book, and chooses to emphasize some more subtle and honestly more boring aspects of the story, ie: walking in the hall, some dialog, and cut aways; there's just too much transition here. If the editor did his job better the movie would've been 20 minutes shorter and flowed better. The director tried to make up for a bad script with a good ending and he succeeded. That's why I gave three stars. I don't think Harry came out as a very sympathetic character, but this wasn't my favorite book either.	3.0	Okay, but lacking continuity and mysticism	2008-01-08	2	0	2

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	Personally, the films are never going to live up to expectations, no one would simply sit on their backsides for long enough to see Order Of The Phoenix put into a film, scene for scene. You'd be there all day. So yes there are a lot of reviews that are going to say that it's the weakest movie, cos it's the shortest movie, made from the longest book. And I'm shocked at myself that I'm actually going to say I agree.I recently re-watched the films, and re-read the last three books. Re-watching the films, I discovered that however I much I liked the second movie first time round, Dobby annoyed me every time, and I found myself pressing the skip button. To me, the second movie is the weakest. But now Order Of The Phoenix is following closely behind. But I still like it.Order of the Phoenix the book had simply had too much filler in, and although I enjoy reading it, I do find myself skipping bits, particularly when Dolores Umbridge opens her mouth. She was by the worst character, but not a bad character, just dreadful the way she's portrayed. I was shocked when it was announced that Imelda Staunton would be playing her, and I couldn't imagine how this would work. Until she burst onto screen wearing an array of pink. From the nurse in Shakespeare In Love, to this, certainly a defining career highlight.Lots of stuff has obviously been cut, from important plot points to unnecessary bits. I did find myself watching the movie, and thinking about what had been cut, cos it was really disjointed at times. Dobby was completely cut (thank God for that!), so instead of him telling Harry about the Room of Requirement, it's Neville who finds out. We have to put up with Kreacher, but he barely features. We completely lose Quidditch in this movie, not even a glimpse of Ron letting in a goal (is it still a goal?) The ending seems to be slightly changed, and it's Cho who this time who tells Dolores about the Room of Requirement, and not her best friend, as it was in the book. St Mungo's is all but virtually cut out as well, as are Hermione & Ron's new roles as prefects.I'm disappointed to say that Ron is virtually non-existent in this film, which is a pity, he seems to be shunted aside to introduce Luna Lovegood, and give her more of a role. It's not a good thing that Ron is basically hardly in the film at all. Other reviewers seem to be raving about his comedic timing, he's hardly there!!!The finale seems very tame compared to the book, and I wasn't impressed. I thought the scene where Remus Lupin was holding Harry back, was well done, as it was completely silent apart from a truly brilliant score behind it. And I've always loved the main Harry Potter 'theme' ever since the first film, but there was a whole new dimension added to it to this time, bringing a darker, more haunting theme.I have to say I was not keen on Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore in this film. Stepping into the late Richard Harris' shoes was very brave, but what Dumbledore does during this film is explained at the end, but I still didn't like Michael Gambon.There were some excellent casting decisions in this film - Helena Bonham Carter put in a surprising appearance as Bellatrix Lestrange, a witch-like but incredibly sexy woman, who's a cousin or something to Sirius, but has gone over to the bad side. She was just simply not on screen enough. Neither was the actress who played Nymphadora Tonks, or just Tonks if you will, part of the Order, who can change her hair, clothes, facial features with her flick of her wand. She was a brilliant character in the book, but is sadly underused in this. Apart from a glimpse at the start, and at the end. She was gorgeous too, and I loved how her hair changed when Mad Eye Moody called her Nymphadora! I'm not sure about Luna, played by Evanna Lynch. She was a great little character, but she was just too kooky, and she seemed to have a bit more interaction in the book.I can imagine there's a few people out there who will be very disappointed with Order Of The Phoenix, but personally, I'm counting down the days the next film!

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2556JDR1JTVEP	"M. Eilman ""Fantasy Fanatic"""	Even though this was the most poorly written of the seven books, the film should have been able to correct this.  Where the book dragged on endlessly in some scenes, the film instead cuts the scenes it does choose to include so short that you really are not sure what is going on.  Several scenes I'm left wondering what really happened, and I've even read the book!  To make it worse, several great scenes from the book were missing or completely altered to be something completely different.  I cannot imagine what kind of ego it takes to alter moments from immensely popular book (the reason this movie is even being made).In short, you have to watch it because the first four were so good, and the next two (I hope!) will be good movies, but the bottom line is this movie was poor.	2.0	Really a poor film that could have been great.	2007-12-17	5	2	3
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1AYN3IIUNQCIA	"Melanie Edwards ""book worm"""	Like a good wine, the Harry Potter film series are something that grow better with age and the fifth adaptation of the book series does not fail to impress. As many have said before, Order of the Pheonix is by far the darkest (and shortest, go figure) film to date. It's hard to imagine the days of the light and frothy Sorceror's Stone, with its wonderous surprises, colorful displays, and an eleven year olds joy. Now, the series, likes the books, have aged into more mature subject matter, dealing with the likes of goverment conspiracies, war, death, and sinister villians. Now, i will say that this is not my favorite HP film (that honor still goes with Prisoner of Azkaban), but it is still a rather solid adaptation of the book as a whole.We join Harry after the events of Goblet of Fire, the beginning setting the tone for the entire film. Harry is angry, confused, and plain frustrated for everything that's happened the previous year. And to make matters worse, this year is no better. The Ministry has already begun a full out smear campaign on our young hero and the wise wizard Dumbledore, absolutly refusing to believe Voldemort is back, who is already assembling his army once more to strike the defensless wizadring community. And just when he thinks he can find solace with his friends Ron and Hermione and the school he loves so much, in walks Dolores Umbridge, a manic, power-hungry woman out to do the Ministry's bidding and restore supposed 'order' to Hogwarts school. On top of that, Harry must also deal with the frightning dreams he has begun to experince, that may very well be a clue to what Voldemort is planning next.All the performers bring there A game here. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson, much like their characters, have matured with age and put to rest any doubts about there acting skills. Returning actors like Rickman, Gambon, Smith, Oldman, and Coltrane are all supurb, making the most of there sometimes small roles. But its truley the newcomer's who deserve the kudos. Evanna Lynch is absolutly brillinat as the spacey Luna Lovegood, while Helena Bonham Carter turns such a tiny role into a firecracker of a performance as the crazed Bellatrix Lestrange. And finally, Imelda Staunton brings the best performance in the film as the diabolical Professor Umbridge. An absoulty horrid woman, disguised by a too sweet fascade that makes your skin crawl. Oh and she also does the laugh justice.As usual, HP fans will have a lot to complaign about with the substantial cuts from the book, especially the whole 'Weasley is our King', so for those who are extremly touchy over this, Order of the Pheonix will most likely dissapoint you. And to those who feel the film may be to dark, it does have some rather clever comidic parts. But for the others, people should be rather pleased with the evenly paced flow of the movie cause i have to say, though i loved Goblet of Fire, i felt it was very choppy at parts, seemingly jumping from one scene to the next in a frentic hurry, almost to try and fit in as much as possible into the time. So for me, i say the cuts were necesarry, cause this film hardly felt cluttered or rushed.So, in closing, to all those picky HP fans, this movie will not satisfy. But for the rest of us, it will still make for a magical time.	5.0	Another solid HP film	2007-11-16	3	3	0

The graphics were superb, but at great cost to the film. I was incredibly disappointed at the aweful portrayal of the fifth book and will not likely watch it more than one more time. Had I not read the book, I would have not understood a single thing that was going on because the movie was just all over the place. The significance of most of the characters was not exemplified and the only thing anyone could have gotten out of it was Voldemort was evil and tricked Harry into getting a glowing sphere. There were many things missing in which the movie could benefitted more by following the book. The only part which I thought was extremely captivating was when all of Dumbledore's Army was punished with the special quill. The look on the Weasly twin's face (I think it was Fred) really captured the moment of agony and disgust.	2.0	By far the WORST Harry Potter movie	2007-07-30	11	4	7

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3KEZLJ59C1JVH	Melissa Niksic	"I was apprehensive about going to see ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" because I was very disenchanted by the last film in the series, ""Goblet of Fire."" However, ""Phoenix"" surpassed all my expectations. There are a few small things about the movie that bothered me, but overall, I think it was brilliant.This film is based on the fifth novel in the Harry Potter series. I'm sure most people are familiar with the plot, but basically this is Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts, and it gets off to a very crappy start. The Ministry of Magic attempts to expel Harry from school because he used magic to defend himself when dementors attacked him and his cousin, Dudley. Also, the majority of people think that Harry and Professor Dumbledore are lying about the return of Lord Voldemort, and everyone treats Harry like he has the plague. To top it all off, the Ministry has appointed one of its own members, Dolores Umbridge, to fill the vacant position of Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher at Hogwarts. Umbridge wastes no time wreaking havoc in the school and using all means necessary to put the Ministry's stamp on things. Meanwhile, Harry is distraught over mysterious dreams and visions that disturb him in his sleep. The film builds up to Harry's discovery of a new connection he has to Voldemort, and everything culminates in a violent encounter deep within the confines of the Department of Mysteries.I was blown away by this movie. It was just as dark and gritty as I'd hoped it would be, and as it needed to be in order to stay true to the book. Obviously, a lot of material had to be cut for the film adaptation, but I think the screenwriters did an excellent job editing the unnecessary parts and making the story flow together so smoothly on screen.Here are some of my favorite things about the film, along with a few gripes. (Warning: The rest of this review contains major spoilers, so continue reading at your own risk!)+ The new additions to the cast were amazing, especially the actresses who played Bellatrix LaStrange (Helena Bonham Carter), Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) and Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch). Bonham Carter is amazing in everything she does, and the first time I read ""Phoenix,"" I knew she had to play Bellatrix...I just wish she had a bit more screen time! Staunton was absolutely perfect as Umbridge. I would have enjoyed seeing Umbridge's character be slightly more sinister at times, but really, I have no complaints. And as for Lynch, she was born to play the part of Luna Lovegood, hands down!+ The thestrals looked awesome, as did Kreacher the house elf.+ I thought Harry's relationship with Cho Chang was very sweet and well done. Their kiss under the mistletoe was so cute!+ The appearance of the Dark Mark tattoo on the Death Eaters was very well done: super creepy!+ The Ministry of Magic looked incredible in the film: it was just like I imagined it while reading the book. I was also quite impressed with the scene depicting the jailbreak from Azkaban: very slick!+ Generally, most of the plot changes were very slight and only served to better enhance the story for the screen (Harry seeing the memory of his father and Snape by using occlumency instead of spying in the pensieve; the Weasley twins only causing one major disturbance for Umbridge; etc.)- The character of Tonks (Natalia Tena) was introduced for the first time in this film. She looked really cool, but we didn't get to see much of her, which was a shame.- Speaking of missing characters, where the heck was Mundungus Fletcher?! His absence didn't really affect the plot of the movie too much, but I'm sure there were many fans of the book that were disappointed Mundungus was cut out altogether.- Rita Skeeter and Professor Lockhart were also missing from the film. Again, their absences didn't hurt the movie, but I was really hoping for a brief Kenneth Branagh cameo.- I don't understand why Kreacher's role in the whole trick involving Sirius wasn't played up more. We saw Kreacher twice, and Sirius even gave him the order to ""go away,"" but no one ever explained how Kreacher was the one who helped Voldemort lure Harry into coming to the Ministry.- There was no Sirius/Snape confrontation. Major bummer!- We never saw Dumbledore instruct Snape to meet up with Voldemort and the rest of the Death Eaters. This is the one omission from the film that bothered me the most. The significance of that event plays a big part in book seven, so I wonder how it will be explained in the next film.- Although the final scenes at the Ministry were good, I was a little disappointed with the way Sirius was killed. He never really dueled it out with Bellatrix: she just sort of appeared and mumbled ""avada kedavra"" under her breath, and it was all over. It should have been much more dramatic with more build-up to it. Also, it was never explained how Dumbledore and the other members of the Order knew that Harry and his friends were at the Ministry that night. Finally, the whole Harry/Voldemort possession thing at the end was kind of weird. I guess all these things were done in the essence of time and to make things look more dramatic on screen, but I think it could have been a bit better.Despite a few minor flaws, ""Phoenix"" is possibly the best Harry Potter film yet. I think the movie really stayed true to the spirit of the book, and I enjoyed it very much. I'll probably go back to see it in the theatre at least once more."	5.0	"""Phoenix"" rises to the occasion"	2007-07-12	8	7	1

I've watched all the harry potter films because as bad as they are, i want to see what they did to it and i wasnt disappointed. This movie has so much fodder people were tripping over it in the theater aisles. Knowing that this was the longest book in the series some things were bound to be omitted. But the screenwriters keep making the same mistake. They cut out parts of the book that lead one to the other. This movie was extremely short but it doesnt feel like it. I kept looking at my watch and being surpriseed 2 hours hadnt passed. I'm a diehard of the books so i'm not going to be pleased completely but that doesnt mean i can't find it watchable. I enjoyed the 3rd movie immensely but it just gets worse when the books get darker and darker.

In the beginning of the film, Harry uses his powers to protect himself and his cousin from an attack from Dementors, but ends up getting expelled from Hogwarts due to using his magic in front of a Muggle. However, he gets reinstated but Delores Umbridge, who works for The Ministry of Magic, gets promoted to Professor of the Dark Arts position at the school. She abuses her position by teaching the students the theory but not the practice of magic, telling them that there is nothing to fear or fight against, making Harry out to be a liar and becoming a bit tyrannical and bitchy.This all leads to the inevitable showdown with Valdemort and Harry knows the dark days are ahead. Ive never read any of the Potter books, to be honest; perhaps someday i shall, but i do love the films. From the very first one til now, the movies have intrigued me and i really like the ideas present in them. Its easy to see why Potter has such a huge global fanbase. I find the films extremely complex themselves, yet I love them just for the fantasy elements and the characters and their situations, plus also the fact that as time goes on, the series gets progressively darker and disturbing. Daniel Radcliffe does a very great job as Harry and is assisted by a strong supporting cast: Emma Watson as Hermione, Rupert Grint as Ron, Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, etc."	5.0	Things are getting darker for Harry....	2010-12-15	0	0	0

As it turned out, I caught all the glitz just fine on my large-ish TV. It was the dialogue that gave me trouble. From the very first scene, the actors seemed to mumble more than half their lines and I'm sure I missed a lot of the by-play. And since I haven't read the novels (Yet. Maybe.), I didn't even know what I was missing. But my wife, who has read them all at least twice, assures me that was much, much more that ought to have been said about Neville's parents, and about the revolt of George & Fred, and that there's a great deal more to say about Luna Lovegood and Sybil Trelawney, etc. I know it's the fattest of the seven Harry Potter books, and I'm perfectly aware that any good screenplay based on a novel is obliged to discard many of the subplots, but even so, two hours and a quarter apparently just wasn't enough, so they had to zip past a lot of important information. I shall have to get hold of the screenplay and read along when I rewatch the film -- and I will.	3.0	This film definitely has problems	2007-12-19	1	0	1
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3D9KO6R1JB845	Michael Sloane,Tempe,Arizona,United States of...	"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix gets an O for Outstanding. The book to movie translation of Order of the Phoenix was seamless. Daniel,Rupert,and Emma all give their best performances of the 1st 5 films in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. All 3 have settled into their main roles quite nicely by this point and their performance gives the movie a solid foundation. Then the connection between Harry and Voldemort is well done. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is largely a story about the connection between Harry and Voldemort and the film carries this out well. Then the scenes between Harry and Snape provide us with some fantastic acting. I've always liked Alan Rickman's Snape,and those Occlumency scenes,especially in the later ones where Snape is criticizing Harry's father and Harry is defending his father,show some real tension between Harry and Snape. You can truly feel the tension between Harry and Snape in these scenes. And I LOVED Luna Lovegood. Luna is a character who I became a far bigger fan of after the movies came out. Evanna Lynch is a PERFECT Luna. And the movie does a good job of showing you,especially in that scene towards the end in the corridor,that Harry and Luna are true friends and not just ""buddy buddy."" The harry-Luna friendship is one of my favorites in the Harry Potter series because it transcends age,year,gender,and even house. Luna became the closest friend Harry ever had outside of Gryffindor house and I really appreciate the Harry-Luna friendship for this reason. As for the Dumbledore-Voldemort duel in the Department of Mysteries,well that greatness of that scene speaks for itself. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix does a fantastic job of book to movie translation,as unimportant things such as Qudditch are left out and important things such as Dumbeldore's Army,the battles in the Department of Mysteries,and the prophecy are included. My only criticism is that Marietta Edgecombe should have been in the movie and been the D.A. traitor. Marrieta was the traitor in the book and she should have been the traitor in the movie. Cho Chang should have been cut from the movie herself,not given Marietta's role. Still,I felt so fulfilled and satisfied when I walked the theatre for the 1st time after seeing this movie that I can't give it anything less than 5 stars.  Watching Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a 5 star experience."	5.0	Harry Potter's Order Achieves An Oustanding O.W.L.	2013-02-18	2	2	0

Soon Harry finds himself on trial for having used magical powers to save himself and his cousin.  Voldemort's (Fiennes) presence is felt everywhere.  The Ministry of Magic denies he is alive.  Those at Hogwarts, specifically the Order of the Phoenix, know better.  To stop the truth from getting out, the Ministry sends Dolores Umbridge (Staunton) to Hogwarts.  She gradually begins to seize power, punishing those students and teacher who dare to challenge her.  Meanwhile, Harry is having visions and teaching his classmates himself to prepare them for an inevitable showdown.Gone are the lighter days of ""Harry Potter"" 1 & 2.  ""Order of the Phoenix"" is firmly traveling down the dark road that will end two movies in the future.  The movies have grown up, and that is very welcome.  Each is better than the one before, and ""Order of the Phoenix"" is no exception.  The actors could play their characters in their sleep at this point, and returning to the wizard world is like visiting old friends.  Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson have all become the beloved characters at this point, and the supporting cast has accomplished the same with less screen time.  David Yates brings yet another voice to the director's chair, and pulls it off despite limited motion picture experience.  ""Order of the Phoenix"" is another fine film in what is probably one of the most significant movie franchises ever.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1D1MIFRSG50Y3	Mike S.	Like many reviewers I feel that all the Ultimate Editions should have extended versions of the films offered as the first two did.  Yes, the deleted scenes are included in the special features, but it would be nice to see them incorporated into the movie itself.Harry Potter is a series that (for the most part)got progressively better with each movie.  Due to the fact that the actors got better as they grew up, and the books got better as they transitioned from being kids books to the darker books they became.  This one has a lot more violence and death than all the others.  Including one of the first central characters.  And unlike Cedric in the previous movie, it is a character that has been developed more, so there is some emotional investment there.This movie introduces the characters of Luna Lovegood and Delores Umbridge.  Both parts are cast perfectly in my opinion.  They very much conveyed the sense that Umbridge was borderline evil, definitely sadistic and always up to no good.  I liked the final battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore, but I think they could have made it longer.  Given that this was the shortest of the films, they should have put as much as possible into that battle.  Plus, they certainly could have added in some other elements from the books, like fleshing out the Snape and Lilly Potter storyline.The movie does set up a lot, but not as much as the book does.  The extras on the special feature disc are again top notch.  I got them mainly for the Making of series that spanned the entire set of Ultimate Editions.  It was not a double dip for me since I had not purchased the theatrical editions before.  Whether you want to spend for the ultimate edition will really depend on whether you have purchased the movie in another format, and if you want the special features included in the UE.	4.0	Good movie that should have an extended edition	2013-03-24	2	2	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AUSATFDSU2INS	"milss ""Yellow hair warrior"""	"The filmmakers behind Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix have done something unbelievable. Not only they have parted completely from the light and happy world created by the first two films, but they've also ignored any type of film summary. There's no synopsis of everything that's gone before. And good for that, I say. Go rent the other four if you need to catch up.Year five at Hogwarts begins with our hero Harry angrier than ever. Harry has spent the summer being ignored by everyone after he was discredited by the Daily Prophet for daring to suggest that Lord Voldemort has returned.Once again, Harry and company will have to fight he-who-shall-not-be-named while combating an government that insists and refuses to acknowledge the return of Voldemort. In doing so, the government steps up and introduces a new headmistress at Hogwarts: Dolores Umbridge.You will find that these are indeed ""darker"" times for all the HP characters. Working with writer Michael Goldenberg, director David Yates have crafted a dark tale to entertain anyone watching. The effects shows us fantastic creatures. But it's the performances where a film is really sold and here they are wonderful.The three leads, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, have all settled easily into their roles. But it's in the supporting cast where these films really shine. Filling out secondary roles with the cream of British theatre and cinema, like Gary Oldman, Imelda Staunton, Helena Bonham Carter, David Thewlis and Ralph Fiennes, everyone else must rise to their level, and they do.The movie shows us the ""weird"" phase we all go between adult and child, between doing what's right and following the rules and between knowledge and comprehension. When all is said and done, Harry has grown as a character. He is on his way to adulthood with an understanding of the things he's learned in the previous four films.However, there are worrying signs that there are no real developments from film to film: there are no substantial increase in maturity in the films themselves. Every time I sit down to a new Harry Potter movie, I'm surprised by how very similar it is to the previous one.There is a definite feel with The Order of the Phoenix that the story is killing time - setting the scene for the battles yet to come in the last two chapters. This isn't a criticism as such, it's just that having to do that does leave a few unanswered questions.

Rowling has written each successive book for a slightly older child, and parents should purchase each book/movie roughly a year apart as their child grows older.  This movie follows the book as closely as possible.  Just as in ""Goblet of Fire,"" though, the movie must focus on the main storyline, Harry's fight for the truth of Voldemort's return.Harry is still tormented by the death of Cedric Diggory, and his brush with Voldemort.  Now he finds he is being blackballed by the ministry itself.  Not surprising he is angry.  Imelda Staunton is very good as the dutiful public servant who will happily torture for the public good.  This is the most important thing this movie/book says.  Beware those who say the end justifies the means.  Beware those who quash the truth to maintain an illusion of order.Special effects in the movie are mostly at the end.  The caverous hall of prophecy crashing down is amazing.  However, the battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort was changed.  In the book, Dumbledore uses the statues in the fountain to fend off Voldemort's attack, confounding him.  In the movie he barely survives Voldemort's attack.  All in all, this movie is my least favorite.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" adopts a menacing tone as the Voldemort spreads his influence over the wizarding world. After Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and cousin Dudley are attacked by dementors, the life-sucking creatures that guard Azkaban prison, Harry is whisked away to the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, a secret organization sworn to combat the forces of the Dark Lord. Soon he is back at Hogwarts School, having barely escaped expulsion for the underage use of magic in self-defense. But defamatory press against his allies and protectors, the insistence by well-meaning adults that Harry be kept in the dark about matters that most concern him, and a new insidious Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, Delores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), put Harry in a persistently foul mood. If that were not enough, Harry is plagued by visions of Voldemort's scourge.The most fun in the Harry Potter movies is often found in the extravagant behavior of Hogwarts teachers, and ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" pulls another coup on that front. Megalomania has never been so entertaining as when coupled with Delores Umbridge's sweetness and pastels. The film doesn't make light of the dire situation suffered by students and staff. Umbridge's spying and prying at Hogwarts is a thinly veiled Inquisition. Her efforts to stamp out individualism through Draconian policies are condemned as products of fear and egotism. A stark message made more than palatable by Imelda Staunton's gift for caricature. Evanna Lynch gives an especially charming performance among the students, as the eccentric, spacey Luna Lovegood. A new set, the interior of the Ministry of Magic is eye-catching but too CGI for my taste.

The internal monologue character's have with themselves can never be adequately transmitted onto the silver screen without extending the movie to a running time of several days.  Likewise, facial expressions and nuances of body language portrayed by actors can only be transferred to the page by the most gifted of authors.  In other words, saying that ""the book was better"" seems a bit off, rationally-speaking.Well, this time the book is not better.  J.K Rowling's fifth book in the popular ""Harry Potter"" series was a bloated, rambling affair which entertained only if you were able to ""buzz"" through the chaff.  Director David Yates cuts through the fluff, strengthens the plotline, and improves the focus of a story which desperately required such changes.  Fans need not worry--although there are some noticeable changes, the movie remains true to the book.The film opens with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his semi-relative Dudley again about to lock horns when the duo is attacked by Dementors, those demonic Azkaban guards capable of instilling everlasting ennui in the minds of their victims.  Harry uses the Patronus charm to dispel the fiends, thus saving his own and Dudley's souls.  Unfortunately, the usage of magic off the grounds of Hogwarts in the presence of Muggles is strictly forbidden for underage spellcasters, thus provoking Harry's immediate expulsion from school.  Luckily, he is permitted an appeal before the Ministry of Magic, where he possesses as ace-in-the-hole the most influential wizard alive:  Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon).  From there, the protagonist is thrust into a dazzling game of political brinksmanship, where the players are willing to evade facts to retain a feeling of security.  However, the fate of the world remains unclear, ignored by those seeking to play their games and hide from one, terrible truth:  Lord Voldemort has returned.Defense Against the Dark Arts instructors are changed as rapidly as ""Harry Potter"" movie directors, and we find the same in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.""  Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), an associate of Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, has accepted the position, and quickly reveals herself to be short on instruction and long on malice.  In the name of efficiency, she enacts as series of increasingly-stifling edicts, targets Harry for punishment whenever he professes that Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is gathering his forces, and attempts to undermine Professor Dumbledore's authority.  The truly vile nature of this character does not come across as clearly in the movie as in the text, and that is probably a good thing--this creation from Rowling's imagination is a near-sociopath who inflicted many readers with a desire to reach through the pages to strangle her.  The lengths to which she and Fudge go to suppress the truth conjure up the ghosts of Neville Chamberlain and Joe McCarthy in the mind of the viewer.  That she believes she is a force of good in the struggle against the dark is a terrifyingly subtle commentary on the real nature of delusion.  As an aside, if you would enjoy seeing a situation in which not one, but two characters like Umbridge do not get their comeuppance, may I gingerly suggest watching ""Funny Games.""Of course, Harry is not without allies as he remains stalwart.  His twin pillars of fortitude, Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), provide much-needed reservoirs of strength to our hero as he confronts Umbridge, Voldemort, and a deadly new horror:  first love.  Heroism itself is examined thoroughly in the film, and is shown to contain several sharp edges us mundane citizens may never understand.  He sees that his peers expect him to lead, to save others, to sacrifice his normal life, and to triumph against the forces of night.  Indeed, he is coming closer to an ultimate epiphany:  that his life is, figuratively and literally, not his own to live.  His existence is irrevocably tied to his duty, and coming to gripes with this fact is something with which Harry struggles constantly.  Unfortunately, his personal demons are sharing space with some real-world evil entities--one of which who may just be able to read Harry's thoughts.""The Order of the Phoenix"" is dark without being dreary.  Harry's relationship with his fugitive uncle Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), his bittersweet attempt at romance, and the antics of the Weasley twins help balance the tone of the film.  The set design is uniformly impressive, and the realism of the otherworldly creatures can easily suspend one's disbelief.  There were a few sections from the book that I would have preferred included in the film; nevertheless, one's enjoyment is preserved throughout the entirety of the movie, despite the disappearance of a certain screaming portrait.  The acting is quite good, with the exception of some of the actors portraying Aurors and Deatheaters.  In summary, all of our favorite friends have returned to populate a realm which exists only in Rowling's mind, yet Yates makes them seem real enough to the rest of us Muggles.  This is one of the better film translations thus far, and well-worth the time of any aficionado of mysteries from the magical world."	4.0	Harry realizes how fear of evil's return acts as rot upon even the best of intentions	2008-12-08	2	1	1

There were many key elements left out or never properly developed especially Luna Lovegood. As a rabid Harry Potter book fan, I can only plead with Warner Brothers to make our last two visits with our friends at Hogwarts more complete, and at LEAST 3 hours long. Us true Potter fans would gladly sit through 3 and perhaps 4 hours just to see the true story unfold. Whatever happened to intermission? That aside, I loved Dumbledore's Army and the training sessions, and of course, the comeuppance of Prof. Umbridge!

Overall, the movie was really good, but again, I think that you have to have read the book and know the epic story to appreciate the movie. I can't imagine just seeing the movie without ever at least reading the books. Like I'm sure most fans, so much was eliminated from the movie and we all had certain favorite parts cut. I felt this most profoundly during the first time I saw it at a IMAX 3-D showing, which was kind of distracting actually. But now that I own the movie and have viewed it twice, I'm getting over my initial disappointment. What hasn't changed, since my first book reading, is that I just love to hate Professor Umbridge!!

The main reason for my staying to the end of the movie was the neat and sophisticated work of art.A university for magic? As if the author could not occupy herself with more constructive fiction that betters our troubled world!!  Phony professors packaging memories in bottles? Though the bottles, the lab setups, the school landscape, and the old chemistry books all looked impressive and real, their use was put to no good cause.Assuming that the work of fiction should not be held to the test of logical reasoning, it should at least serve some constructive goal. Here, the story of the whole movie is loose and fragmented stream of imagery that could only be seen in bad dreams.Even bad dreams have some sort of logical connection between their events, which this movie completely lacked. Neither the dizzying fiction stretches our imagination, not did it conclude in relieving a stressing desire.The only purpose of the movie in my opinion was getting graphic artists busy is a jobless world.	3.0	Purposeless fiction.

I didn't like how a lot of the characters were given nothing to do this time around. Even Ron and Hermoine didn't have as much dialogue. With each film throwing in new characters and the old ones staying around, these movies are getting quite congested. For the first time, the story itself seemed to be just a set up for the last two movies, with no clear resolution.This film is the darkest one yet in the series and they really cut down on the humorous scenes. I did like most of the acting, as well as, the SFX.Not the best in the series by far, but worthy of the Harry Potter name.	4.0	For a Harry Potter film, it falls in the middle of the pack	2007-07-11	0	0	0

For example when Harry's Uncle is speaking to him in the fire it's different. I preferred the special effects for that scene in Goblet of Fire. Not only that the Dementors looked silly in this film, they looked much better in the Prisoner of Azkaban. The other problem I had was the fight between Dumbledore and Voldemort seemed rather cheesy and over too fast.I did however feel this movie was way better then Spider-man 3 and still say that Goblet of Fire is my favorite so far in the series.	3.0	Could Have Been Better	2007-11-28	5	2	3

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3H6JJCM19UV5O	MPE43	It's true. With a franchise as fanatically beloved as Harry Potter, a 3+ or even 4+ hour presentation of 'The Order of the Pheonix' surley would not have lost the studio money? In fact, I am convinced such a long running time would have INCREASED the already bloated box office for this film. The fans would have had MORE incentive to go back and see it again. I have often wondered whether anyone in Hollywood has learned anything from the Lord of the Rings trilogy? (If I had had the money, I would have seen Return of the King daily for ten straight days in the theater.)ADHD culture? No way, with a fine story, the time goes by in a flash. Alas, we'll have to wait for the next great literary saga to be made into properly epic films.Anyway, about this film as it stands. First, MAJOR congratulations to the beautiful Evanna Lynch for her wonderfully dreamy performance as Luna. She made the movie worth watching for me. In fact, the reason I give this film an extra star is because they devote a surprisingly large amount of screen time to her. (Her emotional discussion of loss with Harry near the end was a surprise and delight to see survive the editing process.)Rupert Grint seems to have lost his annoying adolescent voice breaks, and talks and acts worthy of his underrated character. And of course, Imelda Staunton was great as Umbridge. Michael Gambon is a fine actor, but his Dumbledor is not as good humored as his book persona (his lifelessness during the famous escape scene in his office is a case-in-point). Rickman, Radcliffe, Watson, Oldman, Thewlis, Wright, Lewis, and Issacs were all excellent as usual. Ralph Fiennes' Voldemort was actually menacing this time, unlike the silly Hare Krishna he seemed to be in Goblet of Fire.The strong point of this movie is the same as the book: Dumbledor's Army. The scenes where Harry is teaching his classmates the Patronus spell are absolutley wonderful.However, there were some story cuts that were just unforgivable, thus the low rating on my part.First, what happened to THE MIRROR?! If you recall the book, Sirius gives Harry a mirror through which he can communicate with him at any time. Harry, caught up in the stress-fest that is his life, forgets to use it when he senses Sirius is in danger. After Sirius's death, he remembers the mirror, and smashes it in grief. That could have been a powerfully emotional scene in the movie, and I'm at a loss to guess why it was cut. (It would have only added ten minutes to the film, tops!)The second unforgivable cut was Neville's visit to his broken parents at the mental hospital, and Harry+co's reaction. That was a pivotal moment for Neville and would have made the movie's climatic battle with Lestrange (played superbly by Helena Bonham-Carter I might add) more involving.Nevertheless, this film is by far the most enjoyable of the five Potter movies so far. The sets, the score, and the editing were all thrilling. But make sure to read the book again, and especially so if you've never read it, because this is the zenith of the Harry Potter saga in my opinion, before Half Blood Prince put a serious dampener on the series' potential.....	2.0	If you lengthen it, they will come......	2007-07-22	4	2	2

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1LHPZYIAF3COL	Mr. Borderman	A lethal combination of bad screenwriting and hack direction.  The nuances introduced in Potter movies 3 and 4 by Cuaron and Newell are jettisoned.  Cuaron's sly take on book 3, his ability to suggest the pending sexual awakening of the three main characters, and the sexual ambivalence in some of the other characters, all wrapped in sinuous action, rescued the movies from the clueless Chris Columbus.  Newell built on this, and brought the young actors to carefully shaded and detailed performances, performances that linger in the mind well after the FX have faded.  Phoenix removes virtually every trace of character development, every trace of humor, and the spirit of fun that bubbled in the first four films is crushed in a wall of stony compositions and unfeeling visual effects.  Emotionally cold and depressing, and even more depressing to find out that Yates is being brought back for the sixth film.  Heaven forbid they give him the final two films.  Bring back Cuaron and Newell!	1.0	Poison pen	2008-07-10	6	3	3
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3T0OTH5072YRE	"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming"""	The Order of the Phoenix is the fifth book/movie in the Harry Potter series.  If you're reading this without starting at the beginning, you need to stop here and go back.  There's really no point in starting in the middle of things.  As for this movie, I think they really did great in the beginning with the series, but starting with the fourth movie, things seem to be slipping a bit.Harry Potter doesn't start off his fifth year very well.  After defending himself against Dementors, he is almost expelled for using magic while underaged.  Even worse, Voldemort is back and noone seems to believe him outside of those closest to him.  In fact, the Ministry is making him look like a fool and actually posting one of their own within Hogwarts school.  And she's a terrible nightmare, who just seems to have it in for Harry.  With Voldemort growing stronger and the kids at Hogwarts not as protected as they should be, it's a recipe for disaster.Characters:Daniel Radcliffe: Harry PotterRupert Grint: Ron WeasleyEmma Watson: Hermione GrangerHelena Bonham Carter: Bellatrix LestrangeRobbie Coltrane: Rubeus hagricRalph Fiennes: Lord VoldemortBrendan Gleeson: Mad Eye MoodyMichael Gambon: Albus DumbledoreGary Oldman: Sirius BlackEvanna Lynch: Luna LovegoodAlan Rickman: Severus SnapeI had noticed in the fifth book that Harry seemed much much angrier than ever before.  I think Radcliffe pulled that off in this movie, but due to the limited scenes we never really know why he's as angry as he is.  Sure there's some stuff that happens that would make anyone angry, but it wasn't nearly as well explained as it was in the book.  Watson and Grint still backed him up well, and it just wouldn't be the right movie without the three of them in it.  Gambon as Dumbledore I still have mixed feelings about.  That warmth is still missing from him, although he does have that commanding presence.  I do have to say I absolutely loved Lynch as Luna Lovegood and though she did a fantastic job; spacey yet caring.The plot somewhat follows the book, but once again certain elements are missing that just really make the story.  Sometimes you need a little backstory on things and it was sadly lacking here.  Those scenes that were included were rushed and jumbled and didn't really give a good feel on what the whole story is all about.  A lot of it would have just been easy to make conversation scenes too, but would have held so much information that they would sitll have been important.  Still, the action scenes were well done and they returned a little of the detail in this book, especially within the Ministry of Magic itself.  So I did appreciate that they tried to make the scenes look as authentic as possible.  I just wish they would have spent as much time as that on the story too.The scenes, as said before, were well done.  Lots of detail and the use of magic was visually stunning.  I especially liked the battles scenes and the way they zipped about the screen.  Very neat way of showing that.  The moving pictures are always fantastic, although in the case of Umbridge, the evil teacher, her kitty pictures were almost as loathsome as they sounded in the book, and I even like cats!  They did a good job of recreating that.  The music was still good, but not at the forefront like it is with most of the other movies.  There's still the classic opening song, which I love though, so that's the most important thing.If they start going back to the plot these movies will definitely improve.  I know they can do it, they did it in the first few, so here's hoping they improve!Review by M. Reynard 2012	3.0	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix	2012-09-27	1	0	1

With ""The Order of the Phoenix"" you can point exactly to where the fun stopped and the franchise died.  800 pages of Harry scowling and barking at everyone was no day at the beach and, unfortunately, the movie is true to its literary source.  And no, I will not purchase this movie nor any others that follow; as far as I'm concerned the series ended with The Goblet of Fire.  It's a shame J. K.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2Y8DPOABNLKSE	"Mr. Randall William Wilcox ""Movie Man Man"""	"Well, we now have five years of Harry Potter's life on DVD, and what a stunning year ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" was, visually.  Yes, I said visually.  David Yates did an AMAZING job putting this film together.  The visual effects were stunning.  The sets and locations were brilliant as usual.  The young cast has grown into fine performers, and the adult cast continues to shine.  The music fit the world perfectly and the costumes were great.  Yet, there was one disappointment with film and I wouldn't consider that large on a grand scale.  It was the adaption.J. K. Rowling's fifth novel is pivotal and continues to change Harry's life in dark ways.  It was amazing, and Ms. Rowling created one of the most hated characters ever.  That character is Professor Umbridge.  I consider it a mark of great pennmanship if an author is able to create a character that is ment to be hated and actually hated when read.  I don't find many authors capable of that quality.  Imelda Staunton did a wonderful job of bringing Umbridge to life in the movie.  The problem with the movie was that it was too darn short in comparison to the novel.  Too much of the story was cut out of the movie.  The film makers should have split this film into two.Many people think that the novel of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" was boring and slow.  I disagree.  There were so many fun, and entertaining moments in the novel that would have been great in the movie, even if they didn't have much to do with the greater plot.  Quidditch is one example.  It is a fun little part of the world Ms. Rowling created and the fans love it.  The makers of the film should have included it in the film for the fans' sake.  The end of the film was also lacking.  The majority of the O.W.L.S. sequence at the end of the novel, especially the Astronomy part, was one of my favorite parts of the film.  The complete Ministry of Magic sequence at the end of the novel would have been another cool part to add into the movie for it would have added some more action to the lacking film.On the upside, the Dumbledore's Army scenes were stunning and perfect.  They were exactly as I imagined them and added a slight but entertaining dimension to slow film.  The fight against the Death Eaters and Voldemort at the end (while too short in length) was more amazing than I could have imagined.  If you want to see stunning ""the best"" wizards at work, then watch the Ministry of Magic sequence at the end of the film.  Speaking of the MOM, the set for it was stunning, and is one of my favorite in the entire series.In the end, I gave this film four stars out of five, just because it's Harry Potter.  This film also earned points on every front except the story.  I highly recomend it if you are interested in stunning visual effects, great music, good actors, and a fan of the Harry Potter series.  It really is a great movie, for the most part."	4.0	Really Is A Great Movie, Honestly	2008-02-25	2	1	1
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3ELCTZ225DVJZ	Mrs. Sharon L. Johnson	I will not bore you by recapping the story or the performances, since many people appear to like assuming that role.However, I would like to make two observations about this and HP4.First, as many people have noted, there is a lot of material not included in the movie. This is inevitable given the length and all the subplots that are in the book.  However, I think they really missed something important here and in HP4 by dropping the storyline about Fred and George and their preoccupation with gags and tricks, leading to their joke shop. This could have given some much needed light hearted scenes to help counterbalance the dark and evil aspects of the movies.Second, is my personal belief that in most cases excessive wealth leads people (whether they are millionaire athletes, actors, or writers) to evil ways and usually the belief that they are somehow above normal humans. The first HP books were enjoyable stories with a reasonable balance of good times and bad. The later books are entirely devoted to the dark side (even if the theme is fighting the dark side) and, as such, were not nearly as enjoyable to read.  Of couse, that did not affect the author's ability to make more millions. Unfortunately, that is just they way humans are structured.Probably few people will agree, but there you go.	3.0	The HP Series gets darker	2007-12-10	3	1	2

When Harry pulls out his wand in front of Dudley and all of his friends, I said this just would not happen, and it did not happen that way in the book. Harry know not to pull his wand infront of people like that. Harry did pull his wand on Dudley when it was just them in the book. Also, the prophecy. The point of the prophecy is that Harry & Dumbledore are supposed to be the only ones that know the full prophecy (at least until Harry tells Hermione and Ron). This is an IMPORTANT fact because no one else is supposed to know about this. ANd yet, in the movie as soon as Harry picks it up all of the friends with him hear it. I honestly am I HUGE Harry Potter fan. I have been overall very pleased with the first 4 movies. But this movie definitely left something to be desired.As a huge HP fan I would be willing to sit through a 3 hour Harry Potter movie if it really went with the book.What really upset me is that my husband hasn't read the books, but he has always enjoyed the movies a lot. So we went to watch the movie together and after an hour he said I don't really want to watch this anymore because he was lost about what was going on. And I can totally understand that! If I hadn't read the book I would have been to.I am really hoping that the last 2 movies are going to be great. The last two movies have so many important details that the movies really can't risk leaving out much.

Don't you do it, too.To all those who slag Sir Michael Gambon's Dumbledore vs Richard Harris': Get Over It! I loved Richard Harris, from THE SPORTING LIFE to the two MAN CALLED HORSE films, to his wonderful role as English Bob in UNFORGIVEN. God knows, I bought the LP A Tramp Shining when MacArthur Park was new, but Richard Harris is dead and gone, and Gambon is doing a fine job. Of course, it would be tough not to enjoy anyone in the role of Dumbledore unless they were totally inept or Dog The Bounty Hunter. Tell you what, Richard Harris can portray Albus Dumbledor in DEATHLY HALLOWS, ok?Evanna Lynch was great as Luna Lovegood, although I kept thinking of her as Moon Unit.I'd been waiting for Helena Bonham Carter to make some sort of an appearance in the series, and she didn't disappoint: her Bellatrix LeStrange was horrid(in a wonderfully ee-vill way).The transformation of Harry Melling's Dudley Dursley from spoilt & pampered boy to Yobbo was well done.As many other reviewers have harped on, the film of Order Of The Phoenix is too short, and there are some little things that annoyed me, such as an obvious cost-cutting move when Sirius Black visits Harry through the fire in Harry & Ron's room, and how could they have ignored the fact that former Gryffindore prefect Percy Weasley was now a minion of the Ministry of Magic?.I, too, miss Quidditch, but I miss Chris Columbus' direction far more.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1EOUZPGG3OFS7	Nancy M. Thompson	I was disappointed to say the least. I went in with such anticipation and then I felt kinda empty. When I read the book the last few chapters made me  cry. The movie (SPOILERS TO FOLLOW) during the scene with the curtain and Sirius there was an extreme absence of emotion. It just goes slow motion for a few moments for drama and then nothing. Now I know that movies can never touch emotions like the book since you're separated from the character's thoughts and emotions but boy they could have tried harder. The screen from the book that sticks in my mind the best is Harry's rage and heartbreak when he gets back to the school. It wasn't there. Life goes on and Harry forgets all about it. I'm interested to see how they make up for the parts they removed from the movie that are pretty darn important in the next couple of books. We all know Radcliffe has the ability to act so why won't they let him?	4.0	so close and yet...	2008-02-21	1	0	1

Rowlings 5th book was unfortunately a let down for me.  You definitely needed to have read the book first  to understand what was going on in the movie.  Favorite scenes from the book were left out - Quiddich.  Favorite characters - Hagrid, Creature and Tonks had very minimal parts.  The movie is very dark in both cinematography and subject.  The characters all have a harder edge and definitely not a children's movie.  Imelda Staunton who was cast as the perfect Delores Umbridge literally steals the whole movie.  Harry, Hermoine and Ron all seem to be getting a little too old for the characters that they play.  The best part of the movie was the last 30 minutes, unfortunately you had to sit through the first two hours to get there.	4.0	He's Back	2007-07-11	4	2	2

Tiny, intricate details (often in the distance or background) that would normally be lost in fuzzy obscurity on a DVD shine through with brilliance in this film. The film itself is wonderful, and probably the best of the bunch so far, with masterful editing going into taking such a long and complex book and condensing it into such a short film without losing too many of the important details.

As usual, the mood is darker than the previous movie, though we do have some true romance in this one.  The cast is big, as we have numerous characters from all the previous movies, with several new ones, both students and professors.  Alas this is the first movie without any Quidditch scenes, though this is more than compensated by some awesome broomstick flying thru downtown London.  And we finally have some extensive duels to the death between adult wizards and witches, with two of them forming the movie's climax.

That's where we left off when Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ended.  We're now past the midway point in the franchise.  At the time of this film's release six years had passed since the release of Sorcerer's Stone and that film feels a world away now.  Harry's world continues down its dark path that was laid down in Prisoner of Azkaban, the growing pains that emerged in Goblet of Fire continue, and now the magical world is taking on a more political feel.Harry is despondent; he's stuck again at the Dursley's (his Aunt and Uncle), cut off from his friends, and is still reeling from the death of Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) and the rise of  Voldemort at the end of the Tri-Wizard Tournament.  No one wants to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned and the Ministry of Magic (Wizard Government to all that are uninformed) and press are working hard to discredit him in the eyes of the public.  Much to Harry's dismay the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is a Ministry official that's hell bent on controlling Hogwart's and its students.  To make matter worse, Harry is experiencing strange nightmares that seem tied to the mysterious object that Voldemort is searching for.I have very mixed feelings about Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  There are several aspects of the film that I really like and there are several things about the film that annoy me considerably.  Do I like the film?  Yes.  Do I love the film?  No.  Is it a film that personifies the term ""Missed Opportunity?""  Absolutely, possibly more than any film in the entire series.  I try not to judge the Harry Potter films against the Harry Potter novels; I'm not an avid reader by any means so I always try to judge a film just as a film since that's my area of ""expertise.""  That's hard to do with this film; Order of the Phoenix is the longest Potter book but is the shortest of the first seven films.  It feels rushed, some of that has to do with the new screen writer Michael Goldenberg.  This is the only Potter film including the soon to be released Deathly Hallows Part 2 not to have Steve Kloves as its screenwriter.  He does an admirable job considering he's coming into the franchise halfway through but the film feels rushed and strangely convenient.  There's so much going on in the book, I know sacrifices have to be made to turn an 870 page book into a film of reasonable length.  With that said, I feel that too much was excised from the final product and while the movie moves along at a brisk pace I get the constant feeling that something's missing.  So much of the film is focused on just advancing the story forward that there's not a lot of opportunity to enjoy what's going because you're being hit over the head with lots of exposition.  What do I think led to this rushed feeling?  I believe that Order of the Phoenix might have fallen prey to penny pinching executives at Warner Brothers that wanted to get the maximum amount of showtimes per day by cutting this film to a paltry 2 hour 18 minutes which is quite short by Potter standards.  In addition to the new screenwriter a new director takes over as well; David Yates, who was best known as a gritty TV movie director steps into his first major theatrical film.  While I definitely wouldn't use the word ""overwhelmed"" I would say he made some rookie mistakes by imploring some lazy film making techniques namely in the form of montages.  There are two montages in the film; by comparison there are zero montages throughout the first four films.  They just don't fit into the flow of the film well and feel out of place in the series as a whole.  I can't help but think that replacing the five minutes of montages with 15-20 minutes of actual story would have benefited this film immensely.I don't want you to think that I don't like Order of the Phoenix because I do.  The film succeeds in many ways and sets up the second half of the Harry Potter saga well.  You can look at the Harry Potter films individually, in pairs (1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8), or in halves (1-4, 5-8).  If you can remember back to Sorcerer's Stone, that film had the huge task of introducing the audience to Harry's world.  The first four films dealt with the prospect of Voldemort returning.  Order of the Phoenix has a similar task to Sorcerer's Stone because it has to introduce the audience to Harry's world with Voldemort in it and the the next three films deal with that.  Order of the Phoenix introduces the audience to the politics of the Wizarding World.  Harry is not widely believed after finishing the Tri-Wizard Tournament and his fight against Voldemort and is being accused of being a liar and is being smeared in the news.  I find the political aspect of Phoenix's story to be one of its best strong points and its nice to get a larger glimpse of the world outside of Hogwarts.  Another strong point of the film is it's final forty-five minutes because it has some of the most exciting scenes of the series so far and almost makes me forget about some of the other shortcomings I mentioned earlier.  The CGI used in Order of the Phoenix continues to impress.  There's the occasional moment in the film where the CGI isn't perfect which I think comes from them over reaching what could be accomplished with computer effects in 2007.  95% of the effects are outstanding and the remaining 5% are good; there wasn't anything that made me cringe so please don't take my criticism too seriously.  While series newcomer David Yates made some mistakes in regard to pacing he does a great job creating a wonderful look for this film.  I've praised Alsonso Cuar&oacute;n and Mike Newell's direction in the past two films, I would say David Yate's would fall somewhere in between their looks.  I don't think Cuar&oacute;n's looked could be topped but Yate's does a great job and gives Order of the Phoenix a wonderful look that is both dark and haunting while still beautiful.As much as Prisoner of Azkaban was a film that changed the tone of the franchise, Order of the Phoenix changed how we perceive the cast.  The Harry Potter films at their heart have always focused on Harry, Ron, and Hermione with most of the remaining focus being on the adult characters (i.e. Dumbledore, Snape, or McGonagall) relationships with the trio.  That however changes to some degree in Order of the Phoenix; Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley, the Weasley twins, newcomer Luna Lovegood, and other students become more integral to the plot.  Most of these characters have been with the series since the beginning but now have a little more to do than just stand around.  Harry also gets his first girlfriend in the form of Cho Chang (Katie Leung) which creates a cute moment that reminds the audience that Harry isn't quite all grown up yet.  The main newcomer to the cast is Imelda Staunton (Vera Drake) as Dolores Umbridge the new Defense Against the Dark Arts and the film's secondary villain.  She's an absolute treat but is also terribly infuriating which is sort of the point of her character.  She's wears pink and wants to believe she's sweeter than sweet but she's the complete opposite.  Stephen King described her character in the book as the ""greatest make-believe villain to come along since Hannibal Lecter.""  While she doesn't eat her victims liver with fava beans and a nice butterbeer she does live up to King's praise because she's quite horrible and you really root against her.  In a smaller supporting role is Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, one of Voldemort's most loyal and dangerous Death Eaters.  I've never been a big fan of Helena (aside from Fight Club) but she plays Bellatrix, it's not a glamorous role but she embraces it and she seems properly strange and crazy.  Alan Rickman of course returns as Severus Snape and is finally given more to do than just scowl at Harry in his most important role since Azkaban.  Speaking of Azkaban; Gary Oldman and David Thewlis return which was an extremely welcome addition since they're two of my favorite characters.  Due to the plot Michael Gambon's role as Dumbledore is smaller than in past films and that loss is felt throughout the film but by the end who'll almost forget he was gone.While not the strongest entry into the Harry Potter series Order of the Phoenix isn't the weakest entry either. The new screenwriter and new director combined to make the perfect storm of film making mistakes in the form of pacing and montages that keep Order of the Phoenix from reaching is highest potential which is unfortunate because it had the makings of being one of the best film entries.  Director David Yates does a nice a job creating a very pretty yet haunting film and it does advance the story along and sets up the remaining films up nicely.  It's nice to see the younger cast taking on a larger role in the film and the two new cast additions are both effective villains.  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is sort of mixed bag but it's still a decent film that ranks somewhere in the middle of the Harry Potter pack.The Blu-rayThis is getting very infuriating; the Ultimate Edition sets come out in pairs (1-2, 3-4, 5-6) and each release has slightly different packaging than the last pair to be released.  If you remember back to my review of Prisoner of Azkaban I talked about how the UE's (Ultimate Editions) for Azkaban & Goblet were slightly taller and had a lenticular cover instead of an embossed cardboard cover.  This pissed me off since I like everything to match on my DVD racks and now the most recent UE's don't match either of the previous releases.  So what changed this time?  Instead of being three disc releases like the first four UE releases, Order of the Phoenix (and Half Blood Prince) only have two discs.  They only have two discs because unlike previous films they were released on Blu-ray and DVD at the same time and didn't have to port over the DVD extras to the Blu-ray releases so there's not as much overflow.  That means that the boxes are skinnier than the three disc UE releases and therefore don't match the previous sets in a new way.  I would have preferred them to stuff a blank piece of cardboard in the box to pad out the width of the set so that they would match the previous four sets.As I stated in the Azkaban review this isn't a deal breaker for me but it's frustrating that Warner Brothers can't stick with box design so my UE Collection would look nice and match instead of being a mismatched mess.  I can only assume that the final UE releases for Deathly Hallows Part 1 and Part 2 will differ from these sets in one way or another.  Any guesses on how they'll differ; height, width, discs, cover art?Just like previous sets you get the character cards (Luna Lovegood, Dolores Umbridge), a digital copy of the film, and the 48 page collectible book.  Continuing the trend of the past several Ultimate Editions there isn't an Extended Cut of the film.  Considering how much extra footage I've heard was shot it's disappointing not to see any new footage added back into shortest of the first seven films.  I'm going to be quite annoyed if in a year or two Warner Brothers releases this film with an extended or director's cut after not offering it here.Sizing up the video transfer for this release is quite easy, it's perfect.  I gave Goblet of Fire a 5 out of 5 video score which I feel was fair but Order of the Phoenix looks even better.  It's a stunning transfer that looks exactly like it did when I saw the film projected digitally in 2007.  Black levels are great, detail is astonishing, and colors are appropriately represented.  It's perfection in the form of a Blu-ray.Though not as outright impressive as the video the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track is also wonderful.  Order of the Phoenix may not have as many action sequences as its predecessor but it's no less impressive when given the chance.  Rumbling bass and some great directionality are present when the action picks up and in the quieter scenes you'll be impressed with the subtlety the track can provide.  No matter if it's a dementor attack, a classroom scene, or a fight to the death you'll find the dialogue crystal clear and easy to understand even at low volume levels.Disc One features a PiP track hosted by Daniel Radcliffe.  The track is quite informative and Daniel Radcliffe genuinely seems interested in presented the information to the audience.  There's a lot of good information presented in the track but there are some long gaps that could annoy anyone that's just watched the movie straight through and is now watching the film with the commentary track on.  All the major points are able to be viewed via the ""Focus Points"" feature that plays the PiP segments on their own individually or in a ""Play All"" mode.  Disc two features the Creating the World of Harry Potter Part 5: Evolution documentary.  This is a major improvement over the dull as dishwater Part 4 segment from Goblet of Fire.  This segment dives into how everything from the actors, the castle, the logo, the effects, and the franchise as a whole has evolved since the first film.  It's a fascinating segment and there are lots of before and after comparisons to be seen and it's one of my favorite segments so far.  There are 11 minutes of deleted scenes presented in HD, none are exactly mind blowing and they're the same scenes that were on the original Blu-ray release in 2007.  From what I've heard there's a lot more extra footage that still hasn't seen the light of day so it's disappointing not to see any of it presented here in this ""Ultimate"" Edition release.  Two short featurettes are also presented in HD:-Building the Magic: Behind the Sets of Harry Potter is 20 minutes long and goes in great detail on what goes into making the sets of the Harry Potter films special.-Trailing Tonks is 19 minutes long and follows actress Natalia Tena as she gives a tour of Leavesden Studio where much of the Potter films are shot.There are three SD featurettes; The Rebellion Begins, Behind the Magic, and Fullfilling a Prophecy.  I took a quick peek at them and they're OK but we all know how I feel about standard definition extras and I think most fans will get most of what they need to know from the HD special features.  Last but not least is a collection of Order of the Phoenix trailer presented in HD.Impersonating a snake... pay no attention to my arms.ConclusionI consider this film to be the biggest missed opportunity of the franchise.  It's not a bad film, it just never reaches the level of greatness that I think it could have reached.  It's still better than the first two Potter films and this release has flawless video and audio presentations.  I'm still pretty upset by the continuing packaging changes but the Creating the World of Harry Potter documentary is one of the series best so far so those almost balance each other out.  If you just want to pick up the film you can purchase the single disc release that has almost identical video & audio and many of the special features (excluding the documentary) for about $10."	4.0	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Ultimate Blu-ray Edition	2012-02-21	1	0	1

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A8Y520XGRYSY7	NineseveN	As a mostly macho male who's been converted to the world that is the Harry Potter films, I entered into the first movie with a bit of reluctance (and only did so at the behest of my better half). Much to my surprise, I was completely entertained and rather surprised as to how much I liked the first film. Since I'd bought her the entire series up to that point (films 1-4), I decided to give The Chamber of Secrets a chance as well. Again, I was pleasantly entertained and found myself actually caring about the story. So on I went, taking in the third and subsequent fourth film in the series to date and at the end, I was eager to see what happened next, which is the mark of any solid film series.And what happened next was a very surprising, yet welcome turn. Things in the Harry Potter universe got serious. Yes, the death of Cedric and the locked wand scene with Voldemort from The Goblet of Fire were serious, but those moments also purposefully lacked the level of gravity that we're greeted with right up front with the Order of the Phoenix. Up until this installment in the franchise, Harry Potter is portrayed as a child with grown-up problems; an individual that's unfairly tossed into a world he doesn't fully understand and into a conflict that he wants no part of, save for the temptation of vengeance for his slain parents. When Professor Umbridge puts the kibosh on magic, Hermione senses what needs to be done, but she also realizes that she needs Harry to pull it off. This is where Harry turns into a man. He sees the conflict beyond his struggle with Voldemort, he accepts that this battle and those that will come are about more than his vendetta against the dark lord; it's about the world of magic and the people within it. Harry confronts the problems he and his peers face and begins to climb over the obstacles and front of him, leading others in the process (albeit a little reluctantly at first).But there's also the larger point, which I'm not sure Rowling intended to make, or at least didn't intentionally craft it to parallel some of the current societal topics such a rights relating to self defense and the bearing of arms, which are almost completely absent in the UK. One of the points that is driven home throughout the second half of film is that sometimes things that are dangerous are best left in the hands of the just, otherwise the just will be defenseless against the unjust, who will not abide by any rules prohibiting dangerous things or nefarious conduct. The Ministry of Magic, through Umbridge, pulls of a complete parallel to an overbearing nanny-state government the removes objectionable things from the hands of the good in order to try and hold back the tides of evil (in this case by taking the teaching and use of magic away from the student body). Of course, as often happens in real life, this is a total failure, the only thing Umbridge and the Ministry end up accomplishing is leaving the children naked and vulnerable to the real evil in the world; one they flat out refuse to see in Voldemort's return.As someone who won't read the books until I've seen all of the films, I can't say that I was disappointed by what was left out of the movie, as I have no idea what I am missing. While the overall story of the film does seem dead in spots where mostly benign but key pieces of information or character development appear to be missing, and though overall the film seemed a bit rushed and crammed together, it's still an entertaining ride and left me wanting more, which again is the mark of any great film series. The final battle scene, which is wonderfully done and occurs as the most impressive, powerful and unique display of magic to date, left me with a sense that this was a transitional film for Harry Potter, that the next time we meet him, the boy who's been the subject of rumors, whispers, prophecies and legend will be coming into his own and wielding that great power that everyone has spoken of since the first film.	4.0	The boy wizard becomes a man	2009-08-07	0	0	0

Indeed, if you watch this movie without having read the book, you will probably not follow exactly what is happening. If this matters to you, I suggest you skip this movie altogether.On the other hand, if you like a movie to be full of spectacular special effects and don't care much about what the story is - or whether there is one - then you will love this movie. Buy it right away, if you haven't already.This explains why some reviewers think it's the best HP movie and others think it's the worst. It all depends on what you want.

But the fifth book in the Hp series, while good, did have a lot of annoying things happening.  The main one being Harry being such a snot to his friends.  I know the reasoning, but the angry teenager just rubbed me the wrong way.  I like that his isolation and his frustration was there but didn't drag across the entire film.  Ron and Hermoine are getting less and less screen time, but that's fine, too.  Especially since Daniel seems to be the only one willing to improve his acting chops.  Really, it was almost too painful to watch Emma Watson wooden performance.  Draco Malfoy was another character who's part was noticable absent.  But as a film, unless I want to spend the entire day planted in a theater seat, things have to be cut.  Adaptations are all dwindled down and one shouldn't be running to see movie five without having read the series anyway, so you know the details.  For the money and the entertainment value, I think this was the best movie to date.  Highly recommended.	5.0	I loved the movie more than the book	2007-07-17	5	1	4

Although the 3D IMAX version cannot be beat (I saw it twice), the DVD is excellent too.  I consider the DVD an indispensable addition to my Harry Potter collection.  Of course, some material from the book was thoughtfully deleted.  If you want a movie to include every detail from the book, an 8-hour long movie such as the uncut version of Greed will probably be more to your liking.  I was not over impressed with the extra material in the Two Disk Special Edition.  In my opinion, the deleted clips demonstrated that the editor knew what he or she was doing.	5.0	Best Harry Potter Film Yet!	2008-01-12	0	0	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1I182X374TVVL	oldkawman	I hope eventually a directors cut or extended cut will be released on DVD. There were several disconnects or discontinuities in the story. The biggest being where Umbrige catches Harry, Hermione, and Ron in her office. Then the office is full of Neville, Luna,and Ginny. They must have just happened buy? The whole scene leading up to this was obviously cut out. My son (13) and daughter (12) even caught that one. Several other places the story only makes sense if you read the book. My kids biggest comment on the movie was that many things did not make sense, too hard to follow, too many missing parts. This was my favorite of the first 6 books. Looks like 2 of the 5 stars of the movie is laying on the cutting room floor. It's one thing to have a movie that is too long and another to have one that does not follow due to omissions.	3.0	Too much lost on the cutting room floor	2007-07-16	7	5	2

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A30LMTLC9XVWKJ	Only-A-Child	"Normally I don't wait several years to comment on a recent film,  simply because it is unlikely that many will read my comment.  But the comments and reviews for ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" (2007) are generally so off-the-mark that a few supplemental comments could be of value.  And hopefully my comments gain useful perspective from the distance of a few years since the release.As has already been said this chapter of the story is a relatively small-scale one.  The Ministry of Magic is worried that Hogwarts presents a security risk, and so it plants a mole (Dolores Umbridge - slickly played by Imelda Staunton) to discredit Dumbledore and to prevent him from training students to defend themselves against the dark arts.  The Ministry is in denial about the return of ""he who must not be named""  (i.e. Lord Voldemort is back and preparing for an attack).Personally ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is my favorite of all the films up to now.  I have a lot of reasons.  For one, while the three principle actors by 2007 had begun to look a bit too old for their characters (Rupert Grint especially so),  the disparity is not so great that a lot of energy must be expended suspending disbelief;  as is the case with the later films.  And Daniel Radcliffe uses his maturity as a actor to bring a sophisticated internal life to Harry; something he could not quite manage in the earlier films.  Another reason is that it represents the midway point of the overall story and therefore strikes the best balance between serious elements and elements of whimsy.  And things stay fresh with the introduction of new characters like Umbridge and Bellatrix Lestrange (Helen Bonham Carter) who fit the film's dark/light balance by being evil characters who are amusingly overplayed.But I suspect that the biggest reason I favor this particular film is that it does not flinch from the book's theme of existential despair.  And they economically pull this off through the inspired casting of Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood, my all-time favorite Potter character.  Harry suffers a lot inside, which is one of the things that makes him different from the other students at Hogwarts, most of whom tend to avoid him.  And he in turn tends to isolate himself, even from his close friends Ron and Hermione.  The film version of Luna is the only friend who really gets Harry and he is energized by their interactions.  And she has the most profound line of the whole franchise:  ""The things we lose have a way of coming back to us, even if it is not always in a way that we expect"".Rowling and others have pointed out that Luna is Hermione's alter ego; an illogical and impulsive counterpart to Hermione's analytical realist. Both process more information than their fellow students, but Hermione has filters to define and dispense with the information.  Luna is less judgmental, for her processing is experiencing.While these comparisons help define Herminone, Luna herself is important because of her similarity to Harry. The subtle similarities regularly amaze him and they allow her to repeatedly demonstrate to him that he is not alone.  She is his bridge to everyone else in a story where he must subordinate his desire to go it alone if he hopes to successfully engage the forces of the Dark Lord. The film was especially focused on illustrating this special quality of their relationship.Overall, what has most amazed me about the whole Harry Potter series is the evidence that Rowling had the entire story pretty much outlined in detail at the beginning and engaged in considerable foreshadowing; something you do not appreciate with the first reading of each book.  The ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" adaptation provides an interesting example of how this foreshadowing can be done visually.  Ginny Weasley is destined to become Harry's love interest but up until this point it has been mostly a little sister / big brother type relationship (Bonnie Wright was only 10 when featured in ""Chamber of Secrets"").  In ""Order of the Phoenix""  Harry is still preoccupied with Cho Chang (Katie Leung who looks considerably older than Wright).  What to watch for are the scenes in which the Harry - Cho relationship progresses; each time the editor goes out on a static shot of a grim Ginny observing their interaction.I am quite happy with the two-disc special edition DVD, since it did not promise to include an extended version of the film and the current $2 price for a used copy is quite affordable.  The second disc includes a number of special features.  ""Trailing Tonks"", a tour of the film sets hosted by offbeat Natalia Tena is especially good.  There are also a number of humorous deleted scenes of Emma Thompson portraying Professor TrelawneyThen again, what do I know?  I'm only a child."	5.0	My Favorite of the Franchise	2011-05-28	2	0	2

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2PDPPIQ3SZ29V	"Pamela Correa ""peanut gallery"""	"Disc 1 - the movie.I gave the movie only 3 stars.  I am a fan of the books, so it was inevitable that I was disappointed with the movie, but not for the reasons you might think.  Much was cut out, but that isn't what bothered me.  As the longest book in the series, it was a given that many things would be cut.  My main gripe is that the 5th movie installment didn't stay true to the story.  The other four movies managed to do that, despite all the subplots, etc that were left out.First and foremost, this book is ALL about Harry's emotions; his frustration, his anger.  He is at the breaking point after years of being loved one minute and hated the next.  In the beginning, he is furious with Ron and Hermione, throughout the book he constantly battles with Umbridge, and at the end he explodes in Dumbledore's office.He lands himself in detention with Umbridge several times because he just can't control his temper.  He struggles throughout the book with Dumbledore's apparent lack of caring.  He is worried about Sirius being locked up in Grimmauld Place, and he hates Snape for constantly antagonizing Sirius.  Harry begins to alienate himself from eveyone after the attack on Arthur Weasley because he think Voldemort might be possessing him.  None of this was portrayed adequately in the film, not to mention that he is both tormented and enthralled by the reoccuring dreams of the door to the department of mysteries.  All of these things lead up to Harry's explosion of rage in Dumbledore's office at the end.  It was not a quiet conversation.  Harry screams, yells, and smashes up the office.  He loses complete control and all his emotions come spilling out.  After which, Dumbledore proceeds to explain to Harry that it is all his fault, that he has known of the prophecy all along and that he should have told Harry sooner than he did.  He tells him that he was trying to protect him because he had come to care for Harry so much.  The true essence of that scene was lost in the film.It just seems that directors are caving in to special effects and movie theatrics and losing sight of what the story is all about.*On the plus side, I did think Umbridge was very well cast and I thought the possession scene with Harry was really great!  There were a few good moments in the film.*Disc 2 - special features.  I don't know what else to say except that they sucked!  The deleted scenes were nothing, just 20 second fillers.  I had hoped that there would be some really great scenes in there that they just didn't have time for.  The Tailing Tonks segment was terrible, didn't really show any of the behind the scenes operations in depth enough to give us any idea of how the movie was made.  There were no cast interviews, no explanation of script writing/changes - nothing.  It just seemed as though they had forgotten about the special features, so at the last minute they just threw a bunch of leftover stuff together.  It's my advice to not bother with the 2 disc special edition and just buy the movie itself.  It was a complete disappointment for those like me that love to watch ""the making of..."" featurettes."	3.0	OK movie, disappointing special features	2007-12-27	1	1	0

There are a couple of things they could have added to the movie to make it flow a little better, but I know time is a consideration.  I have read the books, so it is hard sometimes to not wish some details were added to the movie to keep it in line with the books.  The actors played the characters brilliantly and you can't come away from it without having strong feelings about the characters.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	ARMVAHWQQ9S8A	"Pat Shand ""Pat Shand"""	"From the opening sequence, I knew that this would be the best movie of the series. And it is. By far.From the outstandingly ballsy cinematography to the acting (it's like night and day between this movie and ""Goblet of Fire"", which was great in it's own right but can't touch this), from the witty and quirky script to the special effects, it's clear that director David Yates single handedly whipped the Harry Potter movie franchise into shape. While movies 1-4 were great, they were like unpolished stones; at points they tried so hard to go along with the books and at others tried so hard to separate themselves from the books (think ""Prisoner of Azkaban""'s shrunken heads), but this movie--""Order of the Phoenix""--knows what it is. It is a film, and it makes sense as a film. Everything you need to know to understand the film is here, and--unlike ""Goblet of Fire""--you won't need a previous understanding of the books or even the other movies. Certainly fans will complain about deviance from the book, but these are the same unreasonable people that wish the movies would be twenty-four hours long so they could squeeze in every line of dialogue. ""Order of the Phoenix"" is how a book should be adapted.Every actor, from Daniel Radcliffe to Emma Watson to the kid who plays Dudley, is at the tippy top of their game. They're playing young adults and they act it; they laugh, and they cry. This is the first time that I actually totally suspended my disbelief while watching a Potter film, and that was almost all due to the superb acting.I did expect a bit more from the climax (the important character death was kind of wiggy) but things get roaring back into shape for a perfect duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort. Following that, everything touched on in the movie wraps up beautifully. No threads are left untied, and no plot left with an open end. Very, very satisfying. Oh, and if that isn't enough, this should be: Evanna Lynch is spine-tinglingly good as Luna Lovegood.It may not be what you expected, it may not be what you thought you wanted...

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A25XGZX0YRTJKN	Paul J. Moade	"I'll open Pandora's box on this and risk the raves of outraged fans.Anyway ....There are those of us who have not read all of the books in the set and therefore depend on the film to convey what is going on in Harry Potter's world. While I enjoyed the movie for it's whimsical content and some very well done scenes/characterizations, I find this particular installment to be rather diffuse and confusing (no, I have not read the book - didn't realize that was a prerequisite).Scenes just kinda pop up with no real rhyme or reason as to why they are there. I am sure the written work explains everything, but the movie should stand-alone and not rely on its audience having read the author's work. I can understand the need to cut from a book to preclude a film that might easily be over four hours long, but then the cuts have to be very selective and intelligently done.Couple examples: Why the opening scenes with Dudley and why are the dementors attacking Harry? Were they sent by the Ministry? By Voldemort? Why is the Ministry taking extremes in this case with Harry using magic outside of school? He has done so before with the Ministry just shrugging their shoulders (""The Ministry of Magic does not send one to Azkaban for blowing up their Aunt"", from Prisoner).Why is Minister Fudge concerned with Dumbledore vying for his job? Nothing was hinted at this in earlier films, nor was it addressed in the beginning of this film. Why would the Minister deny the return of Voldemort as a tool to use against Dumbledore? This makes no sense for a politician and turns out to work against him. Seems like the Minister Fudge has suddenly taken a dislike to Harry and those who support him. Was this V's work?More development was needed on Prof. Snape's encounters with Harry's father while a student himself. While explaining some of Snape's attitude towards Harry in earlier films, it is too shallow. Ditto for L. Malfoy's encounter with Harry in the Hall of Mysteries. We learned in Goblet that he was a Death Eater and follower of Voldemort, but too little was detailed on his role here.And the list goes on. Certainly more film time could have been allocated for this movie to make it more coherent. After all, this is not a test of the market place. Harry Potter films have proven themselves (Phoenix grossed 44.2 million on its opening day in the US) and a larger investment (by the producer) will certainly be returned as the film is released. I felt like I was watching the `Cliff Notes' version of the story when I viewed this episode.Character studies, which have always been a strong point in the series, were mostly lacking here. A notable exception was Delores Umbridge who was deliciously detestable and sufficiently developed to give a `feel' for the character.Madeye Moody, Lupus and others had cameo appearances. Would have loved to see why they were there. All were part of the original Order of the Phoenix, but again, this was not explained but briefly. Harry Potter's group of students was called ""Dumbledore's Army"" and not ""Order of the Phoenix"" so why the title of the film?I have always enjoyed openings with the Dursley's. They set the theme of a social outcast for Harry, hence his strong ties to Hogwarts and the world of magic where he is not only accepted but acclaimed. These have always had some development or pertinance to the main story, though.In ""Sorcerer's Stone"" we are introduced to Harry's adopted family and shown how he is treated. It is a lead-in to the rest of the film and is well done. In ""Chamber"" we see progress. Although still badly treated, Harry is moved from the cupboard to Dudley's spare bedroom. And while it is not plainly stated, Vernon and company now have a grudging respect/fear of Harry's abilities and friends. In ""Prisoner"" the Dursley family is extended to include a visit from the Aunt -- who turns out to be every bit as petty and hateful as the base family. A bit of comic relief when Harry becomes annoyed with her and 'blows her up'. We can also see the fear Vernan and Petunia have of Harry (Dudley is too stupid and just keeps eating in front of the television) as Marge insults Harry's mother and father, and the lights begin to flicker/wind blow. They know something is coming. Here, Harry has also had enough and moves out of the house in a snit.""Goblet"" has no sequence with the Dursley's, so we assume that Harry has moved in with his Godfather, Sirius. (Hadn't read the book so I don't know if the Dursleys are there or not).In ""Phoenix"", Harry is back with the Dursleys. We don't know why. Interaction between Harry and the family is minimal other than Harry's rescue of Dudley and Uncle Vernan's gleeful announcement of 'Justice' when the message arrives from the Ministry about Harry's expulsion from school. This scene really needed more development in 'Phoenix'. It's like the director put it in just to move us to the scenes at the Ministry of Magic.Short of it all is that this installment was a disappointment to me in that I do not feel it measures up to the previous chapters. Too much was cut from the novel. This seems to have disappointed those who read the book, and for those of us who did not, it left us in the dark about a lot of events and scenes. And while some editing is necessary to keep the film from being too long, the cut sequences should not detract from the pace of the movie or introduce ambiguity. In OOTP they do exactly that.Yes, I would recommend this film as part of the ongoing saga, but not as a stand-alone. For someone just getting started with the Potter series, this is not the one to see.Luke-warm addition to an otherwise outstanding series.Grudgingly Recommended.~P~"	3.0	Weakest HP film of the five released thus far	2007-12-29	5	2	3

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3C1N5QS5I0XFE	Peter T. Kupfer	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was a good addition to the Harry Potter film library. I have a hard time watching the films after reading the book because I prefer a literal interpretation, but I suppose the books are little too long for that. The first movie was pretty literal, but it was also pretty short. The first part of the movie really seems to jump around. The screenwriter seems to have chosen random samples from the book to show. When they do show a scene from the book they are fairly literal but they make some often frustrating choices of what to cut and what to add that is not in the book.An example of this is when Harry and the advance guard fly from Privot Drive to headquarters. They fly close to the river's surface and almost hit and boat (meaning muggles would like see them) whereas in the book, Moody is adamant about flying high so as not to be seen. Also, when the students get off the train they are not in their robes whereas in the book it always a staple of the end of the train ride to put on their robes. Also, the statue in the Ministry of Magic didn't seem to match the description in the book with just one fountain in the middle. I think it had the same statues, but this seems like a simple touch that a set designer or film director would be able to correct. It was almost like the screenwriter didn't read the whole book series and only skimmed the 5th book.There are other examples of this idea, but these are some that stuck with me now. The movie spends a lot of time at the DA meetings which is fun and the film does a good job of showing Harry grow up and into his role as a leader. As I said, I found the rest of the time at Hogwart's jumpy and rushed. I get the feeling, as I did with the third and fourth movie, that if you hadn't read he book you wouldn't be able to follow the story. Maybe that is okay though given the audience.Hands down the best part of the movie is the time in the Department of Ministries. The sets are well done and the action is really exciting and captures the adventure of the novel. It is faced paced, gripping, and good ride. The final battle in the Ministry of Magic between Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Harry is very exciting, and in this case the few lines Harry adds I liked and I think illustrates why being good is better than being bad. Dumbledore's speech at the end leave a lot to be desired, but I guess they were trying to keep to a schedule.Acting wise, Alan Rickman (Snape), Jason Issacs (Lucious Malfoy), and Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort) all gave stellar performances as usually. You really want to loathe Malfoy in the film and he is very convincing in the DoM. Snape is detestable and lovable at the same time especially when he is challenging Harry during occlumency. Voldemort is very calm and confident and you really fear him throughout the movie. Helena Bonham Carter does a quality job as Bellatrix Lestrange portraying a truly horrible witch. Finally, even though you hate her, Imelda Staunton gives a true to the book performance portraying Dolores Umbridge.The score in the movie is very moving. The music during at the end of the battle with Voldemort is really puts a point on the moment and truly makes you feel Harry's pain.In end, if you like Harry Potter you should see this movies. It diverts from the book a lot, but if you know the story, you will have not trouble following it. There are several excellent performances given in the film and the movie making elements are all very well done.	4.0	Good complement to the novel	2007-07-11	4	4	0

Is it worth to buy the 2-disc collector's edition? Were there any extra features included that I really wouldn't want to miss?

The music was good as well.What I didn't like; the beginning...the entire part up until they get inside the order's house was just horrible, the dementors looked silly, the acting was bad, the camera shots, everything.

It has a better and more interesting storyline. It introduces new characters such as Luna Lovegood and Bellatrix LeStrange (two very interesting female characters) The Ministry of Magic is in denial that Voldemort is back, and turns against Harry and Dumbledore. They appoint Dolores Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher; a senior Ministry official who refuses to teach practical magic. She eventually takes control of the school, which causes Harry, Ron, and Hermione to start a rebellion against her and teach their friends how to defend themselves against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Harry and Voldemort will come face-to-face again when he is looking for a prophecy to kill Harry.

However I did NOT LIKE THE DVD.The second disc is RIDICULOUS. It has four features, and editing process which is engaging for a few minutes, and then a documentary about Harry's fate that I did enjoy even though I'd seen it many times before the premiere of the 7th book. Then there was ""Tailing Tonks""It was AWFUL! I can only say it was rushed and ridiculous overview where she was turned away in minutes by ever department. You could tell David Yates and the Harry Potter Production did NOT want to spend time on this DVD. There were no engaging behind the scene views, it was discouraging!

It's the same thing you've come to expect from the series, although I think the fourth installment was terrible for many reasons (poor pacing, melodrama, little character consistency, etc). At this point, if you've been enjoying the series, this must be added to your collection. If not, you won't start liking Harry at this point.The special features are fun for kids. Of course they have games, and CD-Rom extras, but if you're a behind-the-scenes-person, like me, then it's underwhelming.	4.0	The Same Old	2008-04-21	0	0	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2TP6NFFEAN5DL	Rachel M.	This was an overall disappointment and waste of $10 bucks to see. The acting remains superb (excellent casting!), but terrible writing and attention to detail. I did like that Hogwarts was depicted as a more realistic school, however in the previous HP movies, the camera angles and screenshots were taken at a wider frame, leaving room for the eye to adjust, absorb, and enjoy all of the detailing. This movie was filmed with more close-ups of everything, not just the main characters, and it has the feeling of a Hollywood action film instead of the magical experience we're used to. Several sets were different - the Dursley's definitely had a different house in the previous films. It's a darker novel to adapt to screen, but certain details should never have been altered.I hate to spoil it for those who haven't read it, but: SPOILER ALERT.Mrs. Figg is way too calm when she finds Harry - she is raging in the book over Mundungus having left while he was supposed to be on duty. Umbridge NEVER breaks into the Room of Requirement and Cho Chang does not tell on the D.A., her friend does. Cho is supposed to be more weepy and they entirely skip over her jealousy at suspecting Harry to be involved with Hermione. The detail on Fred and George's retaliation at Hogwarts is more long-lasting, with the entire school rebelling instead of them merely applauding their fireworks (where did the pesky swamp go?). Also, Umbridge never gives the D.A. detention and she does not oversee their OWL exams. In the Department of Mysteries, the D.A. gang are left to their own devices until the bitter end before the Order shows up. In this film, they are reduced to defenseless children, having only managed to stun a few, instead of leaving several Death Eaters on the ground as is told in the book. They were definitely more empowered. Also, they weren't in the Hall of Prophecies from the beginning. Harry NEVER even heard the prophecy and Lucius Malfoy certainly did not drop it because he never held it in his hands. After the prophecy falls, Voldemort freaks out, but it's never mentioned again in the film. The battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort was shown incorrectly (for instance, where were the moving statues that held Harry back?) and when Harry was possessed, he did not go into that whole shpeal about feeling sorry for Voldemort. He passed out. And the talk between Harry and Dumbledore in the headmaster's office...where was Harry's anger? In the book, he's literally destroying Dumbledore's belongings - in this...nothing, just bitterness and grief.I know that many events and details have to be edited out for the film (the St. Mungo scenes were appropriately left out and Neville's history was adequately explained), but I think that Ron should have had his Quidditch spotlight and that the Ministry of Magic scenes at the end should have at least been correctly executed if anything. J.K. Rowling provides more detail than the average author - there is plenty of material there without having to make anything up and the common belief that the original book is better than any film adaptation holds true - her version is much more entertaining, while still retaining the raw emotions of Harry, and the oppressive atmosphere of such dismal times.A friend told me that anyone who hasn't read the book would have no inkling of what's really going on. He was right. This movie felt like the edited version of the true one that should have been filmed. I own the previous four and look forward to the final two, but I will not be purchasing this one on DVD. It would be an eyesore and I would never watch it again. A detrimental waste to J.K. Rowling's series and to its film-version predecessors.	2.0	amazing book, horrible movie! SPOILER warning	2007-07-28	18	10	8

I liked 1, 2, and 4.  I thought too much license was taken in 3, but it was still a good movie, even if it didn't follow the book very well.  However, HP and the Order of the Phoenix is completely forgettable.  While waiting for the DVD to be released, I realized I could barely remember the movie.  I wrote it off to age, but after viewing the DVD, I realize it was like watching a bad dream.The entire movie is a disjointed jumble of unexplained images of Harry being confused and angry.  There is no story development whatsoever.  How this movie could lead into Half Blood Prince is beyond my reckoning.  Everything that is going to happen in 6 is based on what was cut from 5.  This is the WORST adaptation of the series ever.There was so much missing that what was left didn't make sense.  Harry arrives at Grimmaud place and is angry at his friends for not writing.  Why, we never find out.  It was well explained in the book, but in the movie, we just show the anger.  We don't even learn that Grimmaud place is unplottable, we just get a quick cgi of the building stretching.We see Kreacher, but learn nothing of what or why.  Kreacher is pivotal to this story, but gets 15 seconds of the movie, if that.  Weasleys Wizard Wheezes is written totally out of the story and has been since Goblet of Fire.I could go on, but I think the title says it all, this is a totally disjointed and forgettable movie.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AFJFXN42RZ3G2	"R. DelParto ""Rose2"""	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the darkest Potter film to date.  Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his fellow Hogwarts students continue to fight evil as well as hone their skills as wizards.  In his unrelenting attempt to avenge the death of his parents by the demonic Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) who appears in and out of the film, Harry never gives up his untiring efforts.  For the premise of this film, Hogwarts's leadership is under scrutiny that involves accusations against Harry and Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) and one of the new characters, Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), the annoying and sinister teacher who is after the coveted title as headmaster.The film is extremely long.  But as with the other four Potter films, the cinematography and special effects are exceptional.  The pyrotechnics are loud and shattering, especially the concluding scenes where Dumbledore battles it out with Voldemort, which resonates duel-like scenes from very well known sci-fi film, such as Return of the Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.Thus far, the storyline is complex and intense as the characters battle good and evil.  And another interesting observation is how Harry and his friends continue to grow before our eyes. Yet again, Harry experiences one of his first pubescent encounters with his ongoing romance with Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and the two share an unavoidable intimate kiss under the mistletoe, which he describes somewhat immaturely to Hermoine (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) as very wet; we also see the ever so delicate and sensitive Neville (Matthew Lewis) slowly mature with confidence.Harry and the Order of the Phoenix has fantasy and adventure that many Potter fans have grown accustomed to.  As the characters and film content matures, this particular film may appeal to older children and adults.  Otherwise, the Potter films never ceases to amaze.	4.0	The Magic and Amazement Continues	2007-08-05	6	6	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3W13VVBRY5GL7	"Review Lover ""ReviewLover"""	"""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" - the movie version - IS missing lots of content from its book counterpart. Also, the screenplay has wrought a lot of big changes on the book's content and chronology. If you're a book-to-film conversion purist, or a HP Book fanatic, this fact, before anything else, might well keep you from enjoying the movie to the full. That said, if you can go into this one with an open mind (and I had to force myself to do just that, HP Book fanatic that I am), you might find yourself enjoying this movie version of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" for what it is - a fast-paced, well-made, beautiful-looking ride through Harry & co's fifth year at Hogwarts.The good: Acting-wise Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint keep improving, and this movie is no exception, they're very, very good in their roles. Michael Gambon is still an excellent Dumbledore and Alan RIckman's Snape is absolutely brilliant during the Occlumency scenes. It's nice to see the Dursleys back again at the start of the movie, and Harry Melling is excellent - loathsome and bullying - in his short turn as Dudley. Katie Leung is a great Cho - certainly we'll see more of her as an actress once the HP series is finished - and the rest of the cast, the heavyweights like Dame Maggie Smith, Gary Oldman, Julie Walters, David Thewlis and so forth - don't really get enough screen time to show off, but are perfectly plausible all the same.The newcomers are fantastic, too - Evanna Lynch makes for a great, believable Luna Lovegood and Helena Bonham-Carter's rendition of Bellatrix Lestrange is absolutely brilliant (let's hope she gets more screen-time in the ""Half Blood Prince"" adaptation!).But it's Imelda Staunton as Delores Umbridge who absolutely steals the show - she's brilliant. Turning on a dime from saccharine-sweet condescension to malevolent power-hungry bully, I can't imagine J.K. Rowling's original character being brought more wholly and satisfyingly to life. Okay, she may not look as much like a Toad as the book's character, but in the face of Staunton's excellent performance and faithful characterisation, that becomes immaterial. She's the best element of what must be the strongest set of performances in a HP movie to date.Direction by David Yates is superlative - this is a suitably adult-looking movie to reflect the changes in the HP characters' personalities and situations - and from the tense and frightening opening scenes, to the breathtaking and exciting close, Yates' talent and apparent love of this story is very palpable. Harry's ""dream"" sequences when Voldemort is invading his mind are brilliant - lovely to watch and very interesting from an artistic point of view - and the special effects, particularly during the closing scenes, are indescribably good.Production design by Stuart Craig is the absolute best in a HP movie since the original, and every element of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", Umbridge's non-toadishness notwithstanding, is nigh-on perfect. The initial scenes at the Ministry for Magic made me sit up and go ""wow!"", the death eaters and dementors are more menacing than before, there's one panoramic shot of Azkaban that makes that place absolutely terrifying in its believability. No. 12 Grimmauld Place doesn't get enough air time but what's there is gold, and the character of Grawp is a lot more human and fitting than I had imagined him from the book.The bad elements of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" all stem from the fact that this film's running time really is too short to capture every great aspect of the original novel, and the missing scenes will, for fans of the book, cause some distress. Also, the Malfoy-Crabbe-Goyle trinity isn't particularly worthwhile or believable, and there are a couple of montage scenes, particularly involving the Educational Decrees and Argus Filch, that feel too comic, too flimsy, to belong properly to the movie. Also, there are some overconvenient events (such as Cho and the Veritaserum, and Arthur Weasley's recovery) that could have used some rewriting to get them up to par with the rest of the screenplay.But that said, as a movie in its own right, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is across-the-board the most satisfying HP movie to date. Best performances, outstanding direction, excellent effects and some spectacular set and costume design have restored my faith in this series, and I for one left the cinema with a big grin on my face. Definitely a must-see for fans: newcomers; watch the others before this one - it's vital to understand what's going on. As a short adaptation of a VERY long book it works on many levels, as an entry to the movie series it's outstanding, and as a film in its own right, it's a thrilling, well-made fantasy tale that will certainly satisfy you if you don't mind the cuts.Highly ecommended!!"	4.0	Outstanding, best HP movie to date.	2007-07-14	107	82	25

Alright, let me say first that I agree completely that this movie (and the 4 that proceed it) is nothing like the book. Lots of things got left out, and sure, that disappointed me to lose the 'Weasley is our King' bit of the story. But let's face it, movies are not books. One cannot take a book and make it into a movie verbatim from the book; the movie would never end. Anyone ever read 2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke? Probably not. But I can guess that a lot of people saw that movie. Let me put it this way: the book was twice as long as the movie, and that movie felt like a funeral procession. The book was well written, and a bestseller if I'm not mistaken, but what the movie writers did was make a movie that left NOTHING out of the book, and therefore created a movie that caught the attention of many, but kept the attention of few.Now, suppose for a second that you separate the HP book series from the movie series. Take them as two separate entities. The book series flows greatly alone, and the movies do just as well alone. When you start comparing the two, you open up a world of dissatisfaction that will never be quelled. Think of the books as merely a point of reference for the movies. Realistically, those who rant about the missing factors in book to movie translations probably also rant about movie to book translations, where things are added to create more character development. I know plenty of people who enjoy the Harry Potter movies, and hate the books, as well as those who love the books and hate the movies.In and of itself, The Order of the Phoenix was well shot, cast, and directed. It has a dynamic story, and I still wanted to cry when our beloved Sirius died. Do yourself a favor, pretend you don't know anything about the story when you start watching these films, and we'll have a few less complaints on Amazon.	5.0	Calm down for just one second.	2008-01-21	1	0	1

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3K75W4XZEC5RW	Richard	"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix begins on Privet Drive when Harry and his muggle cousin Dudley are attacked by a pair of dementors trying to eat their souls. Harry fends them off with a patronus charm, but is held on trial for illegal magic. This pretty much sets the tone for the movie, which means a pretty crappy year for Harry and his friends. He gets off and returns to Hogwarts, only to find that their new teacher, Dolores Umbridge, is a ministry toady, Hagrid is gone, and everybody outside his circle of friends thinks he's crazy.I found this movie to be the best of the series since Chris Columbus left the director's chair. Compared to the last two, there are especially few ""WTF"" moments. The new characters, Luna Lovegood and Prof. Umbridge, filled their roles excellently. The special effects and set design were implemented well. The little details really make the movie. The two disc special edition has a lot of fun extras, including a tour of the set with Natalia Tena (Tonks).Although I enjoyed the movie, I feel like it was squeezed down with the fewest possible essential plot points. The spotlight is on Harry for most of the movie, with other characters having their essential developing moments grossly simplified or cut all together. It even seems like Ron and Hermione get hardly any lines at all. My personal favorite part in the book, the battle at the Department of Mysteries, was probably abbreviated the worst. The scene changes from Hogwarts to the Hall of Prophecy before you can say ""What happened to the Department of Mysteries?"".I was torn on what score to give this movie. It's much better than the last two and probably almost as good as it could be, considering how long the book is.

Granted that it just isn't possible to get everything from a 700-800 page novel in a two hour movie, but this one seemed to be missing much of what made J.K. Rowling's books so irresistible to her legions of readers.  For one thing I'm afraid that Daniel Radcliffe has aged out of his role as Harry.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1LE79HKL5G9C6	Rob6965	"If one thing will be remembered about the Harry Potter film series, it is that the films accurately portray maturity and age. As the beloved characters get older, the films get darker. Unfortunately, maturity is not always a good thing, and Harry Potter fans will wonder what happened to the whimsical, nonchalant days of old, when magic was the focus. Here, the plot is too confusing, and the characters less enjoyable than the previous films. Still, it is rather interesting to observe Harry put all that magical training into action.Order of the Phoenix puts Harry at odds with the Ministry of Magic, as shown in an early scene when Harry and his cousin Dudley are attacked by Dementors in their town. Harry uses the Patronus Charm to get rid of them, and so must face a full criminal hearing to determine whether or not he will be expelled from Hogwarts. When Harry tries unsuccessfully to convince the Ministry of the Dementors, Dumbledore comes to his aid, the first of many times Harry and Dumbledore will face off against Cornelius Fudge and the Ministry.In this film, Lord Voldemort finally becomes a full-fledged villain, haunting Harry in his dreams and gathering armies to his command. This, of course, does not bode well for the rest of the series, as the dark tone established in OOTP will inevitably continue.To the plot: Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), after witnessing the return of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), finds that he has become a ""persona non grata"" in the Wizarding world. The Ministry has convinced the citizens that he and Dumbledore are scheming to overthrow the Ministry, and that Voldemort is not back. Meanwhile, the deliciously evil Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) is tormenting Harry at school as the High Inquisitor, the representative of the Ministry's interference at Hogwarts.Harry, Hermione (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) have all the same characteristics as their counterparts in the previous films, but something seems to have been lost along the way. No longer do we get to enjoy watching the mischief caused by the trio (aside from some comic relief from Ron's twin brothers Fred and George), but they seem to talk of darkness and death the whole time, as if the writers really want us to know how serious the situation is, to convince us that the ""times are changing"", or rather going back to how they were when Voldemort ruled earlier, a recurring theme of the film.A good side to the movie is the often change in setting. To be honest, the constant scenes within Hogwarts Castle were getting tiresome, and it is nice to see London, and the Ministry of Magic, and Harry back at old Number 4, Privet Drive. Also, the production and cinematography are nicely done, with exciting action sequences and interesting CGI characters. Speaking of the characters, there are some good additions here, notably Helena Bonham Carter as Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange, who does a good job as the maniacal murderer.So, I think the Harry Potter series has gotten too dark and too mature for its own good. Still, I suppose it would have been boring to watch the cute little owls flying around all the time, so I have to marginally recommend it."	3.0	Too Dark for Its Own Good	2007-12-26	2	1	1

They also have to wage a battle on a second front, against a sadistic dictatorial teacher named Dolores Umbridge, who has decided to remedy the ""lax"" standards at the academy and, in so doing, usurp Professor Dumbledor's position as headmaster of the school.""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" has most of what any installment in the series needs to be a success:  strong performances, dazzling special effects, and generous helpings of spells and magic.  Yet, there seems to be something missing in this episode that prevents it from soaring into that world of enchantment familiar to us from those earlier films.  For one thing, too many of the likable secondary characters - Ronald, Hermione, Hagrid etc. - take a back seat to Umbridge, who gets way more time on screen than the interest generated by the character warrants (even though Imelda Staunton is just fine in the role).  Or perhaps it's that the movie lacks the tremendously exciting action set pieces that distinguished some of the earlier editions.  And why, come to think of it, does the cinematography in a fantasy film have to be so drab, colorless and dreary?It's admirable that both the filmmakers and the original author are willing to go darker and deeper in exploring the psyche of Harry now that he`s become quite a bit older, but depth of theme really doesn't matter all that much if the magic of the series itself gets lost in the process (Michael Goldenberg has replaced Steve Kloves in the writing department and David Yates has taken over as director).Daniel Radcliffe still makes for a tremendously appealing hero, but one senses that the perhaps inevitable fatigue factor may finally be settling into this series.

David Yates had it all, a stellar cast, plenty of  base material from JK Rowling's second longest book, and special effects at his disposal and what did he and Michael Goldenberg (screenwriter taking the place of HP veteran Steve Kloves) do? They trimmed away everything interesting whatsoever about the book and left the remaining awkward shards jumbled together. For God's sake, you've got Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis and Emma Thompson sitting around doing nothing. I kept shouting at the screen ""Use them! Use them!"" How is it that one of the longest novels is turned into the shortest movie? Now, I wasn't a big fan of the 3rd or 5th books in the HP series but I was hoping that Yates, like Cuaron, would go past the source material and make the film into a triumphant masterpiece. He didn't. The payoff of the film would have to be Imelda Staunton's dead-on portrayl of the most evil Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher yet, Occlumency Lessons with Snape, of course, the trip to the Ministry of Magic and Voldemort's duel with Dumbledore. But, we all knew that those would be great. It would have been nice if the film didn't act that all it needed was a whiff-bang end and the audience would forget the shlocky job up until then. The dementors here have NONE of the atmosphere that Cuaron's did, no screaming in Harry's ears, etc, what about the Quibbler Interview, Ron's Quidditch debut, Ron and Hermione becoming prefects, the disappointment is crushing. I don't know whose fault it is, David Yates or Michael Goldenberg. I only hope that the David Yates crew (thankfully this time with Steve Kloves) will not screw up the 6th movie. It is the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the Harry Potter series and if they screw it up, I'll go nuts. For the love of God, please let Alfonso Cuaron who has mentioned he wouldn't mind directing another HP movie direct the 7th movie.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3572FTYUQQW3P	Royce Callaway	I am a grandfather who initially read Harry Potter to see what had captured the imagination of my grandchildren.  Rowling is an outstanding author and has created what in my opinion is a masterpiece.  I have now read all of the books and have seen all of the movies -- and I have enjoyed every one.  This latest film was a huge challenge to the screenwriter and director due to the sheer size of the book.  In this film we see Harry, Hermione, and Ron as near adults -- ready to graduate and certainly with much greater maturity and mastery of magic.  Certainly each movie gets darker and darker as do the books as Harry and friends encounter the growing evil of Valdemort.This was not the best of the series of films but it keeps the story moving.  The director has clearly elected to capture the essence of the story rather than to follow all of the details, which would have made an impossibly long movie.  However, for those who have never read the book, the movie moves along well.  For those who have read the book, they can fill in the details without having to see them on the screen.  The result is many of the major characters have relatively small parts in this movie.  In fact outside of Harry, Ron, and Hermione virtually all of the characters have small parts -- still the story moves along very well and you don't see the time pass.  I really liked the movie, I highly recommend it, it is probably not a movie for very young children because it shows the characters in some dangerous and threatening situations.  I only gave 4 stars because it is an abreviated version of the story -- but still well done.	4.0	A Good Summary of a BIG Book.	2007-07-23	4	2	2

I had watch it in the theater and was excited to watch on the big screen in my home.  During the opening sequence I knew something was amiss and it just got worse from there.  The video quality is the worst I have seen on a recent release highly touted movie.  I have a Toshiba HD-A2 HD DVD player which does an outstaiding job upscaling DVD's and it couldn't even help this horrendous rendering.  Interestingly the first and last 15 minutes are the worst.  During these times there is so much macro blocking it appears that Harry's glasses are actually not round but a very odd shape made of many 90 degree angles.  In the part where the kids are listening to the parents in Sirius' house with the extemdable ear, as you look up at their faces from the bottom you really can't tell who is who their faces are so blocky.  During the action sequence at the end this macro blocking is also very apparent.  I am so dissappointed that I am taking the movie back.  I will not buy and keep this kind of lousy rendering job from a top tier movie, which brings be to an interesting thought.  Are studios purposely creating DVD's that look like garbage so that their HD versions appeal more to people?  If so, this is a devious and underhanded ploy, which makes me thing that it is what is happening, so like a lemming I will go jump off a cliff and fork over twice the ammount for the HD DVD version and see what I get.	1.0	Decent movie HORRIBLE video quality	2007-12-13	0	0	0

Whenever there's any question of what to watch, this one always wins out.  The characters are really becoming 'themselves'. As mid-adolescents, they are on that cusp of being capable of fighting You-Know-Who, but are still just short of the skill and judgement of the adults.  Being left out, plus teenage angst, propel the characters to new heights - stronger friendships and understanding - while learning new and more powerful magic for the conflict they know is coming.  At the end, Daniel Radcliff does such an amazing and powerful performance - enough to rival any seasoned actor.  I believe that this is the exact point where he moves from being a 'kid actor' to an actor capable of any role. (By the way, the Ministry finally must believe that You-Know-Who has returned, and both Harry and Dumbledore are vindicated.)	5.0	Love It	2010-06-29	0	0	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	"Many arm-chair quarterbacks have slammed David Yates' turn at the helm of the ""Harry Potter"" franchise, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.""  These killjoys need to take to heart Anton Ego's soliloquy on criticism at the end of Pixar's ""Ratatouille"" and remember how hard it is to create something, but how easy it is to criticize.This is by far the most difficult adaptation of Ms. Rowling's beloved series of novels.  ""Phoenix"" is the darkest and longest of the first five novels, easily containing enough material for two films if one took the same stance as Chris Columbus and threw everything from the books into the movies.  Yates didn't have that luxury, and so drastic cuts were needed.  For devoted fans, this movie likely feels like ""highlights from Harry"" instead of a true movie, but such is the fate of most film adaptations.The question is, how good an adaptation is it?  For the most part, the movie triumphs brilliantly.  Harry is traumatized by Voldemort's murder of Cedric Diggory at the close of ""Goblet of Fire,"" but it seems that only (some) Griffindors and Albus Dumbledore are willing to admit that Voldemort is back.  The Ministry of Magic sticks its head in the sand and questions both Harry's and Dumbledore's credibility, leading to a dark analysis in the story of media manipulation and government paranoia.Not for nothing is there not a single mention of Quidditch in the entire movie.The acting is all top-notch, particularly from the three kids we've seen grow up before our eyes in this series.  The cast of experienced British actors is at their typical excellent best.  But the movie is practically stolen from our favorite heroes by a villain, and not Lord Voldemort.  Insead, Imelda Staunton swipes the movie with her evil schoolmarm, Dolores Umbridge.  This lady says more about evil with a polite 'hem-hem' and a glassy stare than any number of foam-mouthed rants by lesser actors - she is a riveting, horrible pleasure to watch.Special kudos also go out to newcomer Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood, Harry's spacy classmate.  This moon-unit's a charmer.The DVD is also chock-full of the usual DVD extras we've grown to appreciate from the Harry Potter series.  While nothing rises to the level of Peter Jackson's four-DVD sets for the Lord of the Rings movies, these are excellent additions for the kiddies (lots of games and whatnot).A must-see for any fan of Harry Potter, although die-hard fans will likely grab their dog-eared copy of ""Phoenix"" to see what exactly Yates left out."	4.0	"Dark ""Phoenix"" captures essence of fifth Harry Potter story"	2008-07-20	0	0	0

DO NOT BUY THIS DVD IF YOU DO NOT HAVE 3D CAPABILITY ON YOUR BLU-RAY PLAYER. I had forgotten that this film had 3D parts in it and didn't realize it until I had returned the first DVD for not playing on my machine.

I felt that there was too much cut out from the book, and many of the scenes felt rushed or unfinished.I was very upset when I learned that Nevil and Kreacher were denied their fairly major rolls that they had in the book, which contribute to future books and plot points.If you have not read the book, and know nothing about the book, you may have a hard time following the movie. It really cannot stand on its own at all. Action wise, it's pretty good, and some scenes were very well done, but over all I found it to be lacking. I've never felt like walking out of a movie until I saw this one. I'm not even going to bother seeing the 6th movie when it comes out.

I actually really liked this movie, eventhough I didnt like some of the new special effects, like the new dementors were not very good and the whole beginning felt very different from the book, that is not how i pictured the beginning at all, though the thestrials and the Ministry of Magic are amazing...I did like Stanton as Umbridge, she was an improvement on the annoying character in the book and the lead actors just get better and better..I've really gotten to like Gambon as Dumbledor and the scene when Voldemort battles Dumbledor is the best in the series thus far, it is spectacular.  This is a much darker film, but then again the book was dark, and Radcliffe is getting better as Harry, his acting is improving and his scenes with Gary Oldham are very good.  Overall, this is my favorite movie in the series thus far, it was the toughest book to make a movie out of so I commend the screenwriter and director for being true to the book and maybe even besting the book.  This same director is going to do the half blood prince, so im looking forward to seeing his take on that book, which is my favorite in the series.

Since I have read the series from cover to cover a number of times, I was able to fill in the gaps. However, the friends who saw it with me were not able to do that because they did not know the characters/sequence of events in great detail.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AAQTVVUDINM42	Shepherd Book	After HP3, the best of the movies. Weak special features, though, total throw-aways. That's normal for the HP dvds, though, in my opinion. Condenses the book in a way J.K. Rowling's editors should have, though there are a few things from the book it kind of misses in having to hurry on (the revolt period against Umbridge, some 500 pages into the book, was the best part in the book and is pretty truncated here). Ron was less annoying than usual, too. Hermione is still hamming it up a bit too much, but not as bad as last time. Love that Lucius Malfoy, Saruman to Voldemort's Sauron. Love that Sirius Black. Some of the older cast are getting a bit long in the tooth, but it doesn't hamper their acting.	5.0	better edited than the book	2008-06-18	1	0	1

There are a few deleted/extended scenes: we loved Emma Thompson's bit at the table, but the rest were as usual.  ""The Magic of Editing"" held  possibilities, but little real information.  The activity didn't work too well and became tiresome after a bit.  ""A Day with Tonks"" was, again, lacking in any real insight or information and, although you saw Natalie Tena made up as Tonks, you never see her film anything and at the end she says,""Well, I've had a long day ..."".  The silliest segment was ""Harry's True Destiny"", having Harry Potter ""experts"" make predictions about the character's future, when the final book came out within a week of the fifth move, so that by the time this DVD was put together, everyone already knew the ending!

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3HJPY2ZPZDZG	"Shining Purple Eyes ""Liv 14"""	I've read all of the Harry Potter books from 1 to 7 and I'm a really, really big fan. I waited months and months for this film and when I finally saw it, I was slightly, slightly dissapointed. True, I would give it a 4 and a half if I could. It's just that it didn't seem good as a movie. I mean, I was with 3 friends who haven't even read one page of HP and they couln't understand what was going on at all. And I didn't blame them. It just looks like the screenplayer tried to put as much stuff as he could from the book in that- what 2 hour and a half?- movie and so it was just scene- scene- scene after scene of action. In the book, they let the story develop, while in the film they didn't seem to be getting anywhere. Okay, I totally understand that the couldn't fit the whole plot in, but still- they could of done at least like in Goblet of Fire where, even if they cut off half the book plot, there was a story that you could follow in the movie so people that didn't read the books could understand too. But I didn't see much of that here. Maybe a bit, but not enough...Still though, the acting was fantastic, except maybe for Dan Radcliffe (Harry) and Micheal Gambon (Dumbledore) who weren't so great.As for the other actors: KEEP IT UP!!! I especially thought that Luna and Umbridge (who were only introduced in this book and film) were spectacularI really hope that Half- Blood Prince (which is my fav book) is better.Ok other fans.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2OCAHFWBWB6T6	Shredd	"Let me just say that I have not read any of the other reviews so if I duplicate, forgive me. *POSSIBLE SPOILERS WILL BE CONTAINED HEREIN*For a massive Harry Potter fan as myself, to have to give this movie a bad review is akin to having Snape for Potions (you get that sick feeling in your stomach), but it was truly awful. Since I've read the series several times it's obviously hard to forget how it was in the book. However, when watching the movies I try to distance myself from that for the reason in the title of the review. This particular movie is not Harry Potter. It is Harry Potter-esque. The characters have the same names and the movie very vaguely resembles the book but if you are a Harry purist you will need to STAY FAR AWAY from this movie. If you like well written plots and a decent viewing flow, you will need to avoid this movie.This movie made no sense. I was completely relieved that I didn't buy it but only borrowed from a friend. I found it to be a bit boring and my attention kept slipping away. I felt the acting to be terribly uninspired. Case in point is Arabella Figg. When the dementors attack Harry and Dudley and he's trying to hide his wand so she doesn't see it, she comes up to him all calm and says gently, ""Don't put your wand away. They may come back."" I mean, this is DEMENTORS....creatures that suck out your soul through your FACE! Wouldn't you be JUST a litte panicked???? especially if they show up in your home town MILES away from Azkaban...even more especially because you are a Squib with no wand??? Wouldn't you be a little flustered even, not all cool and calm as if you've just had a terrific relaxing massage at a day spa?It was also rather confusing because the scenes seemed to be so choppy, and I found myself having to rewind the DVD several times in order to catch some scenes. Blink, and you appear to miss a pivotal moment. eg. the thestrals. I figure the director thought he'd got to put in a brilliant flying scene so he had to leave the thestrals in. Fair enough but we only see them twice in the movie. The first is when Harry asks what's pulling the carriages and Hermione says that they just pull themselves like always. She looks at him all worried like he's lost his marbles. Luna tells him that he's not crazy. She sees them too. Thestrals are never mentioned again until Luna suggests that they fly to the Ministry of Magic. Um...wouldn't you protest (especially if you were RON!) if you had to get on a creature only visible to Luna and Harry? Not a word of this in the movie. Everyone is happily flying on invisible thestrals. Since we barely see Hagrid in this movie, we would've missed his Care of Magical Creatures lesson when he talks about the thestrals etc.So, BAM! they're talking about getting to the Ministry, then BAM! they're on thestrals, then BAM! they're running to the Ministry, then BAM! they're in the Dept. of Mysteries. Phew! All this happens in about two minutes! This was one of the sections I had to rewind. Silly me. I blinked. It would've been faster and simpler to have them apparate. Forget the Decree for the Restiction of Underage Magic (or the fact they haven't learnt to apparate yet). What's the point of trying to stick to SOME facts hard and fast when most of the movie doesn't conform to the book anyway?Some scenes were pointless and added nothing to the movie - Grawp and the centaurs in the forest with Umbridge..what was that about? Hagrid could've just said that he brought his brother back. Sirius showing Harry the family tree...huh? why? I would rather have seen Mrs. Black's picture screaming foul things. The thestral references could've been cut. What can I say in the director's defence? To be fair, it's a rather LONG book to condense. Unfortunately, if you are a fan of the book, you'll be disappointed by the movie; and in order to GET the movie (or at least some parts of it) you'll have to have read the book.Michael Gambon is STILL a terrible Albus Dumbledore although he's gotten better since his first appearance (R.I.P Richard Harris...he had it down pat) - Dumbledore is a gentle, unassuming character that very rarely raises his voice to get what he wants. He uses words and logic as his weapons mostly. Michael still seems to think he's theatre acting and although there is much less flinging himself about and shouting, he is still acting too ""big"" in this role.The biggest surprise for me was the casting of Luna (Evanna Lynch). She is rather brilliant in this role. Very airy fairy and sweet. Could've been a little more oddball but altogether the perfect Luna. She's the saving grace of this movie. I only wish we saw her more.It goes without saying that I've been disappointed since Chris Columbus left this project because he's been truest to the books but even if this movie wasn't true to the book, it still isn't very good. I was quite surprised to see hundreds of people give it 4 and 5 stars. Ah well, to each his own."	1.0	Your imagination is bigger than  a movie budget	2008-02-19	9	5	4

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1VABWDOUQLULZ	S. K. Harrell	"I liked this film much better than GOF, in terms of lateral comparison. It was a radical departure from the book, though. The former films have omitted details; this one changed the plot pretty significantly. I can accept a film in a different universe than its book, but this is unsettlingly different. Cho was wronged by the screenwriters, much as I can't stand the character. There is no real explanation for the twins sudden dramatic departure. The relevance of Harry's insight into Snape is without anchor. Lucius' role is... well out of proportion (though easy on the eyes). Neville's parents are glossed over, as is the sharing of his birthday with Harry. Sirius' madness is overlooked, thus the later misnomer has little impact. Sirius is aveda'ed. It ended on a way too hopeful note. I am very disappointed with the way Sirius' death was handled. It was anticlimactic. It was too subtle. Part of that was Helena Bonham Carter seeming quite blas&eacute; in her role. She didn't seem like she really wanted to be there so I wasn't really vested in her wrongly cast spell against Sirius. I do feel the silence following Sirius' parting worked against the scene, not for it, creating levity rather than tragic density of emotion. All of the core actors have grown in their roles except Emma. She is mostly heaving chest and eyebrows in this film. She is a beauty, though, and certainly dedicated. Everyone else, though, was wonderful. Dan has come a long way in his acting ability. In this film he comes into his own as an actor. Rup rules, as usual. Draco was under used. This is the first time I thought any of the young ones looked older than their character's ages, specifically Dan and the twins. Evanna Lynch is wonderful. Visually the film is stunning. It is non stop movement, physically and emotionally. The chemistry between Daniel and Gary is spot on. They are very physically comfortable with each other and the little aside touches were in that way more telling than the many embraces that we were to assimilate as ""family."" There wasn't as much tight writing in this one. Clearly the emphasis had refocused to deepening the emotional range of the characters and actors. I love Rickman and Isaacs.My favorite moment of the film (apart from the ""LOOK AT ME"" bit) was when Sirius tells harry that when this is all over they will be a proper family, then closes the door on his own family tree. So symbolic, that.The extras on this DVD were not as unwieldy to navigate as with the other DVD releases, but they still would be entertaining to little ones.

Taking the longest book and making it the shortest movie was a poor idea. Potter fans would gladly sit through a 3-hour movie if it meant more of the book was in there. Instead, we get a bunch of sequences which make very little sense to someone who hasn't read the Potter books. It looks very choppy, with scenes simply slammed together. The acting was underplayed, and terribly so- it was tough to find any real emotion, even when Snape catches Harry peaking in his pensieve! So it was difficult to feel emotionally involved with the whole thing. It felt stiff, stodgy, and disjointed. Sure, I'll still buy it, but someone else should have put this one together.  Compared to the other 4 movies, this one looks amateur-ish.	3.0	worst of the 5 movies	2007-09-20	9	6	3

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A10BT85QEKBZNZ	SMS CA	Harry Potter and the order of the phoenix is a great movie to watch if you like fantasy, and magic. If you have not seen Harry Potter #'s 1-4 then I suggest that you should start there and work your way up to Harry potter and the order of the phoenix.Now here is some detail about the movie Harry's cousin is always picking on him until they are attacked by dominators and Harry knows how to beat them. Later he gets picked up by an old Hogwarts professor mad eye moony and some other people from the order of the phoenix pick him up. Then after they got off the train at Hogwarts Draco, say's that he sees a cell in Azkaban and Harry wants to kill him but Ron was holding him back from attacking Draco Malfoy. I think that everyone needs to at see the first to movies of Harry Potter, and the first two books. Now a little more about the movie Harry Potter has to take occlumency to stop from seeing visions about Voldemort and a snake every time he goes to sleep and then wakes up all sweaty and exalted. One night he had a dream that Voldemort's snake attacking Arnold Weasly and he was taken to the headmaster by Ron and McGonagall and then the Weasly kids were sent home early before Christmas break because there dad is in very bad condition because whatever they do it just gets dissolved because of the snake venom. The stitches kept dissolving like they were not there because the venom. The headmaster Dumbledore keeps avoiding Harry to see if he would be more protective since Voldemort is back and trying to build an army and also a secret weapon to kill Harry Potter and Dumbledore. I myself rate this movie 10 out of 10.	5.0	C.C.'s Review	2008-04-16	1	0	1
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A223UJ9MON2Y8N	"Snape42 ""Toad, esq."""	I think this was the best of Potter films - and don't try to compare it to the book!  There will always be variation from page to screen.  In terms of the film itself, it's really the most entertaining of the 6 that have so far been released.  The younger actors seem to find their stride a little more in this film.  They are all becoming a little more ambiguous, and therefore more interesting.  I also find this story to have been the best of the books because the Severus Snape character becomes so controversial, and he was always my favorite, and when played by my favorite actor, Alan Rickman, the universe makes sense for one shining moment.Regarding the DVD release:  If you haven't heard, Ultimate Editions of the Harry Potter films are going to be released beginning with the first two films on 8 December.  These movies are longer and have the deleted scenes added back into the films themselves - much like the versions that crop up on ABC Family.  Just like the LOR films, the length of the movies appears to get longer with each release.  I believe the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone will be about 7 minutes longer, while the second movie is supposed to be about 16 minutes longer (something like that).  Unless you just really want the mask, wait and get the ultimate edition - if you can wait that long.	5.0	5 Stars for the Film, but I'll wait on the DVD	2009-11-19	1	1	0

Overall, an expertly crafted film which will leave you a bit unsatisfied, and make you wish for more.As for the Special Edition features, I must say that the extras are rather light, and I feel like the producers got lazy this time around.

Harry and Cho's story, Harry saving Mr. Weasly could have been improved upon and the hospital part in the book was extremely necessary which has been left out in the movie. There is no real chemistry in the actors in the movie. They just seem to be going through the motions ( compare this to the first two movies of the series where everyone acted superbly ).Maybe the actors have grown up but that can't be the case since Hermione , Ron , Neville , Luna etc still act well.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AG7SA3TYL1AQ3	sundance	Let me begin by saying that I am one of millions that agree too much was cut from the book when the movie was made. To me, it's completely idiotic to take the longest book of the series and make it into the shortest of all 8 movies. Especially considering how horrible a job they did with HP & the Deathly Hallows Pt 1 & 2. And they spilt the movie into two parts! There was so much they could've done with this movie. One of the long standing arguements has always been there's no way they could have put out a 3-4 hour movie. BS! Show me one HP fan who would not have willingly sat through a four hour HP movie! LOL. That said, here are my vies on the movie. I've broken them down into different sections.CASTING: Overall, I've almost always agreed with the casting for the characters for the movies, not just this one. Umbridge/Imelda Staunton= Brilliant! I actually had to remind myself it was the character I detested and not Staunton herself, she played the character so well. Luna/Evanna Lynch= One of the best casting choices in all eight movies! Lynch IS Luna! Sirius/Gary Oldman= I'll just come out and say it. Everything Gary is involved in turns to gold. Actors like Gary Oldman only come around once in a lifetime. Snape/Alan Rickman= The reason this man is a magnificent actor, one of the best in history, in the world, is because he's a camilleon. No two roles he plays are the same. Rickman drowned himself in the character of Snape. So well, he played it perfectly. Some of my other choices for great casting were: McGonagall/Maggie Smith, Dumbledore/Michael Gambon, Trelawney/Emma Tompson, Voldemort/Ralph Fiennes, Kingsley/George Harris, Lucius Malfoy/Jason Isaacs, Hagrid/Robbie Coltrane. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, perhaps the best casting choice, Bellatrix Lestrange/Helena Bonham Carter! She was outstanding! As for the poor choices, or the ones that I think could have been played a bit differently, not necessarily a different actor. Harry's parents, the Dursley Family, Tonks and Remus, Fred and George Weasley, Draco, Neville and Molly Weasley.CG: Let's face it, the jury is not out on this. All the animated scenes, such as the Ministry of Magic with the globes, the flying scenes, Grawp, when the centaurs run off with Unbridge, exc.CUT SCENES: Lets face it, they butchered the book. This was a book where everything changed, a pivotal book. The movie was in essence a slap in the face to all HP fans. The cutting of certain scenes were very poor choices. Such as: Hermione's attempt at freeing all house elves, quidditch, the St Mungo's scenes, the Occlumency scenes between Snape and Harry, everything that is Grimmauld Place and the Department of Mysteries, Dumbledore's escape when accused by Fudge and Umbridge of forming the D.A., and so on. But the worst of all, is the simple dismissing of Sirius. In the book it's a truly heartbreaking scene. But in the movie? His death barely gets acknowledged, you can't hear Harry's anguished screaming, using the Avada Kedavra curse on Bellatrix, Lupin's attempt at calming Harry.In all, the book got a 6 out of 5 stars. The movie got a 3 out of 5 stars.	3.0	A blow below the belt	2012-03-18	1	1	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2ZHH7AK83JB5G	"Susan K. Schoonover ""Sue Yingling"""	The filmmakers had to make some tough choices in deciding what  to include when adapting the lengthy ORDER OF THE PHOENIX for the movies and for the most part they have done a great job.  The sequence where Mr. Weasley is attacked seems a bit rushed and if I hadn't read the book I might not have understood what was happening there.  I also would have liked to have seen Neville visiting his parents at St. Mungo's though that might have been too poignant of a scene for this all ready quite dark movie and the Longbottoms's situation is discussed.  One of the greatest pleasures of this series is seeing the child actors  growing up from kids to teenagers and all the major players both teens and adults  do a great job.  Imelda Staunton is comically loathsome as Dolores Umbridge and I think we've all known her slightly less exaggerated counterparts in the muggle world. I've always been a fan of both Helena Bonham-Carter and Emma Thompson each now in  middle age and wonderful in character parts in this film as the evil deranged witch Bellatrix and the hapless divination teacher Sybil Trelawney respectively.  As in all the previous Potter movies special acting honors should go to Alan Rickman for playing so well the complex and enigmatic Snape.  And the set and special effects look absolutely spectacular on the screen.  One caution the dementors in the opening scene, Harry's visions and the battle scenes are all very intense so think carefully about taking kids under ten.	5.0	Excellent Film Adaptation Of Fifth Harry Potter Novel	2007-07-23	7	6	1

But Professor Dolores Umbridge's Ministry-approved course of defensive magic leaves the young wizards woefully unprepared to defend themselves against the dark forces threatening them and the entire wizarding community, so at the prompting of his friends Hermione and Ron, Harry takes matters into his own hands.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A311L6YC4N0BKN	TDrinkrrr	"Pity the poor director of a Harry Potter movie.  One one side we have the Indiana Jones contingent, who want a jolly romp through Hogwarts without any serious undercurrent.  One the other you have the book nuts, who want the HP series to play like Wagner's Ring cycle and not leave anything out.  Then there's your cast, and here a specially dishonorable mention must go to Michael Gambon's Dumbledore, who seems intent on portraying him as a faintly psychotic aging hippy.  (When he roughs up Harry in the Goblet of Fire - what was that about??)It is indisputable that as the series progressed, the books become more serious.  At some point, then, the ""jolly romp"" contingent will be disappointed.  I think HP5 marks the break.  It is really hard to imagine how a moviegover who had not read the book could understand how sinister Umbridge is.  This trend will only deepen: in HP6 we'll be handling Tom Riddle's childhood, horcruxes, and themes of suffering and betrayal, and HP7 of course is even deeper.  The scene where Hermione is tortured in Malfoy Manor whilst Ron screams for her in the basement is unlikely to be a happy one.So, accepting that HP movies from 5 on will not be happy adventures, how does 5 stack up for the book nuts?  I'd give it a 3 or 4 out of 5. I think it should have been darker, like the book.  The fact that it wasn't is due to some of the material being cut (well, that's ok, let's not watch a 15-hour movie) and some of the actors' limited range.  Daniel Radcliffe is not a bad actor, but he's not up to the job of acting like HP in the book, who is going through wild teenage angsty mood swings.  Well, what do you expect from a young man who is at the start of his career.  It's like Hamlet; by the time an actor has lived enough to handle the soliloquy, he ain't no young prince.I liked Imelda Staunton's performance but it wasn't quite sinister enough.  She can't be too pink 'n' fluffy or else some of that menace is lost.  Remember that the DA is an underground resistance movement for which the members are risking expulsion; it's way more serious than a group of disgruntled students who don't like a particular teacher."	4.0	You can't please all the people, all the time	2007-12-03	17	16	1

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3UWRNANSWCXW6	Terry Nightingale	It can't be easy to condense a 700+ page novel into a circa two-hour film, and some would argue that it should not be attempted.  I for one say director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have done an admirable job in delivering the next satisfying installment of the Harry Potter saga.Considering the directorial revolving door since Chris Columbus' departure after the second filmHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I'm impressed at the consistency and coherency represented by the films to date.  Five movies in, I've stopped obsessing about what was left out from the books, and have mostly agreed with what plot elements were left in.  The one exception in this fifth movie was the total absence of Quidditch, which I've always viewed as something that helps tie all the books together.Visually the film was yet another stunning experience.  By now the magical effects are so well integrated that it's easy to just accept them and not be distracted from the story.  Fred and George's grand exit from Hogwart's was all I expected, and just when I was afraid their magical novelties were no more interesting than a Muggle fireworks display, they kicked it up a notch and came through with an outlandish finale.We also got our first look at the Ministry of Magic, again well executed with appropriately varied costumes and magnificent sets.  The giant banner of Cornelius Fudge was appropriately Orwellian, and its later burning a subtle symbolic hint of his political future.There was a great deal that made this film worth seeing, and for maximum visual effect I recommend seeing it in the theater if you still have the chance.	4.0	An admirable film treatment of a rather long novel	2007-08-12	6	5	1

Despite being directed by the same director (David Yates), the 6th movie was terrible. (And I don't even blame Yates for it. This movie, was all Yates. The 6th movie was Yates with Warner execs stepping on his throat. It was like Warner wanted to turn Harry Potter into Hannah Montana). So I decided to go back and watch again ""The order of the Phoenix"". I can tell you this is by far, the best Harry Potter movie ever made. It's darker, grittier and more spectacular than any other. There are wizard duels in this movie that will literally blow your mind. The teen angst factor, even thou present, plays quietly in the background while the wonderful story, Potter Mythology and wizard Badassery play the main role here. It's everything the Half blood prince should have been and wasn't.And the best part? Not a single quidditch scene whatsoever. Not even one.

Thankfully the guys at Hogwarts got rid of the long hair from the last movie, and Daniel Radcliffe now truly personifies Harry Potter.  Overall, the movie is visually striking particularly the Ministry of Magic which looks fantastic.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1JMM1O4GYDM9K	The Good Doctor	My daughter, who read the book, and I watched this film together. She loves to read these books and immediately watch the movie as a sort of reward, as was the case for this viewing. Her comments were that she generally enjoyed the film but found it &#34;inaccurate&#34; in comparison with the book and stated &#34;they left out some of the funny parts&#34; along with &#34;I'm sure it's confusing, if you haven't read the book.&#34;  Comments like this are always my opportunity to  point out the supremecy of literarture over cinema. Now on with the review.Having not read the book, I was glad to have a resident expert to ask little questions like &#34;whose that?' and &#34;Isn't that the guy from the other movie who...&#34; Those questions being answered, I enjoy the films as an opportunity to watch great actors like Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman, Micheal Gambon, Ralph Fiennes, Emma Thompson, and Maggie Smith all in one place. Honestly, I sometimes put the plot on hold and just watch the choices these actors make in embodying these rather fantastical characters. It's all part of the appeal of the series, and what makes it unnecessary for me to watch every single one in order. So yes I reccommend the film as either another installment in dependable series or as a study of the craft of acting.Most importantly, I enjoy these films as a parent becuase unlike other films such as  &#34;Pitch Perfect&#34; and &#34;Fun Size&#34;, which are aimed at a similar audience and are not without merit,I don't have to justify, sift out, and drill down through three layers of profanity just to uncover a redemptive theme, so I can tell myself it's okay that I purchased this film.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3T2G352GLIEZZ	"The Legend Of Megadon ""MEGAN"""	As both a fan of the book and the movies I was very disappointed by the film. It did not do the book justice. Though OoTP was a long book more of the lighter, funnier and better story lines could of been included in the film without making it run too long. Many details were changed such as Sirus calling Harry James, Cho was the one who ratted out DA, Luna and Harry meeting in the woods to discuss Thestrals, Harry drawing his wand in front of Dudley's friends and so on. Professor Trewlany who is a delight has minimal screen time which was disappointing . But what was more disappointing was the fact Sirius was barely in the film and that Luna had barely any screen time. Besides the Weasly twins Luna made the book more interesting. By cutting down the Luna story line this made the film very tense. Im am non plussed at this point. I thought the first 2 films stayed very true to the book and had that pardon the pun the magic that makes a movie great. I loved the fact the third and forth films were darker but certain details were changed or omitted much like this the fifth film. The acting from Radcliffe was different as if he no longer had to try and the acting flowed from him which made him more natural in this film. I was a little disappointed in the casting of Luna Lovegood but then the actress had such little screen time the made her seem meek. I was also disappointed because we did not see as much of the trio as in the previous films. Hermoine and Ron are important to the plot and they had been in more scenes the film would of been better. I have never really cared for the new Dumbledore this actor makes Dumbledore seem tense,uncaring and harsh at times. It was a good film but if you loved the book as much as I did don't expect to love this movie as much as the book.	4.0	Don't expect the movie to be like the book	2008-01-08	1	1	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A1KMG1AIUS00DC	"The Movie Man ""tenebre89"""	"For fans of Harry Potter, reviews are beside the point.  They will adore ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" the fifth film in the lucrative Warner Brothers franchise based on the enormously popular J.K. Rowling books.  But for average, non-Potter addicted movie goers, this installment will have a strong sense of deja vu.The current film begins with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) concluding a summer among the Muggles.  As his cousin and his cousin's sneering posse taunt Harry and try to provoke a fight, they are set upon by a couple of Dementors.  Harry uses magic to vanquish them, a feat that lands him in hot water at Hogwarts.  He has used magic in the presence of a Muggle.  Put on trial, Harry is exonerated only by the intervention of Dumbledore (Michael Gambon).The theme of the film is established in this opening sequence:  The potential for good and evil exists in everyone.  The path to either is fraught with consequences.  The person you become rests with the choices you make.Harry and pals Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) discover changes at Hogwarts that are detrimental and destructive, and must covertly develop their powers to combat them.  The fascistic Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) has been sent to Hogwarts by the Ministry to fix everything that's wrong.  She installs a new, useless curriculum that contains no means for the student wizards to defend themselves against threats from the Dementors and Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes).Unlike earlier Potter films, ""Order of the Phoenix"" devotes surprisingly little screen time to the Harry/Ron/Hermione friendship.  In fact, Ron and Hermione are more like supporting than main characters.  Director David Yates and screenwriter Andrew S. Walsh have streamlined the novel to avoid an overly long running time, but the movie suffers in the details, some visuals, subplots (especially of Ron), and character development.Radcliffe is lankier and with more of a brooding quality than in previous Potter films, and his acting has matured.  He keeps his Harry grounded, even though a world of fantasy is the film's milieu.  His ability to make Harry a young Everyman is a key element in the movie series' success.  Radcliffe gives Harry a darker coloring this time so that he becomes less the fun-loving kid, amazed and thrilled at every new experience.  As an almost-adult, he sees real danger in the world around him.  Rather than leaving these dangers to the adults to reckon with, he is at the fore in confronting them himself.  His sense of responsibility to a greater good is being tested in ""Order of the Phoenix,"" and this growth of character draws us in.Next to Radcliffe, Ms. Staunton has the most central role in ""Order of the Phoenix.""  Her Dolores Umbridge is every child's nightmare of the authoritarian figure from hell.  Self-righteous, power-hungry, toadying to her superiors, nit picking and petty, she has been armed with carte blanche from on high to destroy all independent thinking and competence at the school.  Dressed in assorted suits of flamingo pink hues and chirping with ominous cheer, she is everywhere, sticking her nose in corners, taking notes on teachers' performance and evaluating the school's efficiency as one might check on a factory's assembly line output.  Ms. Staunton, nominated for her moving performance as ""Vera Drake,"" gives a broad, over-the-top performance that sometimes renders her Umbridge a bit cartoonish, but it is nonetheless fun to watch this veteran chow down on the scenery.Gary Oldman, as Sirius Black, becomes Harry's ally in battling the forces of evil and comes off as a sort of young Ben Kenobi as he mentors and fights beside Harry.  Ralph Fiennes, in horrid make-up and prosthetics, is unrecognizable as Voldemort, but succeeds in infusing him with both stature and menace.  Fiennes' screen time is brief, but his Voldemort commands every scene he's in.Special effects are present in ""Order of the Phoenix,"" of course, but they're not as frequent or impressive as in the earlier Potter films.  When we do have an effects sequence, it is welcome, and usually fits well into the unfolding story.  There is a sense of wonder, for instance, when the young wizards secretly practice their spells and apparition-like animals dart hither and yon.  There is also a wonderful sequence of winged creatures transporting Harry and his friends over the countryside, and one of the mysterious, shadowy centaurs grouped menacingly in the dark of the woods.The Catch-22 of the Harry Potter movies is the belief that if not all of the book's sequences are included in the movie, loyal fans will rise up in protest.  On the other hand, if every sequence is included, the movie becomes a three-hour exercise in bladder control.Director Yates understands this dilemma and has gone the route of a tight running time, though at 138 minutes, it could still stand some trimming.  I have always felt that a movie should stand on its own and not depend on every viewer knowing every plot turn or slavishly including every sequence.  No movie can provide the detail that a book can, nor do movies have the time to do it.""Order of the Phoenix"" comes off as a less-than-stellar adaptation of the Rowling book."	2.0	A Brooding Harry Potter Returns	2007-12-25	0	0	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"Harry Potter nirvana this summer, the film based on the fifth book has just been released and the seventh and last (?) book has just been published. I have yet to finish the book, but I have seen ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"".The fifth book in the series; ""Order of the Phoenix"" is not my favorite entry by author Rowling. Director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have managed to downplay many of the elements that made the book slightly unpleasant and put more focus on the characters. ""Phoenix"" is the longest book and the shortest film, so far, so some elements have been removed completely, for good and bad. But the increased dramatic skills of the three leads, fantastic set design and special effects and a supporting cast of every British character actor ever to appear in film, combine to make this a most enjoyable installment in the film series.My main problem with the book was Harry was portrayed as too typical a teenager. Yes, he was at that age, so show a little of it, but Harry is supposed to be above such things. He fought with Dumbledore, Ron and Hermione, and this went on and on. Worse, he ignored the advice and instructions of his friends, making him seem a little dumb.Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is spending another summer with the Dursleys (Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw) and their nincompoop son, Dudley (Harry Melling). Sitting on a swing, trying to avoid the heat, Dudley comes up with two friends and tries to pick a fight. The weather turns and Dudley and Harry run into an underground tunnel to escape the downpour. Two aurors immediately descend and attack Harry and Dudley. Harry quickly uses his wand and fights them off. Before you know it, he is called before the Ministry of Magic to answer the charge of using magic in front of Muggles. Mad Eye Mooney (Brendan Gleeson) and other members of the Order of the Phoenix arrive to take Harry to their secret headquarters. There, he spots Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), his godfather, and the rest of his faithful friends and supporters. He is a bit petulant about Ron and Hermione's lack of communication, but softens up when he hears they were ordered by Dumbledore to remain silent. The next morning, at his hearing, Harry is surprised to see Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) appear in his defense. The matter is quickly settled, but Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge decides to appoint Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton, ""Vera Drake"") as the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Upon their arrival, Harry, Ron and Hermione are amazed to learn they will be learning no practical magic, just theory; no one seems to believe Lord Voldemort has returned, so they form a study group of their own, under Harry's tutelage. But will Professor Umbridge, now appointed a sort of Hogwarts High Inquisitor, be able to find out their plans. Will Professor Snipe (Alan Rickman) be able to help Harry defend himself against He Who Must Not Be Named (Ralph Fiennes)?Directed by David Yates (HBO's ""The Girl in the Caf&eacute;"", lots of British television) and written by Michael Goldenberg (""Peter Pan"", ""Contact""), ""Order of the Phoenix"" moves at a fast clip, combining nice tongue in cheek humor with good, believable moments of the kids taking matters into their own hands. Add some great set design and some amazing special effects and you have a really enjoyable movie.""Harry Potter 5"" is the darkest film to date, which is appropriate because the books get progressively darker as the stakes become higher for Harry and his friends and associates. As the danger increases, people die and Harry has to live with that; in ""Phoenix"", he still deals with the death of Cedric during the Tri Wizard Finals in ""Goblet of Fire"". But as Harry is growing up, he also has other things to contend with, mainly puberty, and he can't seem to keep his eyes off Cho Chang (Katie Leung), who is also grieving over the death of Cedric, her boyfriend. Will Harry and Cho give in to their temptations and enjoy a little kiss?Hogwart's Professor of Defense of the Dark Arts has proven to be a difficult position for Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) to staff. Each year, the professor runs into problems and leaves the position. This allows Rowling and the filmmakers to introduce new characters and give a variety of great British actors a good role to sink their teeth into. ""Order of the Phoenix"" is no exception and introduces us to Professor Dolores Umbridge. Played by Imelda Staunton (""Vera Drake"", ""Freedom Writers""), Umbridge is a prissy woman, always dressed in pink, who has a lot of cats. Yet, when crossed, she can be extremely nasty, while always maintaining a sickly sweet demeanor. Umbridge is appointed to the position by the Minister of Magic, to keep an eye on Dumbledore, who he suspects is trying to take his job. At Hogwarts, she immediately decorates her office in pink and hangs many plates depicting her favorite pet cats. But don't let the grandmotherly exterior fool you. If you cross her, she is not above having you write lines with a special quill that will also write the words in your flesh, providing a permanent reminder of your impertinence.There has been a bit of press in the last year about Daniel Radcliffe's debut in ""Equus"" on the London stage. Apparently, he disrobed in one scene and was so self conscious about the role that he worked out a lot to make sure he looked good. What does this mean to this film? Not a lot, except Radcliffe has matured and become a bit more buff since even the last film.Perhaps his stage debut has helped in another way. In ""Order of the Phoenix"", Radcliffe, and for that matter, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, have all significantly developed their acting ability. Radcliffe, who as the main character, appears in virtually every scene, has really become a very good actor and brings all of this talent to this story. As Harry Potter, Radcliffe has to show the most range of emotion, conflict, joy and character development. He has always been good, but in the last few films, his skill has developed exponentially and he finally appears to be a natural actor, giving the character traits and ideals we didn't necessarily get in the first few films.Rupert Grint, who plays Ron, Harry's best friend, is the actor who has developed the most during the series. He no longer relies on bugged out eyes and comical mannerisms and has relaxed, allowing his character to become more natural.Because the three kids have grown up playing these roles, they seem to finally be comfortable with the characters. As they have grown, so have the three friends, each bringing their own personalities to the role and making them unique and interesting.It seems with each of the films, the various adult actors have their moments in the sun and then fade into the background, providing a rich background for the kid actors. In ""Phoenix"", Emma Thompson's Sybil Trelawney and David Thewlis' Remus Lupin have the briefest of roles. Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall has a few choice moments, including a showdown with Professor Umbridge.But the real star of the supporting cast is, as always, Alan Rickman. Despite the relatively few scenes featuring Professor Snape, his character is too important to the overall fabric of these stories to fade into the background. In his first scene, Rickman only has to stare at Umbridge, as she questions him about his history at Hogwarts to perfectly exhibit every trait of his character. He utters a single word, ""Obviously"", eliciting laughter from the audience. When he speaks, his voice rolls off his tongue in a decidedly sticky manner, providing the character with all of the conflict it needs.Helena Bonham Carter also makes a first appearance as Bellatrix Lastrange, the sister of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), and an ally of Voldemort. She breaks out of Azkaban prison and then makes her way back to London to aid Voldemort, using her hatred of Muggles and half-breeds as fuel. The role is very over the top, but nonetheless interesting to watch.In ""Phoenix"", the filmmakers introduce us to Sirius' house, a property he has donated to the Order of the Phoenix, for their use as a headquarters. They also show us to the Ministry of Magic for the first time. Each of these locations is fantastic. The attention to detail really helps both seem real and add to the ever-growing world of ""Harry Potter"". I don't want to go into too much detail, because you should experience them for yourself.Each of the film translations has trimmed bits of story here and there. It is a necessity; there is no way they could film everything in any single book and make a single movie. There was talk about making ""Goblet of Fire"" into two movies, one of which would be released in the summer with the conclusion released at Thanksgiving. But they decided against that. In ""Order of the Phoenix"", they chopped out entire stories, making the resulting film leaner, faster and perhaps even a little darker. Gone is the Quidditch match in which Ron leads his team to victory. Gone is Doby the house elf and Hermione's efforts to help the house elves organize against their oppressors. These would have added time to the film and the film doesn't seem to suffer extraordinarily due to their absence. It just seems odd to have a Harry Potter film with no references to Quidditch. None. Zero. Zilch.""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" proves to be yet another example of the trend this entire series of films has established. Much like the actors playing the three leads, the films just keep getting better and better."	4.0	No Quidditch, But One of the Better Films	2007-07-26	0	0	0

After he sees the murder of his friend Cedric by the evil Lord Voldemort, Harry finds himself at the brunt of a smear campaign. Seems the head of the Ministry of Magic doesn't like the fact that Harry and Professor Dumbledore are talking about Voldemort's return and is doing everything he can to discredit their reputations. Sort of like the Fox News of magic.As such, Fudge contrives to have the persnickety policy stooge Delores Umbridge (a perfectly cast Imelda Staunton) to makes sure that Hogwarts operates in the manner the ministry deems most fit, even if it means playing dirty. Dissent is callously stifled, relationships are prudishly regulated and students are forced to take equivalency exams that drive Hermione to gripe ""We're not learning how to defend ourselves; we're learning how to pass our O.W.L.s."" (No wizard left behind, maybe?) The movie then shifts into high gear, driving Harry and a select group of students into an underground mission, to train against Lord Voldemort and protect Hogwarts from not just the evil without but from the conservatives within.Where ""The Order of The Phoenix"" significantly differs from the other Harry Potter films is in its seriousness. Snape (Alan Rickman finally getting to reassert his character away from buffoonery) reveals why his animosity for Harry runs so deep. Ron and Hermione are acting as young adults, with new characters (Cho, Nymphadora and Luna) sparking Harry's adolescent hormones. Draco Malfoy is not a caricature in this film, and his father Luscious returns as a malevolent force. Helena Bonham Carter brings villainy to Bellatrix Lestrange (shrieking ""You Half Blood!"" at Harry at one moment). The whimsical tone ofHarry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsandHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stoneis replaced (and is kind of a loss) by the darkening of the mood and themes. But after all, it is hard to stay young and cute after 6 years and with an Evil Lord jamming your mind and seeking to destroy you.""Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix"" is a transitional movie in a series gradually forging into maturity. In fact, this is a difficult movie to recommend for younger children because of the darker themes and political intrigue (torturing students is pretty darn dark, even as fantasy goes). But as Daniel Radcliff shows that his acting skills are advancing beautifully and the series refuses to bland out, this is a highly recommendable DVD."	4.0	Harry Potter Gets Political	2007-12-28	0	0	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2YKADCJME4FSW	Tom Birkenstock	"When last we left our hero, Harry Potter, he had just faced a newly repowered Voldemort 2.0.  So it's a puzzling turn of events when Harry returns to Hogwarts only to discover that he has been branded a liar and that Voldermort's existence has been vehemently denied by the Ministry of Magic.  Harry's role as an inventor of canards has turned him into an outcast at Hogwarts where the other students look at him askance and openly doubt his story.  But even as the Ministry denies the impeding threat, a secret organization called The Order of the Phoenix has set out to defend itself against Voldemort and the Death Eaters.There are duel villains in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  Not only must Harry worry about Voldermort from without, but he must also contend with the Ministry of Magic from within.  As is often the case with a new Harry Potter film, there is also a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  This time the new professor, Delores Umbridge, has been generously provided by the Ministry, and she immediately sets changes in the curriculum and the school rules.  The Ministry is fearful that Dumbledore is amassing an army of teenagers, so Umbridge does away with all experiential learning, prohibiting the students from using magic in class and relying on textbooks alone.Delores Umbridge is the type of villain who appears tailor made to get under your skin.  She wears bright pink outfits that seem to have been shipped from the early 1960s.  She always doles out punishment with a healthy smile on her face.  And, she covers the walls of her office with the kinds of collectible plates you can buy at 2am on the Home Shopping Network.  Of course, each plate depicts a mewling kitten that actually mewls.  As far as movie villains go, Umbridge is once removed from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nests's Nurse Ratchett.  Characters like these are so self-satisfied with their type of oppression, often branded with a smiley face, that the audience cannot help but anticipate their downfall.In response to Umbridge's restriction on using magic, the Hogwarts students set up their own secret club where Harry, who has the most experience in battle, teaches his peers how to attack with and defend against magic.  After years of Harry being used as a game piece in a series of long cons, it's refreshing to see him and his fellow students actively prepare themselves against Voldermort and his minions.  Not only does this underground magic club help groom Harry into a leader, but it also heals rifts between Harry and his classmates who had come to doubt his warnings about Voldemort.Harry's preparation for the battles ahead does not stop with a secret student organization.  Dumbledore tasks Professor Snape with preparing Harry against mental incursions by Voldemort.  It is still unclear exactly what the connection between Harry and Voldermort is, but it results in a psychic connection between the two enemies that may be used as a weakness.  Snape's training takes on the form of torture, similar to those in the military who undergo different ""enhanced interrogation"" techniques in order to inoculate them when they are employed by the enemy.Snape has always been one of my favorite professors at Hogwarts, and it's not only because of Alan Rickman's commanding vibrato.  Even in the earlier installments, where the line between good and evil was much starker, Snape was a character who ultimately did the right thing despite whatever darkness lingered in him.  Here we are given a reason for why Snape is always in such a foul mood.  During one of their interrogation sessions, Harry turns his powers against Snape and discovers, hidden in his memories, that a much younger Snape used to be an object of teasing and torture for Harry's father.  Instead of demystifying the character, this bit of back story actually further connects him with Harry.  We understand that the two have a shared past, which extends before Harry was even born, and we now know both characters have similar demons festering inside of them.As Harry admits to his godfather, Sirius Black, he has an anger growing in him.  Sirius explains to Harry that there is no such thing as pure good and pure evil, that both exist within us and we must sort them out ourselves.  This is a particularly touching scene because not only does it showcase a family connection between Sirius and Harry, but it allows Sirius to explain that he comes from a family of purists who looked down on mudbloods, children who are gifted with magical abilities but one or more of their parents are not magical.  Sirius's speech to Harry can be viewed as defining the difference between the first two Harry Potter films and the subsequent, darker installments.The tighter structure of The Order of the Phoenix allies it with The Prisoner of Azkaban, which had a similar blockbuster feel.  At times, however, it becomes apparent that The Order of the Phoenix had to amputate parts of the book in order to fit the film within the relatively short (for a Harry Potter film, that is) running time.  There are many characters who are introduced but never fully positioned within the world.  Many of these characters are members of the Order of the Phoenix, and because they serve as Easter eggs for the true fan and to supply depth to the universe of Harry Potter, reminding us that much more is going on beyond the halls of Hogwarts, these characters add rather than subtract from the film.  (Although, in one awkward exchange a Goth looking witch tells Mad Eye Moody, without explanation, not to call her Nymphona for reasons that surely can only be deciphered by J.K. Rowling acolytes).  However, other characters who occupy more running time appear to be shoehorned into the proceedings.  Luna Lovegood, a witch who is a bit touched in the head, serves as a mirror to Harry's own troubled past, but she's lumped conspicuously into the story seemingly without reason.  Likewise, Helena Bonham Carter's turn as Bellatrix Lestrange, the cousin of Sirius Black, is too small a part for such a well recognized actress.  Both characters may be building towards something more important, but their inclusion here reminds the viewer that we are always receiving part of the story.Despite the consistent quality of the Harry Potter films, they will always be, in part, companion pieces to the original books.  The filmmakers are at once too deferential to the source material, afraid to discard with too much, and incapable of fully realizing the immensity of the books themselves.  The Order of the Phoenix is as guilty of this as the other films, but ultimately it showcases one of the most propulsive plots in the series and ends with the most exciting climax yet.  Perhaps it would be more than a tad greedy to ask for anything more."	4.0	Training a Battalion of Young Wizards and Witches	2010-11-14	2	1	1

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A5CWLQF6QO3CN	"Tso Haven Hei Wan ""Havenough Dupont Randall-B..."	"The fifth instalment of the Harry Potter series is not an easy read. It deals with death and loneliness and the ""age of nobody understands me"". Despite facing death for the first time in the fourth book, this is the first time Harry is facing the aftermath of death and learning how to deal with death itself. The theme was clear right from the beginning when he saw the ""winged creatures with bones on their bodies"" drawing the carriage and nobody except Luna, who had seen death, could see it.David Yates managed to capture all these very well in his vision of the Harry Potter world. It is dark all through and the loneliness of the boy wizard that creeps in from time to time does show that the audience should now be ready for something more epical and drastic coming. Book five is a bridging book of the series and it is not easy to please anyone. So is the film. Critics have not been easy on the movie itself but a more closely look to the book, and then you will be able to appreciate more about the movie. There were lots of details from the book that were left out because of the natural confinement of the movie medium itself, but it does keep a lot of the originalities inside. The rendenz-vous with Luna is more memorable as compared to the book, but the whole nerdiness of the character was gone. Luna became a creepy, calm but very interesting character and Evanna Lynch did a fair job, considering the substantial change to the character in the script. The importance of the Order itself was shifted in the movie. As a result they became side line story instead and all the relationships among the people in the Order became unimportant in the movie. So if you are up for the Order you might be disappointed. However, it seems like the new Order is formed under the Dumbledore Army is being the new theme of the movie. The passing of the baton became very important as compared to the book. The more mentioned character in the Order is undoubtedly Sirius Black but that is understandable, considering his pivotal role in the book itself. However, the way he showed up in the flame this time is different as compared to Goblet of Fire. That might be the sort of details producers need to look at - how can the same magic performed by the same person in the same space look completely different between the two movies?Daniel, Rupert and Emma gave a fair performance but really in this movie they didn't really shine. Daniel looks angry all the time. Yes, the character is supposed to be angry but not superficially with an angry face and just panting heavily with a few water drops on his face. If his performance as an actor in Equus receives critical acclaim, sure he should be able to deliver more in Half Blood Prince. But again, is Harry a demanding character to perform? The screen stealer is no doubt Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge. Her appearances showed a well interpretation of aggressive gentleness - and she is not shy to deploy that on her students. Emma Thompson brief appearances were still very enjoyable although in the book her character is more important than in the movie. But again, the movie is now more about the younger generation.The special effects are up to standard as usual but a lot of familiar things are back, e.g. the moving staircases and of course the centaurs. The battle at the Ministry is a well orchestrated end to the movie and the swift movements between the Death Eaters and the Order certainly are cool eye candies for the movie. The youngster also played out well as the successors of the Order for the future. The battle between the opposites - light and darkness, fire versus water, were well done, though a bit obvious. The score of the movie is spectacular and captures the emotion of the movie extremely well. That added a lot of substance to the movie itself. For the well, kissing scene, it is just really overrated. Maybe it is an impact for kids, but for adults, it is just another kissing scene.Squeezing the book into a 2 hours or so movie is not an easy task. David Yates sure did a good job for the book. The book itself was not an easy read, so the movie will not be an easy watch for a lot of people, especially if you are expecting a standard Harry formula of just imaginary fantasy, because the fantasy is over. What is in stall for the audience this time is some serious action that will cause the lives of a number of characters in the upcoming finale. The Potter movie has grown out of the kids premises and like all teenagers' coming of age, it is not easy to handle and appreciate."	4.0	A fair transition for the series.	2007-07-15	5	3	2

Stine	Having never read the Harry Potter books to compare the movie to, I thought this was a great movie. I hated the fourth one so much that it took me ages to finally see this one because I thought I wouldn't like it either. However, I thought Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was much better than The Goblet of Fire. It had much more feeling to it, the story was better, and it wasn't as dark and violent. It got me excited about the Harry Potter movies again.	4.0	A Good Harry Potter Movie (coming from someone who hasn't read the books)	2009-10-13	0	0	0

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	"I don't know why, but ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" the fifth installment of Harry Potter films is by far the shortest of the series. Considering the numbers of the characters and the events that happen to them, the film's 138 minutes is too short. It needs three hours and the content deserves that length.Plot thickens here. No more delightful Quidditch can be seen. In spite of the occasional comical moments and Harry's romance, the film's tone gets darker than ever and even Ron's mother looks more worried. If you remember what happened at the end of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" she should be more worried about her children. That means some scenes might be too scary for kids.New characters (and talent) enter the story - newcomer Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood is most impressive - and some regular characters like Draco Malfoy are almost forgotten. I don't know how many of you miss Draco, but with additional 20 or 30 minutes this kind of thing could be avoided. Helena Bonham Carter's villainous Bellatrix Lestrange is introduced a bit too abruptly in the story, which lessens the impact of the final battle scene and its consequences.The visuals themselves are fantastic as always, but director David Yates is no Alfonso Cuaron. The special effects such as Harry and friends flying over Themes River are, technically, just wizardly, but not imaginative. The scenes are beautiful, but no wicked humor of Shrunken Head. But it all depends on your taste. I just prefer different approach and that's all.The film should be longer by at least 20 minutes, but I believe there is a director's cut somewhere in Warner's studio.

This is the novel where Harry and his friends truly begin to grow up.  For this reason, the cut the movie producers decided upon hurt, mostly because they made many poor decisions in what to cut.  Cuts are necessary, but must be done intelligently.  However, the cuts are not the fatal flaw of the film.  No, that's the climatic battle with the Deatheaters.  Here is where we are supposed to truly glimpse the mortal danger Harry and his friends are in.  Instead, we get a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing.  Watching it, I came away with an overwhelming sense the Deatheaters were going easy on the kids, because they were kids.  You never feel they are actually in any real danger.

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A2OCJNB6B46OKP	"Underground Reborn ""gnome"""	When I first put down the fifth Harry Potter book I had told my friends that when the movie was made it was going to be amazing. 'Order of The Phoenix' was a real step up in the Harry Potter saga. A story that originated around magic spells and fairytales became a real world of war and politics. Harry Potter knew that this year at Hogwarts was going to be no different than the previous. Witnessing a fellow student die at the hands of his enemies the previous year things have gone from bad to worse. The Wizadering World has been torn between believers of the dark lords' return and those who just want to live in denial. Unfortunatly the second side is the side with all the power as the Ministry is trying to keep everyone in line including the children at Hogwarts. With a new teaching on the grounds insituting new rules to keep Harry's mouth shut, Harry and his friends are not going to take it lightly.This film was going to be a challenge for whomever took the directors chair. Small time director David Yates created a great film rich in the detail of the story. Eventhough a great amount of the books material was cut it was just like 'Goblet of Fire' There is a lot of pointless side story which really has no reference to the meat of the story and that is why you do not see those in the film. The characters have really come a long way acting wise. The children have really evolved since the begining and new commer Imelda Staunton nailed Umbridge. What David Yates did that was very different from the previous directors was that he made these characters real. With all the wizardry and magic there was a real sense of realisim through the diologue and the emotions expressed by the characters. Now with Yates signed on for the final 2 installments (3 technically due to the divison of Deathly Hallows) I am even more excited to see how the rest of this story emerges on to the big screen.	5.0	A Crucial Make Or Break For The Harry Potter Film Series (Part 5 of 8)	2008-08-26	0	0	0

So now, months after seeing a midnight showing, I am still in utter shock. I dont WANT to hate this movie because it is Harry Potter after all. But I cant but cringe whenever I think about it. Basically, they turned the longest book into the shortest movie. Appalling, horrendous, wrong. It was like a ridiculously abridged version of Order of the Phoenix. People around me in the theater were also aware of this as scenes jarred from one to another without flow or reason. If you have never read the book, you probably wound't notice just how much they cut out. Or changed. The changes were awful and unfortunetely, certain aspects that they either changed or left out are crucial to the final book. So I dont understand the reasoning. I could go on and on but I dont want to relive it..The one plus I do have is that the acting dramatically improved by the younger actors. I did notice it right away and am glad of that anyway. Oh and Umbridge was spot on. Well! Thats about it, really. I now have doubts about the 6th movie, being made by the same director and all...We shall see.Oh, also, the deleted scenes on the dvd are absolutely pointless. I mean, not 1 has any merit or importance to it. I at least hoped those would help out the movie in some way, but no, they sure didnt. I gave it 3 stars because although I dont hate the movie per se, I am quite dissapointed about it, and well, if you're a Harry Potter fan, you cant really hate it.	3.0	Incredibly dissapointed	2008-01-25	3	3	0

I took me a long time to be convinced to read the books, but I always loved the films. Order of the Phoenix is stylistically stunning in many ways, but lacks some character development needed to fuel the plots of the next two films. I can deal with no qwidditch, etc. but the lack of time spent with the characters in the order, the house elves, and Grimwald (sp?) place  give the film a stunted quality generally apparent whether one is a huge fan or not. Director David Yates has come in from TV feeling that the other films were too long...Prisoner of Azkaban is only 2.20...too long? Since when did a Potter fan want less. The fans who have not read the books will suffer most: not having any real affection for Tonks and Shacklebolt will leave them confused. Also, reacquaintence with Serious, Mad-Eye, and Lupin is definately necessary considering (SPOILER ALERT)the death of Serious and beyond. Not to mention the shame of not utilizing Gary Oldman and David Thewelis' considerable skills. Of course, I am buying it despite these critisisms and hoping David Yates takes to heart the desires of his audience. Less is more, but not when it comes to content.	3.0	Really good disapointment	2007-11-24	17	9	8

Also the director is differnt in this one and  here is not as operatic and gothic as in goblet of fire. The movie and book pretty much enter the xmen mode where you can sense this movie is the preparation for the big battle between the dumbledore army and the voldemort army in the next 2 books and movies. So its like a movie which sets the stage for a larger showdown. So although there is a showdown in the end, you know that this movie is a passage to the next and final one. The movie deviates from the end of the book and rightly so. The book did not have  dumbledore  returning for the final fight with Voldemort but in the movie he does return back. In the book he Vanishes when Cornelius Fudge attempts to arrest him to move him to Azkaban. The guys are all more grown up and look cooler. The costumes are nicer and chic.

Really, she should get a best-supporting actress nod or something for this - the only problem is, who can watch it?It seems to me that if you're making a fantasy film and you have a character who is this vile, you need to balance her out in some way, like with some more teen romance, or a nice game of quidditch, or whatever.  I know that the screenwriter and director had to make choices from the book when they wrote the screenplay, but they probably did not anticipate that Staunton's performance would be so menacing, dominant and overpowering.

When it comes to adapting a book into a movie, it's difficult to know what to cut and keep in. For ""Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix"" directed David Yates has streamlined Rowling's book in favor of the main plot. While it is missing some of the character of Rowling's book, it makes up for it with non-stop action and terrific acting particularly from Daniel Ratcliffe who has really blossomed as an actor in this film. Yates and the screenwriter Michael Goldenberg (""Contact"", ""Peter Pan"")manage to condense a thick novel into a shorter, action packed sequel. That means they sometimes have to introduce characters on the fly without much background on them but the performances by the actors help fill us in a bit as well as their actions on screen.Video & Audio:As if by magic we get a sharp, crisp and colorful transfer. Featuring moody cinematography (unlike the candy floss cinematography of the first two Potter films) ""Phoenix"" captures the mood of the novel quite well.You can hear all those spells with all their detail intact as the 5.1 mix makes nice use of the format putting effects around the various speakers as necessary. This is the second film liberated from John Williams' too cutesy themes (I love Williams but his score did not work well for the ""Potter"" films) and has one of the best scores as well. Nicholas Hooper's score sounds marvelous in its presentation here.Extras:""Phoenix"" is a bit light in the special features department. Well, that's not totally true, it's just that the special features aren't all that...special. We get 10 minutes of scenes that were cut from the film. Sometimes these are bits and pieces that just didn't fit into the film (and they didn't) other times they are extensions of scenes already in the film but cut for good reason (they overstayed their welcome).""Trailing Tonks"" features actress Natalia Tena (who plays Nymphadora Tonks in the film hence the title) giving us a tour of the studios and the sets.""Harry Potter and the Magic of Editing"" is short and to the point. Director Yates and editor Mark Day discuss how only minor edits can alter the pacing and feel of a film and gives us some brief examples.I've saved the biggest but not necessarily the best for last. ""The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter"" is an Electronic Press Kit in everything but name only. It's not bad it just could have gone more into depth about the challenges of condensing one of the bigger Potter books, reception from fans to the changes, etc.Fans may not be happy with the abridged version in the shortest Potter film yet but I found this to be entertaining and in the spirit of Rowling's book. I try never to compare books to films simply because one can handle multiple narratives while the other handles imaginative action better. Highly recommended even though the extras are a bit on the weak side and hey, it's the movie that matters after all.

Both HD-DVD and the Blu Ray disc contain VC1 1080p video. The only difference is the HD-DVD also contains the standard definition DVD on the reverse side of the disc. The Blu Ray picture is unbelievable in quality and is filmed in the film's original aspect ratio.  The audio is PCM 5.1 uncompressed and is an amazing experience and true to the theater going experience. It is one of the better 5.1 PCM tracks currently on Blu Ray.  However, it is unfortunate that Warner Bros didn't give the Blu Ray the same edge as the HD-DVD version with its  Dolby True HD track. Of course, it would have been even better if Warner Bros had provided a DTS Master Audio Track on both formats. We will just have to wait for the studio master feature to become more wide spread on both formats, including the use of the 7.1 channel sound.  The HD-DVD version goes par for par with the Blu Ray version in special features but neither are overly impressive. This is no surprise for anyone who has ever owned a Warner Bros DVD. The Blu Ray ultimately falls short of the HD-DVD in overall special features.  The HD-DVD version contains an exclusive Picture in Picture commentary and behind the scenes look at the making of the film that is not found on the Blu-Ray.

I was under the impression there were going to be alot of deleted scenes & what we got was uninteresting.  I guess I assumed there'd be good deleted scenes b/c the movie left out so much.Even though the trailer feel of the movie was alarming, the most frustrating part to me was how such delicious scenes from the book were completely alterred.  The beauty of the book was the mental drama Harry was going through as he's growing up.  The movie watered this down horribly.  What happened to the strong moments such as his snapping at Ron & Hermione about how they don't know what it's like for him.  And, oh my God, what they did to the incredible book scene of Harry trashing Dumbledore's office at the end!!

Pratt	The film adaptation of the fifth Harry Potter film is a fairly good rendition of the book.  Here is where we start to see the movies not quite do the books justice however.  Prior to this, in Years 1-4, the movies were able to follow the books and show a lot of the details quite well.  Now with the books getting bigger and the stories more involved, we start to see key elements from the book missing from the movies.For that reason, I can only really recommend this movie to HP fans, as someone who watches it without the literary exposure to the book may miss a lot and not really appreciate the pace of the story and the events which unfold.  Good movie for those who read the book, not so great for those who are not already familiar with what is taking place.	4.0	Pretty Good Film Version	2014-02-20	0	0	0
B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	A3HP9JNRHOA5CW	William James Taylor IV	While the original OOTP book was not the worst of the series (that honor goes to the 2nd book, COS, and from it COS the film is easily the worst of the HP films even though it featured the least amount of the appalling Emma Watson but did feature way too much Rupert Grint), reading OOTP was like sitting through a big budget movie that goes nowhere. OOTP as a book was long but didn't really have much of a plot. Oh, it sure did ridicule the government and offered a lot of teen angst moments, but the story was more less non-existent. Ironically, OOTP was the longest book yet it is the shortest of the HP films, perhaps WB's reaction to criticism of the first two films being too long & slow.Well, Daniel Radcliffe is still a fine Harry, better than his sidekicks anyway. Grint wasn't as annoying as he was in past films, but he has nothing to do and nothing funny to say (granted, Ron was nothing but an emotional punching bag for Harry by this point). Emma Watson as usual is just plain annoying, coming off as a spoiled school princess instead of a well meaning book worm.Imelda Stanton is well cast as the obnoxious Umbridge, and Evanna Lynch is spot on as Luna Lovegood. The lack of Sirius is a crime though, and some scenes didn't have enough emotion. Still, at least it doesn't drag on forever.The eye candy is glossy as always.	3.0	Phoenix Order	2007-12-28	2	1	1

B00005JPI2	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Two-Disc Special Edition)	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"Though undoubtedly a bit drawn out, the novel version of ""Order of the Phoenix"" does contain its share of epic moments.  I thought that this movie version would be an improvement, as it would be able to separate the ""wheat from the chaff"", so to speak, and keep the action flowing.  What actually happens, however, is that the movie never slows down enough to savor those great moments, instead pushing forward relentlessly from beginning to end.For a basic plot summary, ""Phoenix"" begins with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) defending himself at the Ministry of Magic after using a Patronus Charm to defeat some Dementors near Privet Drive.  Upon returning to Hogwarts, Harry discovers that the school is slowly being turned into a mouthpiece of Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) with the appointment of Delores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) as a central figure.  Soon, Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), & Hermoine (Emma Watson) get some first-hand experience dealing with the ""politics of magic"", so to speak.The film version of ""Phoenix"" is basically a class-A example of a movie not living up to the novel.  It is just a little odd for this series considering that all the previous movies were very favorably toward their books' source materials.  The trouble here is that director David Yates doesn't quite know when to ""slow down"" and savor the moment (or even what those right moments are).For example (spoilers ahead)...-Some very interesting material regarding why Harry must always stay with the Dursleys is completely excised.  This was a key portion of the book that really ties up some loose story ends.-Also gone is a very touching ""Weasley is our King"" Quidditch angle from the book.  Instead, Grint's Ron is given nothing to do in this one.-Umbridge is treated with a comical air instead of the malice she should personify.  in fact, her first appearances in the Hogwarts halls are set to a sort of music video montage totally unbecoming of what her character should be.-The final climactic battle featuring Dumbledore (Micheal Gambon) and Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) carries none of the gravitas of the novel (or even lives up to the Potter/Voldemort scenes at the end of ""Goblet of Fire).  It just falls flat.One thing that the movie does get right, however, is spending a least a bit more time (though still far less than the book) rounding out the auxiliary cast.  The Weasley Twins (James & Oliver Phelps), Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright), Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis), & Cho Chang (Katie Lueng) get more screen time than ever before, while newcomer Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) is a great new addition to the cast.Thus, while ""Order of the Phoenix"" isn't a terrible movie by any means, it is the first of the Potter movies to significantly be worse than its source-material novel.  Too many key moments are missing, while the ones that do show up aren't allowed to be savored like they should."	3.0	Never Fully Captures The Epic Moments From the Book	2013-06-11	2	1	1

I only liked ""The Chamber of Secrets"" out of all the Harry Potter films.  At this point, it's like sensory overload, and overdone.  It's just the same ol stuff, and the actors look like they're done, and they should be.  I love the way it was filmed, but if your not a big fan of Harry potter in general, the movies are pretty dull and boring.  It borders on pretentiousness, and the guy playing Harry potter needs to get over himself, you ain't all that honey!"	2.0	No Mo Potter	2007-12-24	4	0	4
