I think its soooo funny how the 3 witches, from the 1600's, are brought back to life in the 20'th century! I luv how they react to the firetruck, the bus, and the road (which they think is a black river), and the sprinklers when Max(Omri Katz) puts a lighter to it.(no, theres no smokeing in this movie) :>This is a very, very, very..., funny movie, and i watch it ALL THE TIME!!! I JUST LOVE IT!!!!!And you won't be waisting your money. IT IS A GREAT MOVIE!!!(i think i'll say that again!) IT IS A GREAT MOVIE!!!And i hope that someday they will have a sequel 2 it.

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	AADJXNY9HSKJF	Aaron	Thsi movie seemed to get a bad rap at the time of its release. I remember numerous people commenting on how stupid it is. However, I think that's unjust. The cast is a riot namely the three witches perfectly played by Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy. The plot revolves around these three witches coming back to life 300 years after being hanged. they then set off to take the lives of every child in Salem so they can live forever. As ludicrous as the plot seems, the three bumbling, wise-cracking and sometimes pitifully stupid witches are so fun on screen, that the plot isn't even really anything to focus on. And of course, Bette gets her chance to sing at an adult Haloween party, when at the same time she's cursing all of them to &quot;dance until they die.&quot; I always oddly find myself singing along. This movie is great fun not only on Halloween but year round.	4.0	Halloween Fun	2003-10-15	5	5	0

I saw this movie for the first time at a movie theater. It was wonderful. When it was available on vhs I bought it immediately, but I noticed that the supermarket scene with the Sanderson sisters had been left out. It was one of my favorite scenes of the movie and it was even pictured on the back cover of the box and referenced in the vhs. Even though that particular scene was edited out from the original theatrical film on the vhs, it was still worth the purchase. I do not know if the supermarket scene was restored when the film was released on dvd, but it would be great if it was. This was a great movie for Midler. She really played her part to the max. Parker and Najimy were exellent as well.	5.0	Great Midler Movie	2007-07-22	0	0	0

Okay, the plot wouldn't win a Pulitzer Prize, but for sheer fun and enjoyment, let Hocus Pocus transport you to a time and place where witches ruled and moms still impersonated Madonna in cone cupped bustiers.

The cast is absolute perfection, especially the witchy trio, and it's overall such a campy classic! Great acting, great effects (especially for an early 90s movie), great songs, sets, story, and phenomanal cast!Only negative is regarding the actual Blu-ray.This is such a cult classic movie with a huge fan base, and Disney really disappointed, especially since the film just had a big anniversary. No behind the scenes footage, no interviews, no deleted scenes, or ANYTHING! And all that extra footage DOES exist! Clips of deleted scenes and behind the scenes have been showed before on TV. Shame on you, Disney....But! The movie is amazing as always!	4.0	"Hocus Pocus is Wickedly Fun as Always! Blu-ray, However, is more bare ""bones"" than Billy the Zombie!"	2014-06-25	0	0	0

This  allows you to see more on the ends that are cut out on vhs's full screen format. The sound is fantastic 5.1 Surround Sound Dolby and, on my Bose system, it's wonderful. Bette's ""I'll Put A Spell On You""  and ""Sarah's Theme"" are so much more enhanced to hear. Also, Binx's  shadow is the pointer to the menu. If you move Binx to the  chapters, they are displayed on tombstones. It's about time we got it on dvd  even if Disney didn't enhance it with Entertainment Tonight's Making  of Hocus Pocus, that I saw just before the film came out, deleted scenes or even a trailer.  The film is definitly 5 stars. Due to Disney's lack of support with any extras, Disney gets a 1 star for insensitivity to the fans.

There's something for everybody: comedy, horror, romance, drama....etc. Anyway, Hocus Pocus is about 3 witch sisters from the 1600s during the Salem Witch Trial days.  After sucking the life out of Emily, Thackery's beautiful kid sister,  Thackery finds the home of the 3 witches in the woods (this is in the  1600s, of course) and the 3 witches (Winifred Sanderson, Sarah, and Mary)  catch Thackery in their house trying to rescue Emily and turn him into a  black cat forever. The witch sisters are caught by the townspeople and they  hang the sisters for killing Thackery.300 years later (or, in the  present day), a teenage boy named Max, his younger sister, Dani, and their  parents move to Salem, Massachusetts from Los Angeles. Max falls in love  with this girl in his class named Allison who's very rich. On Halloween,  his teacher tells her class the story of the 3 sisters who sucked the lives  out of every child to make themselves look younger and beautiful.Max  doesn't believe in the story at first. On Halloween night, he has to take  Dani trick-or-treating and they end up going to this large house that  happens to be the home of Allison, Max's crush. Dani believes in the story  about the 3 witches and when Max suggests going to the house of Winifred,  Sarah, and Mary, Dani doesn't want to go 'cause she believes in the  story.To prove that Max thinks he's right, they all go to the house  which is in the cemetary. They get there (which had been turned into a  meuseum) and find Thackery as the cat. Thackery tells them not to light the  black candle (which brings the witches back to life) but Max does, anyway.  And of course, the witches do come back to life.The witches now try to  suck the lives out of all the children to make themselves younger. Max,  Allison, and Dani have to stop the witches and destroy them before sun rise  or else they will suck the lives out of all the children and Thackery will  stay a cat forever.Hocus Pocus is a really funny and good movie. It  might not be an Oscar winning material, but it's very entertaining and  enjoyable. It's a movie that is good if you just want to kick back and  relax. The best time to see this movie is probably on Halloween (at night,  of course!) Hocus Pocus is one movie that everyone will surely enjoy!

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A19ZN6802UJZJZ	Bailey	I bought this movie from Wal-Mart yesterday, to begin with.I'd seen the movie on TV before, and whenever I seen it, it was just average. It wasn't an above-the-top Halloween movie. What I didn't know was that what I was actually watching on the TV was a watery version of the movie. It was run through a supreme filter. I like to use the image of making coffee. The movie is the coffee grinds in the coffee pot that the water comes through. They sit there and the water goes through, but all that comes out is the FLAVOUR of the grinds without the grinds themselves. That perfectly paints the picture in this case, actually. They filtered it so you could get the TASTE of the movie, but you wouldn't get the real bulk of the movie.I realize now, being the owner of the DVD, that I horribly underrated this film. I didn't really know that the movie was what it was because of those superfilters for the movie.Basically, I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you're hating on the movie because you saw it on TV, get the DVD because it is a lot better when you see the movie unedited, as it was intended to be seen.	5.0	Hocus Pocus	2012-12-22	1	0	1

However, if camp, fun and laughs is what you're after then give it a go.  It's just scary enough for the entire family, so you won't have to put the children to bed first.  In fact, children will identify with the heroes.  Please do, however, explain the truth about Witches to them before you watch it so that they'll understand this is FICTION.Even though it's so bad for the Craft, I still love it.

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ	"Barry ""Barrybgb"""	This movie is criminally underrated. First of all, the film wasn't the flop people think it is. It did over 45 million at the box office. Okay, that settled, let's dig in. Three witches from the 1800's are hung for taking the souls out of children in Salem, Mass. Present day Salem, a lonely teen resurrects the three hags accidentally while visiting their old cottage that has turned into a mini museum. The witches, well cast and perfectly played by Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy, set out on Halloween night to take the souls from the children as they trick or treat. The three lead actresses are perfect in their roles. They really bring them to life. This is a fun, light hearted film that the whole family can enjoy. The setting and decoration is perfect and has that great Halloweeny feel. There's also a funny cameo by Penny Marshall and Garry Marshall as husband and wife(but who are real life brother and sister in case you didn't know). This is a real great vehicle for Bette Midler. She fits perfectly. You'll also recognize Thora Birch(American Beauty)as the little sister. The film is a wonderful family treat that will delight and entertain the whole family.	4.0	A Halloween Treat For Everyone	2001-09-16	74	68	6

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A1Y1IMKX8ZRV4Y	Ben Adam	It's hard to believe this movie wasn't an immediate success, because it is so enjoyable and is so well acted. The story begins in Old Salem with the execution of the Sanderson Sisters, three witches who, at the time of their execution, cast a spell to ensure that they will come back to life one Hallowe'en when a virgin lights the black candle. Enter one hapless teenage boy (Omri Katz) from California who has just moved to Salem, is not so happy that he has, and upon exploring the Sanderson house, lights the candle, and the adventure begins. The three witches, played by Bette Midler, Kathy Nijimy, and Sarah Jessica Parker, plot to lure the children of the town to concoct a potion to keep themselves young forever and thus live on while the one who brought them back to life, together with his sister and girl friend try to stop them and undo the spell.While the story sounds not so much fun on paper, the action on the screen keeps the audience spellbound. The tension remains high, and there's plenty of entertainment along the way, including one song performed by Bette Midler at the Hallowe'en Ball. Great script with lots of unforgettable lines.

When it comes to my favorite childhood Halloween movies my top three were always Hocus Pocus, Casper Meets Wendy, and Halloweentown II. After just watching HP it's easy to remember why it always made the top of the list. The movie is funny and I feel had a great cast. The cinematography is beautiful for a Disney movie and the story is wonderful. Great for all ages but watching it as a child is nothing short of magical.

Where you have a day at the beginning of the month where you watch Halloween movies, eat some early candy and pick out your costume and have the whole month to make it!) and as a kid it scared the pee out of me! But as I got older I really started to get the jokes and it was less scary and far more enjoyable and now as an adult I love it!The transfer to blu-ray was excellent! The picture is brighter and crisper, and the sound is ten fold better! My one beef with the whole thing is that there is no freaking bonus features! But for the price, getting a blu-ray and DVD of a great movie I can't complain!All in all the movie is just as awesome as I remember it being! I would highly recommend this movie for everyone!

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A1YB29BIDULEYE	"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch"""	"Along with ""Clue,"" this is what I consider one of the greatest Halloween movies ever made. It starts with the death of 3 witches (Winifred, Sarah, and Mary). Also, Zachary gets turned into a black cat by them after he unsuccessfully tries to save his sister Emily. We then move to a present day classroom in Salem where a class has heard about what happened. Did what we see really happen, or was it just an acted out story the teacher was telling? GREAT AMBIGUITY! Max doesn't believe the story, which makes him somewhat of an outcast. He seems interested in Allison; she is not exactly rude to him, but she doesn't seem overly interested in forming a relationship with him either. We also see that Max has some problems with his younger sister Danielle. (He doesn't want to take her trick or treating.) But they patch things up, and they run into Allison. They decide to visit where the 3 witches they learned about in class died. In a dramatic, but also hilarious fashion, the 3 witches are resurrected, and they plan their revenge on Salem. This movie is great that while the 3 witches are unquestionably evil, they carry a charm that makes them hilarious and lovable despite. Basically, they want to kill enough people so that they can make a potion that will enable them to live forever. (Another thing that is so funny is that they are trying to take over a world they don't know. They don't know what a bus is; they think fire men are witch hunters; they think the trick or treaters are real monsters, etc.) In an especially hilarious moment, Winifred walks into a kitchen and says: ""Behold! A torture chamber!"" Allison, Max, and Danielle, along with the black cat Zachary are sometimes uneasy allies, but they are determined to stop the witches from taking over Salem. Overall, there is a phenomenal combination of horror, suspense, and comedy. Even characters with small parts like Danielle's parents make the most of their roles. (Danielle's mother is humiliated when she tries to explain an R rated costume she wore to an adult party. Of course, she didn't expect Danielle to find her there!) There is also a great climax with a touch of tragedy.  Probably one of the best things about this movie is that often we are not sure as to whether we are watching a horror movie or a comedy. But it's all Halloween! And of course with Bette Midler as the head witch, there is a great song in the middle (which in this case turns out to be a spell). If you love Halloween, this movie is a MUST!"	5.0	Outstanding Halloween Comedy, Horror, and Suspense	2008-09-25	2	1	1

Upon awakening, the three witches, who are sisters, instantly set about reliving their lives and causing plenty of trouble for the kids and the rest of the town in a 'bewitching' and uproarious manner.

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A1CEQ9HZCE7KQJ	Bruce Clark	"Okay I have to admit this film has a interesting plot (witches return to Salam after 300 years), and some great special effects but the major cast 'sucked' the wind out of the film and that was why it failed at the theater. The ""Divine Miss M"" was attempting to switch from her Gay following to her Disney following which left both group's lost. SJP had not yet developed her S&TC; following so she she thumped about 'smelling children'. And the last member (KN) which I guess was the ""funny one"" of the troop always got left out: i.e. having to ride a vacuum instead of a broom - ha, ha the first time. I felt like I was watching a remake of the 3 stooges. If I wanted to watch the 3S I would buy 3S and not some disney remake.I felt sorry for the kids and some of the adults - both were really cute but were just overshadowed by the 'big stars'."	1.0	Are we watching the same movie??????????	2009-10-07	57	1	56

However, as a purchase be forewarned - if you have a widescreen TV this will not conform to the shape, as it is NOT ANAMORPHIC.  It will show up as a box inside a box.  So if you plan on only viewing on a widescreen TV, I can't recommend it.  You can zoom, but the picure quality suffers.

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A29IPPSNCCLDRQ	Catie	I'm a 16 yr old who still watches Disney(So sue me, I hate MTV and the Pop rage). I never knew this movie was in theatres until I read these reviews! I just finished watching Hocus Pocus on TV tonight and thought I'd look it up on Amazon to see if it were on DVD/VHS. This movie is a classic, and I watch it every time it comes on. I have the soundtrack, which consists of like 2 songs, on Kazaa Media. It's the greatest halloween movie of the 90s for kids, and even teenagers, because I know alot of kids at school like it as well. Hope this review will help someone out! I would recommend this movie to anyone-my dad says it's one of the few things SJP did that was decent acting, lol!	5.0	Awesome	2003-11-10	19	18	1

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	AE42JLYPXUI45	"Chad DeFeo ""(ChandlerBingFan)"""	Halloween has never been this hilarious. Disney has always had a way with making great family movies, but HOCUS POCUS just tops all famiy movies.On October 31st, 1693 in the small town of Salem, Massachutsets, three witch sisters: WINIFRED SANDERSON (played by Bette Midler), SARAH SANDERSON (played by Sarah Jessica Parker), & MARY SANDERSON (played by Kathy Najimy) have kidnapped a little girl by the name of EMILY BINX. Her brother, THACKERY BINX (played by Sean Murray) has followed them to their little house, hidden deep in the woods. Sipping a potion they have made especially for her, Thackery appears and tries to save his little sister, but he is too late, for this potion has brought Emily's life force, where they suck out her life, which turns the Sanderson sisters from old to young. As punishment for stumbling upon the sisters and nearly foiling their plan, Winifred and her sisters transform Thackery into a black cat for all eternity. At that moment, the villagers of Salem, led by Thackery and Emily's mother and father, grab the sisters and ready them to be hung in front of the Salem townfolk. At that moment, Winifred's book of evil spells and potions lets it be known, silently, that on Halloween Night, a virgin shall resurrect the witches. After Winifred informs the town of her curse, they are hanged and killed.It is now October 31s, 1993, Halloween, 300 years after the Sanderson sisters were killed. There is a new kid in town named MAX DENNISON (played by Omri Katz). He has moved to Salem with his mother and father (played by Charles Rockett and Stephanie Faracy), and his little sister, DANI (played by Thora Birch) from L.A. Max is having trouble adjusting to the small town of Salem. After leaving school, Max has a little conversation with the beautiful ALISON (played by Vanessa Shaw), who Max goes to school with. Max has crush on Alison, for Alison likes Max too, but is a little shy. On his way home, Max runs into two bullies, who rob him of his sneakers, putting more of a bitterness in Max.Two or three hours later, Max and Dani head out to go trick or treating. They have a brief argument, but Max, feeling sorry for treating Dani badly, makes up with her. They head into a huge house. They find that this huge house is the residence of Alison. The three talk for awhile and find that Alison's mother used to own the Sanderson Sisters' Museum, which was actually the Sanderson's little old house. Max thinks it's a good idea to go. The three head out to the house where Alison gives them a tour. They find Winifred's book locked in a glass case, where Max finds the black-flamed candle. The candle, when lit on Halloween night with a full-moon in the black sky, will awaken the Sanderson sisters. His stupidity leads Max into lighting the candle, where Winifred, Sarah, and Mary return. They have a brief outting with the sisters, where Max tells Alison and Dani to head out, where he'll catch up. As he leaves, he runs into...Thackery Binx. Turns out Thackery is still in the form of a cat, but he has the ability to talk. Binx decides to help out the kids, where has Max steal Winifred's book.The Sanderson sisters fly out to find the kids and Binx. They are at a nearby cemetery, where Binx shows the kids the grave of a man named BILLY BUTCHERSON (played by Doug Jones). Billy was Winnie's boyfriend, but she found him one day fooling around with Sarah, forcing Winifred to kill Billy. Binx then shows the kids the grave of his beloved sister, Emily, where tells them of what happened to her. But at that moment, the sisters arrive and wreck more havoc, including resurrecting Billy Butcherson.The kids arrive at the townhall party, where they try to tell Mr. and Mrs. Dennison about this, but the sisters show up and break into a song and dance, putting a spell on all of the party to DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! UNTIL YOU DIE! The kids escape into the high school and try torching the sisters, but they escape as the kids sleep at Max and Dani's house. Alison and Max head downstairs, ready to walk Alison home, but they hear noise from upstairs. They find the book in missing and find that the sisters have Dani. They explode on out through the roof and head out on their way. Mary and Winifred head on home, where Sarah, through singing, has all the children of Salem in a trance, where they will head over to the Sanderson house to have their lives sucked by the sisters. At that moment, Alison remembers what Winifred had said just before they took Dani with them. She tells Max that Winifred had said the candle's magic will soon be spent and Dawn approaches. This means that the black-flamed candle only brought the witches back for this one Halloween Night. They have to steal the lives of children to in their youth and remain immortal. If they cannot do that in time, they will explode to dust when the sun rises.As the sisters try to make Dani drink the potion, Max enters and saves Dani. But Winifred realizes that he has tricked the sisters again, where they head out after Alison, Dani, and Max back to the cemetery. The kids run into Billy Butcherson, but they find he only wants to help the kids defeat the sisters. Winifred actually kills Binx in the process, but they cannot get the kids in time, for the sun has come up and turned the sisters into dust. The witches are dead, Thackery's soul is free, where he is reunited with Emily.This movie was a really fun-filled movie for all kids. Some images maybe a little frightening, but your children will really enjoy this film. I have enjoyed this film since I was eight years old. A definite family classic.	5.0	Hocus Pocus (1993)	2006-01-01	3	2	1

My grandmother used to record it on VHS for me every year(it would always end up lost or broken). I love halloween and the movies that comes with that time of year and this is definitely top 3! To me this is more than a movie now. My first cat was a 5 day old black kitten born on October 16 of 2007. He was abandoned by his mom so i bottle feed and cared for this kitten like my own child. from the moment i looked at him he melted my heart and i named him Thackery Binx, Binx for short. ;) HE was more everything unfortunately he passed in 2010 during a very bad winter. His sweet caring mature and lovable personality was just like the characters. It great to watch this movie and remember him along with my childhood.	5.0	More than a holiday movie	2013-09-09	1	1	0

It is just another little harmless Disney gem that was meant to entertain. And boy, did it EVER!PLOT SUMMARY: The story of ""Hocus Pocus"" revolves around the three evil witches--Winifred (Bette Midler), Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker), and Mary (Kathy Najimy) Sanderson of Colonial Salem, Massachusetts. They are hung to death by the townspeople after they supposibly killed a young girl and her older brother, Thackery Binks. But in reality, they sucked the life out of the young girl to make themselves younger and more beautiful, and turned Thackery into a black cat. Right before they died however, they promised the townspeople that they would come back to life and suck all the lives out of children in Salem when a virgin lights the black candle in their home. Flashfoward to preasent day, Salem. Max Dennison (Omri Katz) is a rebellious teenager who recently moved to the town with his family from Los Angeles. On Halloween night, Max is forced to take his kid sister, Dani (a young Thora Birch), out trick-or-treating. While out (and after being bullied by some neighborhood guys), Max and Dani arrive at a very large house. It happens to be the home of Allison (Vinessa Shaw), Max's new crush. In school that day, Max and Allison's teacher told them the story of the Sanderson sisters, which Max didn't believe. To impress Allison, Max suggests that they go to the home of the Sanderson sisters so he can light the black candle and prove that the story is false. Both Allison and Dani, who strongly believe in the story, agree to go. Once at the Sanderson house, Max is about to light the candle when they are stopped by a strange black cat who can talk--it's Thackery Binks, who warns Max not to light the candle. Max, however, ignores Thackery and lights it anyway, bringing the sisters back to life so they can finish their sinister scheme. Now, it's up to Max, Allison, Dani, and Thackery to finish the sisters off once and for all.MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: I found this film extremely hilarious and entertaining as a kid, and I still do today. Excellent acting performances by the entire cast--Midler, Parker, and Najimy are particular standouts, as well as Katz. The special effects are great, and there's a wonderful storyline. The music is haunting, too. Wish I could find the soundtrack CD. Though slightly predictable, it is still a lot of fun. The DVD lacks though, big-time. Only drawback--should have added special features, at least a trailer or commentary track. If you want thrills and laughs on Halloween, look no further than ""Hocus Pocus""! The DVD is available in wide screen format.I highly recommend ""Hocus Pocus"".Score:100/100A+"	5.0	Terrific Halloween Disney fun!	2003-02-05	2	0	2

I'll watch this one again, and laugh just as much. The unsuspecting, unbelieving town of Salem doesn't know what it's in for as the witches seek to restore their youth and powers. The town's only hope lies in a savvy cat (really a young boy they'd cursed 300 years ago)who helps two young teens and a child find a way to fend off evil. There's a few 'harsh' parts that are probably not intended for children under eight, but the film is also full of light-hearted fun.Chrissy K.

I think the movie itself is hilarious and can see why it's a cult classic, but some people do find it ridiculous.

The transfers clean up is great, no dirt or scratches that I could see. It is great improvement over the non anamorphic DVD that has been out for many years.Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy, and Sarah Jessica Parker as the three witches are great. The highlight of the movie.No extras, kind of a bummer.Over all I give it 3 stars for the soft, but good transfer and no extras.

I was just renting it every year, usually in VHS format, because it is difficult to find it on DVD.  I finally found it on DVD, and I am glad that I can watch it whenever I want.  I am 27 years old, and I still love this movie.  There are some really good actresses in this movie, and the storyline is very interesting.  The movie is fun and mystical, and it really gets you excited about the fall weather and Halloween right around the corner.  I give this movie two thumbs up!	5.0	Great Family Movie	2010-10-07	1	1	0
6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A239PPUVV8O0U0	D. A. Reed	"I think I first saw this around 1994, forgot about it but stayed in the far recesses of my mind (mostly the sight of Kathy Najimy flying a vacuum) and then saw it again in the summer of 1998, causing it to now be one of my favorite movies. The teens/kids acting ability in this movie ranges from sub-par (Shaw and on-and-off again with Katz) to obnoxiously bad (Birch). The two ""bullies"" are your quintessential '90s bullies, complete with '90s lingo (tubular). So the main focus on why this is one of my favorites are the three leads; Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker (who hasn't aged well in my opinion) and Kathy Najimy. Midler (probably my favorite) plays Winifred as the more serious of the three but is pretty funny in her own right (most of her funny lines come from her interactions with her sisters) but she can pose a serious threat when needed. She's the one with the most power, being able to cast spells and fire lightning bolts from their fingertips (someone was watching Star Wars when they wrote this, though some person in cinema history might've fired lightning from their fingertips before the Emperor). And of course being the star of the picture, the Divine Miss M gets her own musical number, singing a reorchestrated ""I Put A Spell On You"". And she wears my favorite color, so no complaints. Parker's character Sarah is the idiot of the group. She's also the sexiest of the group and is positively crazy over any man she sees. Her power is a siren song to lure the children to the cottage. And what a song it is. ""Come Little Children"" is a beautiful song but can also feel menacing and haunting at the same time. Najimy is plump Mary, the most level-headed of the group and has an interesting taste in hairdos. Like Midler, she also has her funny moments (one of my favorites being after Winifred explains what they must do before the sun rises). Her power is being able to sniff out children, which comes across as weird. I mean its useful for what the witches' do, but its a shame she couldn't get a more interesting power. Overall, a satisfying movie, fit perfectly for Halloween. And if you'll notice the name of the director, its the same man who would destroy the musical genre with the dreaded High School Musical, this film probably being the only good nostalgic one he's ever done."	5.0	Trick or Treat	2009-10-02	2	2	0

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A1H08N0SONUW2A	"Davey Williams ""davey williams"""	Hocus Pocus is one of those films that didn't have much of a life at the box office, but which has become a Halloween staple in video form.  Hocus Pocus' has a lot going for it - including a well developed plot, likable characters, the acting talents of Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy - not to mention Omri Katz and an early appearance by Thora Birch (of American Beauty fame).  It even includes a rather fitting musical rendition of &quot;I Put A Spell On You&quot; by Midler.  But Hocus Pocus' greatest strength is perhaps that it remains a great Halloween flick for younger audiences.  It isn't to terribly scary, and I don't think anyone over the age of 15 will be holding onto their seats too tightly, but it remains a little creepy for the elementary set, who, after all, might want a little scare on Halloween, but aren't ready for the likes of 'Rosemary's Baby'.The story revolves around Max Dennison(Omri Katz), who, having recently moved to Salem from Southern California, is feeling a little out of place and put off by all of the Halloween celebrations in America's first 'terror town'.  Having few friends, he is resigned to spending Halloween night taking his spunky and well spoken little sister, Dani (Thora Birch), trick-or-treating. They meet up with Max's new found crush, Allison, who tkaes them on a whirlwind tour of Salem's world famous witch museum - legened to be the former residence of the Sanderson Sisters.  To make a long story short, Max lights the black flame candle on All Hallows Eve, thereby bringing Winnie, Mary and Sarah Sanderson back from the dead, who must capture the lifeforces of the town's children before the sun rises or be turned to dust.  A scary, witty, and sometimes funny romp through nighttime Salem ensues.While perhaps not the best film ever made, Hocus Pocus is an entertaining movie that stands as a great family Halloween staple.  For anyone with kids or a Disney video collection, Hocus Pocus is a must.	4.0	The 'Divine Ms. M' Shines in Delightful Disney Gem	2001-02-19	2	0	2

It has been vastly underrated and I can't understand why. It has everything you could possibly ask for in a family-oriented Halloween movie and I love the fact it's so down-to-earth. No cheesy, overblown, do-gooder messages like you see in most family movies these days. Instead, it's a bus load of fun!The acting is superb and you won't find a Halloween movie with a better Halloween ""feel"" to it, from colorful autumn leaves all around town to the warm glow of Jack-O-Lanterns sitting on inviting porches, and of course the songs ""I Put A Spell On You"" and ""Come Little Children"" are 100% captivating (in more ways than one - no spoiler).No matter what age you are (I'm in my forties), you'll have a blast watching this. Of course, I recommend it most for October viewing with popcorn in hand and no light in your house except maybe a Jack-O-Lantern candle and of course the TV screen.

But despite the PG-rating, there are some things parents might want to know before showing this to their children.The language - Many of the characters swear, mostly referring to hell, and condemning people to hell. There are some expletives using the name of diety, too.References to the occult - The three witches worship Satan, glorify evil, conjure up the dead, and worst of all - they suck the life out of a young girl in the opening scenes of the movie. Sometimes it feels quite evil. There are some gruesome images, too. The witches use human body parts in their potion and their spellbook is covered with human skin. The plot revolves around stealing the souls of children.References to sex - Quite a big deal is made of the main character's status as a virgin. As is true with most teen movies like this, he's embarassed by being a virgin, and some people can't believe a boy his age could still be a virgin. His mother wears a Madonna costume on halloween, emphasizing the trademark pointy bra. He and his little sister both call attention to his girlfriend's breasts. Reference is made to the witches' infidelity, and one witch (Sarah Jessica Parker) hits on everyone she can.Overall, the movie is OK, but it didn't leave me with a good feeling, and there are better movies to let my kids watch.	3.0	A Word of Caution for Parents	2010-10-20	8	2	6

Most of them give a good picture of what to expect in this early 90s film.  However, most of the recent and highly read reviews leave out a few very important factors for parents to consider before letting your kids watch this bewitching tale;-Bette Midler says ""Da#n"" about 15 times.  If you don't mind your kids hearing that repeated with great vigor, start the movie.-A key ingredient to releasing the witches from the ""Dark Beyond"" is a ""VIRGIN"".  This gets mentioned about 5 or 6 times (at least).  If you don't have a problem explaining that to your kids (or making up a lie) then, by all means, start the movie.-There is mataphysical violence (kids getting the life sucked from them, zombies with their heads and fingers coming off and mouth sewn shut, teans being zapped by lightning bolts).  Not particularly offensive, but a bit intense for some kids.  If your kids really have a grasp of reallity and don't get creeped out too easily, start the movie.I watched this right after I put my kids to bed.  I, personally enjoyed this film.  I really have nothing bad to say about it. Great picture and sound.  No extras.  However, I have decided that my 7-year-old daughter would not handle this too well, so I'm glad I pre-viewed it.Great viewing for Halloween, but not for my kids...  ...yet."	4.0	"""Fun for the whole family""?...  ...Not quite."	2005-11-01	5	2	3

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A1X4P6CN08U57A	FicktionPhotography	Hocus Pocus is one of those movies where you watch it once and it becomes a Halloween tradition for many years to come.  When the Sanderson Sisters from old Salem are reincarnated back into their former selves after being hanged for being witches, the modern day 1990s Salem is in for a Halloween they will never forget.The Sanderson Sisters, played by Sarah Jessica Parker, Bette Midler, and Kathy Najimy, are after children.  They need their life force to remain young and beautiful.  This, of course, doesn't leave the children in good sorts.  When they are first introduced they are in historical Salem where they are hanged after consuming the life force of a young girl.  Her older brother, Thackery Binks, in his attempt to save her, gets transformed into a black cat that is cursed with immortality.  He takes it upon himself to guard the Sanderson Sister's abandoned house for 300 years.  Until, unfortunately, Max, his sister Dani, and his love interest bring the sisters back to life.The movie is hysterical, mostly centering around the naivete of the sisters three centuries later, and it is a good watch for people of any age.	5.0	Hilarity Incarnate	2013-12-04	0	0	0

Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy are wonderful as three witches resurrected on Halloween night in Salem Massachusetts. They also happen to be sisters and when their spell is broken they return to the town that sentenced them to their would be demise on this earth. It is an entertaining film, a funny film, but it has its dark moments. I like the set designs in this movie and John Debney's score. It really captures the ghoulish goings on Halloween night.

Filled with great laughs and Disney-style suspense, it really is the epitome of a seasonal classic. Sometimes, when it's not even Halloween, I still watch it. My favorite character in this movie is Binx, a black cat that's actually a teen boy who's been cursed. But enough of that, don't confuse this movie for the one with Eddie Murphy.

In regards to movies like The Rocketeer and now Hocus Pocus, they seem to not care about these films too much. While I love this movie and watch it every Autumn, this release is somewhat disappointing. Granted this movie is not some sort of artistic masterpiece of cinema, it's probably one of the, if not the best, Halloween movie you can get that isn't a horror film. The transfer is pretty clean, hardly any pops or scratches, the natural film grain is still visible which is nice, and colors are vibrant and detail is good with minimal soft edges. As other reviewers have stated, there are no special features which is total balls. If you love this movie, get it on Blu-Ray because this is the best it's gonna look for awhile I'm afraid.	5.0	The best it's gonna look	2012-09-21	4	4	0

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A2HVL790PBWYTU	"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read"""	"Halloween around the corner, and so can these cinematic classics be far behind: THE EXORCIST, HALLOWEEN, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET... and HOCUS POCUS? Well, okay, HOCUS POCUS isn't quite regarded as a vintage spinetingler, but I saw this when I was younger and more impressionable - and imprinting must've set in - because I sort of dig this movie. And this in spite of my not being a fan of Bette Midler.This is a Disney venture, so while the film flirts with spooky, it doesn't really come close to giving up legitimate scares. Bette Midler takes center stage as the oldest of three sister witches, the Sandersons, plying their witchy trade back in 17th Century Salem, Massachusetts. In the midst of sucking the life force from a young girl, the Sanderson sisters are caught out by the outraged townspeople and promptly hanged. But not before Winifred (Midler) casts a last-second spell.300 years pass, and it's now the present (or, at least, 1993). The Sanderson sisters have become an urban legend, their alarming tale recounted down the centuries on many an armchair on All Hallow's Eve. Teen newcomer Max scoffs at all this, maybe because he's just moved from hip and jaded Los Angeles and he's just cool like that. Max is one of those irritating kids I've grown to dislike very much. He's here pretty much because the film needs a plot device to bring back the witches. Max is one of those surly alienated teens who'll do exactly what he's cautioned not to do. Trying to impress the rich local teen hottie, he lights the Black-Flamed Candle on Halloween night, the one single act which could resurrect the Sanderson sisters. So the daughters of darkness are back, and they're still looking to inhale the life forces from children. And the annoying Max, his likable younger sister, and the rich local teen hottie are all that stand between blah blah blah.HOCUS POCUS has become a cult flick over the past years. It certainly gets its share of airplay on the Disney Channel. There's enough of what could make little kids shiver here (Midler brings just enough malice to her role), and yet that's mitigated by Sarah Jessica Parker's cute dimbulb character (even if she does like to munch on bugs) and Kathy Najimy's irrepressibly cheery, child-sniffing performance. Much of the humor comes from the Sandersons being confounded by and trying to adapt to their new environs. Nothing underscores this more than that scene in which the Sanderson sisters think they've just met Satan. And, by the way, it's a bit disturbing having brother and sister Garry (dressed as Satan) and Penny Marshall playing an old married couple. But it's this sense of disorientation on the sisters' part which gives the kids a fighting chance, as Max comes up with several trick-'em-sideways ploys. He's annoying but, dammit, he's plucky, too.Bette Midler gets a chance to bust a tune, singing her own rollicking rendition of ""I Put A Spell On You."" Sarah Jessica Parker is ethereal as she sings a snippet of the haunting ""Come, Little Children."" I really wanted to hear more of that song.HOCUS POCUS having been released in 1993, its special effects are understandably no match for the fancy stuff in, say, the Harry Potter flicks. But it's not that bad for its time. Plus there's Thackery Binx, the talking colonial black cat.How much do I like this movie?  Enough to have that one incantation memorized, the one that transformed Thackery into an immortal feline: ""Twist the bones and bend the back. Trim him of his baby fat. Give him fur black as black Just. Like. Thisssss..."" Why, that's practically Shakespeare-like."	4.0	"""Let's light this sucker and meet the old broads."""	2009-10-08	0	0	0

Come on, Disney!...why the hold?I was 9 years old when I first saw this movie and my sister was 8. We handled it extremely well then.

Hocus Pocus has always been high on my family viewing list, mainly for the crazy story line and the amazing humor of Bette Midler.  I've curled up with my children on the opening credits, set deep in history, where the three evilly inclined sisters cause so much havoc in their small town. Bette Midler and her overbite, Sarah Jessica Parker and her ok-so-I'm-a-witch-but-I-have-a-weakness-for-boys-and-I'm-dumber-than-dirt, and Kathy Najimi and her vacuum cleaner take the fear out of the entire movie.  The family laughed at the hilarity, rooted for a 'black cat', and giggled over the undead.Despite the humor, the story line might be a little too intense for very young children.I love this film and so do my children, while they run around the house screaming AMOK!

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A2XPG4JOP6YVCH	Italygin	First let me say that the 2 star rating is for the Blu-ray combo pack, not the film. As Disney well knows now that this film has become a cult classic as well as one of the most watched Halloween flicks on tv every year. Yet once again we get a bare bones release. And a extra copy of the DVD released back in the early 2000's. The transfer of the movie to blu-ray looks nice, clean and a little more colorful. But barely. I was really hoping for deleted scenes(which there are plenty), behind the scenes and maybe some interviews. But Disney completely dropped the ball. Maybe someday they'll get a clue.Also a heads up to people purchasing &#34;The Muppet Christmas Carol&#34;blu-ray as it will not feature the full cut of the film that a previous DVD had.

Nonetheless, this fact went over my head the first few times I watched this film (I was in grade school), but just goes to show that there are multiple levels for all ages. I still watch this every year around late October and finally decided to just buy it instead of DVRing the ABC family version. I've yet to meet anyone who doesn't enjoy this film, and it makes a great gift for fall birthdays.	5.0	Halloween classic	2012-12-20	0	0	0
6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A3TATXC9LR4IMW	ivoryodessa	What can I say about 'Hocus Pocus'? Only that it has been a movie that I watch not only every October, but every other time of the year when I'm feeling sad, happy, or just really nostalgic. And I don't know what's taken me so long to get the DVD, because for the past 10 years or so I've been watching the old VHS tape that I recorded from 1998 (which I will still keep of course because it has the old Disney Channel commercials- oh, sweet nostalgia), but I guess better late then never. And although I don't know what person in their right mind could not like this movie, I know that there are some people out there who pick on it because it was a box office flop with a campy/corny atmosphere making it incapable of being a quality movie. And the critic ridicule is completely justified because all of those things are true. But the fact of the matter is...I DON'T CARE! And neither should anyone else. I will defend this movie till the bitter end because it was a viable part of my childhood, and reminds me of a time when life wasn't quite so complicated, and I still believed in magic, and Halloween was one of the best times of the year. So if you haven't seen this movie, (But honestly, who hasn't seen this movie by now? The 20th anniversary (2013) is just around the corner for crying out loud...)DO NOT listen to the critics! Watch it because it is a fun Halloween movie that will entertain you for about 90 min or so and may just take you back to your own childhood memories of Halloween. Like I said, I don't like this movie, I love it.P.S The order came on the estimated delivery date. Good job Amazon!	5.0	I don't like this movie, I LOVE this movie	2011-08-22	2	2	0

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI	JAMES MCCORMICK	"4 Stars =Classic""Hocus Pocus"" is a children's Halloween story about the Sanderson sisters, Witches, Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, & Kathy Najimy, who rise from the grave after a three hundred year slumber to suck out the life essence of all the children from Salem, MA, so they can remain eternally young. The same thing they tried three hundred years before, but were caught & hanged for. Max, played by Omri Katz, lights the ""Black Flame Candle"" as a joke gone bad, & resurrects the three witches in the process, who have their sight set on his little sister, Dani.There is a heavy Moe, Curly, & Larry (the Three Stooges) influenced performance from our three witches, as the fumble & bumble their way through the film. Funny performances are given by all three actresses, but Sarah Jessica Parker's performance as the sexy, boy crazy, dumb blonde gets my vote for performance of the show between the three. To bad the rest of the characters of the film are not up to that level, with the exception of Dani, played by Thora Birch, the young sister of Max, who just about steals every scene she is in. One of the cutest little girls outside of Phoebe, in ""the Monster Squad"" to appear in a children's horror/comedy the last 25 years.""Hocus Pocus"" is filled with great decorated sets & cinematography. It does actually catch the fondly remembered childhood innocence of Halloween, & not for only children, but us older children will enjoy watching the film too, remembering the days of ""Trick or Treat."""	4.0	The Three Stooges...Errr...I Mean Witches	2011-11-07	1	1	0

I was quite disapointed to find that there are NO SPECIAL FEATURES, but with the DVD presented in Widescreen and 5:1 Dolby Surround sound, It almost makes up for it. (I can't believe they couldn't even include the Movie Trailer!) Common Disney, re-release this DVD again and include the Numorous Deleted scenes, like The Supermarket Sequence, The Swimming Pool Sequence, ect ect., and how about including the Documentary of the Making of the special effects of Hocus Pocus that was shown on the Dicovery Channel back in 1994?

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	AEPJYN0NAX9N4	Jody L. Schoth	Surprisingly this movie did terrible in the theatres, but it really does make an excellent television movie.  The three witches were hilarious and very excitingly troublesome, as they seek revenge 300 years after their hanging after being resurrected.  This is a wonderful halloween movie... may scare some of the very young kids... not my mischevious little girls, but parents may want to watch it first to see if it's not too much for their little ones.  There are a few parts that I think are questionable.  However, this may be the reason this movie bombed out, as 90% of it is more interesting for the very young kids... then the other 10% is a little too much (or too scary) for them.  I would recommend parents to watch first, may be better for about 8 yrs and up... but may seem to childish to them.	5.0	Funny and action-packed!!!	2002-07-11	0	0	0

I give it four stars only because it was toned down in the scare factor department.  But, then, it's supposed to be fun for kids and adults, so, it's a Thackery Binx whisker away from a five. The movie is imaginative, very good lines and can be seen all throughout the year and not grow tiresome.  Bette Middler does a great job as Winnie, the eldest sister.  A black cat, magic spells and witches riding broomsticks a mop and a vacuum cleaner add to the fun of this yarn set in Salem.

Who in God's name says this movie is horrible??? It's halarious!  Bette Midler is supurb as Winnie! And everyone else in this film is great as well!

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A13IC3M3VJMF7J	J. Shores	I'm going to order this on Amazon, because I'm sending my Netflix copy back to them since 30 minutes into the movie it's impossible to watch.  It stops, puts out digital squares and finally covers itself in green digital colors.  My only worry is that like reviewer Gerald Hopkins said his doesn't play that mine won't play either.Netflix once told me the studios increase their security on the DVDs and they think thats what causes so many movies to become unwatchable.  Cleaning them makes no difference.  I've found almost all the new Disney movies I rent don't work.I saw Hocus Pocus at the movies when it first was released and have also seen it on tv.  I think its a very cute movie and I love Bette Midler in it.	4.0	afraid the movie won't play	2009-11-22	1	0	1

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A3L3G8P9MK26SI	JustMKollum	One word, CLASSIC! Watching this movie is a tradition for our family on Halloween! Our family cannot go one Halloween without watching this movie!It's the perfect movie if you're looking for a family-rated Halloween-themed movie, with comedy and with a just a little bit of spookiness to it.The storyline is great, it makes complete sense to why Witches are witches, to live off of children!I guarantee, if Bette Midler wasn't in this film, it could have been a flop. Bette Midler makes this movie! She plays the perfect Witch! I like how Bette, or known as Winifred takes things seriously and Sarah Jessica Parker (Sarah) and Kathy Najimy (Mary) are the goofy witches who are the opposite of Winifred. These witches are the perfect interpretation of what Witches would be like in real life!I haven't seen this air much on TV the last few years, which is a shame, so it's A MUST to own it on DVD!If you're looking for the perfect Halloween movie for the family, this is it!!!	5.0	A Halloween Classic!	2013-10-18	0	0	0

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A3VQ2HDAN5IYGQ	"Kali Justice ""Kali"""	"This is the funniest Halloween Movie I have ever seen.  Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy are excellently cast and hilariously funny.  I also love Bette Middler's singing of ""I Put a Spell On You"" at the Halloween Party.  I plan to watch this movie every Halloween.  This movie and Monty Python's Holy Grail are about the only two movies I have ever seen who continue to deliver laughs and lighten my spirit no matter how many times I've watched them.  Penny Marshall and Garry Marshall also have hilarious bits.  I don't know why this movie did not do well in the theater as it has a very funny script, wonderful performers and reminds me of the fun of Halloween when I was a kid.  (P.S. I am a Pagan and I know witches are not at all like this stereotype--but their stereotypical depiction are nevertheless very funny.  Real witches, like real fairies are nothing like what Hollywood depicts them--but the ""fakes"" are still very funny.)"	5.0	I never get tired of watching this movie again and again!	2010-06-25	0	0	0

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A7A6OPKV8DDGT	Kathleen Sharkey	I have never been able to understand why this movie did so badly at the  box office.  Not only does it have a rather original plot, but the ambience  is terrific!  Great photography and Halloween atmosphere.  But it has two  other things going for it that I especially found refreshing.  The young  boy who brings the witches back can only do so because it takes a virgin to  light the black flame candle.  It was so lovely to see a movie celebrating  male virginity without snickering.  The other plus is the fact that despite  his considering his little sister a nuisance in the beginning, he later  risks his life to save her.  The sibling tie was very strong and I found  this a positive role model for all kids to see.  The three witches are  wonderful. Yes, it's a little gory for young kids, but it's fantasy after  all.  As an adult, I loved it and watch it every Halloween.	5.0	The critics were definitely wrong!	2000-09-16	0	0	0

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	AV90JD8C9IUD0	Kevin Mesch	This review is slightly biast, mainly because this movie will go down as a classic. Created in 1993 and came out the same year. Featuring a nobody actor at the time, today is better known as McGee in NCIS (Binx!)I lover this movie, rented it for Halloween, and it was a great pick. It's scarey, and funny at the sametime. It's not scarey anymore, but when I watched this when I was 5-8 it was scarey. That's for the review part. Below will be a little critique, brief.I would've made Sarah J Parker witch Gwen Stefani, she had blonde feathered hair, and unlike SJP (as far as I know at least) can sing.	5.0	Slightly Biast, but Honest.	2012-11-08	0	0	0

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"Although I wouldn't put ""Hocus Pocus"" in the same category as a lot of Disney's other live-action fare, it is a very good family flick to watch on Halloween.  Most older children(six and up)can handle the ""horror"" sequences in this film.  The acting isn't too shabby and the music is fun for the little ones.Bette Midler turns in a modest performance as Winifred Sanderson.  Kathy Najimy is okay and Sarah Jessica Parker cranks out a fun, over-the-top performance as Midler's lesser witch sisters.  The story starts out three hundred years prior to the actual story where we witness the crime and punishment of the Sanderson sisters, who happen to be witches.  Three hundred years later, a new kid in Salem, MA by way of Los Angeles, lights up the black flame candle and raises the three sisters back from the dead.  Naturally, they wake up angry and intent on avenging their own fates by stealing the souls of youngsters in order to live forever.  Standing in their way are the teen from LA, his little sis, and a local teen with eyes for the candle lighter.  There's also a boy named Binx who's cursed to live forever in the form of a black cat.  He helps the kids out as they try to stop the witches before sunrise.  When the sun does rise, the witches will turn to dust without enough children's souls.The special effects are okay, but they aren't the focus of the film.  The action is pretty tame.  One character does lose his head, but in a humorous way.  His cranial loss does not lead to his death, but some kids might be turned off by a headless corpse flailing around.  In a few other scenes, witches attempt to suck the soul out of children, though the successful attempt is early in the film.  Other than that, everything else is pretty kid-friendly.Throw in a few silly one-liners, three hundred year old reactions to fire trucks, Satan and his lovely wife(hilariously pulled off by Penny Marshall), and one funny zombie named Billy, and you have a pretty good family film for the scariest of nights.The show moves at a quick pace, keeps the kiddies attention, and has a few laughs for adults as well.  I recommended it to anyone who has kids between six and twelve.  Older kids probably won't like this, so don't bother if you have teens."	3.0	Not At All Terrible	2005-10-29	23	13	10

A long time ago in Salem, Massachusets, 3 witches would suck lives out of little children to make themselves younger. But when Thackery Binks stumbles on to their secret while they steal his sisters soul, they turn him into a cat that will live forever. When the townspeople find out, they get really mad and hang the witches, but if a virgin lights the black flamed candle on Hallween night, the 3 witches will come back. Now it's 1993. A boy lights the candle to impress a girl and the witches come back to reek havic. They must suck lives out of alot of children before the full moon, or they will vanish forever.

The contemporary part is nearly embarrassing. BUT, when the Sanderson Sisters are reawakened, this film turns into a guilty pleasure. Bette Midler, especially, but Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker as well, play the sisters to the hilt, and it's fun to ride along and see how they cope with modern life.

Unfortunately, growing old and haggard, they needed to rejuvenate themselves by inhaling the life force of a child. So, they lured a neighboring child, into their cottage. Her brother tried to save her from her fate, but was unable to do so before he was discovered and turned into a black cat for all eternity.The three witches breathed in Emily's life force, with dire consequences for Emily, but the witches themselves turned more youthful thanks to Emily's life force. The townsfolk convene upon the cottage and capture the witches, whom they arrange to hang, but not before the witches cast a spell that is to have future ramifications.Cut to present day America. It is Halloween. Two teens and one of the teen's little sister break into the witches' cottage, which is still standing as a sort of historical museum. One of the teens does something which brings the witches back, and all hell breaks loose. Just sit back and let the laughs begin. What happens is quite funny, as the witches are hilarious.

A sceptic 'new kid on the block', Max Dennison (Omri Katz), flanked by a classmate Allison (Vinessa Shaw) and his younger sibling Dani Dennison (Thora Birch), in an audacious act, lights the candle and revives the Sanderson Sisters.Guided by an enchanted black cat Thakary Binx, the struggle is on as they embark on a journey to prevent the witches from gaining immortality until sunrise.A marvellous masterpiece by Kenny Ortega, 'Hocus Pocus' is jocular, fast-paced and frivolous, with plenty of sorcery and witchcraft to entertain a multitude of viewers, any audience, at any time. With superb antics and endearing, humorous themes, 'Hocus Pocus' is guaranteed to enchant its audience into a fantastical world, with the added bonus of 'dead man's toes' and 'rat tails', to ultimately cast its spell and make even the most sceptic viewer believe in the hocus pocus of Halloween night.	5.0	Wickedly witchy and crafty	2002-04-23	2	2	0

In order to survive past dawn, they must suck the lives out of the children (not like a vampire though) using a potion from their much prized book of spells.  But the past 300 years have brought on many changes for them that they have to overcome in order to get the book back from 3 kids to make the potion that makes the children susceptible to having the life sucked out of them.

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	AX9C10JD538D9	Liviania	The first time I saw Hocus Pocus,  I was just a little kid (maybe five or six) and my sister and I saw it somewhere.  We watched a VHS copy, because I grew up in the Dark Ages, and loved the movie.  There was music, adventure, a talking cat, and all sorts of craziness.  But then, I didn't know the movie's name.  I didn't know anyone else who'd seen it.  I thought my sister and I had dreamed it up and it didn't actually exist.  Then we saw it at my cousin's house.  It existed.I absolutely, unequivocally love this movie.  I'm glad that it's found a cult audience despite bombing in theaters.  And yes, it has stood the test of time.  I recently showed it to my niece and nephew and they enjoyed it.  My niece, who is almost five, rarely sits still for an entire episode of Spongebob Squarepants, which is only twenty-five minutes long and her favorite television show.  Hocus Pocus held her spellbound for an hour and a half.  (Okay, her attention did waver a little until the witches showed up.)  After she made sure to tell me how much she liked it.Hocus Pocus isn't your standard Disney film.  For one thing, most Disney films don't make multiple jokes about a teenage boy's virginity.  (Parents, don't worry.  They went over my head and my sister's when we were kids, and recently they went over my niece's head.)  There's even a scene, watching as an adult, that I realized was a G-rated version of masturbation.  And the Sanderson sisters are much scarier than most Disney villains.  Hocus Pocus opens with the death of a young child and another tortured before being cursed.  But that's part of what makes Hocus Pocus so much fun.  It trusts it's audience.  It's more funny than scary, but there's a real sense of darkness that sells the scary parts.Plus, the cast is fantastic.  Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy are pitch perfect as the Sanderson sisters.  Bette is menacing, vain, and gets to exhibit her amazing pipes.  Sarah Jessica Parker is sexy, daffy, and absently vicious.  Kathy Najimy's face is a wonder to behold.  Omri Katz was familiar to me from Eerie, Indiana, one of my favorite childhood TV shows.  He anchors the child actors, which included the cute-but-not-too-cute Thora Birch.  And I still can't believe Thackery Binx (Sean Murray) is the guy from NCIS.If you haven't seen this Halloween classic yet, watch it.  Buy it for your kids.  (Or your sibling's kids, whatever.)  Watch it on Halloween.  You can use it to start off a scary movie night, or as a break between two intense films.  For the kids, pair it with films like The Nightmare Before Christmas or Coraline.  I know lots of people watch it with Halloweentown.  You really can't go wrong as long as you watch it.	5.0	A Halloween classic	2012-10-29	0	0	0

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A2POFUU2U3X96U	Lj Magic	This is not one of Bette's more famous movies, and though it has a slow start, it turns out to be quite a fun show. Imagine 3 sisters from the era of the Salem witch trials in today's world.. They wouldn't stand out too much. But Bette seems to carry this show with her own style of comedy. One of the funniest moments has to be when the 3 have to find brooms to ride; and of course the nuttiest sister has to ad-lib when she can't find one. Though it starts slow, and at times the plot seems to get a bit too complicated, it still has moments of hilarity that only come from a Bette Midler style comedy. Fun for all ages, though some explanations might be needed as the plot lays out.	3.0	A Broom, A Mop, and A Vaccuum?	2007-12-07	4	0	4

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	AEM3CJ00FY94S	Mark	"There are plenty of positive reviews of ""Hocus Pocus"" out there, so I'll get straight to the point.  This movie is perfect Halloween entertainment for children because it has all the icons with no real terrors.After the brief 17th Century backstory, we see the protagonists in school in Salem on the day of Halloween hearing witch stories from the teacher.  The bicycle ride through the leaf strewn autumn woods that afternoon reminds one of many such days.  The scenes of the boy and his girlfriend taking his little sister Trick or Treating that night with flaming jack o'lanterns and other decorations in abundance is beautifully arresting.As for the 3 witches, notwithstanding their wicked intentions, Sarah Jessica makes for wonderful eye candy, Bette does a terrific rendition of ""I Put a Spell on You"", and Kathy is hilarious when she meets a hen-pecked husband dressed in a devil costume and believes that it is her master Satan offering her a Clark Bar.  Even the zombie is right out of your standard amusement park haunted house ride.  And the puns are a riot: Zombie to Bette, ""Go to hell."" Bette replies, ""Been there, done that.""  Add the talking cat to the mix, and it's all wonderful fun, with a magnificent coda where the sun rises the next day and sends our witches to their final destination and the exhausted parents home after a night of non-stop bewitched dancing.I don't know whether there will be any extras on the Blue Disc version when it comes out, but I can only imagine how the Blue Disc treatment will serve to enhance the gorgeous photography.  That by itself would be worth the purchase.There are a few other kid friendly films I would recommend: Ernest Scared Stupid (on blue disc since last year), Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (due out on blue disc 09/04/12), It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown (also BD), The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad (DVD only), and The Devil and Daniel Webster (Criterion DVD only), but Hocus Pocus takes the Number One spot."	5.0	Perfect Halloween Movie For Kids	2012-06-11	3	0	3

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A2VM257LPAD36Z	Marvolon	I'm a 21-year-old college student who will ALWAYS love this movie. When I was really young, maybe 4 or 5 (around 1995) , I remember this being on TV and watching it, loving it, and being scared by it all at the same time. For young viewers, it can be intense, but not overly traumatic. Every year it comes on on Halloween, and its' a must-watch. I finally bought it on DVD a couple years ago and I do not regret it one bit. It has been viewed many times, and it's so good that I often watch it during other parts of the year. Rainy cold, dreary nights make for a good setting to watch the movie. The story is phenomenal, a bit of Salem Witch Trial history, classic legend, classic young kid who wants to impress his crush. Without giving everything away, it's an adventure from start to finish. It's one of those types of movies where you imagine how fun/scary it would be if it would be possible to occur in real life. There's a lot off comedy, and the acting is actually pretty good! The actors/actresses portray their roles well, and flow together nicely. This is a classic that needs to be in every Halloween fan's DVD collection. It would be cool if it were to be released on Blu-Ray, however I'm not sure where the company stands on it. I loved being a 90's kid and this movies ALWAYS brings me back. GET IT NOW!EDIT: Hocus Pocus will be on Blu-Ray on September 4th, 2012.	5.0	Hocus Pocus- Always a Halloween Favorite	2012-08-24	1	1	0

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A375Y93A9XL9JU	Matthew	I absolutely LOVE this cute Disney movie, as the Divine Miss M. as the wickedly funny Winnie Sanderson, the witch sister of two other witch sisters, Mary and Sarah (Kathy Najimy and &quot;Sex In The City&quot;'s Sarah Jessica Parker) are resurrected by naive teen (Omri Katz) and his cute little sister (Thora Birch) trying to impress a pretty girl (Vinessa Shaw) who lights a black flame. A little bit of belly laughs, but mostly chuckles. But what makes up for the humor is the hilarious hijinks that ensue when the sisters are resurrected-looking for young children to suck their youth from, so they can live forever. This cute Disney movie has sufficient humor. It also has a little romance, a teeny bit of horror, and genuine warmth are cleverly interwoven in this 93-minute movie. A obvious Halloween favorite. (Don't miss that musical interlude, where the Divine Ms. M sings the funny &quot;I Put A Spell On You.&quot; It obviously does put a little spell on you.) You can also see it on HBO and Cinemax. Rated PG for mild language and some scary stuff.	5.0	Chuckles galore.	2001-05-12	12	10	2

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A18STJN3901AV7	maxGamer	This movie was a great little halloween movie to sit down and watch with the kids, but contrary to alot of the reviews here it's NOT for smaller children. There is swearing in the movie (d word, h word, and several unnecessary references to virginity and 'Yabos' referring to breasts) and there are several creepy spots with a zombie that smaller kids won't care for at all.Personally I think if your child is 14 and up they'll get a kick out of it.

It was supposed to arrive today for the holiday; but not only did it not arrive; when I went to the ""track your package"" link here on Amazon; it showed a departure from the site in West Virginia, but the next thing it showed was an arrival date in Kansas City, KS; completely bypassing Illinois! It would have had to go through the region in Illinois in which we live to get from one site to the other! This is completely ridiculous.

And I wouldn't be so indignant if it had a 3 star rating... but 4.7 average!? What's wrong with you people? I have to endure this turd daily right now, as my 3 year old gives it a 5 star rating and has it on repeat. I think the average reviewer's age is 40+ years older than she is, so I think this movie's rating is actually an indirect commentary on the degradation of our society. What the average reviewer is saying here is that this movie is up there with Saving Private Ryan, The Godfather, Casa Blanca, etc., etc. etc. Using the same yard stick for art appreciation, Yoko Ono is in the pantheon of great artists like Da Vinci and Michelangelo.If you read this review and you still intend to submit your own 5 star review for this movie, go take a good, long look in the mirror first.

Bette Midler fascinated me with the redhaired and the comedic, weird performance. In fact this also hooked kind of to the other performers-Sarah Jessica Parker, Kathy Najimy and Thora Birch. Many people dub this movie as a bomb when it really isn't as it made $40 million at the box office when it came out and a respectable return from rentals. The actors do a great job as the children awaken withces three hundred years later who were hung and killed by the village people. The witches must suck the lives from one of the children before the sun rises so that they can live forever. THe withces steal the show with a song that they sing and this walk in which they say HUNHH, HUNHH as well as how well they play off one another as almost THREE STOOGES female counterparts.

We watch it all the time.  It never gets tiresome or old...a classic you are sure to enjoy.  My only dilemma with it is that the portrayal of witches is so negative, I have found myself having to explain to my children that not all witches are ""bad,"" and this is Hollywood's invention...not really close to the reality of witches at all.

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A2UQIIJ2CD8REE	Monty Moonlight	"In the 1600s, the Sanderson sisters bewitched people. The three aging women, lusty Sarah, portly Mary, and sinister leader Winifred, were particularly fond of performing a certain spell that would keep them alive and young forever, with repeat use of course. Unfortunately, that particular spell required a living child as the key ingredient! One fateful Halloween night, that unpleasant honor went to adorable little Emily Binx, sister of teenaged Thackery, who immediately ran to his sibling's aid when he heard she'd been lured by Sarah Sanderson to the witches' home in the woods. This was not a well thought out plan though, and the cost was not only the life of his sister Emily, but his own humanity as well. Emily's lifeforce was drained from her body by the three Sanderson witches, and big-brother Thackery Binx was transformed into an immortal black cat, cursed to live forever with the guilt of his failure to save his sister! Luckily for the rest of the children of Salem, the Sanderson sisters were captured that night and hung for their crimes, but not before their living book of spells revealed to them a curse to bring the three back from the dead on All Hallow's Eve when a virgin lights the black flame candle.300 years later, teenager Max Dennison is a newcomer to Salem, struggling to adjust after growing up in a California lifestyle. It isn't going well for Max. Bullies are stealing his sneakers right off his feet, the girl of his dreams snubs him due to his lack of interest in Halloween, and his little sister, Dani, is ever the pest. Now, he must spend the evening escorting her door to door for trick or treating while their parents enjoy the town Halloween dance. Things are about to go from bad to worse for Max, however. Just when he believes things are looking up after he and Dani convince dream-girl Allison  to take them to the old Sanderson house, Max's efforts to impress the girl lead him to light the black-flame candle himself, bringing Sarah, Mary, and Winifred Sanderson back from the dead! From there on out, it's a non-stop, fun-filled chase as the witches pursue the children, determined to make sassy-mouthed Dani the subject of their next youth spell, which must be performed before dawn or else the witches will be gone forever! With the immortal, talking black cat Binx guiding them along, Max, Dani, and Allison work together to outrun, outwit, and outlast the evil trio and their magical arsenal, with the fate of all the children of Salem hanging in the balance!In ""Hocus Pocus,"" director Kenny Ortega, who also gave us the equally underrated and enjoyable cult-classic ""Newsies,"" brings us a perfect Halloween movie that's actually great fun any time of year! With a fantastic cast headed up by the legendary Bette Midler and ""Eerie Indiana's"" Omri Katz, awesome music (Hey, Disney, where's the soundtrack?!), a hilarious script that incorporates all the Halloween essentials, and brilliant special effects, ""Hocus Pocus"" easily ranks as one of my favorite films of all-time! Moments such as the bus ride, the encounter with the motorcycle cop, the visit to the Master's house, and, of course, the Sanderson sisters performing ""I Put a Spell On You"" at the town party just make this movie fun, fun, fun! The witches may be creepy at times and totally dangerous, but they have a Three Stooges vibe going throughout that keeps things from getting too scary. However, this film CAN be a bit much for younger kids. Yes, despite feeling generally like a typical Disney live-action flick from the `90s (a great time for Disney live-action), there are some surprising moments. The witches do off little Emily in the beginning of the film by stealing her ""essence,"" they do use some mild swearing and the virgin joke is unnecessarily hammered into the ground, and, yeah, some folks might find certain aspects scary, but only the very young I'd wager. Basically, this film was targeted at `tweens and teens, and, had they gone to see it, it would probably have been a hit. Unfortunately, it wasn't till repeat airings on the Disney Channel that most people discovered this gem of a holiday film. As for me, I saw it in theaters and am so glad I did! I wish we'd get more Halloween films like this one! This is how I like to see witches on Halloween! Cackling, riding brooms across the sky, and hunting trick or treaters! That's the concept of Halloween witches that scared me as a kid, and that's what I'd like to see more of in Halloween films today! The DVD is sadly bare-bones. Totally disappointing for such a spectacular cult classic! Still, it is without a doubt a must own for annual viewings at the very least!For more must watch Halloween viewing, check out ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown,"" ""Sleepy Hollow,"" ""Ichabod and Mr. Toad,"" the original ""The Worst Witch,"" ""Garfield Holiday Celebrations,"" the Casper, Addams Family, and Harry Potter films, ""Return to Oz,"" ""Raggedy Ann and Andy and the Pumpkin Who Couldn't Smile,"" ""The Night Dracula Saved the World,"" ""The Monster Squad,"" ""Ernest Scared Stupid,"" ""The Witches,"" ""Mad Monster Party,"" ""Spaced Invaders,""  ""Love At First Bite,"" ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein,"" and see my Halloween listmania lists for more! Also, for more great `90s Disney live-action films, check out the Mighty Ducks film series, ""The Adventures of Huck Finn,"" ""Dick Tracy,"" ""Cool Runnings,"" ""Newsies,"" ""Tom and Huck,"" the ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" films, ""101 Dalmatians,"" ""Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book,"" ""The Santa Clause,"" ""Tom and Huck,"" ""White Fang,"" ""Heavyweights,"" ""The Rocketeer,"" ""Three Musketeers,"" ""Iron Will,"" and more! But don't forget about classic Disney live-action either, or their great `80's stuff, like my number one favorite film, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit!"" With great new stuff like ""Herbie: Fully Loaded,"" ""Holes,""  ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" and the upcoming ""Chronicles of Narnia,"" it seems that Disney live-action is still going strong!"	5.0	The ULTIMATE Halloween Treat!	2005-11-15	144	127	17

These witches have their ""hang ups"" from the start in this hillarious Halloween comedy about three sisters who are attempting to fulfill the curse they cast on the townsfolk of Salem, Massachusetts three hundred years ago. Now finding themselves in the twentieth century, they set out to wreak havoc once again with their spooky spells and pick up where they left off. However, they've hit a slight snag. They have come back to find their home is now a tourist attraction, Winnie's book of spells has been stolen and they are no longer feared but are nothing more than a colorful urban legend. Determined to regain the Book of Spells and carry out their wicked deed before daybreak, they end up getting into the most hillarious of circumstances as they continually get outwitted by three resourceful kids who are determined to foil their wicked plans. But the clock is ticking...who will win? Salem or the Witches? Cameo performances by Penny Marshall and Frank Marshall add more spice to an already delightful film. Loaded with frightening holiday favorites like graveyards, ghouls, jack o'lanterns and moonlight broom rides. This whimsical film has also combined the stunning and beautiful Fall scenery of small town America celebrating this fun and festive holiday. It is sure to delight all veiwers. It also packs a great soundtrack with tunes performed by the divine Miss M herself and a haunting melody sung by Sara Jessica Parker. You can expect all the of chills and thrills of a great spooktacular film plus all the laughter of a hillarious comedy all rolled into one. It's also NIGHTMARE FREE for the kiddies!

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A1UJV4Y9IHNVXQ	MovieManTN	"One of my favorite family films ever. I could not wait to get this on blu ray after having it on VHS, Laser Disc, and DVD.This is, hands down, the BEST this movie has looked or sounded since I saw it in the theater (3 times) when it came out. The colors are vibrant, and give the perfect fall/Halloween look and feel. The sound is superb, along with the clarity of the film.That being said, WHY does Disney insist on giving NO BONUS FEATURES on some of its most beloved live-action theatrical films when they come to blu ray, but they will load up the crud like the direct to video ""Tinkerbell"" stuff, or the never-ending ""Air Buddy"" sequels??? I know for a fact that there are trailers and ""making-of"" documentaries out there for ""Hocus Pocus"" because I used to have them on a VHS tape. I worked in a video store when the movie first came to VHS, and we got in a screener copy from Buena Vista which had a behind the scenes featurette (about 15 min long, if I remember correctly) and it had the trailer. Why can Disney not put these things on the blu ray?Anyway, 4 stars overall because the film is a favorite, and it DOES look and sound terrific.

It has a good plot about three witch sisters from the Salem witch era are resurrected 300 years later by a virgin who lit a candle. Max, his sister, his new girlfriend, and a talking cat spend all HALLOWEEN night trying to figure out how to kill the witches. Once the flame from the candle is out, the witches will die. During this time, Sarah Jessica Parker was hot. I kind of had a crush on her, but not anymore. I always wished that they would make Hocus Pocus 2.

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A1LDIMQISH07WK	Rebecca	I looooove HOCUS POCUS! This is the best flick you could possibly find for a Halloween night. It's humorous and lighthearted, and can be pretty scary for kids under the age of 8. I'm 17 years old, and I still think HOCUS POCUS is the best Halloween flick. This movie is basically about the three Sanderson witch sistes who lived long ago in the 1600s during the Salem Witch Trials, in Massachusetts. Winifred, Sarah, and Mary want to make themselves look younger and more beautiful. So in the beginning, they create a spell that will suck the lives out of children who are more beautiful then they are and then they will receive all that beauty and youthfulness. Anyway, Thackery Binks is a young boy who lived during the time of the Sanderson witches. One morning when his kid sister, Emily Binks, runs off, he realizes that she's being hypnotized by the Sanderson sisters to go to their home in the middle of the woods so they can take her life. Thackery races off to rescue his sister, only to find that he is too late. The Sanderson sisters find Thackery in their house and attack him, turning him into a black cat forever, unless someone can break the spell. That night, the Sanderson sisters are found by the townspeople and are hanged for killing Thackery. The Sanderson sisters promise the townspeople that they will come back to life when someone lights the black candle in their home. Then 300 years go by and it is the present day. Max is a young teenage boy who moves with his family to Salem, Massachusetts from Los Angeles, California. On Halloween, his teacher tells his class the story on the Sanderson sisters, like she always does every year. Max, being new in town, doesn't believe the story of the three witches. Allison, a girl in his class whom he has a crush on, tells Max that the story is true, even though Max still doesn't really believe her. On Halloween night, when Max takes his little sister Dani out trick-or-treating, they end up going to this large house which happens to be the home of Allison. When he sees Allison, Max suggests to Allison and Dani that they all go to the Sanderson witches home - which has been turned into a museum - to see if the story his teacher told them really was true. Dani believes the story and doesn't want to go. But Allison agrees to it and then Dani, who has to go since their parents are at a Halloween party, agrees to go. They get to the home of the Sanderson sisters and find Thackery, who is still a black cat. Thackery tells them about the Sanderson sisters and Max, who still wants to prove that he is right that the witches don't exist, lights the black candle, bringing the Sanderson sisters back to life. Now, Max, Allison, and Dani are on a wild and hilarious chase to catch and destroy the Sanderson sisters before it is too late (which would be at dawn the next morning) and before the Sanderson sisters can suck the lives out of all the children in town. Bette Midler and Sarah Jessica Parker are excellent in this film, so are Omri Katz (who plays Max), Kathy Namijy, Vinessa Shaw, and a very young Thora Birch. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves Halloween!	5.0	Best Halloween flick in ages!	2001-03-07	18	15	3

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A3AKPY4LXIC24O	Ryan Costantino	A word of warning:  Parents of children under 7 please heed the PG rating if you wish to avoid the inevitable nightmares this movie will cause!I first caught Hocus Pocus during a Disney Channel free preview, and was, to say the least, reluctant in watching it.  But about halfway through (and through the visual stimuli of Vinessa Shaw) I found myself actually enjoying the movie.  The next time it was on I watched again.  Thus, a Halloween tradition was born.  Watching for the eventual appearance of this movie on Disney proved somewhat tedious and so I made the purchase. Now it's a staple Halloween viewing at my house that the entire family enjoys.  It did used to scare the pants off my sister (there are some pretty heavy elements to this film, such as the death of a sibling and the witches desire to eat children) but now that she's older she enjoys it as much, if not more, than I do.  For the guys there are two lovely ladies in the cast that make this worth viewing, Sarah Jessica Parker and Vinessa Shaw.  For the kiddies (the target audience) there's trick or treating, witches, a talking cat, ghosts, and fun for all!  If you have kids or ever were one yourself, or if you just love Halloween, take Hocus Pocus for a spin.  It'll put a spell on you!!	5.0	A Great Halloween Film Tradition!!!!!!!	2000-10-05	0	0	0

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A3PX0UHRBGTM2R	Scotington	"Kind of a bummer, I eagerly awaited this release, excited to finally get it on high def Blu-Ray.It's a decent enough transfer and it offers an improvement over the DVD.It is not going to upset any fans of the film, but it is also not going to impress anyone.The prior DVD release was a sub-par 16x9 letter-boxed image formatted within a 4x3 frame for old television screens.What you get on a widescreen TV is an image where the movie has black bars on all four sides, you then have to blow up the image to properly take up the screen on a widescreen television, and the image suffers as a result.In typical Disney fashion, to obtain the Blu-Ray I was force-fed another copy of the DVD.Problem is, Disney took the cheap route and didn't re-master the DVD to benefit widescreen TV's - it's same old crappy DVD transfer from 2002Not every TV in my house has a Blu-Ray player connected to it, so the ""New"" DVD is pretty useless and offers nothing over my original.Buy this for the Blu-ray only, if you're hoping for an updated DVD you will not be satisfied."	3.0	Buy this for the Blu-ray - The DVD is still a useless mess.	2012-10-28	1	0	1

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A3EOHYIHQM3KK	Sean Ares Hirsch	This is one of my favorite Halloween movies. Do some of the contents pass plausibility? Yes. But, at least they have a legendary background. The interaction between the 3 witches is clever and comical. The images are well done, and the music is entertaining and chilling. One of the best things about this movie is that it offers you a tase of fear, but not so much that it goes from scarey to absurd. The action is well done, and character development is admirable. Fear, suspense, and comedy are mixed with a rare delicacy. Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that the witches' frightening and evil intentions march side by side with their comical confusion about the late 1900s. As scarey movies for Halloween go, this one takes the candy!	4.0	An Ideal Halloween Movie	2000-11-13	0	0	0
6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A1AEI48054PKVO	Sebastian1966	"This movie is strictly for Halloween lovers only.Gorgeously photographed by Hiro Narita (DP on ""The Rocketeer"" and ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country""), and directed with a deliberately light touch by Kenny Ortega, this is a solid Halloween entertainment for the whole family.  The images are nicely evocative of the holiday.  Any scares are more  of the bumbling, silly kind (youngsters may get a jolt here and there; nothing too traumatic).  The makeup FX are not particularly graphic either (even a zombie is seen as more as a Wizard of Oz-type scarecrow sort, rather than a flesh-eating mindless monster).  This movie is harmless fun, on the order of ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" (though not nearly as memorable).  On the negative side, the three witches' over-the-top shtick (particularly Bette Midler's wild overacting) are positively headache inducing, but younger kids will probably find it entertaining.I was initially going to buy this one on DVD, as it's really a once-a-year kind of movie; but when I found that the original DVD release was not enhanced for widescreen TVs, I searched Amazon and found that Disney was releasing it on bluray in it's proper aspect ratio.  And the blu ray looks good enough, but the movie is almost 20 years old, so don't expect ""Avatar"" or ""Avengers"" quality here; it's serviceable, not a gold standard.  Also comes with a DVD copy as well (perfect for playback in the car's DVD player for long trips).  A lack of bonus features was a bit disappointing, but I suppose this is the kind of movie one shouldn't really analyze to death anyway.  It's a lighthearted Halloween romp for the whole family, and if you watch it in that vein?  It works very well indeed..."	3.0	As silly as candy corn, but a cute Halloween movie all the same...	2012-11-02	0	0	0

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A2X9D80U93BG89	Serine E. Givens	I am personally not big on scary movies, so my options are limited at Halloween. When I found this movie I was sceptical at first, but then found myself sucked into the fun!The Sanford sisters are very funny, played by Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and another very funny lady. The costumes are great, and Thora Birch who plays the sister of the main character does a great job, and I am hard to impress with child actors.It's good for a holiday spooky and funny movie, there is a bit of mature language for small children though, depending on how protective you are of your children, and some dark ideas, but this is typical of Halloween. It's now a classic in my collection.	4.0	Fun, Halloween Classic	2005-10-24	3	2	1
6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	AE9JH12P0CETA	S.G.R. Black	"I got to thinking what movies about witches are the best. I could only think of a handful like ""The Witches of Eastwick"", ""The Craft"", ""The Witches"", and ""Hocus Pocus""; two very dark, adult films and two more family oriented films. How I came to those decisions was me thinking about how witches were portrayed; you know, the classic characteristics that you got about the as you grew up like: 1. Flight. Yes, all films show flight but it's only 'Hocus Pocus' that shows flight on broomticks; the classic way. 2. Spells/Magic. All four had them but which one had lightning and electricity coming out of thier fingertips? - 'Hocus Pocus'! 3. The wardrobe. 'Hocus Pocus' was the only one that seemed to be going for the most authentic look for a witch. Therefore, I think 'Hocus Pocus' is without a doubt the best film about witches since 1993.I know this sounds crazy. I'm the kind of person who wouldn't be caught dead telling someone that I abosolutely loved this movie. My kinds of films are far more adult (i.e. P.T. Anderson's Magnolia, The Hours, Pulp Fiction, Lost in Translation). So to go from that to this is a big step for me! OK. In all seriousness, I can't stress how much FUN this film is! I thouroughly enjoyed it so much and I'm over the age of 20! I know it's target audience is fairly young but I probably wouldn't want my little ones under the age of 10 to watch it. Yes, it's Disney but this movie has some pretty daring content for the regular family Disney fare we all know. There's a handful of curse words, though small ones but still enough to not want your small children repeating them. Heads are beheaded (with no blood), dead people come up from the grave, and a black cat gets run over flat. Mind you, this is all centered around three witches who are reserected by a virgin (if don't think your kids are ready to know what a virgin is, then you might want to skip this. The word is thrown around a couple of times, as a joke of course). Their mission: to suck the souls out of all the children in Salem! Pretty risky stuff, huh?- for Dinsey!I am so surprised that this was such a bomb in theaters. It truely is an underrated effort. The production value is top notch. The special effects are really good and hold up really well even in our ""matrix-esque"" era. The preformances are great. You have to think, these are 17th century witches we're discussing. They have to be somewhat enjoyable to watch. Luckily, they are. Bette is perfect as the head honcho. Kathy Naijimy and the wonderful Sarah Jessica Parker are equally fabulous. If you watch and love ""Sex and the City"", then you'll get a kick out of watching Miss Bradshaw bumble around. Overall, I was totally bewitched!"	5.0	Maybe It's Just Me	2005-06-21	0	0	0

I was feeling rather depressed at the fact, since it's my MOST FAVORITE season.  Last year, the school he attends played it for the students and I got to watch it and was thoroughly satisfied.  The movie people disbanded, so I did not expect to get to watch it this year.  AND we don't have cable here, so there was no watching it on Fox family.  I was extremely surprised on the day before Halloween when this movie arrived in the mail!  I have been watching it since it first came out, way back in 1993 or whatever and find that it is one of my favorite parts of Halloween.

I watch it every year to kick off autumn..then watch it over and over through Halloween. It just makes me happy. It's too bad Disney originally released this film in the summer.

They are brought back to modern day on Halloween night after a virgin teen lights a candle that had a spell on it and hilarity ensues. This movie is fantastic! My whole family loved it and it is suitable for children of all ages. It's our favorite movie for Halloween. They don't call Bette Midler the Divine M for nothing!

Loved the soundtrack  (particularly Midler's &quot;I Put A Spell On You&quot;) which of course is  my primary beef....What happened to it? Wanted to add it to my collection  but apparentally it was never released (although the end credits say there  was one).  Does anyone know out there?	4.0	Great Halloween Comedy	1999-12-13	0	0	0

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	AL2CQ6MY5KDT3	Suhaimi	This is a movie about the Sanderson sisters who, after three hundred years finally comes back to life with a mission: to steal the lives of young children before the black flame candle is out or perish forever. Bette  Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy fit in their roles as the  three lovable withches. Sarah is perfect as the fun-loving sister who does  not take life seriously and her character is totally different from that of  Bette's; a no-nonsense typical fairy tale witch who preys on the fears of  children and adults alike. Kathy is brilliant as the peacemaker and sound  of reason to the Sanderson family. This movie not only talks about  witchcraft but it also highlights common themes, like sibling rivalry, the  angst of teenagehood and of course the popular theme that good wiill always  triumph over evil. Each theme is cleverly interwoven to create a harmonious  flow of an explicit plot with comic effects.  Indeed, the presence of Binx,  the talking cat, does add a touch of classy humour, even if it's a bit  dark(the humour not the cat). The spells add a dark intensity to the mood  and atmosphere of the entire movie (as seen in the scene where Winifred  spat out a curse that will release them to earth). The Gothic element in  the story makes it worthwhile to watch and believe me, the ending is  exhilarating. The rating of this movie is best summed up through Sarah's  spell of attracting the children: Come little children, I'll take thee  away, Into a land of enchantment. Come little children, The time's come to  play, Into my garden of magic. Truly, this is a movie worth watching. After  all, isn't it the wishes of most parents to see their children  disappear(until the holiday's over)? This movie will surely allow you to  live out this fantasy.	5.0	excellent work	2000-03-15	0	0	0

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A2YC2A5FIKR79I	Susan H.	I never understood the negative reviews for Hocus Pocus.  We went to the  theatre anyway and thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Bette Midler is hammy,  yes, but it's Bette!  She's playing a beaver-toothed, child chasing 17th  century witch in a Disney flick.  What else is there but hammy?! Kathy  Nijimy, with her Dairy Queen hair and lopsided grin, is a hoot.  And Sarah  Jessica Parker, the curvaceous, third sister, does Sex In the  City...Salem-style! (stictly PG of course!)  Thora Birch has yet to reach  her brooding, raven-haired American Beauty stage, so she's still adorable!  And to top it off, there is Zachary Binx, the talking black cat...an  obvious inspiration for Sabrina, the Teenage Witch's Salem!  My  seven-year-old daughter loves this movie!  I finally purchased the video  today (we had been holding out for a DVD release) to save myself the video  rental fees! If you're not a &quot;serious student of film&quot; and can  sit and watch and just enjoy a fun movie...rent Hocus Pocus for a test  drive...and then buy it!	5.0	Any witch way you slice it...Hocus Pocus is fun!	2000-09-18	15	15	0

It's about how 3 witch sisters are brought back to life and their quest to stay alive for an eternity using a spell, a potion, and a child.  It's also about the relationship between a brother and his younger sister; mix in a new girlfriend, and a wonderful black cat named Binks, who teaches them all how to fight the evil witches and their black magic. In the end, good wins over evil and even Binks is freed of the curse that the witches had placed on him 300 years earlier.

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A3TAK09CJAWQ9C	Tiffany Rose	I have loved this movie ever since I saw it as a little girl in the movie theater! The movie is about three witches, Mary, Sarah, and Winifred Sanderson, who suck the life out of children in order to look young. In the 1600s the witches are hanged, but not before Winifred could cast a spell which would bring them back when a virgin lights the Blackflame candle. Flash to 1993 and a virgin, Max, lights the candle to impress a girl he likes, Alison, and brings to witches back to life. The three witches chase Max, his little sister Dani, and Alison throughout the night after they steal Winifred's magic Book.This movie is filled with laughs and family fun!

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A2JP0URFHXP6DO	Tim Janson	This film got pretty well raked over the coals by the critics when it first came out and died a quick death.  There it sat much like the witches until the Disney channel brought it back to life as one of their regularly run movies during Halloween.  These repeated showings have served to make it a minor holiday classic.  It kind of plays more like a TV movie than a big budge movie, but that's ok.  Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy play the Sanderson sisters who were put to death as witches back in Salem 300 years earlier.Flash forward to the present and Max Dennison and his family have moved from LA to Salem, MA.  Max is played by Omri Katz, who starred in the short-lived but underrated Eerie, Indiana TV show.  Max is having trouble adjusting to small-town life and becomes the target of local bullies.  Max is forced into taking his little sister Dani out trick-or-treating and eventually goes to the home of Allison, a girl he has a crush on.  They all go to a local historical museum and Max accidently lights the black flame candle and brings the trip of hags back to life.They attack the three kids but the kids get help from Thackery Binx, a boy who had been turned into a black cat by the witches centuries ago.  The witches plan to use the life force of the children of Salem to give themselves immortality and it's up to the three kids and the black cat to save Salem.This is really an enjoyable Halloween film for families.  There are some scares but nothing too frightening.  Bette Midler is grotesque as the buck-toothed Winifred Sanderson, bossing her sisters around and playing somewhat of a wicked witch on too much caffeine.  Sarah Jessica Parker is a scream as Sarah Sanderson, the Ditzy, blonde-haired sister.  There's a great scene where they intrude on a residents home and the residents are played by Penny & Garry marshall.  Really a fun movie for Halloween.	5.0	Much Better Than Critics Give it Credit For	2005-10-18	4	4	0

The only thing is I believe it portrays what a Witch really is. However, I still like this movie, but some real Witches might not, unless they can except that there is really a darker side to Witches'. Witches' really are not into harming people like this movie would try to make one believe. I still give this movie a good rating. I have a friend who watched this movie and did not like it. However, it is like a kid movie, sort of like the Wizard of Oz is how I see this movie. I would put it in that category.	4.0	I rather like this movie	2001-01-23	0	0	0

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A12QK855JE8LKI	Travis	I watch a movie for 2 reasons; the trailer, and the actors. If it looks good there's a good chance I will go see it. If it has actors I love and it looks good there's an even greater chance. With this movie, I first rented it because of the three actress's on the cover. Bette Midler, on the cover, just looked like she would be funny. I was right, I have never seen Bette funnier in  this type of comedy, the voice, the facial expressions, the lines, GoodBye World? I also had loved Kathy Nijimy in Sister Act and she also was funny in this movie especially with the vaccum? Sarah J.P. was really funny as the dumb frightened, at times, witch. Seeing her jumping onto the black river, very funny? This movie doesn't have the best scipt all the way through but it does more than make up for it with these three great leading actress's. This will surely be a Halloween Cult Classic for years to come.	4.0	Bette, Kathy, and Sarah	2002-03-10	0	0	0

But there is mention of a ""virgin"" lighting the black flame candle, several times. So if that's too mature for younger viewers then parents might want to watch first.  However, in my opinion it also points out that being a virgin is nothing to be embarrassed about.  But you will not be disappointed. I think nowadays kids understand the concept.

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A3RAEPOSZTM76L	Veronica Anzaldua	I like this movie for several reasons.  For one thing, Bette Midler (as Winifred Sanderson, one of the witches) looks so ugly with her buck teeth, but she's also very funny.  I also think that the zombie, Billy (the one with his mouth sewn shut) is funny, the way he groans when he's hurt and loses his head (literally) twice.  What I also like is the theme of brother-sister love, such as the love that Thackery Binx, a 17th-century boy who's turned into a talking cat by the Sanderson sisters, feels for his deceased sister, Emily (who dies at the hands of the three witches).  I also like the funny lines-- like the scene where Billy tells Winifred to go to hell and she says, &quot;I've been there.  I find it quite lovely, thank you.&quot;  Normally, I don't watch Disney movies, but I like this one.  It'll put a spell on you!	4.0	This Is a Funny Movie	2001-04-20	0	0	0

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	AFEN54UGJQOK9	"wally gator ""the only"""	"In the Halloween family movie dept. I'll give this one five stars because it has something for everyone in the family. For me, it has Sara Jessica Parker. One of the best all time hot witches. Theres a scene that I enjoy specifically where she flies around the town on her broom singing a spell that she uses to lair children into her ""garden."" In an another equally enjoyable scene a dirty bus driver lets her drive the bus while sitting on his lap.Overall the movie has good characters all around. The teenage boy, who haphazardly ressurects the witches from a three hundred year death (Salem witch trials) due to the fact (hillariously mentioned several times) that he is a virgin. Don't worry, it's subtle enough to fly over little kids heads... His sister, who is played by a pretty young Thora Birch, who you may remember from movies like Ghost World and American Beauty is obsessed with this cat who gets them into all sorts of trouble with the witches. ... mom goes to a Halloween party dressed up like ""cones era"" Madonna, and then of course you have the witches... Bette Midler trys to seduce this old jewish guy, the other chick, and Sarah Jessica Parker,,, who, if you weren't paying attention, is a total fox. I dig the scene where the kid and his girlfriend check to see if his sisters in her bed, only to find Sara the witch laying in there instead...BOO! Happy Halloween!Overall this movie makes good comic use of the story line. For instance, the scene where the witches can smell children, but can't see any, even though they are swarming the streets (they are ""tricked"" by the Halloween costumes, clever!) and the movie moves quickly enough along so that no one gets bored...

6302968143	Hocus Pocus [VHS]	A1POFVVXUZR3IQ	Z Hayes	I remember watching this years ago with my siblings around Halloween time. We laughed at the cheese factor but still loved it nevertheless. Bette Midler is wicked in her role as Winifred, the leader of the Sanderson witches, and Kathy Najimy plays the dumb witch, Mary with Sarah-Jessica Parker playing Sarah, the wannabe temptress witch. All three were hanged back in the 1600s in the town of Salem, MA for practicing witchcraft, but had vowed to return and exact revenge.Fast forward three hundred years later, and there's a new boy in town, Max Denison (Omri katz). Max is cynical about Salem's history and doesn't believe in the Sanderson story. On Halloween night, Max reluctantly takes his little sister, Dani (a very young Thora Birch) trick or treating, and meets up with his dream girl, Allison (Vinessa Shaw). The trio go to the Sanderson house which is reputed to be haunted. When Max defiantly lights up a candle in the house, he releases the spirits of the three wicked witches and all hell breaks loose. The kids' only ally is an immortal black cat, and they have to race against time (before dawn) to ensure the witches do not get their revenge against the children of Salem, and can be destroyed forever.The effects may seem cheesy by today's standards (they were even back then) but it still makes for a fun Halloween watch. The acting is actually pretty good, and Bette Midler in particular shines as the wicked witch who absolutely delights in her role (and it shows). I watched it yesterday with my first grader and she loved it!	4.0	A wickedly delightful Halloween classic	2011-10-22	2	2	0
