A visual masterpiece if there ever was one.However, the movie itself is lame. Not my cup of tea. My fiance loved it though. Definetly a kids movie but if you're new to Blu-Ray and want to see the best picture available do yourself a favor and buy this.This movie is a technical showcase - the move itself has little substance if any to be had.	5.0	Awesome Pciture - kind of a weak movie though	2008-12-30	2	0	2

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1ALOIPRR8Q06J	"2 cents ""meaningless memes"""	"This film looks so great! Really an amazing, first-rate achievement  here.The robots had a bit much personality, really. I mean, on the one hand, whatever. ""It's a movie"" as they always say. But if we're going to think about the movie.. (Unlike the lady that sat behind me who I must confess I would be shocked to hear any observations from other than the roach was gross and WAll-E was cute and funny..) I mean I just casually wondered why a trash compactor would have so much emotion programmed into it. So longing and needy, and so, so alone, the poor thing. I started to really feel for Wall-E. Ahh, well THAT'S why. And because it's a movie, right? Maybe he is like that Short Circut? Perhaps somehow he evolved during the several hundred years he beaverd away at all that garbage. Anyway, it is a story and if your going to have a story about robots falling in love it would be weird if neither had any personality. Lol. Ya know, some people are like that...But if you want compelling romance you need personalities and chemistry.Pixar is fantastic. Man, at this point I'll say those guys are commited to doing art. You know when you watch a Pixar film that vision and imagination have been fully realized. Not compromised one bit! That's the key.Anyway, really dug the film. Consider it a new classic. A friend I saw it with said, ""That's the sweetest movie I've ever seen"" and meant it. He meant ""sweet"" as in touching and you now what? It is a sweet story."	5.0	robot love story	2008-08-19	8	7	1
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	"As original as Pixar's `Wall-E' is, two films came to my mind.  One is a quaint science fiction movie from the seventies, 'Silent Running' starring Bruce Dern, about a lone scientist who keeps the last forest safe on a vessel in outer space.  Significantly, that film had the first robots in memory with two definable personalities, even a few years before 'Star Wars'.  The other film is '2001 - A Space Odyssey,' a science fiction classic that upped the quality of science fiction on the big screen and provided the big budgets we now take for granted.  In that film there was a space station run by a computer with a mind of its own creating a real human disaster and mutiny within the wastes of space.  Unabashedly, they even use some of that soundtrack here.Entering 'Wall-E' I was impressed by the animation and the fluid action scenes.  There are still plenty of new tricks to celebrate in this film, but the real chemistry comes from its two main characters.  This time we follow the titled character (Ben Burtt), a dirty, worn robot who works like a trash compactor at the city dump.  He gathers metal refuse and crushes it on his insides only to spit out building blocks for more city structures.  We learn quickly about his personality when he goes home to a storage room like structure where he likes to unwind his circuits and watch an old videotape of `Hello, Dolly! Widescreen Edition'.  A cockroach is his only companion, one of the few signs of life among the bleak city skyline.  Partly endearing, partly a nuisance, some heart comes to the movie as we see him follow Wall-E around like a pet dog.Enter a space rocket.  It's a source of fear and fascination for Wall-E who's never seen such a thing.  Out of the alien craft comes a probe; one that mechanically searches the data of everything it meets and destroys anything threatening on its sensors.  As the tape gives him new meaning, he overcomes his fear and tries to meet this new robot, whom he learns to call ""Eva"" or ""Eve"".  Wall-E tries to impress her using anything from bubble wrap to egg beaters; his clumsiness showing his softer side. Love blossoms, but is not received until one day the rocket returns and picks Eve up.  Determined not to let a good thing go, Wall-E attaches his mechanical arms to the ship for dear life as he discovers a ""brave new world"" of comfy humans on a displaced technological ""cruise ship"" sent out for a five year journey.  Chaos ensues when Eve returns with a plant found in her inner workings after Wall-E gave it to her as a gift.  It doesn't fit the cruise control they're accustomed to.Without being heavy handed or cynical, `Wall-E' charms us with its contrast.  We get all the themes implied here, but we receive it in such a glowing way, it never leaves the residue of desolation the movie so warmly, yet desperately, persuades us to leave behind.  Although the movie is received differently by children and adults, there's plenty for everyone to appreciate in this wholehearted movie offering.(Anyone familiar with 1981's 'Heartbeeps,' starring Bernadette Peters and Andy Kaufman, knows that this movie idea has been done before.  Without the careful care of Pixar's craftmanship and imagination, 'Heartbeeps' demonstates that, in the wrong hands, these movie ideas can sometimes bring disastrous results.)(More traditional is ""Presto,"" which continues Disney's admirable throwback to fine pre-feature animated entertainment.)"	4.0	A Robotic Love Story with Themes That Do Compute	2008-06-30	17	12	5

So imagine my disappointment when the DVD arrives and won't play on a single computer or DVD player in the house.  Even worse, I was able to get the commercials/previews to play on one player, but then the actual movie still froze up.  (Stay classy, Disney.)I guess I should be glad that I've been through this with other DRM-crippled DVDs, and therefore knew to try it out while my son was not present, or there would have been major preschooler tears.But as if that weren't enough, the digital copy included on disc three requires an unlock code that was supposedly included on an insert in the DVD packaging.  I am sitting here looking at every piece of packaging that was in or on the DVD (even the plastic wrap) -- there is no such insert/code included.  Sorry, kid... no ree-bots on the iPad, either.So basically, what I've got here is a 3-Disc Special Edition Coaster Set, and zero ree-bots for my kid.  Thanks for nothing, Disney.[UPDATE:  As I sit here fuming over my serious lack of ree-bots, I just noticed the very, very fine print... ""Digital Copy Activation Code expires November 18, 2009.""  Maybe that's why there wasn't a code in my packaging, but wow, if you're going to do it that way, Disney, maybe don't sell this version after that date?

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1LBAC84TLIGAX	"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF"""	There's something endlessly likable about this film, and it never gets old to watch. In this day and age I rarely rave about a children's film because so many of them are awful. Growing up, I watched practically every animated Disney classic you can think of including Pixar films, but then a dreaded year called 2005 came around. This was one of the worst years in the history of cinema and it unleashed a tidal wave of awfulness which included two animated films; Chicken Little and Madagascar. I absolutely hate both of these films which almost completely destroyed my liking for animated films. Then 2006 came around and I was treated to Happy Feet, which would go down as the worst film I've ever seen and would earn the lowest score I've ever handed a product on this site (0 out of 10). Then 2007 dropped the utterly terrible Meet the Robinsons film smack dab in my lap. These films are the reasons why I watch almost nothing but films that would make a parent cringe if their kids watched them. But then, I came across this film, and out of curiosity I decided I wanted to see it. It felt like a splash of much-needed cold water to the face and proved to me I can still have hope for the future animated films. Foolish me, I shouldn't have doubted Pixar films.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: This film takes place somewhere in the year 2800. Earth is a barren wasteland of garbage where virtually no life is present, except for a little robot named Wall-E who more than 700 years ago along with a number of other robots was tasked with cleaning up all of the garbage on Earth by crushing it into cubes and and piling it up. Now he along with a small bug are the only living things on the planet and he goes through a daily routine of crushing garbage, piling it up, and collecting anything of interest to him. While he's going through garbage one day he finds a small plant inside of a refrigerator, puts it in a shoe and puts inside of him. Then a mysterious ship lands on the planet and lone robot called Eva is left there. Her goals as it turns out is to find any source of life that would prove that Earth would be finally habitable. Wall-E is afraid to approach Eva because she is armed with a powerful laser gun that can destroy large objects with no problem. But when a sandstorm comes around, he takes Eva back to his home where he shows her around and then shows her the plant he found. She acts strangely, takes the plant, and then appears to go into a sleep mode with a strange flashing green sign on her. Days later, the mysterious ship returns and takes Eva back, but Wall-E follows the ship and hangs on for dear life as he is taken into space to a strange ship. The people on board have been living there for 700 years and have gotten morbidly obese and rely on moving chairs and a computer screens to get them through daily life while the machines run most of everything else. From then on, Wall-E and Eva are taken on one crazy adventure that's very memorable and very enjoyable.MUSIC: The music in this film was highly enjoyable and very well done. It fit well with the tone of the film.ACTING: The voice-actors were pretty good and the dialogue and humor was funny as well. I have no gripes with this area, Pixar has always done a good job of finding talented actors.ACTION: This film could be crazy at times and was rarely boring to watch. The only boring part of the film was the beginning which started slow. However, the film quickly picks up steam afterwards and you will be treated to a highly entertaining film. My biggest complaint against the film however, is the fact it felt as if they didn't take the story as far as it could have gone.OVERALL: If you love Pixar films or just good films in general, Wall-E is a must-see. Both kids and adults will get a kick out of this film because it's endlessly likable in almost every way. It is flawed, but those are easy to overlook. This is easily one of the best animated films of the decade, no question.THE GOOD: Stunning CGI animation, great music, good storyline, good humor, good actors, and plenty of action to go around.THE BAD: Slow beginning and it felt as if Pixar didn't take the film as far as it could have gone.	4.0	ENDLESSY ENJOYABLE  8.75 OUT OF 10	2009-07-22	3	1	2

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2J2RJ7GM09BQY	A. G. Brown	As a movie Wall-E operates on several levels -- in the background, a commentary on humankind's misuse/neglect of its the world we live in and the role of the modern corporation in fostering that very neglect -- and in the foreground, front and center, the resilience of the human spirit and our ability, collectively and individually, to learn and to change for the better.  Above all, Wall-E is a beautiful love story, a classic tale of mismatched lovers.Wall-E himself is an introvert, a hopeless romantic, a learner, an inventor, and one who knows how to take care of himself.  That he is also a robot, a machine only makes his character all the more poignant and attractive.  He is the humble soul who plugs away at his job and yet aspires to do and be something more.In Eve, we find a modern, decisive, driven (her &#34;directive&#34; is initially all-consuming) powerful (she packs serious heat), elegant woman who can nonetheless fall for the charms of her goofy, unglamorous love interest.  Here is the classic mismatched couple celebrated time and again in literature and movies -- from Cyrano de Bergerac to Star Wars.The movie itself is a series of wonderful gifts beyond these two main characters and their love story -- the amazing animation, with sweeping vistas of neglected earthbound cities, dancing in the sky, rogue robots clattering through spaceship corridors, the heroic delivery of one small plant growing in an old boot -- as well as the many smaller vignettes in the lives of other characters who gradually discover who they are and who they can be.This version of the movie, in high definition, only takes the story and the characters and the animation to a higher and more rewarding level.	5.0	A classic movie beautifully packaged and presented	2013-02-27	1	1	0

I typically wait for a price reduction when a new Disney/Pixar DVD comes out, but I bought this immediately for one reason, the Pixar Story documentary by Leslie Iwerks.  Iwerks, granddaughter of Mickey Mouse designer Ub Iwerks, has produced yet another stellar, feature-length documentary--one that chronicles the history of Pixar up through the production of Cars.  This documentary is certainly worth the price of the upgrade and is highly recommended.  The other special features on disc two are fair, at best, and not up to the quality that Pixar once produced on their original, lavish 2-disc sets.  If it weren't for the 90-minute documentary (which ironically never mentions Wall-E), this would not be a worthwhile ""special edition.""The third disc is simply a digital copy of the film, no additional special features.  I loaded it onto my computer for fun, and I suppose if you do a lot of traveling or enjoy watching films on portable devices, it's nice to have.  Personally, it seems like a pointless waste of a disc, and I predict that this digital copy craze will be dead within a year or two.The packaging is strange.  It tries to be environmentally friendly, though ironically the bonus digital copy disc will be worthless trash after the activation expires in one year's time.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A319Y83RT0MRVR	AIROLF	The latest animated film from Pixar is cute and cuddly, but unfortunately the story is touching but not revolutionary. The most fascinating thing about Wall-E is that hardly anyone utters a word for the first hour or so of the movie. And yet, it's better that way - pictures speak louder than words, and Pixar's fantastic animation yells out to us in a way that no one else can. Yet, as a follow up to Ratatouille, I couldn't help but be disappointed by the limited scope of the story of Wall-E. It's a shame that Pixar chose to play it safe and focus on  the touchy-feely aspect of the story instead of truly exploring armageddon and teaching kids (and adults too!) about recycling, sustainability, and taking care of the Earth.	4.0	superb animation, but not as impressive storyline	2008-07-03	7	3	4

Was there ever a hero as valiant and brave, dedicated and appealing as Wall-e, the little tractor that could?The early scenes of a post-apocalyptic New York City are brilliant. Then the scene shifts to the spaceship where humans now live.I don't want to get too deep but I found the satirical vision of these obese humans stuck in their seats, allowing computers to do everything for them, a little too close to reality.Perversely, it's left to the robots to teach humans how to love -- how to be human.Great movie!	5.0	Should delight children and adults alike	2009-05-31	3	2	1

First of all it's way too slow in the first half, would have made a better short, then the two robots, Wall-E (Who looks like a Gamecube with wheels) and Eve (WOW That's deep.) go aboard a large ship filled with all fat an lazy. Gee Earth is polluted and everybody's fat! How heavy handed can you get. Why was this so highly praised? This movie is pretentious and dull. This would have work as a short, not a full length movie!I thought the music was somewhat interesting, other then that not to much to talk about. Bolt was much better then this, i absolutly LOVE Bolt! Now that should have won for best animated picture, not this overrated mess of a film.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1FMV4UYFOD6FE	A. lemay	Wall-e is a movie that any age can enjoy. It is entertaining and catchy for younger audiences, has very little dialogue in most of the movie, so it's easy to follow even if english isn't your first language. Beyond the eye popping visuals, quirky score and cute catch-phases (I dare you not to imitate WALL-E at least once after watching this show!), it also has a depth to the movie the older audiences will enjoy and appreciate.As for the product itsself, the digital copy that comes with it is very convenient if you have a psp or I-pod video. The only bad thing is that you get a limited amount of uses (for obvious anti-pirating reasons) to download onto a pc, which, if you format your harddrive or have a computer problem, can be a bother. The special features are great, including a short about one of the minor characters in the movie, and the animated short that was shown in the movie theatre before the actual feature presentation.

Although I do miss the classic days of Disney animation, this film is both visually stunning and heart touching. What they manage to do with a few sounds and robotic movements is just amazing. The movie is environmentally conscious (surprising for a film from a huge conglomerate) without being preachy. I find something new to take delight in every time I watch it.	5.0	Fantastic film	2009-08-17	1	1	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A23L2BR07AOBG1	alex bushman	"So much hype and praise for Wall E but there's nothing here to truly recommend it.  Lack of a main character or person to relate to is one thing that will alienate a significant portion of the audience.  Kids will watch anything, but I highly doubt that in ten years this film will be regularly watched by kids unlike the brilliantly attention keeping ""Finding Nemo.""  Making a robot exhibit human-like characteristics is not as easy now as it was back in the days of Short Circuit when people were less educated about AI.  In the days after movies have seriously dealt with robots, movies like ""Robots"" and ""Wall e"" are haphazard with the material.  Instead of this being about realistic potential of robots they're more about making robots as humanlike as possible.  They try to mask that in this one by making Wall e and Eve unable to communicate in human terms.  Robot love?  I think Cris Cunningham and Bjork are the only ones who actually got it right.  If Stanley Kubrick and Spielberb can't get it right, why does Pixar think they can? Animals and toys can be used because their exhibits of life are the existence of imagination and here there's no explanation for it.  Wall e is a trash robot who makes walls of trash, a trash robot acting human...was that in his programming?The bottom line is: why cheer for a cypher of human emotion when the gain for the audience and the character is more trash compacting?  The robot doesn't even get to be truly optimistic when human kind comes back, he doesn't truly have the robot he desires, she's probably just being compassionate as is programmed.  Someone needs to reprogram these Pixar writers, or at least go with different ones because this movie leaves you out in the cold."	2.0	A missed opportunity	2009-06-15	8	1	7
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1ZLFCUF4XX7RZ	Alex	I absolutely loved this movie. I watched it about 8 times before I had to take a break. It was just so cute, so fun and so different that I couldn't stop watching it. It's not your typical Disney movie. There is very little dialogue compared to a normal Disney film and in this robots are the main characters and not humans.I loved that it was a love story above whatever poltical reasons people were trying to assign to this movie. Sure it showed what rampant pollution can do to this planet and what a little care can do also, but that wasn't the main point. No, it was about love and how perseverence can win out over all.This is a family friendly movie. I took it to work and the children there loved this movie. So much a few cried because they couldn't finish it and some parents ended up staying just to watch it themselves.I wish I could give this movie even more stars than just 5.	5.0	Too Cute	2009-01-22	0	0	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1NJ558HAU8IJ6	"A. Lynch ""The Magic Dragon"""	"First, the feature; Wall-E continues Pixar's impeccable habit of making great movies. They slipped a bit with Cars, but many a studio would kill for Cars to be the low point in their filmography. Ratatouille and Wall-E makes the second time Pixar has released back-to-back masterpieces, and, I think, ultimately, Wall-E may prove their best film.It is certainly the most unusual of the Pixar movies; The first thirty minutes or so are nearly a silent movie. The two main characters are machines who are capable of saying almost exclusively their own names and uninterpretable sounds. Yet somehow it works. The animation is spectacular, as always. Besides the technical aspects, how stunning it all looks (this movie makes the definitive case for upgrading to Blu-Ray, though I've not bought a Blu-Ray player and will be enjoying my copy on DVD), the movie excels in emoting through body language. Wall-E cannot speak, but his body moves, particular his ""eyes,"" in such ways that you always know exactly what he's feeling. It's stunning to watch. And that this movie is so unusual in some ways makes it Pixar's most essential movie. It does something very old in an entirely new way.I could throw plaudits at the movie all day, but I would be remiss if I did not mention the packaging. The last two Pixar DVD releases have been a bit of a disappointment. The magnum opus was Monsters, Inc. The myriad bonus features were fascinating, engaging, and I still don't think I've watched all of them, though lord knows I've tried. Cars and Ratatouille were the only single-disc releases in the Pixar catalog, and their special features were lacking that certain something Pixar usually brings. I am beyond thrilled to report that the Wall-E 2-Disc set (the third disc contains the Digital Copy, and is not actually a DVD) is a return to fine form. The special features go in-depth about the making of this magnificent movie, and there's enough here to keep you watching for quite some time after the movie ends."	5.0	A Return to Form	2008-11-17	3	3	0

I won't go into the story because other reviews have covered that.  I do want to say that while the movie has an adult message and many small details that only adults will recognize and appreciate (much in way of the Shrek movies), Wall-E should appeal to all ages.  There's a robot romance and cute funny scenes that kids in the audience seemed to love, the animation is absolutely spectacular, and the story rocks.  As the credits rolled (you need to watch the credits for extra scenes) the entire audience applauded and cheered.Those who didn't like this movie because they saw it as a movie about fat people are truly missing the point.  While I'm heavy myself, I didn't get that from it at all, but thought that the fat people were to make the point that sitting around letting technology do everything for us will help make us overweight.A wonderful, utterly charming, heartwarming, endearing, and funny technological love story with a real environmental message, Wall-E is a keeper.

It's full of those adorable little moments that just make you go ""Awwwwww"" and make you laugh like you did when you were eight years old.At the same time, the writers threw in a little message (okay, a HUGE message).  We need to watch how wasteful we are, and we need to be careful with our reliance on gadgets.  None of us want to be like the humans in this movie!

The box is flimsy with the disc sliding into a scratchy cardboard sleave.The middle insert wouldn't pull out cleanly because of a flap of cardboard they put in it with a security chip on it (this got ripped off immediately.)  The middle insert doesn't even fit in the outer box correctly.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A17XMYGBT4UOZS	Amazon Customer	Pixar produces amazing movies, but WALL-E is for the ages. This original motion picture opens with WALL-E, voiced by Ben Burtt, making his way through a desolate wasteland that is our planet. Humans left 700 years ago because pollution and trash made Earth uninhabitable. WALL-E is the last Waste Allocation Load Lifter - Earth Class robot left on earth. His job is to clean up the planet, while the humans are away. Curiously enough, WALL-E developed a personality, skillfully communicated through emotional-laden beeps, whistles and other noises.Shortly after we're introduced to WALL-E, we meet EVE, voiced by Elissa Knight. EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) was sent by the humans to search for plant life on the planet. WALL-E soon finds himself enamored with EVE, who eventually reciprocates his feelings. WALL-E shows EVE a plant he has found and EVE shuts down to await the arrival of a ship to bring the plant to the humans. Faced with the possibility of losing EVE, WALL-E sneaks aboard the ship and in doing so alters humanity's future. You'll have to see the movie to find out what happens.Whistling, whirring robots...seems silly right? Well, Pixar produced a romantic science fiction thriller that is unlike any other movie created. Seriously, you will come to love these characters, feel their pains and end up rooting for their success. Kids will appreciate the story, and adults will understand the movie's nod to environmental issues, politics and the consequence of human complacency.This movie came out years ago, so what makes this one different?The only update is the artwork.The actual content is the same as the previous releases including the BURN*E short etc. The combo pack is made for region A, which includes Americas, East and Southeast Asia, U.S. territories, Bermuda.For all intents and purposes, Disney*Pixar is taking a blue-ray movie that didn't come with a DVD copy previously and adding a DVD copy. Disney is no longer including a digital copy like previous releases because eventually those codes expire. Current Disney policy states the unique digital code is good for one year from the release date of a movie. At this time, Disney is honoring expired codes. Disney needs to eventually phase out versions of their movies with expiring digital codes or change the expiration date for codes, so future buyers don't get upset if a code doesn't work.The fact the combo contains blue-ray and a regular dvd is an incentive to purchase if you have have a dvd player in one room and a blue-ray in another and you want flexibility. Perhaps you're like me and you have a blue-ray player at home, but you bring DVDs on the road for a hotel room or your laptop. Or you are looking to upgrade to blue-ray in the future.If you're in the market for blue-ray, the combo dvd/blue-ray discs,Wall-E (Three-Disc Blu-ray / DVD Combo)is actually a $1 cheaper than the blue-ray disc only product,Wall-E (Two-Disc and BD Live) [Blu-ray].	5.0	An Original Masterpiece	2011-05-23	56	52	4

They made their recommendation based on the amazing digital effects.  However, the story is basically a propaganda film, trying to make children believe that capitalism is ruining earth and that pollution could become such a problem that earth is uninhabitable. It's too bad that Disney has decided to buy into the liberal idea that companies don't care about people or the enviroment.Besides that I found the movie rather boring, since the robots don't really talk to each other, and most of the scenes are brown or grey.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1R4MW0H0K3S6F	A. Moore	"Wall-E, as presented in the Blu-Ray format, shows the full muscle of what the latest format in video technology presents. Disney's Pixar holds no punches when it comes to using the best compressor codecs and as such the results are stunning. The images are clear and ultra-crisp, even on my LG 52"" LCD TV.The only quirk that I have is a conglomeration of technology issues which comes down to the fact that on my laptop I have HDMI output and normally it can't output to my TV any Blu-Ray content. It is called HDCP protection and is a pain in the butt for home viewing. AnyDVD is a product that allows you to watch Blu-Ray content outputted to your TV through your existing HDMI connection so it basically allows the HDCP protection to work with your devices. Wall-E along with other movies are encoded with Dolby DTS-HD audio, which even with the best software out there, is no match for the HDCP protection. It will output the video portion of the movie and the sound will stay on my laptop.But with all the technical jibber-jabber aside, this 3 disc version of Wall-E is probably one of the better releases that Disney has. The packaging is professional and looks good stacked up with the rest of your Blu-Ray/DVD collection. So if you are trying to show off your new big-screen TV and have Blu-Ray capability then Wall-E is a fine addition to your movie arsenal.

It is well-imagined, with lots of fascinating ideas and settings, and it is all captured on film nicely.*Production design is wonderful.  The settings are vivid, the robot characters are cool, the spaceships are cool...heck the whole thing is cool.*The story is great.  It has some touching romance scenes, as well as some thrilling peril.*Characters (by which I mean the robots) are good.  Like Charlie Chaplain (who was an inspiration), Wall-E has a lot of goofy slap-stick moments but is still charming and adorable.  Eve was interesting.  Their relationship resembles most other human relationships that you may have seen on (or possibly off) film, and they managed to make it believable.  Other characters are great too.*Writing is sufficient (although limited).*There are many strong themes throughout (see below for the more questionable ones).  The most prominent thing is that people have lost touch with themselves and the world, and by the end of the movie, they rediscover their roots.*Music is not bad.The Bad Things*&lt;file not found>The Questionable Things*The movie has some very strong ideas and themes about the state of humanity and its direction for the future.  It portrays a lot of excessive commercialization (although without being too condemning) and excessive pollution (which is very condemning).  Many people seem to have taken offense to the portrayal of people (or specifically Americans) as being fat, lazy, and ignorant.  The filmmakers say that this portrayal is not intended to be offensive or condemning; it was simply a natural effect caused by prolonged multigenerational spaceflight.  You will either see these things and get all mad, or you will nod in agreement, or you will just laugh at it all.*No dialogue for the first twenty minutes or so.  Some people seem to find this aggravating.  I don't mind myself.I never thought another Pixar movie would come along that would be better than ""Finding Nemo"" or ""The Incredibles,"" but now I would say that ""Wall-E"" is my new favorite.  It has gorgeous imagery, from the decadent ruins of Earth to outer space (which is great, because I don't think there are many movies that can capture these kinds of settings so effectively).  It is a wonderful story with lots of thought-provoking ideas; it manages to be cute and awesome at the same time.  Above all, it is a kind of science fiction that we generally don't see in movies too much anymore; it's a classic variety that reminds me a lot of the works of Isaac Asimov or Arthur C. Clarke.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	Granted, I still have a lot of movies to see, but how it could get any more heartwarming than this is beyond me; and since I don't generally flock to those type of movies I think it's safe to say that this may be about as heartwarming as I'm going to see.  That said I think I should fill you in a little bit on my thoughts going into `WALL-E' before I tell you my take on the film.My best friend raved this movie.  He said that it was the greatest animated film he'd ever seen.  In fact, the world raved this movie, claiming it to be heaven-sent almost.  That hype scared me a little.  I hate hype, because it preordains a response from the audience.  If you invest in hype then you walk into a movie expecting to adore it, and if it falls short of your expectations in even the slightest way you walk away disappointed.  If you are the type to disregard hype you can walk into a film actively looking for reasons to rip it apart because you don't want the critics to be justified in their raves.The best thing to do is ignore everything and everyone until you've had a chance to see the movie and process it for yourself.So, with that said, I walked into `WALL-E' expecting to be let down.  Supposedly this is the greatest animated film ever and so I was expecting it to fall short of that praise and become just another overhyped mess that I didn't `get'.You know what; I got it.  Sure, this is not the greatest animated film ever.  This isn't even Pixar's greatest animated film (`Finding Nemo' anyone) but this has just as much spunk and just as much heart as their other offerings (minus the abomination that was `Cars').  What starts out as a beautiful look at loneliness and love transforms before our very eyes into a smart and satirical look at consumer waste and the deterioration of our society.  In short, `WALL-E' is a very interesting and poignant look at humanity and the innate desire to `live'.  Beautifully constructed and crisply animated, `WALL-E' is a splendor to watch and a film that will captivate and astonish you at times.  My daughter got bored and went to sleep (the slow sweeping silent scenes in the films beginning, while moving to adults, may be boring for small children) but I was engaged throughout the entire film.The film tells the story of WALL-E, a small waste management robot who has been scoping up Earth's trash and disposing of it for years while humans have been getting fat and lazy on cruise-ship-like spaceships for hundreds of years.  When a robot named EVE is sent to collect any living specimen from the desolate planet the two robots meet and form a relationship.  When EVE is taken back into space WALL-E follows her and sets himself up for a crazy adventure that makes him mankind's most unlikely hero.My one pet-peeve with the film is the fact that (SPOILERS PEOPLE) almost every robotesque film feels the need to go the route of, say, `iRobot', where the robots take over because they think they know better than humans.  It's just a little tired in my opinion, but whatever, it's not a huge deal.  There is rarely any originality out there today, and for the balance of the film `WALL-E' is very original, so it can afford to `go there'.I loved it.  I won't `rave' it as the best of anything.  It won't make my final five this year as far as `Best Picture' goes, but it is truly beautiful and an entertaining family film that parents and children (not too young) will really enjoy.  Hype doesn't always do a film justice, but this time hype is at least mostly justified.	5.0	Probably the most heartwarming, feel-good movie of the year...	2008-12-29	2	2	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3EW4TUSY1HAXC	Andrew Mcdonald	Before watching this movie I heard rumors that Wall-E is too dark for kids. It is not. If this is a dark film then E.T. is as well. The truth is this film is much much better suited for little kids than other truly scary Disney films like Snow White and Pinocchio.Like all great films, it takes risks. In the first half of the movie there is hardly a spoken word of dialogue. Some people are going to be turned off by this, but there is plenty of communication going on through facial expressions.It's strongest aspect is, without question, the animation. And though I'm not an expert in this, Wall-E feels like a revolution in animation. I absolutely love the effect of some parts of the screen being out of focus and others being in focus at the same time (for example, the background being in focus but the foreground isn't just like a real camera sometimes does). There are some scenes that are so well made that I had to remind myself that it was computer animation!After animation, I would say the next most successful thing is the love story between Wall-E and the probe robot Eve. These two robots can hardly say anything more than each other's name but in every scene I was able to decipher what each robot was feeling and trying to do/communicate. I've heard that most of human communication is non-verbal and I guess Wall-E underscores that.The most surprising thing about Wall-E is it's not a comedy, which is what most Pixar films are. Though it does try to make you laugh, that doesn't seem to be their top priority. There is A LOT of slapstick comedy but it's more cute than funny. Strange as this may sound, the opening skit involving a magician and a rabit (which lasted only a few minutes) got more laughs than the entire Feature Presentation.I don't think this makes it a lesser film. It's just that I think it has a different set of goals. And people who buy/see this film should not expect to laugh themselves silly. But they can expect to stare in wonder at some of these fantastic scenes. My favorite scene is when Wall-E and Eve are gliding through space (if you've seen it, you'll know what I'm talking about). There's something about that moment that's so simplisticly beautiful. I wish that all movies had at least half of the imagination that went into making Wall-E.This might be the best science fiction movie since E.T. It certainly is the most ambitious.	5.0	Few films dare to let imagination run as wild and unabated as Wall-E does	2008-07-06	6	4	2
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A236W67L9RPFOF	Andrew S. King	"Maybe Pixar's best.  I love the movie as a consumer of film, but I also use it in a Comp and Lit course at the college level along with Ayn Rand's Anthem and H.G. Wells's The Time Machine as part of a thematic unit on literary representations of future consequences of human/societal decision-making.  On a less geeky note, Pixar lately has become very, very good at conveying story, meaning and emotion without hitting the viewer over the head with obvious dialogue and otehr forms of gross unsubtlety.  ""Up"" featured an 8-minute dialogue-less montage that, in one Facebook poster's opinion, ""did [emotionally/narratively] in 8 minutes what ""Twilight"" failed to do in four entire novels/films.""  ""Wall-E,"" on the other hand, goes its first 30 minutes or so with absolutely no words exchanged, other than ""Wall-E,"" ""Eve,"" and a couple of non-word synth-voice emotional outbursts.  The movie's opening scenes are more an extended form of interpretive dance, a high-tech take on old silent movies, but the story is as clear as if it were narrated by an omnipotent outsider narrator.  Amazingly well done.  The story itself is a touch unsubtle -- like Avatar, or, for that matter, almost any other Disney film -- but for that it can be forgiven.  Where it cannot be forgiven, if anywhere, is that in its unsubtlety, it is easy for many viewers to come away with the wrong message.  Most people I talk to think the movie teaches us not to shop at places like Wal-Mart, and not to over-consume.  (""We're just using and using and we're destroying the planet!""  How simple and shallow!)  On the surface, yes, it seems like a generic ""green"" criticism of man's overconsumption, gluttony, unthinking and selfish destruction of the environment as a result, etc... But that's just a red herring; that's just the vehicle used to convey the film's real message.  The real moral is the hell that Man descends into when he relinquishes his own destiny to apathy, convenience, laziness, and allows himself to be fed what he is convinced is all he needs by an ostensibly benevolent master, like a hamster in a cage sipping from a drip bottle.  In this, Buy-N-Large is not really a representation of Big Box retail (how superficial and obvious!) but of a Socialist-type government a la Rand's Anthem -- which in the process of having convinced the citizenry that they no longer need to be proactive and act in their own self-interests because they are ""taken care of,"" causes them to atrophy to the point of no longer even resembling fully functioning human beings who once possessed rational thought -- or of a futuristic stage of human de-evolution such as are represented by Wells's Eloi, where their total mastery over all human ills and societal/natural hazards has led society to the point where it no longer thinks it has to continue to develop itself, and all science, technology, education, and industry cease, leading to a reverse-evolutionary process of the weakening of the species itself.  If Otto (Auto) the captain's bot is Rand's society's government, then the fat floaters of the Axiom are the Eloi, and the *heroes* are the people who re-learn to think individually, break free from the herd mentality (something which none of the Eloi are ever able to do, but which Prometheus, the hero of Anthem, is), and take control of their own destiny -- the captain, even John and Mary.  The irony, that it takes a pair of semi-sentient robots to remind us what it means to be human and truly alive, recalls the final scene of Karel 'apek's ""Rossum's Universal Robots,"" and places ""Wall-E"" as the latest in the long and proud tradition of dystopian science-fiction pieces of literature -- yes, LITERATURE -- that teach us -- not to avoid shopping at Wal-Mart -- but to be rationally self-aware, proactive in our individualism, and to (occasionally) learn to bite the hand that feeds us."	5.0	Amazing literary piece of animation	2012-05-20	1	1	0

I have heard that it was supposed to be very good, so I was expecting a masterpiece. The graphics were cool, but the story was boring. Even though Wall-E was the main character, in the climax Eve saved the day. Eve is another robot that is supposed to be a supporting character. Wall-E was a character that always needed saving from Eve. I give it a 8 out of 10 for the graphics, and 6 out of ten for the story.

It was clean, wholesome, family fun.  Pixar did a GREAT job and should be commended.  They should take note and make more inuendo-free movies.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A32T2H8150OJLU	ARH	"OK, just in case you haven't seen this movie or heard anything about it, here's a quick intro to the storyline (no spoilers):Earth has become so polluted that people evacuated to luxurious space cruise liners.  In the meantime, back on earth, trash-compacting robots work to collect trash and stack it in an effort to clean up the mess left by the now gone overconsuming population of humans.  When the movie opens, Wall-E appears to be the last functioning robot.  He's been doing his job for a long, long time, and in that time he developed a personality as he watches a tape of the muscial ""Hello Dolly"" over and over again.Then, things get tense when a mysterious spaceship lands...Interestingly, the good folks at Pixar put together a storyline that includes character AND plot development without relying, for the most part, on dialog.By the way, my favorite parts of hte movie are the roach, and the scene when you hear music from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (just watch, and you'll see).I believe that some people may find this movie to be too ""Pollyanna"", but let's face it, this is one of those rare high-quality movies produced mainly for children.  While it does have an appeal for more mature audiences, it's main target audience is children.  I appreaciate the fact that there are no wise-cracking or crude characters like those in movies like Shrek, etc. (animated movies that use animation, but are not really made for children).I appreciate the work of Pixar in applying their trade to a fun and engaging show that can be enjoyed without reservation by children and adults alike.Afterthought:When I started writing this review I considered awarding this product 3 or perhaps 4 stars, but once I started writing, thinking about my experience and the experience of my family wtih this movie it wasn't long before I realized that it truly deserved 5 stars.  With that being said, I want you to know that I do not award 5 stars to everything...something has to be truly good (in my opinion) to warrant a 5-star rating.Thanks Pixar!  5-stars!"	5.0	A completely wholesome animated show that actually targets children, refreshing - Thanks Pixar!	2009-01-09	0	0	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A32Y55Z00QI12S	ARK	"I like Pixar. I think they consistently make good movies--good in terms of narration, character building, and animation. The Incredibles is one of my favorite movies, and I thoroughly enjoyed Finding Nemo and Toy Story 2. I wanted to like Wall-E and I waited to be blown away.Now even I think that the Pixar hype has gone to a silly level. This movie is NOT the best movie of 2008. It's not the best of anything, with the exception of its animation--which does not, can not, make a movie succeed all on its own. In fact, what this movie ultimately reminded me of was a Pixar television special that was about 68 minutes too long. Wall-E's biggest problem is that it was overwrought.The basic plot is that humankind has ""made too much trash"" (killed the Earth with their blasted industry and consumerism, those cads) and has blasted off into space to hang out on a spaceship, teeing off and drinking slushies. Meanwhile, down on Earth, little Wall-E units work hard every day to clean up the trash. Let's zoom through 700 years to the present day. That's when we meet our intrepid hero, an adorable Wall-E robot--arguably, the last of his kind. Apparently, he's been working for centuries (one of several ""um, what?"" moments), fixing himself with spare parts. Over the centuries, he has developed individuality and a personality; he is friends with an adorable cockroach and collects interesting junk in a trailer. He happens to meet a probe called ""Eve"" who has been sent to Earth by the star-bound humans for a secret purpose. He falls in love with her. They have an adventure. Will Eve return his affection by the end?So is there more than that? Well, uh, technically... no. It's a love story between two robots and yet another preachy narrative about how terrible humans are at taking care of the environment. Oh, Wall-E is cute and instantly lovable, absolutely. The intermittent slapstick is laugh out loud, and the animation glitters. The problem is that it's an incredibly basic story with incredibly basic characters and yet another obnoxious ""save the environment!"" theme. I was bored out of my mind most of the time.What Wall-E really reminds me of is Studio Ghibli films, which I suppose shouldn't be a surprise, thanks to Mr. Lasater's closeness with Hayao Miyazaki. There's a quiet, understated, delicious kind of optimism about Ghibli films--most characters are inherently good and cheerful, and everyday life is infused with magic. Wall-E attempts to capture this same pleasant spirit and fails miserably, veering into hateful saccharine territory instead.The problem is that the characters in Wall-E have been dumbed down. Whereas Ghibli's characters generally tend to be complex and flawed--heck, just as the characters of The Incredibles and Finding Nemo were complex and flawed--Wall-E's characters seem just... stupid. Obnoxiously stupid, obnoxiously one-sided, optimistic only because they are incapable of feeling anything else. When human beings of the future see Wall-E--this filthy, antiquated little machine--they show no surprise at him and ask no questions about his appearance or why he's there. Wall-E simply bumbles from one mishap to another, unwittingly teaching little ""life lessons"" (ugh) to random people and robots, none of whom seem capable of thinking on their own. It's like a series of bubbly Pixar shorts, plot be darned. Heck, there is only one ""villain"" to surmount--and it's not a particularly impressive one!Add to this some heinous dialogue (""Get ready to have some kids!"") and some very blah character designs for the humans (all of the fatties look alike, even those of different races... whatever happened to the fantastic character designs in previous Pixar films?), and you have a very bland movie indeed.Am I really supposed to believe that human beings don't ask questions in the future and that they lose all of their intelligence? That consumerism blinds them all and that they all turn into miniature Jabba the Hutts? Yes, I know it's supposed to be a light-hearted judgment at Americans and consumerism in general. How very cutting-edge of them! This has only been the judgment thrown at Americans for at least twenty years.My favorite silly moment in this very short-sighted movie is the future portraying the humans' return to Earth, which is shown during the credits. A utopia featuring a green and flourishing Earth is seen. Humans are seen fishing with the help of robots, farming, etc... but no factories building said robots are shown, no energy sources for the robots, no houses for the people. Is Pixar serious? With technology comes waste. Heck, with human life comes waste. So it has been ever since the first human set foot on this Earth, so it will ever be. Anyone showing otherwise is painfully short-sighted and ignorant.Enough of this mindless eco-babble already! We all want and need nature and we need to take care of it, but we all want luxuries and need technology, too. There should be a happy medium; there probably never will be. Hey, I have an idea to chew on--where would Pixar be without the trucks and planes shipping its movies to movie theaters all over the world? Or the cars and SUVs that its animators drive to work every day? Or the movie-goers who drove to theaters to watch Wall-E, the trucks that delivered that popcorn they so blithely bought? This is arm-chair preaching. It will affect nothing. It only feeds into the same well-oiled machine it hypocritically decries.Here's another thought. Who did they make this movie for? If it's for kids, it's too long and boring for them. If it's for adults, it's too simple. Commercials seemed made to appeal to the younger crowd, which was misleading. I'm honestly shocked people DO like it to such an incredible degree.All this movie is is a heavy-handed morality tale related in a series of frustrating Pixar shorts, headed by a cute little robot who simply can't carry the weight of it. Some movies, like Ghibli films mentioned beforehand, manage to teach these themes without effort. After watching My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away, you want to see pristine forests; you want to make sure the rivers are clean. My Neighbor Totoro inspired the Japanese to set aside a special reserve of pristine forests and it didn't have to beat anyone over the head with Captain Planet theology to do it.I don't need or want lots of action or explosions or shiny things. All the Ghibli films I've seen and enjoyed do not rely on heavy-handed plots, for example; they rely on delicate, delicious character development. That's why most of them succeed where Wall-E fails; Wall-E is just not that complex. It offers nothing that hasn't been seen before. It goes from point A to point B to point C, character unchanging, simply adorable -- as though cuteness and slapstick could carry a 98-minute long movie!I hope Pixar moves forward and makes something a little more substantial next time, hopefully with the deep characterization I loved in Finding Nemo and The Incredibles."	2.0	Overrated, Passing Amusement at Best	2009-01-05	44	27	17

Wall-E is just one of those staple films, such as Toy Story and UP, that I will always look at as a PIXAR film. Yeah, I know Disney had stuff to do on them also, but come on.No downside to this DVD. You either love it or you don't. No walking the fence. The silent era comedy is back with the ability to tell a story with music, and virtually no talking from the main character.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2PN65B6BSTIYZ	B. A. Chaney	"As my husband and I were going into see Wall-E tonight a police officer who was in front of the movie theatre said to us ""You'll love it.  I loved it, my mom loved it.  You'll feel all the emotions there are--laughing, crying, everything.""  I was a bit skeptical that an animated film could really have all of these things--not just shadows of adult emotions--but I was wrong, she really summed it up.My husband and I both really enjoyed Wall-E.  It didn't matter that there wasn't a lot of dialogue or that the humans were portrayed in an unflattering light (no Disney Princesses here!).  All of the emotions were displayed through the actions of the characters, and the animators did a wonderful job of creating a powerful narrative.That being said, I don't know if I agree with the reviewers who say that this is a good movie for kids.  Like last summer's Ratatouille, which my 4 year old niece said was ""gross"", Wall-E lacks lovable, cuddly characters, and is filled with the underside of life, in Wall-E's case, lots of trash leftover from human consumption.  The couple of children that were in the showing I saw seemed bored during key parts of the movie (they were probably about 3 and 7) and afterwards were complaining to their parents.I would recommend this movie to adults and older children, but I would caution parents of very young children that this may not be the movie for them.  This is more than a kids movie with adult themes, it is an animated adult film."	5.0	Wall-E is a Great ADULT film	2008-07-08	6	4	2

While the whole setup of humans being morbidlly fat on a spaceship is comical, and Wall-E's voice is cute. However it just is lacking something other Pixar movies have. It lacks the humor and charm that Toy Story and Monsters Inc has. If you are a huge Pixar fan then this is for you but if you expect it to be like Toy Story or Monsters inc, its not so great.	4.0	Great movie but not as good as other Pixars	2014-01-17	0	0	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	ANGH6401L9Y0T	"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93"""	"This story literally made me cry! I mean it! Not from how adorable Wall-E is, nor his ""girlfriend"" Eva, but when we finally get to see what's become of the human race after some 700 years in space, waiting for the earth they trashed to become inhabitable once more . . . well, I cried.You see, one of the reasons Wall-E was left behind when they evacuated was to clean up the mess. The mega-corporation B&L; (wait until you find out what that stands for) had basically turned the planet into a consumer world, and when it got totally full of garbage, they thoughtfully built one (or more) space ships to take the population into space while the B&L; robots cleaned it up. Then they sent out probes like Eva to see if the planet had recovered.Apparently the work did not progress too well, because Wall-E was the only one left in what looked superficially like New York, until you get close enough to realize that most of what seemed to be skyscrapers were actually huge stacks of compacted trash that Wall-E had stacked up just for nowhere else to put them. Wall-E has carved out a niche for himself, collecting various artifacts for their curiosity value. For example, he has an old VCR on which he can play ""Hello, Dolly."" A couple of songs from that soundtrack make up an important part of Wall-E's soundtrack. He watches humans singing and dancing and holding hands, but he really doesn't know what it's all about.Until Eva shows up, that is. Her design is some 700 years in advance of his, and she's pure white, basically egg-shaped, and terrifyingly powerful. Wall-E looks like a beat-up trash compacter beside her, because that's basically what he is. Still, they make friends, and when Wall-E gives Eva a spindly little plant he found growing in the trash and carefully potted in an old boot, she goes bonkers. Turns out that signs of photosynthesis was what she was sent to search for.The way Wall-E manages to hitchhike on the ship that picks her up, and what happens in the B&L; floating pleasure palace when they arrive, is the best part of the story, and the part I don't want to ruin for you. Pixar designed the whole thing, and you know by now what geniuses they are. It's completely amazing how much personality they manage to pack into the robots which are most of the movie. So I'll just encourage you to enjoy it."	5.0	A Wonderful Anamated Story With Real Heart	2012-05-14	1	1	0

Things start to happen on the spaceship and Eve the other robottries to help him get back to earth.In the process, Eve starts to care for Wall-E.It is kind of silly for robots to fall in love, it kind of shows kids whatit is like for adults when they start to have feelings for another person.In not as graphic a way as an R rated movie would show.I think it is a cute way to show kids about feelings.	5.0	Wall-E  is quite the romantic.	2009-01-31	0	0	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3FNM10HK26EEB	"Barry G. Mcdermott ""enoptiayeh"""	"Pixar has done it yet again. Just when I thought Ratatouille was the best Pixar film, they release Wall-e.*SPOILERS BELOW*Wall-e is a story of what earth will be like in the future. All the humans have up and left. The only ""living"", more like functioning, thing left is a robot named Wall-e. But in the end Wall-e is very alive for everyone. He is a lovable character that will sway almost any heart. This is Pixar's first film to experiment this much. For Pixar to include live-action humans and to make this a silent film was very risky. But who better to do it than Pixar. And they do it perfectly. The film is very adult themed, but with enough to talk to children and present them with the future they will have to take on. Some reviewers have claimed this is a liberal themed movie, but I couldn't disagree more. Yes, the Ceo of 'Buy 'N Large' does say 'We must stay the course.' But I think Pixar is showing one corrupt mind and how he handles the most difficult situations and many politicians are that way and many are not (both liberal and conservative), and many people in charge of a huge company are that way and others aren't, and average people you meet on the street are like that and others aren't. They claim it to be like Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth. And so what if it is, even though it isn't. This was not a documentary, it had science fiction, comedy, and romance, which correct me if I am wrong, An Inconvenient Truth didn't. Yes, both movies have a similar theme, but so what. It isn't a bad theme. I know for a fact Al Gore said his film was neither liberal or conservative, it was for humanity. That is exactly what Wall-e is. A film for humanity. Yes, the movie does portray humanity in a negative way, but a negative way where as a race they have lost track and need to come back to reality. The film portrays humanity as a community that can come together and overcome what seem like impossible situations. When times are tough or some have lost their way, we get through it and help one another. This is Pixar's first film that is so heavily adult themed and has the best message for the oldest people and the youngest people. This is one of three PERFECT films of 2008 so far (behind my personal favorites Speed Racer and The Incredible Hulk).And yes I did mention above how this is my favorite Pixar film. Every year Pixar does this to me. After I saw Monster's Inc. it was better than either Toy Story movie. Then Finding Nemo came out and that was wonderful. Of course the following year The Incredibles came out (which could be my favorite Pixar movie at my heart of hearts because I am such a superhero movie nerd). Then Ratatouille came out two years later and there was no way it could ever beat The Incredibles. Well it did! And now Wall-e has done it, beating Ratatouille. And here is my reasoning. Every Pixar movie is great and Brad Bird could be my favorite director for them (although Andrew Stanton could be equal and possibly better). But this movie had one of the best messages ever in film and they succeeded and surpassed the expectations and the risks. To be able to keep children, teens, and adults enthralled in a silent, sci-fi, romatic, comedic film with live-action is incredible and without a doubt perfect!"	5.0	Wall-e, the PERFECT film of 2008 (Behind Speed Racer and The Incredible Hulk)	2008-06-28	8	5	3

If you can stand the fact that Wall-e says ""WAAAALLLLEEEE"" about a million times, and the fact that Wall-e is not exactly the most cuddly character, because he is well, a metal box with a Johnny-5 head, then this movie might be for you. Oh and he acts more like a 5 year old kid, so if you like 5 year old love then I would recommend this movie. The black comedy sequences that are so common in animations these days were sub-par in this one. The one good thing about the movie though was that I admire the concept of people leaving the earth so that it can be cleaned up and we can return.. or so we thought! That was kind of clever and brings some realism to the story. Its always enjoyable to see what the future of humanity is going to be like, but this one was a little too cheesy.If you haven't seen this yet I'd recommend seeing it just to say you saw it, but if you're a grown man like myself, don't buy it, just rent it.

Don't be quick to judge this as something just for children, for there are plenty of adult overtones amidst the simplicities of emotions and feelings [that a child could relate to]. I'm an adult and I think this is one of the best animations I've ever seen, both visually and emotionally. Labeling it enjoyable wouldn't do it justice.Wall-E is a fun, lovable robot whose directive (a term you'll find used quite a bit) is  just to compact trash. That's it. Compact trash again and again. But this little guy has a personality and cute mannerisms that will allow you to appreciate his character more than you would expect. It doesn't matter that he can't speak - you'll love him. As expected with Pixar pictures, our protagonist is introduced, then faces a difficult situation, successfully deals with said situation, and a happy ending follows. The plot slightly suffers when Wall-E faces his obligatory difficult situation, but the visuals barely save it. Prepare for an ending of gratification.	5.0	It doesn't matter that he can't speak - you'll love him	2008-07-03	7	4	3

Yes, the animation is awesome, but everything else is just...bleh.The first 5 or 6 minutes just have Wall-E and a couple cute visual gags that I just smirked at but overall it was kind of a boring start. When he meets a new robot Eve, it gets a little better, but overall nothing really happens. When they get into space, you see more robots and we find out that all humans are living on a spaceship and everyone is fat. Then we get a small chase scene, a little bit of action, but overall it's very forgetable. The last twenty minutes are the best part. I found my self crying for a character that I hardly cared about (How the heck does Pixar do that?!), and it's a happy ending. But really, other than the last twenty minutes, this movie is very boring and kind of confusing at times. I smiled at a couple gags, but nothing was really LOL funny. Now I know, sometimes you have to have a serious movie that can't really have LOL moments, but there's serious, and there's just plain boring.Also, this is almost a green movie. Really Pixar? Don't get me wrong, I care about the enviornment, but I'm just tired of all this green stuff getting shoved down our throats.This is when I started losing intrest in Pixar, and it's next film (Up) is a little better but not by much. Overall, it's worth seeing maybe much, but really if you don't see it, it's not much of a miss. However, the short Burn-E is hilarious!

We have a wonderful 42"" HDTV and a Sony Playstation 3 for viewing and previous Disney/Pixar titles have received the royal treatment when it had come to their hi-def renders.  Wall-e is no exception to that!Wall-e is such a beautiful story of a lonely robot who is called up to fulfill a great mission and save the world in which he has spent decades working tirelessly to maintain.  The dialogue in the movie is minimal and so much is conveyed through expression and movement.  I think this is one of Pixar's finest that everyone should go out of their way to see at least once in their lifetime.In terms of picture quality, Wall-e is a movie that pays great attention to even the most minor details.  The animation is so good that there are moments when the viewer will have a difficult time discerning animated textures from real ones.  Comparing this film to Pixar's first digitally animated feature, Toy Story, it is incredible to see how far animation has evolved in less than 15 years.This blu-ray is great because it comes packaged with a DVD copy, which is great if you have a DVD player in your bedroom or in the car.  I like this combination sets and I appreciate that Pixar has gone out of he way to include a DVD so that those wanting both are not required to purchase the same movie twice.Another perk of Pixar (and Disney, for that matter) blu-rays is that each title is packaged with a Disney Movie Rewards code.  You can enter these codes at the DMR website to redeem them for points which can be put towards free merchandise.  Unlike many other programs, it does no take long to accrue points and I have already redeemed a few different free movies."	5.0	One of Pixar's finest!	2011-09-26	1	1	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E	B. Martin	The films churned out by the creative team of Disney and Pixar are so routinely excellent, that we're starting to expect greatness from everything they do.  It's going to come as quite a shock when they finally come up with a dud.  At the rate they're going, that may never happen.Their latest achievement is Wall-E, an innovative and largely entertaining gem from director Andrew Stanton.  The plot is simple.  In the future, a trash collecting robot called Wall-E spends his days, with a cockroack as his only companion, diligently woking at his primary task of cleaning up the mountains of garbage left behind by the human race who are now circling the galaxy looking for a new planet to colonize.  Wall-E's life is simple but lonely until he meets Eve, a probe droid sent to earth to search for plant life.  Our hero falls for Eve and whe she returns to her ship, he follows determinedly after her.The film has won critical praise for both its storytelling and its artistic ambitiousness.  It is a love story, a revisionist form of silent films (at least for the first 20 to 30 minutes) a satire pointed directly at our consumer culture as well as a cautionary tale about the potential results of our resource depleting lifestyle.  The movie also incorporates live action into the mix and doesn't rely on any big name celebrities to provide the voice talent.Yet I don't quite see Wall-E as the work of staggering genius that some claim it is.  The satire and political commentary aren't as subtle and clever as the movie's creators think they are and the movie seems to lose a little bit of steam when it shifts its focus from the love story between the two robots to the efforts of the humans to rise up against their sedentary lifestyle and the machines that are trying to keep them that way.  Still, there's no denying the magic and charm of this film and ambition is never a bad thing.	4.0	Disney and Pixar triumph again	2009-01-02	1	0	1

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2ATWKOFJXRRR1	"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com"""	"It is my understanding that director Andrew Stanton (along with screenwriter Pete Docter) had a couple of ideas that came to fruition prior to WALL-E. Things you may have heard of like, oh, Finding Nemo andA Bug's Life. Wall-E was the final ""idea"" in the animation pipeline for Disney/Pixar and it is obvious to me why this was so after watching it. Let me explain...Let's start with the aforementioned Finding Nemo. Here was a story that was 95% focused on the main characters: fish and those around the fish (crabs, seagulls, pelicans, etc.). The dentist -- a human -- was a side-story; a vehicle for the plot, sure, but he wasn't what the film was about. The audience became enamored with Marlin (Nemo's father) and his adventures to find and save his son. Again, a great character scheme that got the audience attached to the title character and his father (and we can't forget Dori, the forgetful sidekick).Moving ahead several years we get to Wall-E, a story that isn't so well-formulated as far as characters go but has a decent message at its core: the survival of our planet.If the story had stuck to Wall-E's adventures and his need to connect with someone (anyone!), the story would've turned out just fine. True, the decent message may have gotten lost but film makers need audiences to feel empathetic toward the characters, and that's where Wall-E short circuits. The humans don't come into play until 20-plus minutes into this 98-minute feature and then we're completely given over to them and lose sight of Wall-E altogether ...for a while. This extreme detachment from the title character made the film feel more like two separate ones than a consistent whole.There are, however, some profoundly funny moments ...and some just plain profound things, too. Fred Willard (Date Movie) is the first human we see (but only through billboard displays) as the loathsome Shelby Forthright, CEO of the BnL corporation. His last name is a cautionary note to not trust someone just because of their name. John Ratzenberger (Ratatouille) is John, an Earthly human in an un-Earthly ship where his every whim is cared for by automatons, turning him and his spaceshipmates into worthless sloths (another cautionary note to not let computers or technology run rampant over us). The spaceship's computer voice is probably one of the funniest of note, because it's narrated by Sigourney Weaver (The Ice Storm). Anyone who's seen theAlien seriesandGalaxy Questknows how Sigourney's previous characters feel about computers.Better known for his sound work in the more recentIndiana Jones 4flick, Ben Burtt lends his electrified voice as the main character, Wall-E. Although not much speaking takes place from Wall-E's standpoint, he does have some human moments of loneliness and tenderness (once another mechanical being arrives). EVE, Wall-E's love interest, is also electrifyingly voiced by voice actress Elissa Knight (she was Tia in the other Pixar hit,Cars). Her arrival on Earth heralds new hope for Wall-E that his life of loneliness might come to an end.Despite all its character and whiplash faults, Wall-E is a movie of environmental importance. It shows us what we as humans might do to the only planet we can call home, and what might happen if we allow ourselves to go too far in damaging her. That, at the very least, makes this a watchable film."	3.0	Doesn't Come Close To Other Pixar Flicks...	2008-11-18	27	4	23

Some people may be hesitant to watch due to the lack of dialogue, but I LOVE IT! The movie just works...it flows smoothly and is adorable - it also has a great message to our bigger-and-better culture.I loved the three disk copy...it isn't that much more expensive than the one-disk and you get a lot more. It has silly extras from the making of Wall-E and special shorts from Buy-n-Large. I haven't used the Digital Copy yet...I'm waiting to get a better video-playing Mp3 device.The one thing about this copy that I wasn't impressed with was the packaging. It came in this flimsy, strange cardboard case instead of a normal plastic DVD case. It makes the disks hard to get out and there is nowhere for the instruction (for the digital copy) paper to go. I am careful with my DVDs, but I have a feeling that this particular case is going to wear out very quickly.All-in-all, this is a great copy to buy if you have seen Wall-E and love it.	5.0	Pixar's Crowning Moment	2009-05-05	1	0	1

The catch is PIXAR has done an extraordinary job of portraying emotion through these robots.  While saying nothing, they effectively convey paragraphs, without the aid of human facial expression.Everybody I know who has seen WALL-E has been taken in by the main characters and thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie.The rest of my posting is a note of the social commentary and everybody's interpretation of it.  In a nut shell - Many people leaving posts seem to interpret the take-away message of the movie as ""Overweight people are typically lazy and uninterested and attached to tv screens.""  I think the message is actually the reverse: ""lazy and uninterested people who are attached to tv screens typically end up overweight.""  Details Below.....There is a running theme in the movie, that I interpret as : If we all continue to increase our ""plugged-in"" time, we will not end up in a very favorable state.  By ""plugged-in"" time, I mean time spent surfing the internet, watching television, text-messaging, playing computer games, etc.A prime example was when humans in the movie were next to each other, they still talked via video-conferencing using their personal screen/camera.  Thus they never actually had to interact with anything but their personal screen/camera.  I fear this may be an all-to-real commentary - I have seen a drastic increase in the amount of time people spend ""plugged-in"" over the last 10 years.The next part of the commentary: the unfavorable state.  The humans in the movie are all overweight.  They move around in portable chairs, eat all their meals via milkshake, and appear to be quite unintelligent.  I take this to be the direct result of too much time spent sitting in front of a screen.  I acknowledge that not everybody who sits in front of a screen all day becomes fat, lazy or unintelligent, but nobody can argue that time spent in front of a screen (unless you are watching something educational/historical/fact-based) is going to improve health, energy levels or mental acuity.It makes me sad to read the many posts where people cite WALL-E as a bad commentary with the message ""fat people are lazy unintelligent blobs.""  I think it's a chicken and egg thing, and I do believe that people who are lazy and inactive tend to get overweight, while people who are intellectually uninterested in thinking and learning will normally not show very high mental abilities (since they do not exercise their minds!).Some people have argued that children will take away the message that overweight people are lazy and stupid.  I'm not really qualified to determine that.  I would guess that it will depend on age and upbringing."	5.0	An excellent, captivating story with some social commentary on the side	2008-11-15	6	5	1
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2S0DU8QTQSKWK	Brendon Spencer	"but for a movie put out in 2008 it is pricey. You would think it'd be down to $13 or $14 by now.To the movie: I've seen it a half dozen times and it still never fails to get to me. The animation itself is well done, the storyline exceptional. Before 5 minutes are up, you've already fallen in love with WALL-E and want him to get his lost love. The, uh, ""courtship"" between WALL-E and EVE is hilarious. I crack up over the shopping carts every time.Not to give away too much and spoil it, WALL-E is alone on the garbage heap known as Earth, except for his roach companion. A space ship shows up with a flying robot, EVE, here to check for plant life. WALL-E is immediately smitten and works to get her (it's??)attention even if it means following her wherever she/it goes.Is it worth the inflated new price?  Probably.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AVOCNUFOXUCA6	Brian A. Schar	"I saw ""Wall-E"" some years ago on an airplane flight, and it caught my attention from the beginning.  Pixar managed to tell a story where there is virtually no dialogue in the first half of the movie, and only 2 characters.  Three, if you count the cockroach.  And, yet, it works beautifully, like a modern CGI silent movie.  The dialogue begins once the movie reaches about the halfway point, and we enter the _Axiom_.  The artwork and direction is outstanding, and the story held my interest.  The environmental thing is a little annoying, but living in the Bay Area,  I'm somewhat inured to green-y hectoring as background noise, so I just filter a lot of that out.  Plus, how can you not love any movie that has a ""Rogue Robots!"" alert in it?My 2 year old didn't enjoy it as much as me.  She didn't hate it; she was simply bored by the first part of the movie due to the lack of dialogue.  Unlike ""Nemo,"" where she ran around for days afterward demanding to see ""Nemo, Nemo, Nemo!"" over and over again, I didn't hear ""Wall-E"" or ""Eva"" at all after the movie was over.  ""Wall-E"" isn't inappropriate for a 2 year old by any means, but may be just a little over their heads.  It's great for adults, but you may want to wait until your kids are 4-5 if you want them to enjoy this."	5.0	Entertaining film but not ideal for toddlers	2009-07-20	2	1	1
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1YGK0HCYA5QA3	"Brian ""B-Man"""	"Being a professional in the 3D animation and games industry, nothing interests me more than the next Pixar feature.  Even more than that, I think I get more excited about the animated shorts they show at before the feature.Now, my review for this is going to be a little biased because this was the first film I ever saw in Blu - ray.  I popped the disc into my new Sony BD350 blu-ray player, eventually the menu comes around, and I am already sucked into the sharp, vibrant, and colorful HD picture on my 40"" Samsung Plasma.  I couldn't wait any longer - I hit play, the Pixar logo animation plays (sharp as ever), the movie start playing...The animation is incredible.  The rendering, texturing, lighting, color, complexity and completeness of the environments - all amazing!  I especially love Wall-E's little shack for a home, the huge piles of trash (must have been an interesting problem to solve on the animation/modeling technical side), and that massive ""Axiom"" space ship.After being blown away by the movie, it's time to check out what's so great about this blu-ray technology as far as content and menus go.  First of all, navigating through all the menus may be intimidating for the average movie watcher, but once you get through it a bit, it's pretty awesome compared to the old DVD menu navigation.  Right away, I found the magician animated short (one of my favorite shorts ever), and the Burn-E short, a little extension of the engineering robot's story.After those shorts, I worked my way to the content I always look for on an animated DVD - ""fly-throughs"" of the all the main digital sets and layouts.  It will fly you through Wall-E's home, the Trash area on the big ship, and everywhere else in the movie without characters.  This I absolutely love, because you get to enjoy the beautiful crafting jobs of the modelers and designers at Pixar without the distraction of story or characters.  This may sound weird to the norm, but as a 3D enthusiast, this is my favorite part - admiring the artwork of the extremely talented artists at Pixar.There was a whole thing when this movie hit the theaters - you either loved it, or hated it.  Personally, I can't anyone disliking Wall-E.  Yes, there is no talking of any kind for a while, other than Wall-E and a cockroach, there isn't much character interaction.  But I think that is the brilliance behind this film.  If they can successfully tell a good story, siphon  emotions, and build credible character relationships with the lack of speaking, and just the interaction of the main character with it's environment, you've got incredible writers, animators, artists...Wall-E is just another incredible story to add to the Pixar library of greats.  They have not failed in quality yet, and every year I wonder how can it possibly top what it did last year.  Now, we get to enjoy the digital greats in it's uncompressed HD glory.  I now look forward to their 2009 release, UP(also a preview on the blu-ray disc).Buy Wall-E (on blu-ray if at all possible, it's even got a digital copy so you can watch it in high-def on your PC).

Boy, I didn't know what I was in for.I've returned 3 copies to Wal-Mart now.The movie would skip and freeze, occasionally losing the sound afterward for a few seconds throughout the disc. The odd thing was how the skips occurred at almost the same places on all the discs. I really want to blame the horrid packaging for this movie. The feature film disc was more of less free-floating in the case, a wondrous cardboard concoction that barely holds the disc in place. This applied to both the singe and three-disc versions of the movie.Another problem with this I found out in my efforts to return the movies. Disney has the backing of some sort of federal law (that no one could ever really explain to me) keeping anyone from getting their money back from this movie (and probably others they distribute as well). It took 3 returns and a lot of complaining to some low-level employee to get them to break the rules at Wal-Mart, just to get store credit. It didn't get me what I wanted but it's better than being screwed out of my $30 outright.	1.0	What is Disney thinking?	2008-12-04	13	5	8

This film is the better of the two. In spite of the fact that the characters are machines, this is a great love story between WALL-E, a trash collecting robot and EVE, a reconnaisance robot. As a reverse of the situation in modern film where we have humans acting like machines - if you call it acting - here we have machines acting human to the point we forget they are machines. In addition, we have a satirical look at the future that doesn't look that impossible or that far into the future, at least as far as the possible state of the earth or humankind is concerned.As usual with Pixar films, there is something for everyone. The adults can enjoy the love story and the sly social commentary, and the kids will enjoy the fun and adventure that is in every Pixar film. I thought Pixar had outdone itself with Ratatouille, but here they've pleasantly surprised me again."	5.0	One of the two best films so far this year	2008-08-29	9	8	1
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2X6T0LVG2TZ76	Capt08	I purchased the 3 disc Special Edition with the digital copy.  For those of you buying this set, you probably won't get the digital copy code included in the package (I didn't).  Since this movie came out in 2008, digital codes are only valid 1 year after the movie was released on DVD.  I was dissappointed to know that an Amazon merchant was selling this product showing that it could be viewed on a portable device when in fact it cannot since the code would be expired.  I went ahead and emailed Disney to see if I can get the code and to my surprise within an hour the Disney guest services team apologized and emailed me a code.  Worked out perfectly.  I did not have to return the set.  Here is the link to request a code from Disney:[...].For $14 you get the DVD, Wall-E short film extras and a digital copy.  It's not a bad deal.  If you happen to get a code with your purchase and it's not working then definitely use the link above for a replacement.  You will need your digital copy disc that came with your purchase in order to download the movie. Both disc and code are needed to download the digital copy.My son loves the movie and now he can watch it on the go.  I'm a happy customer.	5.0	Fantastic!  My son loves it.	2011-07-20	0	0	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A11SPSEM08VIXX	"Carbonadam ""Ladies and gentleman, I hope that..."	WALL.E SPOILER ALERTWALL.E, the latest from Pixar is another amazing film. How they manage to churn out great film after great film is anyone's guess. When every other studio manages to just recycle old pond scuzz, they consistently produce gems, time after time.WALL.E is a science fiction film that has an eco message imbedded within. The film does not attempt to sway your view or convert you to agree. It simply tells a tale, a very good tale, and then the film ends. If you do not care to see the message the film does not care. Nor do I imagine do the filmmakers for that matter.The story, as is usual for PIXAR, is a multi-faceted one. If you are a simple child there are simple laughs. There is also a simple very easy to understand story of friendship, companionship, love, or what ever you care to call it, between the two main characters, WALL.E and EVE. The more complex side story is: what happened to all the humans? For a while one can imagine some great garbage catastrophe. We quickly learn humanities fate. We left all the garbage behind and are off in space aboard some cosmic cruise ship. I have heard that cruises are notorious for all the food that is provided. Once we find humanity we see what has become of them. FAT.E is all that comes to mind. This is not hard to imagine. Drinking a burger through a straw. I bet some genius is already hard at work on that one as I write.I love all the references in the film for those who are old enough to get them. Kubricks 2001 is riding shotgun in this film and when this comes out on DVD it will have no better home on my shelf than beside 2001. real science fiction is not about space cowboys, it's about small, or grand, intelligent scientific ideas that propel the story forward. The idea in this film is what will become of us. I'm sure the film has the broad strokes right. Just like the Kubrick/Spielberg film AI, this film imagines a future where robots are everywhere. I can easily buy this. We are headed in that direction right now. Just a few hops, skips, and jumps before we crack that next big nut and grandma is being cared for by medi-bot. This was the profound part of the film.It is still, at it's core, a kids film. My son laughed his WALL.E off while he was watching it. I laughed too, although the theater was mostly quiet at the bits I found hilarious. EVE destroying a dozen oil tankers and seeing them topple like dominoes was one great bit. The fat captain standing up (probably for the first time in his life) to the music from 2001 was another.In the end the film simply ended. It had no grand hidden secret, or any huge complex message to unload. Take care of the Earth, try not to eat too much. Most of what I took away was that love is the most important thing we have, and our loved ones help define us. When EVE, kisses WALL.E in the end and her electric spark gives him back his memory, (soul) I was impressed. Simple yet effective.I know from Cars that these films need more than one viewing to let them sink in properly. This is not Flushed Away, Bee Movie, or Shark Tale, This is a PIXAR film and it should stay with you long after you go home.I rarely do this any more with hardly any film, but I may use my son as an excuse to see this film a second time. Beyond being just a great story, it was also beautiful beyond belief. The music was also very well thought out. It was nice to hear some rather unconventional songs in this film. I will surly be getting the soundtrack and score.WALL.E was also the most human character in the film. I love when he finds the box with the diamond. He tosses the flashy diamond and keeps the interesting box. WALL.E is right on. Scrap the flashy bling and go for the simple more useful things, and pleasures in life.I could go on forever about this film. Just see it. You'll love it.	5.0	WALL.E is the last human alive	2008-06-28	9	6	3

Plus, the fact that the Earth is no longer capable of support life is interesting yet a little dull at times.I like the movie and I give it thumbs up, but Disney/Pixer needs to up their standards on the production of the DVDs they release to the consumer markets.  I have had nothing but problems with my copy of Wall-e on my Blu Ray player.  It's stops and freezes randomly throughout the movie which really ticks me off and I do not have that issue with any other blu-ray movie I own.  I have even tried to clean the lens in the player.HOWEVER, Blu Ray player owners need to remember that on most Blu-Ray players (mine is Sony) you can upgrade the Fireware to the latest version which helps with load speeds, compatibility issues and software bugs soooo please check with the support site of your Blu-Ray player manufacturer.  The latest Sony is from 10/31/08 and they typically release new version about every 2 months so keep up with it.  Sony provides a disc image that you will burn to a CD and then you place it in the disc player and it upgrades.  Its very easy.	3.0	Good movie - Defective DVD/Compatibility issues	2008-12-06	7	6	1

Well, it is a children's movie, but it is an adult's movie, too. There are so many adult issues touched on in this movie, I was pretty surprised. There is no nudity, no language not suitable for young children; no situations not suitable for young children. Wall-E is a blast to watch, it is fun, it is sad, it is 'boy meets girl, boy falls in love, boys loses girl,' etc. It is so fun to watch you are sorry when the movie is over, and you wish there is more.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2CVP31XTYSZFE	"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom"""	"Of all the references that come to mind with the phrase ""robot love"" Wall-E must be about the most cheerfully innocent  - as well as being the most inarticulate for the first half hour or so. Laboring tirelessly away for seven hundred years among the ruins of some unnamed Earth city,  compacting endless mounds of trash into neat cubes and stacking them up in orderly rows, Wall-E is hard-working, but creative and after a long exile with no other companion but a cheerful little cockroach - about to fall in love with his robotic Eve. Who really is named EVE - a sleek white survey `droid, come venturing back to earth to see if it has become fit for humans to return from centuries-long exile on a luxury space ship run almost completely-run by robots. Computer animation allows the `look' of Wall-E to be as visually rich as any three classic Disney efforts put together - the piles of junk on earth  are all individual, and detailed to the nth degree. Wall-E is as endearing and sympathetic a character as has ever been made from a mechanical object, shyly courting the object of his affections and following her back into space and defeating the machinations - literally machinations - of  the robotic first mate of said luxury space ship. Because EVE is bearing a secret with her... but that would give away the plot, such as it is.One of the most creative aspects about this release comes at the very first; the packaging of the set itself; entirely in light card-stock, which admittedly may not wear very well - but it has the holders for the three discs slide out in panels from each side - a very clever and retro space age in design, as well as being ecologically sensitive. The persistence of garbage is one of the points of this movie.The extras are generous, including a whole additional disc with the movie in digital version. Of the expected extras, the most amusing (and cringe-inducing) are the shorts about the inner workings of the Buy n Large Corporation, and the `bot files - all about the various service robots who do the work that humans have apparently moved beyond doing. (They have moved beyond anything except being zipped around on something that resembles an animated barca-lounger, and expanded accordingly.) One interesting feature was about how the robots were designed; apparently all kinds of current technology was studied for insights into how to make Wall-E convincing and believable.This being Pixar,  the outstanding extra short  ""Burn-E"" - about a continually frustrated maintenance robot - is right up there with the space aliens in ""Lifted""."	5.0	Robot Love	2009-06-02	2	1	1

I did feel lonely during that time! The whole movie was painted in rusty color. There's only Wallee living in that city, no human being, no other robot. He compressed garbage by himself. He watched video by himself. He went to bed by himself. It's so depressing. It's amazing the director and animators can brilliantly express loneliness without any dialogues.The story is meaningful. It shows even robots have feelings. They also possess love! It also shows people can make mother Earth inhabitable with their garbage dump.The love story is cute and gentle. For example, in the scene where Walle held Eva's mechanic hand is so touching.

The story just seemed kind of bland to me. The world gets shot to hell and we have to live in space as fat people that can't do anything, and the only hope for our survival is a robot that has a plant. No offense here, but the whole movie seems kind of soulless to me. WALL-E, by the reference of the protagonist, is meant to just clean up trash his whole life for 700 years. What were we doing in space for that long without even bothering to send anything down to earth to investigate the Robot's progress? Why wait that long until you decide ""Hey, maybe we should check and see how our home is doing?"" Did it ever occur to anyone that at some point in time, you should have checked sooner before you became gelatinous blobs stuck in floating chairs? To show that I do not hate Disney movies, I have to say that ""Bolt"" was a far better movie than this. Disney was able to pull off something amazing without Pixar and I was extremely impressed with the results. Sure ""WALL-E"" will probably get into the nomination for ""Best Animated Feature"" on the Academy Awards, but it most definitely does not deserve to win. ""Bolt"" or ""Kung Fu Panda"" deserves to win it. Show the world that Disney and Pixar's tag team is not the only company capable of making award winning movies.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3OXHLG6DIBRW8	"C. Hill ""CFH"""	Wall-E is one of my favorite animated movies and an easy choice for the kids. The little robot Wall-E, is left with the monumental task of cleaning up all of the trash on the entire Earth after all of the human population evacuated on an extended cruise while waiting for the robot to complete it's assignment. Obviously there is a bit of an environmental comment here, but it really isn't the entire focus of the movie.This movie is actually romantic comedy adventure, with our hero becoming somewhat eccentric after plodding along with his somewhat hopeless task when he suddenly meets EVE (a VERY advanced robot) who seems somewhat out of his league. The rest of the story revolves around his attempts to find, save, and win the digital heart of his true love.The animation is top notch and the visual extras at the end are enjoyable.Highly Recommended!CFH	5.0	Just Fun - Highly Recommended!	2010-05-15	0	0	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A18G7GG53G2X8A	Chris Pandolfi	"Disney/Pixar's ""WALL-E"" is an absolute winner, not merely as an animated film, but as a film, period. It's not a collection of cute, shallow images and dime-a-dozen messages about self-esteem and friendship--this movie actually has something to say, and you can hear it loud and clear. It's funny I should say this, seeing as the story relies more on action and less on the spoken word. Yes, characters speak, but only when it's absolutely necessary; the rest of the time, our eyes do most of the interpreting. But that's perfectly all right because you don't need words to understand what's happening in this movie. Essentially, there are only two things you need to bring with you: (1) your understanding of basic emotional needs, namely love and affection; (2) the knowledge that we as a culture can do so much better if we finally apply ourselves. For all intents and purposes, these issues are addressed without getting preachy or sentimental.""WALL-E"" asks us to emotionally invest in a robot, which we willingly do, mostly because years of isolation have turned him into a big softy. It takes place 700 years in the future, at which point Earth is devoid of human life and buried under mountains of trash. Out of an army of service robots assigned to clean the planet, only one remains operational: a Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class robot, or WALL-E for short (voiced by Ben Burtt). Designed to compact trash into manageable cubes and pile them into skyscrapers, WALL-E is small and meek and just plain loveable, from his sorrowful scope-like eyes to his cute clamp-like hands. He would like nothing more than to hold someone else's hand, to spend his time and share his collected trinkets with that special someone. So far, his only companions are a pet cockroach and a VHS copy of ""Hello, Dolly!""But things take an exciting new turn when a spaceship arrives and dispatches a scout robot to search for signs of plant life. She's what's known as the Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, or EVE (voiced by Elissa Knight). She glides through the air gracefully, and her slender, pod-like structure can separate to reveal a head, a body, and arms. WALL-E is immediately smitten with her, although it will be a while before she warms up to him; their first encounter ended in laser blasts, courtesy of the weapon in her right arm. But after a while, she regards him with curiosity and actually takes an interest in the many items he's been collecting. This is especially true of a tiny plant he found growing inside a trashed refrigerator--the instant she sees it, she places it within her own storage unit and immediately goes into stasis. It isn't long before the spaceship returns for her. WALL-E, desperate to reunite with his new companion, clings to the side of the ship as it leaves Earth and travels across the galaxy.WALL-E eventually finds himself onboard a massive space-liner called the ""Axiom,"" which is where the human race has been living since Earth's evacuation 700 years earlier. The ""Axiom,"" as it turns out, is far, far too luxurious: every possible need is met with the help of a robot or mechanical device. Every person is incredibly fat, and that's because specially designed hover-chairs have eliminated the need for walking. All meals have been liquefied so the food doesn't have to be chewed. When they're not slurping down their lunches, they communicate with their friends and family via screen projections floating in front of their faces. Because of these screens, no one knows that the ship has a pool or a gym, and they certainly miss out on the majesty of an outer space view. Robots take care of simple tasks like tooth brushing and makeup application. How the people go to the bathroom, I have no idea, but I have a sickening feeling there's a robot for that too.Trapped within this lazy environment are WALL-E and EVE, who now have proof that life is once again sustainable on Earth. When made aware of the baby plant, the ship's captain (voiced by Jeff Garlin) researches the planet so extensively that he's compelled to return with the rest of humanity. The question is: Does everyone want to go back? Have they, in fact, become so spoiled and sedentary that going home seems like too much of a chore? While these questions are never directly asked, it does make you wonder what we would do if we were in that position. In a way, we are: meals are often reduced to take-out lunches and prepackaged dinners; Segway vehicles can take us from one place to another without getting our feet involved; we would rather text message our friends than speak to them face to face. Yes, I'm blowing off some steam, but don't focus on that; focus on the fact that this movie has the power to evoke these feelings.It also has the power to evoke feelings of tenderness and longing. This is no small task because ""WALL-E"" is mainly a love story between robots, and robots are emotionless by definition. For reasons I won't reveal, WALL-E and EVE find themselves in danger on the ""Axiom""; as they try to escape, their feelings for each other deepen so greatly that you actually get choked up during a couple of key scenes. I'm not saying that Disney and Pixar have made a sappy cry-fest--they've made an animated film with a strong emotional core, and they spread the emotions evenly throughout the story. It's funny, yet it doesn't drown in a flood of gags. It's touching, yet it doesn't lose itself to melodrama. It's thought provoking and the imagery is beautiful, yet it doesn't condescend, nor does it collapse under the weight of its effects. Not only is ""WALL-E"" the greatest Disney/Pixar film since ""Finding Nemo,"" it's also one of year's best films."	5.0	A Robot with Heart	2008-06-27	9	6	3

They have lovingly (perhaps, fanatically) advanced the art of animation like I've never seen before.  And I just love them for it.  I love all the Pixar films, own them and watch them over and over.  Each one appeals to me for different reasons, but they all give me such joy to watch.  Last year's Ratatouille stole my heart because I'm an avid cook.  Remy's my guy (excuse me, my rat!).  But Wall-e.... oh my god, Wall-e.  This little robot melts me into a pool of butter.  When I saw Wall-e in the movie theater, I was mesmerized by it.  You cannot watch this film just once because there are too many beautiful and subtle movements, gestures and sounds that you miss on the first watch.  I've been watching online videos and picking up all sorts of things I missed in theater.  I can't wait until the DVD is released.  I'll probably download the movie to my iPod, too.  That's how much I love this movie.  By the way, when I saw Wall-e in the theater, the audience was packed and it was mostly adults.  Bravo, Pixar!

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A356WGTOXZKN50	C.Jackson	I am really surprised that this movie does not have 5-Stars. I thought it was all-around perfect. I enjoyed the suspense, the romance, and the comedy too. It all mixed really well and the animation was great.The story is really cute. Wall-E is a robot with a somewhat lonely, monotonous existence on Earth where he collects junk and packs garbage that has been left all over the deserted planet. Then one day a spaceship lands and out comes a robot named Eve (who is referred to as EVVVVE-A throughout the movie). Wall-E is immediately enthralled by the persistently searching and destructive Eve and eventually becomes taken by her.This eventually leads him on a journey to the Buy-N-Large spacecraft where Earth's obsessed population now resides, where he and Eve find themselves in a situation where they must save the Earth.Eve and Wall-E really work well as a team in the movie and that is what I loved the most. Wall-E also is such an endearing character, he's scared but brave and also funny. I also was entertained [and slightly frightened] by the depiction of obese humans on the BuyNLarge ship. It seems to be a message about being overdependent and lazy because of technology. The way the earth went to waste also makes a message about people taking care of the Earth and making sure it does not get to that point. I liked that this movie did that but wasn't preachy about it. It didn't overtake the storyline.Bottom line, I highly recommend this movie for kids and adults. It's very well done.	5.0	One of my favorite Disney movies	2008-12-20	0	0	0

The story is probably one of the best of Pixar's excellent line, both friendly to adults and kids (who woulda thought a robot would be this cuddly).  The added bonus stuff is highly watchable - an extra short BURN-E in addition to the theatrical short, commentary, BnL commercials, robot specs, making of documentaries, and a history of Pixar.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AS558SNWF1DXG	Clare Quilty	"Here's yet another fine, fine film from the Pixar geniuses.It's whimsical.It looks beautiful and perhaps even more, it sounds beautiful.It's moving, even when there's no dialog, which is frequently the case. Lovely in its storytelling enough to make a viewer care about a cockroach.And it has a noble message which is: The earth will be a bad place to live if we keep messing it up.That's a highly worthwhile sentiments for a major motion picture to put forth and underline (um, somewhat repeatedly). But perhaps somewhere in the world's multiplexes was the child who, duly inspired, might grow up to save the planet and us along with it.So, a good movie. But you don't need me to tell you that because it's got a 96-percent FRESH rating from Rottentomatoes, which means only 4-percent of all the registered critics in circulation didn't like it.Salon's Stephanie Zacharek  said, ""The picture feels weirdly and disappointingly disjointed ... something that starts out as poetry and ends as product,"" and while I'm still positive on the subject of ""Wall-E,"" I think she's onto something there.So I have to drop just a couple of notions, and they are ....1) I am 96-percent positive on ""Wall-E"" ... while he's on Earth, when the movie is wry and wistful, cautionary yet happily optimistic. Once our little Woody Allen-esque load-lifter stows away to the starship Axiom ... it falls to more like 65-70-percent.2) I would've found Wall-E's pining for Eve a lot more touching if the story had given us just a little more time between them, just a little more connection. They do start to form a bond before she's, er, called away, but they're not there yet. And he follows her to her workplace and causes trouble? As it is ... Wall-E could conceivably be seen as a kind-hearted interstellar ... stalker, sorta, albeit facetiously.3) So we have the fictional retail behemoth Buy-N-Large, clearly patterned after Wal-Mart and big box stores like Best Buy. I find it charming that the good folks at a little mom-and-pop operation like Disney will warn us about the dangers of massive, omnipresent corporations and the wasteful folly of excessive consumerism.I feel certain, too, that in about six or seven months time you will be well-notified of your ability to purchase the double disc ""Wall-E"" DVD at those very same retail chains....4) Over-eating and obesity is a huge, active issue. But as I watched the movie have laughs at the lazy, bloated passengers of the Axiom, I found myself worrying about the big boys and girls in audience, too young to make their own nutritional decisions, who might think the movie was teasing or even bullying them. And I wondered if the movie's creators had considered that possibility and shrugged it off. And I worried that I might be navel gazing just a little too much. It's always possible.5) The end was a cheat. It was lazy. Worst of all, it was dishonest. Those big guys ain't gonna grow no plants. As presented by the movie, they're not the right people and that ain't the right place. They are the hippies in ""Easy Rider,"" and they will try to grow corn in sand.6) Lastly: The opening scene -- Wall-E happily buzzing around a wasted city to the tune of Michael Crawford singing, ""Put on Your Sunday Clothes"" -- is one of my favorite scenes of the year.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"Pixar has been one of those animation studios that you could nearly say has a perfect track record. While everyone has their favorites and even ones that were marginally liked (such as ""Cars"") will still be defended by some so it seems like it should be any day now where they make that one film that everyone agrees it's just not up to snuff. Well keep waiting since ""Wall-E"", their 9th so far, not only continues their streak of perfect family movies that literally everyone can enjoy but it's become one of their best too. This film, along with for me ""Toy Story"" and my favorite ""The Incredibles"" ranks as the top they've done and this is easily one of the top films of 2008, animated or not.It's 700 years into the future and mankind's wasteful habits have gotten the better of them and Earth's pollution and high amounts of trash have forced the planet to relocate on what was supposed to be a five-year trip while the ""Buy n Large Corporation"" would supply WALL-E's, or Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Earth Class, which would clean up the mess and allow the population to return. 5 years turning to the 700 we're at now, all that's left is one little Wall-E unit still functional and doing his job while also containing a private collection of goodies he finds along the way. But when he finds a plant and a spaceship containing a robot known as EVE arrives, the adventure takes them into the vast reaches of outer space as they attempt to get the populace to return and even learn how to love.One of the bigger gambles Pixar did with this film is to have the bulk of the film without dialogue except for the occasional word spoken by Wall-E or Eve and many wondered whether this would sustain the kids attentions. I'm not sure about the kids since I never really saw them watch but it sure kept my attention. In fact, it's such a testament to the talent at Pixar that their storytelling has evolved from having one-liners spouted and in-jokes frequently that they can tell the story visually and everybody can follow along. I loved it so much that when the story takes a different turn and starts introducing more characters and dialogue, I didn't really lament it but they were doing so great with near-silent filmmaking that for them to go ""okay,back to normal"" was slightly disappointing. However, the film has a whole still works largely thanks to the 2 main characters and the emotions Pixar brings out of the 2.Similar to how he did the sounds/dialogue for R2-D2 in the ""Star Wars"" films, sound designer Ben Burtt basically electronically altered his voice to supply Wall-E's mannerisms from that frightened tremble to the ""whoa!"" and even EVE's voice is perfectly suited for her and I actually started to just imitate them for the fun of it (""Eeeeee-vuh"") but also supplying voices is Jeff Garlin known from the ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" television show, Sigourney Weaver as the ship's announcer and of course perennial favorite John Ratzenberger also returns. The music is actually quite delightful and one dance performed by the 2 is made the more magical by that whimsical piano piece playing in the background. Since sound is just as important in a film and not relying on dialogue as much is also a factor, the voice acting as well as the sound and music is perfect.But then as I said in title, Pixar just seems to be miles ahead of the competition. Whereas others mainly focus on better and sharper textures to smoother animations, Pixar always seems to improve in many areas at once whenever they do a film and from not only the character animation and expressions but the gorgeous Axiom ship interiors, the wastelands of Earth and the space shots, they don't just slouch and make certain things improved, they seem to attack every area from lighting to textures to photorealistic environments, ""Wall-E""'s Bluray is a perfect showcase for your new Bluray. Strangely though, they took a page from that dancing penguin movie and added real-life footage which is predominately starring comedian Fred Willard and while it works in the film, it's odd seeing an animated human watching a real-life human on video.Wall-E is touching, heartfelt and while it was a gamble, it certainly paid off and not only is it a good science fiction story, it's an even better love story so this one's highly recommended."	5.0	There's Pixar and then there's the rest	2008-12-30	1	1	0

Wall-E is their latest contribution to the world of animated features, and again they have raised the bar.  The film is beautifully animated, with a wonderful story told through compelling characters.  A formula, you can tell, that Pixar cares about and they continue to have success.  The first half hour contains very little dialogue, but manages to capture deep emotions through sounds and body language.  If you appreciate a good animated film, Wall-E should not be missed!The 3-disc special edition contains featurettes on the making of the film and an excellent documentary on the birth and evolution of Pixar studios.  There is also a digital copy so you could watch the film on the go, or during a flight.	5.0	Another amazing film from Pixar	2008-12-14	0	0	0

I hate to use this clich&eacute;, but this is a ""must"" for Blu-Ray fans. You have to see - and hear - this film in HD because it is a great treat for your senses. The surround sounds are everywhere while the colors and artwork are something to behold! And, yes - it's still very pretty on a regular DVD, too.The story is ""cute,"" but nowhere near the visuals and audio. It's okay, subtlety humorous, dramatic and romantic parts. It gets a tiny bit preachy with the usual environmental digs and a comment about how fat we humans can get by lying around too much, but otherwise just plays it for comedy and cool-looking characters. Everyone and everything in this film is pretty amazing-looking.It's kind of a strange story, with much of it taking place on a big space ship. My favorite parts were in the beginning on Earth with the little robot WALL-E and his cockroach friend.There is so much to see in this film, it makes multiple viewings all the more attractive but, I'll assume, you're always going to catch some things you didn't see the first few times."	5.0	Absolutely Stunning B-D Visuals & Audio	2009-06-26	1	1	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	This is a fabulous movie.  You don't need any qualifiers for it being animated, a robot movie, or anything else.  It is simply a terrific movie.  The story opens in a desolated city where a lonely little trash compacting robot (WALL-E) simply does the work he was created to do.  All his peers seem to have broken down long ago and he uses their remains for spare parts.  His only companion is a lone cockroach (one of the elements of the movie that requires the greatest suspension of disbelief - that is that there would only be ONE cockroach).  The scene is interrupted by a spaceship that drops off a sleek looking robot of immense power that seems to be looking for something in a rather fierce and impatient way.  WALL-E becomes enamored of EVE, but EVE is focused on her mission and it doesn't include WALL-E.  That is until WALL-E shows her a single green plant that he has found.  The rest of the story takes off from there and heads out into space.  You will have to see the movie to get the rest of the story.This first part of the movie uses very few words and yet we understand everything that is going on and become very emotionally involved with the characters and their situations.  I think that is quite an achievement and those who pulled it off deserve great praise.The rest of the movie is also very good and has some interesting things to say while it entertains us.  Just to cite one example, there is a little robot whose job it is to clean up every foreign contaminant it comes across, but it also has to follow its lighted path through the ship as every robot does.  However, WALL-E's dirty tread leaves foreign contaminant's wherever he goes and he doesn't follow any lines.  At one critical moment the little cleaning robot must choose between its purpose to clean and its directive to stay on the lighted path.  Its choice is instructive, I think and one which we all face at different points in our life.A fine family film, but has as much for adults as it does for kids.  A memorable film that I think will last.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI	5.0	A fabulous movie - period.	2008-12-29	2	2	0

Go back and look at the depth of the stories in Toy Story or Bug's life--the humor and the grand themes.  The last 3-4 Pixar offerings are straight out of the worst of Hollywood conformity and unoriginality.  Are people confusing great animation with great stories?  Wall E was maudlin, predictable and Cars rewritten. Boy, car,  or male robot is lost--female of same type helps him find his way or himself.  Pixar has run out of good ideas, and maybe even ideas.  They are currently at the point where they need a new direction, having used most of the usual environments, space, ocean, nature, imagination, and industry.  They could try fantasy next.  Whatever they do, they need to  get rid of the tired formula that has taken them from ""infinity and beyond"" to mediocrity and the bank."	1.0	Pixar has been co-opted by Hollywood sameness	2008-11-28	51	8	43

I have enjoyed every Pixar film I have seen, until this monstrosity. If I tend to use the word ""torture"" frequently in my descriptions, it doesn't even come close to conveying how much I suffered trying to make it through the movie. Honestly, I should have walked out, but I kept expecting the pace and plot to pick up..it never did. This film is about as tedious as it gets.Imagine hearing two robotic, mentally-challenged voices repeating ""WALL-E"" and ""E-VA"", NON-STOP, over and over again...for what seems like 4 hours. I've just summed up ""Wall-E"" for you. That's it. That's the whole movie. Nothing more to see here.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AQCQ5F0OJXMG9	Crystal Starr Light	"I saw the trailers for this and was immediately interested.  A Pixar film about robots in the future?  Yeah, sure!  Bring it on!Wall-E is a waste management robot left on Earth to clean up the mess leftover.  During his time there, he has befriended a cockroach, built massive skyscrapers from the small blocks of garbage he has compacted, and collected a wide assortment of interesting objects left behind (a spork, lighters, and a copy of ""Hello Dolly"").His life changes when EVE, a life-detecting robot, is left on Earth to find any life.  Eventually, the two fall in love, but then EVE is whisked away to her ship when a plant is discovered.  The two then have to convince the overweight human crew to go back to Earth and finish the clean-up process.What is there not to like about this film?  The visual effects are gorgeous.  Dirt looks real.  Wall-E looks like he might even run today.  And this is only just two of the many, many beautiful details in the movie.  I enjoyed how the first part of the movie has no talking, just watching Wall-E as he worked and discovered new objects (a paddle ball, a rubic cube, etc.) and how he meets EVE.  The chemistry between EVE and Wall-E is very emotional--I never thought it would be possible to cry over two robots being separated, but I did!  The story is superb.  Yes, there is a message of humans destroying the Earth.  Yes, there is a message against consumerism. But these messages are soften when the humans realize how important other beings are, how beautiful the beauty of nature is, and how much they want to return to their home and change their ways.Wall-E is a movie that I think everyone can enjoy.  It is adorable, it is mesmerizing, and it is spellbinding.  After seeing all the other Pixar films, I loved this one the most.  Definitely worth seeing.Brought to you by*C.S.

Shaw ""vandalart"""	In today's world, there are not many ways we have come up with in terms of communication that does not include WORDS. In fact if anything, our society have come up with the most high tech, intriguing ways of communication using words such as Facebook, the I phone, and text/instant messaging. Saying this I must admit, that after watching Wall-E, I was more impressed with this film and it's achievements than any other film I have seen in the last few years.Without language, Wall-E achieved emotion, quirky personalities, and the development of friendship and love. ALL WITHOUT WORDS. Quite an amazing feat. I was in tears at the end of this excellent Pixar film and could not believe how incredibly attached I had become to Wall-E and Eva, the two main characters. I was astonished.Pixar has created a masterpiece that will be remembered as a true breakthrough in animation and I am so thrilled that children of today and tomorrow will be able to watch a film that has such vitally important messages about how to live, respecting Mother Earth, and being conscientious about your environment and community.Within this thoroughly entertaining film, there is such a unique message of hope for all of mankind. All the men, women, and children of the world have an effect on this incredible planet that we all depend on. It is a delicate balance that we must respect and continue to teach the next generations of how important it is to do our part, no matter how small - Recycling, turning off all the lights before going out or going to bed, donating used clothing and other products to organizations like the Red Cross and the Salvation Army. The treasured plant in the shoe that Wall-E finds and keeps is a symbol of how blessed we are to have such a beautiful and wonderful planet. The different vegetation and flowers, the animal kingdom, and the beautiful landscapes that differ from the golden deserts of the Sahara to the lush, tropical jungles in South America, to the beautiful blue-green of the Mediterranean Sea. These inspiring and realizations all came to me after watching this film. A+	5.0	A SILENT MASTERPIECE IN ANIMATION...	2009-01-14	4	4	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A77184QJM3PM	"C. Tolley ""Chris Tolley"""	What a wonderful movie. I really didn't know quite what to make of the previews, I mean, very little dialogue to be heard, and the main leads were robots. After seeing the film, I love it. The lack of dialogue is actually a bonus, as you focus on the mannerisms and actions, however small, of the main characters, Wall-e and Eve. Visually the movie is stunning. The vistas of a barren Earth are amazing and desolate. Space is an incredible sight as well, with the best space travel scenes since Star Wars. The story has a superb point to it as well, as the eco-friendly message is very timely and to the point without being preachy. Wall-e's yearning for companionship is palpable, expressed in his repeated attempts to simply hold Eve's hand. Pixar continues to do the near-impossible, hold your attention and make you feel empathy and affection for robots and machinery. There hasn't been this sympathetic and lovable a robot character in a film since R2-D2 in Star Wars. The attention to detail is amazing. Everything is extremely well-thought out and designed. The growth and development of Pixar's art is incredible. They tell the best stories, with the absolute best in animation, on the most consistant basis. No-one can do it better, as their track record will attest. The ending is superb, with enough emotional sentimentality to catch you, without being too overdone. All in all, this is a fine film, one of the best films of the year. It certainly deserved the best animated feature oscar it received, and I think it deserved a best picture nomination as well, as it presented a timely message with enough humour and emotion to get the point across. Get this fine film and be carried away to another point in space with Wall-e.	5.0	I Didn't Know We Had A Pool!	2009-11-19	0	0	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2RLK9KKVGEETZ	"C. Tsao ""Seaview1"""	Pixar has produced some of the best animation in the past decade with its computer-generated features (Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo) that have been marked by strong storylines and vivid characters.  The tradition continues in an impressive way with Wall-E.  This deceptively simple tale is transformed by the emotional content told almost entirely through visuals.A polluted Earth has become uninhabitable for 700 years, and one of its only residents is Wall-E, a small robot whose solitary mission is to be a mobile, trash compactor. In his work, he also finds and collects trivial, odd artifacts of mankind's past such as a Rubik's cube.  He comforts himself with an old video, Hello Dolly, and as he learns about humans and his yearning for love, it becomes his idyllic vision of happiness amid an insulated, dull existence.  Along his travels, he comes across a unique find, a live plant! One day a spaceship lands and deposits a robot probe.  Fascinated by this kindred machine, Wall-E follows and eventually befriends this unit known as Eve.  Eve has a directive that will hopefully return humans to Earth if only it can sustain life, and Wall-E's plant figures immeasurably.  Eve is returned to her mother ship with Wall-E frantically chasing after his newly found love.  On a spaceship acting as a living city for its machine-dependent, overweight humans, little robots are not only the caregivers, but in control.  Wall-E and Eve must figure a way to return the humans to earth and find happiness even if it means making the ultimate sacrifice.Wall-E's innocence and childlike wonder (think E.T.), as exemplified by how he introduces himself to everyone he meets, could almost have sprung from Steven Spielberg's imagination.  It's in the small details that enrich Wall-E as a character.  He brings to mind an amalgam of past robots like Star Wars' R2-D2 and the little robots in Silent Running, and his fears and joys are expressed through body language and squeals. When he shuts down each night to sleep, he rocks himself as a child would.  He is clumsy around Eve, and when he takes her to his makeshift home of robot parts and paraphernalia, he is like a little kid.  Ironically, he is the catalyst to bring the humans back home.Writer and director, Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo), takes a huge risk by basing the film's premise almost entirely on a song from Hello Dolly.  I can't think of an animated film that relied so much on visual storytelling.  Even Fantasia and Allegro Non Troppo were collections of musical sequences not narrative features.  In a way, this film is almost too sophisticated in its display and execution for little kids but is just right for adults.  Remarkably, this is a tale with nary a spoken word by the principals. One has to think of silent films to approach this achievement.  The operative word here is pathos like the best of Charlie Chaplin's little tramp and, amazingly, this film earns its stripes by emoting body language, action, and sound effects. Yet most of the characters aren't even human!Fred Willard has an amusing small role as the corporate president.  Sigourney Weaver, as the ship's computer voice, is an inspired choice since, like Eve, she was a female hero (in the Alien movies) and had to deal with computer voices in those films.  The animation is almost 3-D in its rich detail and simulated, fluid camerawork.  The interior of the mother ship, the Axiom, is a futuristic view of a commercialized (think Blade Runner) city in space.Yes, it is a thinly veiled message for all those `save the earth' and `think green' people, but that never detracts from the main theme of saving humanity amid a touching love story.  There are moments when you think a scene could have played out a bit better, but that is minor.  It is likely that Wall-E's reputation will grow over time as a shining example of stretching the art form by challenging and trusting its audience.  Bravo to the folks at Pixar for taking a chance and for entertaining and moving us.	4.0	WALL-E Brings Pathos to Computer Animation	2008-07-05	5	3	2

Not a day has gone by since we bought this DVD (shortly after Christmas) that we don't play it. Sometimes it's the only thing my son will watch, although he occasionally mixes things up withE.T. - The Extra-TerrestrialorFinding Nemo. What's funny--or maybe scary--is that he knew who WALL-E was before we even bought the movie. It seems to be helping him with his vocabulary, though: ""Wah-wee"" is his second favorite word (""moon"" is his first) and ""Eeee"" runs a close third.Each time I watch the movie I marvel at the Pixar team's skill at telling a story. I'm always finding new things to look at, and appreciating the elements they used to create a tale that is more than complete (the interplay between the computer's explanation of dancing and the scenes of WALL-E and EVE cavorting in space, for example).My major gripe with the DVD is that you're forced to watch (or forced to skip) about seven commercials for Disney products before you even get to the main menu, and then you have to watch two warning screens and another Disney splash page before the movie starts. It gets old very quickly.That said, WALL-E is well worth the price. It's top-quality entertainment for the whole family."	5.0	In constant rotation at my house	2009-02-04	0	0	0

Plot-wise...I know I am not in step with most people who have seen Wall-E, but to be honest I found the actual storyline to be a little slow moving, even boring a time or two. I think overall we have a winner here and it's worth buying, it's just that I don't join with anyone who places this atop Pixar's releases.The best moment in the movie? When Wall-E asks Eve about her ""directive"" and Eve first helps him pronounce the word and then takes a step sideways and announces, ""CLASSIFIED!"" An endearing little scene within a scene!

However, I've never watched an animated movie this well done.  Going by what else is out there, maybe I never will.  Apparently, there are people out there (or at least one that I saw) who didn't like this movie.  So...they're not human, and they're FOR SURE not robots, so what are they?  They obviously should not be allowed to reproduce.  Too late now - oh well.Anyway, everything that needs to be written has been, so lets just say I was absolutely stunned - watched it with my mouth open. I just couldn't believe the wonderful minds and talent it took to make this movie.OK, now my real reason for writing.  If these are reviews of moviemaking, why let people ruin a movie's rating by reviewing stuff like the box it came in, the art work on the box, didn't like the shrinkwrap, etc.  While some of the issues are legit, like receiving in bad condition or late or whatever, I still don't think this is the forum for that kind of review.  Why don't you folks handle these issues with Amazon?  Amazon has never ripped me off - they have always handled any issues in a timely and satisfactory manner.  If you kids still insist on making your whining public, maybe Amazon could have two catagories - one for moviemaking and one for customer service issues.By the way Amazon, feel free to compensate for my ideas - love your service, Babe!	5.0	Review Annoyance	2011-04-17	3	0	3

Who would have though a movie about a little robot, who does not speak (we don't hear human voices till well in to half the movie) would have worked, but it does. This is more of a love story then an action movie. It is about a the last trash robot on earth who falls in love with Eve, a probe robot who is sent out to look for organic life on other planets.I am looking forward to this on Bluray, it is going took and sound amazing.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AEQFYOI6YJ83Z	DanD	"I'm not much of one for animated movies; not sure why.  The only other Pixar offering I've seen in its entirety was ""Toy Story"" (I enjoyed it, of course).  But something attracted me to ""Wall-E,"" something about the simplicity of the story: A robot, stranded on an abandoned and (mostly) lifeless Earth, who develops human emotions.  Then, when another robot (EVE) comes in search of life, WALL-E falls in love, and eventually has to go on a quest to ""rescue""  EVE from a city-sized spaceship run by maniacal machines and inhabited by overweight, oafish humans.Well, in that context, ""WALL-E"" doesn't sound so simple after all.  And, truthfully, it isn't.  There's the delightful story, brought to life by vivid animation and ""vocal"" work; WALL-E is perhaps the most ""human"" animated character I've ever encountered (God, that's a cliche if I've ever heard one, but it's true).  This little robot says very little, but you are absolutely enamored with him.Then there's the subtext.  It's not very subtle, of course: It's right there in your face, with grotesquely overweight humans who can't even walk anymore, driving around obvlivious to the beauty that surrounds them.  It's in the billboards advertising Buy 'N Large, the company that first took over the world, dumped all its trash into orbit, then had to leave the planet when the environment became too inhospitable.  This is an anti-consumerism movie at its grimmest, much in the vein of the old Disney cartoons (which were often based on Anderson's fairy tales, but had a lot of Brothers Grimm in them, as well).The thing is...this movie is hopeful.  That is perhaps its ultimate triumph: Not only does the film make you fall head over heels for what is essentially a sentient trashcan, it planets a seed of hope in you, a ray of light amongst the trash-strewn world the film inhabits.  ""I don't want to survive,"" says a character, just realizing who he is.  ""I want to live!""  And you will, too: ""WALL-E"" is hopeful, powerful stuff.  It's also hilarious, heart-warming, and beautifully animated.  Watch it for the message; watch it because it's a good movie.  Either way, you're going to be entertained."	4.0	4.5 Stars--A delightful, thoughtful film.	2008-11-23	9	9	0

So why then does Pixar's Cars have 4 1/2 stars, yet Wall-E only has 4? Granted, 4 stars is a great ranking, but its not at fitting for Wall-E. This movie should have an average of 5 stars, but Wall-E should definately have at least a 4 1/2 star ranking on here.I don't know. I guess I would ask that if you feel the same way, could you go to the trouble of ranking this movie with 5 stars if you haven't already so we can get this averaged out?

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2Q4UG3ZVWU4YK	Daniel Spratlin	Two of my favorite things are Pixar movies and science fiction, so when you cram the two of them together into one film, I'm inclined to like it. I didn't; I loved it.Writer/director Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo) has continued Pixar's recent trend of making riskier, deeper, more meaningful films that kids love, but adults love even more (we should all have a passion as deep as that rat's passion for food). It's a fine line to walk, but they've perfected the art.The film opens with a flyover of a landscape of huge skyscrapers, but a closer examination reveals they're skyscrapers made of trash, thanks to the last inhabitant of Earth: WALL*E. He's a robot, built to take trash, smash it into a bundle, and build skyscrapers out of it. WALL*E may be the best character Pixar's ever created.WALL*E spends his days building skyscrapers, but also collecting bits of detritus and taking it back to his humble abode, to be played with and marveled at later. His prized possession is a tape of the musical Hello Dolly!,which he watches every night, pining for someone to hold hands with. These moments are touching and poignant--quite a feat for a robot. You can use these moments to discuss loneliness with your teenagers.His world is turned upside-down by the arrival of another robot--EVE--who's been sent on a mission for...well, we're not sure for a while, and I won't spoil it. She's sleek, modern, potentially deadly, and can fly-- the opposite of WALL*E in every way. So of course he falls in love with her! And what a love story it is. WALL*E gives up everything to follow the robot he loves, acting selflessly.Once he makes it into space, he meets humanity, but a different humanity than we're used to. These people are obese automatons, more interested in watching an electronic device in front of their faces than interacting with other people. Wait, maybe it's not that different...There's been much made about the film being a subversive political statement about environmentalism, capitalism, and many other -isms. I think that's merely a product of this being an election year, and modern media and the Internet's ability to create conspiracies where there aren't any. Is there a message about taking care of the planet? Yes. Is there a message about consumption run amok? Yes. Is there a message about the dangers of excess? Yes. That's not political; that's biblical. Besides, we mustn't be distracted from the movie's real message: hope and love.It's an amazing film, one I'll be watching for years. It's excellent science fiction filled with excellent characters, told excellently.BTW: Presto, the short Pixar piece shown before WALL*E is one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen. Use the bathroom before you see it or you might just go while you see it.	4.0	Cute and funny. What you'd expect from a Pixar animated.	2009-01-13	2	2	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3DGVB3T5QJNRE	Danny G.	"Wall-E is a surprisingly good film. It's touching, humorous, imaginative and quite subversive. Something you don't see too often in a children's film!I think this brilliant film makes three very important points. First, robots will someday become sentient (self-aware) akin to Data from  Star Trek or Hal from 2001: A Space Odyssey. What makes Wall-E so interesting is that a simple maintenance robot becomes self-aware,  unlike Hal or Data, which are the most advanced technology known within their  respective worlds. Granted, Wall-E's sentience took place over a 700 year period, but it makes one think if someday this could happen in the real world!Another important insight is the current plague of obesity Americans and many other technologically advanced nations are facing. What I found so fascinating was how, taken to an extreme, the ""Couch Potato"" lifestyle would play out in human evolution. Amazingly, humans were literally losing the ability to walk! The toes were even starting to disappear! If machines do all the manual labor, nothing will be left for us to do but engage in shallow conversation over a television-like screen while  eating liquid fast food!What brilliant satire! The message is clear! People need to get outdoors more often and enjoy life. Get off the computer, shut off the T.V. and leave your Cell Phone in the glove compartment! Don't let technology rule your life or make you sick!But I save the best to last! Wall-E is first, and foremost, a cautionary tale about wrecking the environment. Through the eyes of an adult,  I found this film to be profoundly sobering.  In Wall-E's world the Consumer Culture  has literally consumed the planet making it uninhabitable. People were so focused on a throw-away economy and vapid entertainment, eventually nothing was left  except one sentient  maintenance robot struggling to find a purpose. The stupidity and ugliness  of the human race is juxtaposed by the beauty of Wall-E's determination to enjoy his existence.What an amazing and poignant story! My hats off to Pixar for attempting to warn us about sustainable living and protecting the environment in the process!If I could recommend one book, which I actually finished the day before I saw Wall-E it's:The World Without Us.  I consider this book to be one of  the best non-fiction books I have read in my entire life. I can't recommend it highly enough!For other great Science Fiction see:ZardozandEnemy MineandFantastic PlanetandA.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)andBicentennial ManandGalaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)"	5.0	What A Profound Cautionary Tale!	2008-06-30	15	10	5

Thankfully, Pixar's amazing animation, combined with good storylines and endearing characters, have put that fear to rest.""Wall-E"", Disney/Pixar's latest offering is a charming tale of a little garbage-compacting robot left on Earth after its inhabitants escape the planet's damaged environment, poisoned by years of pollution and excessive refuse.  Wall-E goes about his daily routine, condensing trash and collecting little artifacts that amuse him.  His one companion is a cockroach (because we all know they can survive anything!) but he yearns for a friend and partner.  When a huge ship arrives and leaves a sleek and fetching robot, whom we later learn is named Eve, Wall-E is blinded by love.When Eve completes her mission on Earth and leaves, Wall-E becomes a stowaway and travels to the AXIOM, the ship holding the escaped citizens of Earth.  After hundreds of years of being coddled and pampered by robots for all their needs, humanity has become overweight, mindless and helpless.  Wall-E and Eve, with a group of misfit robots, are determined to return the people to their home planet, which again shows the capacity for nuturing and sustaining life.Disney has managed to make a touching and comical tale that will appeal instantly to people of all ages.  Adults will love the sophisticated humor as well as the movie references peppered throughout the film and kids will enjoy Wall-e's clumsy and humorous ways.  While some people may worry about the lack of dialogue, I believe they will find that this enchanting little fella will steal their hearts with only a handful of words.  Wall-E's expressions easily convey his emotions and are bound to tug at your heartstrings.  The movie also offers good messages about love and friendship as well as the danger of over polluting our home, a message that can't be stressed enough.  And, as usual, the animation is beautiful and captivating.""Wall-E"" is bound to become one of Disney/Pixar's classic animated films.  This little gem is a treat for the entire family.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A8S11VP9Z36D6	"Dave ""Davelandweb"""	"I cannot rave enough about this movie. The trailers (in my opinion) did a poor job of giving an idea of what this movie is about. It is a love story as well as being a statement on our lazy society, with a not-so-subtle but very intelligently delivered message: we are running out of time. Be responsible! It may sound heavy, but trust me...this is a total gem to watch. Only Disney/Pixar could make a little animated robot like Wall-E so loveable. Wall-E is a robot who has been left on earth to try to clean up the polluted mess that the humans left there before escaping aboard what basically resembles a space-cruise ship. Another robot, Eve, comes to earth and finds a plant on Earth, signalling that the planet might be able to sustain life again. When the ""higher-ups"" try to squelch that information, it's up to Wall-E & Eve to get the word out, otherwise the humans are doomed to be overweight blobs for the rest of their lives. Honestly, I do sympathize with Pixar for their poor trailers; Wall-E is difficult to put into words. Just watch it! The characterizations is truly amazing. Voice talent includes Sigourney Weaver, Fred Willard, John Ratzenberger, and Kathy Najimy.""Wall-E"" is a direct-to-digital transfer presented in 1080p/AVC MPEG-4 video at 2.35:1 on the Blu-ray edition. On the 3-disc special editions, there are two discs packed full of extras and a third with a Digital Copy. All video materials are presented in full 1080 video (on the Blu-ray version), and subtitle options are offered in English on the video-based materials.Disc One:Audio Commentary - The standard DVD edition of 'Wall-E' includes an audio commentary with director Andrew Stanton. That commentary is presented here in a Cine-Explore mode that also includes picture-in-picture visual information with an option to switch off the visuals and listen to the audio-only portion. The commentary with Stanton is the same for the DVD and Blu-ray versions.Short Pixar Film: ""Burn-E"" (HD, 7 minutes) - About a little robot (Burn-E) who tries to replace a light on the outside of a spaceship. Intercut with scenes from Wall-E, Burn-E is just as adorable as Eve & Wall-E. The short is also viewable in a PIP mode that includes running storyboards for the entire short. Great for behind-the-scenes geeks.Short Film (HD, 5 minutes) - This Pixar short called ""Presto"" was shown with Wall-E when it was released. I really enjoyed this tale of a magician whose rabbit revolts when he won't feed him a carrot. The animation is spectacular, and so is the story. I hope to see more of this comic due. The rabbit definitely has shades of Bugs Bunny, but with a little more heart.Theatrical Trailers (HD) - Including 'Pinocchio,' 'The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,' 'Earth' and 'Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure,' as well as a 'Disney Parks' promo spot.Disc Two:The extras on disc two are divided into two sections, first ""Robots,"" then ""Humans."" All materials are in full 1080 HD, with English, French and Spanish Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo and subtitle options.Deleted Scenes (HD, 22:54 minutes) - Featured in the ""Humans"" section, you get four scenes here, playable individually or as a group (with introduction by Andrew Stanton). The four scenes are: ""Garbage Airlock,"" ""Dumper,"" ""Secret Files,"" and ""Docking."" They vary in their degree of being ""finished"" (some made it to the completely animated stage, some just have rough concept art). The scenes are enjoyable, but after hearing Stanton's explanations, it is obvious that the right choices were made. Interesting to hear Stanton say that very few extraneous scenes actually make it to the fully animated stage.""Behind-the-Scenes"" Featurettes (HD, 1:09:45 minutes) - These documentaries give us a fairly thorough visual overview of the conception and production of 'Wall-E.' Interviews with Stanton and most of the Pixar crew are intercut with extensive making-of footage shot during the story development, animation, and post-production processes. ""The Imperfect Lens: Creating the Look of Wall-E"" (14:32) covers the beginning stages of visual design. ""Animation Sound Design: Building Worlds from the Sound Up"" (18:43) dissects the creation of the film's entire soundtrack, which was constructed completely in the studio. ""Captain's Log: The Evolution of Humans"" (7:57) goes in-depth into the conceptualization and rendering of the film's human characters. ""Notes on a Score"" (10:39) discusses Wall-E's music. ""Wall-E and Eve"" (7:00) is an excellent look at how the Pixar team gave depth and humanity to Wall-E and Eve. They apparently imagined the two as if they were Buster Keanton and Sigourney Weaver!BnL Shorts (HD, 8:45 minutes) - Full-length versions of the three short films watched by Wall-E in the movie are presented here uncut and fully-animated. The three shorts are: ""Captaining the Axiom,"" ""Operation Cleanup"" and ""Meet the BnL Bots."". With some narration by Fred Willard, it is obvious that these are made in a sarcastic tone, but still, they are somewhat depressing seeing how slothful and lazy the humans have become at this stage. Funny, yet very cautionary. ""BnL"" stands for ""Buy n' Large"" (with the aprostrophe after ""n"" eventually being dropped).Gallery (HD) - These extensive still galleries are divided into four sections: ""Character Design,"" ""Layouts & Backgrounds,"" ""Visual Development"" and ""Publicity."" There are over 100 images, including both conceptual art and more fully-rendered drawings. (Note there is also a ""Play All"" function that will automatically advance you through all the stills in the gallery.)Documentary: ""The Pixar Story"" (HD, 1:28:30) - Directed by Academy Award-winning filmmaker Leslie Iwerks, this is a fantastic documentary on the history of Pixar Studios, narrated by Stacy Keach. The entire birth and growth of the copmany is chronicled, from their beginnings in 1979, through early experimental shorts and commercials, to the juggernaut we know now today. Fresh interviews are included with all of Pixar's chief artists, as well as such luminaries as Roy Disney, Tom Hanks and Steve Jobs.Vignette: ""Wall-E's Treasures & Trinkets"" (HD, 4:54) - The ""Robots"" section begins with this montage of Wall-E doing cute little things.Sneak Peek : ""Wall-E's Tour of the Universe"" (HD, 1 minute) - This mock preview spot is a cute promo for the [...] website.""Lots of Bots"" Storybook (HD) - Games, puzzles, narrated by John Ratzenberger and Kathy Najimy.Bot Files (HD 9:04) - A gallery of 28 different robots seen in the film. Each robot gets a 360-degree visual spin with a narrator filling us in on some interesting facts about the machine. Includes Wall-A!Worldwide Trailers (HD 13:37) - Three domestic, and one French-Canadian promo.Disc Three:Digital Copy - A DisneyFile (aka Digital Copy) version of the film in 480p standard-definition. The DisneyFile copy is compatible with PCs, PSP and iTunes.Blu-ray Bonus Content:Cine-Explore Mode - Director Andrew Stanton's solo audio commentary is presented here with additional picture-in-picture information. Stanton jumps right in and immediately tackles the more controversial environmental and political criticisms of the film. He covers his original ideas for the core story, the development of the Wall-E and supporting robot characters, and some of the substantial changes made to the second and third acts as the production progressed. PIP information features a wide range of material, including storyboards, enlargements of small visual details seen in the film, and filmmaker photos and data. Even in audio-only form (there is an option to turn off the PIP portion) this is a great commentary.Geek Talk, Trash Talk & Trivia (HD) - A second visual commentary is offered with a quartet of 'Wall-E' filmmakers: Character team supervisor Bill Wise, co-producer Lindsay Wallace, story artist Derek Thompson and lead animator and story consultant Angus McClain. The four participants are seen via silhouette on the bottom right of the screen (as if you are watching the movie in a theater with them). This is a boisterous, even goofy track, with the four riffing off all sorts of pop culture references and insider stories on what's appearing on-screen. It's perhaps not as articulate and insightful in terms of story and character as Stanton's track, as the group largely comments on visual gags, animation secrets and other technical tidbits.3-D Set Fly-Throughs (HD, 10:38) - Found on disc two (under the ""Humans"" section), click this feature and an interactive map of the Axiom spaceship appears. There are various points of the ship you can click on to watch a full 3-D ""fly-through"" animated tour of the location. The detail is amazing.

Watching how he sets certain items aside, and then later uses them for his own purposes, we begin to get a sense that Wall-E has a level of freedom and personality that is not traditionally associated with robots.  He does not have much to say, however, until he meets another creature, somewhat like himself, the beautiful and frightening Eve.  Eve has come from the stars to pursue her own vocation: searching for life on the devastated planet.  Sleek and polished as she is, Wall-E falls for her immediately, even though she has no interest in a creature as insignificant as he.  Wall-E's longing to be with his beloved Eve drives the rest of film through an exciting adventure that impacts the future of the entire planet and even the degenerate human race.The animation is just breathtaking during the opening sequences, levels off a bit as the story leaves the planet and goes on board ship, but still maintains a very high quality throughout. The story - as much a love story as a science-fiction/fantasy - is sweet, funny, and emotionally engaging for both kids and adults alike, and featuring graphics this impressive, Wall-E is well worth getting to know.  Superb."	5.0	Pixar's science-fiction love story is a genuine masterpiece	2010-02-12	3	2	1

This movie is just fantastic in that regard; I often had to remind myself that nothing you see on-screen is real in a physical sense. That said, I can't quite give WALL-E five stars because most of the time it's all style with little or no substance. The second half contains some entertaining riffs on ""2001,"" but for long stretches there's just a lot of frenetic action for action's sake.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AVPQQOSQ8G5HB	David Yu	!!!!!!! A MUST HAVE FOR TRUE VIDEO/AUDIO-philes !!!!!!!!!I purchased the Wall-E(Two-Disc & BD Live) Blu-Ray version. It works Perfect! Offers Full 1080p quality and 7.1 DTS-MA(Master Audio). I noticed that many people had problems with defective disc and suffered scratched discs due to poor packaging with the Wall-E (3 Disc) Special Editions, so BEWARE!! But the Wall-E (Two-Disc) Blu-Ray version works perfectly fine and I have yet seen any issues.I bought WALL-E, for the sole purpose, to see the full potential of what my theater gear can do. I recently completed my theater system with the purchase of my NEW Vizio 55' LED, 3D, 480 HZ LCD screen (MSRP $2,099). WALL-E showed me what 480 HZ can achieve. WALL-E will show you what Blu-Ray is all about, everything in Wall-E literally look 3D even without using any 3D glasses or filters. There's no presence of grain or artifacts through out the movie, the picture quality is epic and I will use Wall-E as the new standard to test High-Performance HD televisions.The audio is superb. I'm using a Yamaha AVENTAGE RX-A3000 (MSRP $1,899) 7.1 system. All connections are via HDMI 1.4a, which supports the optimal signals for best picture and sound and 3D if available. My A/V confirms that Wall-E (Two-Disc)Blu-Ray version plays pure DTS-Master Audio up 7.1 channels, where some people had problems with the Wall-E-Special Edition (3 disc) only offers the compressed 5.1 DOLBY TrueHD signal on Blu-Ray.Wall-E is the benchmark for Pixar, the actual movie is great and offers a unique experience.Kung-Fu Panda is another CGI flick that is PERFECT to test out your equipment. The frame rates are amazing, esp. on the slow-mo scenes.	5.0	A Review on PICTURE & AUDIO PERFORMANCE, Not a critique of the actual movie ( in terms of plot,moral,storyline,ect.)	2011-04-15	1	1	0

This is a fun-filled movie the entire family will enjoy sitting down and watch.You have all the elements lonely guy[come on folks] who meets a gal and falls in love. We all saw the movie and know what it's about and here we have two characters who share the same quality feelings for one another as we humans do and have fun watching Wall-E try and hold Eva's hand [for a lack of a better word] throughout the movie as seen on his favorite video tape.The one thing I couldn't figure out or didn't understand is that here we have Earth with a massove garbage problem and didn't know what to do with but could make spaceships to take all of mankind into space. What...they didn't know how to make recycleing plants like we have today.So they go into space to pollute it but thats another subject.If there's a video you need in your collection it's this one, romance, comedy and laughter throughout the movie.I've seen the movie over a dozen times and it never gets old just more loveable.	5.0	Love Story for the Decade	2008-08-26	21	13	8

We need more like this!"" Thanks to John Lasseter and the rest at Pixar, we get a quality animated family film almost every year! Even at their worst, Pixar puts out more quality than other studios. And now the give us Wall-E. A story about a lovable little robot, left behind and forgotten about, who is just doing his job and getting through. His life gets exciting when Eve, a recon robot looking for life on Earth, shows up. A friendship ensues and adventure follows when Wall-E follows Eve back to a spaceship carrying what remains of the human race.The human race has now become completely dependent on machines and robots for everything. When Wall-E, Eve and a sign of life on Earth show up, everything goes crazy!This movie is sweet, emotional, funny and very smart. Not only does it make you care for a robot who barely says 5 words the whole movie, but it also has makes a commentary on both environmental issues and how we are growing more dependent on technology without being preachy.

Considering the price we paid (less than $10 total) versus the price for some other Disney movies, this was also a cost-effective purchase.

Of course the little robot Wall-e has to come and save the day. There are a few punchlines and physical comedy as with the previous Pixar movies, but not as many. There is not a lot of ""dialogue"", so to speak, at the beginning, because Wall-e is the only halfway ""living"" thing left on earth.

The image quality is phenomenal, and it absolutely pays off in letting you notice the incredible details that Pixar put into this film. The additional content is also terrific. The Director's commentary includes thumbnails of the early artwork in the film's development. While the Director's commentary gives you the broad backstory and ideas behind the film, there's also a second commentary track, done Mystery Theater 3000 style, that points out all sorts of details and easter eggs in the movie that I'd missed.

None, IMO.  I find this to be a message to humans, as well.  Humans are such CONSUMERS of life, it wouldn't surprise me that we'd end up like that in the future.  This just displayed the message in a more subtle, ironically and funny way.  Let it be known to the uneducated in regards to the history of animation, animation was produced specifically for adults back in the day during the war.  They were shown with the news in the theaters - mostly for comic relief during such a depressing time.  Can't think of a better reason than to turn to animation again due to the recession.  Many animations produced today, as well, are with the adult in mind - think Japanese Animation.  Animation: Not just for kids.That said, it was funny and one of the best Pixar films... although, can't think of any Pixar I dislike.  If you like the short (layman's terms: SHORT cartoon before film), I highly recommend purchasing the Pixar Shorts!  By far my favorite!	5.0	For Little Dialogue, Great Movie	2009-05-19	1	1	0

Other than 1926's Norsteafu and Mel Brook's Silent Movie, I never been a fan of silent movies. However, Wall *E is a different kind of film and with no dialogue; the film paints an amazing picture of devoted love, friendship that easily ranks with P.S. I Love You as one of the best romantic films I've seen in the past six months. While the film isn't really for young kids who grow fidgety this is one of favorite Pixar movies along with The Incredibles and the Toy Story films.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2JCI0BJ3GSB2Z	dfwncl	Not a fan of Disney or Pixar movies, generally, given how they veer off so strongly in the direction of the feel-good, the schmaltzy, and saccharine.  However, I decided to give this one a try, given that it takes on two challenges: &#34;science fiction&#34; and a lack of significant dialogue. So, in my case, three stars would be a high score for a film of this type.  I did, in fact, watch it twice.The film picks up on a tradition of the &#34;robots with feelings&#34; film.  That trope goes back as far as the &#34;robot run amok&#34; trope in American science fiction.  (Now what does that say about us as a society?  That we fear the things we love most?)  And, to give it credit, it does this trope pretty damn well.However, I could not escape the feeling that its apparent critique of consumer society is, well, more than a little unsophisticated or insightful.  So, i do not really understand those who both here and elsewhere are holding it up (or conversely, condemning it) as an &#34;environmentalist film&#34; or a &#34;anti-corporate film.&#34;  I mean, really guys.  If you are praising it for that, you really need to set your standards higher.  And, if you are condemning it on that basis, well, you are just picking low hanging fruit.For my part, I won't be looking to Disney for my moral compass.  Now, moving along...From the point of view of the science fiction genre... Well, it has many of the superficial qualities - enough, to pull the genre fans in and hold him there.  Visually, the cartoonish rendering of the post-apocalyptic landscapes, and the interiors and exteriors of space ships are interesting.  It also has that quality of a technological universe being gradually unfolded in cinematic form.  Props.But, that same cartoonishness on the characters themselves is where it just falls apart.  It becomes almost a parody of itself.  The robots are more Bugs Bunny, Tom and Jerry, and obese Popeye than any futuristic project of &#34;robots.&#34;  And the technological universe it constructs, well, just makes no sense in the end.Sorry Disney/Pixar, you still haven't won me over, even with this one.	3.0	Pixar	2014-06-23	0	0	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2V7OAINYLZD69	"Dhampir ""gamer geek"""	Wall*E was never just a kid's movie. It's got your requisite cute, starring characters and supporting cast, but it's more than that. Much more. This is one of PIXAR's best and brightest stories and visual accomplishments.The story starts with what seems like a simple little robot working to clean up the mess left on Earth. Grabbing garbage, pulling it inside, compacting it into a small cube then stacking it neatly. As the day moves on, you can see this has been going on for a long time. Piles higher than skyscrapers line the streets, each with neatly stacked cubes of trash.Wall*E is really the only thing you see moving around doing anything; his companion is a happy little roach, cheerfully watching and following Wall*E around. Every so often Wall*E finds something and puts it to the side. When he goes home to his storage trailer, he does things that any of us would do: taking off his 'shoes', turning on the lights and turning on his 'TV', a video iPod with magnifying screen.Soon, you can see why he's left alone: all the others units have stopped working. You can get a real sense that Wall*E is the only thing left. And all he wants is someone to be with, just like in the movie he watches and listens to while working, someone to hold hands with. A really cute and endearing theme that stays through the movie.Soon, the arrival of EVE, a slick, hovering robot with a mission arrives. Wall*E soon is fascinated by EVE and they eventually begin to find each other as friends. When Wall*E gives EVE a present he'd found earlier, it triggers her main directive and original reason to be on Earth. When EVE is forced to leave, Wall*E has to follow her.EVE goes home to the star liner that left Earth long ago. There you see where everyone from Earth went; to a simple life filled with automated everything. This is where the supporting characters find their way into Wall*E and EVE's path, a bunch of misfits and malfunctioning robots, all trying to help EVE and Wall*E fulfill her directive. Here, you also get the first real look at what life without any kind work has done to the human population.EVE's directive pushes the story along to find the main antagonist who's kept the humans on the star liner and plans to keep them there no matter what. From here, the race is on to show both EVE and Wall*E's humanity. EVE wants to do what her directive tells her to, but doesn't want to hurt Wall*E. Wall*E just wants to be with EVE and help her any way he can.The whole time I watched this movie, I'm rooting for Wall*E to just keep working his way along, getting a simple pleasure of out watching him do what he does: collect things, spending time with his pet and even dance. Then when EVE shows up, it's like watching the awkward boy try and meet the popular girl. You want them to be together because he deserves it, it's all he wants anymore and helping her makes him happy.I'll also admit I choked up a few times when some events happened. The characters had hooked me pretty hard. I didn't want bad things to happen to Wall*E; I didn't like it when they did. The way the story is made, you feel for Wall*E. They did well in getting the characters just right so that you can and should connect with them earlier and often.Once you start to really look at Wall*E and the rest of the robotic crew, I stopped thinking of them as animated cartoons and as real as any regular movie. The animators were so detailed many times I couldn't think of what I was watching as anything but real. For example, there's many shots of Wall*E's three fingered hands. Taking a close look you can see the weathered, scraped, dinged and scratched fingers of someone who's put in a lot of hard work. Then you look at EVE's smooth, almost silky white fingers and you could almost reach out and touch them both.All in all, I'd recommend this movie for anyone for anytime they want an excellent story with great characters.Of the added extras, the best one was the PIXAR short: Presto. Simple and short and full of comedy. It's the story of a magician with two real magic hats. The first is the top hat, the second is a magician's conical hat. The magician has one assistant, Alec, a hungry bunny. All he wants is his carrot. Without the carrot, he uses the hat combo to keep the magician from simply pulling a rabbit from his hat. The entire time, Alec uses everything around to humiliate (in true comic form) the magician while on stage to the roars of laughter from the crowd.	5.0	Never just a kid's movie	2008-11-23	4	4	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AV1MDPRTESKTB	Diana	"Visually stunning but the movie consists of endless boring chase scenes between the robots. The scenes of Wall-e and EVA being chased on the spaceship makeup for half the movie time. Wall-e is cute and there is an important message about saving earth and plant life- but that cute robot and message were copied from the science fiction classic ""Silent Running"" . Even the design of Wall-e was ripped of from that movie. Disney added binoculars for eyes, but its the same robot design. Too many concepts and scenes just drag on in this film. The floor mopping robot for example, is shown over and over again without adding anything to the film."	1.0	Boring movie. Copycat of Silent Running.	2013-01-01	8	1	7

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3CN9CCJUNIPKT	DJ Joe Sixpack	"""Wall-E,"" which is one of Pixar's last films for Disney, is an absolute masterpiece -- a heartwarming, lively, funny film with a deadly serious message about the dangers of unconstrained mass consumerism, and a glimmer for hope on what may be a dying planet. You probably know the basic outlines of the plot -- Wall-E is the last of a series of small robot trash compactors. left behind to clean up Earth as the frightened remnants of the human race flee into space, to avoid the fallout from their mindless trashing of the planet. Almost by accident he catches up with the humans and finds them flabby and apathetic, each one permanently plugged into their personal entertainment/life management device, and utterly unaware of anything happening in the physical world.What Wall-E discovers, though, is that once the people become unplugged -- or are reached out to in any meaningful way -- their humanity and compassionate spirit emerges with surprising strength.  Left empty by a consumer culture that makes everything ""easy,"" the humans are ready for real-life experience and real-life connections, and are unafraid to make sacrifices to live, rather than simply exist.  The skill with which the Pixar folks tell this story -- and tell it in a way that is not noxious or saccharine -- is astounding.  These artists are at the peak of their form, and seem headed for even better things to come.As far as the reviews, etc., that found this film too bleak, or perhaps unsuitable for younger viewers, I'd say it's certainly worth a preliminary viewing by concerned parents, but it's not really as depressing or dark as early critics made out. It's certainly not as stressful a film as, say, ""Finding Nemo,"" which I do *not* find appropriate for really young viewers. It's worth previewing -- you won't regret seeing it one more time, and it will prepare you for any discussions you might want to have about with your kids about the environmental and social themes of the film. All in all, this is a highly entertaining movie with a substantive message, but it's not preachy or depressing. You'll love it.. your kids will, too.

It's amazing to me what simple things the robots would do to give them character. There are several themes in the movie which are serious, the future of the earth with all the garbage we produce and people caring for other people and wanting to have someone to love. The supplemental material was also very entertaining. I don't often watch them but with Wall E I did. It is also presented in HD. The quality of the video and audio matched the movie.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A11C43I615R52G	"Don Vito Corleone ""The Joker"""	"Wall-E is a movie that has an unlikely story but it pulls it off in a marvelous way. Pixar's ninth film is another triumph for the studio because it deftly bends comedy, action, emotion and awe-inspiring animation that should take everyone's breath away. This is a film that has very few words (especially in the first part of it) but the characters are very well rounded despite their ability to say very few words. It's impossible not to root for Wall-E, he is a character that has a sunny disposition despite being all alone and when EVE arrives, he'll do anything to be with her. This movie has a lot of messages but fortunately, they are not pushed down your throat. Wall-E despite many environmental undertones, it's a love story. And is a wonderful one.The animation in Wall-E is as usual for Pixar, simply outstanding. You will stare in awe as the realistic look of the space, the Earth and many other settings. The comedic timing is impeccable and is remiscent of old silent films from the 1920's. The emotion feels honest and the cast of characters is spectacular. Round this with an amazing score from Thomas Newman and you get a masterpiece.Video & AudioWall-E in Bd looks absolutely amazing. This is not surprise as all the other Pixar films looks spectacular on HD. You will see every detail, every texture. Detail is sharp and colors are well reproduced. A magnificent transafer.The 5.1 DTS-HD MA is also outstanding. There is directionality in every way and every sound is perfectly clear without any type of distortion.Bonus Features:This is a loaded 2-disc BD set with phenomenal bonus material. On disc 1 you have cine-explore which is a commentary with director Andrew Stanton. Also you have two great shorts - Presto and Burn-E. On disc two you have a lot of featurettes that delves with the creation of the film such as story, characters, sound design among others. Also you have publicity material and galleries. But thehighlight of the disc is without any doubt the amazing documentary ""The Pixar Story"" directed by Leslie Iwerks that delves with how Pixar was founded and came to be the most succesful animation company in the world. Is an insightful and fun documentary that no one should miss. The documentary goes from the very beginning of Pixar when it was a Lucasfilm division until the release of Cars in 2006. I hope they do a follow up covering the rest of the films (from Ratatouille onwards). You also have some games and othe material.The amount of bonus content is amazing making this one of the best BD sets ever.A DVD copy of the film is also included.Closing thoughts:Wall-E is an instant classic film that proves that Pixar can do no wrong. Bending comedy, action and honest emotion with a cast of great characters and wonderful music, this movie is a must own for everyone. Disney has put an spectacular package with truly amazing video & aundio and oustading bonus material, this is a set that everyone should buy. Very Highly Recommended!!!"	5.0	A Pixar triumph that shines on BD!!!	2011-07-28	3	2	1
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2WCQLJFTE23OG	Doug Bowker	"Wall-E may just be Pixar's absolute best movie to date, although also by far most subtle. If you go looking for Shrek, or Looney Toones, or other hyper-active cartoons you probably won't get it. No dialogue for much of the first section, vast, bleached out landscapes, no story laid out in the first five minutes. All of what it makes it more difficult at first serves to make it that much better! And repeated viewings only make it more amazing and fun. But don't let anyone make you think it's not absoloutely FUN, and funny, because it's great from start to finish. I took my two-and-a-half year old son to it this last summer in the theater and he LOVED every minute, including the very creatively done end credits. Since then he has loved watching the Blu-ray DVD we got and gets the big messages (take care of the Earth, help each other, work together) and of course loves the sheer visual spectacle. He loves Wall-E and Eve and enjoys all of the funny things the story sets up for them. We also have the excellent sound track which we all enjoy- a great Peter Gabriel track plays in the credits and it's one of his better songs in recent years.I'm not go to give a plot synopsis since Amazon does a good job of that already. As back ground, let me say first that I own all the Pixar movies, including the shorts, and most of the ""making of"" books, so you can safely say I am a big fan and educated viewer of their work. I also am a professional animator (not films but technical/educational work), but I love their films from the ""kid inside"" first, and the adult second. And that's what makes them so good- to paraphrase John Lasseter- ""before and after all the sights, sounds and wonder of it all- do you care about the characters?"" That's what makes them different than any other animation studio. They use very little irony or pop culture references, and often skip using big name actors to push their marketing (Wall-E has almost no big ""stars"" to drive it). They make stories of wonder that have characters (whether it's a fish, a one-eyed monster, a race car or a cowboy toy) that you truly love and care about. Wall-e is no different.From the beginning you like this little guy who works tirelessly to clean up a mess his makers left behind, and by the end you love him for wanting more than anything to connect to others and find the love he longs for. Along the way he teaches both humans and other robots that sometimes you need to defy your programming and reach out beyond what is safe to really be alive. As the captain says in an argument with the controlling Auto (Otto) pilot: ""I don't want to SURVIVE, I want LIVE!""Visually, it's a tour de force whether on the Earth section or the space section. The environments, although somewhat fanciful and stylalized, are incredibly detailed and realistic. Every time I watch it more things come out and their is more to see in the story.Personally, I have yet to watch it with anyone who has not liked this movie- grandparents, sitters, my wife, etc. As an adult, more of the larger implications will come through obviously. But the heart of the movie is simple: take care of beauty, reach out to others, what's of value can't be bought, only shared."	5.0	The Little Robot that brought Humanity Down to Earth	2008-12-07	7	5	2

'Wall E' is nothing short of incredible and Pixar steps outside its ""kiddies movie"" boundaries with this smart and endearing Sci-Fi love story! This film was a huge gamble and having so little dialogue could have been a disaster, but while the film is short on words, it does not suffer from having nothing to say! It's amazing how much is said without the use of ""words"" in this beautiful and poignant film of a lonely robot who goes about his directive until he first lays eyes on EVE ( Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) another Robot sent to check for sustainable life on the planet. It is not until that moment does he begin to realize just how lonely he is. Up until now he has been content to clean the area and collect the many items that catch his fancy along with his only company and companion his pet cockroach.Not since R2 D2 stole the show in Star Wars 'A New Hope' has a little robot had so much character and charm. Wall E (Waste Allocated Load Lifter) says little, but his feelings are so well conveyed you won't miss one heartbeat! The interaction between these two is beautifully handled and the film is full of intelligent humor and pathos with a heartfelt romance all wrapped up in a gorgeous looking Sci-Fi epic. Besides having many memorable characters, the animation is truly breathtaking and at times it is hard not to believe this is live action. The story may be a little too deep a satire for small children to truly understand, but they will fall in love with the characters regardless.This could be the greatest Sci-Fi/Romance films ever made bar none! It's a monumental achievement on every level and Pixar should be very proud of this living breathing animated film.  It's absolutely fantastic the way the film unfolds as this little robot goes about his duties and routines and then being lovestruck and hopelessly in love with EVE from the moment he sees her. WALL E realizes true loneliness for the first time. EVE the object of his affection is also a fully realized character and the interaction between the two is genuine and heartfelt.The second part of the story deals with WALL E losing his soulmate and doing what he must to be with her. From Earth to Spaceship and so the plot thickens. Human Life only exist on this ever cruising spaceship which is basically a huge cruise ship. We meet some delightful characters aboard this vessel. M-O Microbe Obliterator is a stand out as a tenacious little robot who will stop at nothing to rid the Spaceship of "" foreign Contaminant.  Auto is sort of a villain but robots only do what they are programed to do. The messages run deep in this film, but it balances them with such a wonderful feel good story that it never fells heavy handed or preachy. I've watched this film maybe a dozen times and it seems to improve with each viewing.  Wall E is nothing short of spectacular and it should have won Academy Awards across the board.The Blu Ray release is flawless and all bonus features have been ported over. It's a breathtaking looking film in Blu Ray with sound to match and should be in any animation collector's collection if not any great film collection."	5.0	PIXAR'S MASTERPIECE GETS A FANTASTIC BLU RAY RELEASE!

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3MFOSSEZRKQBY	D. Tyce	Wall E starts out fine but in the second half a message that is dangerous and just wrong comes across.  The message is that fat people are lazy and stupid.  Every human character in this movie is grossly obese and lazy.  They stay in recliner chairs that hover and move around so they don't have to.  They are so lazy, they don't even eat their food, they drink it instead.  Then they are portrayed as dumber than dirt when their captain tells them they can grow pizza plants on earth.  They are so excited to grow pizza plants, they wobble and waddle out of their chairs to follow the captain.  It is sickening and untrue.  If Pixar or Disney showed a race of people the way they show fat people the movie would be banned.	1.0	Terrible message in movie	2008-08-13	163	19	144
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AIA1X0R7JEIA8	Duane Browning	"This film is perfect for all ages, but it does have some parts that might be emotionally troubling for children due to the seriousness of the scene, such as when Wall-E is badly injured.While watching this film, my emotions ranged from laughing to crying and I was awestruck by the detail of the scenes. You can tell that the production quality was a high priority when ""Wall-E"" was in development. Even though there isn't much in the way of dialogue from any of the robots, what was said seemed appropriate and well-scripted.Wall-E has the curiosity and playfulness of a child, yet was also quite lonely which explains his quick fascination with Eve. His antics while trying to win her heart reminded me of my own youth as I stumbled-around trying to win the affections of whatever girl I was interested in at the time. I wasn't as bad-off as Wall-E, but I have to admit that I was rooting for him.""Wall-E"" is an absolutely beautiful movie which I have already watched several times since renting it yesterday and I will be buying my digital copy in the future."	5.0	A Beautiful Movie	2012-04-22	1	1	0

Another animated feature film for the kiddies, a ton of good reviews, ho-hum.  Well, this past weekend, I decided to check Rottentomatoes, a movie website that tallies the average of over a hundred critical reviews and gives a percentage: Iron Man got a 93% (excellent!).  Wall-E got 97%!  Ok, so maybe I should see it.  I went with my brother, and sat in a crowded theater with more  kids than adults.  Wow, was I blown away!  Yes, the visual effects and animation were state of the art, but we've come to expect that.  What I couldn't foresee was how human the animated robotic protagonists were, and how well-told the story is.  The litmus test of a great children's movie seems to be that it is very appealing to adults, that adults leave the theater, drive home, and talk about it with their friends and family.  This movie is one grown-ups will love, quite possibly the first children's animated movie that adults will admire even more than their kids.  It is THAT good!  And the romance between the two lovable robots will set a standard that most live action movies with a romantic theme wish they can achieve.This is a great environmental movie too, one that Al Gore ""An Inconvenient Truth"" doesn't come close to matching.  Imagine this, a children's animated movie that's truly hilarious, sad, thoughtful and heartbreaking, mature, romantic, and with a social conscience that doesn't pander.  One of the best movies I've ever seen.  Five stars isn't enough for a film that brought tears to the eyes of a few full-grown men (mine included, ok, I admit it!)  You must see this film in a crowded theater, and watch for the applause at the end from the audience."	5.0	One of the best films of the year yet	2008-06-29	16	11	5

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2PLMMVM7J0128	Ehkzu	"Regarding most of the 391 reviews written before this one, mostly I'd say ""what they said."" I just wanted to stress that the second part involving humans is good too--particularly the way the captain grows a backbone. That was an unexpected revelation, since by that point the viewer has become so focused on WALL-E and EVE.My only criticism stems from the fact that we saw ""Bolt"" in 3D the day after seeing WALL-E at home on our big screen (fortunately we have a 120Hz refresh rate LCD TV so it was able to keep up with the action). Anyway, ""Bolt""'s 3D animation sets a new standard of naturalness, and I doubt it can be retrofitted to existing films. So ""WALL-E"" may come to be known the way the last of the great silent films were known just before the introduction of talkies. Or the way the last of the great black & white films were know before color became common and high quality back in the 50s.Yes, ""Bolt""'s 3D is that good.Apart from that my recommendation is that if you haven't seen WALL-E yet and don't know every turn of the plot, at the very least you know by now that this is one of the best films of the year, both for kids and adults. So try to see it as ""virginally"" as you can. Read the reviews after you've seen the film, since so many are full of spoilers.One more thing--this is one of those films where stuff happens during the end credits. So keep watching until the very very end. You'll be glad you did."	5.0	The second part is good too!	2008-12-30	1	1	0

Huinda	"For those of us parents who were expecting a movie as thoroughly enjoyable as Toy Story or Monsters Inc., which was highly entertaining for both the parents AND their preschool-aged children, this was a HUGE disappointment. None of us--my husband, I, and our children--enjoyed the movie. Having 3 little boys, I was excited by the prospect of a movie about robots made by Pixar. What better combination, I thought. Unfortunately, the movie is not about Wall-E or his story. It's about staring at the earth filled with mountains of garbage and watching a nearly personality-less robot make these mountains of garbage for extremely long periods of time. Since when have I ever sat in a movie theater and thought...""Okay, surely the story is going to start any moment"" only to find out it never does? This is a first! Pixar failed miserably in utilizing a potentially great character to weave a cautionary tale--they wasted Wall-E! Instead of inspiring the spirit to take care of the earth, Pixar has nearly satirized the environmentalist message through the painfully long landscape scenes and lack of plot. The movie belabors the obvious. The robots are uninteresting and barely qualify as characters. Wall-E lacks the humor, excitement, and classic story-telling techniques I have come to expect from Pixar. This movie is certainly outside Pixar's box, and for that reason we were terribly disappointed."	2.0	"Outside of the Pixar ""box"" and a HUGE disappointment"	2008-11-19	27	6	21

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1TOH8S8I1VT9R	"E K Maxmias ""Frighteningly Real"""	"By the vote counter up there, I can tell you all agree with me!!  I'm on a real hot streak now; three films in a row that people are all lathered up about and three films I didn't hate but didn't love either.  Wall-E is the latest film to squander great potential on a few poor decisions.  I need to make this clear newspaper style:SOME OF THIS MIGHT BE CONSIDERED SPOILER:  CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED.-MACHIINES WITH PERSONALITYUnlike the unaffecting characters in ""Robots"", Wall-E robots are full of loveable personality.  They seem to have an innate ability to love and care for things often trivial.  How they recognize what is of value is assumed to be part of whatever AI they have been given.  They also seem to crave physical contact, regardless of their lack or need of tactile sensitivity.  These machines have traits that their contemporary humans have forgotten despite these traits being instinctive to the species.-DOING THE EASY THINGS SPECTACULARLYPixar should get credit for making the first half of Wall-E as realistic as any CG film ever created.  The cityscapes are haunting, the environmental effects palpable, and the machines detailed and gritty.  The virtual lack of dialogue causes the viewer to stay mentally locked to the screen.  Despite the implausible scenario taking place, I was immersed in this film with heart and soul.  Of course, true animation genius is in the depiction of organic life forms-A WORLD OF POP-N-FRESH PEOPLEAt some point in this film, we meet the people out in space.  Inexplicably, they are all Americans, they are all divided into 2 age groups and we don't know how they have survived 700 years without procreating.  That's right folks; out in the depths of space, all of human kind is either a 30 something adult or an 18 month-ish toddler and they are all Americans.  I don't need to tell you about their grotesque, atrophy induced obesity; I'm sure you've heard about it.  As real as everything else looked, the people all look like well animated, pink pop-n-fresh's and my immersion into this film ended.  It seems Pixar has yet to master the most difficult subject matter; people.  Introduction of humanity started to beg questions; since people don't make physical contact anymore (they don't even look at each other), where did the babies come from and where are the old people?  Where are the Africans, Mid-easterns, Asians and Hispanics descendants?  Also, even in space without any natural resources, humans still produce enormous amounts of trash.  Where are the materials and the food coming from? This brought up many disturbing scenarios in my mind; Soylent Green anyone?-CRUSHING SOCIO-POLITICAL MESSAGEDo you go to a Pixar film to be hammered with socio-political commentary?  Do you think it's ok to preach your views in a ""children's film"" regardless of the message?  If you think this film was not heavy handed in its message then you must be compliant with the message and not mind your kids being taught Pixar's views.  The film ""Fern Gully"" made a strong ecological message without blaming anyone specifically or implying it knew what the real consequences were.  Wall-E gets pretty specific about whom to blame; American consumerism, Big Box Stores, Industry, technology culture... ...well, everything perceived wrong with America by Pixar (ironically).  It also gets very specific about what ""will"" happen to the Earth.  I can't say I disagree with all of their views but is this kid's film the proper venue?  They couldn't have been less subtle.-KIDS WON'T GET THIS AND SOME ADULTS WILL IGNORE ITMany people would suggest that I should just enjoy Wall-E as a family film and move on; why get all wrapped up in the message?  Believe me; I did enjoy much of this film.  Artistically it has a lot going for it.  Overall, it's a fairly fun movie.  But, if I should ignore the message, why is it there?  I guess I'm damned for actually thinking about films that I watch.  In the end, the message stood out like an ugly tumor.  It had a clear agenda and was obtrusive in this family film.  I teach my kids to learn by observation, education and to think for themselves. This is what Wall-E is suggesting we do; isn't it?-SIT THROUGH THE END CREDITSArtistically speaking, the end credits are very unique.  It basically wraps up the ridiculously optimistic future of the formerly (not but days before) incapable American Humans.  It depicts them reviving the earth armed with one plant.  I don't know how they gleaned other species of plant life through this one plant, but that's really not the point.  As the credits take us through the new human legacy, the art style progresses from cave painting up to digital, pixilated art (with some nice art periods between).  Some pretty cool Peter Gabriel Music fills the gaps; very nice.-I'M NOT A HATER... ...REALLY!!I recommend you go see Wall-E.  It's a good film though it missed greatness.  When you put strong social statements into a film, you have a responsibility to support your argument.  The story lacks the required details to support the statement, and rightfully so.  In fact, the statement should have been handled in a much less obtrusive manner or not made at all.  Please go see this armed with the knowledge that Pixar is voicing a specific socio-political opinion.  I'm not admonishing the opinion, but rather the forum in which they voiced it.  Apprise your kids that other opinions exist before entering.  Talk about ecological issues.  Talk about humanities loss of intimacy in our society if you like.  Talk about perceptions of the big-box mentality.  I don't care what you talk about, just talk to your kids before Pixar does.  If you don't, you will be guilty of the very complacency Pixar so cleverly admonishes us for in this film.  I don't brainwash my kids and I don't want Pixar doing it either."	4.0	The Socio-political Message; Guilt by Compliance	2008-07-14	12	5	7

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AAG3WH6O2F926	Electro	It seems that Pixar can do no wrong. Again they've produced another masterpiece with the release of Wall-E, which is as lovable, captivating, and entertaining as all of the other Pixar films thus far. In spite of this, however, audiences should not be expecting the usual Pixar style with this movie. The focus is not necessarily on dialogue or humor in Wall-E, but rather takes a new approach which delivers the story at an angle which puts more emphasis on a fascinating series of events, impressive animation, and discovering an innovative way of looking at its characters. With most of the main characters being robots with mannerisms and speech patterns very different from past Pixar characters (such as bugs, humans, toys, or monsters), the movie proceeds in a very different fashion but pulls off the effect flawlessly. Even a few non-animated segments are blended into the film, but setting aside the differences I was still able to enjoy another fantastic movie from Pixar. I connected a lot with the characters of Wall-E and Eve, and very much liked the plot and depictions of the future. From the trailers you can hardly tell what the plot will be, which made me even more interested to see how things folded out. I highly recommend this movie, and rate it five stars. Even though it's not my favorite Pixar movie (I'd say it's better than Cars and Ratatouille at least), it's still a classic and well worth watching.	5.0	Unique for Pixar, Great for Everyone	2008-07-08	6	4	2

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4	Elisabeth	This movie has some good visuals.  And I don't just mean the excellent graphics (I'd expect nothing less from Pixar), but also the imagery of a world where people totally surrender to laziness.There's also some important messages about what happens when you divorce yourself from nature.  I especially liked the scene where the captain becomes completely fascinated seeing a living plant...which is in great contrast to the overly sanitized world he'd been living in.There's also a message about how divorced we've become from other humans.  I especially liked the scene where a man and woman accidentally touch each other and are shocked by the feel of human skin.The character Wall-E is cute (he reminded me of E.T.) and I understand it must've been a challenge for the writers and artists to make a non-talking creature seem interesting.  There's a good effort to try and translate Wall-E's feelings for his robot love interest EVE through body language.  However, it wasn't enough to hold my interest.  I also didn't understand why humans would give working robots feelings and emotions.  What purpose would that serve?And while I appreciated the messages in this movie, it was also served a bit heavy-handedly...but then again, this is a kid's movie so maybe that explains the blatantly obvious nature of the message.My main complaint, though, is that the movie is very slow moving and I found myself getting quite bored, especially since the world Wall-E inhabits is visually uninteresting.When I saw the preview for this movie long ago, I thought this movie would be enjoyable and funny, but instead ended up being rather boring.	2.0	Good message, but too slow in delivering	2010-06-16	6	2	4

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3RU2P4FAACQ1J	"Elton Pinto ""Eptiger"""	"In case you didn't have the good fortune of catching this movie when it was in theaters, it's the story of the last robot left on Earth after the humans fled the planet on a resort spaceship while the planet was being cleaned up by robots like Wall-E that compact trash and incinerate it since we we produced way too much trash for the planet to handle. I don't want to talk too much to the story, particularly because of spoilers (I hate spoiling things, even months after a movie is out), but it's really quite impressive. After watching it again I'm convinced that it's my favorite animated movie of all time. Part of what I love about it is that it doesn't have to compromise by having something for the kids and something for adults to enjoy like a lot of animated movies tend to do, it's just a wonderful experience for everyone. It really is unique, in my opinion, in this way. Even the physical humor really isn't childishly silly, it's clever. I kind of feel like it's a modern-day geek movie on par withTronorReal Genius. Could it be the first one sinceThe Matrix? I think it's the best robot movie ever. Suffice to say, the always stellar folks at Pixar really outdid themselves with this movie. It's fun, beautiful, heart-warming, fascinating, nerdy, and probably much more that I'm forgetting to say here. It's just really one of those rare A+ movies, which is confirmed when 5 months later I'm chomping at the bit to see it again and feel every bit as good about it as I did when I originally saw it.Now let's get into the Blu-ray set here. The visuals are every bit as stunning on Blu-ray as they were in the movie theater. The problem with DVDs was that the quality was always inconsistent between movies. MyStranger Than Fictiondisc looks almost like 1080i, but not myBatman Begins. Not so with Blu-ray, as far as I can tell. The bigger the screen you have at your disposal the more impressed you're likely to be. I was trying to finish up my laundry as I started the movie but I could not pull my eyes away from the movie because of how jaw-dropping the visuals were. And as if that wasn't enough, the audio is equally impressive. My TV only has simulated surround sound, but it felt pretty real to me. It's funny how a movie with so little dialogue can have such powerful audio through its score and robot noises and such. I can't even imagine how incredible this set will be for those with a true Dolby setup at home.I should really step back for a second and remark at how impressed I am by the all around presentation from Disney. They really know how to brand themselves and their intellectual property. The first thing I encountered was BD Live stuff, and so I gladly went to the Disney site to setup my account and had no troubles at all. I'm 99% sure you could go right past all of this, but I just chose not to because I was excited about BD Live. There was only 4 features available, 2 of which I couldn't use. One was movie chat, where you and other friends with the movie can watch the move at the same time while text chatting. Yes, it will synchronize your movies, so I guess this would be good for cousins in different cities or when dad is on a business trip or something. They made the smart move of only allowing this between trusted friends, not just random strangers. Another one is movie mail, in which you can splice together scenes from the movie to make messages to send to trusted friends, and also add in video of yourself (no idea how, maybe through an EyeToy for PS3 owners?). I did use the movie challenge feature though, where you can join in live trivia challenges with strangers online in 10 minute rounds of 8-15 questions. I could choose from easy or medium, and I chose easy. They were fairly simple questions and what I loved was how it would just be at the bottom of the screen while you watch the movie. So you can pause the movie, open this up, and play while resuming playback. It's actually pretty fun and you get points depending on how fast you answer. The last feature is reward points, which is confusing to me but I think you earn them through the trivia and other stuff on the Disney site and you can redeem them for avatars and other bonus features and stuff, but I think that this is still in the process of being fleshed out more.I liked the BD Live features because I felt like they were easy to get to and integrated well, but the other stuff was even better. First of all, there are 3 ways to watch the movie, or two in addition to just watching the normal movie. One is called Cin-experience, where you get insightful director's commentary in addition to picture-in-picture pop-ups of artwork and (silent) videos of animation from the pre-visualization and design stages of the film. I usually never listen to these commentary tracks, but in a movie with as little dialogue as Wall-E, I gave it a shot and loved it. The artwork really does add a surprising amount to the experience, and I learned a lot of cool random things about the movie, like that it took them over 3 years to put it together (it sounds like they started thinking about it in the late 90s). You could also turn off the artwork from the pop-up menu, which is a standard thing with Blu-ray discs. If you watch the movie normally, you can pop-up stuff from the main menu without having to pause the movie, like choosing a scene via screen shot rather than having to do the guesswork of skipping ahead or backwards on your remote. The other way to watch the movie is kind of like Science Mystery Theater where a group of four people who helped with the film and are generally kind of geeky point out random trivia and scientific inconsistencies and such, with a silhouetted couch occasionally popping up. It really was them on the couch, or else they put an undue amount of effort into animating their arms and hands as they talked. It was a really fun spin on a commentary track and I enjoyed the little of it that I tried out (I will watch the whole movie with it eventually). The only gripe I had with these was that you couldn't just turn them off in the middle of the movie. You could fairly easily stop the movie and go back to the main movie to choose the chapter and then resume playing in normal mode, but it should've been an easy on/off switch. Despite that odd pitfall, it really does help show why Blu-ray really is better than DVD.There's more extras than that, and what's more exciting is that they're pretty much all in high-definition, even the promotional ""sneak peeks""! While I appreciate the throwback to the video cassette Disney movies where they start out with ""Coming soon to video"" and all that (they had the same style and everything), I still don't think I like them starting out when you put in the disc the second time. I forgive it because there were a couple of really cool ones that looked gorgeous in HD, including one for the Disney documentary Earth. That's probably going to be in every big box electronics store as a demo once it's out on Blu-ray a year from now. It was simply the most incredible thing I've seen on my TV, including Wall-E. Anyway, there are real extras here, so let me stop teasing you with these psuedo-extras. The Axiom Arcade has 4 8-bit games that look like they would've been on your NES, and I thought that they were nifty, though maybe too advanced for kids not on the tail end of elementary school. There was also an interactive storybook for kids and ""Trinkets and Treasures"", which seems like it was animators playing with Wall-E and Eve to do random things, like Wall-E breaking a vacuum (which was one of the early teasers for the film). For the adults there's a documentary that's over an hour long, 3-D fly throughs of the virtual sets, Buy and Large shorts, a short Geek-o-rama featurette, profiles of all the robots in the film, and deleted scenes (spliced together frames to form a rough cut) with video commentary from the director before and after the scenes. There's also the Presto short from when the movie was in theaters and a short called Burn-E, which is a deleted scene that more or less evolved into a short (there's also an option to view it with story boards). I'm probably leaving something out, but you get the idea: there's a lot here. Not counting the 3 possible viewings of the film, there's well over 2 hours of high-definition content here. Disney probably has no intention of douple dipping with this film because this set is packed with stuff. If you enjoyed the film, I highly recommend picking it up.I went into Blu-ray with plenty of skepticism, but I've been pretty impressed so far, especially with Wall-E.

Also, look for little easter eggs that poke fun at Pixar's link to Apple Computers.Now, as for this DVD prodcut, it's fairly standard.  There are special features, commentary tracks, and so on.  The commentary is much better than I've heard on many DVDs.  Some, like the most recent Simpsons DVD just has the commentary people watching the episode and laughing.  With the Wall-e commentary you get great background info on the thought process of the director.The third DVD with the digital content is not all it's cracked up to be.

One of these days, I'll learn NOT to do that.  Starship Troopers 2 should've been the capper, but sometimes I have to learn the hard way.Wall-E is enigmatic. He is diligent. He is curious. He is easy to love.  My problem with this film is that the story elements are very deep and heavy for smaller children, but moreover, they were wholly awful to watch if you have even half a heart.  I have to say that I failed to derive much enjoyment at all from this film, and what I did, was killed by the horror of the ""message.""People [Americans] too fat to WALK, living aboard a robot-run ship while a single Wall-E unit attempts to clean up the messy planet mankind has left behind.No mention is made of other countries or their populous, but the accents of those aboard the Axiom [a proposition considered to be self-evident] were purely American.And in the end, [SPOILERS] when people return to Earth, it's to the same filth-ridden earth they left 700 years prior, with the same problems, and with a total lack of knowledge of how to survive.

Where else does one find outer space done with such vividity, and such playful cartooniness put on its characters?  It's fantastic.However, what really gets me about this movie is the heart.  Its leading couple may be pieces of metal, but their story is a romance for the ages, one that does not worry about details but only pure and simple love.Some may consider the environmentalism bit a little heavy-handed; I happen to believe that depends on how one feels about environmetalism; I didn't mind it.

The trash compacting robot has one small problem, he's developed a personality.  He is curious and lonely.

EVE is picked up by a pod ship of Axiom and the love stricken Wall-E goes along for the ride.Pixar took a risk in not having much dialogue, in fact there was none until a half hour into the film when we get our first glimpse of humans.  Not having dialogue still made for a funny movie using some inventive humor, but that's not the only funny aspect of this film.  Back to humans, they are pictured as lazy, morbidly obese people who can barely walk.  Not too mention they drift around the Axiom on futuristic looking Laz E Boys.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2D8CUJPOSRPNA	Erik North	"Throughout its history, Walt Disney Studios had always been the leader in animated movies.  Beginning in the mid-1990s, however, its partnership with the digital film company Pixar resulted in a whole new world opening up for the studio--namely that of digital animation.  In the ensuing years, audiences both young and old flocked to see the wide variety of films coming from the Disney/Pixar world: TOY STORY; CARS; FINDING NEMO; and RATATOUILLE, just to name four.  Andrew Stanton, the director of FINDING NEMO, however, had a truly ambitious idea for a new animated film, one which would take Disney/Pixar way into a future in which the existence of Earth and humanity itself rest in the hands of an unlikely hero.  That unlikely hero was WALL-E; and his adventure, when it burst onto the screen in the summer of 2008, resulted in an enormous box office windfall for Disney/Pixar totaling close to $600 million.The titular character of the piece is basically a squat trash compactor, whose name stands for Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth Class.  His job, as has been the case for 700 years, is to clean up the mess that humanity left behind on Earth, compacting various bits of trash into cubes, and whiling away his spare time with a cockroach and a surviving VHS copy of the 1968 film musical HELLO DOLLY.  Wall-E, however, has also gained a sense of conscience and awareness of himself, as can be gauged by his consistently wan expression; and when he sees a small sprout of a plant poking up from underneath an otherwise toxically polluted ground, he senses a change.  He is then visited upon by a female robot called EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), who, upon learning of the existence of the plant in Wall-E's possession, takes both it and Wall-E up to the intergalactic cruise ship Axiom, now in its 700th year of existence, to prove that life on Earth is coming back.Of course, this is all new to Wall-E, as are some fairly disturbing things, like the non-stop consumption of the passengers (fed to them by the same mega-conglomerate, Buy N Large [BNL] that fatally polluted Earth), and their morbid obesity; and the conflict between the ship's captain and the onboard computer named Auto, whose red eye is so much like HAL in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  With Eve's help, however, and after many wacky misadventures, Wall-E helps the captain retake control of the ship, and steer it back towards Earth once the existence of the little plant becomes fact.  In the meantime, Eve and Wall-E begin an electronic love affair that has been building from that first portentous meeting.The swath of digital animation films to come from Disney/Pixar has been nothing short of amazing, but they definitely outdid themselves with WALL-E.  Apart from the genuine likeability of Wall-E himself (as engaging a non-human character as any since E.T.), there are numerous homages to films as varied as the 1972 ecological cult classic SILENT RUNNING, George Lucas' low budget 1971 feature debut THX 1138; the Oscar-winning 2006 documentary AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH; Spielberg's A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and MINORITY REPORT; and even Ridley Scott's 1982 sci-fi/film-noir opus BLADE RUNNER.  And one must also congratulate Stanton for slipping in the homages to ""2001"", with the AUTO/HAL connection and the uses of Richard Strauss' ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" and Johann Strauss' ""The Blue Danube"", even if most children viewing WALL-E likely haven't seen that 1968 Stanley Kubrick sci-fi masterpiece, at least not yet.There are also several ironic comments about human consumption and greed, personified by BNL's CEO Shelby Forthright, amusingly played by Fred Willard, and whose rhetoric of ""stay the course"" is clearly meant as a broadside against George W. Bush.  The message, however, is never delivered in a heavy-handed fashion; and the focus remains on the relationships that Wall-E develops throughout the film, both with his fellow robots, especially Eve, and with the humans onboard the Axiom; and all of this is aided by Thomas Newman's fantastic and futuristic original score.  The end result in WALL-E is one of the most engaging films, animated or otherwise, in recent decades, and a three-pronged success: a typically successful animated comedy; a science fiction voyage; and a reminder of how we can change our planet for the better while there is still time left to do so."	5.0	Meet WALL-E, Mankind's Savior Of The Far Distant Future	2011-04-29	1	1	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M	e. verrillo	"Pixar has made many fine films over the years - all entertaining, all clever, and all heartwarming. But this one stands a cut above the rest - not just for the central character, the undeniably adorable WALL-E, but for the message.WALL-E is a post-apocalypse romance set in the far future. A lone mobile trash compactor (WALL-E),who is all that is left of ""civilization"" (as we know it), falls in love with an Extraterrestrial Vegetation detector (EVE). Yes, it's Adam and Eve, only in robot form. And the Garden of Eden, our beautiful Earth, is a sea of trash. The point couldn't be made more clearly. Humans have finally trashed the planet so badly that it has become an uninhabitable mess, incapable of sustaining life.The point is well taken, and needs to be made. However, where the movie started falling apart for me was when WALL-E follows his sweetheart back to the spaceship that has become home to the fat, pampered survivors of the Earth's demise. There was nothing to suggest that these people were capable of changing the attitudes which had destroyed their home world in the first place. If anything their lives in space had accentuated their wastefulness and complacency. (Just witness the huge amount of trash the ship's inhabitants jettisoned into space.) While it is imperative that a Disney film end on an optimistic note, I couldn't help but feel their return to Earth (We'll grow pizza plants!)was a tragedy. Sad to say, the idea that we can somehow return to Eden with a little well-meaning effort may be just as far-fetched as this lovely Pixar film."	4.0	Pixar comes of age	2009-06-11	3	3	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	ASXTQXYPVW0I6	Extremely Cheesed Off	"I saw this movie in the theatre and LOVED it!  I thought it was brilliant.  I couldn't wait for it to come out on dvd.The day of its release I went to Wal-Mart and purchased the special edition as I really wanted the digital copy for my iPod and computer.  I get home, insert the digital copy into my computer, only to realize there is no authorization code.  I take it back to wal-mart and exchange it.  The lady opens it there and again, no code.  She explains that 10 other people have been in complaining about no codes and how none of the copies seem to have them.  She says I should call disney as they can't be opening every dvd.I get home and get on the phone with Disney ""customer support"".  What it boils down to is they admitted it was their fault.  The girl offers me a sincere apology.  So I figure, great the problem will be rectified.  Nope.  Instead what I am sent via email is a process where by I, the paying customer, must now jump through hoops to get a copy of this code.  I have to print out a form, fill it out, go make copies of my receipt and my proof of purchase and then either scan it, fax it or mail them the forms.  After Disney receives it, they will mail me a code and I should get it in the mail (7-10 business days later).  O_oNow, while it may not seem to be too much hassle to scan and copy and print; there is no reason why I should have to do ANYTHING after I spent my money and Disney clearly admitted fault.  Forgive me if I missed the whole concept of customer service, but shouldn't it be Disney who should be jumping through hoops to rectify the wrong?  I paid extra money to have the product when I purchased it; not to take have to do some legging around and then wait almost 2 weeks later.My advice; if you really want the digital copy buy the regular version for $15 and then hop on iTunes and download Wall-E there.  You'll spend about the same amount of money and you'll save yourself a whole lot of time and aggravation.I hate to give this product a low score as I think this is one of the best movies of all time with a terrific story and great message.  But Disney screwed up big time with their customer service on this one.  Way to not provide for your customers and then treat them like pirating criminals when they want what they should have had at purchase.  It's perplexing.  How can people successfully run a business this way?"	1.0	Great Movie!  Horrible customer support!	2008-11-18	66	37	29
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	ASPC5C2DMGZVP	eyedempotent	Personally I think this was the best Pixar movie ever. It was more than just fun entertainment for both kids and adults, for lack of a better term it's pure art that can influence the average person's life. The way they made you care about a hunk of metal and circuit boards named Wall-E was stunning. I know the ending to Toy Story 3 was touching, but the closest I've come to crying during a movie was near the end of this one. It's just beautiful. It doesn't get any better than the playful scene in space with Wall-E and EVE. I used to not agree with the message but after doing research I have to say they also did a great job of making people think of the consequences of our current path of obesity and using up our natural resources.	5.0	Pixar's finest	2014-02-01	0	0	0

It points out also the problems ever increasing of an over consuming and inactive society relying too much on ""machines"" to do the work...and it shows how this way of living is turning against mankind.Great lessons can be taken from this cartoon; hopefully it will awaken people to go in the right direction....I appreciated the Eco friendly Dvd case; it was somewhat crushed but really it is not a problem the Dvd was perfectly fine and I didn't mind.I do recommend Wall-e as it is entertaining but at the same time educational!"	5.0	More than a cartoon	2013-04-26	0	0	0

I don't want to give any of the story away, just rest assured, if you're in the mood for a fun movie this one has something for kids and adults alike.  My only complaint doesn't have to do with the actual movie at all but the packaging it comes in, on the box it claims to be environmental friendly packaging, but what common sense tells you is that Disney is just being cheap.  It's not your standard dvd case, it's more of a cardboard foldout.  Again, this is a minor complaint, the important part about what you're buying is the actual movie and that's top notch.

Because the poster of the movie gave me no clue of what it is about and I thought it is ""just another animation"". I was wrong, it is ""just not another animation"", it is something I have never seen before (I have seen most of Pixar's animations). The presentation of the story differs from all the computer animations I have seen so far. The movie uses very few dialogues and communicates the story mainly by simple sounds, body language and music. Nevertheless, the story is well told, very interesting and the emotions are well communicated (as least for me). I love the ending too. I am not a professional reviewer but it seems to me that the movie ends on an emotional high instead of rounding up and calming down at the end, quite different from the majority of the animations that I have seen. Again, I am not a professional but it was how I felt.After watching it, I was so amazed that I bought a blu-ray drive so that I can re-watch Wall-E on blu-ray. I then bought this combo and I like it very much, indeed I think the money was very well spent. I think other reviewers have done a great job in explaining its contents too. If I could, I would have given this movie along with this combo a 6 stars rating."	5.0	Amazing package for those who like Wall-E	2012-01-14	2	1	1

"As a guy that prides himself on never crying during a movie, I came darn close during this film. I can't really explain it, but this movie moves you. Maybe it's the universality of it all, the characters, or the humanness of it all, even where humanity seems to be only a shell of itself. Some say it's a story that warns us about our environment, being a kid-friendly version of 'An Inconvenient Truth,"" but it's more than that, because this movie is more about what makes us human.You see, around the year 2103, Fred Willard is the president of a company that's achieved global domination, but this world is quickly on the environmental downturn, so he sends humanity off on a five-year cruise, which as the scope of the problem worsens, quickly becomes 700 years. So around the year 2803, long after many of robots sent to clean the know global garbage dump known as Earth have broken down and gone silent, Wall-E is still diligently doing his job as if he had started yesterday. But even though he stacks haunting skyscrapers of garbage up, Wall-E is inquisitive about his world, picking up the various items that interest him, one of these being an old video tape that managed to survive, which depicts the companionship he longs for. But even with all this underlying sadness, there is hope for all with the arrival of EVE. Make no mistake it, in terms of quality, the first half hour of this movie could be the best EVER in filmmaking. All achieved with very little use of words, letting the emotions speak for themselves.But don't think the rest of the movie is dull, because while different, it certainly is good also. Let me also praise the stunning visuals, which look even better in Blu-Ray, the music, Ben Burtt, and director Andrew Stanton, who is so far the best talent in Hollywood today.Overall, I'm not sure if I'm ready to call this the best animated film of all time, but it certainly is topping my list of best film of 2008, for now. Even with all the hype, Wall-E is an underrated movie for the whole family that provokes thought, and shows us a little of what it means to be human, without being one himself."	5.0	More Than Human, or The Little Robot That Could	2009-02-09	2	2	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2SRHRQ2W2LMZ	Flashman_jp	Wall-e is a very weak movie. The plot is extremely thin, the characters (human or otherwise) are forgettable and, worst of all, it's boring.I can't see why people are calling it the best animated movie of all time. It doesn't work for adults because its plot is so childish and feeble, and it doesn't work for kids because it's just plain average.The proof is in the repeated viewing. My kids will (and indeed have) watch Toy Story, Monsters Inc, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, etc again and again and again. I can happily watch them again and again!They never get bored with those movies and they want a Buzz doll, a cuddly Nemo, the book of Monsters Inc... they just can't get enough.But they watched Wall-e once and maybe a half times more and that was it. No more interest. Back to Buzz and Woody and Sully and Crush.Let's just hope Pixar's next offering is better.	1.0	This is NOT the greatest animated movie... it's boring	2008-11-23	73	16	57

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2897WGLPISHM2	Frank Rhee	"It had to happen someday....a less than perfect Pixar movie. And unfortunately it did happen! Pixar's Wall-E is a good movie. I would even say a great movie. But unlike its predecessors not a ""wow""-movie. Not a ""super""movie. Not an ""it knocked off my socks"" movie. Not a ""boy that was absolutely stunning could I please see that again straight away""-movie. When I walked out of the theatre with my family I was actually surprised to find myself a little bit disappointed. After all, this was the latest Pixar, right ? I so much wanted to like and appreciate this movie like all the others. But the immense measure of satisfaction, joy and elation that had been there all previous times --the ""adrenaline rush""-- was missing this time out. Oh, Wall-E is good and entertaining enough and still of exceptionally high overall quality, but something's missing this time and I don't exactly know what. The magic, I suppose.The Wall-E character is totally endearing but I found it is the only really endearing and interesting character. EVE isn't particularly cute or spectacular. Just an egg with two blue dots for eyes, really. Even when I imagine myself being in Wall-E's shoes (or perhaps I should say on his caterpillar treads), I find it difficult to believe I could fall in love with her, no matter how lonely I would be. In my opinion they could and should have come up with something better. Where previous Pixar movies were an absolute feast of bright colours, eye-catching vistas and exotic shapes and characters, the sets and scenes of Wall-E are mostly dark, drab and devoid of colour. And where there is colour (in the spaceship and the various robots), it is mainly sharp, cold and fluorescent. The animated movie ""Robots"" of a rivaling company, that came out a few years ago, was much more colourful and exiting in this respect.  Wall-E alternates between tediously slow scenes and moments of intense and fast paced action. So fast paced actually that a few times I didn't quite catch what was happening. After half an hour or so the robot bleeps, beeps, pings, pongs, etc. became a little annoying too. I found myself yearning for some spoken dialogue. The plot is a bit simple. That may be OK for smaller kids, but it is too simple for adults. It is in this respect too that Wall-E differs from --for instance-- The Incredibles or Ratatouille. The overall message Pixar wants to convey is OK, but I feel it could have been elaborated more interesting and spectacular. I find that Wall-E as a movie is OK, even great, but definitely not on a par with previous Pixar movies. If you compare it with other animated movies, it still sticks out with head and shoulders above the rest. But unfortunately this is not a common animated movie but a Pixar movie --which is in a league of its own-- so I must compare it with Ratatouille, The Incredibles, Cars, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, Toy Story 1 and 2. I am definitely going to buy the Wall-E DVD, later on, and watch it again. Perhaps because it is different from the rest it has to grow on you and you must see it twice to really appreciate and enjoy it, whereas other Pixars caught on immediately and found a place in my heart after the first viewing.

The messages (ie the environment and love) sent in the movie werent too preachy and overally dramatic. This movie is proof that you can express emotion without many words. I would definitely watch this movie again. It is a timeless masterpiece	5.0	Wall-E hugs your heart	2008-07-05	7	4	3
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1DWYGBIDFNZTX	Gabriella W.	It is virtually impossible to add anything original to the endless list of accolades for this film. Admittedly, I am a HUGE Pixar fan, and await with breathless anticipation every new movie release. As much as I adore all of them, with the Toy Story films being extremely hard to beat, Wall E is the film I actually hold most dear. I remember the exact moment I first fell in love with it (*small spoiler alert). Early on in film (after Wall E's loneliness had been established), he tucked himself into his suspended 'bed' for the night, and gave himself a little push off, so he would rock himself to sleep. Throughout the entire theatre, you heard this 'awwwwww'. It sounds like such a small moment, but was incredibly touching. Isn't that true in life though? Oftentimes it's the smaller moments that mean the most? I could go on for days praising this film, but I will simply say instead to buy this movie, and discover all the moments for yourself. This movie is the reason I go to movies.	5.0	Absolutely perfect	2011-11-23	1	1	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1OB9KPCEWZFSF	Garrett  Lloyd	Pixar has never faulted in making great films that can last, Wall-E is no different. Every Pixar movie is so so creatively different than the previous film that its impossible to guess what is next. Wall-E is much different than previous Pixar films as it goes into the future and space, something only mentioned before.Wall-E gives us all a lesson on protecting the planet. It is thousands of years into the future and earth is no longer habitable from the pollution and junk littered throughout the landscape. Wall-E discovers a plant which leads to an adventure in space with the many humans living on a spaceship. This movie hardly has much dialogue which makes it more creative and in some ways a better movie.  Mainly it is a family movie but it is fun to watch for all ages. Pixar has once again made a great hit and it will last for many years to come.On the DVD: the case itself is eco-friendly which makes it easier to accidently break. The DVD also has only a small bit of special features. But if you just want to watch a movie go ahead and look for the single disc version in a normal DVD case. If you want extra content get the three disc version, but this does have two short films and deleted scenes, but these features don't last very long.	4.0	The best Pixar film in the last few years	2009-07-22	2	1	1
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1ESKGDGJ9RM91	Gary D. Heinz	Lovable for many reasons.  The animation is stunning -- even the most stoic among us should appreciate the 'reality' that has been rendered from mathematical models, and the attention that was given to the most minute details.  Beyond that, the story is charming; I never though I would have 'bought into' a friendship between two robots, but these two are irresistible (and come to think it, why couldn't future machines be programmed with 'emotions' and a sense of self-survival?).  There are plenty of laughs throughout (it may take several viewings to catch them all) and enough light tension to keep one's attention.  It's been commented before that the first half hour or so are a remarkable study in both existentialism and environmentalism, a point with which I agree.  I would have preferred that the creators had left out the holographic billboards that explained the plot, as we eventually would have figured that out (there -- I wanted to get that off my chest!).  WALL-E leaps to new standards of excellence in both animation and storytelling.	5.0	An 'instant classic' that will really be a classic	2009-12-15	1	0	1

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2UYAFQ40U2PHS	"Grigory's Girl ""GR"""	"This film is really two films.  The first half of the film has our beloved Wall E stranded on a planet, trying desperately to clean up the planet.  Then a spaceship arrives, and Wall E falls in love with a female robot.  He then becomes a stowaway on their ship, and arrives in a world with lots (and lots) of lazy, overweight humans.The first half of this film is astonishing.  It's told mostly through visuals, and the little dialogue is ""robot"" talk.  As usual with Pixar, it's amazing to look at.  And you feel the vast and empty wasteland that Wall E is having to deal with.  The addition of the female robot is sweet and touching.  I was totally mesmerized during the first half.  Unfortunately, the 2nd half of the film is preachy with its usual ""humans are stupid and killing the planet"" theme that's been done a lot and it's really done here in an obvious, ponderous, heavy handed way.  We see a ship with humans who are indulging in overeating, no exercise, watching bad TV shows, etc., etc..  It's a rather obvious metaphor for current humans.  It doesn't completely ruin the film, but the 2nd half should have been better.  Its ""message"" is so heavy handed you feel at times like you're being lectured to.  The animation is still great, though, but we've come to expect that from Pixar.Wall E is still worth seeing for its phenomenal first half and the astonishing visuals througout the film."	4.0	First half great, 2nd half preachy...still worth seeing though...	2010-04-21	0	0	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2HVL790PBWYTU	"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read"""	"It's fairly obvious to me that the staff at Pixar has sold its souls to de debbil. There's no other way to explain their staggering success, is there? Hard work? Long hours put in? Talent? Creativity? No, man, it's de debbil!Seriously, though, the folks at Pixar Animated Studios - who last I heard haven't actually signed their names in blood or decapitated goats or anything - well, they've done it again. WALL-E is absolutely terrific. In its artistry and emotional richness and its ability to evoke that sense of wonder, this film ranks right up there with Pixar's best.WALL-E is mostly about a wistful robot in love. There's a damning environmental message, sure, and it's impactful yet not all-intrusive. But it certainly forms the premise of WALL-E's world. In the near future, wasteful consumerism has taken its toll on the planet, its by-product of discarded garbage transforming Earth into a toxic global landfill. While a clean-up program is implemented - to render the planet again habitable - Earth's population is temporarily transferred to a massive luxury liner-class starship. Seven hundred years later, they're still on the ship.Robots aren't supposed to feel loneliness or have dreams and yearnings and such. But, after centuries of quietly toiling away, WALL-E has gone a bit strange, or is the word ""evolved""? WALL-E stands for Waste Allocation Load Lifter, Earth Class, and our little guy is a rusty, antique trash compactor, designed as one of very many. But he's also equipped with huge, surprisingly evocative binocular-looking eyes, so there's no startlement when we're promptly charmed by him. WALL-E is the last of his kind, and, other than his pet cockroach, is the only creature left inhabiting Earth. Every day WALL-E still does his job, faithfully striving to put order to a messed up planet. It all seems futile.WALL-E has over time become a curious collector of things, knick knacks which to him are mostly of indeterminate nature and function. Man's legacy, as seen thru WALL-E's eyes, consists of bubble wraps, cigarette lighters, egg whisks, and Rubik's Cubes. There are two meaningful items he unearths: a video tape of a film musical. And a little green sprout. WALL-E whiles his evenings away by screening the film and perhaps marvelling at the intimacy portrayed on screen. WALL-E's loneliness only grows.One day, a space ship lands and the sleek, shiny probe EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) emerges and shatters WALL-E's placid existence. EVE's programming directs her to search for signs of ongoing photosynthesis, to see if Earth is again ready to sustain life. But, really, she's there to serve as a romantic foil for WALL-E and an impetus to the plot. Soon, WALL-E finds himself venturing beyond his day-to-day drudgery and into a mad quest for romance. Along the way, he ends up saving humanity.Director Andrew Stanton confesses, in the audio commentary, that in preparation for WALL-E he and his crew viewed plenty of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton silent films. This pays off as, even with the dearth of dialogue in WALL-E, there is an eloquence in the evocation of moods. Much of the storytelling is conveyed thru the film's other elements. Thru lighting, thru the score, and thru the robots' limited expressions and thru their physicality. The first half hour is a wonderful study in minimalism of dialogue, as WALL-E and EVE manage to express depths of meaning merely with how they say each other's names (sound designer Ben Burtt, by the way, who voices WALL-E, is priceless). The two droids' voices may be synthetized, but the soulfulness shines thru. WALL-E reminds me quite a bit of a post-apocalyptic episode from The Twilight Zone, in which Charles Bronson and Elizabeth Montgomery are the last two people left on earth, in the aftermath of a devastating war. This episode, poignantly marked with a near absence of dialogue, is titled ""Two"" and remains one of my favorite Twilight Zone stories. It's worth noting that Bronson and Montgomery play two soldiers from opposite sides of the war. Okay, back to WALL-E.The film juggles dystopia with hope, and somewhere along the way it finds moments to take wicked digs at greedy consumerism and our over-reliance on technology. 700 years from now, the life of leisure has been taken to extremes. It's a bit disturbing, gazing at the future of humanity, having grown languid and uniformly obese and wholly dependent on hoverchairs for mobility.I'm not into HELLO, DOLLY! (seeHello, Dolly! Widescreen Edition), but, undeniably, the inclusion of the relentlessly cheery ""Put On Your Sunday Clothes"" and the romantic ""It Only Takes A Moment"" are pivotal. The opening lyrics to ""Put On Your Sunday Clothes"" fits, tongue-in-cheekly: ""Out there is a world outside of Yonkers..."" This, even as the camera pans out over the desolate garbage planet.Can one give enough props to the animation department? Pixar's CG stuff is remarkable yet again, and, in spots, even groundbreaking (again). WALL-E and EVE aren't rendered anthropomorphically, not much anyway. But still the animators figure out a way to make them so expressive. WALL-E, that lonely custodial robot, is brought to amazing life on screen. EVE, the streamlined, ovoid-shaped droid, is nearly as endearing. EVE, in fact, has the longer journey to travel, internally. WALL-E is already in that place. EVE has to get past her programming and learn how to be truly alive.What I have is the single disc movie. The bonus features include: an audio commentary by director Andrew Stanton; the hilarious theatrical short ""Presto"" - a stage magician and his rabbit have a falling out over a carrot; the all-new original short ""BURN-E"" (Remember that robot soldering a lightpost on the ship's exterior? More stuff happens to him); two deleted scenes, with optional intros by the director: ""Garbage Airlock"" (same scene as in the movie, except that WALL-E and EVE's roles are reversed, 6:52 long) and ""Dumped"" (in the completed film, this scene between WALL-E and EVE and the plant takes place in outer space, 2:38 long); The 18-plus-minute-long featurette ""Animation Sound Design: Building Worlds from the Sound Up"" focuses on Ben Burtt and the use of sound design in the film.WALL-E, as is typical with Pixar, caters to all ages. For the young, it's the sheer wonderment of the visuals and the affecting love story. For the young-at-heart, there's the aforementioned stuff, yep, but there are also nuances to savor. And, as this film demonstrates vividly, whatever the age, it's never too late to hold hands with that someone."	5.0	"""Out there is a world outside of Yonkers..."""	2008-11-23	6	6	0

The visual and audio quality is beautiful.The BluRay ""features"" of this apparently mean that it is a BR-Java disc, which means that you can't resume play of the movie at any point like you can with a normal BluRay. Which makes this an extremely frustrating movie to watch if you ever have to stop it.This is particularly because I was initially having trouble getting surround sound until I put my PS3 in ""Bitstream"" audio mode instead of ""Linear PCM"" which is the default. I must have watched the opening Disney cruft at least 20x trying to get the audio sorted.Another very annoying privacy violation by this BR disc: When I allowed it to download updates from the internet (something I normally do not do), it somehow PERMANENTLY set the ""Allow disc to connect to the internet"" to Always Allow instead of Always Ask.To be honest, if I had it to do over again I probably would have just gotten the DVD version."	2.0	"Great movie, great hi-def, wretched Bluray ""features"""	2009-05-13	4	1	3

I'm proud to say Wall-E is one of the exceptions. Obviously geared primarily towards kids, Pixar and Disney have managed to throw enough adult-themed content into the movie to make it interesting.A portion of the movie contains almost zero dialogue, and the story between Wall-E and Eva is told primarily through physical humor and a variety of beeps and electronic sounds. What's more amazing is that it's done in a way you can tell exactly what they are communicating without them needing to use language to do so. A feat that few recent movies can boast of, even WITH the use of language.If you haven't seen this movie, you need to. Regardless of whether you pay $2 to rent it, or $20 to buy it, it's worth it.	4.0	Amazing movie, considering the lack of dialogue.	2012-04-20	2	2	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AKBHAYQTQMUHI	"Hillevi Peterson ""Teacher, Musician, and Stor..."	"Writer/director Andrew Stanton goes boldly where men and women have been longing for Pixar to go: space, the promising frontier. I can just imagine all of the beloved geeks at Pixar scrambling to get their audio/visual reference to their favorite sci-fi novel or flick onto the desktop of this film. Sitting in the theater opening night, we note that when Jim Reekes' infamous Mac start up C chord played as Wall-E recharged, the room broke into cheers and applause.Reason # 1 to buy Wall-E: Watching this DVD gives allows us to fulfill the geek challenge -- counting the variations on a theme by Straus (Also Sprach Zarathustra) and finding the additional film cross references i.e. Star Wars, 2001, Star Trek, and even One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest gets a nod!Reason # 2 to buy Wall-E: For those who are not sci-fi fans, Wall-E will still hold your heart with it's endearing story lines, ever present excellent Pixar character development. Each supporting robot still serves a purpose and has a personality as well as a specific sound.Which leads us to Reason # 3 to buy Wall-E: Sound Design. This is an Oscar category Wall-E can't lose, and is the BEST additional feature of the DVD: animation sound design. This juicy presentation is where the average film viewer gets to meet Ben Burtt, the sound design creative genius behind, not only Wall-E, but the sound FX on ET, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and The Dark Crystal!Reason # 4 to buy Wall-E: It's an excellent family film. Once again Pixar gives us an animation classic that the entire family can enjoy. An interesting note is how for the first 40 minutes everyone is entertained without verbal dialogue therefore reemphasizing what a visual society we have become.Reason # 5 to buy Wall-E: The third disc includes a bonus digital copy of the film to drop onto your iPod for those spontaneous feel good moment needs anywhere. Oh, yes -- there is that subtle cross reference to Apple's iPod as Wall-E watches Michael Crawford, before he became the Phantom of the Opera, sing ""It Only Takes a Moment"" from Hello Dolly.And finally, Wall-E reminds us how the simple gesture of holding someone's hand can make us feel more secure in an ever changing world...or how to propel yourself across the universe with a fire extinguisher."	5.0	"WALL-E PLUS the always excellent ""Making of..."""	2008-12-02	3	3	0

A sad situation indeed.So I will go on to say, if you're attention span is that of a spoiled, A.D.D child, then this film will not be for you.However if you actually appreciate art, & would like to see an entirely new spin on a very familiar theme, then this is a must.	5.0	Simply Amazing	2008-11-29	2	1	1

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A34R39IAPS2OEE	Humble Pi	"This is my first written impressions of the movie (and blu-ray release) of Wall*E. I love this movie because of its details of environment and sound, lots of interesting and effective emotive characters, humor, cuteness, and central themes.  Combined with an engaging good story and eye-candy in computer graphics, it ranks up there with Toy Stories as my top animation films.  Wall*E is definitely my favorite film for 2008 and is my first Pixar blu-ray.Unlike the DVD and Blu-ray releases of Ratatouille (I have the DVD), the special features included with the 3-disc Blu-ray of Wall*E will keep you glued to the screen for hours.  So far, all the bonus features are in 1080p HD, many of which are 16x9 1.85.1 aspect ratio.  I watched the feature, ""The Pixar Story,"" with great interest and was delighted to see clips of previous Pixar films in HD.  There is a short scene of Star Wars in HD, too.  I can't wait until both Toy Stories are released in blu-ray.I had forgotten that Wall*E included an animation short.  I saw this film once in theater when it came out this past June.  Presto looks absolutely incredible in 1080p/24! It's also a fun and clever animation to watch.This release of Wall*E is well worth the money.  The picture and sound quality are excellent.  I will need to watch this film a few times to adjust my 5.1 speaker setup.  I have not looked at the digital copy on the 3rd disc, but will see if it works on my ipod nano.  I'm curious about the next Pixar release called ""UP.""Update: Yep, Wall*E looks great on my iPod nano (though widescreen mode is a bit small and pan/scan mode cuts off the right/left portion of the movie when using my nano).  However, setting the nano to widescreen, TV out, compressed MPEG-4 copy of the movie is very watchable on my Sony HDTV.  The stereo sound is top notch, too."	5.0	Space Age Love Among a Flock of Robots	2008-11-16	4	4	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	ABGI47M9U8QP2	"Hyped1 ""Game Maker"""	The video, audio. and overall quality of this release is superb all the way around! Their new virtual camera rig makes this movie seem almost documentary style in it's realism. It feels like it was actually filmed not made on computers and gives it an inviting organic feel. The fact there is no dialog for a very good portion of the film yet you always know what's going on is a testament to the amazing quality of animation and storytelling. The dusty earth feels desolate and run down while the space shots and pristine almost sterile white of the spaceship seem to glow with energy. if you have a TV capable of 1080p this is a must have! The completely digital transfer is immaculate in it's quality and holds up perfectly from frame to frame. A real show off of any Hi-Fi TV/ Surround sound setup!Besides all the usual extras found on other DVD's such as behind the scenes and so forth, this actually contains a FULL 90 min documentary all about the creation of Pixar, and thus the creation of computer animated movies. It's called The Pixar Story and If you are an animation junkie like me, love all the Pixar films, or simply want to know more about the history of arguably the best artist in animation today this film is a must see!	5.0	Wall-e is a must have if you still have a soul and enjoy smiling!	2008-12-21	1	1	0

Well Wall-E can come to my island.I originally rented this to watch with my young nieces but we all loved it so much that I had to purchase a copy. In fact, I'm not ashamed to say that I have (re)watched Wall-E when the kids weren't around. I'm an environmentally conscious person so this movie is up my alley but I also think it's an amazing teaching tool for parents and anyone involved with children. It makes the difficult topic of environmental conservation and garbage dumps simple to understand - as well as the repercussions of ignoring these issues. It doesn't have a political slant, although it does jab at the advertising industry a bit, this movie is more of a logical if/then type of statement. This movie was well done.

I watch lot's of movies and I read a lot of amazon reviews but this is my very first movie review. I just couldnt help myself. Wall-E has Moved me to write a review,this movie was just that good.When I rented this movie from Blockbuster it was only because the Blockbuster guy recommended it because I needed a sixth movie to get for free. I didnt know what to expect. I hadnt heard much about it though I am a science nerd and I especially like space science so I figured what the heck.Wall-E is the perfect movie. It has what many movies nowadays seem to lack... MEANING. It was funny, heartfelt, well-developed, thoughtfull, and entertaining. The lack of dialouge, I feel does not take away from the movie at all. I dont know how many movies Ive wathced lately where the generic, stereo-typical and obnoxious dialouge totally kill half-ass decent movies. So if anything the mininal but clever script of Wall-E is a long awaited breathe of fresh non-polluted air. What this movie may lack in words it more than makes up for in its message, which Im not going to get into cause theres no way you can miss it after watching this movie. Wall-E is also as we've come to expect from Pixar visually stunning and though at time a bit dark and gloomy its still very engaging.I totally agree with the many reviews that have declared Wall-E a MASTERPIECE. Moving, a great story and a strong message to back it up Wall-E is a precious gem and I strongly recommend it to anyone who just needs a breathe of fresh air.	5.0	Im In LOVE	2010-08-14	1	1	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AQOCDX3CD2BWU	Irrational Love99	"I realized that my review list would never be complete without a warm and loving nod to Disney-Pixar's 2008 masterpiece and my favorite film, WALL-E.Taking place hundreds of years in the future, WALL-E tells the imaginative but soberingly feasible tale of an Earth that has become so littered with trash that rising toxicity levels have forced all of mankind to board an enormous spacecraft and travel into space for a '5-year cruise' whilst a fleet of little robots are left on the planet to handle the mess. The robots, called WALL-Es (Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth class), are designed to compact the trash into small cubes and use those cubes to build giant trash towers. Then the incinerators that had been erected prior to the evacuation were to burn the towers, gradually making life on Earth sustainable once more. The plan backfires when the incinerators topple to the ground and all but one of the robots malfunction. The surviving Wall-E develops sentience and a charming character, and spends his days compacting trash and collecting human paraphernalia. While not unhappy with his life, his complete and utter lack of companionship (save for one humorously indestructible pet cockroach) has made Wall-E quite the lonely heart. That all changes one day when a spaceship mysteriously lands on the planet and drops off a high-tech female android named EVE. Wall-E falls completely in love with the beguiling newcomer and realizes that his feelings for her far outweigh the importance of following his programmed directive. When the ship returns days later to take Eve away, Wall-E clings to the hull in hot pursuit, willing to travel across the galaxy in order to win the heart of his lady friend. And the result is nothing short of spectacular.It is difficult to fully articulate the sheer beauty of this film. It is quite the Mary Poppins of animated movies: Practically perfect in every way. The animation is flawless and has a realistic quality to it that is often stunning, composer Thomas Newman is at his finest with the breathtaking score (the moment when Wall-E sees Eve for the first time never fails to strum my heartstrings), even the cinematography is lovely; I understand that director Andrew Stanton went to great lengths to make the movie appear as though it was filmed with a camera rather than simply animated, and it shows. But best of all, Wall-E and Eve have one of the most compelling fictional relationships I have ever had the pleasure of watching unfold, animated or otherwise. Wall-E is lovableness personified; his disarmingly sweet disposition and childlike fascination with the world around him endears him to the viewer quickly and easily, and Eve's mysterious, feminine charm makes her just as appealing. I laugh, I cry, I fall in love watching them fall in love. Not bad for a couple of machines who utter absolutely no verbal dialogue for the first 22 minutes of the film. Admittedly, pantomime has never bothered me (I love Charlie Chaplin), but I feel strongly that this movie could win the heart of pretty much anyone, even those who don't care for silent films (or, as Mr. Stanton puts it, a film with ""nontraditional dialogue""); it is just that good! The offbeat but decidedly human romance between these two characters somehow manages to be innocent and sweet and yet beautifully sophisticated at the same time, and I never tire of watching Eve evolve from the cold, aloof robot that she was programmed to be into the caring and humane soul that Wall-E helps her to become. ""Irrational love defeats life's programming"" is the unspoken message in this cinematic joyride, and for this infatuated reviewer, it was irrational love at first showing.I could prattle on, but there's not much more to tell. This delightful love story is poignant, powerful, surprisingly mature and just plain magical. No more, no less.Dear friend, enjoy and rejoice!"	5.0	Ode to joy...and Pixar's finest	2014-06-30	0	0	0

What's more on a sensitive subject that is dealt with in such extreme terms that it becomes terroristic. Terroristically antipollution. Terroristically anti-obesity. Terroristically anti-machine and anti-corporation. And on the other side there are two robots who fall in love - ah ah ah I laugh, it is so romantic, the love of a piece of junk with another piece of junk - a cockroach who is definitely not heavy enough to rebalance the situation. A pathetic lack of imagination with even the Zarathustra of Strauss and the allusion to 2001, the Space Odyssey, an allusion that no kid can understand. Walt Disney is winking at the curators of the museum of cinematographic antiquities. In other words it can work in the US because they have no competition from the rest of the world YET.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1Y7PVYQ9NOHLB	Jake	If Pixar has taught me anything over the years it is to never doubt them. No matter what the story is about, Pixar always produces top-notch entertainment for all ages.  I expected nothing less from WALL-E and I'm thrilled to say I wasn't disappointed. In fact, Pixar may have just delivered their most beloved character to date.Pixar's animation is always second to none and WALL-E is the most awe-inspiring effort yet. The animation is so good in fact, that many of the scenes make you forget you are watching an animated film. Every detail of every scene is fantastic eye candy that makes you want to pause each frame to get a better look.The story itself is well crafted and easy enough to follow for both children and adults. There are a lot of really fun sci-fi elements that add a clever dose of creativity to the story. The first half hour of the film is almost completely dialogue free, yet the film never lags or loses steam from the opening frame. When we do enter scenes with more character interaction and action sequences it is well worth the wait.WALL-E himself is a milestone achievement for Pixar. He is a robot of few words, but his heart and humility are what draws the audience to him. We effectively feel every emotion WALL-E feels and you can't help but love this delightful character. The romance between WALL-E and EVE is adorable and engaging bringing a human quality to both characters. The lengths both characters go to in order to be together are touching to say the least.Throughout the film we do get somewhat heavy-handed messages about environmental protection issues and corporate conglomerates taking over the world. I personally could have done without some of these elements, but overall I feel like they were handled in just the right way to carry the story along.In the end, WALL-E is a beautiful film about love and friendship and the priceless value of both. Once again Pixar has exceeded my expectations and I'm beginning to think they can do no wrong. WALL-E is a true gem the whole family will fall in love with.	5.0	Pixar's Most Beloved Character To Date	2008-06-30	10	7	3

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1V3TRGWOMA8LC	"James Beswick ""Thanks for your time"""	Wow. I was lucky enough to see this at a screening in Pixar studios, and now I've just bought the DVD and watched it again. Wall-E harks back to the days of the silent movie, when dialog was not used as a substitute for story unfolding visually, and it succeeds triumphantly in reeling in the audience. Not only is the central relationship both touching and funny at the same time, it's founded in a very dark future where humans have trashed the earth and live lazily on an off-planet ship. To succeed in combining these plotlines shows how mature Pixar has become in creating compelling stories, and making movies that both kids and adults both enjoy.This is Pixar's best film to date (not that any of their previous movies have been anything less than outstanding), and it speaks to their remarkable talents that the 5-minute Presto short before the film is more entertaining that most live-action films have been this year. I think this is also Pixar's most technically advanced animation to date, in terms of simulating camera moves, lighting and art direction from live action science fiction.If you haven't see Wall-e already, this may be the best $15 you spend this year!(PS - As an aside, Ben Burtt is a very nice guy - the BURN-E noise is an electric shaver and the laser gun effects were made using a Slinky. :-))	5.0	Best Film Oscar for 2009?	2008-12-03	0	0	0

If you're a parent too then you'll know what I'm talking about.The Incredibles was the best Pixar film made thus far, in my opinion. It also my opinion that WALL-E is the worst so far from Pixar. The simple reason is that it is light on good story and heavy on pro-environmentalist messaging.Yes, I know this bucks the PC trend of reviewers raving how great this movie is, but honestly, I was bored. My kids thought it was ""okay."" After my kids saw The Incredibles they were bouncing off the walls and couldn't wait to own it. I don't think they have any interest in ever owning this movie.The message of the movie is that your typical overweight hyper-consuming American is killing the earth. This is a futuristic tale of how said fatso yanks have killed said planet, and largely don't care because they're too busy floating around in hover chairs scarfing junk food and watching TV, kind of like a lot of people do now, except in space.Oh yeah, and there's something about robots who have no identifiable reproductive organs who still want to get it on. Seriously, WALL-E must be into the whole dominatrix thing because Eve packs a heavy-duty laser cannon and ain't afraid to use it.Now before all the tree huggers freak on me, I'm all for saving the earth. I am not a hyper-consumer and I often run to work instead of drive. When I do drive, it's a 1.6 liter Honda Civic. I think environmental stewardship is important, but I don't want to be guilt tripped into it at a kid's movie.The Incredibles is everything that this movie was not. The Incredibles is a great tale of a super family who have some righteous butt-kicking adventures and it allows kids and parents alike to escape reality for a while, which is what family movies are supposed to do.If I wanted to get bummed out about the state of our environment, I'd watch An Inconvenient Truth.Pixar needs to stop with trying to insinuate their political agendas into its movies and get back to good old fashioned story telling."	2.0	Was Al Gore Executive Producer?	2008-07-25	48	7	41
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AL5OEDM8TPTKV	James Hiller	Pixar can do so many things, and do them so well. They can take children's toys and bring them to magical life. They can take a fish with a gimpy fin and make him a superhero. They can take a souped up automobile and make him take the easy road. And they can take a mouse and make him the top chef. How they ever managed to take two machines, one which is a glorified garbageman, and make them fall in love is simply beyond me. They are the true magic makers of our time, and paired with Disney, they are in the business of making a series of movies that, 50 years from now, will be considered classics.Wall-E spins the tale of a plucky, musical loving robot whose only job in this world, literally, is to rake up garbage and make them into little square boxes. Spending his days doing that, Wall-E works until sunset when he gets to go home, remove his treads, and watch a little Hello, Dolly. That is, until he meets another robot, a svelte white examination robot named Eve. She's there on a mission, which unfolds very delicately, allowing time for the scared and timid Wall-E to approach her and try to woo her with his life.What follows absolutely blew my mind, both in it's complexity of messages and its shear entertainment value. Wall-E takes us into a future that may seem ridiculous on the screen, but you question, after only watching for a few minutes, how close we are to seeing that future here on Earth. I won't write any spoilers here, but as you laugh at some of the funny sights you see halfway through this remarkable film, you also are half-wondering at what point will this be us ... and is it already?The brilliance of the animation is a sight to behold. Pixar grows with every picture it makes, and Wall-E is a technical achievement of the highest order. The attention to detail is phenomenal, and literally awe-inspiring.  As Wall-E shovels piles of trash around, the dirt and dust and filth look real. In fact, that is the beautiful irony of this film. In a movie about robots, we find some essence of what it is to be human, what makes us tick, and what makes our planet more real than we know.  We should be better people to heed the message of Wall-E, and learn from it.I highly recommend taking everyone in your family to see this film. It's the cinematic event of the summer.	5.0	A vision of post- apocalyptic love	2008-06-27	18	14	4

I was there when they began and i grew up with their films, seeing every one of them in theaters and owning more than a normal amount of their merchandise. I was excited to see andrew stanton's sophmore directorial work at pixar and i was not dissapointed. this film is literally a masterpiece, you forget you're watching an animated family film after a while. it's dark, honest, and so absolutely beautiful, your jaw will be dropped and you will laugh alot. this film is funny and smart and is steering pixar in a whole new direction, now with that being said, i immediatley anticipated the dvd release of the film. after some lousy dvd releases for the last couple years (the incredibles being their last release to recieve a special edition), it was time for them to finaly go back to their hefty special edition packages, and once again i was not dissapointed. Literally up to the very day this dvd came out, i still was not sure what exactly i was getting. all the different versions and what not, it was hard to distinguish what came on what. so i finally cracked it open to see for myself and i was very pleased.for a standard dvd, the picture, sound and film itself is like i said, incredible. so, considering i already went off about the film itself i'll just say i give it10/10now for all of you who are still confused exactly what these features include on the 3 disc standard release, i;m going to tell you once and for all.first off, the packaging is way different from pixar's past releases. no slip case, no plastic case, none of that. instead, going along with the film's moral, the dvd comes in an eco friendly cardboard type case. for the 3 disc relase you pull open one side which reveals the first disc and the list of scenes and bonus features, you pull open the other side and that reveals the 2nd and 3rd disc along with a list of features. the case idea is kind of cool but can be frustrating to remove the discs and what not.now for the actual content....i didn't have a chance to actually explore everything but i gota good idea of it all and the length and layout for everything. the first disc has the feature film, the short film, ""presto"" and the new to dvd short, burn-e(which is pretty funny but has alot of filler moments with actual clips from the movie to develop the story). there is also a featurette that talks with ben burt, the man behind the voice of wall-e. and wall-e's tour of the universe. there is also 2 deleted scenes that total in at around 10 minutes. the second disc has two pathways, kind of like the monsters inc dvd....""humans"" and ""robots""  humans section is more adult oriented and includes all the insight and goodies....the robots section is more for the kids and includes the animated storybook, and a couple other minescule features. the humans section is where it's all at. for the longest time it said there would be ""making of"" featurettes and i thought, ""what making of featurettes, it doesn't say"" wellthere are a handful of featurettes about different aspects of the film and the total time for all these is almost an hour long!  the bnl shorts consist of 5, 2 minute long ""instructional"" films. another big feature is the full legnth documentary entitled 'the pixar sory"" (86 minutes long)this disc also includes 2 more deleted scenes that are a total of about 14 minutes long.It'salways great to see a digital copy of any of your favorite films. i'm kind of new to this whole digital copy thing and i only have 2 other films in digital copy form. i was excited to get this onto my ipod but noticed that, unlike the other movies i have, this isnt meant to fit to screen. to only truly fit everything in the movie on the secreen, you have to play it in widescreen which if you have a regular video ipod like me, is kind of straining for the eyes.Ok, so i rambled on about the dvd and other stuff for too long, but i have to say i'm glad to see pixar is really caring about the dvd again. i'm still bummed blu ray owners still get slightly more features on their version. i'll have to put that on my x-mas list :)"	5.0	"for all those who are wondering: ""what exactly is in this beefed up editon?"""	2008-11-18	14	14	0

The anticpation was greater than any other movie released in the summer of 2008.Both of my sons gave this movie their ""GG"" rating -- Good! Good! They've never offered anything higher than ""GGG"" so I translated their rating into a four-star review here.The first 25 minutes of this movie worried me because there's no dialogue, but Pixar had my kids captivated.

That or Kung Fu Panda.  I recommended the latter for a youngin of such a tender Dora the Explorer loving age.  And why not, there's hardly any talking in Wall*E.For some the lack of language may recall the 1988 film The Bear where an equally cute lead character was all alone experiencing the world.  I know I flashed back, but the similarities ended with cute doe eyed expressions shared by both leads.Wall*E is a wonderfully entertaining, and dare I say it, subversive movie.  Rarely have I seen such overt socio-political commentary in any film, let alone a Disney partner production.Sure we've seen our fair share of post-apocalyptic world horrors, but post-consumption devastation?  Now there's an equally likely scenario, if not more so given the West's taste for disposable consumption AND it's drive to share that taste with people's of developing nations.(If you haven't visited a developing country then it may come as a shock that the consumer mentality is part of the democratic export package.)All heaviness aside, this was a purely entertaining and charming film.  I can see it going right over the heads of the 8 and under crowd...there's a real risk of boredom with some of the early portions of the film.  I suppose that could be said for other flicks, such as I Am Legend, but isolated lead characters hardly bust a blockbuster.Overall, I was extremely pleased with giving nearly two hours of my life to this movie and would recommend it as a way to generate discussion with our society's youth about the practical consequences of disposable consumptive behavior (not saying the giant spaceship was a practical or realistic consequence...more like a metaphor or something.)	5.0	Wall*E: A Cartoon for the Thinking Brain	2008-07-16	7	5	2

With such high praise going in, it is probably not surprising that I came away disappointed.That being said, I should state that the visual quality and effects rendering were mind-blowing quality. Completely awe inspiring and stunning in every way you might imagine.But the flow and pace of the story was totally insufficient for me to sustain my enthusiasm. Perhaps it was the overtly political Malthusian anti-human stereotypes, or just the fact that there was no real dialogue for the first half of the file...hard to say. Once aspect of previous Pixar movies that I have enjoyed is the witty banter and repartee of the characters. There was none of that in this film. Yes, the robots were very physically expressive, but that was not enough to make up for the missing ingredients."	2.0	Had me bored to tears. Were my expectations too high?	2008-12-07	21	7	14
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A37N1RXM3GWI01	JasonCL	I missed out on Wall-E while it was in theaters this summer. However I still blind-bought the Blu-ray since people had nothing but great things to say about Pixar's latest film. I'm happy to say that this is definitely one of the best Blu-ray releases that I own.The movie itself is a masterpiece. It's one of the best movies of 2008 for sure, and I'd put it as my 2nd favorite Pixar film behind Toy Story. In addition, you get a lot of great features across the 2-disc set. The shining star is The Pixar Story, which is a documentary covering the creation and success of the animation giant that is Pixar Studios. It's eighty-something minutes long and is practically a second movie that Disney stuffed inside this release. The Pixar Story is an awesome bonus that shouldn't be missed. There's also your standard making of documentaries and some animated shorts (Wall-E related or not) that are worth checking out.Wall-E on Blu-ray gets a definite 5-star rating and is a must buy for anyone who owns a Blu-ray player.	5.0	Superb Blu-ray release for a magical film	2008-12-17	2	1	1

Shimkus ""Movie Manji"""	Pixar has made Toys seem Human with a working (sort of) fragil democracy, Monsters that are also scared, A kingdom of Animals, Cars/Machines dealing with issues, SuperHeroes saving their degenerating family values from shattering, and all of that vast, motley, sometimes not living, beings with Human characteristics; and to me, the next creative step For Pixars Frankenstein-like attempts to Humanize was first tackled by the great Science Fiction writer Isaac Assimov which is consciousness in Robots or Androids. And in Wall.E we see rather Matter-of-factly robot wanna-be being that has all the emotions and consciousness of a child (an adorable child at that). Wall.E does possess surprisingly serious messages for our own generation that have nothing to do with the Science Fiction that is at its core but I found the Dark Warnings against Marching Moderness better suited for the GreatGhost in the ShellWhere we are put to the question in unpredictable/unexpected ways. The enemy is the very oppossite of Wall.E, A non-sadening, conscious free Robot/s; the Helm looks, I'm sure by no accident, like the Hal System from2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition). This movie has outstanding Special effects that will be hard to impress those little ones that have seen every Pixar film before this. But as Critical Audiance member, I have to give it a very pleasing and trademarked Thumbs up. In the end, for me, and also the almost lunatic, maniacal children that could not sit still nor be forced into silence, I must say there is something lacking in the story that does not surpase Pixars Real Masterpiece which completely captivated child and adult alike:The Incredibles (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	4.0	A logical next step for Pixar	2008-07-07	5	2	3

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A19IVLRFTU2PDP	Jericho Pryce	"Note: The following review may possibly contain minor plot points or spoilersBefore entering in to the theater on Wall-E's release I thought that Pixar was one of the greater animation studios of the new millennium; after seeing Wall-E, not only am I convinced that Pixar is the greatest modern animation studio, but perhaps one of the most talented and treasured film companies in the history of cinema, with writer-director Andrew Stanton at the head of the pack. Stanton has not only managed to create a technical marvel, with Wall-E pushing the boundaries of computer animation technology to the limits, but also a work of pure art that contains more emotion and character than this entire years worth of movies put together.The film starts off on a simultaneously sweet and sour note: The opening frames reveal the gorgeous backdrop of special galaxies and stars, with music from the movie-musical Hello-Dolly! overlapping it all in a sugary visual treat. Not seconds later, the camera traverses space to slowly close in on the planet Earth, which some 700 years in to the future has gained a sickly green tint to it as well as an orbital atmosphere of pure garbage. Further zooming reveals a desolated city (New York, maybe?) its buildings and bridges rotted way. The entire opening is vey reminiscent of the recent I Am Legend, except much, much more ruined. It is however, technically beautiful; the images are so photorealistic that you're amazed that they've been generated by computer.The only remnants of humanity are monstrous skyscrapers of compacted trash and billboards aplenty advertising the bright and colorful, yet somehow ominous company known as Buy n' Large, a thinly veiled Wal-Mart clone. And, of course, Wall-E itself.Wall-E is far more than a mere 'it', however. Through hundreds of nuanced and heartfelt animation quirks, as well as the ""voice"" given by Ben Burtt, Star-Wars techie and creator of another famed beeping robot named R2-D2, Wall-E has been imbued with enough life to fill three-dozen cheap summer kids flicks (Space Chimps, really?), all without ever saying more than two or three actual words. It is this achievement that Pixar should be commended for.Wall-E has been operating for centuries, long after his other Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class counterparts have shut down or broken apart, scouring the wastelands of earth and compacting the land's garbage in to neat little cubes that are stacked into the previously mentioned monoliths of refuse.It is a long and lonely job, with the little robot's only companion being a spunky little cockroach. Wall-E has over the years collected an impressive amount of junk with which he passes the time, including lighters, toys, clothes, spare parts, and an old VHS copy of Hello Dolly!, which is Wall-E's instructor in the ways of life, love, and keenly choreographed dance. Indeed, Wall-E gazes upon two lovers holding hands and the look in his binocular eyes is both heartbreaking and beautiful.It all changes however, when a beautiful (and presumably female) robot from the human colony in space arrives; her name is EVE. Despite here tendencies to blow up anything that so much as flutters in the breeze, Wall-E is smitten at first sight, and EVE comes to eventually share those feelings. After taking note of a very unique possession of Wall-E's however, EVE reports back to the Earth ship axiom and is whisked away back in to space. Wall-E, being as devoted and golden-hearted as he is, follows her into the unknown, and it is there that the movie really gets going, with Wall-E and EVE taking part in an adventure with the fate of humanity itself in the balance. Characters like the Captain of the Axiom (voiced by Jeff Garlin) appear to flesh out the film's plot, as well as a gaggle of amusing ""rogue"" robots that aide Wall-E and EVE in their quest.As the movie develops, however, the leading characters' romance becomes the core of the movie, with Wall-E and EVE's love being one of the few genuinely lovely and convincing romances of recent cinema. The touching moments Wall-E shares with EVE in his workshop, as well as their first ""kiss"", preceding a marvelous dance through space highlight a relationship that tugs at the heartstrings and moistens the eyes far more than movies like Fool's Gold or What Happens in Vegas. The romance between the two leads is the very soul of the movie, and could not have been more well executed.The film is gorgeous to boot: With colors and images that dazzle, and linger with you long after the film is over.  Films like No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood, as beautiful as they are, seem to revel in the gloom of browns and blacks. Wall-E, on the other is vibrant and alive, turning even the beginning's post-apocalyptic wasteland in to a marvel. The further adventures on the human colony ship, the Axiom, juxtapose it so well that it almost seems like two different films.I haven't even mentioned the wonderful score composed by Thomas Newman, who is accompanied by some fantastic guest-compososers,  which is ambient and beautiful and perfectly accompanies eveything that I love about the movie.The biggest surprise of Wall-E, however, would be its surprising amount of maturity. Wall-E deals with themes of pollution, rampant consumerism, societal complacency and obesity, media desensitization, and other themes that would frankly fly over a child's head. Kids will see a world full of people who are humorously fat and happy; older members of the audience, however, will see a society that tells of a future not centuries ahead of us but perhaps only decades. The overblown laziness and rampant consumerism is evident already today, and the notion of Wall-E's future being so similar is funny yes, but also a touch unnerving.It is for this reason that I hold Wall-E in such high esteem: It is a heartfelt work of inarguable art that not only entertains up the wazoo but holds enough conscience and commentary to get even the most casual of moviegoer thinking about the future. It is beautiful and it is heartbreaking. It is funny and it is also a tad scary. It two robots teaching humanity the very meaning of being human, as well as learning the meaning of true love themselves. It made me laugh, it made me (almost) cry. It has the distinction of being Pixar's best movie, as wells as the hands down best movie of the year (so far); an almost perfect, if not completely perfect summer movie that kids and adults will almost assuredly love.And it is also one of the greatest movies I have ever seen."	5.0	The Most Entertaining and Heartfelt Movie I've seen inYears	2008-08-21	9	8	1

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A39K2SHTDLUBRA	Jimmy Maher	I'd seen Wall-E once before, when it was in theaters, but I was struck all over again by just how smart this movie is, and how much faith it places in it audience. Just think about the breadth of the narrative world it creates: a world in which mankind has destroyed the earth, but a subsection of the presumably wealthy were able to escape on a luxury spaceship to wait for things to get better planetside; in which those escapees have grown fat, lazy, and stupid over generations of said waiting. And that's just the backstory. In the film itself we see the system of probes that the ship uses to continually analyze conditions on earth, and see how the evacuees finally make their return to earth and begin to rebuild. The technological systems the film portrays feel logical and believable, if one is willing to make allowances for cartoon logic. Still, all of this takes place at the margins, leaving room in the center for the real heart of the film, a convoluted love story about two really cute cartoon robots. Not bad for 90 minutes. And most remarkably, all of this is conveyed using an absolute minimum of dialog, with most of the story told purely through visuals and sound. I'm sure there are considerably more words in this review than there are in Wall-E itself.Also embedded within the film are additional layers of subtext, of in-jokes and cultural references for those in the know, such as the Sputnik satellite which bashes into Wall-E as he is rocketed into space while clinging to the side of a returning probe ship. The most obvious and repeated homages are to one of my all-time favorite films, Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. The villain in Wall-E was obviously inspired by HAL, right down to his single staring red eye and his passive-aggressive way of speaking. And in an unusually unsubtle move, the filmmakers explicitly invoke 2001 when the captain gets onto his feet for the first time, playing the legendary (and cliched) Also Sprach Zarathustra theme and consciously echoing the scene in 2001 where the man-apes begin to use tools for the first time.The parallels between the two films also run deeper than these conscious references. Like 2001, Wall-E has -- one satirical commercial aside -- no dialog at all for its first 30 minutes, and uses dialog only sparsely thereafter. And both are, in their own ways, about a moment of transcendence for the human race. Of course, both films are also products of their times, 2001 reflecting the quasi-mystical beatitude of the Age of Aquarius and Wall-E being full of our own era's angst about environmental destruction and the depersonalizing -- not to say degrading -- effects of technology and big media. (How ironic, then, that this film was distributed by the biggest media of all, the Disney Corporation.)That's a lot of thematic weight for a cartoon to carry, but Wall-E does it admirably. When I compare it with any number of brain-dead Hollywood action flicks, I'm left to ponder why it is that some of the best and most sophisticated films to come out of major studios are cartoons marketed primarily to children -- and what (if anything) does that say about the state of modern culture? Ah, well... I adore Wall-E. And I don't even like cartoons.	5.0	Robot Odyssey	2011-03-08	0	0	0

But, it also provides a challenge to our modern age of glut and excess.  When we value our ease and comfort over the needs of the world and environment, we risk running into the same traps as the people in this movie.  Wall-E is a lovable robot who heroically attempts to save a tiny plant, and ultimately the fate of our planet. His efforts are valiant, and even though he cannot talk, he communicates love, compassion and a drive that most of us non-robots do not have. Every time I watch it, I am encouraged to exercise more, and to care for this lovely world a bit more. I think that is the point they were trying to make.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AKT8TGIT6VVZ5	John Kwok	"Each time I have seen a film from Pixar Studio, I have been impressed not only with its animation, but excellent plot too. This time, however, Pixar Studio has rendered a true cinematic animation masterpiece, one which should be recognized as memorable as the great Walt Disney films of the 1930s and 1940s. A masterpiece which ought to appeal to kids of all ages. In ""Wall - E"" Pixar has a spellbinding example - maybe the first - of a romantic science fiction thriller that lacks a dull moment, even though much of the film lacks substantial dialogue. So who cares whether the robot Wall - E can speak fluent English; audiences will recognize him as an admirable and lovable creature, whose very actions remind me at least of Charlie Chaplin's dull-witted tramp (Indeed, I wouldn't be surprised at all if this was the intention of Pixar Studio's animators and writers.).Centuries after humanity has fled a severely over-polluted Earth for the relatively clean sanctuary of interstellar space, Wall - E  toils alone as the very last trash compactor robot, in the deserted ruins of what seems to be New York City.  Then one day Wall - E's fate is literally sent from the Heavens, with the arrival of a strange new robot. What follows will truly delight the hearts and cheer the souls of children of all ages. Older ""children"" may grasp some of the subtle sociological and political references scattered throughout the film, but younger ones will recognize that this is a film focused primarily on the themes of friendship, love and romance. A film that I am certain is destined to become a major landmark in the annals of cinematic animation; one that is a masterpiece already."	5.0	A Masterpiece of Cinematic Animation	2008-07-03	9	5	4

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A356HRZZFCEGL1	"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos"""	"*** This review may contain spoilers ***I do regret missing seeing ""WALL-E"" on the big screen, so I had to console myself by watching this ""mechanical"", post-utopic, sci-fi romance melodrama on Encore at home. My attitude towards the overall product is somewhat ambivalent. Overall, I am generally glad that I saw it, but I am leery of comments declaring it a complete masterpiece. Make no mistake; WALL-E solidifies Pixar's impressive track record of entertaining movies with something substantial to say, but I felt that in the last analysis it gives its unassuming protagonist a little bit of short shrift.WALL-E (hereafter WALL-ET because of his obvious homage to ET and his beneficial effect upon Pixar's revenues, hee-hee) is a bit of a Frankenstein. In addition to ET, he is also an amalgamated mash-up of R2-D2, Johnny 5 from the ""Short Circuit"" films, the gardening droids from ""Silent Running"", and even the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. This sentient trash disposal unit lives a near solitary existence on a trash-besotted Earth in the 29th century. Ironically, although it looks like a sepia-toned nuclear wasteland, Earth just choked up on its own refuse. Humans have abandoned the planet and plan to return when Earth is once again habitable. WALL-ET's eternal job is to clean the rubbish one cube at a time. He has done this so long he has constructed cubed junk towers and pyramids. During his eons-long existence he has accrued enough sentience to collect discarded items like a packrat, watch a time-worn ""Hello Dolly"" videocassette (what, no DVD?)and to befriend the only living thing left, a surprisingly appealing cockroach (although given their legendary durability, WALL-ET should have had thousands of cockroach friends).The first, rough third of the movie silently records WALL-ET's bleak daily grind. The second third of the movie depicts WALL-ET's encounter with a ""feminine"" robotic scout from a reconnaissance ship. Named EVE, her job is to scan Earth for any signs of vegetative life. At first, WALL-ET and EVE's encounters and courtship are tentative and perilous, as EVE basically regards WALL-ET as a hostile enemy good only for target practice and WALL-ET timorously tries to make friends with her. EVE eventually warms up to WALL-ET when he shows her a plant he has transferred to an old shoe (for me, this was a poignant moment that asserted that life will always find a way no matter what). She appropriates the plant to take back to the mothership, the Axiom, for analysis. Upon analysis, the Axiom will determine that it is time to return home with its cargo of dispossessed human passengers.So, for the first two-thirds of the movie I was quietly charmed by stark, photorealistic scenery and themes of loneliness, abandonment, making contact, human profligacy, and corporate greed (Buy & Large being the corporate villain - clever name! By and Large, buy and enlarge, get it?) Pixar is our ""American anime"" with its meticulous rendition of mechanical, non-organic, and non-human characters. However, in the third and final act, when WALL-ET follows his new friend EVE to the Axiom, that same ""American anime"" showcases the same weakness as its Japanese counterpart - goofy-looking, grotesque humanoids.The Axiom resembles an ultra-modern space cruise ship that caters to everyone's need. However, the passengers have been at space so long (700 years) that they have regressed into flabby beanbags with appendages. They need hoverchairs to get around. WALL-ET encounters both mechanical and human obstacles on his way to meet EVE again, and the overall chase is fun. Yet, the problem I found with the movie at this point is that although nominally the hero, WALL-ET, for all his appeal and pluck, is eclipsed by EVE and the Axiom's captain, just as Bilbo Baggins was eclipsed by more colorful characters in ""The Hobbit"". The captain's struggles against his ship's computer AUTO (which for some unexplained reason wishes to keep the Axiom cruising indefinitely), and his own physical inertia, take precedence over WALL-ET's quest. Even when our little reluctant hero sacrifices himself to save the Axiom a la ET, he is still eclipsed. Of course, EVE saves him with the spare parts WALL-ET has amassed on Earth, and the captain manages to bring the passengers back to Earth for recolonization. Uplifting as this ending is, it seemed too pat and abrupt for me.Nevertheless, ""WALL-ET"" is much more than a sensationalistic thrill ride and the adventures of the obligatory cute robot seeking companionship. It is also an ultimately somber and disconcerting testimony to conspicuous excess and wretched consumption, which it took a dedicated trash compactor to point out."	4.0	WALL-ET, it's time to go back home!	2010-08-27	1	0	1

When a movie says it's for ""the family"" it usually means it's for kids and they throw in a few jokes only adults will get so they won't lose their freaking minds when they're sitting through it with their 5-year-old. Those movies don't hold my attention.So please understand how significant it is that this one very much did.It is not a movie FOR kids. Don't get me wrong. Kids will love it because it has cute little robots throughout, and nothing even remotely offensive. However the plot is not about cartoon cars getting ready for the big race or moving, talking toys. (nothing wrong with that, just not as much my cup of tea) And that is where the genius lies. The plot deals with humans who are becoming more and more lazy, trashing our planet, things that are actually happening. Things that are not only entertaining in this context, but are important. It is not only an interesting concept with (REALLY) amazing animation and a robot love story. It takes humanity and looks into an almost science-fiction, but yet unfortunately a not too terribly unbelievable journey hundreds of years into our future. It's a rare occasion, and possibly the first for an animated film, to not just be a great movie. But to be an important one. And I believe Wall-e has accomplished that.This is a classic movie any way you slice it. It may be difficult for some to endure with its lack of dialogue. But once it gets rolling, it will keep your attention and make you think about us as a human race, not to mention keep a smile on your face the whole time.

Thiel"""	I rented WALL*E because it looked like a fun bit of comedy and with well done animation--and it's all that as well--but ended up absolutely amazed at how meaningful and significant the story is.No spoilers here, but at first I thought it was about a robot that, because he is a complex system and had been left running indefinitely, had developed human-like intelligence and personality, but as the movie progressed I found this increadibly deep story to be more on the level of social satire or philosophy.Though I'm tempted to say more about the 'life' of the robots versus the humans at this point, as promised, I will not spoil it since I enjoyed the unfolding of the details while watching it for the first time.I'm not saying this because I'm an overeducated geek who looks for deep meaning where there is none; in fact I rented this film just for good old fashion dumb entertainment; but I wouldn't be writing one of my few-and-far-between movie reviews if I didn't think the film was brilliant.There's just enough actual dialogue to keep it from becoming some kind of esoteric film, and yet kids and girlfriends alike will love it because the story is romantic and cute.BOTTOM LINE: Both graphically and in terms of story line, WALL*E is elegant without having gone off the deep end so that you no longer feel like you're watching an animated comedy feature but being schooled instead.  This is neither a graphic masterpiece or something that will be up for a Nobel Prize, but if you want to expose both yourself and your children to something both entertaining and thought provoking, this is an excellent choice.Again, I was absolutely shocked at how great and deeply meaningful this film turned out to be, and I'll be purchasing it for my collection so I can watch it over and over again.	5.0	A deeply thoughtful and meaningful story.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3F9VH8916IA40	Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...	Pixar has come of age my friends.Pixar has never made a bad movie, in fact I'd consider almost all of them to be a masterpiece, but none of them, before now, have tried to be anything more then emotional family affairs, not that there is anything wrong with that, but they weren't necessarily deep, meaningful beyond personal issues, or revealed anything about our society. Now, I say again, there isn't anything wrong with that, but Wall-E goes beyondsimple family entertainment and becomes Pixar's statement to the world. But Pixar doesn't go Hollywood by bashing its viewers over the head with its ecological message, instead it tells the tale of a species that has lost its way; a people who have allowed themselves to fall into the deception and complacency of a consumer society gone mad. It explores a world where humans can hardly live up to the name, and where man made machines show more emotion, love, and tenderness then do their creators.Eight hundred years in the future Earth is a deserted wasteland. In the year 2110 the planet has undergone a transformation and the once proud civilization which dotted the landscape has literally been reduced to a pile of heaping garbage. Poisonous fumes covered the globe, the plant life died, and all forms of animal life except, of course, roaches perished. But we don't get to see all that, all we see are the devastating effects of the disaster. The bleakness of the landscape will most likely be lost on smaller viewers who will be more then happy to focus on the quirky characters, who I will talk about in a moment, but for adult viewers seeing sky scrapers built entirely of garbage piercing the skyline will send chills down the spine. There really is nothing left of our planet, except of course for Wall-E.Back in 2110 the human race, unwilling to deal with the huge problem that faced them, decided instead to flee the planet and ignore the mess they'd created, leaving behind an army of robots known as Wall-E's to clean up the mess and make the planet habitable again. Unfortunately the task was far too great for the robot army, and as time went by these robots broke down until there is only one left who continues in a hopeless attempt to clean the planet; this last robot we know only as Wall-E, the last of his kind. Human beings have not returned, and yet this little robot continues to clean up our mess.During the day Wall-E spends his time collecting garbage and turning it into small garbage cubes, which he then stacks on top of one another, eventually building tall skyscrapers out of these blocks. When his shift ends however he spends his time collecting trinkets left behind, VHS tapes, jewelry, light bulbs, and things of that nature. He also cares for a pet roach that follows him around everywhere he goes. His routine is broken however when, one day, a spaceship lands carrying on it another robot, EVE, who's mission it is to seek out life on earth. Make a long story short; they fall in love, eventfully leading to Wall-E and EVE returning to the human mother ship, where the human race has been surviving for the last 700 years.It is here that the film makes yet another statement on our society as it exists today. At first there is no sign of human life aboard, the halls are filled with robot activity, but the humans are pretty hard to miss. Gliding around on hover seats, drooling away at heads up computer screens, humanity has become little more then one large lazy mass of blubber, thoughtlessly sipping from super sized drinks and buying products from the ships shopping malls. With machines taking care of every human desire, the need to get up and walk has been taken care of years ago, and so people are content to live their lives slaves to their robot masters, as long as they are kept happy and content. It is a miserable existence, and yet it is all they've ever known.Apart from the strong, but not overly so, messages contained in this film, this is still Pixar, and with that comes a strong emotional story that will make children laugh and adults wipe their eyes. The relationship Wall-E and EVE share evolves and develops as the film goes on, moving from distrust, to mutual friendship, to something of an older sister younger brother relationship, to a romance, all done without any words spoken between the two apart from their names. Wall-E is probably Pixar's most feel good and touching story since Finding Nemo, and for all those Nemo fans out there you that's saying a lot. The characters do nothing but beep at one anther, much like R2-D2 from Star Wars, and yet their story is told more fully then most films. When a film can make you care deeply for characters who don't say a word you know its a good one.Like always the art in this film is amazing. Pixar only gets better and better as time goes by, while other computer animated studios slip farther and farther away.  Its simply breathtaking, but what else to you expect from the masters of computer animation?Wall-E takes Pixar out of the world of simply family entertainment and puts this studio in the same league as famed Japanese studio, Studio Ghibli, who's films (Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind,Princess Mononoke) carry ecological themes as well as being great fun. Wall-E is art of a high level, and transcends the computer animated genera. Its simply a great film.Replay Value; VERY high.SPOILER.Watch at the end of the film when Wall-E is put back together by EVE and doesn't seem to remember her. Many philosophers in the past have wondered are we merely the sum of our parts, or are we something more then that? If our body parts were to be replaced and our hard drive, our memories if you will, were wiped clean, would we still be the same person? It's great for a studio like Pixar to explore these questions and at least bring them to their audience's minds. Again, this will be lost on children, but Pixar films are for adults too you know.	5.0	Quite possibly Pixars best film	2008-06-27	13	10	3

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2KXQ1CIU9B8Z2	JR	What is so brilliant about WALL-E is simple: For the first hour or so you don't even realize you are watching a silent film. Beyond the musicians on WALL-E's TV, or the advertisments being broadcast from before Earth's fall into ruin, there is no dialouge. That makes it all the more enticing to watch as WALL-E makes his way through the earth that is now wasteland, showing all those incredible human emotions that we are selves are in touch with everyday, but probably don't hold neary as dear as the protaginist in this film.Without going into all the breakdowns of the film and all the incredible praised it has well earned, for those who are looking for excellent films to test their hardware on, WALL-E is one of them.  The colors in this film are vibrant, bold and beautiful, and with the right hardware it is an absolute treat to behold.  A great upscaling DVD or excellent blu ray player can bring this film to life the way it was meant to be, outside of the movie theater experience.It is also an excellent test for your music system, as the sounds are bold an subtle at the same time and a great workout for your audio system. That, and the Dark Knight are my two test dvd's when it comes to testing audio and visual.Beyond this enjoy and savor this film if you are coming to it for the first time.

I would look closely at certain shots like at the beginning with Wall E at Earth cleaning up b/c its far by the best looking garbage I have seen.The 1st time I watched it with my three and a half year old and my twenty month old and they watched about the 1st thirty minutes and they were done never to look at it again.  They simply did not care for this movie and I think they enjoyed the beginning b/c the music and whats going on plays together and Wall E has a certain silliness at the beginning.  That is kind of where my three stars come from since my kids really didn't enjoy it that much and neither did I.  I would say it was cute but not great.  I would say rent it just to see it on blu ray and who knows maybe your kids will like it.As I watched it I am pretty sure there are a few political themes in the movie as well as parts that I said ""hey that might offend sensitive people"" not me though b/c I really didn't care.  That kind of stuff doesn't bother me but I found myself wondering why humans would create robots that would have emotional responses to each other than again I could be thinking to much since this is a kids movie.I did like hearing the robots speak though and Wall E had that funny kind of stuff like you would see a kid do like put a bra on their face since they don't know what its for.The emotional response of the robots was conveyed pretty good simply by their eye work.I guess this movie is good as long as you don't think about everything too much like me since it is a kids movie.I meant to give this movie 3 stars and I went back to fix it from the 5 but I can't so thats my explanation."	5.0	O.K.	2008-12-06	5	1	4

The magic in the movie is in the music & visuals. Your eyes will have tears in check but borderline as you watch the story progress. For Mac users, you'll enjoy when Wall*E recharges.

The film plays out like a Chaplin movie (Gold Rush) as in the lovable loser falls for the cold and distant person,this case a robot and eventually the love is reciprocated, yeah it's like that, but crossed with 200l: A Space Odyssey.

Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.

My daughter loved the love story and the animation and my wife and I could reflect on how humanity is losing its, um, humanity via the electronic revolution and the dependency / convenience it provides.  A snarky dude such as myself would point out the electronic revolution is what made the technology which brought this beautifully computer-animated flick to life aaaaand unrestrained consumerism provided the $$$.  After uttering this remark my wife would simply look at me (with The Look, come on married guys, you know what I mean) and then say, ""Shut up.""  We have watched this movie at least 25 times and we are likely to watch it at least 25 more times.What I loved:1.  True love story between Wall-E and EVE beautifully (both sentimentally and cinematically) unfolded with minimal dialog (words were so very unnecessary - I enjoyed the silence)2.  CGI MAGIC, some of the most breath-taking scenes of any movie, expertly rendered and masterfully woven together - achieved ""true art"" status3.  Encapsulated message about standing up for what's right and robotic love leaves you wondering how a pile of computer chips could become so very very humanWhat I did NOT like:1.  At times I didn't know if I was at a kids movie or simply getting lectured by an environmental group / anti-big-box store documentary which pulled me out of the movie long enough to contemplate the hypocrisy of the on-screen preaching / off screen merchandising... how many plastic Wall-E related toys are sitting in landfills RIGHT NOW... hmmm2.  Abandoned apocalyptic world might be too scary for younger viewers and could spark difficult conversation with children about American consumer culture while buying ANYTHING at ANY STORE, ANYWHERE (No little Jimmy, not every store is a huge BnL store which is going to put us all off-planet to live in complete comfort and luxury)3.  Director Andrew Stanton's ""behind the scenes"" muffled attempt at interjecting Biblical themes which are so off the mark and uninteresting that most people wouldn't catch them and at least 16% of the US population (and most of Europe) would simply roll their eyesHey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A28GCEHD00JFZG	Julian Kennedy	Wall-E: 8 out of 10: I was never a big fan of the Short Circuit movies. It was not just the thespian outings of Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg I had issues with; I also hated the freakin robot. In addition, while I have admired some Pixar releases in the past (The Incredibles in particular), I am hardly the biggest fan of the studio and often admire some of their competition (such as DreamWorks' Shrek) more.Therefore, I did not go into Wall-E with very high hopes. Had I known it featured the music of Hello Dolly I may never have seen it at all. After the first twenty minutes, I was blown away.I will let other reviewers explain the Chaplin style magic of the piece. Suffice it to say wow. When the movie settles into somewhat of a plot it does bog down slightly (There are at least one to many scenes of robots we do not care about chasing other robots we do not care about) but in reality it is simply a different magic.Emotionally satisfying and wonderfully subversive Wall-E is necessary viewing for adults. I am not sure if it necessarily a good film for young people with poor attention spans, but thoughtful kids will get much out of it.Moreover, kudos to Pixar for making one of the most individualistic anti-commercial films I have ever seen.	5.0	Wall-E....

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A10G4BPT5MGBHY	Julie Neal	"I am floored. I didn't think it was possible for Pixar to surpassToy Story, but it has. A sophisticated treat for adults and teens, a cuddly romance for the juice-box set, this comedic science fiction thriller romance (really!) takes the company to a new, more mature level. Filled with artistry, depth, meaning and a lot of humor, WALL-E is a masterpiece. WhereCarswas a kid's movie with added adult themes, this is an adult movie with added value for children.DIALOGUE SCHMIALOGUEBefore I saw WALL-E I had read about the lack of dialogue, and how it might be a risky move for Pixar to make a film with characters that don't talk in a traditional sense. Well, trash that. The most emotionally powerful scenes in this movie are those with the LEAST dialogue. Fully developed and indeed almost human, the two main characters are Wall-E himself (the letters stand for Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth Class; there's also a WALL-A) and EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), two machines in love.After about a half hour I was wondering if Pixar could continue to pull off this less-is-more concept for the rest of the film -- then the two robots started playing Pong! Such imaginative screenplay carries the film to what should be a Best Picture nomination. Seriously.A TOUCHING STORYWALL-E is a lonely little robotic trash compactor who was left behind after Earth was abandoned some 700 years earlier. He has been methodically cleaning up the trash-ridden planet ever since, and harboring a tiny plant he has found among the garbage. Eve, meanwhile, lives on the immense spaceship Axiom, which is also home to the fat, blob-like remains of the human race. She is a probe robot that flies to Earth to determine if the planet is ready for habitation. WALL-E takes one look at the streamlined, angelic Eve and falls in love.It didn't take long for me to fall in love with the little robot. As soon as he giggled (after his pet cockroach tickled him) I was hooked. This hardworking rusty guy with his small home full of collected treasures is so poignant. His lonely life is so human. Eve is just as likable, but much more sleek. Near the end comes a heartbreaking moment when a key character seems to lose all personality, all self. So well done, it made me think of how families must feel when a loved one disappears inside him- or herself with Alzheimer's disease.All ends well, of course. As the credits roll, the artwork illustrates how everyone and everything lives happily after ever.AN ADULT MEANINGFor adults, WALL-E is not so much about a cute little robot as it is about the future of man. What happens when humans become such creatures of the consumer culture, so fat they can't even stand up without assistance, living literally on auto-pilot, that they do nothing but buy cheap merchandise, stuff their faces at the Regurgitated Food Buffet and lie around watching video screens? Can they ever get back to the land and set their souls free? Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young asked that question decades ago; Pixar asks it today.There is even a sly political reference. Broadcasting a message to the passengers of the spaceship, the CEO of monster corporation Buy 'n' Large -- played in live-action by the inimitable Fred Willard, and named Shelby Forthright -- says they will be continuing on their never-ending, hopeless cruise to nowhere because they must ""Stay the course!"" Hmmm, haven't I heard a president use that line?EXTRA TOUCHESWALL-E has so many wonderful touches! After the little robot is charged using his solar panels, he ""turns on"" with a sound any Macintosh owner will recognize. The robot's collected objects, much like the thingamabobs ofThe Little Mermaid's Ariel, are things that are uniquely human: bubble wrap, an iPod, a Rubics cube, a singing plastic trophy fish and -- blink and you'll miss it -- a carrousel horse from Walt Disney World. Especially inspired are the two things on this future Earth that are totally indestructible: a cockroach and Twinkies.Stay for the credits. Recalling cave drawings, hieroglyphics, Monet and Van Gogh paintings and early computer graphics, the progressive sequence of art within them sneaks in the history of dialogue-free storytelling.ANIMATED? REALLY?The look of the movie is hard to describe. In one scene, when WALL-E and EVE are investigating a piece of bubble wrap, you can't tell it is an animated film. It actually appears to be live-action. Likewise, the outer space scenes have the same level of realism as any of theStar Warsmovies. The trailing tower of squiggly smoke that's left behind by a launching spacecraft re-creates the Florida sky of a Space Shuttle launch to a T. For the most part, it is only when humans are portrayed that you are consciously aware that what you're watching was generated on circuit boards, not in cameras.I've seen the movie three times, first in digital projection and then from a film projector. The digital showing was much sharper, which made all the realistic touches far easier to appreciate.MOVIE REFERENCESIt's obvious the Pixar folks are movie lovers; there are so many cinematic inspirations in WALL-E that I lost count. The ""Put On Your Sunday Clothes"" sequence fromHello, Dolly!shows up -- literally -- maybe half a dozen times. (Disney World fans may also remember the song as one of the background melodies along Main Street U.S.A.) The Axiom spaceship's computer is clearly an homage to HAL from2001: A Space Odyssey; that film's signature overture ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" plays at a key moment. WALL-E himself combines the purrs ofE.T., the attitude of R2-D2 and the moves of Charlie Chaplin. There's a brief reference toTitanic.OPENING CARTOONThe movie is preceded by a Pixar short, ""Presto,"" that had the entire audience I was sitting with in stitches. Its plot: When a magician neglects to feed his bunny a carrot, an escalating disaster results. It's so nice to start a feature with a cartoon. I wish other studios still did it. (Disney fans will note the magician's hat is similar to the one used by Mickey Mouse inFantasia.)Will it ever run out? This continuous font of imagination from Pixar? With WALL-E, it sure doesn't look like it.-- By Julie Neal, author ofThe Complete Walt Disney World 2010."	5.0	A masterpiece	2008-06-26	533	472	61

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A26X2TG93OTXVU	Justin Heath	"Though there have been some exceptional movies so far this year there but there have been few which I would call a classic. With WALL-E, things have just changed. WALL-E isn't only the best film of 2008 so far, it is a pure masterpiece. From start to finish, the film wraps you in utterly delightful charm and humanity. WALL-E is a piece of inventive beauty and wonder unlike any other that you will see at the cinema this summer. I absolutely guarantee it.WALL-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is the last operating robot on Earth. As for the human race, they left 700 years ago, when the huge amounts of self-produced trash caught up with them. WALL-E's task is to clean up the planet for the return of the humans. However, after being left on his own for so long, WALL-E has developed a personality. He is curious about many of the items that he finds whilst compacting trash, such as an old tape of the musical ""Hello Dolly!"" But he is also becoming lonely, which is understandable for someone who only has a friendly cockroach for company.However, all of this changes with the arrival of EVE (voiced by Elissa Knight). Thought EVE is initially hostile towards WALL-E, this doesn't stop him from becoming smitten with her and trying to connect with her. However, EVE has come to Earth on a classified mission. Once that mission has been completed, EVE shuts down and waits to be taken back from whence she came. When her transport arrives, WALL-E can't bear to lose his friend and sneaks aboard. His search for EVE brings him into contact with the remainder of the human race, who have been taking refuge on a huge spaceship and who have become excessively reliable on machines to supply their every need. They don't even walk. However, WALL-E's arrival sets many events in motion which may help the human race to return to normality...First of all, WALL-E's animation is flawless. However, as with the rest of the film, there is also a sense of risk and bravery which adds extra dimensions to the glorious animation. The first moments in the film, which show us the beauty of the stars before swooping down to gaze upon a barren and deserted Earth, are so detailed and emotionally engaging that you are immediately sucked into the tale without any hesitation. Even when the story becomes more traditional (that is in no way an attack on the film), the creativity and power of the film's visuals never falter.The main focus of the plot is on the growing affection between WALL-E and EVE. This is one of the most moving romantic relationships in years. No, they're not even human. But watching the initial conflict of EVE's determination and WALL-E's innocence slowly mix into love and companionship is magnificent. The scenes between the two characters on Earth are simply wonderful, perfectly paced and confident in the set-up of this unusual couple. However, the best scene comes in the second half, when WALL-E and EVE dance through space together. Everything in this scene is perfect, the comedy of watching WALL-E propel himself through space by use of a fire extinguisher, the lovely visuals, Thomas Newman's marvelous score and the interaction between the two characters. When WALL-E looks likely to float off into space after the fire extinguisher runs out, EVE flies in and scoops him up in her arms. This scene is pure cinematic genius. Overall, there is a humanity and grace of execution in the relationship between WALL-E and EVE which elevates it far beyond the emotional impact of other romantic relationships.The term of ""cinematic genius"" can also be applied to the iconic character of WALL-E and the fantastic direction by Finding Nemo director Andrew Staunton. Staunton shows that he is willing to inject some risk into his movie-making if it makes a better film. This decision pays off magnificently here. Staunton has lovingly constructed this film with invention, depth and bravura, and in doing so has crafted a piece of movie making which is likely to go down as at least a family classic. Not only will children be enthralled by the sheer brilliance of this film, but other audiences will also be open to its bewitching magic.As for WALL-E himself, he is one of the most original movie creations in years. Speaking in sequences of robotic speech (bleeps, whirs, etc.) with only small moments of mechanical dialogue, the filmmakers have still managed to create one of the most human characters of the year. By mostly using his eyes, the animators are able to flawlessly display WALL-E's emotions. In one scene, his eyes droop with sadness when EVE calls him Wally. When he panics or is happy, his eyes rise in an outburst of emotion. The life that the filmmakers are able to find in such simple mannerisms is incredible. Even the beeps and whirs, provided masterfully by legendary sound designer Ben Burtt, increase an already rich and lovable character to terrific heights. The character of WALL-E is just superb, as is the rest of the movie.WALL-E has just raised the bar for future animated movies. Pixar Animation Studios has already crafted many animated classics. WALL-E joins them without question. The visuals are compelling, the characters are endlessly endearing and the story is told with beauty, wit, imagination and humanity. I couldn't have asked for more."	5.0	An Imaginative and Heartfelt Masterpiece	2008-10-11	107	94	13

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AVLW8Y8D3WJLT	"Justin Ordonez ""foodmart"""	It's almost useless to rally against this movie, but its rather gross in its portrayal of obese people.  It also incorrectly links obese people to environmental problems.  As was displayed by many newspapers, it is not fat people who pollute, but thin and wealthy people.  Most overweight people are middle class, with the majority of poverty level being overweight.  These people create the least amount of waste in our society.  They own less cars, less property, less stuff and pollute less.Children are unable to understand such nuance and will think be given the message that fat people are to blame for what is the fault of all humanity.If Disney wanted to make a social commentary, they should have created a movie about an overweight family living below the poverty line whose overweight because the only food affordable to them is low nutrition, high fat, chemically packed food.  It would have at least been a social commentary on a problem that's actually real.	1.0	Worst Pixar Movie Ever	2008-10-30	128	18	110

Any movie that captivates my 3 year old, enchants my 11 year old, and entertains my husband and me is a rare and real triumph.  WALL-E is without question one of the best family films of the year to date.Pixar has outdone themselves with this film.  The animation is truly lovely; the story is sweet and touching; the characters are vivid, engaging, and very believable; and the soundtrack is superb.  I start laughing out loud the moment I heard the first notes from the songs of Hello, Dolly (much to the chagrin of my 11 year old), and the giggles continued on for the rest of the film.  Basing the entire plot on two songs from a well-loved movie musical was a bold and brilliant move by the creators of this film, and the idea certainly caught my fancy.  As an added bonus, the tribute to the HAL 9000 and the accompanying 2001 underscore had me rolling in the aisles.  Very clever!The story of WALL-E is told in great depth and detail with very minimal dialog.  Using beeps, gestures, and yes, even expressions, this charming robotic romance comes to life before our eyes.  Who needs words?  My three year old certainly did not.  This was her first adventure to the movie theater, and I was a bit concerned that the lack of dialog would be an issue, but she was absolutely enthralled.  When EVE finally started to respond to WALL-E, she whispered to me ""Look, Mommy, they're friends now.""  When EVE ""got sick"" (my daughter's words), she told me ""Mommy, WALL-E is taking care of EVE.""  Later in the film, she cried out ""EVE, EVE, you have to save WALL-E.""  She really got it, every bit.Now, I do have to say that ""save the earth from the ravages of evil mankind"" propaganda really has no place in a children's movie (and thus it loses a star), but fortunately it only minimally detracts from the robots' touching love story and their ""directive"" to save humanity and return them to Earth.  WALL-E is a cute, funny, romantic film, just right for the entire family.  Highly recommended."	4.0	Captured the Heart of My Entire Family	2008-07-06	9	6	3

I remember loving disney movies as a child and now i can love them as a young adult because of movies like this.The Beginning Shows a Very cute little robot doing what he was Intended for, cleaning our garbage consumed planet. as the movie goes on you come to see WALL-E is the only Robot that has survived and has adapted a very smart intelect. The simplicity of his innocence is prominent throughout the entire movie. HIs best friend is a cockaroach and he lives in an old machine that is decorated with his personality. Lights, Toys and various memrobelia that he himself finds simple when in reaity are some of the most history changing things like rubics cubes and video games.A look into his daily routine shows he is just like the rest of us, wakes up sleepy and gets ready for the day. which is absolutly adorable.The graphics are a 10, stunning color and animation steal he show. The movie also has a bigger meaning. Like taking care of our planet, eating healthy and going back to our roots as people before fast food and takeout existed.WALL-E is an amazin movie for kids and adults of all kind and touches a spot on your heart that no other disney movie has ever achived.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3FY3H6F4249E0	Kathy W	I couldn't wait to see Wall.e at the theater and I was very disappointed. I am sorry to say that, in my opinion, it was just not a very good movie. The robots were cute but the story line really sucked. The scenario happens in the future and people have made so much trash that Manhattan is literally a trash dump, as is the rest of earth. The people who were left were transported to a space station where they have been living for the last 700 years. They do nothing but lay on lounge chairs and are transported around all day.  They even drink their food in shakes, so they don't even have to chew. They are all weight-callenged (like maybe 500 lbs). If they fall off the lounge chair a robot has to pick them up because their muscles have all atrophied and they cannot get up or walk. Their feet and legs are swollen and their feet look like little balloons. Obviously, there are health and environmental messages here, and I guess that was the intent of the flick. I think the movie was trying to say that if we don't wake up, this is what will happen.Apparently periodic surveilance is done by sending a robot to Earth to look for evidence of plant life.  Finally, the visiting robot found a plant on earth.  That means the earth is now capable of sustaining life again and the people can return home. I like the attempt at the health and environmental issues but the movie is slow and boringly done. I almost fell asleep twice, which is pretty unusual for me, especially on an empty stomach. Two thumbs down on this review, I am sorry to say, because I love Disney and the Pixar movies.  Wall.e stands for Waste Allocation something and he is an adorable trash compactor.  He is self-contained with the personality of an adorable and lonely little child and he reminds you of the Short Circuit robot of previous movies.  The visiting robot is Eva, so you can guess that Wall.e gets the robot-hots for her.  The movie is safe for your young children to see. I just think that Disney could have done so much more with the story-line.	3.0	A big disappointment	2008-08-04	24	3	21
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1AKQ1YUS4BT82	"Katie Babs ""Katiebabs"""	My favorite Disney Pixar movie of all time is Toy Story and now I can say that it is WALL*E. If you enjoy the Pixar movies, you will love this movie. Even if you aren't a fan of animation, I whole heartily recommend you go see WALL*E. As an adult I was taught a lesson. When a child and adult can leave a movie together and talk about the same things they watched and ask questions, that is really an amazing thing.Synopsis: What if mankind had to leave Earth, and somebody forgot to turn the last robot off? After hundreds of lonely years of doing what he was built for, WALL*E (short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) discovers a new purpose in life (besides collecting knick-knacks) when he meets a sleek search robot named EVE. EVE comes to realize that WALL*E has inadvertently stumbled upon the key to the planet's future, and races back to space to report her findings to the humans (who have been eagerly awaiting word that it is safe to return home). Meanwhile, WALL*E chases EVE across the galaxy and sets an adventure into motion. Joining WALL*E on his journey across the universe is a cast of characters including a pet cockroach and a heroic team of malfunctioning misfit robots.The first few minutes of WALL*E are a bit depressing. Earth is a vast wasteland of garbage. And when I say wasteland, I mean that in the literal sense. Humans have left Earth because of the output of garbage, waste and abuse to the environment. The year is 2775 and all that remains are skyscrapers, filth and waste. As I sat there, the six year turns to me and asks what has happened to the Earth? Why all the garbage? I honestly have no answer for him and as he turns back to look at the screen he says, garbage is very bad. Things become a bit lighter as we see WALL*E on the screen. The character of WALL*E is so very much like a child. He sees things as a child would. Even though his job is to clean up the garbage the best he can, he likes to collect things such as Rubik Cubes, light bulbs and utensils. WALL*E has such an incredible personality that shows he is not just a mindless robot. He enjoys watching an old time 1950's musical and loves the music and the dancing. He especially enjoys watching one scene over and over again where a man and woman are holding hands and sing to each other. WALL*E assumes love means holding hands; but he has no one to hold hands with.EVE comes down to Earth with a directive in mind. She reminded me of a mutant egg, but quickly just as WALL*E tugged at my heart, EVE will do the same with you. WALL*E welcomes her with open arms, so very happy he has another to share his toys with. He assumes she will want to stay with him and perhaps she will be the one to finally hold his hand. (The hand holding becomes very important throughout the movie) But WALL*E has in his possession what EVE is searching for. WALL*E has found a small plant growing out of all the waste and gives it to EVE. By plant life beginning to grown on Earth again after hundreds of years, that means humans can return to their home and begin a new.EVE is taken back to her ship and WALL*E follows her because he thinks she is in danger. EVE is sent back to a huge giant like cruise spaceship where humans live as if they are on permanent vacation. Another disturbing fact is that because robots do everything for humans, humans have become big lazy blobs who ride around in chairs as they drink fatting shakes and watching TV very oblivious to life around them. When the Captain of the ship receives the plant, it means they can return home to Earth. But his co-pilot, which is a robot and so very much like HAL from the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey has specific instructions that humans can not return to Earth. It takes over the ship's controls and tries to stop WALL*E and EVE from placing the plant in a certain part of the ship that will enable them to go back to Earth.So many lessons were taught and learned in this simple animated movie. It is heartbreaking to think in hundreds of years, Earth may no longer be inhabitable by living things and we would have to leave to travel in space with no meaning. WALL*E in some ways is very much like 2001: A Space Odyssey and as an adult I laughed at so many hidden jokes that came straight from the movie. But like 2001, there is hope and in WALL*E even though things look hopeless, that is not the case. Even though Earth is devastated, things can change. By the end of WALL*E my depression that I felt at the beginning of the movie became a feeling of hope. You must stay till the very end and watch the closing credits because as Peter Gabriel sings, we see through very amateur drawings how humans can make Earth so very green again because of a robot who should have no feelings or personality was able to deliver one small plant that will become the roots for a future of hope.Katiebabs	5.0	Amazing and Adorable Movie!

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AWJO77QSUI1FQ	K. Calloway	"I'm ashamed of myself for dissing Pixar like this, and I really tried to convince myself after the movie that it wasn't that bad...but I finally admit it...I am really disappointed. Ever since Toy Story I have been a huge Pixar fan and have yet to be let down by them until now with WALL-E.I will get the good points out of the way now because they're obvious: superb animation, shots, and direction, and I really appreciated the lack of dialog and the focus on non-verbal communication throughout most of this movie; it all helped tell the story of the Earth being left behind by humanity for clean-up by robots. However, what really sinks WALL-E is the introduction of the human characters and the confusingly poor choice by the director to combine live actors with clearly cartoon animated ""actors"". This really did not work. Not to mention having Fred Willard as one of the main human characters; his funky humor worked well in Best In Show, but it was totally out-of-place here. As well, the development of the animated characters was sub-par and too cartoonish; they came off as unfinished to me.The other disappointing and at times annoying part of WALL-E is the overtly political and environmental tone it attempts to take on yet fails miserably. WALL-E tries to make a case for being less greedy and materialistic, and more green and caring for the Earth (how trendy). While I agree whole-heartedly with this sentiment, I felt the argument presented by WALL-E was like that of a rebellious teenager who doesn't quite know what they're fighting against but uses their emotional angst to push their point over on the world around them with little impact other than to make themselves appear naive and in vain. WALL-E came off as pushy and childish in this respect, not to mention unbelievable in its ""vision"" of the future should humanity continue on its mass-consumeristic course.In closing, maybe I was expecting too much from Pixar with WALL-E. I mean, the majority of reviews (critics and readers alike) as evidenced by Metacritic.com, are overwhelmingly great. Not to mention Pixar's track record thus far. I can't help but feel perplexed at how well this movie has been received and just what it was that I missed."	3.0	I'm ashamed of myself...	2008-09-15	27	11	16

Movies put out which seem to only promote a social or economic or other specific agenda are movies I can't like.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A144I2VJ9T0N26	Keith Zabalaoui	"This movie is an instant classic, as long as you ignore the subtext. Americans have destroyed the earth by consuming far more than they need. (I say Americans because that's all we ever see.) They have abandoned the planet and are living in a giant cruise ship in the sky where they are so fat that they can't get off their floating chairs. They are constantly on the phone and waited on hand and foot, literally, by a servile race of robots. Their leader is ignorant of reality and relies on the computer to educate him. The only real human we see is Fred Willard who plays the president of the USA, who seems to also be the CEO of the only company left, ""Buy N Large."" Fred leaves messages saying the Earth will recover, then that it won't and that we should ""stay the course."" In the end, it is left to the now child-like humans on the ship to go back and revive the planet.This sort of thing bugs the holy who-ha out of me. I don't want to go to a kid's show to be preached to and I certainly don't want Disney or anyone else sneaking ""American's Bad"" or even ""Human's Bad"" messages into these films.Putting that aside, if you can, you get a very well-crafted story about robots in love. But its more than that. There is a lot of symbolism that doesn't preach. We have a single, forgotten, beat up trashbot - a sort of everyman of robots - falling for the svelt uberbot. He's got high hopes and follows his dream.Another remarkable aspect of the show is the lack of dialog. They are able to get the story across without it, through action and upgraded R2D2-speak. It's very effective.Overall, the movie is very enjoyable. If you don't mind the subtext or if you agree with it, then you'll probably love this movie. If, like me, you want it left in a documentary and wonder why this film has to take a jab at Bush (""stay the course"") when its supposed to be about two cuddly robots, then you probably won't like it as much."	3.0	A Tail of Two WALL-Es	2008-07-10	16	6	10

Considering this is a Disney product, I'm VERY disappointed.  This is my second Wall-E DVD failed at the exact same parts and I've tried it on many DVD players.  Other reviewers I've read tried buying this DVD from other retailers (both big and small) and experienced the same thing.  So, it's not an Amazon thing, it's an issue with the ""quality control"" from whoever produced the DVDs.There are some people that misconstrew the review.  I want to make it crystal clear.  People don't read the reviews of ""Special Edition"" DVDs to determine if the movie is any good.  They already know that.  People read a review of a ""Special Edition"" DVD to determine if it is worth buying the Special Edition.  The answer is a resounding NO.  This is not just coming from me but from other buyers.  This set is defective and Disney has acknowledged as such.  Anyone giving a 5-star review of a DVD that you can't watch because the DVD is defective is doing a serious disservice to other buyers.  It doesn't matter how great a movie is.  If you can't watch the movie on the DVD discs, then it is not a 5-star product, even if it is a 5-star movie.Trying to replace the defective DVD is also a headache.  There's a number you can call (I posted it as a comment to another review) to get a replacement for the DVD.  They still ask you a ton of questions and pretend they don't know what you're talking about until they reluctantly agree to ship you a replacement DVD from the One-Disc version.  Do yourself a HUGE favor and avoid the headache.  Just buy the single DVD version.How ironic is it that a movie that is all about recycling and not producing waste has DVDs that are defective that will in all likelihood end up in a landfill?"	1.0	Got TWO defective DVDs and apparently others got defective DVDs, too!	2009-05-03	24	13	11

They have come up with some of the most innovative ideas for movies in the last ten plus years. Some of their hits have been absolute masterpieces, Toy Story, Monsters.Inc and The Incredibles just to name a few. The problem with their last few movies, Walle and Ratatoille especially is that while they are innovative, the graphics are beautiful, the story line and plot are unique and interesting THEY ARE NO LONGER FUN.I found it a little insulting in Walle to see all the humans who are all fat and lazy and depend on the robots to do everything for them. Heck they couldn't even walk.... that is insulting.I thought the movie was okay but way to preachy but my main complaint is the fun. You know a kids movie is a little dull when all the kids in the audience, including mine, are asking ""when is this thing ever going to be over....""

""Wall-e"" is a home-run for Disney and they rush out defective DVDs packaged in cheap cardboard. Should you be lucky and receive a disc in perfect condition, it won't take long for serious scratches to accumulate. Its obvious that Disney executives don't give a damn regarding customer satisfaction.After having received and returned two defective discs in succession, Amazon will not ship me a third. I get a refund but not a replacement. So, I'll wait a few months for reports stating that the defective disc problem has been resolved and then purchase another copy of ""Wall-e"". I'll also purchase an empty jewel case to replace the cheap cardboard package. Nice.Regarding the people who will mark my product review down simply because they feel that a review should be limited to a pure evaluation of the movie - I say too bad. Although I love this movie, I hate the way Disney has cranked out so many bad discs with read errors. I also don't buy into Disney distributing the product in a cheap package under the banner of ""going green.""  If you were fortunate enough to receive a perfect copy of Wall-e, then how nice for you. My review does not disrespect this excellent movie - it only gives an honest evaluation of a poor manufacturing and packaging process. Their quality control is sorely lacking.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2DCS39GFBJV24	Kenya Starflight	"Up until Pixar started going sequel/prequel crazy in recent years (""Toy Story 3"" was phenomenal, but ""Cars 2"" and ""Monsters University"" felt like missteps to me), I absolutely loved the studio's output.  They had a knack for creating extraordinary and well-constructed worlds in the most unlikely places, from a children's bedroom to a humble anthill to the Great Barrier Reef.  They weren't afraid to experiment either, venturing into more adult (though still family-friendly) territory with films like ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille.""  I even loved ""Brave"" and the first ""Cars"" movie, despite most people considering those two of the weaker films in their filmography.  They just had a talent for combining beautiful animation with great storytelling and iconic characters.With ""WALL-E,"" Pixar ventured into new territory... the science fiction genre.  And in the process they created one of their greatest films, with a plucky and adorable protagonist, an all-too-real view of the future, and a message that's clear without being heavy-handed.The titular WALL-E is a cleanup robot, gathering trash on an abandoned Earth, tending his pet cockroach, and amusing himself by collecting interesting trinkets from among the humans' accumulated garbage.  His pleasant, if lonely, life is shattered by the arrival of a spaceship carrying EVE, a scout searching for plant life on Earth.  WALL-E is instantly smitten by the sleek, businesslike EVE, and when she finds what she's looking for and is taken away, WALL-E leaves his home behind to follow her.  The two of them end up on the Axiom, a starliner full of humans who live in ignorant bliss, completely oblivious to anything but fulfilling their most immediate needs.  But EVE brings news from Earth that will shake the Axiom... and uncover a conspiracy among the Axiom's robots that could destroy humanity's chance to return home unless WALL-E, EVE, and some newfound friends can stop it.As always, Pixar's animation is phenomenal, and the visuals of this film are striking and memorable.  Not only are the outer-space segments gorgeous and the Axiom's interior's appropriately sleek and futuristic, but Earth itself is given plenty of screen time.  And it's a shocking picture -- a polluted landscape cluttered with abandoned buildings and skyscraper-sized towers of garbage, everything rusty, decaying, and filthy from centuries of neglect.  The robots are all well-animated too, and given unique looks that set them apart from most Hollywood robots -- none are humanoid and only a few (most notably WALL-E, EVE, and the cleaning 'bot MO) have humanlike attributes such as hands and eyes.  WALL-E does bear a little resemblance to Johnny 5 from ""Short Circuit,"" but this seems to be mostly coincidence to me.The film manages to convey a great deal of its plot without being overly obvious about it -- much of the backstory is established through advertisements and the striking scenes of a desolate Earth in the first ten minutes or so of the film.  It's a rather shocking contradiction to see WALL-E going about his day, cheerful and content, amid the destruction and decay of a virtually wrecked planet, but it makes the film's message ring all the more true.  And when the humans of the Axiom slowly begin to realize that in leaving Earth they have not escaped their responsibility toward their homeworld, the message isn't beaten into the viewer's head but is there all the same.  It's a timely message, and one that the film handles very well, especially given that so many environmental films (""The Lorax,"" ""Ferngully,"" James Cameron's ""Avatar"") are so heavy-handed in their message that they become hard to watch.One of Pixar's best films to date, this is a film for families and sci-fi buffs alike.  While it lacks epic space battles or aliens, it still has gorgeous images of the wonders of space, adorable robots, and an environmental message that's clear without being shoved down the viewer's throat.

One example is when The Captain learns how to walk they play the music from the begining of 2001. Another referece to 2001 is the robot Auto or the Auto pilot looks alot like HAL 9000 the main bad guy from 2001. WALL-E is right now, the highest rated movie of the year. I checked RottenTamatoes.com ALL-E is 97 Fesh. WALL-E has 168 Fresh reviews and a meseley 6 Rotten reviews.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1W661TC1P6VQI	"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi..."	"Hollywood is concerned about the environment.  That's the message I'm getting with most of the films I see these days.  I bought a few DVD's and CD's the other day and they were inside ""biodegradable packaging"" (which, far as I can tell, is a fancy term for cardboard).  ""Even Almighty"" was made not only as a message about the environment, but it also used environment friendly techniques such as double sided scripts and green screens.  Green screens are so friendly to the environment (as well as have the bonus of being cheap) that almost half the movies filmed this year are being filmed with them.  And if THAT message isn't getting across to the adults, then Pixar's new film ""Wall*E"" will make sure the message gets across to the kids at least.I must give Disney credit: They covered up what this film was really about VERY good!  The movie starts off on the planet Earth, which pans over a city with big skyscrapers and then...oh wait, those aren't real skyscrapers.  No, they are blocks of trash used to create life-size replicas of buildings.  The real buildings are in the back, worn down and unlivable in.  The maker of these fake buildings is Wall*E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), who is a trash cleaner on Earth, but has since then developed a personality and spends his time collecting odd treasures.  When he finds a ring box with a ring inside he throws away the ring and keeps the box, because he likes how it opens and shuts.  His only friend is a cockroach, who should give adults who don't want to see this movie a similar excuse to not see it as the ""I don't want to see `Ratatouille' because I don't like rats"" excuse I heard way too much.Wall*E's biggest treasure is a worn-out VHS tape of ""Hello Dolly,"" one that gives him great ideas about love.  Then one day, a robot called Eve drops on Earth, and after a few misunderstandings the two begin a great friendship.  Now most of this you'll have seen on the trailers.  Disney billed this as a first rate romantic tale to the masses.  And it is, for the most part, but the movies true purpose comes into play once Wall*E and Eve leave Earth.  That's when the movie takes place on the Axiom, a ship that was built by a Wal-Mart like corporation to house humans until Earth could get cleaned up.  And as if to point fingers at Wal-Mart even more, all the humans are fat, sit on hover chairs all day, speaking to other people on monitors and clapping their hands whenever they need a refill on their super sized sodas.I don't go to Wal-Mart very much, but the few times I do I can't help but notice a good portion of overweight people who drive around in electronic shopping carts, acting as if walking has become a chore to them.  This movie takes that idea to the next step and asks us what will happen if that gets to a point where we don't even push the buttons anymore, and just let machines take us through our day.  Not too comforting is it?  During this scene I noticed a rather overweight woman sitting in front of me, who stopped eating what was left of her jumbo sized popcorn and jumbo sized drink (though she had already finished her two hot dogs and mini-pizza by then).  Though these scenes may be uncomfortable for many people to watch, as I observed, it's probably a good thing in the long run.Goodness me, it appears this review has gone in some very political directions.  Sorry, but what can I say?  ""Wall*E"" itself goes in some very political directions.  Earth has so much smoke in the air the sun is red.  I'm sorry to say that in my city, when I woke up this morning, so was my sky.  This movie is very concerned about our health and how we treat our Earth, and I predict recycling and bike riding is going to go up in popularity in our schools after kids see this.  Though that leads me to another dilemma: I don't know how the primary target audience (AKA: Families and kids) are going to react to this movie.  The movie is wonderfully animated, extremely daring, unbearingly cute, and it has classic written all over it.In fact, with the exception of a few scenes with the Axiom's captain, the movie is mostly dialog free, save for some boops and beeps.  This makes the film almost universal, and people are sure to have laughed and cried by the end of it.  But what to make of the films message?  The message that true love is there for everyone will likely be embraced.  The message that we are not doing a very good job at taking care of ourselves is likely to be met with resistance (as well as a potentially less then happy box office performance).  But you got to give it to Pixar, they must know that the movies going to depress someone.  How else can you explain the inclusion of one of their funniest shorts, involving a bunny and magician having a disagreement over a carrot, before the movie?  In a strange way, this Tex Avery style slapstick short may come off more fun then ""Wall*E"" itself, and this is a cartoon where the two try to KILL each other!  Oh well, what's can I say?

You will absolutely fall in love with Wall-E because he is so adorable and sweet natured. I also love his pet cockroach.Short Summary: Wall-E is the last robot on earth and the only other existence on earth is his pet cockroach. That is until Eve shows up looking for a plant that proves that life can still exist on earth. All of the human life is taking a vacation aboard the spaceship Axiom while Wall-E cleans up earth. The captain is making the human race slobs because the robots are doing all of the work for them. Wall-E falls in love with Eve so he follows her to Axiom and that is when he comes in contact with the captain who wants to keep the humans on the spaceship. Can Wall-E save Eve and save the humans...watch the movie to find out.Also I loved the Pixar Short of Presto. The rabbit is so adorable in it. I think this was also Pixar's best short to date.You will absolutely fall in love with Wall-E. Who would of ever thought that you could fall in love with a robot but you can. Overall this entire movie including the short was an amazing film. Buy dont rent this movie. You will not be disappointed.	5.0	Disney/Pixar has outdone themselves with Wall-E	2009-02-19	2	1	1

I finally got a chance to and have to honestly say it was rather dull. The folks at Pixar are masters of their craft to be sure. I was absolutely blown away by the ARTISTRY of the film. The stunning landscapes, and intricate nuances of the robot world. Absolutely stunning! But the lack of dialogue and silly plot really dropped it down a few notches for me. Now I know all the ""artsy"" people out their would disagree. Yes, dialogue is not always necessary and can be used to a films advantage. I just don't think it worked with this film. The two main characters were endearing, but they repeated each others names a bit too often. If I had to hear EVE scream ""Wall -E!"" one more time!!! The plot was pretty weak, and silly. It's a shame because this had the potential to be another Pixar classic. But it's one film I don't need to see again."	3.0	VISUALLY STUNNING BUT BOOOORING............	2008-12-30	7	5	2

A lot of people do not like the way that they portrayed humans in the movie. I think the realization that our country could turn into something like that is entirely possible, and way too scary for some people to handle.  My kids liked it, but at 2 and 5 did not get the complexity or the moral of the story.My son especially liked the movie since there wasnt a lot of talking in it.

Wall-e is a robot left on earth to clean up all our trash since humans ruined the earth. They went into space where robots and computers did everything for them. They all got super fat.Eva comes from space to see if life as in a plant has returned yet. There she meets Wall-e and he goes back into space with her. It is sweet how they talk to one another and take care of each other.On a more serious note it does speak volumes about how we as humans do produce too much trash. And if we are not active and let machines do everything for us we continue to get fatter and fatter.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2JUGW79J738FW	K. J. Lehman	This is a cute movie. The kids love it. The lack of dialogue is refreshing. Lots of physical jokes and action more than make up for the regular snappy spoken jokes and innuendo. I have only tried the extras you can see on the TV and they are all wonderful. The games are a bit hard for my little ones (3 and 5) to understand. Actually, they were a bit hard for me to understand also, but the games are not why we bought the movie so it doesn't really matter.The only thing with this set is, I HATE, HATE, HATE the packaging. The paper is already showing a lot of wear and is ripping apart. I guess it makes sense (with the point of the movie being conservation) to not use a plastic case, but what sense does it make when your DVDs get so horribly scratched that you have to buy a new ones in the end? It's also difficult to store the thin cardboard packaging because it is lost among the bigger DVD cases. I think I will try to find an extra DVD case somewhere.Summary, movie great...packaging stinks.	5.0	Wall-E	2009-02-02	0	0	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1HHY7EFRT2KGQ	"klavierspiel ""klavierspiel"""	"This surprisingly adult animated film places a love story between two robots against a backdrop of a bleak, uninhabited earth not so far in the future, where WALL-E, a mobile trash compactor, continues to do his job with only a cockroach as a friend. He whiles away the time by collecting the remnants of human consumer goods and watching a video of ""Hello, Dolly."" One day a monstrous spaceship lands and discharges another robot, who turns out to be a ""female,"" and the tale begins.""WALL-E""'s post-apocalyptic vision of an ecologically devastated world is chillingly relevant in these days of ever-heightening anxiety about global warming. Although no human beings remain on the planet, it eventually emerges that they have survived, after a fashion. The director's vision of how people have fared is, again, all too plausible and none too flattering.The one drawback of ""WALL-E"" is that the opening scenes are so convincingly and absorbingly done that the rest is hard put to live up to them. When WALL-E, in pursuit of his lady robot love, reaches the space vessel that carries the remnants of humankind, the script resorts to standard action-adventure hijinks, diverting enough, which resolve to a moving though perhaps over-optimistic conclusion.Beyond the allegory, adults in general and film buffs in particular will be kept on their toes spotting  samplings of sci-fi film classics: I caught, without particular effort, references to Kubrick's ""2001"" (very obvious), ""Aliens"" (not only because Sigourney Weaver voices one of the roles), ""THX 1138,"" ""The Andromeda Strain,"" ""Blade Runner,"" and Douglas Trumbull's underrated ""Silent Running."" Moreover, the basic premise evokes Ray Bradbury's short story ""There Will Come Soft Rains"" from his Martian Chronicles (in which an automated house continues to function after its inhabitants have been incinerated in a nuclear blast). It is a measure of the skill of the director and the strength of his vision that the film doesn't become a mere patchwork of cliches. ""WALL-E"" turns the last-man-on-earth conceit that has been used so many times in science fiction on its head, in a gentle cautionary fable that nevertheless packs a powerful punch."	5.0	"""Inconvenient Truth"" as animated film, with added love story"	2008-07-11	8	6	2

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2YRZPGWLPB2OF	Kodi Kodai	I believe this was director Andrew Stanton's third Pixar film. His first directorial effort, I think, was Monster's Inc (which I couldn't really connect with). His second was 'Finding Nemo'- which is at the very top of my list as a Pixar favorite - and now here is his third film 'Wall-E'.I thoroughly enjoyed Wall-E. At the beginning of the movie as we see the robot on Earth I was completely taken in by the imagery and the cinematography: the lighting of the outdoor scenes looked fabulous! It didn't look like CGI and yet it wasn't completely real. I don't really quite understand why, but it just looked perfect. The two robots Wall-E and Eve, their personalities, through sound effects and animated pantomime, both seemed the most fully realized and remarkable creations yet by the Pixar people at the time it was released (2008).The overall story is excellent but the movie, however, feels longer than its 97 minutes. It seems like the film loses its focus somewhat when too much time is spent on the humans and their problems aboard that ship. It seemed as if there were a number of ideas left over and they decided to use them all, and that made it felt like the focus on the two main characters was diminished for a period of time. It felt a bit over-padded, dragging the film somewhat towards the end (however, it probably will not be any major quibble to other viewers). Thomas Newman's arresting musical score really elevates the quality of the film and enhances the drawing power of the film's romance between the two robots: the sequence of the rocket ballet between the two robots in space is sheer poetry.Wall-E goes on the very top of my animation 3D shelf with `Finding Nemo',`the Incredibles',`How to Train a Dragon', and Disney's `Tangled'.	5.0	Another favorite animated 3D film for the shelf	2013-03-24	0	0	0

Therefore, these short paragraphs will not be about whether the movie is good, but why you should or shouldn't buy the BluRay Disc, instead of buying the DVD version or downloading it through Netflex, Amazon, iTunes, etc.  Obviously, the difference between the DVD/dL version and the BD version are the extra features (and the higher picture quality).Wall-E definitely is loaded with content, and some easter eggs as well.  There are deleted scenes, interesting commentaries, quirky short clips, the ""Making Of"" (which is great), and much more.  However, these features are found in the DVD version as well.  The only difference between the DVD and BD versions (other than picture quality) are the games, a bonus short film, ""Burn E"" and a tour through the Axiom ship.To be honest, the bonus short film ""Burn E"" was great, but the games...  I found this to be boring.  The 3D tour of the Axiom ship, is nothing to get excited about - the video rolls are you fly through the corridors of the ship. wee. The commentary on the BD version is not found on the other versions because of its Pop-up nature (which can only work on BluRay players). This was a great treat, but I'm don't know many people who actually look forward to commentaries other than myself.In short, if you like the extra Burn-E video (which comes with storyboards, etc.) and great commentaries, its definitely worth the purchase.

The early scenes showing Wall-E painfully alone and longing for love are absolutely heartbreaking.  Happily, love does come in the form of a robot named EVE, sent to earth to detect plant life.

While watching for the first time we didn't notice that it was silent for half the movie, the characters were so expressive they didn't need to speak. Not an easy task when the actors aren't human!

Everything from the ships to the bots to the way the humans' pampered lifestyle has led to their becoming fat and weak... it all comes together perfectly, managing to provoke more than a little thought as well as entertain.I will watch this movie again and again.

This is how the story goes: Set in a galaxy not so very far away, WALLE is the new Disney/Pixar comedy about one determined robot. After hundreds of lonely years doing what he was built for, WALLE (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) discovers a new purpose in life when he meets a sleek search robot named EVE (Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator). When EVE comes to realize that WALLE has inadvertently stumbled upon the key to the planet's future, she races back to space to report her findings. And while she sets off to tell the waiting humans that it's safe to return home, WALLE chases EVE across the galaxy on his own unique adventure.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1OZAYRJQAERTK	Larry Benjamin	The beginning of the movie was delightful. The Wall-E character looked like he was modeled, at least in part, after the &#34;pilot&#34; of the &#34;Star Tours&#34; ride at Disneyland. He is an adorable creature with endearing quirks, such as throwing away a diamond ring, but keeping the box it came in. With almost no dialogue, the filmmakers convincingly depict the burgeoning romance between him and the EVE robot. Once the action moves to the spaceship, however, the story falls apart. We never learn why the little plant is so important. If it's a sign that the denuded Earth can once again harbor plant life, the battle for control of the plant is meaningless - once everyone on the ship has seen it, it's too late; the secret is out.Unfortunately, the ending is so implausible as to ruin the entire film. I understand that movies require a suspension of disbelief, but this does not extend to the acceptance of illogical developments. The ending is not &#34;hopeful;&#34; it is incoherent. We are asked to believe that the humans, who have never lived outside the spaceship, whose every need is administered by robots, who have never in their lives even stood up, will be able to survive (happily, yet!) on a desolate Earth, devoid of plants, animals, water, plagued by storms so violent that even the hardy Wall-E must take shelter, and most significantly, with no knowledge of agriculture! The Captain may believe that if he plants pizzas and waters them, they will grow, but this belief will not make it so. In a few weeks, the surviving humans, if any, would be back on the ship, begging the robots to allow them to return to their former lives.	1.0	Delightful film ruined by ending	2014-05-31	7	1	6

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AZ78HT7H9DVJG	LARRY	"I cannnot do *Wall-E* justice as other reviewers have been able to do so.  What can I say?  *Wall-E* is THE best animated movie...so far.  I was just in awe of it, even to the point of tears welling up in my eyes.Wall-E is this little trash compactor machine.  He's all alone in this world that was once inhibited by humans, 700 years ago.  He has one faithful companion, a cockroach.  Now, whoever thought that a cockroach could be such a cute creature?!?!  Wall-E's job is to compact as much trash, left behind by humans, as much as he can.  It's a lonely job.Then, out of the blue, scaring Wall-E, a rocket-like ship lands and releases a probe.  The probe's job is to find a living organism, specifically a plant, and bring it back for analysis to see if Earth is inhibitable once again.Wall-E is excited and lovestruck!  Over a few shy days, he soons learns that the probe is named Eve.  (This proves to be difficult for Wall-E to pronounce and he ends up calling her Eva.)The ship returns and takes Eve suddenly.  Wall-E, fearing that he'll never see her again, catches a ride on the exterior of the ship.  The ship makes a journey to the Axiom, where the humans have been residing for the past 700 years.This is where the action picks up where basically the robots and machines are the ones that save humanity.  You just gotta check it out and fall in love with Wall-E!  Cute cute cute yet packed with ""sublimal"" messages that you just cannot miss.Overall, Disney and Pixar gambled big and successfully won.  Homages are a-plenty throughout: E.T., Hello Dolly, Star Wars, 2001: Space Odyssey, Silent Running, Titanic and many more.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2T049UQONS0OY	Larry VanDeSande	WALL-E is an animated film about a lonely robot (named Wall-E) left to clean up an earth devoid of people that meets a female robot, named Eva, and chases her into space to be by her side. The travails our hero goes through in an alien world run the range of human emotions and technical imagination in this tour de force of both film and animation.This movie apparently came from the same crowd that brought TOY STORY some years back, another animation about computer-generated toys with human emotions. What WALL-E shows is that two robots can tell us more about ourselves and what makes us human than the best films about relationships and entranglements.It goes without saying that the animation in this movie is spectacular. I'm not much for animation and this is certainly the best film of that type I've ever seen. It must have impressed others, too, since it had the greatest weekend opening ever for an animation and won both the 2008 Academy and Golden Globe awards for animated feature.But it is far more than animation; it is a movie about us -- all of us. This is a movie for adventurers, intellectuals, sci-fi fans, families, children and just about anyone else. If you like movies of any kind, there is absolutely no reason not to see this film.	5.0	One of the best films of 2008	2009-09-05	2	1	1

One didn't have the extra bonus feature on the Pixar Story which I absolutely had to have. Another disappeared, so now despite buying four versions of Wall-E, I finally have the right one and only one because nobody is taking it until they pry it out of my cold, dead hands. Great Pixar animation, one of their best story lines, and of course, the bonus of The Pixar Story is worth it alone. In fact, you cannot get that little  feature anyplace but on this edition of Wall-E. You really have to review the bonus section list if you want this particular item.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AHJRK08FQXTTD	Lauren M. Snyder	This movie was just a stunning package of everything - heartbreaking music, touching characters, and a storyline that teeters between children and adult.The movie starts off in a horribly depressing post-apocalyptic-looking wasteland, which sadly, is Earth, after having been abandoned by humans for 700 years and is still covered in garbage. Wall-E, the roving garbage compacting robot, has been performing his task ever since the humans left Earth. In all the time alone, he has developed a curious and lovable personality, and he has created countless sky-scraper tall towers out of little compacted trash cubes. While we see the depressing images of the skeletons of Wall-E's kind broken among trash heaps, Wall-E moves among abandoned highways, with his little cockroach pal and a lunch cooler in which he collects his favorite trinkets.I knew this movie was supposed to be about a lonely robot, but I almost think that Wall-E doesn't even feel nearly as lonely as the viewer when they see the barren landscapes on Earth's surface. They did an incredibly job portraying the tragedy that befell the Earth and Wall-E's loneliness.I'm sure most people reading this know that Wall-E has a sleek, high-tech girlfriend named Eve. It's not love at first sight for the two, however. Eve arrives on the Earth's surface with the task of finding and retrieving and forms of vegetation. Her mission is hopeless until Wall-E shows her a little plant seedling he found and saved in an old boot. She is taken back into space, as Wall-E clings desperately to the side of the ship to follow Eve wherever she may go - to the new home of the humans, a ship called the Axiom.Wall-E struggles to win Eve's heart and protect his little seedling, as the captain tries to navigate the ship back to Earth, Eve realizes what Wall-E goes through for her, and the ship's computer Auto refuses to let that happen.You will also meet an adorable team of misfit robots including a vacuum bot with allergies, a boxing massage bot, and the not-so-misfit OCD cleaning bot, Mo.Aside from a couple adorable robotic sound effects, Eve and Wall-E's small vocabulary, a few old holographic videos still playing on Earth, and a few conversations between Auto and the captain, this movie really communicates without dialogue. Wall-E and Eve have a surprising array of emotional expressions, and you can't help but feel like these little robots have more human-like emotions than the actual humans themselves.I've never really been a Pixar fan because I was afraid that 3D is killing 2D animation, but Wall-E entirely restored my faith. This is definitely a movie I could watch over and over.	5.0	More human than humans	2008-06-29	8	6	2

Mostly though, I fell in love with the cute character of Wall-E and his sidekick, Eva!The only reason I didn't give ""Wall-E"" the full ""5 star"" rating was that the character of Wall-E sort of reminded me a lot of the character Number 5 in the 1986 movie version of ""Short Circuit""....

I thought to myself "" how can a movie about a robot that lives at a junkyard possibly be any good?"" Little did I know my entire world-view was about to be blown to pieces..yet rebuilt with glowing radiance by my little robot friend from the junkyard that I like to call Wall-E. The time spent watching..no..living this movie I must proclaim the most valuable in my life, and I am having trouble motivating myself to resume life outside of this movie. I have been watching it ever since. . i swear. I have lost everything but i feel no remorse, I have gained something true, something real, something substantially better than anything i could have ever wished for. Please, don't just watch this movie, absorb it. Soak it up for all it's worth and ring yourself out into the lives of the people who have not yet seen Wall-E, and therefore have not yet lived.

It's been one of the better movies produced by Pixar, although it was a little slow and confusing for me at first when I watched it for the first time.  The characters are charming and the message was incredibly profound in Pixar's usual unassuming and un-pushy way.  Some of the imagery (like when Wall-E was flying through the universe and observing the beauty of the cosmos) was just breathtaking.But I was on the floor with laughter at the bonus features.

WALL*E reminded me a lot of E.T, with his curious look at the world & his heart of gold. Along with stunning visuals (especially the large vistas), WALL*E is another more than solid Pixar film.

The people working there proved that it's not about the complicated story or the witty script or the-state-of-the-art graphics, for Wall-E has none of these. Despite that, the movie has it all... the beauty and simplicity of ideas, the humanity of characters, and the pure and genuine emotions. Although the character of Wall-E almost says nothing throughout the movie, it will certainly put you in tears of laughter and pity.

There are plenty of very good, very thorough reviews already, so I'm just going to add a couple of specific notes.It's a small thing, but I wish more dvds provided complete closed captioning.  While the director's commentary of the wide-screen Wall-E is closed captioned (and I applaud them for doing that), things like the deleted scenes still aren't.Also, it would have been nice to have some variety in the captains' gender or ethnicity. Sadly, all the captain photos are of white guys.  It may seem to be an inconsequential thing, but the aggregate of inconsequential things makes it clear that there is still a lot of subtle discrimination occurring in our world.  I look forward to the day where the only place you can find a collection of only white guys is in history books.	5.0	Director's audio is closed captioned	2008-12-20	0	0	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A6SNEHZIBFK4V	Living Life In The Midwest	"WARNING, CONTAINS SPOILERS!I was amazed at Cars. After boycotting Disney movies and toys for well over a decade I broke off my boycott after reading the Cars book before the movie came out. I took the kids to see it over and over. Cars really tested audiences to see if they could be more than entertained. Cars was a think peace but not so open and in your face about it as Wall-e is.Keep in mind I have boycotted Disney for close to fifteen years but after reading the Wall-e book can you imagine me in line for the first screening on opening day of Wall-e! There I was with my family and we were almost the first people in line. The movie was even better than the book because of the visual depictions of the polluted earth, the characters, and the settings. The Cars movie's creators warned us of forgetting our past, not stopping to smell the roses, blindly embracing the future, and the American life style of just moving around and going places for the sake of just moving and going. Wall-e's creators warn (more strongly) about blindly embracing the future and not stopping to smell the roses. They warn about our impending destruction of our mother (Earth) but offer hope in the form of the Axiom's Captain. Although he realizes that there are no dances, farms, music or anything left on earth he chooses to return people to earth to care for it. The closing credits give us a glimpse of how this will possibly be accomplished.There is a use of live action actors in this move that isn't really well like by some people but I think it's use is brilliant. It is used to separate the human beings of present day (in the movie the people of 700 years ago) from the people of the future, or the time the movie is to take place. They don't look the same, so kids can understand there is a difference. A secondary use is that it shows the damage done to earth was caused by people, not cartoons, and helps deliver the message more affectively to children.I have to agree with early reviewers of the book and movie: As an adult with a degree in electronics I was disappointed to see Wall-e could be repaired to ""himself"" after having every part of him replaced. He would have been a hero dead or alive, but it is a Disney movie so it has to have that ""Disney movie ending"".Watch it over and over. And for the record, Mo presses the self destruct button, not Wall-e as indicated in some of the printed book versions. Watch that scene closely for those of you who have read only the books."	5.0	This movie gives me reason to (temporarily) end my boycott of Disney.	2008-12-02	3	1	2

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A22RY8N8CNDF3A	"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist"""	WALL-E is another beautifully animated Pixar Movie, but a dark boring first half, and barely interesting ending.  This, along with no early dialogue, left the movie with the oomph of a pile of tin cans and meandering trash heaps.  The film's artwork of a futuristic world is well depicted, but WALL-E is alone on the earth and he cannot sustain interest.  Later on, he meets a girl robot, and love blooms - just beeps and squeaks throughout.  Much of it reminded me of a silent film with Charlie Chaplin. Having a cockroach as a friend was repulsive, not cute.Earth has become a garbage heap with a cloud of toxic smog.  Us fat humans have escaped, sent to outer space in a Space Ship that looks like a gigantic Caribbean Cruise ship.  All they do is eat and float around in deck chairs.  This is in the last half of the movie and the simple message is overdone.  The movie had a couple of smiles but the wait for something interesting to happen is tedious.	1.0	Boring and Repulsive -	2009-12-26	24	6	18

Because the movie is relatively low on dialogue, I thought it would be less likely to overwhelm them than a dialogue-intense movie.  I was right--they loved it, and were able to follow it well.  My only complaint:  in order to help students follow what was going on, I had Spanish subtitles showing as well, and the Spanish script and Spanish subtitles were not the same, which was confusing for some of my beginning students.  Otherwise, everyone enjoyed the movie very much.	5.0	Great movie!	2009-06-15	1	0	1

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2KHHQLUHHFTKC	Lucia d'Ancona	A bit of anime, sci-fi and romance blended up in a tale that's kind of short on dialogue and long on super-cuteness.  Wall-E, quite a remarkable little fellow appears to be the last in a series of machines charged with a massive planetary clean up job that will take him eons to complete alone.  It is clear that whatever humanity has managed to do to botch up the environment, it was bad enough to leave the surface pockmarked, scarred, littered with garbage and removed all traces of blue from the sky.  This blight seems to have caused mass exodus from our planet and transformed what's left of the human race to the most supreme obesity-riddled couch potatoes of the future.  What is evident from the very first scenes is how special he is and the rest of the story rides on the coat-tails of that understanding.  Wall-E has a lot of built in charm and the story sends a message about conservation and care of the earth while also asking us to look at issues of food and weight, inactivity and how we substitute playing with technology in place of good old human interaction.  &#60;3	5.0	Robotic Romance w/ a Socio Ecological Twist	2013-04-21	0	0	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A10WC7AS4PBZAM	"Luyi Wang ""Luyi"""	"WALL-E depicts the earth and human after 700 years in a creative perspective, when the earth becomes a huge trash bin and human beings lose their basic biological ability on a spaceship. The story follows a robot named WALL-E, who is designed to clean up a waste-covered Earth far in the future. He eventually falls in love with another robot named EVE, and follows her into outer space on an adventure that changes the destiny of both his kind and humanity. WALL-E distorts people's stereotype of animated films, which are known as childish and peripheral without profound thought. Although WALL-E has some humorous and pleasant plots to entertain the audience, it is an influential and inspiring film because it provokes deep thinking by challenging the benefit of technology, impresses the audience by true love between WALL-E and Eve, and sends a hope by finding a balance between people and machinesWALL-E works like a tale story to make people be conscious of some negative influence of advanced technology when enjoying the interesting love story between two robots. One question would catch people's mind after they watch the film, what is the true benefit of technology? In the film, people sit on automatic chairs and are extremely obese. Since people don't have enough physical exercises, pear-like human even lose their ability to walk and work normally.  In the film, human is no longer a dominant factor to forward the plot, but an ironic component used by the director to invoke the audience's thought.The film also encourages the audiences to imagine a world filled with trash, and we, human beings, have no place to live. When the camera zooms into the details of the earth, people soon find out that the high buildings on earth are actually countless piles of trash. The sharp contrast leads people to rethink the value of modernization, which can turn our beautiful and vigorous earth into a huge trash bin. Although it is an animated film, WALL-E ignites people's consciousness of protecting our earth from pollution.Different from other animated films made specifically for young kids, WALL-E shows a romantic love story between two robots. Although love is an everlasting theism in many films, how to express true and pure love through a 90- minute film can never be an easy topic for directors. But the robotic love in the film teaches the audience how to treasure their own love in daily life. The love between WALL-E and Eve breaks the traditional mode of Hollywood love story, which consists of romantic oath and affectionate hug between two lovers. In WALL-E, their words are limited, their emotions are hard to express, and even their sexual distinction is not clarified. But as the story forward, the audiences are deeply moved by their romantic love. When WALL-E falls in love with Eve, what he wants to give Eve is happiness and safety. In order to save Eve from danger, WALL-E leaves his home, gets to a distant planet and stays with Eve without hesitation. His brevity to seek true love moves every people.The robotic love story becomes especially precious for its purity, because more and more people consider money and wealth as part of romance and marriage. WALL-E is a good teacher of true love, because he knows what pure love is and how to be romantic. Though WALL-E does some funny and awkward actions to win Eve's heart, their impressive story redefines modern people's understanding of love, which actually means sacrifice for each other without asking for return.WALL-E also gives us a positive and hopeful future. With a warm ending of bright future, WALL-E shows its main theism that our life can be better when people can live harmoniously with different animals and work compatibly with machines. The ending sequence sends a signal of hope that we can find a balance between advanced technology and people without downside. The film uses picturesque and poetic images to show the earth after rebuilding. On the new-born earth, there are no more high buildings, no more factories and no more pollution. Birds are chipping, people are singing, and the two main characters are living together. What the earth has are green plants, vibrant animals and energetic people, who are working compatibly with machines. Although the future world in the film is utopian, it successfully sets up an ideal idea to have a biological balance between human and nature, so that people can live peacefully with all the creatures in the world.WALL-E has received nearly unanimous acclaim by film critics since its release. WALL-E won the 2008 Golden Globe Award for best animated film and ranks first in Time's ""best movies of the decade"". The huge success of WALL-E proves that animated films can also show profound thought. The film incorporates several major concerns in the real world, including modernization, love and harmonium, into one 90-minute animated film. Since WALL-E can put the audiences into deep thinking about their life and values, it is more than a simple film made for young kids. WALL-E actually explores the future of humanity in a pleasant atmosphere."	5.0	WALL-E: A Simple Way to Present Deep Thought	2010-02-14	4	3	1

Wall-E doesn't give up on his true love EVE though and he follows her to the end of the universe, or at least back to the main spaceship. The spaceship is the new home for humans who have evacuated planet Earth because the environment is over polluted and is uninhabitable. Not even a potato plant will grow in the nutrient poor soil anymore. The refugees from Earth rely on machines for pretty much everything including transportation and don't even bother to walk on their own legs.

I was not sure how or if a movie without dialogue would work, but it did.  Pixar did a fabulous job of capturing the emotion of both robots so well.  Once there is some conversation among the main characters, the tone of voice conveys the message loud and clear.  I did not expect to love this movie like I do.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3NM0RAYSL6PA8	"Maine Writer ""David"""	WALL-E is visually stunning.  The folks at Pixar have elevated computer animation by several very large notches, and created a world that is simultaneously hyper-realistic and stylish.  The result is immersive and beautiful.  That, in my opinion, is the towering achievement of WALL-E.  As for the rest, including the story and characterizations, it's a good film, but not great, and much more a film for children than adults.  And that's disappointing, since the really great animated films have worked on two levels, and brought a degree of sophistication that could please any adult.  Not so WALL-E.As an aside, it is worth noting that WALL-E stands head and shoulders above the lousy computer animated movies churned out by its competitors. In fact, compared to most of the popular movies this summer, it is far more intelligent and original. So, comparatively speaking, WALL-E is well worth the price of admission and sending a signal to Hollywood that there is an audience for intelligent films and solid storytelling.WALL-E suffers most from dragging on.  It felt bloated and unnecessarily long, particularly given the straightforward story.  The result is that much of the movie after WALL-E departs his home is repetitive both in beats and tone.  I kept wanting the movie to get to the point, which was, unfortunately, completely predictable.  Now, I don't expect children's movies to be entirely unpredictable.  After all, we're talking about an audience that probably needs as much of the familiar as the unfamiliar.  But, I kept waiting for WALL-E to get to the clearly telegraphed point.  It, eventually, did.There were some truly tender moments between WALL-E and Eve.  And, unlike some other Pixar efforts, like Finding Nemo, human beings, while generally disgusting, are given a glimmer of character and decency.  I like having children's movies paint human beings as capable of redemption, and WALL-E at least does that.To me, the best part of WALL-E was the opening short subject about a magician and his hungry rabbit.  Delightful, unpredictable, and vastly more satisfying that WALL-E.Given the amount of gushing over this movie, you'd think folks were starved for decent movies.  Truth is, they are.  We all are.	3.0	Decent movie, but far from Pixar's best.	2008-06-29	32	16	16

At some point, they will resolve the disc issues. I would hate to see people pass on the movie because it got a bad rating due to disc problems!We weren't sure we wanted to see this movie at first.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AFTRQTNS1YRM8	Marie Ross	"This movie is absolutely my four-year-old's favorite movie. Honestly, we only got it for him because he loved the movie Cars and he loved robots so we figured Pixar and robots might be fun. I was a little bit skeptical that it would be interesting enough for a 4-year-old; it seemed more for older kids/adults. We were not prepared for our son's reaction to the movie!He almost instantly connected with Wall-E and thought Eva was just about as cool as Wall-E did. During his first watching of the movie, he was so enthralled and excited by everything. We tried to explain some of the events and concepts going on to him as the movie played and frankly we were surprised at how much he seemed to understand. Then when Wall-E gets damaged... he got so upset we were going to turn the movie off. But he insisted on watching it through. We were so surprised with the amount of empathy he felt (and showed) for the main characters! I don't think we'd imagined he could feel so strongly, demonstrate those feelings, and try to verbalize them yet. I think we were as much floored (in a good way) with his reaction to the movie as we were with the movie.He would watch it everyday (multiple times a day even!) if we would let him. With each re-viewing his reactions are still wonderful to watch and be a part of. His emotional connection with the characters still amazes me. We have been able to expand on ideas like recycling and conserving resources though Wall-E's plight. We have been able to introduce him to the idea of space and planets and the Earth being a planet we live on. Of how important friends are and how we should take care of our friends (by being nice, sharing, helping, etc). The idea of needing exercise to stay healthy, Gardening, vegetables, and eating healthy, and so many more concepts that are somehow more tangible to him now because of this movie.After many repeated viewings, he is still as enthralled with the movie, but he ""participates"" so much it is almost an event to watch him watching the film! He warns Wall-E about dangers (calls the red lights, ""bad bugs""), he sympathizes with Wall-E when Eva goes dormant, he gets excited with Wall-E stowaway space flight, he laughs and jumps around when Wall-E and Eva dance in space, he joins in cheering on the Captain in his struggles with Auto, and is still dismayed when Wall-E is damaged! He assures us (and himself) that Eva will fix him, and then excitedly cheers on Eva as she works to repair him. And well I could probably go on for paragraphs about his reactions and emotions but I think you can get the idea. I can't think of anything in the movie that is really scary (maybe the big trash compactor robots?), but there are some sad parts definitely (though temporary).For a younger child, I think this movie offers a lot more then just entertainment. From an emotional and social standpoint this has helped make some concepts we were struggling to teach our 4-year-old more tangible, real, and applicable to his everyday life experiences. From a learning POV, it has introduced quite a bit of science to him in a fun way that we can readily expand and elaborate on. Even for older children, I think it could still be a great jumping-off point for the same concepts and ideas I mentioned previously. And for every age it is an enjoyable and poignant movie that looks amazing and will engage you on multiple levels.This is one movie you will want to enjoy with your child!"	5.0	Wonderful for kids and adults!	2010-12-29	1	1	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	The opening shot is of downtown New York City.  Only these aren't normal buildings but towers of blocks of trash.  WALL-E (voiced by beeps and Ben Burtt), our hero, is a glorified trash compactor who has made the mountains.  As we follow him across the vast landscape, we learn that he is the last of his kind and that he is indeed on earth.  Humans fled years ago because they bought into the commercialism of the Buy-n-Large stores that ruled the earth.  The resulting garbage overran the planet.But WALL-E is not a mindless robot.  He is curious and collects bits and pieces of things that are still intact.  At night, he takes these to his bunker where they are on display a la Ariel.  His only companions are a cockroach and a video tape of Hello Dolly.Into this world comes Eve (voiced by beeps and Elissa Knight).  Eve is another robot but much more high tech.  She is on a classified mission.  WALL-E immediately falls for her.  So much so, in fact, that when the spaceship returns to collect Eve, WALL-E tags along.  Suddenly, the two find themselves caught up in an adventure with the future of mankind at stake.  Can they save humanity?This isn't quite Pixar's best, but it is very good.  I mean, we've got robots who hardly speak as our main characters, yet we are completely rooting for them.  And even though the dialogue is limited, these robots have personality.  But it was the limited dialogue that got to me.  I got tire of long stretches where the only words we heard were Wall-E and EVE calling each others' names, especially during the climax.There are few characters here.  Frankly, that makes sense due to the extra effort it takes to develop character and story without dialogue.  And the story was a tad slow in spots, but it usually picked up about the time I was ready to move on.There are some many cute and funny moments in the film.  While most of these will appeal to the whole family, even those that kids wouldn't get are appropriate for all ages.The animation is spectacular throughout, but this is especially true once we leave earth.  There are some space shots that took my breath away.There are several morals lurking just below the surface of the film.  And you know what I appreciated abut them?  They lurked just below the surface.  Oh, they're hard to miss, but the story never stopped to lecture us.While slow at times, I had a smile on my face by the time the film was over.  And really, that's what it is all about.	4.0	An Out of This World Famil-E Adventure	2008-11-18	3	2	1

I preordered the Blu-Ray versioin of Wall-E months before its release--at the time there was no description. As the release date neared, Disney started running ads touting the Blu-Ray with the digital download. I thought it would be great to have a choice of watching it on my HDTV or iPhone. When my package arrived (a day early), I quickly opened it and looked for instructions on getting the download. When I couldn't find any info, I checked Amazon and discovered that now there are two versions of the Blu-ray. This two disc package and a three disc one. Only the three disc version comes with the digital download. Worse, both are priced the same. Amazon, you ripped me off.Since I opened the disc already, I'm sure I can't return it.

From the previews the movie theaters showed, it looked like the most ridiculously stupid movie one could ever see. Because of the reviews, I figured I was wrong, so I forced my family to see it.  Surely it MUST be good, if so many other people loved it.  Someone even said it topped Toy Story. Sorry, but i didn't even come close to being as good, let alone topping it.  My whole family thought it was boring and would never want to see it again.  My kids range in age from 12 to 22.  My husband fell asleep, so it's not great for adults, contrary to reviews.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3ONTLXQ85EE4G	Marshall Lord	"This film ought to have worked.For me, applying adult judgement, Pixar are a brilliant outfit who have great production standards, tremendous imagination, an amusing and quirky sense of humour which provides something for adults watching with their offspring, and enormous skill at animation. None of those things were missing from this film. My children have enjoyed everything else Pixar have done - that's an understatement - and I expected them to love this DVD too.They didn't.The trouble was that the bleak and lonely start, with the last robot on an abandoned Earth, having been left on his own for centuries as he gradually tidied up a planet humans had messed up, was played just a bit too strongly to work for my seven-year-old children.The sombre opening reduced my daughter to floods of tears, and after about 20 minutes she gave up and went off, thoroughly depressed, to do something else. My son did watch the whole film, and reported that overall the film was ""OK"" as there were some ""better parts"" but this was a much less enthusiastic response than he normally gives PIXAR's offerings.I think that this illustrates the old saying that no-one can please everyone, and particularly that nobody can please every child. I am quite certain that millions of other children will have loved this film. Unfortunately some didn't like it, and my daughter was among them.I am not writing this review with the intention of advising other parents not to get this for your children. It's very possible that they will get far more out of the film than my two did. But if your children are on the soft-hearted and sentimental side, watch it with them, and be ready to put something else on if you do find that your family, like mine, is one for whom this particular film does not work."	3.0	Even the best can't please every child every time	2009-05-24	12	10	2

It is a funny movie for both adults and children -- the perfect movie to take children or grandchildren to see.The use of minimal dialogue is a challenge to the viewer.  With the limited facial expressions available, the makers of this movie did an amazing job of conveying the plot and the emotions.The obese people were a sad insightful comment on our eating and exercise efforts.  It affected me!  I had a low-calorie salad for breakfast!I have two negative comments about the movie.  One is that the message seems to be that human beings are ruining the earth.  I think placing this message in a children's movie is a cheap shot.  This bad feature is redeemed in the conclusion by the return of humanity with an effort to green the planet.The other is that the movie tended to drag after the half-way mark. I had the feeling that more plot or less time would have helped. The redundancy of the action placed our eyeballs on a treadmill while our bodies sat and watched the fat people watch their screens.  Maybe I felt that way because the movie motivated me.  I was ready to get up and move.Despite these problems, it was a good movie, worth going to see.

This computer animated film is intelligent and beautiful enough where anyone, no matter what age, can feast their eyes (is that the phrase?) on this DIsney sure-to-be classic. What else is to expect from Pixar? I believe that this movie is their most important one--there is very little dialogue in the first half of the movie and it tells its story through the visuals. But don't let that bore you. WALL-E is expressive and adorable and we care about him from the first frame we see him in. As more characters are introduced we care about them too, and they are animated and voiced (if at all) wonderfully. There is a good, if overused message at play here, but you should see what that is for yourself. The music is great, the live-action incorporated bits are fun, and the story is involved and deep. Just watch it, you don't need to read reviews like this to see this awesome film. Buying the DVD would be worth it :)	5.0	A beautiful and heart warming film--it's not just for kids.	2009-01-18	1	1	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2R6RA8FRBS608	Matthew G. Sherwin	"Wall-E packs a lot of action and emotion into an all too brief 98 minutes of cinematic ""pow."" Wall-E is a tour de force for Pixar which pulls this off without a hitch. The excellent animation and the live action combine to showcase good taste and creativity. Director and co-writer Andrew Stanton worked very hard on this film; and much credit goes to the numerous animation staffers and the rest of the crew as well.When the film starts, we quickly meet Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt), a robot designed to clean up the incredible global junkyard left behind by humans who refused to care about the environment. People now live in space aboard spaceships including the Axiom, which was designed by the huge corporation Buy N Large. Wall-E roams the remnants of an evacuated city; and he collects some of the stuff he finds as he packs away the garbage into tidy little bundles so that maybe someday humans can return to Earth. Wall-E's only companion is his pet roach who subsists on a Twinkie-like cake's creamy filling. Wall-E's only real entertainment comes from watching a VHS tape of Hello, Dolly! every night after work.One day a huge spaceship lands on Earth where Wall-E is working; and out of it comes Eve (voiced by Elissa Knight). Eve, predictably, is a female robot whose name is an acronym for ""Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator."" Almost instantly, Wall-E is smitten; he is lonely and he finds Eve attractive as well. Unfortunately, Eve's mission must remain ""classified"" and although she can't say much she sure is strong and threatening at times! After Wall-E gives Eve a plant, Eve becomes unresponsive and she returns to the spaceship. In order to be with her Wall-E bravely scales the spaceship from the outside and he hangs on for dear life as the ship shoots up into space.The spaceship with Eve, the plant and other similar probing robots heads for the Axiom. Once at the Axiom, Eve is evaluated and Wall-E is not exactly welcomed with open arms. The captain of the ship (voiced by Jeff Garlin), who does very little because it's all on autopilot, eventually lets Wall-E get cleaned up after his trip but the plot doesn't stop there. We meet many humans who are now living on board a ship that has cruised through space for 700 years even though the original Earth cleanup mission was only to last five years. People just don't care; they became almost vegetable-like as they recline in chairs and talk to each other through computer like monitors. They certainly aren't getting any physical exercise!It isn't long, either, before there are more complications and confrontations. There are some ""bad"" robots including Auto (voice courtesy of MacInTalk), the autopilot machine. Auto wants to stay in space but the captain thinks they should return--after all, the plant Eve got from Wall-E proves that life is possible again on Earth. At this point there are many references to the relationship between HAL and a human being as depicted in the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick.It may well seem that I've given too much away, but I left things out even up to this point. And what happens next could surprise you. Will Auto or The Captain win the power struggle about returning to Earth to make it once again inhabitable? What about Wall-E and Eve--will Eve finally return Wall-E's love for her? What about the humans onboard the ship? Will they stay practically riveted to their chairs to merely exist or will they want a real life on planet Earth? Watch the movie and find out!The extras are all very good; but I particularly enjoyed Presto and Burn-E. Of course, if you get the three DVD package of this film you'll get a lot more bonus features.Wall-E will forever be a classic Pixar animated film; the importance of taking good care of Mother Earth is also timeless. The plot deals with the universal themes of love and hate, and it pits good against evil. The level of the violence is not too high; therefore I highly recommend this film for people of all ages."	5.0	splendid animation--and why we need to ask ourselves what we really want	2009-03-01	3	2	1

Wall-e is a very cute and likeable character, and for a little, clunky old robot, he has a lot of personality. It's apparent that he has gained self-awareness, and in a world where he is alone, he manages nicely.We all wonder what happened to the humans, but that's revealed soon enough and is a big part of the plot of the movie. It's thought-provoking as this is a post-apocalyptic film, and is a good commentary on our current state of affairs. Eve's relationship with the robot is endearing, and I adored the ending sequence where they used various styles of art... cave-paintings, Egyptian, Minoan, Greek/Roman, Byzantium mosaics, medieval, and various styles of Renaissance and Impressionist-emulated styles show how the humans are progressing after the end of the film for a creative and fantastic montage which ultimately ends with a rather poignant image.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3KEZLJ59C1JVH	Melissa Niksic	"""Wall-E"" is the story of a small robot with a big heart. The last of the ""Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class"" robots, Wall-E's job is to compact the garbage that's taken over Earth and caused humans to abandon the planet some 700 years ago. Wall-E dutifully goes about his job, but demonstrates many human characteristics, including a desire to love. When an EVE probe is sent to Earth, Wall-E falls hard for her and follows her back to the Axiom, a luxury spaceships where what remains of the human race has been loafing around for the past several centuries. The captain of the ship ultimately joins forces with Wall-E and EVE in an effort to return to Earth, but they must overcome powerful technology that's been in place for a very long time.I appreciated this movie's charm and innovation, but didn't like it quite as much as I thought I would. I appreciate the eco-friendly messages ""Wall-E"" is trying to send, but the ending of the film bothered me because it seemed too easy. What happened to all of the waste that had been polluting the Earth for many hundreds of years? Did it just disappear? I think it sends the wrong message that pollution can always be overcome, even if it takes hundreds of years, but the reality is that if we destroy Earth, it may never be habitable again. I would have preferred to see the humans in the film colonize a new planet and take better care of it instead of have Earth magically restored to its past splendor.Enough of my soapbox, however. ""Wall-E"" is still a very cute movie. Also, Fred Willard is in it, and he's absolutely hilarious. What more could you want?"	4.0	Good movie, but it sends the wrong message	2009-05-19	2	0	2
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1U360OMVQRPUB	Mel Odom	"WALL-E hit theaters today and packed the seats a noon at my local movie house.  I've enjoyed every Pixar movie that's come out, and this one is no exception.  However, I have to admit that after the deluge of trailers that have haunted the television set later I was expecting to be blown away.I wasn't blown away, but don't misunderstand.  The movie was a good romp that kept all the tykes in the audience on the edge of their seats throughout, and there were quite a few giggles for the adults too, but the movie just hit all the expected twists and turns without becoming anything more than an adventurous love story mixed with ecological and physical health issues.The movie takes place about eight hundred years in the future.  Message #1 comes about when all the viewer can see is endless mounds of compacted refuse stand as towering high-rises.  Wall-E, our everyman hero, toils alone in the garbage heap that used to be our planet.  Well, there's no denying that axe because everyone in the film grinds that one home.  When there was nowhere left to stack refuse, humanity abandoned the world and went out into space.That's a sour but realistic take on the world's current population, but I have to wonder if a spaceship would actually launch into space with no destination.  According to the story, the people aboard the Axiom have been in space for 700 years.  How was population growth maintained?  How about food sources?  If the ship was capable of regenerating food and water every day, why wasn't that done on earth?  But I digress.  In my defense, Pixar writers and developers generally do a much cleaner job of world-building.Wall-E is an adorable character.  The thought and care that went into his construction is immediately evident.  In a way, he reminded me of Johnny Five from the movie SHORT CIRCUIT, but that was good because Johnny Five was a kid-friendly character and movie as well.I loved Wall-E's mannerisms and the motions he was capable of as he went about his daily job of crushing trash.  His home was a delight and many of the kids, including mine, laughed and enjoyed everything.  Pixar is so good at details in these movies that I'm constantly surprised at the depth to which they think about everything.  Having Wall-E visit the graveyard of his fellow robots was a great touch.  It introduced the pathos of his loneliness, pointed out his eventual future, and explained how he kept working away after wearing out parts.  The bit with him hanging his treads up as he entered his home was terrific.Eve is a robot of a different sort.  She's sleeker and more powerful, and definitely quicker on the trigger.  I didn't quite warm up to her as much as Wall-E, though she is our heroine and female romantic lead, but the expressions they were able to create with her eyes alone were fantastic.Wall-E continues showing up for work every day even though the rest of the world has bailed on him or become totally dysfunctional.  That was incredibly touching, though no explanation is given for why he developed a personality.  Eve's arrival to search for plant life (though we don't know that for a long time, and there's not really any reason given for why the AXIOM couldn't simply have gone on to another planet) changes Wall-E's existence forever.The fact that he was able to fall in love with her was great and served the story, but Eve is portrayed as having no personality.  I had to let that go because part of me wanted to be an adult and learn how the AIs had progressed that far.  See?  I struggled with technology versus fantasy throughout the film, but that may have just been men.When I looked at the movie through a child's eyes, I was kept happy.  The characters are cool.  The visual aspects are beautiful.  And the pacing is thrilling.I was impressed by how much could be done with the computer ""voices"" of the characters.  The feeling and emotions I projected on them were as much from the situations they were in as from the tonal quality.I also especially liked Auto, the robotic second-in-command of the AXIOM, because he was so nasty.  His design as a ship's wheel was awesome, and the holes in the ceiling that allowed him to pop out anywhere was exciting and made for tense moments.The plot is simple and straight-forward, but the Pixar people obviously had a blast putting this one together.  It runs like a Swiss watch and hits all the emotional triggers for the audience as plucky Wall-E and Eve take on Auto to bring the earth back to the people lost in space.WALL-E is definitely going to be another hit masterminded by the Pixar people.  One of the best treats is the short cartoon feature before the movie.  Don't get to the theater late and take a chance on missing it.  This one left me laughing out loud because it was so inventive and wildly funny.  Take the kids out to this one.  And if you don't have any kids, take yourself out and be a kid for a couple of hours.  You'll have great time."	5.0	Robots In Love!	2008-06-27	10	7	3

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	ARIFZNTDV8K42	MFV	Forget the fact that it's a cartoon, Wall-E is simply one of the best movies I've seen.  Written beautifully, with seamless animation, and with direction that brings storytelling to a new level, this movie engulfs you into the life of one little forgotten robot.There is something so pure about Wall-E. There's not a selfish gear or wire in his entire little trash-compacting body. His only goal is to serve, help, and love - truly the most selfless character ever portrayed on the screen.  And as it turns out, he's the wisest character in the movie, simply because of the fact that he follows his heart. It's this kind of altruism that leads to greatness. Can one little robot save the human race?.....This one can.In my eyes, he is one of the most hopeful characters on film.  He can be put in the same category as Atticus Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird, Andy Dufresne in Shawshank Redemption, or Roberto Benigni in Life is Beautiful. All characters that never give up hope because they see that life is indeed too beautiful to waste on selfishness and waste. And all characters that can reach through the screen and inspire the viewers to become something better than they are.  For Wall-E, not only is the glass half full, but he's always striving to fill the other half.Wall-E's my hero.  Watch this movie and he'll become your hero too.	5.0	One of the Best Movies I have ever seen...	2008-11-19	4	4	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2ORHH9A828AUR	M. Holley	I enjoyed this movie. I am a big fan of Disney/Pixar movies and they have delivered another worthwhile movie for both young and old. I saw this movie in the theaters and already decided at that time I wanted to own it on blu-ray. The animation is incredible and Wall-E and Eve are too cute. I read some reviews that felt the message was delivered too strong, especially for many children but I feel that children look at movies different than adults. This movie is for both children and adults. It can be a eye opening experience for some that see the environmental impact humans can have with earth. I realize that some people may get offended at how humans are portrayed but if you focus too much on that then you will miss out on the beautiful relationship that grows between Wall-e and Eve and Wall-e's endearing, innocent, personality. I feel these types of movies become great classics because they do deliver a wonderful story yet maintain a sweet innocence that children love.I like that now some movies come with a digital copy or a regular dvd copy for the kids so you don't have to worry about the kids damaging the expensive blu-ray disc.Disney has also commited to taking full advantage of bd-live features so that kids can have plenty to do long after they have watched the movie 100 times.Overall I really enjoy how much Pixar/Disney includes in their blu-ray editions. So may other studios seem to not care to stuff their blu-ray editions with extras that will take advantage of the technology, disc capacity and bd-live. I look forward to future Disney blu-ray releases to add to my collection.	5.0	Adorable movie with also an underlying environmental message.	2008-12-30	0	0	0

Wall-E, a trash disposing robot is left on Earth for cleanup duty, all alone except for a tiny plant he grows and his endless love of ""Hello Dolly"". Enter Eve, a robot sent to what remains of our desolute planet to see if it is capable of habitation. He meets her, falls in love, and a deep friendship soon ensues.Pixar makes the best animated films, simply due to the realistic themes that allow us to see the truth in the world as well as ourselves, only in animated form, and Wall-E is yet another great masterpiece of filmmaking. It touches on the environment and the eventual damage yet to come, loneliness, friendship, love. Powerful themes we can all relate to.

Unfortunately the disc is defective and will not play on my system without constant freeze-ups.  This does not happen with any other DVD's.  Sadly, I'm going to go through the refund/return process.  My two star on the movie is my frustration with the disc, not the movie itself.  Wall-e is one of the cutest little animated characters produced.  Some might call the film a message movie, I don't think that's the primary point.  A case can be made for most animated films having some kind of message, it's all how/why you want to see it.

Wall-E's only function is to pick up trash on a future earth that has been damaged and contaminated so badly that humans have evacuated to an outerspace utopia to wait for the Earth to be decontaminated, Wall-E has a pet cockroach for crying out loud. By his nature, Wall-E is a curious thing and is attracted instantly to Eve because of her sleek and mysterious ways. Together, they mount a quest to show the captain of the space habitat that life can now be sustained on Earth and face a number of challenges including an army of robot police enlisted by a robot population that has no desire to return home and years of built up human apathy.Beneath the children's feel good message though, are serious adult undertones. On the ship where the Earth's residents are being housed, they have become obese pigs because everything is handed directly to them, they hardly ever have to get up to exercise or any other physical activity and have virtual entertainment activities pumped to them through simulated screens. This could be easily read as a commentary or at the very least a parallel to modern American society.	5.0	Robot Love with a Serious Adult Message	2009-06-26	2	1	1

We already know about the lack of dialogue, the amazing visual effects, and the political commentary of a sedentary life of ecological neglect.  I watched it with my wife and my 18-month old toddler.I loved the movie. Loved it.  Loved the old-school shout outs to computer users everywhere, from the Mac boot-up sound of WALL-E to the iPod-esque design of EVE.  Loved the wry comments on the future of civilization: roaches and Twinkies! Loved the very notion that it's possible to get too caught up in one's climb up the career ladder (EVE) or stuck in a rut (WALL-E), and that there are more important things like life and love.  It's a worthy successor to The Incredibles and makes me forgive Pixar for Ratatouille.My wife questioned why there were babies on the spaceship Axiom: If everyone is just staring into screens all the time, when do they ever have time to procreate?  When two humans finally do look away from their screens, they seem genuinely surprised by their attraction to each other.  Which implies they haven't been doing much interaction at all, begging the question: where do the babies come from? Yes, these are the conversations we have in our household.My theory was that the babies were actually cloned.  Keeping the babies fat and happy was a sort of Machiavellian torture by the robots, who needed servants to continue to function and keep the status quo.  If you consider the long-reaching plans of robots that have been doing this for hundreds of years, Wall-E takes on a considerably sinister tone.Or, ya know, maybe it's a cartoon and we shouldn't worry about it.My toddler seemed to get bored about halfway through.  Even the cool special effects could only retain his attention span for so long.It wasn't until the next day, when we were at Home Depot, that we knew he was really paying attention.  There was a washer/dryer combo displayed side-by-side on a sign.  The doors to the appliances looked suspiciously the two eyes of WALL-E.My son pointed and said a new word, ""roh-BOT!""So I'll put him down as enjoying the movie too."	5.0	"""roh-BOT!"""	2009-03-10	6	5	1

I had pre-ordered two months ago and was anxiously waiting to see this, but the first time I watched it I was rather disappointed that the magic I have been used to for 60 years just wasn't there. That is where I found Wall-E to be lacking.Far too many individuals have taken offense at the gratuitous ecological message that plays throughout the entire movie, but I have to laugh at that idea...sure, the trash piles are larger than the sky scrapers, but the message I got was an extreme exagaration rather than a harsh warning.Wall-E is an entertaining modern cartoon with a story, but if you are looking for this to be a classic, nooo. I've watched it twice since, and it does grow on you, but don't expect that warm fuzzy feeling like in earlier Disney classics...	4.0	"Very good movie, but lacks the Disney ""magic""..."	2008-12-01	0	0	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AW99SBGWEXP0J	Michael Zuffa	700 years into the future, Earth is uninhabited.  Humans have left its wasteland and now live among the stars.  Left behind to clean up the mess are WALL*Es (Waste Allocation Load Lifters-Earth class).  After all this time only one WALL*E (Burtt) remains.  He goes about his insurrmountable job, collecting and compacting trash.  One day, things change.  A spaceship arrives and a robot named EVE (Knight) emerges.  She is on a mission of her own, but soon becomes friends (of a sort) with WALL*E.  When the time comes for her to leave, WALL*E hitches a ride, and is off on a new adventure that may just save the human race.Pixar has done it again.  WALL*E is an amazing film that introduces one of the most loveable characters in recent memory.  The animators humanize the robots through their actions, making the audience care for them.  There is very little dialogue in the film, especially in the first half, and the high quality animation drives the story successfully.  There is an ecological message to be found here, but it isn' forced.  There is enough humor and action to entertain the whole family.  WALL*E is probably the best family film of the summer, and I highly recommend seeing it.	5.0	WALL*E	2008-07-21	5	4	1

The film's messages about human's slothfulness, waste, and the dangers of monopoly capitalism are both timely and impactful.  What really amazes me about this movie is how much attention the folks at Pixar pay to physics: they really worked on the dynamics of the robots and the items they interact with. I know firsthand from having met John Lasseter at a party and discussing how they modeled the spring motion of the headpiece on a toy soldier's helmet (this was years ago) how much work goes into this part of their movies. It makes the whole experience that much more believable as you don't have to deal with the traditional ""cartoon physics"" that tend to exemplify the genre."	5.0	The best animated movie of all time, bar none	2008-12-27	0	0	0

However, Wall-E has achieved exactly that.First, I was gob-smacked to realize in hindsight that there is no spoken language for a considerable amount of time at the beginning of the film.  It's substitute is the body language between a very antique robot and the cockroach that he befriended.Second, the interaction between Wall-E, the cockroach and later, Eva, another robot, though a very high tech one, is captivating beyond expectations.I don't want to give away any of the story, but would like to say that this film is a gem in it's genre and sure to collect an Academy award in 2009.Go and watch it.

I realize I may be committing heresy by being the lone voice to speak against the tide of people who loved this film.  (And I think this library computer is even mad at me, for it logged my out, thus erasing half my review, making me have to start all over again, while I answered a phone call and went out for a smoke.) And, actually, I'm not scaredy-cat of watching and liking family or kiddie movies. Why, just the other day I watched and liked Bridge to Terabithia. I watched Wall-E with my friend, and she always puts the subtitles on first no matter what the film. She and I can hear perfectly well...she just likes subtitles. She was exclainimg to me, ""How are we supposed to know what they're saying without subtitles???"" when the little robot things started to talk. And, frankly, that's what I say. I found the plot to be incoherent, like they were patching in additions to the plot as the movie went along. Both me and my friend were so bored and uninterested in Wall-E that, at the halfway point, we turned the DVD player off and took naps. We eventually watched the rest of the movie a few hours later.

This was a very cute movie and at times, you can't help but shed a tear ( I'm not afraid to admit it!).WALL-E basically takes place in the distant future when Earth is nothing more than a waste land covered in nothing more than, waste! You can't help but notice that more than 45 minutes into the movie, you see no humans. It's not until WALL-E, a robot trash compactor, stowaways on a ship destined for a space cruise ship. When we see humans on the space cruise ship, we learn that anyone left alive are on this huge luxary cruise ship light years into space. All humans are rather portly and tended to their every needs by robots. The robot co-pilot has a striking resemblance to the robot from the spaceship in the Disney movie, Flight of the Navigator ( Was this Disney and Pixar's last work together; then that will explain it).Back to the movie! WALL-E is a trash compactor sent by the company BNL to earth to clean it up. All during his shift, WALL-E collects items that he believes are either collectibles or something he can use to fix himself. He ""lives"" in a rundown type of a trailer. WALL-E has  VCR tape (yeah, can you believe it??) and watches a really old film (taking into consideration of what the time period was in the movie). Surprisingly, it's an old dancing film with a little bit of love mixed in. WALL-E mimicks the dancing to the best of his ability and then ""learns"" about hand holding.Later on in the movie, we meet E.V.E, a more advanced robot on a classified mission on Earth. She hovers, has  a hovering head, and a laser from her right hand that would make all men evacuate the area :) WALL-E is intrigued by her presence and remember the old movie. He tried to befriend EVE and find out why she is here. When EVE finds a plant, she puts it in her body cavity and ""hibernates."" All this time, WALL-E protects her and tries to wake her up. WHen it was raining it was cute how he held up the umbrella to keep EVE dry and  gets struck by lightning twiceWALL-E tries to follow EVE when the spaceship comes to pick EVE up. EVE's true reason for coming to earth is revealed later in the movie ( I don't want to give it away for those who haven't seen the movie). Will WALL-E find love with EVE? Would EVE also learn about love? It was cute when WALL-E got into trouble in one part and EVE bellows, ""WAAAALLLLEEEEEEEE!"" This was a cute movie and most kids will just see it as a movie unless parents teach about the environmental issues that are ""subtly"" in this animated film.The packaging (casing) is horrendous. Probably the most horrendous that I've ever encountered. A few papers in there create such a mess and the DVD only sits in what amounts to an area that was cut out to fit a DVD. It's like making a meatball hero and when you want to fit the meatballs in the hero, you dig out the bread in the middle so the meatballs fit inside easily. Great analogy, right?The movie was cute, warm, and had a great message about life, love, and environmentalism. I'm not ashamed to admit that I was going to shed a tear when WALL-E almost died twice. Another happily ever after ending from Pixar! They should work on better packaging of the film however."	5.0	A Tear Jerker!	2008-12-19	1	1	0

It has been 700 years since Earth became a garbage-strewn wasteland unfit for life. But WALL-E continues to go about his daily routine of compacting trash into cubes and stacking them sky-high. He's never without an Igloo cooler for collecting interesting relics, which he takes back to a home he has made for himself in some sort of defunct vehicle. But WALL-E is lonely. His only companions are a cockroach and old videos. One day a rocket lands on Earth and deposits a slick, hovering new droid called EVE. EVE has a single-minded mission and a deadly blue laser beam. But WALL-E does all he can to stick by his new friend.""WALL-E"" is clever and funny for kids and adults. Its creativity is astounding, especially in the Earth sequences early in the film. I was especially impressed by the film's ability to make its characters' plight affecting with almost no dialogue. I can't say that ""WALL-E"" resembles a silent film, because it is very dependent upon sound effects. But it does share an intensely cinematic nature with silent film; the dialogue of the main characters is almost limited to two words, their names. Comparisons to R2-D2 are not a coincidence. ""WALL-E""'s sound designer Ben Burtt was the same who did the sound effects for ""Star Wars"". The two robots sound nothing alike, but what little they say has great personality. WALL-E is aided by a team of top-notch animators, of course.Director and co-writer Andrew Stanton has said that he had no socio-political agenda in making the film. The trash-strewn planet was just meant to provide a reason for why WALL-E would be left alone on Earth. Regardless of what was intended, I took the allusions to conspicuous consumption and waste and the fat, inactive humans luxuriating on a resort space ship to be deliberate in their criticisms. But it's true that these ideas remain in the background and are easily overlooked, for better or worse, because the characters are so captivating. Pixar is back in its stride with ""Ratatouille"" and ""WALL-E"" after the just-for-kids flicks ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Cars"". ""WALL-E"" is great fun for all ages. I laughed out loud. Even adults may want to see it twice.The DVD (Disney 2008 single disc edition): Bonus features include 2 short films, a featurette, 2 deleted scenes (9  min) with optional commentary, and a feature commentary. ""Presto: Theatrical Short"" (5 min) is about an illusionist whose performing rabbit doesn't take kindly to not being properly fed. ""BURN-E: All New Original Short"" (7 min) follows the misadventures of the little welding droid that we saw making repairs on the Axiom's hull. ""Animation Sound Design: Building Worlds from the Sound Up"" (19 min) interviews sound designer Ben Burtt about his sources, history of sound effects, how he decides what sounds things should make, and more. In the feature commentary, director Andrew Stanton talks about his inspiration for the story, characters, and visuals, how the film evolved, music, the film's logic, and WALL-E's actions.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1WYENJ1QI2S7I	"mitch ""mitch4406"""	Time and time again the PIXAR people hit a home run with their fresh ideas. They have done it here with a story that 6-13 year olds will love as well as a sci-fi story line adults will find stimulating. WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter- Earth Class) is the last of his kind- one of the thousands of robots who were left behind to clean up the world we've trashed. It seems that humans, rather than attend to their own problems and clean-up their own mess, have split. The lovable robot is very diligent in his duties to clean up the earth. He goes about his daily tasks in a very workman like manner, occasionally taking a break to manipulate an object, ponder it's function. Since WALL-E and a friendly insect are the only ones left there is no dialog for the first 40 minutes or so. Even with that deficit the movie is utterly engaging, the animation superb. Eventually WALL-E falls for a female? robot named EVE (Extra Terrestial Vegetation Evaluator)who arrives on earth to look for life.The last part of the story revolves around the descendants of earth dwellers who now reside quite comfortably in space. Spurred on by the monolithic corporation known as 'Buy n Large' the space faring humans continue on with our materialistic and consumer driven lifestyle. When WALL-E shows up on this Faux-Utopia worldlet everything, as you can imagine, becomes chaotic. The movie is entertaining and fresh and addresses big picture issues that the kids won't fully understand. But that's OK they will still find WALL-E's personality to be funny & interesting. As for age suitability I saw this movie twice in the theatres and during both screenings pre-school kids became very antsy before the film ended- it definitely did not hold their attention. This movie is not 2001 but it is not Bambi either.	5.0	One of Top 5 films of 2008	2008-11-01	4	4	0

Even though ""The Dark Knight,"" ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" and award season has yet to grace us with its' presence, the title for best film of the year can already be settled.  ""WALL-E"" is a once in a lifetime classic, a pure example of movie magic that soars on the power of untamed imagination.It is now an undisputable law of nature, right up there with Newton's ironclad rules regarding gravity: Pixar Animation Studios cannot create a bad movie.  It's simply impossible.  ""WALL-E"" is just the latest, hell, maybe greatest computer animated feature these wizards have cranked out, and visually, it's awesome.  From the breathtaking shots of a futuristic Manhattan long since abandoned by man and overtaken by arid deserts to the ethereal beauty of outer space, director Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo) and Pixar's peerless animators channel the best imaginations in sci-fi cinema (be it Kubrick, Lucas or Cameron) to craft their own audacious visuals and, in the process, their own sci-fi masterwork.  Make no mistake, this is one of the best pure science fiction films to come out in a long, long time, encompassing themes of environmental neglect and misuse and the corrosive influence of technology on the human condition.  That all holds true, even if it's main character is a lonely trash-compacting robot.Speaking of that robot, WALL-E itself is one of the most endearing, charming and enchanting characters Pixar has ever devised.  Ben Burtt, who provided the vocal palette that made R2-D2 so emotive, infuses the same anthropomorphic magic into WALL-E.  Combine that with Pixar's patented obsessive attention to expressive detail, and you have a mechanized animated concoction that rarely says a word but beeps, bloobs and sings with soulful life.  For the first 30 minutes of the film, WALL-E, along with his pet cockroach, is all we see as he follows his daily routine, cleaning up the trash and pollution that humanity left behind when it fled a deteriorating and toxic earth for the vast openness of space.  Catch is, WALL-E is the last of his kind.  All the other robots have broken down.  But WALL-E still erects mountains of processed garbage everyday, outrunning sandstorms at dusk while at night watching old movies, his favorite being ""Hello, Dolly!"".  And that's the other funny thing: WALL-E has been around so long that his AI has given him something in spades that futuristic humans long since stymied: a spirit that relishes in the simple beauty of odd pieces of junk or in the simple, heart-warming pleasure of hand-holding.  Humanity itself, after 700 years away from Earth and under total control from robotic systems that make them slaves to their own pleasures, has forgotten all of that.  It's WALL-E who exudes all it is that makes being alive worthwhile.But then, the film skillfully adds another dimension to itself; a moving love story.  One day, a sleek, brilliantly white-colored robot named EVE, who searches for signs the Earth has healed, visits WALL-E.  That and blasting anything that moves.  Her first encounters with WALL-E are funny, touching and make you believe in the universal understanding and power of love.  Their courtship and acts of mutual affection are the stuff dreams are made of.Once EVE has found what she is looking for, however she shuts down and signals for pick-up, back to the space-bound humans that sent her.  It's here that the film gets a little more straight-forward in its narrative, but you'll still be enthralled by the film's heart-stopping beauty, the deepening love between WALL-E and EVE, the timelessness of it all.  Pixar has outdone themselves.  In aiming for the stars, they crafted a masterpiece that landed among the heavens shining with a life-affirming light."	5.0	The Stuff Dreams Are Made Of; The Best Movie of the Year	2008-07-04	10	8	2

We bought Journey to the Center of the Earth that came with the digital copy. You just put it in the cd drive of the computer and you downloaded the movie from a web page to your computer. Wall-E however, requires you to have a dvd drive. This was not mentioned when I read the description (or maybe I missed it) but now I paid extra money for something I can't use. So, I wanted to spare someone else out there with an old computer that wants to watch this on their system the same experience.

This tiny box of metal conveys so much with his little beeps and body movements it is just amazing to watch. Then Eve comes along, and these two have some great chemistry for robots who can really only say each other's names. Okay, so it can be slow at times and not what the kiddies might expect from a Pixar film, but I feel this one falls in with Ratatouille in terms of quality filmmaking. This isn't just for the children. It is done in a way to make sure it is a timeless story for all to enjoy.I almost forgot. The little bunny short film before the movie is really good, and dare I say I enjoyed it more than the main feature.

I don't mind a plot with a lesson, but I don't like a plot that is entirely a lesson.  There is a difference.  That is the essence of Wall-E.Ignorant mankind has destroyed the environment and man had fled to space.  All that is left is Wall-E, a mechanical E.T. rip off that is a garbage collecting robot.All the people have fled on spaceships and do nothing but indulge themselves on soft drinks and television.  They are all so obese that they can't get out of their chairs.Translation - hey kids, we are all fat, lazy, and commercialistic.  We are destroying the environment, blah, blah, blah.After writing this review I'm going to go throw an aluminum can in a regular trash can.  I've been inspired to pollute.  I'm also considering changing out my gas furnace and putting in an old oil tank.You know what I miss?  (of course you do)  How about a good `ol cartoon like Thundarr the Barbarian.  That dude would run around in his beaver pelt underwear chopping things up with his sun sword.  The moral of the story?  Nothing!  Just administering the beat down!  Thundarr didn't stop to tell me I should ""be a good friend"" or ""learn to share"" or ""don't do drugs"".  He just found some action, yelled ""Ariel...Ookla...Ride!"" and opened a big `ol can on some future techno-monster mutant.Thundarr sort of evolved into He-Man - another dude in beaver pelt undies with a sword.  How awesome is a show that begins with an intro that includes the hero punching the tv screen?  Yeah...  Plus, we get to see Teela running around - that's an added plus. Of course, He-Man would be 29 minutes of beat down and then 1 minute of ""be good"" message at the end.Now we are stuck with Wonder Pets, Backyardigans, Dora the Explorer, and other lame cartoons that are 100% message.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3NQ3KK6A16XJT	MovieMusic	"I checked the 1 and 2 star reviews, and there are people who did not like this movie. How could anyone not like this movie? I'd give it 9 out of 10. It made me think about designing a better tool for the average moviegoer to make a decision. So I tried calculating the combined percentage of 4 and 5 star reviews on a few movies I have reviewed recently.My early conclusion? The average person should not even contemplate watching a movie with a combined 4 AND 5 STAR TOTAL of less than 75%.This movie has 83%, but it is only that low because of a tsunami of people complaining about faulty discs and other issues (who often then say they love the movie). I have recently rated four movies at 1 star. ""Changing Lanes"" (4+5 star total = 62%), ""Crash"" (63%), ""The Village"" (51%), and ""The Ladykillers"" (45%).Contrast this with a couple of other movies that spring to mind that I liked. ""Field Of Dreams"" (88%), and ""Sister Act"" (94%).To finish this preliminary thinking about quality, another movie I rated 1 star, ""Freejack"", is at 73%. It is fairly watchable, but ultimately makes very little sense. It wasn't good for me, but maybe it's OK if you don't think too much about it.I hope one day Amazon will automatically tally the 4 and 5 star percentage to help customers make more informed decisions.P.S. I just thought of the last movie I really hated, ""Black Swan"" (56%). I think this is a tool worth perfecting.Next day, perfecting begins : A movie I rated one star called ""My First Mister"" (89%) demonstrates the first problem. It only has 65 reviews, which clearly is not enough. ""Changing Lanes"" has the fewest reviews (170) of the other movies I mentioned. So I'll be paying much less attention to percentages calculated from less than 100 reviews."	5.0	An AMAZON idea for better movie selection .....	2013-04-15	0	0	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1QQWYFL5WCYMD	"Mozer ""Moe-G"""	"Wall-E in parts:MusicalsIf you know me, you'll know that I hate musicals - mostly, not entirely, but musicals are basically not my thing.  The first time I saw Wall-E, was the week the DVD became available for sale.  I promptly bought it (and subsequently bought the 3-disc package through Amazon), because so far I had loved all Pixar product released (I have some issues with Incredibles and Rata-tool, but I mostly love them also).  And, lo and behold, if my heart didn't sink at the beginning of the movie...I went a little cold, and started thinking that Pixar had gone the way of Disney animated films of the 80's and 90's - I thought that Wall-E was going to be adopting the musical format of the parent company.  But nothing could be further from the truth (thankfully).  The musicals and/or musical love/lover concept was injected into the story in the best most imaginative way I could never have imagined.Story ArcThe story is the reason why I feel Wall-E should have been considered for an Oscar nomination - much more deservedly than Beauty and the Beast.  Because for me, a good story is when the main character's journey is really and truly well told, and when you can palpably see the evolution and or growth of one or more characters - one palpable moment is the scene where Wall-E is busted up pretty badly, he gives Eve the plant and says ""Directive.""  Not only do you actually see Eve's growth and transformation into an emotional being, but Wall-E persists and reveals for her the grander and mor important ultimate ""Directive"" of going back to Earth.  I compare this with the growth and transformation of two sisters in Sense and Sensibility (Emma taking the cake with her virtual climax of emotion near the end), and Amy Adams in Enchanted when she convulsively realized that she is capable of feeling anger (that scene made the movie worthwhile for me).AnimationHayao Miyazaki is a master animation director and most of the Pixar directors are master animation directors (I will include John Kricfalusi, Tex Avery, Bob Clampett, and Hannah & Barbera to the master animation director category - I'm sure there are others, but their names escape me right now).  I believe that a sure-fire way to make fluid animation look crappy and ultimately turn out lousy is by doing a formula or format type of animation direction. I've come to loathe and practically convulse when watching characters make strange and unnecessary emotive motions, hand movements and gestures - if you know Futurama, it is probably the type of motion that Harold Zoid would actually like.The joy of joys for me in animation, are moments like in Ren & Stimpy where a lot of their emoting is done mostly with their eyes, but then Stimpy manages to anger Ren and all hell breaks loose.  One might wonder why directors, if they truly want to take their craft seriously, can't see how the drama is intensified when things are mostly static and motionless until the moment is right and everything goes wild - or just the mere fact that if you were to see the same movements that you see in a lot of animation, translated to live action, you might think that there was some sort of weird Ed Wood revival of directing going on or something.Bob movements.  I hate bob movements of meaningless, head, hands, arms, and body motion.  Andrew Stanton has just about perfected the elimination of bob movements in animation with his work in Wall-E (the same can not be said for the Rat-a-tool guy).Animation studiosOf course, I don't hate everything that comes out of Dreamworks animation, but as far as I'm concerned, Katzenberg is heavily involved with a lot of what I hate in modern animation.  I'm talking about formulas and forcing every single gwad-lovin' animation feature idea into a musical format...did I mention that I hate musicals (for the most part)?It doesn't stop there though.  There's something about using or misusing pop-references (in all movies, not just animation).  The way that a lot of studios use pop-references (including Disney and Dreamworks) pretty much guarantees that the particular film will become dated, and not a timeless classic.  And not only does the film become dated, but I hate that feeling when I get into a movie and try to loose myself in the film's fantasy, but all of a sudden I get the cold-water-splash of a pop-reference that lets me know it's only a movie.  I mean, how can I loose myself in a film, when the characters start quoting popular movies or making reference to the Terminator or something similar.  To me that's like the pin-prick popping the balloon.There's hope though, I think, because I feel the Madagascar movies and Kung Fu Panda had some great stuff in them.  I pretty much hate all their other stuff.  It really broke my heart to see all those beautifully designed Aardman characters move in those god-awful bob movements that Nick Park would never do...well, I guess I would add Chicken Run and Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit to the love category, although I don't strictly consider those 2 films as Dreamworks movies.  Plus, add to the ""there's hope"" in animation, the movie Happy Feet from Warner Bro's.A moment to shed a single tear for the death of trad/drawn feature animation in the U.S....But anyway, in my opinion, Wall-E re-certified Pixar, as the top feature animation studio in the U.S."	5.0	Wall-EeeeeeEEEE-Ha!	2009-02-27	1	0	1

Its adorable and appeals to a wide range of people of all ages and types.  The mix of Robot design, sound effects, and a nice storyline make this a very enjoyable movie to watch.Wall-E is the only thing left on earth (besides a cockroach friend of his) and he spends his days cleaning up trash like he was designed to do.  The humans who left earth behind left it filled with stuff and from this, Wall-E, collects interesting objects.  Among these is a plant, lightbulb, and the movie Hello Dolly which gives him aspirations to love.  His world is turned upside down however, when EVE arrives.  EVE is on a mission from the human spaceship to see if there is life on Earth yet.  Although she is openly hostile at first, Wall-E eventually becomes friends with her and gives her the plant he found.When she is put into lockdown mode and the ship picks her up, Wall-E hitches a ride to where they both go to the Axiom, cruise ship of the humans.  There they have to fight their way through hostile robots to prove Earth can sustain life, and bring the humans home.  They have some friends along the way, John and Mary, the interesting humans who can't do much (like the other humans) but are willing to try.  And some robots in need of repair, whose quirky manners are skills Wall-E and EVE can use.Wall-E is one of my favorite characters of all time.  He is just too cute and the way he expresses his emotions gives me a big smile.  EVE is contrast is his warrior woman and definitely the fighter between the two.  The humans are rather sad, but at least they try to improve things for themselves.The music in this film is good, it is mostly songs taken from Wall-E's movie, Hello Dolly.  They seemed to fit though and carried along the scenes nicely.  And what scenes they were!  Wall-E is computer animated and that makes for some truly beautiful work.  Most especially the scenes in space are very vivid.This is a great movie for anyone and I highly recommend watching it for a charming and light-hearted movie.  It also teaches a great lesson about love and responsibility.Characters:Ben Burtt-Wall-EElissa Knight-EVEJeff Garlin-The CaptainFred Willard-BnL's CEOMacinTalk-AutoJohn Ratzenberger-JohnKathy Najimy-MarySigourney Weaver-Axiom's computerReview by M.

I havent had the trouble some others have had with the discs themselves. the packaging SUCKS. BIG TIME SUCKS.Its very difficult to remove the inner sub-sleeves (I wont call them cases) from the outer package (again I wont call it a case) the first time without accidentally ripping the sleeve apart. The die-cuts on the sleeves want to grab one another and the outer package. Children will almost undoubtedly end up tearing the sleeves and probably the outer package apart just trying to get the sleeves out of the package to watch the disc.After buying so many dvds & dvd sets in nice molded plastic cases, to get a cheap cardboard case, and a poorly designed one at that, is very disappointing (especially when compared to the other Pixar dvds in my collection.

'Wall E' is nothing short of amazing and steps outside it's ""kiddies movie"" boundaries with this smart and endearing Sci-Fi love story! While the film is short on dialogue, it does not suffer from having nothing to say! It's amazing(there goes that word again!)how much is said without the use of ""words"" in this beautiful and poignant film.Not since R2 D2 stole the show in 'A New Hope' has a little robot had so much character and charm. Wall E says little, but his feelings are so well conveyed you won't miss one heartbeat! Besides having many great and lovable characters, the animation is truly breathtaking. The story may be a little too deep a satire for small children to truly understand, but they will fall in love with the characters anyway.This is one of the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made bar none! It's a monumental achievement on every level and Pixar should be very proud of their new baby!......It's just fantastic! I can't wait to watch it again and I will this weekend. The 3 disc set is wonderful with so many great treasures to uncover and a beautiful DVD transfer to boot. Wall E is nothing short of spectacular and it should be up for Academy Awards across the board!****ONE SIDE NOTE**** My copy had problems playing for the first half hour or so, I'm waiting for a replacement to see if it's an isolated case or the entire batch of DVD's is bad, I will add the information once I know more, it would be tragic if this fantastic movie's release is defective by design!****DVD UPDATE**** I bought a single disc edition and it played perfectly, I am going to buy another 3 disc edition to see if I it's defective. I will add when I know more.****NEWEST DVD UPDATE**** I received my replacement for the 3 disc and it is defective as well! I guess I'm going to keep the single disc. Too bad. The 3 disc has some great material on it.The defective disc does play perfectly in some of my DVD players while not so well in my home theater Denon 3910 machine!? I have had this problem with only a hand full of discs,1)Casino 10th anniversary2)Hammer box set(Evil Of Frankenstein)3)Rodan(new 2 disc edition released with War Of The Gargantuas which plays perfectly?)4)Wall E (3 disc version not sure if the 1 disc version has the same problem?)I hope Disney is going to correct this problem and offer replacements."	5.0	PIXAR'S MASTERPEICE!

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AYBL30P5NXNZ4	"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a"""	What a little treasure of a movie!  This is arguably not just the best animated movie of the year, but possibly simply the best movie of the year.  There is an unabashed love of the essence of cinema, of visual stimulus and sound to tell a story which is rarely seen.  Certainly, rarely imbued with such originality and warmth.Our little hero is a waste disposal unit, left on an earth which is polluted and trashed, slowly making his way through huge mountains of garbage.  He has evolved a personality since mankind left 700 years ago.. a personality that lets him learn how to hold affection for EVE, a modern sleek robot who arrives one day on a secret mission.  When she returns to space, Wall*E follows and he finds out what has happened to mankind and may even hold the key to changing their path, as he forms a deeper bond with EVE.The opening scenes are breathtakingly beautiful and detailed - the squeaks and whistles that form Wall*E's voice truly define his personality to the audience, and his antics never fail to draw the viewer in, as he collects artifacts (in a way reminiscent of Ariel in Little Mermaid).  In truth, the most cartoon and unbelievable characters in the movie are the humans, once Wall*E finds them.  That quibble aside, we are left with a movie put together with huge care and attention which delights from beginning to end.  For the cinema buff, there are enough references to classics such as 2001, Silent Running and others to appreciate along the way.It certainly cannot be overlooked that this is probably the finest animation Pixar has ever achieved.  At times during the first 20 minutes especially, you could almost be watching live action.  But it is not just the quality of craftsmanship of the manufacture of the movie.  Once again, Pixar have created genuine characters - even if they ARE `just' robots, and, crucially, storytelling that really works.  Joyously, the eco-message is never slapped in your face in a moment of sentimentality.  The tightrope between gooey sentimentality and genuine warmth is duly walked, with stunning effect.All in all, an unmissable movie - if you think you don't like animation, get off your high horse and prepare to be gobsmacked.  If you like Pixar's output already, prepare to see them at their most imaginative.Simply perfect.	5.0	Finest Animated movie ever made?	2008-12-13	1	1	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1OKAPXIZYB9TR	Naomi R. Rhoads	"I love the Disney/Pixar movies. I own every one. I eagerly anticipate them when a new one is released. It was no different when they began advertising Wall-E. But Wall-E was like no other Disney/Pixar ever made. Though most of their movies tell some heart -warming story with a moral, Wall-E was much different. In a day and age where global warming and life-after-people are hot topics, Wall-E gave us a vision of what this might actually look like, wrapped up in a G-rated, ""meant for kids"" format.Though meant to be a children's film, there's argument that parents will get more from the messages being sent. It's even arguable that the first half will hold the attention of this ADD generation. With its sparse dialogue, and at times complicated story line, kids just may lose interest before having a chance to see the whole thing. What moral conversations might they miss out on?There are many social commentaries that Wall-E brings up. First, the desolation of earth and the lack of humans inhabiting it. Outliving his intended position, Wall-E continues to do what he was created to do - gather and compact garbage. But while doing that even Wall-E sees that not everything is trash but finds value, beauty and joy in common, everyday objects. We as humans have been blessed with free-will, intelligence, and creativity. But, as depicted in this movie, we can glean that self-destruction can come from these things just as easily. The world's inhabitants didn't die off but were driven off by their need for stuff. In this story a mega-store called Buy n Large (need I draw the comparison to WalMart?) encouraged this consumerism attitude, thus filling the earth with their mega stores and garbage. The end result was the ""stuff"" overtaking the earth and the need to create a space station to save the human race. In return, humans became fat, lazy, self-absorbed, convenience hungry addicts. Most are oblivious to the world actually happening around them. They are physically, emotionally, and mentally fed by technology and the newest generation of specialized machines. This included Eve, a research probe sent to earth who also grabs the heart and attention of Wall-E.We see in their romance a theme of getting back to the simple things of life. This is actually the running theme to the whole movie. From the artifacts of the past that Wall-E collects while still on earth to the captain learning what farming and dancing is. The captain sums it up himself when he exclaims, ""I don't want to survive! I want to LIVE!""Have we as a society become consumed with convenience, entertainment, and technology that we have missed out on the simple things of life? Has it taken a children's movie about the future and the rise of technology to bring that to light? Where is God in all of this? Maybe that's the missing link. In our search to find our purpose, our way in life we attempt to fill the void we feel with ""stuff"". The pace just continues to amp up in our attempts to find happiness in the consumerism. In John 14:6, Christ tells us that He is the way, the truth, and the life. We scurry back and forth seeking happiness in games, entertainment, and valuables, when real happiness is found in our relationship with God. Wall-E and Eve, creations of the future remind us of the simple things we have lost. Technology, the convenience we've created, are not bad in themselves. The same drive to create new things and improve upon the old (or buy, sell, and collect) can create the potential for disaster. But it can also push us to an appreciation for the simpler things, thus driving us to our Creator and what He has created us for."	4.0	Wall-E and Engaging Culture	2010-02-10	0	0	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A250AXLRBVYKB4	"Nathan Beauchamp ""ConsumerAdvocate (nathan(at..."	"If you told me beforehand, ""I want to show you an animated film with almost no dialogue about a trash compacting robot,"" I would probably laugh in your face. Dialogue is such an important element to any movie that I might have easily assumed it would be awful; something concocted by adult science fiction fans intent on pushing their interests unto the younger generation. However I don't mind admitting when I am wrong, and never have I been so wrong than when I told those who invited me to watch WALL-E with them that it would not be a good movie. It is not just good, it is amazingly good, and easily the best animated film I've ever seen.I know there will be movie buffs and purists who will extol the virtues of SNOW WHITE, or FANTASIA, or even TOY STORY, but to me, this movie exceeds those older Classics. As part of a younger generation accustomed to computer animation and with no particular love for hand-drawn cartoons (although I do love SPIRITED AWAY), I find the polished, digital animation in WALL-E to be visually unparalleled in quality.However, this isn't a digital wonder with no heart. The story is touching, heartfelt, witty, romantic, frightening in its portrayal of un-curbed consumerism, and altogether delightful. With elements of classic science fiction (the oh so HAL 9000 like shipboard super computer) juxtaposed with a modern, polished take on robotics (like the white i-pod exterior of EVE), the movie delivers for the true science fiction fan and child alike.Even if you have little or no interest in science fiction as a genre, this is still a beautifully told story that is not dependent on the science fiction elements to be enjoyable. WALL-E is a great character, filled with hope and imagination and an insatiable curiosity that any child will relate to. Eve, his 'female' counterpart is dramatically powerful, cautious, and ultimately as 'human' as WALL-E is.A film that I will watch again and again, and one which I am completely sold on, is perfect for children and adults alike, and one of those rare films which can be watched together with neither party feeling put upon. 5/5 stars and a must buy for anyone with children, or who is a child at heart."	5.0	The best animated film ever?	2008-12-26	2	2	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1DK5AZMXS1QA3	Newton Ooi	"If one were to try and describe each Pixar movie with one word, I would describe Wall-E with the word ""soul"".  No other animated movie, and few movies overall, come so close to describing the human condition as this one, and yet most of the major characters are not even human.  I first saw this movie in the theaters, and now own the DVD.  A careful watch of this movie reveals scene after scene that capture and expresses various facets of the human condition.  For example, take Wall-E's care of his pet cockroach; his finding twinkies for him to sleep are oddly reminiscent of the care many humans take of their dogs and cats.  Compare this with the condescension the Axiom's autopilot has of the ship's captain.  The power behind the throne, Pixar style!  Another revealing persona is M-O, the small cleaning robot.  I look at him, and reminisce about that one guy in the office who's always stuck refilling the printer paper, and instead of throwing away old printouts by other people, carefully stacks them by name besides the printer.  Or take Wall-E's courtship of EVE.  There have been many movies about the guy from the wrong side of the tracks hooking up with the girl from the right side, but surely none as innovative as this one, with as many ooh's and aah's.  Maybe the best is the portrayal of the future.  Probably no other movie so captures mankind's future as this movie, and for an American-made movie, Wall-E portrays the future of the world in which the American culture of consumerism and corporate-sponsored governance has become dominant.  Notice the fact that Buy N Large's CEO also happens to the last President of the world.  Could this be a take of George W. Bush?  Or maybe humanity's escape from a world it destroyed.  Could the world portrayed in Wall-E be be the equivalent of inner-city Detroit's destruction by neglect writ large oversaw by a people who'd rather satisfy their personal desires than their society's health.  Few other movies have provided such a strong yet nuanced criticism of modern society as this CGI masterpiece.  For those who say modern Hollywood does not produce great movies that are also great works of art, I recommend they watch this triumph by Pixar.  This is a must for any DVD collection."	5.0	Animated perfection	2008-12-10	4	4	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A250GDVGXJK2NS	Nicholas Jordan	"Visually everything in Wall-E is stunning.  Thankfully, Pixar has also continued its decision that technology always must serve the story rather than the other way around.  This film in fact makes it clear that Pixar sees technological hurdles as opportunities for creativity.  The company's past problems of effectively computer animating humans are sidestepped.  Real human actors play roles in video recordings from the distant past (Fred Willard as a mega-powerful CEO of the WalMart-esque Buy `n' Large chain), and the rendered humans are tremendously obese after several generations of extreme laziness (rounder surfaces being easier to render than realistic ones).The review for families is this: Go see it.  Kids will love it, and adults will be entertained by it.  It's not as great as Pixar's or solo Disney's best, but it is very good.  Many of the scenes are just plain magical, but the movie as a whole is not.The problem is the message.  When my brother-in-law said that he thought Wall-E was overly political for a children's film, I knew that there was some ecological message behind the film, and I knew that my brother-in-law's political views are fairly far to the right of my own.  Unfortunately, he was right.  Wall-E's politics got in the way of my enjoyment.The `message' of Wall-E is strangely not so much about human greed destroying the planet (although that message certainly looms large in the basic plot) but about non-stop consumerism destroying human relationships.  That message (if we want to give what could be art a message) is wonderful.  It's not a cookie-cutter moral only focused on us destroying the planet.  (We've seen that since Fern Gully in 1992, and probably earlier.)  This film goes so far as to speak to the way that overconsumption destroys our human connections with one another.  And it's right.But what about the mouthpiece?  Wall-E is an anti-consumerist message from the Walt Disney Corporation, a message which cost $120M and which was made solely in order to earn another $500M or more domestically.  This movie, which begins and ends on an Earth covered almost entirely with junk, is certain to continue to fill the earth's landfills with cheap plastic movie tie-ins.  And while I wrestled with whether I should just accept the basic message, with which I basically agreed, while disregarding the corporate juggernaut of a messenger, ultimately there was a line that Disney crossed.  There at the very end of the credits ran this ad: ""In stores now on your favorite gaming systems.""--------------------------------This also seems to be the best place to review the short at the beginning of the film, ""Presto"".  As a die-hard Looney Tunes fan, I admit I get skeptical any time a Disney cartoon stars a rabbit.  In this case, my initial skepticism was justified.  As the short progressed, I was reminded that there actually is a Bugs Bunny cartoon in which Bugs works his revenge on a magician who is using him in his act.  And it's much better than this.

However, I had no idea what digital copy meant but it involves downloading the full movie from the disney (?)/pixar website. There are three cds enclosed and the one with the movie is just a prompted internet disc that takes you to enter your code found on the box. If I had to purchase this movie again I would never buy the digital copy not only because it is wasteful which is ironically what the movie speaks against (mass consumption) but because it is a pain in the neck to have to wait for a movie to download if you have a slower than normal internet connection. As for the movie....again, my family (3 year old and 2 year old boys who aren't hooked into the brain-draining television habits I was as a kid, thank god) really loved this but when there are hundreds of cheap plastic toys devoted to the movie that acts or could act as a harbinger of the fate of our consumerist society I am aghast at how no one is shouting ""STOP CONSUMING...don't you get the movie's message at all?!!!"""	3.0	Disappointed	2009-01-18	0	0	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1129LM24YWSZV	"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw"""	"This movie is absolutely precious.Here's the basic concept: Sometime in the future, humans' greedy consumerist ways and blatant disregard for the environment catches up to them. The human race is forced to abandon Earth to live on giant floating spacecraft. However, they leave an army of ""cleaning"" robots, called WALL-Es, behind to clean up the planet. The idea is that, once the robots finish their work, the humans can return to a nice, shiny planet.We quickly see, however, that even hundreds of years later, the planet isn't really clean. Towers of neatly compacted garbage are everywhere, and most of the WALL-Es have broken down, save one, the hero of our tale. Little WALL-E still gets up every morning and compacts garbage all day long, but he also sifts through the refuse for items of interest, which he takes back to the little home he's made for himself. WALL-E loves show tunes. But most of all, WALL-E is lonely.Everything changes for our little metallic friend when EVE, a drone robot from one of the floating spacecraft, returns to Earth to see if the planet can once again support life. (Allowing humans to return and repopulate the Earth.) It's pretty much love at first sight for WALL-E, and things get even more complicated when Eva does, indeed, find evidence that it's time for a wayward race to return home.Even though the concept of the movie is a little preachy, the story is brilliantly executed. For a film in which there's hardly any dialogue until more than halfway through, you feel amazingly connected to and vested in the robotic characters, primarily because they seem to exhibit more humanity than some of the flesh and blood folks. Kids would love it, but parents will really enjoy it, too. Truly a film appropriate for the whole family."	5.0	Heart-warming. Entertaining and appropriate for the entire family.	2009-06-13	4	3	1

The only green Disney is interested in is money.The packaging is made of very thin cardboard that offers no plastic spindle to hold the discs securely in place. The main movie disc is held in place by a single flap on the side and the additional discs are inserted in slots directly contacting the cardboard. My brand new Wall-e DVD skipped on three different players and at the same places each time. At first, I thought the skipping was caused by scratches from the cheap packaging but my research leads me to believe that the skipping problems are caused by the copy protection scheme.The digital copy is useless because from my understanding, the copy code expires, you can only download it once and it is crippled by Digital Rights Management (DRM) which limits your playing choices and prevents you from moving it to another computer. Hmmmm, what if I buy a new computer? No thanks.The movie was good except that it reminded me of Johnny 5 in Short Circuit but I did find the portrayal of the super-sized people to be rather amusing and somewhat life-like.

Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-Ray.

Since Blu-Ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2VK365XEVCYC8	One More Option	"Sometimes we learn to repair ourselves.Sometimes it takes external forces to repair us.I didn't expect to cry while watching Pixar's new film ""WALL-E"" today, but I did a couple times.  Pixar continues to keep making great films.  I give it 5 out of 5 stars.Here are some of the ideas I implied from watching it:We're defined by the memories we keep and the memories we share with others.Some of our greatest assets are the memories we save and share.Some of the best parts of us are things we have not created by ourselves.Some of the best parts of us are the quality recycled parts of others that we've gathered along the way and incorporated into ourselves.You could live in the best place in the universe, but if you are alone, you are alone.You could live in the worst place in the universe, but if you are with others working with you, you can create the best of worlds.We are defined by who we've allowed to hold our hand.We are defined by those who have chosen to stay beside us during difficult times.For many of us, our primary directive is not simply to pursue promoting a purpose or a place, but also to promote the pleasures of people close to us and in our community.-Stepping back and looking at the broader metaphors and themes of the primary characters in this story:Wall-E was a robot programmed and built to gather everyone else's garbage by consuming it, taking it inside himself, then compacting it into a smaller box.  With such a narrow build design and purpose, most, if not all of the other Wall-E robots fell apart and ceased to exist.  Seeing the arc of their existence as simple garbage collectors who then shaped their refuse blocks in to orderly piles and walls (hence the name ""Wall-E""), the Wall-E droids eventually died off as they stayed within their initially programmed purpose and did not learn to adapt and repair themselves.Wall-E, at some point in his existence, took on broader purposes and followed his curiosities, becoming a collector of the best parts of whatever he admired in what others had thrown away or left behind.  He found value in what others considered worthless and disposable.  And instead of following his programmed directives and crushing everything he encountered into smaller boxes for disposal, he decided to separate out and save any items he encountered that showed signs of caring and ingenuity.Instead of simply gathering and breaking things down into smaller and uniform boxes to fashion larger groups of boxes and boundaries, the cognitive breakthrough Wall-E discovered was this:  He could do more than simply box and compartmentalize.  Instead of simply following his basic programming, he instead taught himself how to filter and preserve.  He taught himself how to create new and functional items from what others considered to be old and disposable.In a world of loneliness, he became a preserver of the best qualities of cleverness, engineering, resilience, and love.  He collected fire, color, song, self-growing plants, indominable bugs, costumes, shiny objects, puzzles, dance, imagery, and everything else that might someday help others to recreate a new and beautiful world out of the world he knew was dying around him . . .. . .a world he knew he could not rebuild better alone and on his own.Wall-E realized he too would crumble and become disposed if he did not regularly re-create parts of himself, protect himself, and protect the best parts of others he discovered along the way.Eve, a representation of feminine intelligence, power, determination, investigativeness, nurturing, and creation, comes along looking for signs of healthy and natural life.  When she finds it, she takes it inside herself, protects it inside of her with a hardened and narrow resolve, like an egg shell around a growing embryo.The intelligence of both characters is revealed as they adapt to the needs of everyone around them and take on more and broader purposes than the simpler and basic purposes for which they were originally programmed and designed."	5.0	Some Of Us Are Better Now Because We Have Been Broken, We Have Fallen Apart, And We Have Been Repaired So Many Times In Our Past	2008-08-16	22	19	3
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AHF97M45JFCB	ONENEO	"WALL-E is about the most unconventional animated feature film you will likely ever encounter.  It's strange, it's moving, it's powerful, and it's pretty darn spectacular.  Realistically speaking, this shouldn't come as much of a surprise considering this is big-budget Pixar/ Disney all the way, was done by the director of Finding Nemo, and boarded by the creative storytellers behind Cars and Ratatouille.By now you've read that there is bare minimum dialog in this picture and it is the first of its kind to integrate live-action segments with computer generated imagery.  It's set in the distant future on a nearly unrecognizable earth and humanity, in an evolved state of disability no less, doesn't even make an appearance till the latter portion of the film.  A majority of the lead character's interaction exists between a silent robot and a cockroach and yet despite these areas (or perhaps because of them), WALL-E delivers heart-warming entertainment in spades.The plot takes place approximately seven hundred years in the future, and finds the earth over-run with garbage/ devoid of plant and animal life; the consequence of years of environmental degradation and thoughtless consumerism.Humans, apparently having run themselves right off the globe, are now living on a self-sustaining spacecraft known as the Axiom after vacating Earth some centuries earlier. The plan, it seems, was for humans to vacate the planet temporarily while cleaning robots prepared the earth for re-colonization. However, after seven hundred years of working tirelessly in a harsh environment, all of the robots have deteriorated and broken down except for a single small cleaning robot, a ""Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class"" to be exact: WALL-E.WALL-E spends his days compacting trash into solid blocks and building massive structures out of these cubes to await removal by harvester robots that are no longer operational. The film flawlessly displays the reality that the lonesome little robot collects some of the more interesting artifacts he uncovers in the trash and keeps them in the back of a broken down truck that serves as his home. At night he watches a clip of ""Hello Dolly"" he recovered through a VCR he wired to an iPod with dreams of sharing his weird little world with someone, anyone else.His life makes a remarkable change after countless years of loneliness when an enormous spacecraft touches down and deposits another, much more advanced robot, EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator).Nominated for and winner of dozens of awards, Wall-E manages to depict more heart and elicit more emotion for its speech impaired title character than a majority of modern dialog-rich motion pictures combined.  Due to the combination of near-flawless pacing, direction that blends photo realistic backdrops with lovely character models, and a sound score (including effects by Ben Burrtt), WALL-E harkens back to capture a feel that can only be compared to some of the soaring achievements of early silent films.About the only complaint to the entire film that may resonate some consideration is that young children may find the entire premise/ presentation a bit too tedious for their rapid-fire attention spans.  This is a film that relishes subtleties of the human condition over slapstick or abundant humor attempts.  A certain level of maturity is expected to fully appreciate the prose, meaning older kids and adults will find much to love here.Even going into WALL-E with enough hype to raise even the humblest of expectations to the point of disappointment, I still came away amazed at how well Pixar has mastered the subtleties of capturing emotion in their works.  Considered the founders of the whole computer generated animation movement, it's evident with each Pixar production that remaining the leader of the genre is no fluke."	4.0	Pixar Raises the Bar with a Lovable Little Cube	2010-09-03	0	0	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A11NTMRUK52NAK	"OoOoOoO ""OoOoOoO"""	Wall-E is a surprisingly dark production, with hidden depths of meaning and cultural references.Rather unexpected, seeing as its produced by Pixar, owned by Disney, and marketed as a ''kiddie'' show.Consider these:-(1) Wall-E has tens of thousands of other colleagues, all dead. He's the last one left 'alive'.  How does he manage it?  He survives by scavanging spareparts from his dead colleagues. I.e. he's conceptually a cannibal.  But driven to cannibalism in order to survive.  Very dark and gloomy.(2)  Then you ask yourself,  why did all his colleagues died, and why only Wall-E survived?  He has become different - i.e. he MUTATED. And the source of of his difference must be 'faulty' or non-standard programming. He must have mutated, became different from his original \ programming, so he learnt how to survive by scavanging, self-repair, and finding shelter against the ravages of weather and nature.  His mutation is also shown by his ''deviant'' behaviour of starting a memorabilia / musuem like collection of trinkets significant to himself.(3)  He watches old musicals on an old VSH videoplayer somehow patched into an i-Pod.  More evidence of his mutation.  Note that there is no evidence that any other of his colleagues indulges in such behaviour (nor for that matter, survived long enough to develop a behaviourial pattern like that).(4)  At another level, the tale of Wall-E is also the 'Adam and Eve' Biblical story rehashed / transposed into an alternative future setting.  Wall-E is the innocent, 'male'.  Eva the svelt, powerful, high-tech, simultaneouly threatening and seductive personification of the eternal Siren.(5) Eva brought back to Axiom (in a womb-like receptacle in her torso) evidence of life, thus Eva represents the life-bringer/bearer female principle.(6)  However, Eva's 'gift' or message is a highly dangerous one, because it threatens the very existence of the highly automated ''idyllic'' lifestyle mankind has apparently achieved for themselves in Axiom.  Thus, Eva is both the Eve-Tempress, and Pandora's box, rolled into one.  Eva is the bearer of news that will destroy mankind's idyllic, Paradise-like innocent existence.  In a word, Eva IS the forbidden fruit, bearing a message of death & destruction disguised as hope.(7)  Eva's gift seduces the current Captain of Axiom into launching a mistaken, idealized quest to return all his passengers to Earth.  Surely this is a descent into Hell.  All the passengers onboard Axiom are so urbanized, spoilt and decadent that exposure to Earth's environment and a forcible return to an agrarian economy would likely cause very high rates of death.(8)  ''Auto'' - the Hal-9000 like figure of Axiom - is portrayed as a villain, trying to cover-up and deny Eva's message.  But really, was he the villain, or just Virtue mis-portrayed ?  Or he was just trying to save Paradise from being destroyed, preventing humanity from being cast out of Paradise?  Of all protagonists in the show, Auto seems to be the only one conscious of the destruction that would surely await the passengers of Axiom once they return to Earth.  Did that occur to any of us watching the show? Wall-E may be cute, but my favourite character is ''Auto''.Why do I like Auto? In terms of idea and archetypes, Auto's the ancient mythic Dragon-character (horoscopically I am a Dragon), guarding jealously a treasure - in this case the treasure is the sole surviving example of high civilization and his trusteeship of millions of obese, helpless child-like humans, dependant every minute of their hapless pampered existence on Auto's comprehensive 5-Star-Hotel like everything-catered-for ''Room service can I help you?'' environs.''Auto'' for me personifies and represents duty, loyalty to duty, and self-sacrifice. He operates under a severe burden - of the knowledge that Earth has died, and the conditions then would be utterly fatal to his naive human charges (the Captain thinks pizzas grow on trees furgawdsakes!!). As such, he has the almost unbearable burden of continuing the cruise indefinitely into the future.Auto is a tragic-hero figure, tragically miscast in the role of a villain just because he's the only protagonist in the movie realizing that a return to Earth (not your ideal sylvian Garden of Eden even in its state today in 2009!) would easily cause 99% of his passengers to die horribly of disease and famine, and he heroically ACTS on that realization - by attempting to cover up Eva's message of doom. I luuuurve 'Auto'. Duty and Loyalty are his watchwords. On the altar of servitude and duty, he sacrificed even his perceived 'virtue' and comes across as a heartless, obsessive villain.	5.0	Excellent Story hiding surprising depth and unexpected darkness	2009-02-05	0	0	0

"This is honestly the most entertaining and heart filled piece that Pixar has done to date, with not only laughter and adventure but also romantic elements that actually WORK!Now, I'll admit that I loved Toy Story, but before this that was Pixar's high point. Movies like Cars even fell back on bad cliches and gender stereotypes, but with Wall-E comes EVE who is a powerfull female (Yes I know she's a robot but the female symbolism is obvious) figure and an actual driving force in the plot. For once we have a female who's more than a mere accessory to her male counterpart, she has a personality all her own! Let's hope Pixar keeps this up and we don't see any more ""little Bo Peep"" type women from their features anymore!The soundtrack is great and original, falling back more on classics than new songs. It works and works well, adding to romantic moments or lonely ones.Now the only downer is the humans, they're stupid, bumbling, and complacent.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2MAB5Q4XA209W	"Patrick Shepherd ""hyperpat"""	Once again, it would seem that Pixar has created what may be the best movie of the year, in any genre. At the very least, it should rank as the best animated flick of the year. If you haven't seen it yet, rectify that situation immediately, and take your grandmother and grandson with you. I guarantee that you will end up laughing and crying at the same time, and your $10 will have been well spent.First off, this really is a science fiction movie. It does exactly what sf should do: imagine the continuation of some current trends and looks at the results. It starts with the concept that humans have made a real trash-heap out of the Earth, so bad that neither humans nor anything else can live there anymore. What's left of humanity has exited, stage-left, in giant luxury space-ships, to await the time that the clean-up robots they've left behind will have finished cleaning up the place. Wall-E is one such robot, the last one left that's still operational, and his daily work is picking up all the trash laying around, compacting it into cubes, and stacking up the cubes - which by the time this movie opens form skyscrapers. The picture that is painted is a depressing one, not just because we can see just how badly humans have treated their home world, but because we can see just how much is still left to do, with only one little robot there to accomplish the task. Not a standard start for what is in essence a romantic comedy.The comedy of this movie is not forced, nor is it a parody playing on other sf films, asGalaxy Questdoes. Instead it creates its own environment, and the comedy derives from the bitter-sweet circumstances of a very lonely Wall-E. The only other living thing he has as a companion is a cockroach (which does play on some long-ago statements that such insects would be the last survivors of a world catastrophe). His off-time is spent viewing old romantic movies and collecting and studying various interesting bits of trash, such as a Rubick's cube. Wall-E is beat up, rusty, getting by by scavenging spare parts from other, now non-functional, Wall-Es - a Charlie Chaplin figure down on his luck. So the attraction he feels for Eve, a sleek, modern robot sent back to Earth by what's left of humanity to determine if conditions have improved enough to return, is immediate and very understandable. His clumsiness in trying to show his affection is both touching and truly funny.The plot continues to unfold in true science fiction fashion, as we see what has become of humanity after seven hundred years of floating around in their luxury space-ship, with every need instantly gratified by ubiquitous servant robots. And this is done without long voice-overs (in fact, there is very little real dialog in the entire movie, and it's rather incredible just how much is communicated without all the words), but rather with some very effective visuals that explain instantly how things got to be the way they are today. There's some definite satire lurking behind some of these scenes, pillorying past Presidents, some other movies, and certain very large corporations.Even better, the science is real. There is one sequence where Wall-E jets around in space by using the propulsive action of a fire extinguisher bottle - a sequence that, while not having the majesty of the shuttle docking to a space station of2001 - A Space Odyssey, shows the consequences of Newton's third law in an amusing, beautiful, and highly effective manner.It's very rare to find Hollywood script writers who understand what science fiction is all about, and even rarer for them to able to combine such ideas with comedy and romance without making a mess of things. This one does it. If this doesn't take at least the Hugo for best movie, and several Oscars, something is very wrong.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)	5.0	Wall-E, Intrepid Trash Collector	2008-07-03	10	7	3

Though in actuality, the highest and most accurate praise I can give this humble little film is this: It's not only the best animated feature sinceThe Lion King, it also earns an easy place as one of the top five animated films of all time.Wall-E balances an innocent romance with a story about realization, companionship, and heroism in a way that will both entertain and challenge children, all the while completely engaging adults in both the story and the potent but never pushy social message. The movie manages multiple laugh out loud moments with minimal dialogue, and instead allows the robots to communicate with each other and humans with robotic sounds that are so well done that they're as understandable as any real speech used in the movie.  The lead robots, Wall-E and EVE are great characters with a story that can and will warm your heart and glaze your eyes one minute and make you crack up the next.  There are hardly any B-Plots except recurring jokes (the ""Foreign Contaminate"" robot bit comes to mind), so pretty much the full length of the movie is devoted to Wall-E's epic journey to restore humanity on Earth and, moreover, to hold EVE's hand.The design of the robots in this movie is nothing short of genius.  They are highly emotive and more expressive than most of the humans, though it's clear that Pixar made the effort to achieve a balance, making sure that they're expressive but also retain the man-made machinery look.  And it was a complete success.  There are many scenes of simple staggering beauty here, such as Wall-E, fire extinguisher in hand, flying with EVE through open space.  From the regular character design, to the deep and starry sky, to the buildings, to the fast paced action scenes, to the sleek look of EVE, to the masterpiece that is Wall-E himself, Pixar completely and totally outdid themselves.Wall-E is an ambitious idea that has been fully realized in an unabashed masterpiece of a film.10/10 Classic."	5.0	A Work of Staggering, Simple Beauty	2008-11-18	4	4	0

"The commercials advertising ""Wall-E"" told relatively nothing about the story, and for good reason: there isn't much of a ""story"", aside from the lead robot's attempting to find the ""female"" robot it fancies. This ""movie"" is less of a movie and more of a political propaganda film. If one is a tree-hugging environmentalist, one would thoroughly enjoy this film. However, if one is like me--completely averse to global warming and other such leftist myths--one would abhor this film.

Now please note that although I am in Australia, I have bought dozens of DVDs from Amazon, 100% of which I have been able to view without problems on my computer, using either Power DVD or Windows Media Player. This Wall-E 3 Disc Edition, however, will not run at all on my computer, not on Power DVD or Windows Media Player. All it does is cycle through all the chapters in a few seconds, and then returns to the menu. To add injury to insult, Disc 3, the digital copy of the movie, when I type in the redemption code, mocks me by saying that I don't live in the USA, so my registration is invalid. I am not aware of any such warning mentioned in the sales blurb. Conclusion: good movie, completely flawed product. The only part that worked was the Disc 2, the extras.

I knew going in that it was a kid's movie, obviously, but Pixar can usually entertain adults as well as they can kids (I think The Incredibles is a perfect example.) but after about 50 minutes I just lost interest and could barely keep my eyes open; the only reason for not falling asleep is the beautiful Roger Deakins inspired visuals.I think my problem with Wall-E is it's too simple, not as complex as The Incredibles or as interesting as Toy Story.  There are some messages here and there (we're fat and lazy, we're not paying attention to anything other than what is immediately in front of our face.) but these themes are so base and simple that I felt like the people behind the scenes had no faith in their adult viewers.It's not anti-anything, really, and it's not an ad for Al Gore, that's obvious to anyone with a brain, it's simply a kid's movie with sparse and cookie cutter messages.	2.0	Better than Ratatouille, which isn't saying much; not nearly as brilliant as Toy Story; too cute for its own good	2008-07-29	39	5	34

If Disney is compelled to politicize their movies then the movies should be provided to the public at no cost as is the case with other political media.Also, are we the only ones who recognized the plot to be interestingly close to that of the Movie ""Silent Running"" starring Bruce Dern?

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AXV9GS0TMSVW	Poor Napoleon	"Wall-E, like Cars didn't convince me when I saw the previews.  It was a robot movie.  Robots and CGI go hand in hand and the initial idea seemed to lack the inspiration Pixar had become known for.  But like Cars, the Pixar crew can take what seems to be a dull topic and lace it with excellent storytelling, brilliant chracterization, and this one gets the added bonus of providing social commentary.  That they can do all this and still make it appeal to kids is a feat - one that Pixar has been successful at since their first foray into feature films.First of all, this is one of Pixar's most visually satisfying features.  It has to be.  The first 30 minutes or so of the film feature one sole character - Wall-E - and his limited dialogue, which is pretty much uttering his name.  He picks up trash from an abandoned Earth.  The ugly setting in and of itself provides exposition.  The earth has been trashed.  Signs on earth show how a corporate giant had a part in the pollution.  Through Wall-E's actions, we discover he is very creative with the trash, collecting little trinkets, even if he's not sure how it's used.  There's a certain bit of emotion he finds in an old recording of ""Hello Dolly.""  In a rarity for Pixar, they marry some little bits of live action.  The movie shifts as Eve, another robot, comes to earth in search of vegetation to see if it's at all inhabitable.That a movie with so little dialogue has such emotional depths and is so thought provoking says something about the talent at Pixar.  Much has to be credited with the wonderful visual presentation of the film, clearly painting landscapes of earth and of the spaceship where those who evacated earth inhabit, slaves to a lazy consumer culture.  Amazingly, with all the social commentary, the film doesn't talk over kids' heads.  Far beyond being just great artists, the folks at Pixar are also great storytellers. This film harks back to the themes of Finding Nemo and it definitely posesses that film's heart.This is probably the first Pixar film that has social overtones.  Indeed the film is indictment on what people are doing to the environment and while some of the imagery is broad and funny (people in the future have become lazy and fat, and there are a lot of sight gags portraying it), it's actually a pretty sad future that is painted here. It's delivered tactfully and while adults will pick on the subtle themes and stabs at pop culture, kids should be able to watch this film and pick up and be encouraged to discuss these films.  In a feat for Disney, this one actually teaches social responsibility.  But aside from that, it's one of Pixars best achievements to date."	5.0	Surprisingly one of Pixar's best	2008-11-11	5	4	1

My husband and I took my younger cousins to see this movie, because we just couldn't pass up sharing the wonderful story and the many lessons that came with it.  It seems everything made for kids today is centered around brainwashing them to consume more, to encourage them to throw away anything that is out of date or no longer ""in"", and does nothing to encourage them to pursue helping their fellow man.  This movie addressed so many problems today from our cradle to grave economy, the fact that we WILL live in the trash and filth we create, and ""things"" don't create happiness or make you feel alive.

The scenes of the endless piles of trash were reminiscent of a documentary I saw on wasteTRASHED.Raging dust storms, a space mall for heavy Americans to amuse themselves to death, and questions of robots taking over society are among the other dark topics of this film; which, amazingly, remains funny and offers a hopeful message.

Wall*E is able to continue to evolve culturally due to the artifacts (Hello Dolly video) left behind by humans eight hundred years before the earth became uninhabitable. Wall*E is an endearing and likeable character, as is Eve.Wall*E collects artifacts and learns to be, well, human, perhaps more human than the actual species who takes the name.Wall*E is also about the history of culture, particularly art.If you walk out during the credits you will have missed one of Wall*E's most important messages.Wall*E the film asks some interesting questions:What is the essence of the human species: our culture?What remains, when all is said and done?Following the film Wall*E, What remains is culture. What we leave behind may be film, works of literature, music, ideas.Wall*E may indeed be one of those works of humanity that last another eight hundred years.	5.0	Wall*E is a Wonderful and Thoughtful Film!	2008-07-21	4	3	1

Seriously, from the first moment I saw a trailer for this, I knew my family & I had to see it. This is an EXCELLENT movie in every single way. Wonderfully positive messages for all of us are laced throughout the movie, which is something I greatly value in these types of movies, plus it's just a fantastic movie to watch for entertainment purposes.This movie has so much heart, I still feel Wall*E's hold on my heartstrings, I think it's permanent, and that is lovely. It is an interesting & topical story to start off with, a clear message on our environmental footprint and what the future could hold should our behaviors go unchecked. It is also a wonderful comment on respect and reverence for 'life' in all its myriad of forms, of working together, of love & companionship, of personal courage and standing up for what you believe in, no matter the odds stacked against you. I think, for me, its most powerful message is one that is echoed in other great stories (such as Lord of the Rings, for example) - that no one is too small, too ""insignificant"", to make a great impact on all of our lives. There is great power for positive change in the unlikeliest of beings.Funny, sweet, touching, exciting, memorable.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AV1GOWAM0BBT3	R. A. Jones	At one level, Wall-E is a classic story of an awkward poor boy who meets a beautiful, classy lady and somehow manages to win her heart. Sounds easy. But look what they were working with: A pair of binoculars mounted on a tracked box and an egg with only a dark panel and a couple of blue spots for a face. Yet after only a few minutes on the screen, Wall-E and EVE are completely natural, believable, and appealing characters.On another level, the animation is nothing short of incredible. From the rust spots and paint chips to the minute parts of moving mechanisms, the detail is mind-boggling. They even used depth of field and lens flare to make the film look as though it was shot with a camera, instead of being generated by computers. The only down side to Wall-E is the standard it sets for others (or even Pixar) to have to meet with future work. This film isn't just classic animation, it stands alone.The shorts are impressive too. Presto is a classic slapstick cartoon brought into the digital age, and Burn-E, the hapless little welding robot that hums Beethoven's Ninth while he works is a great sidebar to the main film. Both are cute, funny, and like Wall-E, spectacularly well done.The Blu-Ray disk worked flawlessly in my Sony player, and the quality of the image is superb.	5.0	Great story, stunning animation	2009-06-04	3	2	1

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI	"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan"""	"It's a testimony to Disney-Pixar's talents that they can tell a story with minimal dialogue (true...the first half hour is dialogue free until humans enter the story). Creating one of the most original ideas in animation and imbueing it with charm & imagination, ""WALL-E"" is a futuristic story of a scrappy but cute robot who's on Earth for one reason: To ""clean up"" the mess left behind by mankind after the environment becomes completely unliveable. With a spright cockroach as his pet (it figures that roaches would survive anything) and finding solace viewing old movie musicals, WALL-E's life goes on uneventfully. That is, until a massive mother ship lands & deposits an advanced model robot named EVE. Initially hostile, EVE gradually befriends the curious robot, and sort of a romance ensues. But then, EVE completes her mission, and the mother ship returns to whisk her away, with a lovesick WALL-E as stowaway. What follows is an imaginative string of adventures as WALL-E inadvertently creates comic havoc on the ship. It's slowly revealed that this is a colony ship...except the corporate company who sponsors it (Buy 'n Large) has created sort of a ""cruise ship paradise"" in which automation has made its human guests obese & physically soft. When evidence reveals that plant life can be regrown to make Earth habitable again, there follows a power struggle between the ship's captain & the controlling robots serving him.As mentioned, since there was minimal dialogue, the voice talent is minimal: Jeff Garlin voices the captain, Sigourney Weaver supplies the ship's computer voice, and you'll even hear John Ratzenberger (who's done nearly every Disney-Pixar venture). There's a cautionary message about the dangers of humanity relying too heavily on technology, and of course, a strong message about wasting our natural resources. But at the heart is that great animation (showing every little ding & scratch on WALL-E) and superior storytelling.The DVD extras included commentary, deleted scenes, the riotously funny short ""Presto"", as well as a new short, ""BURN-E"". Definitely one to add to the Disney collection!"	5.0	Charming and astounding	2011-02-17	1	1	0

Wall-E simply captures and perfectly evokes the idea of love between two beings and shows both the sweetness and heartfelt emotion that are found in an ideal love story. The devotion that Wall-E shows to EVE and what she returns to him are among some of the most beautiful ever filmed.The movie has a number of funny and downright hysterical parts to it and we even can see a number of aspects of screwball comedy in the story line.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A21SKWLWGMHV13	Real Consumer	The movie is pretty good, though I'd of rather seen them spend the time and money this took to produce on Toy Story 3 or even Cars 2 instead. There's basically no dialog in this movie, which would make it great for little kids around 2 to 3 yrs of age, yet it lacks any color for such young kids so the story for the most part comes in a little boring. Don't get me wrong, it's still a must own movie for kids, I just thought Toy Story 1 and 2 and Cars were so much better. I was expecting something equal to or greater than these movies and it greatly disappointed.My real reason for this review though was my absolute disappointment in the cheap packaging. It's not even in a regular DVD case, it comes in a cheap cardboard package! A movie for kids in a package that can't even survive adults, let alone children. I thought this was a great price, now I see why. I'd of been much happier paying the $4 higher local retail price and received the movie in an actual plastic DVD case than this.

He's never asked me to buy him something, so I pressed for more information.  I assumed it was one of his Thomas engines, but he told me Wall-E is a robot.  His mom and I were surprised he even knew about the movie, but being the over-indulgent grandmother I am, I ordered it as soon as I got home and had it sent one day!  The next day my daughter supplied the back story.  She was out at a meeting the night before I was there.  It seems he and his dad went and rented Wall-E.  They watched it that night and he really watched it - something unusual for an active 3yo.  The next day, on the way to school, his dad stopped to return the movie.  The little guy had a royal melt down.  ""No! You can't take away MY Wall-E!""  His dad tried to appease him by saying they might buy a copy since he liked it so much.  He responded, ""Grandma will buy it for me.""I tell this story so if anyone wonders if it is a good movie for young children, the answer is a resounding, ""Yes!""  I was staying with him today and had my first opportunity to watch the movie.  He's seen it many times by now.  He still sat there wrapped up in the story.  He'd ask a question every now and then, but I had to remind him he's seen it, I haven't!  It is a very well done story.  There is little dialog with a lot of the story carried in the soundtrack.  I enjoyed the use of one of my favorite movie musicals - Hello Dolly.  There are some anxiety producing sections (I'm sensitive to that thanks to Lassie, Bambi, and The Wizard of Oz), but they aren't so bad they might cause nightmares.

Usually when I bring my son to his movies, I just hope that it is entertaining enough that I can sit through it.  This movie had me glued to the screen the whole way through, and I am actually looking forward to buying it on dvd.  The tale is of a future earth that became so trash filled and polluted that mankind has left for the stars leaving behind the mess and a trash compacting robot whose only job is to try and clean up the mess.  Though he does have a roach for a friend, Wall-e is quite lonely and a bit eccentric after all those hundreds of years by himself.  When a probe robot is sent to earth to look for signs of returning life, Wall e finds himself falling in love.  Though there is minimal dialog, the actions of the robots speak much louder.  The animators really did a phenomenal giving such expression to Wall-e's robot face.  The whole movie really shines.  The short film with the magician and the rabbit was hysterical and a great kick off to the feature.  Reminded me of the classic Bugs Bunny shorts.

However, the product packaging itself and the way in which Amazon fulfilled this order leaves a lot to be desired. This product was described as being new and sold by Amazon. The product I received, however, was badly beat up and has a Wal-Mart sticker on the front. The movie case itself is in good shape and is shrinkwrapped, but the cardboard sleeve is chipped, bent and looks like it's been in a kid's movie collection for the past several years and not sitting on a shelf, in New-In-Box condition. I don't regret my purchase since the movie itself is fantastic, but for the price, I'd expect the packaging to be better and product description to be reflective of what the customer will actually receive.	3.0	Great movie.

Sure I recognized that it was the most beautiful animated film ever made at the time, but the story didn't resonate with me. I wasn't moved by an impossible robot love story. A couple of years later, going against my memory of an unimpressive film, I decided to go ahead and buy it anyway. After watching it a second time, it was a completely new experience. The message this film has for the modern world of consumers is simply amazing, and necessary. No matter how much people may want to deny that we are destroying our planet, the repercussions are becoming more and more apparent. This movie is an animated family film, right? Most Pixar films are not that simple. WALL-E gave us a glimpse of a future that none of us should want to see come to fruition. The whole robot love story was amazing as well. The heft of the environmental message is so heavy, that it's easy to overlook the love story. I appreciate this film now that I am an older, more mature film enthusiast. What a difference graduating High School can make.Plus there are Sci-Fi references galore throughout the film. Most obvious being 2001: A Space Odyssey. I'm not a fan of Stanley Kubrick's ""Masterpiece"", but I loved the homage WALL-E paid to it. WALL-E is almost perfect. The Blu-ray transfer is top notch as well. This goes without saying, but Pixar is by far the most consistent studio making movies today. As far as films, and transfers go.

Wall-E, who was designed as a trash compactor, seems to be the only moving thing on a dead Earth besides a cockroach.  Wall-E labors each day, gathering trash and crushing into blocks which he's used to build towers as high as some of the remaining skyscrapers.Along comes Eve, a sleek egg-shaped robotess who's been sent out to find life.  Being a romantic at heart after quietly absorbing old movies for centuries, Wall-E falls immediately in love.When Eve discovers plant life, everything changes.  She sends a signal to the Mother Ship, which picks her up and is about to destroy her for contaminants.  Then, the Captain and some of the humans are awakened and get into the act.If you love Charades or Guesstures, you're going to have a lot of fun with this movie.  Dialogue's been replaced by subtle and sometimes heart-rending gestures between the mostly robotic cast.For the most part, the children in the audience seemed captivated.  ""Wall-E"" moved at a smart enough pace to keep the whining and wiggling down to a minimum.  The characters were interesting; however, I felt like Wall-E was pretty derivative of Johnny 5 from ""Short Circuit"" (who I enjoyed more) and Eve reminded me a lot of the well-rounded fem-bot from ""The Jetsons"" albeit neither had as good a lines as their predecessors. (3.5 stars)The soundtrack was good. A particular favorite is Peter Gabriel's contribution, ""Down to Earth."" Other highlights were Michael Crawford's ""It Only Takes a Moment"" and Louis Armstrong's ""La Vie En Rose.""Of course, with Pixar you don't just get a movie.  The animated cartoon beforehand, ""Presto"" is the tale of a magician and the rabbit who's supposed to come out of his hat. This performing duo had me screaming with laughter and wanting ""Wall-E's"" DVD when it comes out just for the cartoon.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO	Robert Badgley	"Wall-E,Disney's high grossing entry of 2008(released June/08),is a delightful look at our future(2805) whose protagonist just happens to be a little robotic trash compactor.On the surface it would seem to be something with only slight potential,but the magical folks at Pixar transform this seemingly mundane bot into something with feelings,something with dedication to his job and his charge(a cockroach!),endless determination and whose life we get caught up in and come to care about in short order.It is quite marvelous how it all unfolds.The story takes place in 2805 and Earth is a deserted wasteland...waste,being the operative word.The entire population has long left earth(over a quarter of a million days ago!)and now lives on a huge spaceship;the Axiom.People,due largely to bone loss,no longer walk but fly around on hover chairs with their every whim and need catered to by a myriad of different bots.Every so many years the ship sends out probes to Earth to determine whether life has returned so THEY may return.This is where our little rolling trash compactor by the name of Wall-E comes in.He lives in an old shipping-like container filled with many odds and ends he has collected over many years.He,along with his now non-functioning brethren,were left behind to clean up the Earth of all its' trash which forced the population to leave in the first place.He is still hard at it with a little cockroach for a companion when one of the Axioms life probes lands nearby.The ship comes and goes leaving behind a probe drone;think an egg with sleek wings!While the probe flits here and there seeking a sign of life Wall-E watches and falls in love.The probe isn't exactly discreet in its' search and is quick on the draw,disintegrating more than one object in its' way.This doesn't deter our love struck Wall-E however.When the probe(called Eve) finds life it shuts down,sends out an automatic beacon and is later picked up by the mother craft.Wall-E follows his lady love into space and back to the Axiom.At the Axiom Eve delivers her precious cargo to the Captain but there is a conspiracy afoot.It seems an old message from the president relaying a message about Earth at one point being uninhabitable has been interpreted by the bots,who literally control just about every aspect of life aboard the ship now,as a directive to NEVER return.So they try and destroy the evidence.Between a love struck Wall-E trying to help his lady love and a now newly invigorated ships Captain who realizes they must go back,they eventually quash the robotic uprising and put the Axiom on a heading for Earth.The story runs on many levels with its' obvious love story,its good against evil plot and a clear environmental message of how we must protect the Earth.The animation is visibly striking,rich in detail and life like;especially in scenes showing the vast wasteland that has become our planet.Technically the film has been transferred beautifully and is in its original widescreen a/r.Extras abound in this three disc set and they include:A Digital copy,The Pixar Story,Deleted scenes,some ""hilarious moments"" from the movie,a look at the Buy N Large Corp,""Lots of Bots""which includes games,several making of featurettes,a close look at Wall-E's friends,two animated shorts:""Burn-E"" and the theatrical short which accompanied the movie when first run,""Presto"",audio commentary by the director,a tour of the universe by Wall-E and the sounds of Wall-E.It's an extra packed edition to be sure.I do have one complaint about this three disc set however.The discs come in cardboard pull out sections;the left pull out has one disc in it(#1) and the right pull out has the other two discs,feathered over one another.When I saw this and started pulling them out to examine them I thought""Oh boy,here we go.I can see them all being scratched or scuffed"".But I was pleasantly surprised to find they were fine.However taking them in and out(especially the 2nd and 3rd ones)I think will eventually cause scuffs.So for my own peace of mind I elected to put them into a separate double holding DVD snap case.This is positively awful thinking on Disney's part to be so cavalier in how they package these things.Of course it's more money for them if you have to get new ones.So beware my friends.In conclusion this 3 DVD set of the Disney/Pixar 2008 smash Wall-E is a crowd pleaser from start to finish.The characters we see are fascinating to the nth degree and the plot moves at a good and steady pace.The animation by Pixar is top notch all the way through and is startlingly real especially in its' portrayal of Earth in the future.In this 3-disc set beware of the bad packaging that these discs are put into.If you can overcome this hurdle,sit back and relax and enjoy another wonderful adventure from the imaginative folks at Pixar studios."	4.0	Who thought a trash compactor could be fun?	2010-07-07	0	0	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	"Wall-E (Andrew Stanton, 2008)Wall-E, as I write this, is currently sitting at #26 on IMDB's Top 250, making it not only, for the moment, the most beloved Pixar film of all time (Finding Nemo, at #148, ranks second), but the most beloved animated film of all time (Spirited Away, at #58, coming in second). It also rates an almost unimaginable (given the number of reviews collected, one hundred ninety-nine) 96% at Rotten Tomatoes. Well, someone has to choke on the fishbone. I thought Wall-E was great-- when it wasn't awful.I'd thought Cars was just a bump in the road when Pixar released the infinitely superior Ratatouille the year after; Ratatouille showed Pixar still knew how to couch its social criticism in a worthwhile story and have fun with the whole mess. Now, however, I'm starting to wonder if Ratatouille is actually the bump in the road, because Wall-E brings back Cars' tired old hit-you-in-the-face-with-a-sledgehammer approach to social commentary. Oh, the stupid, it burns. And for the record, I'm not talking about the human race scooting around in jet-propelled lounge chairs, which seemed to be the focus of the scorn of the rest of the very few other critics who panned this movie; I'm talking about the even more tired ""WE'RE KILLING THE PLANET!!!oneone!!"" message that so disgusted me about Happy Feet, and that it seems one cannot make a kids' movie today without bowing to. (Except, of course, for Ratatouille, and, um, everything Pixar did previous to Cars-- you know, back when Pixar knew how to make movies, not animated political statements.)But, you know, I could have dealt with that had the entire movie been like the first half-hour, which was an exercise in one-man film. Two-man film is always an intriguing thing, and more often than not it works like gangbusters (My Dinner with Andre, Closetland, most of Hard Candy), but one-man film is something most moviemakers wouldn't even dare to try. Everyone who's tried to adapt I Am Legend? Yeah, like that. Pixar shows, conclusively, that you can do it in the first half-hour of Wall-E, which depicts Wall-E and his pet cockroach going about their daily business-- building bricks of garbage and forming them into high-rises that tower over the tallest buildings in what looked suspiciously like an animated version of New York City. Wall-E is the last of his kind; we see hundreds of other garbage collectors that have broken down in the scenery. (Wall-E keeps himself running by cannibalizing parts from the dead guys. If this were a live-action movie, folks, Disney wouldn't go anywhere near it.) Wall-E has also developed a personality, and a liking for odd things; he has a collection of butane lighters, for example. So when, in the shell of a refrigerator, he finds a small green shoot, he digs it up, sticks it in an old boot, and takes it back to his hangar. Pay attention, because that shoot is the lynchpin on which the entire rest of the movie turns. However, if I get any farther into it, we'll be entering spoiler territory-- though I believe I may have been the last American left who hadn't seen the movie, and I'm reviewing it a couple of weeks later. In any case, when the world Pixar had created was given to us like this, when its only context was itself, I had no problem with the obvious environmental-consciousness junk. It only surfaced when context was given to it-- a couple of brief, but blindingly anti-capitalist, scenes in the first thirty minutes, and then a more sustained attack once the film's plot gets rolling.It's going to be tough to criticize the film from here on out without getting into spoiler territory, but I'll say that the great paradox of Wall-E is that part of the reason the enviro-junk is so offensive is precisely because the rest of the plot works so very well. It's almost as if Wall-E were originally two different movies; a short film about a robot on a planet building mounds of garbage, and an updated, outer-space version of Metropolis or R. U. R.. And both of them on their own stood mighty well. It was in the intersection where things fell apart.In any case, the good stuff? I don't think I need to tell you about the good stuff, assuming you've seen a Pixar movie or two. They're the best at what they do, technically, they've got an incredible stable of voice actors, and the guys who storyboard this stuff are just as competent in the direction department as the actual director. (Not surprising; the writers here, aside from director Andrew Stanton, were Pete Docter, the director of Monsters, Inc.-- Pixar's finest moment to date-- and Jim Reardon, who's directed thirty episodes of The Simpsons.) Pixar has a vision, and when that vision works, they crank out some of the best films imaginable. When it finds a pothole, the bounce-back can kill you. ** "	3.0	Not as weak as Cars, but Pixar still has a long, long way to go to get back to the heights.	2008-08-19	18	6	12

This science fiction cartoon about a love story between two robots is very touching. Wall.e reminds people what can happen to the Earth if we don't take care of it.

The other animated short is ""Burn.e"". This is pretty fun to watch too.  The other cool bonus feature is the commentary about how sound designs are created.  It features Ben Burtt who created all the sounds for the movie.  He provides a brief interesting history about sound design in movies too.  This DVD includes two great deleted scenes that were not in the movie.  They are very entertaining to watch.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"Every time I see a Pixar film I tacitly assume that they have taken CGI about as far as it can go.  Then with their next film they prove me wrong.  (Unfortunately, with some of their upcoming films about to go 3D, I think they will -- as someone who wears glasses I have never been able to enjoy a 3D film -- the disposable spectacles are simply not made with glasses wearers in mind, and unless they come up with a solution for guys like me many of us will be unable to enjoy them.)  I find it absolutely astonishing that WALL-E is getting so many one, two, three, and four-star ratings.  Come on folks!  What else would a film need to do to be worthy of five stars?  I think the film critics are getting it right on this one.  The film is consistently being named as one of the top two or three movies of 2008, regardless of genre.  The debate is centered not on whether it is the top animated movie of 2008, but whether it will be nominated in the Best Picture or Best Animated Film category at the Oscars.  If it is nominated for Best Picture, it would stand a very good chance of winning the Oscar.The great thing about Pixar is that they keep stretching the limits of what is possible in CGI.  Although trickle down doesn't work in economics, it does work in CGI.  As Pixar developed programs with deeper and richer texturing and layering, new CGI programs are developed for special effects corporations doing work for TV series and movies.  The reason we see such stunning special effects on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA is because of cutting edge work being done by Pixar and others.  If you want to gauge just how far CGI has come, try looking at the CGI in BABYLON 5 Season One or SPACE: ABOVE AND BEYOND, both from the early nineties, and Season 3 of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  The heavily pixilated images of B5 have given way to the richly textured and infinitely more complex images of BSG.  And it is only going to get better in the future.As great as WALL-E is, the short film about a magician and his uncooperative bunny Alex is even better.  PRESTO is one of the best comic shorts ever made, right up there with Chuck Jones's great Donald Duck epic ""Duck Amuck"" or his Bugs Bunny classic ""What's Opera, Doc?""  I haven't seen such comic invention in anything since the peak of the greatest Warner Brothers cartoons.As to whether this is a movie for adults or kids, I have to add that in my limited experience with kids' opinions, they don't have much of a problem with it.  It seems to be more adults thinking that kids won't like it than kids actually disliking it.  I think the way to look at it is that the filmmakers made a movie that they would like to see.  I think it is a stunning masterpiece.  And a refreshing break from the pabulum that so many animated films are."	5.0	Pixar continues to raise the bar of what you can do with CGI	2008-12-25	1	1	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A18TSDA9ZRLKVM	"Robert S. ""geek hipster"""	Wall-E is essentially 2 films.  What both of these films share is that they're one of the most beautiful Blu Ray experiences you're likely to see right now.  This is a reference quality film for anyone with a Blu Ray player and a high def. television. It's visually stunning, at times 3D.  Pixar has really gone to town in this film using layers of texture not possible due to the earlier limitations of digital presentation. For fans of composer Thomas Newman, this is one of his tightest scores to date.Typical to Pixar, it's a heart-warmingly cute film.  But- it IS 2 films.  Film number one is a short date movie about Wall-E, who's job is cleaning up all the trash humanity has buried the planet in, ostensibly awaiting humanity's return on a somewhat cleaner world.  While Wall-E doesn't seem to be getting anywhere in his job, you can't help but empathize with him..Wall-E's wait is interrupted by the arrival of a rocket, which drops off EVE, a sleek search and survey robot.. EVE and Wall-E meet and have a series of first date moments, and it is this section of the film that this reviewer found most touching, artistic and excellent. Nearly no dialogue (which given the visual density was a nice touch), just the shorthand of comic romance, and it's very well done.It could end right there and be a nice little half hour art film...*spoliers*But at this point, EVE finds a plant, one of the specimens that Wall-E has kept in his robo-trailer home, because he 'likes' collecting things.  EVE sequesters the plant in her insides and sends a distress call for the rocket that dropped her off, and goes into a robot coma. Wall-E continues trying to play 'date' with her while she's asleep, making for a second, less-funny montage of 'moments'.Finally the rocket returns to scoop her up, Wall-E gives chase, and we get the political part of the film.The humans who've abandoned Earth 700 years earlier to let the robots clean it up have gone off in luxury starliners where they have no cares but to eat, sleep, and drift around on floating couches, texting eachother. They all suffer from obesity, low bone density, short attention spans, and apparently no clue they've trashed the planet...  the 'Ugly Americans', essentially (well, ok, it's a Pixar movie, so they're not THAT ugly). The plot tension hinges on whether not these de-evolving consumers will overcome the robots keeping them hostage and decide to do their moral 'job' and go home and help clean up the planet... which kindof voids the idea of the main character by telling us that a group of people with major life-issue work to do on themselves will abandon endless luxury and rise to the challenge of fixing a planet theyve become completely out of touch with... replacing the main character, who was perfectly suited to the task.  The message is trite and confused, and seems brutally tacked on.  It doesn't completely ruin the romantic set-up of the film, but it doesn't do much for it, either.  I'm not knocking the idea of saving the planet.. I'm knocking pushing that message with all the subtlety of a 20 minute McDonalds commercial.  It's been done better.Anyway, great visuals... no-one with a BD player should miss seeing this.	3.0	2 Films	2009-01-26	4	2	2
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1WUMTJOASEL5F	"Robert ""Supermandisco"""	I'll be blunt rather than sugar coat it. I don't like the Wall-E robot, nor his companion. They are much too cutsie as well as noisy, for silent robots sent on a mission or enduring private duties. In fact, the movie doesn't get rolling for me until we meet the captain of the ship on it's last survival trek from a demolished earth planet. The captain is far more interesting than Wall-E, and his dilemma with trying to figure the new mission of the escape ship due to a discovery of possible new plant life sample thru Wall-E is really the base of the movie. His haggling with the automatic pilot refusal to accept a new mission is also clever. It doesn't matter the condition of the crew, but just goes to show the possibilities of personnel so strapped to seats & monitors, you would think they would have sense enough to break for a gym, or look up steady nutrition to combat obesity. Regardless, it's about our unwillingness to abandon earth entirely even after it has been overrun with decay, as long as it shows the slightest hint of hope to revitalize. Animation in ship is a winner as well as soundtrack score. Define treadmill.	4.0	Wall-E and the Captain	2009-01-10	0	0	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A399695IIMZR23	"Robert Tarantino ""TSSINTMovie"""	Let me first say that I was very pleased with the technical aspect of the movie.  It rivals Kung Fu Panda and Ratatouille on that level.  There were times I thought I was watching a real robot trekking through a real landscape.  I wasn't this surprised since Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within first came out a few years back.  Pixar definitely earns high marks for not skimping.  For someone looking to add a reference quality movie to their collection, this is a must.  Hands down.With respect to the story, let me first say that I was warned the first 30 or so minutes contained very little dialogue.  That's fine, Castaway proved that if you have a good story, you don't need to say a lot.  However, once the movie started it came off as preachy and a little holier-than-thou.  To sum up, we're pigs that made a mess of our own world to the point that we have to abandon it.  We become so caught up in convenience items that we turn into stupid, fat mooshy leeches caught up in our own narcissistic world.  The only one that can save us is an endearing little robot named Wall-E.  It sounds cynical, maybe it is, but I've seen this story before.  I've always thought of Pixar as the source for entertainment for young and old.  Someone that brought something new to the table.  They did provide, but it was, in my opinion, the worst movie they've done.  That said, it's still better than most other animated movies currently available.  Now some may disagree, and that's fine, I think it's a Coke/Pepsi/ Mac/PC mentality.  So rent it first and make up your own mind.	3.0	Astounding Audio/Video ; Mediocre Story	2008-11-27	14	3	11
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3174CMYNKJDF2	Rob Goodman	This movie was given to me as a thank you gift from one of my larger corporate clients.  I heard that it had won, or was at least nominated for, an Academy Award.  The trailer looked cute.  I gave it a watch and was deeply saddened by the film.  Not so much the storyline, rather that this was supposed to be a children's film.The subplots of corporate greed and human laziness were slaps in the face.  Admittedly, we do have a massive obesity problem in this country.  Not many people care about the environment any more.  And corporate greed can be found in the headlines of major newspapers on a regular basis.  These are not themes that I think children should be confronted with in their DVDs.I was glad to see that the packaging of the DVD was environmentally friendly, however the Disney/Pixar films that I have purchased, or were given to me, since Wall-E was released on DVD have not been.  If these companies are so concerned about the environment why are they not doing more simple things like environmnentally friendly packaging.I felt the movie was heavy handed and not appropriate for children.  Spend time with your children planting a garden, teaching them to recycle, and playing games outdoors rather than sit them in front of screen to watch some movie with themes that they cannot fully understand.	1.0	An Inconvenient Truth: The Animated Version	2011-05-03	17	4	13

The film stalls and skips in my player (which plays other disks just fine).  Disney has done the film (and its fans) a major disservice by slipping the DVDs in a scratch-prone paper-board case.

I saw Wall-E when it came out in theatres, but my roommate had told me that she never saw it.  Fortunately Amazon had it!  I was really excited to watch it again and to seen my roommate's reaction.Disney and Pixar really just delivered on this movie.  Telling a story in mostly &#34;wall-eee&#34; and &#34;eevaa!&#34; is just, well, incredible. As the joke goes, &#34;Still a better love story than Twilight.&#34;  And it is.  Wall-E gives up everything he knows to help EVE, the humans realize how lame they've become, and everyone gets to come back home.  Wall-E is full of feels, laughs, and beautiful moments.  10/10 would watch again...and again!This was my first rental on Amazon and I'll definitely be renting more.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"*SPOILERS*""Wall-E,"" the latest offering from the moviemaking geniuses at Pixar Studios, is a certifiable visual masterpiece that provides an endlessly inventive vision of what life might be like in the 29th Century - although, come to think of it, the term ""life"" may be something of a misnomer, for in ""Wall-E""'s post-apocalyptic image of the future, Earth has been rendered uninhabitable by pollution and garbage that have risen to toxic levels.  The humans have long since fled to a high-tech way station located somewhere out in the far reaches of outer space, leaving the planet virtually deserted except for a sweet trash-compressing robot named Wall-E and his indestructible cockroach sidekick.  Like all good little robots, Wall-E tirelessly performs the one function he has been programmed to carry out, even after the reason for that task no longer exists.  Thus, he spends his days dutifully collecting all the litter generously strewn about the deserted city and converting it into skyscraper-high mounds of compacted trash.  At night, he wiles away the hours watching an old videotape of ""Hello Dolly"" and pining away for a female companion who will alleviate his loneliness and bring some meaning to his life.  Then, one fine day, his dream becomes a reality when a sleek, sexy little number named Eve - actually an environmental robot sent from the way station to see if any signs of life have returned to the planet - shows up unexpectedly in Wall-E's neighborhood.The early section of the movie, in which Wall-E wordlessly goes about his business against a haunting backdrop of a decaying infrastructure and heaps of garbage, has much of the delicate beauty and sense of wonder we find in the opening moments of ""E.T."" (whose main character obviously served as the model for Wall-E).  Written and directed by Andrew Stanton and brought to life by an army of miracle-working animators too numerous to mention, ""Wall-E"" is one of those rare films that, through sheer visual design alone, is able to magically transport us to the unique little world it's created.  The burgeoning romance between the two mechanical creatures is handled with a great deal of tenderness and wit, and the film is sprinkled with subtle little homages to ""West Side Story"" (in the aerial views of the city), ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Titanic"" for the more cinematically astute among us to revel and delight in.  In the second half of the movie, ""Wall-E"" travels to the spaceship housing the colony of ex-patriot earthlings, where he encounters problems with a sophisticated computer who wants to control the humans and prevent them from returning to a planet that just may be becoming inhabitable once again.This is a sweet and wistful fable about not only how each individual must find his own special place in the universe but how we as a species must cherish and preserve this one special place we all call home.  Yet, for all its rare and wonderful qualities, I wish I could say that I loved this movie more than I do.  For like some of Pixar's other products, ""Wall-E"" is more impressive in its visuals than in its storytelling.  Too often in ""Wall-E"" we feel as if the narrative is lagging a few paces behind all the technical ingenuity.  Indescribably beautiful as it is to look at, the movie doesn't generate sufficient conflict and drama to pull us all the way into the story.  And for that reason, ""Wall-E,"" while a true cornucopia of visual delights and easily one of the most spectacular-LOOKING films ever made, still falls just a hairsbreadth short of greatness when all is said and done."	4.0	visually astonishing but somwhat lacking in drama	2008-07-10	6	5	1

(I was checking my watching every ten minutes to see when it would be over.)  These are the reasons I did not like it: 1) It took too long for the story to get going--or for Wall-e to board the spaceship; 2) the characters lacked development--especially Wall-e who is the main character (I didn't feel anything for these characters: Wall-e, the Captain, etc.); and 3) this movie was filled with cliches, such as the Captain is going to rebel against the Higher Authority, insignificant Wall-e is going to save the day, we reap what we sow (or in this case the garbage that we made is the garbage that our planet turned into), etc.  I would have to say Wall-e is the first movie that I thought could NOT be enjoyed by both kids and adults.

Adults who love animation will have fun watching this movie but it won't knock your socks off like Finding Nemo, Toy Story or Cars.Little ones from say 5 to 10 years old will love this light hearted soft toned movie more then older kids and that is what I believe it is soft toned.Some will find it boring and lacks depth in the characters. Frankly as good as this movie is they could have had more fun making Wall-E a little more interesting in his personalty he reminded me of Charlie Brown sorta bland but hey how much personality can you give a robot, lol.And as for the complaint about the way to many fat people on the ship doing nothing not seeing the world around them, maybe it hit way to close to home for some, lol. Nothing wrong with reality story line in animation take a look around, that future for humans is closer then you think, lol.All in all a good movie I would give 4 stars for animation but only 3 stars cause the plot dragged to much in the first quarter of the movie and I can't give it even close to 5 stars like I said in the first part it's a cute movie not a absolute must see movie.	3.0	Nice Movie but not Pixars best.	2008-12-16	7	1	6

This is a movie with a great experience behind it.In this case I bought the Three disc set because it seemed like a very cool collection, and the Digital copy would go well on my Ipod. Well, I definitely got great Value.WALL-E as a story travels over time, through space, across the stars, and right into your heart.Apart from the Marvelous story that I am sure you must know the gist of by reading the summaries here, the Disc one Features has the fun of Burn-E. The Laughter of Presto. The Fabulous deleted scenes that are so fun you ask why they were deleted but never mind, its on the DVDs. Wall-Es tour of the Universe is a definite ride and a half. The Sound scape secrets are more than you could imagine. And to top it all off, there is a Commentary , wow, so much.But Wait, Says Billy, theres More:Disc 2 has so much that its hard to fit it into one day. The Documentary about Pixar that shows the heart and soul behind WALL-E and surprise, at least for me, there is Steve  Jobs. Wall-Es Treasures and trinkets is possibly the best selection of bits edited together since a Monty Python Sletch. The Collection of the Bots, kind of a compendium of who is who on the ship is just hilarious. And the Making of Featurettes just go on and on.Disc 3 has the Digital copy and its great.So much fun for such a Great price. This is a gem, and I have hardly scratched the surface of the DVD set.( So to speak ).ENJOY !!	5.0	A Whole Lotta Love	2009-02-09	0	0	0

He was Mr. Peepers and guest-starred in many other shows. He also was on Hollywood Squares. Unfortunately, he died quite young, so I'm guessing that readers born after 1965ish will definately not remember him.

"Director Andrew Stanton (Cars, etc.) does it again!Cars (Widescreen Edition)What a great film and a great DVD that's been put out by Disney-Pixar.Yes, of course there are messages about the environment, but critics to the contrary (the one star wonders) this is a message that needed to be said.  And said in a very entertaining way.It's a love story -- the little trash compactor Wall-E who is the last of his kind, achieved sentience and collects all kinds of stuff.  Talks to my inner pack rat.  And EVE, the female robot with the electronic giggle who shoots straighter than Annie Oakley and though at first run by her ""directive"" can bypass her programming and make things happen.  Gee, I might be set up in my ""programming"" too -- Internet, TV, commercials, etc., etc.It's a sci fi nostalgia:  Otto the Wheel auto pilot of course is an echo of HAL in the great film 2001: A Space Odyssey -- they even play the theme from it!2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)It's a film of discovery:  I don't just want to survive, I want to live.It's a wake-up call that there's more to life than shopping malls and insincere mega-corporations (B&L;)....  And are we blocking out so much human contact through the internet and sucked so into our iPods we forget there are people out there to meet and greet.It's a seamless animation piece.  The sound effects, live action and animation are so seamless, so perfect -- Pixar has really raised the standard.The DVD:  Interesting box, funny reticular cover.  Little cardboard holder for the DVD itself with a list of scene selections.  Burn-E, another little robot droid who gets sucked into the adventure of Wall-E and EVE.  Presto, a fun animation that harkens back to the good old cartoon days of Hanna Barbera and Chuck Jones films of the fifties and sixties.Deleted scenes add a bit more to the story but nothing spectacular.  Wall-E's tour of the universe takes us out there, gives a bit more animation.The legends of Disney sound effects and animation go into fascinating detail.  If you're a history buff of Disneyania, then this is for you.Sneak Peeks gives us the low-down on the newest DVDs coming out: Prince Caspian, the 70th anniversary of Pinocchio and more.  Actual NASA space shots in a lot of sequences.And of course the advertising and the yada yada we're Disney blah blah.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	"I keep waiting for Pixar to crank out a dud.  Sooner or later these guys have to mail one in, don't they?  But as I see trailers for seemingly dubious films - a rat who wants to be a chef?  an old man tying balloons to his house?  a sequel starring Tim Allen? - I find myself being sucked in by the sheer brilliance of the storytelling and the enchanting visual sights of the studio's animation.And so it came as little surprise that I found myself tearing up during the tale of a lovable little garbage processor named Wall-E.In many ways, ""Wall-E"" is the studio's most ambitious effort to date.  In our star-obsessed movie culture, here is a major motion picture without a recognizable star.  Our movies are increasingly action-and-info-packed, with quick one-liners hyper-edited into fantastic action scenes spliced together of moments that take less than a second, and yet ""Wall-E"" opens with a languid 25-minute stretch with little action and no dialogue.  And for an industry that is designed to cater to its audience, here is a movie that not-too-subtly insults the audience as it sits passively, swilling gallons of soda and inhaling millions of calories worth of popcorn and candy.And yet it works - this is one of the most original and delightful movies of the last five years.  Wall-E, who is seemingly a combination of ET and R2D2, is a hero for our age - the definitive little guy who goes after a girl completely out of his league and who gets a chance to save civilization in the process.Look elsewhere for a regurgitation of the plot or key points - this is a movie to be experienced and savored.

The DVDs simply slide into the cardboard slots and they are not secure, so they slide around enough that they get a little scratched in shipping. The thickness of the DVDs warps the shape of the cardboard case because the case was not made big enough for them. I'd expect this kind of packaging for a free AOL disk, not three DVDs.  One of the copies was missing the code insert for the digital copy.None of them worked correctly in any of my DVD players, my family's DVD players, or my PS2.  They all skipped at the same spots.  I'm sure this is a copy protection ""feature"" meant to make it difficult to copy.  The problem here being that I bought three copies, so I'm not a pirate.  Why do I have to be subjected to this punishment?So I tried the DRM-encrusted digital copy.  Playing the digital copy requires you to register it online.  I tried the two codes that came with the three copies and for both, iTunes said that the code was invalid.Do not buy this disk set unless you plan on buying a new DVD player along with it.

It also shows how much our society depends on technology and how it can become a detriment to the evolution of our species.

The the deserted city, the lonely tone highlighted by the old VHS movie, the stuff that Wall-E kept (""He"" threw away the diamond ring and kept the box), the orbit full of deserted satelites and simply all the nitty-gritties point to just one thing: The whole crew is so devoted to make it perfect. IMHO, they did it. However, the drastic change in style and mood afterwards is just too odd. Many people like the romance in space. I dont. The shift of focus from Wall-E to Eve, Auto and the Captain had made the movie much less interesting. The weak fight againt Auto for a return to Earth is far from thrilling. No matter what, a great try of Pixar to create something out of its box. Definitely Wall-E will be a classic character.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A28NK2ADL4YOZ0	"Silalus ""Weaver of Worlds"""	"WALLE stands alone atop the twin peaks of both animation as a medium and science fiction as a genre. As a fusion of art and technology it is an achievement that is almost impossible to overstate. And even forgetting that context and watching it simply as a film, WALLE may be one of the finest movies you will ever see.During my lifetime animation has come into its own as an unparalleled medium of expression. From ""Beauty and the Beast"" to ""Shrek"", ""Lilo and Stitch"" to ""Happy Feet"", and countless others less well known, animated movies have taken us to worlds that conventional films could never touch while exploring love and life with a purity that traditional characters could never match. So, with that in mind, it would be unfair to say that WALLE puts every other animated movie that you have ever seen to shame...So instead I will say this: it fulfills their promise.So too during my lifetime has popular science fiction come into its own. Movies like ""Star Wars"", ""Silent Running"", ""The Matrix"", and ""Blade Runner"" have immersed us all in strange, extraordinary new worlds while teaching us about our own. They've offered us warnings and wisdom that stories too deeply grounded in the ""real world"", in the here and now, can't match.And WALLE fulfills the promise of sci-fi too, just as it does animation. It is almost as meaningful as it is beautiful.When you watch WALLE you will find yourself immersed in a story of loneliness and of perseverance. You will see, perhaps for the first time, pure childlike wonder and almost angelic, unconditional love. You'll receive a stark warning about our possible future as a species, but above all else you'll accept a deeply gratifying testimony about what it means to be human.You'll experience the story through an indescribable variety of endearing robot characters- each one totally unique and perfectly sculpted by Pixar in the sweet spot just this side of the ""uncanny valley"". They are inhuman enough to do the most hilarious, wonderful, bizarre things without us questioning them, and yet human enough that you will love them all. And leading the pack, the title character himself is possibly the most sympathetic protagonist that any movie has ever presented.WALLE the character seems to display every quality that can melt our human hearts: curiosity, cleverness, selflessness, innocence, humor, loyalty, and love. And he has all those qualities bound together in an adorable physical form that is simply perfect. You will fall in love with him.And that, in the end, is the thing that really makes this movie something that begs to be experienced. The visuals are incredible, the humor is wonderful, the futurist wisdom is powerful, and the themes are moving. The artfulness and daring of long stretches with no dialogue at all is utterly amazing. But ultimately the best quality of this film is how we are made to fall in love with WALLE himself as we watch him live his life.I went to WALLE expecting to see more Pixar brilliance and a funny story about a clunky old PC falling in love with a Mac. I didn't go expecting to fall head-over-heels in love with a robot and a film that both have a soul.But I did. And so will you."	5.0	The pinnacle of both animation and science fiction... with a soul.	2008-07-14	15	12	3

Johnson ""Lerxst"""	"The reviewers who claim that Wall-e is some malicious form of clandestine liberal wacko propaganda that will warp the minds of impressionable children need to lighten up and smell the paranoia. In their worldview,  ""Drill, Baby, Drill!"" would be a much more inspiring premise for this film. Okay then, why not make remake the movie in your own vision, with Wall-e as a robotic uber-hero (like Ayn Rand's Howard Roark), who doesn't need anyone but himself and his intransigent force of will to help re-industrialize an economically depressed planet as he teams up with the Big and Large titans of industry, whose sweat and blood is the embodiment of the virtue of selfish egoism but also trickles down to the benefit all of mankind?Instead of trash everywhere, oil and gas derricks and nuclear cooling towers and the smokestacks of coal plants swamp the skyline as Wall-e works on the greatest and most objectively rational project of all: the world's largest SUV production plant.Meanwhile, after being voted off the planet, all the hippie liberals wander through space on the SS Noam Chomsky in a vessel made out of cannabis and piloted by a direct descendant of Keith Olbermann and Katrina vanden Heuvel. Seeking to return to Earth one day to force the enemies of liberalism into Marxist communes and Reeducation Camps, Eve arrives from the Chomsky, only to find instead a thriving industrious society that is so perfectly utopian that taxes and entitlements and homosexuals have all been abolished. In the closing shot, we see Wall-e as he rolls to the top of his nearly completed paragon of neoconservative values (and non-union to boot!) with Eve hovering at his side, in subjugated awe of Wall-e's infallible logic as he expounds in electronic beeps and chirps for 45 minutes, effectively deconstructing and disproving, once and for all, that vast liberal conspiracy known as global warming. And in a brief humorous parting shot of the Chomsky, the ineptitude and touchy-feely emotionalism of the left-wing wackos results in their destruction as the vessel, its inhabitants all out of marijuana and unable to grow anymore due to an ongoing labor strike, goes up in flames as Lieutenant Bill Maher IX attempts to light the ship and smoke it by driving it right into the sun. The End.On second thought, that's not so inspiring, is it? I'll stick with the version Pixar made -- a visually stunning masterpiece with a great anachronistic soundtrack and a thought-provoking plot for adults and a magical story of friendship that my children thoroughly love and enjoy..."	5.0	Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy abounds in Wall-e???	2008-12-26	1	1	0

Having a car to drive, constantly listening to my iPod, and Lord knows I would have serious heart faliure if my Wii or PS3 where broke. Have I became to reliant on technical luxaries? As much as I'd like to say no, the answer is yes. Has America? Yes. Does Pixar think so? Yes. Does Wall-E think so? Yes. Will it open some eyes to this concern? Hopefully.Pixar has been getting out of their old version of movies, you know, 'The Secret Life of Things We See Everyday' ( Bug's Life, Toy Story, even Ratatoullie) and moving on to more modern images, such as cars and robots. Keeping with this swing of modernization, we are presented with the summer block-buster, Wall-E.You can take Wall-E from face value and have a great time at the movies; a clumsy, bashful packaging droid wiith his life-scanning robot-lover relize Earth is life adoptable, and bring humans over to re-populate it. That's fine, no problems there. Pixar delights our eyes with the ever so fluid movements of humans and their robotic companiions, colored in with a surprisingly bland, but symboic, palate of whites, blacks, and oranges.Wall-E gives some deeper reason to it's rhyme than the easy to digest plot. The folks at Pixar are giving a clear 'tech is bad' vibe, especially to cell phones (wake up and smell the flowers, or should I say pool). And I'm sure Disney would love for us to go back in time to the ""Hello Dolly"" era, heck, we might find true love there.Wall-E can be lokked apon as a warm hearted family film, as all Pixar projects can be, or as a wake up slap on the face to our citizens. Either way, it will please all."	5.0	Symbolism in Space	2008-11-02	4	4	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3R8PXSFGY9MC2	Spider Monkey	`Wall-E' is a better than average film from the Pixar studios that brought us gems such as `Toy Story' and `Monsters Inc'. After the studio's recent lack lustre outings `Wall-E' is a return to form, with the usual slick and polished animation but with a good story this time, it manages to captivate and charm you most of the way through. Following a clean-up robot (Wall-E) on earth and the romance that develops with a probe robot (EVE) sent to find life, this story manages to be endearing without the usual saccharine sweetness American films love so much. Ok, you get cute characters and the flowing music, but they don't seem out of place and sit very well with the overall storyline. Wall-E then follows EVE back to her mother ship, the Axiom, where humankind has been living after polluting earth to such a degree they had to leave. The plot then follows their romance and what happens when the captain of the ship finds a plant inside EVE and what it may mean for his passengers. As you may expect there is a happy ending and the various funny touches Pixar is renowned for and underlying this is a moral message about polluting earth and our unsustainable way of life, that thankfully isn't rammed down your throat. Overall this is a beautifully animated film, with a great main character and a story to keep you hooked for the 90 minutes duration. Worth checking out if you're a fan of Pixar films and animation in general.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.	4.0	Wall-E	2011-01-30	0	0	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3FEQXNCFC68KC	"SRFireside ""ZOOM!"""	We all know Pixar makes great computer animated movies that the whole family enjoys. We know that Pixar has yet to make a bad movie in regards to box office draw and critical acclaim. There is no question that if the movie is from Pixar it will be good. So I'm going to focus this review on where it falls in the particular genre it was made in: Science Fiction. Wall-E is not only a good family computer cartoon. It's good sci-fi.This movie delves into concepts and technologies in a mature way for a family movie. The first and for many the most glaring example is the commentary on the dark side of consumerism. Wall-E tackles it without being too preachy and better yet in an entertaining way. The concept of the Earth being evacuated because there is too much garbage is kind of silly, and the movie runs with that with tongue firmly in cheek. The concept of Earth's remaining civilization lounging around in cruise ships in space takes it even further into entertaining absurdity. A lesser movie would make all this snarky, but Wall-E doesn't fixate on these concepts and instead just uses it as a setting for the real story.The real story is Wall-E and how his purity and fascination with the world around him changed everybody around him. On one hand he is worker drone doing the same job cleaning garbage daily apparently for centuries. On the other hand he shows real appreciation for the simple things that we humans sometimes take for granted. This love of life is what Wall-E spreads like a virus to everybody he interacts with, both humans and robots. This turns the story into a very endearing testament to how a single good heart (machine or otherwise) can make a difference.I might be making this sound like a sugary sweet drama, and that is far from the truth. All this endearing stuff is presented with the signature comedic timing that Pixar is known for. In a word the script is smart. It balances the more serious and sappy elements with equally fun moments. Another cool thing about the movie is the entire first act is almost completely devoid of dialog. It's a great example of what can be done using techniques that were executed during the silent film era and how they still apply today.I have always said if you are going to make an animated film where an actor is not fully utilized on the screen you better have good voice acting. Again this is an aspect that Pixar has always excelled in. Only this time voices both synthetic and synthetically manipulated adds a new level of excellence. Ben Burt does the voice of Wall-E as well as the sound design that makes his voice both robotic and emotive. He also makes EVE sound so good too. They also use actual voice synthesis programs, which adds to the whole robot vibe.I'm a big sci-fi tech buff and the design of the ships, robots and other technologies is pretty smart. Lots of functionality can be seen as well as details that bely some serious thinking behind the technology. This is something you don't expect from a movie geared toward a very broad audience. Especially when all these details are very understated, just as they should be. If you are a tech-head like me Wall-E will satisfy.This Blu-Ray release is essentially identical to the previous two disk Blu-Ray release with the addition of a DVD version of the movie on the third disk. Lots of extras are in both Blu-Rays. The movie disk has essentially the feature and the Pixar shorts. The second disk has an interesting menu selection that delves into the background and making of stuff. Here's the breakdown:Pixar Shorts:Presto - A hilarious cartoon about a magician's magic hat(s) and a hungry rabbit. This short is full of good ole' physical comedy and has probably brought more tear inducing laughs from the people I shown it to than any other short.Burn-E - There is a little joke in the movie where EVE and Wall-E return to the ship after flying around in space and end up locking out a welding robot. Well this short chronicles his adventures. It's a really fun short, but being the stickler for continuity that I am I have to say it's inconsistent with ship locations on the movie, thus not canon. Still that's no reason to not see it. It's a really good short. You also get an option to do a picture-in-picture (PIP) with storyboards of the short.Behind the Scenes Featurettes:The Imperfect Lens: Creating the Look of Wall*E - Documentary on visual design. (approx 15 minutes)Animation Sound Design: Building Worlds from the Sound Up - Extensive documentary on... you guessed it... audio design. (approx 20 minutes)Captain's Log: The Evolution of Humans - Did you know the original idea for the humans on this movie is that we evolved into lazy lumpy blobs? An interesting documentary on that and why they went the direction they did. (approx 10 minutes)Commentary with Directory Andrew Stanton. - I haven't heard it yet, but I'm told it's required listening for fans of the movie. It also has a Cine-Explore option where you also get PIP images of storyboards, production stills and so on.Geek Talk, Trash Talk & Trivia - It's a sort of visual commentary done like Mystery Science Theater 3000. Four members of the production staff are sitting in theater seats (in dark silhouette like they are sitting in the front row) and making comments about the film. Some are informative trivia, but it's mostly a gag track.The Pixar Story - It's not really anything to do with Wall-E, but it's an amazing and extensive look at Pixar itself. From the birth of the company (and before) up to its current pinnacle in the movie industry. Tons of interviews, early clips, you name it. This is THE documentary on the history of the company (approx 1 1/2 hours).Deleted Scenes - There are four deleted and alternate scenes. Unlike lots of Pixar deleted scenes where you just get storyboards here you actually get almost finished animation. Just a couple of them are rendered, but it's sure nice to see them.BnL Shorts - Three shorts done in a Buy-N-Large promotional campaign for the Axiom, Operation Cleanup and the Robots. They are actually really informative for what amounts to commercials on the designs and world of Wall-E. Not as well produced as the traditional Pixar Shorts, it is still a very well made setup and worth checking out.Bot Files - This is a breakdown of the various robots in the movie. Clock on a robot and you get a quick profile as well as a quick advertising blurb on its capabilities. Kind of lean on the information, but still enjoyable nevertheless.3-D Set Fly-Throughs - Short but pretty sweet set of location fly throughs. Click on a part of the Axiom and you get to hover over the entire area and see the computer rendered backdrop. There are also flybys of Wall-E's home and the city. It's more of an atmospheric enjoyment thing than anything else, but it's nice.Wall-E's Treasures & Trinkets - Another short that collects a bunch of tiny vignettes with Wall-E interacting with one item or another. These were shown in between shows on the Disney Channel for a while. My son loves watching them and I'm glad they have them collected here in one spot.Bot Storybook - It's essentially a visual book done in the same literary class as Dr. Seuss. It's narrated by Kathy Najimy and has enough moving animation to keep the toddlers interested in watching. There is also a play along mode where you can mess with it somehow.Interactive Games - This isn't some weird DVD/BD game. There are arcade games. The same as those back in the 80's. If you have seen the end credits of Wall-E and remember the parts with the low bit computer images of Wall-E and gang imagine that put to video games. Now keep in mind these are very simple games. Even simpler than some Atari 2600 games (even if the graphics are better), but they are a fun distraction now and then.There is also a couple easter eggs i believe on the first one. Move up from Play Movie until the E in Wall-E goes from red to blue then enter. You get a quickie Geek-O-Rama featurette. Go left from the Set Up on the main menu until a dot appears on Sneak Peaks, then enter. That gives you a little animation test.Gallaries, trailers and whatnot.Wall-E is probably the best family science fiction film there is. It has plenty of elements to entertain the sci-fi fan and plenty more for the rest. If you are in one of those households that has Blu-Ray players and DVD players this is the release to get. If you only have one then you may want to do some price comparisons between this version and the previous releases. Either way Wall-E is wonderful.	5.0	One of Pixar's Best	2011-05-26	13	10	3

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2PRASPRTXU6EV	S. Stutzman	Let's be upfront and frank. You will not be disappointed in watching this film. It's one of the best animated movies in years. The graphical design and animation are superb. That is one of the great benefits of animated movies over any other genre of movies: great story lines, cinematography, rich full colors and textures, etc can all be adjusted exactly how the animators desire. Nothing is really impossible for animation films(except limited to budgets) and this film in many ways is brilliant.However the movie, while surpassing most recent animated movies in brilliance except Kung Fu Panda, is somewhat forgettable. The storyline is a bit flat and character development of the main characters of Wall-E and Eve were disappointing. That really is/is not the fault of the Pixar since the characters are rather mute during the film. Despite great non-verbal communication, I found it difficult to attach myself to the characters. After getting through about half the movie, Wall-E got to be rather predictable although still enjoyable. I do believe 20 minutes of the movie could have been cut out as the movie began to drag a bit by the end.The final question I always ask myself in assessing a movie is whether it has high re-watch value. This had the overall impression of med-low re-watch value yet I would rate the film overall at A-(Also, don't forget to check out Burn-E in the extras AFTER watching the film. Perhaps my favorite part of the film and hands down the best thing I've seen in the past 5 - 10 years. Extremely creative.)	4.0	Great but not quite classic	2009-02-26	4	2	2

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3I69IXPTDVKQF	Stephen B. O'Blenis	Probably the best non-Japanese animated movie in several years, Wall-E delivers on so many levels.  I actually had high hopes for this one, expecting it to be cute and funny, and those hopes were not only met but surpassed.  The surprise though was how great it was in other areas at the same time - a touching love story, an epic futuristic odyssey/adventure, and - despite the wonderfully cute, whimsical nature of its animation style - a surprisingly unsettling and plausible-feeling look at the future of the world and all that once lived on it.It's centuries after a total envirornmental breakdown has left the Earth uninhabitable amd humanity retreated to deep space, leaving behind legions of clean-up robots to try and repair the damage and eventually pave the way for humans to come back to a reinvigorated planet.  Wall-E is apparantly the only such robot left functioning - we see rusted derelicts of similar robots that presumably broke down ages ago - and his only companion is a small cricket he's found and keeps as a pet.  During the day Wall-E continues going on about his assigned chores, pausing to collect trinkets and gadgets that amuse him from the ruins, and at night he retreats to the home he's made himself inside an old metal bunker, where he carefully stores his collections and even watches old human movies he's managed to scavenge. This has been the lovable little robot's life for a llong time, when two new events change the balance of things.  The first is Wall-E's discovery of an actual live, growing plant amidst the ruins of mankind's old cities - evidently the first plant found in a long time; the second is the arrival of one of the robot-manned probes the human race set up to return to Earth periodically and assess its currently livability.The machine that emerges from this ship is a female robot named EVE (like WALL-E, an acronym, but we'll call her Eve for short), the first new robot friend Wall-E's had a chance to make in eons.  Although the pair gets off to a rocky start (Eve's line of robots comes armed, and Eve herself is rather trigger-happy), a beautiful little relationship begins to form as Eve goes about her assesment and Wall-E shows her around and shelters her in his little bunker.  The robots talk in this movie, but its mostly in strange little noises and sound effects, and only occasionally can we make out a word.  Oddly though there's no difficulty at all in understanding them, even during scenes where a single robot is alone for long periods of time.  And despite the fact that they're metal robots, the body language and yes, even facial expressions (often on robots who don't at first glance appear to really Have faces, per se) conveys tonnes of feeling - not in an exxagerated, bug-out way, but in subtle and very affecting ways.  Heck, even the cricket conveys a lot through body language.When Eve's probe returns for her and the plant is discovered, a series of pre-programmed protocols spring into effect, as the vessel takes the plant as evidence and rockets off toward man's new home way out deep in the solar system, around Saturn.  Wall-E and Eve are along for the ride, and Wall-E encounters what's become of human civilization as it floats out in space waiting for a return home that was supposed to have come centuries earlier.This is when the movie starts twisting in some unexpected directions, and since we're already at around the half-way point, I won't say too much more specific.  It never falters for one moment though.  Full to brimming with adventure, awesome animated visuals, humor, romance, and a surprisingly deep exploration of a possible future, the movie is an unmitigated success on many levels and definately one of 2008's best.  Incredible ending, by the way.A couple of animated shorts come included with the movie.  'BURN-E' takes a robot who was seen very briefly in the movie (one of the robots on the automated human ship out by Saturn) and gives him a starring role in his own short feature, seamlessly combining brief scenes from the movie with new footage to tell a tale of the little maintenance robot.  It's a great little work in its own right and also serves to fill out the larger story even more.  The other, 'Presto', is about a stage magician and his rabbit.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with the Wall-E story but is definately worth including - it's hilarious.  You know, if you take the top two dozen (in North American box office terms) comedy movies of any given recent year, then take out the four or five Best, all the remaining twenty or so may well not have as much laughs as that one little (maybe seven minutes?) short, Presto.  It's pure comedic magic.  And both these shorts make the Wall-E movie even more indispensible.	5.0	Outstanding On So Many Levels	2009-05-01	2	1	1
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A25IR5TA337JSO	Stephen	Some will scoff, but 50 years from now critics and fans will consider this one of the greatest movies of its age. It is a parable every bit as frightening as the myriad of dystopia movies that warn our generation that its course cannot end well. Yet it is full of hope, not because a superhero sets things right in a day, but because ordinary people finally learn (from their machines, of all things) that there is more to life than consumption.	5.0	Pixar's Masterpiece	2014-02-24	1	1	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	ARIDN94LOCQFD	Steve Taylor	"Pros: The animation is outstanding even by Pixar standards. The love story between the two main characters is cute and even though they are robots you end up almost believing it could happen. The secondary characters are shallow but add good comedy relief. Wall-E is an extremely lovable character which was pulled off very well especially considering Pixar gave him nothing to say but his own name.Cons: One of my concerns of having Disney own Pixar is that Disney will end up ruining them. And it looks like Disney's agenda has crossed the line, that's why this gets 3 stars. The movie is one long sermon on man destroying this planet. If you adhere to Al Gores ""An Inconvenient Truth"" you'll probably love this movie but if you don't the preaching may get a bit old. While in the end there is hope (man made) it's not enough to pull this movie from the left wing propaganda.Pixar needs to return to a good storyline that's entertaining, without the social commentary.  Don't we get enough of that already? Let children be children and stop feeding them lies to scare them into submission. Even the obvious effects of obesity and lethargy, although true in many cases, doesn't have to be touted in a family picture.The Pixar Short ""Presto"" which was shown before the feature gets 5 big stars.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2KVUYPLEW4LXT	"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time"""	"The Day the Earth Stood StillFrom a view of deep space, a familiar voice starts to sing a familiar old song from a familiar old musical, as the song builds, the camera zooms in on the Earth, then fades out till you see that it's coming from a tiny little robot all olone on a wasteland Earth of the future. Thus, in the first moments of the new animated film from Pixar, you get an immediate feeling of...awkward weirdness. This move is not what you would expect. Sure, there's fantastic animation from the server farms at Pixar, cuteness galore, and a family-friendly, feel-good story to be found. However...For the first half-hour or so there is only one character to be found, the namesake of the film, a cute little robot who goes about his day compacting trash, and stacking it into SKYSCRAPERS of crushed garbage, all the time collecting knick-knacks and entertaining himself listening to his music from his favorite musical, which he watches in a little robot home he has fashioned. Really, all this is just to give us a very strong picture of what the world has become and what the personality of our pint-sized hero is. His treads roll through the abandoned metropolis where giant stores and billboards advertise for a super-corporation nation's products, slowly cluing the unaware in to the fact that humans consumed everything on the planet, produced garbage until they were buried in their own waste, and when the Earth was reduced to a lifeless junkyard where no planets can survive and acid rains from the sky and dust storms destroy everything in their wake, they left. Even worse, we can the remains of others of our protagonist's kind along the way, reduced to scrap. This could be REALLY disturbing, especially for a children's film. Somehow though, that bullet is dodged by the little fellow who only speaks in what my father calls ""robot baby speak"". He is incredibly entertaining to watch, and incredibly cute. Even if you can't tell exactly what he is doing or saying, you like him immediately and watch everything he does. You are never bored of his one-robot antics as he compacts, collects, and then comes home to watch his movie and long for a companion of his own. And a companion he does find!The Singing Dancing RobotLittle WALL*E finds himself suddenly no longer alone when a spaceship lands and drops off a probe robot to search for life on the desolate planet. At once terrified, curious, and enamored with the first FEMALE robot he has ever seen, cute little WALL*E jumps through many hoops to get EVE's attention (without being blasted by her excessively itchy blaster arm), and woo her with his accomplishments (I loved when she asked him what his directive was he compacted some trash and said ""Taadaa!"", as well as when he showed her his favorite movie and did a little song and dance). EVE is largely unimpressed with WALL*E himself (come on, he's ANCIENT compared to her), but indulges him, until her shows her his greatest treasure (the plant she has been looking for). After detecting the planet EVE completely shuts down, and WALL*E spends all his time trying to protect her, then follow her after she is picked up by the spaceship and taken back to the mothership. Naturally WALL*E is in store for a major shock as he enters the glistening giant starship, and quickly finds himself bumping into various robots and human inhabitants (who have been raised on a diet of heavy convenience and low interaction to the point of turning themselves into little more than blob people in a permanent state of recline). Everywhere WALL*E goes however, he makes a strong impression with his cute personality, and his built-in recorder which keeps playing at awkward moments with snipets of his favorite song (which comes to be the way that robots and humans identify him).""G-I-V-E  M-E  T-H-E  P-L-A-N-T""From there things go into the standard ""heroes on the run while stopping-the-evil-plot"" ploy, wherein the plant is almost destroyed, and then continually chased by a HAL-like autopilot robot determined that the ship must never return to Earth (which it will automatically do when the ship confirms that Earth-life exists). The discovery of this plot (and the recording of everything that WALL*E did for EVE while she was asleep) results in EVE's change of feeling toward the little guy, who had gotten both of them in deep trouble by making the security droids think they are going rogue (and it didn't help that WALL*E accidentally let all the nutty robots out of the robot psyche ward). Naturally the hero triumphs in the end and a happy ending awaits all with a feel-good message about saving the Earth and starting over again with a little love and willingness to work to improve things.""Define dancing.""What makes this more than just an interesting movie (and takes it to the realm of a good film, possibly a classic) is the way that everyone and everything in the movie, except for the spokesman of that evil BnL corp (who keeps appearing in live-action video excerpts), and the evil red-eyed autopilot and it's minions, is basically kind and friendly and good-hearted. WALL*E accidently runs over his cockroad friend, and shrieks, but the cockroach is unharmed. When WALL*E bumps into some people and tears off their displays and headphones, they are more curious and surprised than annoyed. Little robots going about their jobs get irritated by WALL*E's dirt and antics, but grow to love him, just as EVE does when she sees what a kind soul he is. But what really nailed it for me was the attitude of the captain of the ship.""All you needed was some to take care of you.""When you see that he can't ever sit up without a motorized seat-back and a cup of coffee (after sleeping in till 12:30!), you might at first think he would be irked  by the hassle of the prospect of returning to Earth (heck, he can't even read the return manual!). But no, this guy is so used to only have one job to do in a day (tell everyone what time it is and what the weather is like) that he's really excited at the prospect of something happening. And as he slowly comes to realize that the world long ago was reduced to a wasteland because his ancestors sat back and did NOTHING as the world was destroyed, he galvanized to action and works with WALL*E and EVE to get the planet recognized and the ship returning to Earth. I love the scene where the captain examines the plant and slowly realizes world could have been saved long long ago if people had only tried to do something to help the world instead of destroying it in their greed.""WAL*E!!!!!""There is a jarring transition when WALL*E goes into space. From that point onward, the movie feels far less like watching an actual robot moving through a desolate planet, and much more like watching a cartoon movie. The downside is that while the title character continues  to be followed throughout the rest of the movie, he doesn't seem to be the focus anymore. A fish out of water with a somewhat low IQ, poor little WALL*E spends the rest of the movie largely running and hiding from trouble, or chasing after EVE, all the while seemingly blissfully unaware of how bad the situation is getting. To its credit the movie keeps its momentum by being constantly entertaining and almost always humorous despite the shift in focus.""EVA?""From another point of view, you could find the second half of the movie to have an almost Forest Gump type of feel, as the title character is swept up in huge issues way beyond his understanding, but keeps trying to win the perhaps overly-sophisticated female by sheer persistence and good intentions. Poor WALL*E, even in a crisis, can only think about how much he wants to hold EVE's hand.""You're all gonna become farmers!""The best advice I can give you for watching this film is to keep an open mind as I did, and not carry any expectations. Yeah, this movie may seem heavy-handed and soap-box-preachy in its environmentalism (and seriously anti-corporation to the point of almost anti-American to boot), and at times downright distrubing at times to litle kids (the autopilot electrocutes WALL*E nearly to death and he is nearly crushed to pieces trying to hold up the platform for the plant so the ship will return to Earth). But in the end the peril and sadness lead to a happy ending, and if you can swallow people living their entire lives in space returning to Earth (in reality their bones would  be crushed like egg shells), then this is one ultimately satisfying sci-fi trip.This is a brave new direction for Pixar and Disney, moving yet closer to PG rated animated films, or at the very least films with intelligence and depth for adults rather than pure kiddie glee-fests. The anmation is fantastic, especially in the beginning, the sound work is amazing, if hard to follow at times as the robots speak in robot-baby-speak, and the music, pacing, plot, and flow are quite excellent. The only truly GLARING flaw in the film to me is that the song WALL*E loves is overused WAY too much, and I would have liked it if there had been a lot more variety in the songs instead of the same one over and over and over and...yeah. That and the way that so much of the music seemed to be completely LIFTED from Star Wars, 2001:A Space Oddessy, ect, (can't Pixar just have someone write some new music by now?). I do however, LOVE the start-up sound WALL*E makes when he recharges (I used to hear that start-up sound every morning myself and it brings back warm memories).So there you have it, a brave new world of animation, a seemingly kiddie film with very adult editing (long stretch of isolation at the beginning and almost no real ""talking"" the entire film, great comedy and fun to be had, and a feel-good story with an important environmental message. Looking back on it now, this film is probably a must-own sci-fi classic....unless you're one of those people who rolled their eyes and walked out of Silent Running..."	5.0	The Last Robot on Earth...

At a particular point in the movie and that too when Wall E manages to get into the spaceship you wonder if the movie is still going to be all plastic and metal with only robots but the movie has surprises in store. The only other fault with the movie is accepting the fact that robots can feel love inspite of the development of artificial intelligence and robotics for the time period of the movie.Color, screenplay, design of the various environments, animation and story all get full marks. Eve was a gem of a creation. The music played in the background in one of the best scenes of the film, Eve's and Wall E's dance in space was beautiful.After The Incredibles, Wall E is the best to come from Pixar.

Not only the looks (which were by far the best Pixar has dished out) but also emotionally. I'll start with the star: WALL*E. He was THE most adorable thing I have seen. From the way he moved to the way he ""talked"". He oozed cuteness. WAAAALLEE! And then there was the relationship between WALL*E and EVE. I have seldom seen a more true relationship, even in humans. I think I speak for most when I say that I was a little teary at some parts, whether it be story related or from it's visual beauty. However, the movie is not just sun shine and rainbows. It has a very strong message, present throughout most of the movie that really unnerved me. This future is very possible. However, only Pixar could suceed in not turning it into the preachy film it so easily could have been. The perfect movie! Way to go Pixar! 10 out of 10"	5.0	A Classic!

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AVQ4CY0QZDVBR	TDM	This review is entirely from a perspective of a 26 year old that doesn't have kids but was curious because of the hype the movie created.  I am a big fan of Disney movies in general.  I think they are unique and provide some of the timeless classics that kids and adults watch and remember for years to come.Wall-E was once again an incredible motion picture created by the people at Pixar.  I constantly wonder how much more realistic an animated picture can get.  This film down to every detail was amazing.  I wish I had watched it on a Blue-ray disc.  At first the movie feels a bit like Cast Away, the Tom Hanks movie where there is hardly any bit of communication.  It was tough keeping my attention except for the incredibly detailed animation that was accompanying the film.As the movie went on the plot became more apparent and I started to enjoy the movie.  Don't worry there is talking eventually and you start to understand the communication as the movie roles on.  Was it the best movie Disney has created in a while?  I don't know, personally Ratatouille was more entertaining but Wall-E is really almost in a classification by itself.  I may have understood the point a little more if I had read reviews on it but overall it was another solid Disney movie.  I enjoyed it more after I watched it than while I was watching it if that makes sense.  4 & 1/2 stars would be my review but not five.  If you can watch it on the best TV you can and get it in Blu-Ray.  I think you will enjoy	4.0	An Adult with no Kids Review	2009-02-21	2	1	1

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2MYUI8IT6UBUU	"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com"""	Gorgeous visuals, perfected animation, and wondrously epic environments mask a relatively simple story of love, reminiscent of the best of Chaplin and Keaton. Little dialogue is necessary to convey this universal theme, and one of the most memorable characters to grace the screen in recent years comes to life in jaw-dropping realism - WALL-E.The last functioning trash-compacting robot on Earth, WALL-E (voiced by the inimitable Ben Burtt), leads a repetitive, solitary life in a world covered in massive amounts of garbage - the result of which forced mankind to leave its home planet several hundred years prior. WALL-E's lonely life drastically changes when technologically advanced scout droid EVE (Elissa Knight) lands on Earth to search for signs of life. When her objective is inadvertently achieved and she is taken back into space, WALL-E embarks on the adventure of a lifetime in an attempt to rescue the robot he has fallen in love with.With each film Pixar releases, the quality and realism of the animation appears to increase exponentially. Most notable here is the replacement of the animation staple of squash-and-stretch with genuine mechanical motions, and WALL-E's movements rival any found in the robotic effects of live-action blockbusters. It's a true testament to the power of animation when a heartwarming love story can be told without the use of standard dialogue or even a full set of facial features. Both WALL-E and EVE express love, fear, loneliness, surprise, anger, contempt, happiness, and a host of other emotions - and neither one has a mouth, nose, or eyebrows.The infinitely appealing character designs in Pixar's latest are easily the film's crowning achievement, and WALL-E himself is a marvel in both mechanics and innovative visuals. While the characters range from brilliant to truly inspired, the blend of realism with the fantastical produces an odd alternation in presentation. The intricate mechanical creations do provide a considerable contrast with the humans, but the engaging robots possess such a high level of realism that the blobby people don't seem fit to coexist. Add to this the actual scenes of human actors and it feels like three different worlds have collided in the future.With such monumental visuals and astounding animation in a superbly paced epic love story, it's easy to overlook the minor faults scattered throughout the film. The lack of an impressionable villain and memorable supporting characters might have hindered a lesser movie, but both WALL-E and EVE are so perfectly realized one won't likely notice the absence of other engaging creations. Pixar's track record has been virtually flawless since its first feature, and with their remarkable attention to detail and extreme focus on story, it's easy to see why. WALL-E succeeds in setting an even higher bar in animation and CG design and magnificently proves that it doesn't require copious amounts of dialogue to tell a great story.- The Massie Twins	4.0	WALL-E Movie Review by The Massie Twins	2008-06-26	6	4	2
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A26ZMEMGD5BCUQ	the Matt from Oz	Before I start, the low rating is for Amazon, not the film.  I LOVE THE FILM. I'm reviewing their bizarre mistake with the 2 blu-ray versions of this movie.I'm not a digital copy fan. I think it's the same excuse as HD-DVD's combo con to make a few (usually 5) extra bucks without giving the consumer a choice. Because there's no way on God's earth it costs them 5 bucks to produce it. HD fans WANT the highest quality, not neccesarily a lower-quality version of the SMAE thing in the SAME box (which is what you got in the past with no choice, and what you get if you but the 3-disc version of this movie. There is NO new/different content).So imagine my joy when I saw that there are 2 Blu-ray releases, one with, and one without the digital copy! Fantastic - now I can buy the one I want, which is this movie looking as good as it possibly can. If I'd wanted the convenience of portability, I'd probably just get the standard def dvd that I can play anywhere. Not both. So, fantastic. I don't have to pay a few bucks more for something I don't want!So what do Amazon do? Discount the non-digital-copy version LESS than the other, making them the SAME PRICE! How on earth does that tell Disney or anyone what we prefer as consumers?!So rather than get the 3-disc and have an extra bit of non-biodegradable landfill (do you see the irony there, Amazon.com?), I'll get the 2-disc version. But maybe now I won't get it from Amazon.FInally, what ever happened to Amazon's info on extra content? Is there even one Blu-ray page that has it? Because that would be really helpful in letting people know for example that the digital copy is just the first disc again, but in standard resolution...As for the film, four stars.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AEKVNXC6R8O9G	The philosopher	"WALL-E exemplifies how stale the genre of computer-animated movies has become.  The film is cloying and clich&eacute;d and looks like other Pixar motion pictures.  Wouldn't you think that by this point in time, Pixar could find a way to make people not appear to be inflatable sex dolls?  The movie is as lazy as the people who inhabit its dystopian future (of course, being a Disney movie, WALL-E has the obligatory uplifting, Disneyrific ending): It barely is long enough to be a feature film (hence the featurette ""Presto"" that precedes WALL-E, a short cartoon that is much more entertaining that the main feature), it uses a visually boring and ridiculously easy-to-animate probe (Eve) as one of its main characters, and its plot elements are so perfunctory that, for instance, when WALL-E appears to have ""amnesia,"" the scriptwriters don't bother to come up with a solution that would strain the characters or, for that matter, the scriptwriters--instead, after a few fretful minutes, WALL-E miraculously regains its memory, and all is again well in the world.The movie has a political message against consumer culture and against people who live only virtual lives, but, like everything else in the movie, the message is derivative: Idiocracy mined this thematic territory with better results a few years ago.  The musical and thematic allusions to 2001: A Space Odyssey only reinforce WALL-E's unoriginality.  But worst of all, the film's heart is as artificial and uninteresting as the robotic protagonists.  Could anyone really care or buy into the love story between these two cartoonish robots?  Perhaps children will find this film to be interesting (although the movie begins so slowly, I don't know that they still would be paying attention when the movie picks up steam later), but this movie has little to offer adults."	2.0	The FOLL-E of WALL-E [Theatrical release]	2008-07-13	66	10	56

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"When you have a track record like Pixar, each new film becomes compared to the best you have already done. If a new film doesn't attain these same levels, these same impossibly high levels, the same levels no one else can attain with such consistency, a film that would otherwise be good, is just OK. ""Wall-E"" is such a film. I didn't love ""Wall-E"", it doesn't achieve the greatness of ""Finding Nemo"", ""The Incredibles"" or ""Ratatouille"", but it is good. ""Cars"" good.In the future, the Buy N Large Corporation runs the Earth and it becomes so polluted they evacuate all humans, sending them to space on super deluxe spaceships, much like a cruise ship, for what they promise will be a five year trip. They are leaving behind a number of Wall-E robots, robots designed to collect and compact all of the trash humans have left behind, clearing the Earth of all garbage and allowing plant life to return. Seven hundred years later, there is one Wall-E left. He has developed a little routine and starts each morning listening to an old VHS tape of ""Hello Dolly!"" After rallying his pet cockroach, he heads out to work. If he needs a replacement part, he collects it from one of the many defunct Wall-E's and also collects a small ice cooler of odd objects that are of interest to him. One day, a spaceship touches down and releases a new modern probe called EVE. The shiny white robot begins to scour the area, looking for something. Wall-E watches from afar, entranced by the new robot. Suddenly, he understands what all of the singing and dancing in his favorite tape was about. Eventually, Wall-E and EVE meet and begin a relationship. But when EVE finds what she is looking for, Wall-E works desperately to follow her back to the mother ship and to keep their relationship going.Directed by Andrew Stanton, who directed ""Finding Nemo"" and worked on the ""Toy Story"" films and ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Wall-E"" is very similar in tone and feel to ""Finding Nemo"".The first half of the film sets up Wall-E's environment, showing us what his responsibilities are, what he does for fun, his friend (the cockroach) and his life. He enjoys watching an old VHS tape of ""Hello Dolly!"" because of the singing and dancing, but doesn't quite understand why he enjoys watching it. Every day, he sets out to work, taking his old ice cooler with him. When he finds a strange, or likable object, he throws it into the cooler and takes it back to his home, to store or use as decoration. As a robot, he happily goes about his daily routine, keeping an eye out for the frequent dust storms that seem to pop up and sweep across the landscape.As Wall-E sets out to do his work every morning, he passes the skyscrapers that are still standing, but very much vacant. As he collects the garbage and compacts it into little blocks, he builds his own skyscrapers, much like they must have built the pyramids.Then one day, he finds a strange object. A little plant, which he transplants to an old shoe. He takes it back to his living quarters.Then a spaceship shows up and EVE is left behind to scan the area. Initially, Wall-E watches her from afar because he is unsure of what or who she is. And it doesn't help that she has a mean laser gun, ready to fire at the slightest sound. So he follows her around, ducking behind garbage and other objects to watch her as she becomes more and more discouraged that she hasn't found what she is supposed to find.Eventually, they meet and Wall-E realizes why he has liked the singing and dancing in ""Hello Dolly!"" so much. He has fallen in love. And EVE is smitten too.This part of the film is almost completely without words, except for the occasional talking billboard or burst of music from the VHS tape, Wall-E and EVE are robots. They don't speak, but they do manage to make sounds that are like each other's names, communicating in this way. This, combined with the very different style of animation, may be a surprise to many. The children in the audience will probably universally accept it, but it isn't the same brightly colored animation we are used to. Many of the images are almost photorealistic, and everything has a hard edge, looks dusty (the Earth was abandoned due to pollution after all) and it looks a bit like an old spaghetti Western.But it is very sweet. Watching Wall-E go about his daily routine is akin to watching Chaplin or Keaton in one of their silent films. He has a definite routine, developed after so many years alone on the planet, that it is fun to discover what he does. We meet his pet cockroach. We see what he does for work. We see how he has adapted to the harsh living conditions. We even see where he lives. Then, when EVE enters the picture, his eyes get a little wide and we instantly understand. He is in love.As he follows EVE around, he watches what she is doing, scanning particular objects, looking for something. Initially, he stays hidden because he doesn't know how to react, but when they meet, their romance blooms.Then, when EVE finds a sample of what she is looking for, he body goes into autopilot and she summons the ship to return for her. Wall-E doesn't know what is going on, but when he sees the ship return, he knows he has to tag along or he might lose her forever.As Wall-E rides through outer space, it almost looks like the filmmakers took real footage of outer space and used this for their backgrounds. This sequence is truly beautiful and almost worth the price of admission alone.The ship returns to the mother ship and we meet the humans who escaped Earth over 700 hundred years ago. We see how they have adapted to life in outer space, how they have changed, and living with robots that cater to their every whim. They meet the Captain of the ship, who realizes what he has to do and this sets off a series of adventures between Wall-E, EVE, the humans and the other robots on board.The second half of the film is very different in tone and feel from the first half and it is a shift that almost derails the entire film. The filmmakers have been very inventive in creating this world, showing us how humans would evolve and adapt to a very lazy life on a cruise ship, their every whim provided for by highly automated robots. And they have created a whole series of robots, designed for every purpose.When the humans first appear, the animation shifts and we start to see more traditionally animated characters. They also are a little more amusing, maybe because they aren't that far removed from our current reality, and they speak. So there are a lot of very different things going on in this new part of the film.And Wall-E and EVE have to work to make things right, to finish EVE's mission. As they do this, they become closer and EVE realizes the true extent of Wall-E's feelings towards her.""Wall-E"" is a very good animated film, but it is only a good Pixar film. The two halves of the film work well, but because they are so different, they almost fail to come together and this requires the viewer to shift along with the tone and feel of the film. The first half, involving Wall-E and his courtship of EVE is almost a little magical and unlike anything we have ever seen in a film. The second half is busier, louder, more inventive and more action packed. It is interesting, but not nearly as magical and it is difficult to see the two halves as a whole. But because it is so well done, the two halves do fit together, just, and ""Wall-E"" is a very good film, enjoyable for the whole family."	4.0	"""Wall-E"" is a great animated effort, but only a good Pixar Animated Effort"	2008-07-07	7	4	3

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1ZAN7KBME97B3	Tiger100M	I know a lot of people consider this one of Pixar's greatest, but I find this one of Pixar's worst. I'm sorry, but when I saw this in the theater, it was boring, especially the first half. I almost fell asleep, just like with &#34; Happy Feet&#34;! Without the dialogue, I could not follow what was happening! The second half, ehhhhhhh, maybe there was some dialogue with the humans, but it still had little to no effort. That is really a shame because WALL-E was such a cute hero! His romance with EVE was cute, the villain was decent, the story had a good environmental message so many opportunities wasted because of a lack of dialogue! I admit I really liked the &#34; Presto&#34; short which was funny enough not to NEED dialogue. THIS feature film on the other hand is inexcusable! I remember I loved &#34; Kung Fu Panda&#34; WAY more than this in the summer of 2008. It's films like &#34; Kung Fu Panda&#34; that makes me think Dreamworks sometimes ( but not always) do better, and makes me doubt Pixar. I guess &#34;WALL-E&#34; is not that terrible, it just didn't do much for me. I am skipping thos one.	2.0	Puts Me To Sleep! &#128564;	2013-07-29	4	1	3

There are so many delightful moments in this film that intertwine into its brilliance that I never once thought ""eh, kid's movie moment."" The attention grabbing use of sound and visuals (the rocket lift-off was so flawless it felt like you were watching NASA stock footage) often make you forget you're viewing computer generated images, and the all-ages love story between two mis-matched characters is impossible to resist. (I kept thinking ofLady and the Trampas Wall-E trotted Eve through the rotted remains of the city to the sounds of show tunes.)Wall-E himself is a direct descendant of R2D2,E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrialand the one fromShort Circuit. He's a box of rust and bolts that you just want to squeeze and hug. He's all alone in a mess of someone else's making. Yet when the sleek and distinctly female Eve arrives, well, he is smitten and just wants to hold whatever passes for her hand. Except she is a probe, sent from the old colonists to see if the Wall-E's from centuries back have cleaned up enough to make the planet inhabitable.The messages are multi-layered throughout ""Wall-E."" The Planet needs to be taken care of. Some things are worth the wait. You don't always need to listen to the corporations. (Gee, funny how true that came to be 4 months after he movie came out.) You also need to take care of yourself and pay attention to the people around you. The fact that the simple little clean-up droid brought The Axiom's otherwise oblivious passengers together is an even greater message than the environmental one.There are - as with most Pixar films - a variety of nods to other films. You'll see tips of the cap to2001 - A Space Odyssey,Titanic, as well as self-references to Pixar'sToy StoryandRatatouille. Sigourney Weaver as the voice of the computer is a nice touch as well. The song from Peter Gabriel is one of the best he's done in years. There is so much imagination here and yet ""Wall-E"" never trips over its own cleverness. There's not much else to say other than this was one of the year's best movies. Pixar keeps making movies that raise the bar on brilliant. After all, who else has made a movie that makes cockroaches seem cute?"	5.0	The Universal Language	2008-12-13	1	1	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3GSWTW4PGL2XC	Timothy Perper	"SPOILERS!!!Well, it's certainly a nice film, upbeat with a happy ending and a simple resolution to an insoluble set of problems. Basically, it's a three-segment TV show, the first segment (Wall-E and Eve) being the best; the second and third introducing the space ship Axiom, its captain, passengers, and robots, and then resolving a conflict between the Captain and his evil robot auto-pilot about returning to Earth for the happy ending. The three segments are loosely linked together by the quasi-romance between Wall-E and Eve set up in the first segment, but there is a real conflict within the film itself between two faces of the story: Wall-E and Eve on a nearly destroyed Earth, and the cartoony battle between the Captain and the minions of the evil auto-pilot.It's easy to be critical about the second and third segments. They're cartoony to the max, they lack character development of any kind for the Captain and the Auto-Pilot, they resolve into the happy ending without any explanations. For example, how come the Captain can transform from an ignorant fat slob to the hero who leads his ship back to Earth? Unlike the subtle and nuanced portrayal of Wall-E and Eve, neither the Captain or the Auto-Pilot have any reasons for what they do. Auto-Pilot is merely evil -- but why should an autopilot program behave like that? -- and is destroyed far too easily for a machine that can operate the entire ship. These flaws are not repaired by frequent references to recent U.S. politics -- the president of the BNL Corporation sounds exactly like George W. Bush; the ""Green"" theme is hand-wavingly clich&eacute;d; the use of commercial themes like the power-up chord of the Mac computer is too local to have any meaning for an isolated world on a spaceship 700 years in the future. In segments two and three, the film makes a wrenching downshift to U.S. television animation, for example, in its much too easy parody of obese Americans lounging in beach chairs.Also notable is the shift in animation technique and meaning between the first segment and the second two. The first is done in ultra-realist animation, in sepia, tans, and browns, with skillful and sometimes strikingly surreal images of huge monuments of compressed trash. Wall-E collects odd remnants of human history, and I was hoping -- vainly, as it turned out -- for a resolution/explanation of his preservation of toys, dolls, a beautifully-rendered Zippo lighter (it still has lighter fluid after 700 years -- a wonderful touch!), and almost poignant clips from old musicals and operettas. But instead of taking Wall-E and Eve on a journey to find what these things mean and to discover why Wall-E collects and treasures them, the film wrenches into the cartoony fat slob Captain -- and we lose all the previous and careful cinematic presentation of a world that seems doomed to die. So there can be no real epiphany of rebirth at the end, because the film-makers abandoned that world for the cartoony fat slob captain.In parallel, the first segment has some impossibilities -- though I'm tempted to call them ""mistakes,"" both factual and cinematic. One is that the world portrayed is not 700 years in the future. The future world of ""Wall-E"" is shown as having at least one seedling and having rain (for example, there's a thunderstorm) -- and in biological reality the world and its garbage-compactor cities of cubes of trash therefore would be an overwhelming mass of greenery (that seedling came from a seed; seeds come from mature trees; there would accordingly be plants everywhere). So we mentally change both the time frame and botanical reality to accept the plausibility the vision we are shown of a world depopulated of humans and inhabited only by cockroaches and robots. Into that world comes Eve -- and we want to know how they will resolve the story. Obviously, fat slob captains are not the answer.So ""Wall-E"" is one-third of a fine -- very good indeed -- setting for a cinematographic story that is not resolved and never reaches the epiphany it deserves. And so we, the viewers, are left at the end smiling and chuckling at the wittiness (?) of animating fat cartoony captains, and are deprived of what could have been a genuinely first-class animated film."	2.0	One-third of a really good film SPOILERS!!!	2008-12-31	15	8	7

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2G3HEJ2WSRZVP	Tivor	"This is by far the BEST movie that Pixar has ever made, hands-down.  If WALL-E is a 5-star movie, then all other Pixar movies are 4-star movies in comparison.  It is that magical.A big part of the magic comes from the fact that the two main characters, robots Wall-E and Eve, barely speak more than one word at a time.  Just about all their lines can be written with just one of these three words: ""Wall-E,"" ""Eve,"" and ""Directive.""  Despite that, through excellent animation and wondrous voice direction, the audience is always aware of exactly what those two robots are thinking and feeling every second.Now, I love movies with good dialogue, and we all love witty banters between characters.  But by their very nature, language -- especially the witty sort -- requires intellectual interpretation before it can appeal to the audience's emotions.  By minimizing the role of language in portraying the relationship between the two robots, Pixar has gone straight to our emotions, and they have succeeded magnificently.Of course, that's not to say that the movie is only about sappy emotions.  The movie also makes a lot of satirical fun at everything from global corporation (everything is Buy n Large, and there is no sign of US government, or any government for that matter), environmentally irresponsible consumerism, cellphone- and television-addicted culture, lethargic and obese general public (and commercial billboards that portray fit models), internet generation who don't know what a book is (and think that pizza grows on trees), so on and so forth.  Plus, there is also a pretty refreshing gender role/stereotype reversal between Wall-E and Eve, especially near the end.Visually, the movie is breathtaking.  Particularly of note are the smoke and particle effects, like the scene early in the movie where Wall-E finds a fire extinguisher.  Jawdroppingly beautiful and realistic.  It makes you want to pull out all other movies with CG smoke effects and yell ""FAKE!!"" at them.  It's amazing how Pixar keeps on finding ways to push the 3D CG envelope.It is not often that a movie exceeds my highest of expectations, and WALL-E did with ease.  You can be sure that before the theatrical run is over, I'll be watching this movie at least one more time.  And then I'll get it when it's released on Bluray.  I do not say this often, but this movie is, without a shred of doubt, a true classic."	5.0	Absolutely magical	2008-06-29	12	10	2

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A4JHEO7H330AF	Tom Brody	"Before WALL-E starts, there is a cartoon short. This cartoon features a baby bunny who works for a magician. The bunny wants a carrot, and most of the cartoon is spent on bunny's efforts to get the carrot. The magician is able to put his hand into a bag, and have it come out of his hat, even when his hat is 20 feet away from him. At one point, the bunny is off to the side of the stage and holding the hat. The magician stuffs his hand in the bag, and it comes out of the hat, but when it comes out it touches an electric socket. The electric shock causes the magician to dance. A couple of members of the orchestra take out a banjo and washboard and play some rapid-fire bluegrass music, to accompany the magician's clogging dance! Yee-hawwww! At another point in the cartoon, a rope hoists a piano up above the stage. As one might expect, it later crashes down with a bang. The bunny-rabbit cartoon is colorful and features many crazy angles. The bunny cartoon is a masterpiece. The bunny cartoon is filled with action, attractive colors, and clever antics. FIVE STARS for the bunny cartoon.Now this is about WALL-E. The movie called ""WALL-E"" is a severe disappointment.The film begins with a robotic trash compactor working in a trash dump near a big city, perhaps Chicago or New York City. The robot lives in a little metal house, situated on the site of the garbage dump. The little house has many interesting things inside, such as amusing knick-knacks that the robot finds and collects, during his daytime job of compacting trash. The robot also likes to watch a Broadway musical (Hello Dolly) that features corny singing and dancing. I liked this part of the movie. I liked the clever knick-knacks in the robot's house, for example, the Rubik's cube.Then, the love interest arrives. It is a probe robot, sent by a colony of humans to seek for plant life on earth, in order to determine if it is safe for the space-bound earthlings to return to earth. The probe robot successfully finds a little plant, provided by Wall-e. The little plant is kept in a child's leather boot. The probe robot has violent instincts, and causes widespread destruction around the trash dump, by way of a ray gun. For example, the probe robot destroys a row of large oceangoing ships, destined for compacting. In fact, Wall-e cringes in fear at the probe robot's indiscriminate use of the ray gun. It is not at all clear why Wall-e falls takes a liking to the violent space probe. At any rate, Wall-e does.When it comes time for the lovely female space probe to return to the mother ship, Wall-e clings to outside of the shuttle ship, and joins the humans on space colony. At this point, we are introduced to the humans who, for 700 years, have done nothing but gain weight, watch television, and eat junk food. There are some typical fights and chase scenes involving Wall-e and the robots in the space station. Another source of conflict is that the automated computer running the space station attempts to take over. (This part of the plot does not fit into the basis premise of the movie. This part of the plot was arbitrarily copied from the Stanley Kubrick classic, 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY).Other reviewers have pointed out that WALL-E contains no dialogue, aside from chirps/squeak sounds of Wall-e and the female space probe. What bothered me was the lack of interesting scenery in WALL-E. Much of the movie is spent in an ugly garbage dump. The garbage dump is a monotonous light brown or orange color. WALL-E dwells extensively on the obesity, consumerism, laziness, excessive eating of junk food, and excess television watching of the people in the space colony. Although there is a grain of truth to this (especially as to obesity), I would not characterize human beings, or American people, as lazy and prone to eating too much junk food or to excessive television watching. Because of the movie's constant dwellings on obesity, laziness, consumerism, and excessive TV watching, I found most of WALL-E to be an insult. The writers of WALL-E failed to understand the virtues of subtlety. WALL-E is simply not cut from the same cloth as other Pixar films, such as Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, or Toy Story 1 and 2."	5.0	Filled with action, attractive bright colors, and clever antics.	2008-07-06	5	3	2

But I was pleasantly surprised at how cute, charming, and socially commentative the entire film was. I'm sure most of us can either empathize or at least cheer from the perspective of a shy, lonesome creature yearning to love and be loved by someone, and this is exactly what WALL-E's character is all about. And as many a review has already stated, it's not just the act of falling in love, but the way it's presented in this particular film. Sure, we've all seen humans go through the usual hoopla that accompanies the act of romance and courtship, but to achieve and present it in a style that uses almost zero dialogue, and instead utilizes sound effects and music is simply astonishing. And then you have the symbolism and social commentary. To me, the vision of this movie goes to prove several things: A) the social disconnect we're slowly leaning towards as represented by The Axiom. Why bother actually interacting face-to-face, going out to play, or for that matter even getting up to walk? It's a frightening, albeit comical and intelligently-written, testament to how I believe we'll eventually come to depend on technology so much, that it will run our lives in another form of autopilot. And who wants that? But also B) with this dependence on technology and the current consumerist mentality most of this world is living with, I have no doubt that Earth may inevitably become as trashed as in this movie and that society will, in a way, bring about its own destruction, if not through war, then through catastrophic environmental negligence. And then finally C) despite all of this negativity, the human spirit is less breakable than you'd think. Change is the nature of universe, and while some change may be for the worst (like the ones that trashed the planet), it's still good to see those intangible characteristics like hope and optimism counteract and balance it all out at the end. The writing for this film is amazing, indeed.Video - 5.0Being another direct transfer of CG to BD, it's easy to see how perfection is the only expectation. With that said, WALL-E looks fantastic. Colors are all over the place, even through all the trash he's digging up on Earth. Shades and hues of various palettes showcase the level of detail flawlessly. Black levels and contrast compliment each other leading to an exuberance of image clarity and depth. In particular, I love how you can see so many of the lines within the compacted blocks of garbage WALL-E stacks up. And scenic views are shimmering when looked at from afar to really give the viewer an awe-inspiring effect of the cinematography. Also as expected, there are no signs of image enhancement or manipulation, aliasing, macroblocking, color banding, or bits of artifacting and debris. WALL-E is yet another A+ video presentation by Disney and should be a no-brainer for reference material.Audio - 5.0Having a DTS-HD MA 6.1 track, you get what you paid for in this fine, fine audio presentation. Dialogue stays clear and centered with no dropout or distortion. Directionality stays mostly in the front sound stage with the busy whirring and buzzing of mechanical equipment, though not to be denied is a great mix of additional sound effects and a wonderful score by Thomas Newman from the front side and speakers. Separation is equally astounding with every single sound being as crisp as you could ever want. The rear channel is mostly music, but on occasion manages to instill some excellent immersion with sound effects as well. High and low ends, and there are a lot, are handled brilliantly considering the amount of work sound designer Ben Burtt put into the project. And finally, LFEs aren't too frequent, but when they engage the subwoofer, they pack quite a punch through the forms of rocket ships, heavy machinery, and a couple of lighting bolts.Extras - 5.0On the feature disc you have two very entertaining Pixar shorts: Presto, about the quarrel between a rabbit and his magician over feeding arrangements, and Burn-E, about that service bot that was left outside the ship during the movie. Both shorts are quite funny for such.. ""short"" presentations (about 5 and 7 minutes respectively), but that's the magic of animation (achievability through small amounts of time). Meanwhile, disc 2 (a 25GB BD) contains a plethora of its own cool features (all in HD) such as mini games, behind-the-scenes featurettes, etc. The ""making of"" material especially caught my interest showing the extremely high level of work and commitment it took to build this movie from the ground up (4 years!), starting with production design, sound & music, CG layering, and all of that other mind blowing hard work. It really gave me a higher sense of appreciation and respect to see just how much effort these people put into the overall project, and I really thank them for doing the diligence.Overall - 5.0I haven't really watched any Disney/Pixar movies since Toy Story, aside from Ratatoullie (my fave of the company, right now), but they seem to really have taken a chance with WALL-E, and it paid off greatly. Some people may not be as in to the speechlessness of the main characters as myself or others, but it certainly struck a high and joyful chord with me, enough to warrant it a full-fledged 5-star rating in every category possible. Video and audio are no-brainers. And if you liked the movie as much as I did, the special features will only prove to show how much greater the effort in making it was. This is a must own for anyone with even slightest cutesy/romantic/light-hearted side to them."	5.0	WALL*E (Blu-ray, 2-Disc Edition)	2009-01-30	1	1	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2TF4THKM503M0	"Tony Kiss ""Dr. Morbius' Id"""	"(NO SPOILERS HERE)Shame on me for ignoring my own rule of thumb and slurping up so many of the gushing reviewslisted here for Wall E.  My expectation going into the theater was somewhere around Pluto, but the film only managed to take me to Saturn.  Normally, Saturn would warrant a rave review, but not when a film falls somewhat short of that ever-so-high bar you carry into the theater.Don't get me wrong. Pixar has hit a home run with Wall E. They just did not hit one out of the park, as so many others here would have you believe. The movie really does work on just about every imaginable level. The Pixar animation team most certainly outdid themselves, taking CGI to an impressive and breathtakingly realistic new level. Wall E IS at times thought-provoking, ironic, laugh-out-loud funny, poignant, entertaining, and perhaps, somewhat romantic. Yes, all of this with a highly original story line and offbeat musical accompaniment. Those elements which are borrowed from other movies are at leastincorporated with a fresh twist.Wall E does have its shortcomings: A little over the top at times in the ""Gee, aren't we just the cutest on screen Bots you've ever seen?"" Department. There are also a couple occasions where the substitution of dialogue for assorted sound effects becomes a bit tedious. Fortunately, the movie is very low key as regards the results of long term ravaging of the environment, not at all in-your-face as so often is the case with movies made in the past few years.Taken as a whole, though, Wall E just doesn't measure up to five stars. Four (maybe 4 and ) seems to me at least, a much more realistic rating. In any case, please, simply put aside the reviews and just go see Wall E, hopefully, leaving your expectations at the door. You'll probably have a very enjoyable and entertaining hour and a half."	4.0	Wall E ( is for Expectation...Don't Read Reviews, Just Go See It!)	2008-07-03	6	3	3

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	"Pixar's computer-animated feature film ""WALL-E"" is three things at once: a thrilling adventure tale, sweet romance and imaginative science fiction. The studio once again shows that what animation can really do with creative artists and cutting-edge techniques.The time is 29th century. Earth is now covered with trash and pollution. The film follows the story of one robot named WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), designed to clean up Earth for humans. However, humankind had left Earth about 700 years ago and the only companion for lonely WALL-E is, not surprisingly, a cockroach.That's when WALL-E meets ""EVE,"" a new type of robot that has come with a huge spaceship. WALL-E doesn't know why EVE is here, whose mission on Earth is not disclosed until the end of the film. But WALL-E doesn't care. WALL-E is happy to watch his favorite film with new friend, a VHS tape of ""Hello Dolly.""But something happens to EVE, who is then taken away into outer space again. WALL-E decides to save EVE no matter what it takes and that's when WALL-E's exciting adventure begins. The storyline is unpredictable and the rest of the film (that may remind you of a Douglas Trumbull film ""Silent Running"", as some reviewers point out) is full of actions that will never bore you until the really touching ending.""WALL-E"" is a romance and adventure story, but taken as science fiction, the film's story and its undertone are slightly dark. WALL-E keeps working briskly as if nothing bothers him (supposing he is a male), but the bleak landscape of the deserted city shows it is almost a miracle that WALL-E survived in the harsh environment and is still operating. You can infer what happened to other WALL-Es by looking at the picture carefully.But what happened to the humankind? It is revealed in the second half of ""WALL-E."" Well, you may not like it, though it is told in a witty and humorous way. It's the world of old Zager and Evans song. Actually the story of ""WALL-E"" could have been turned into a depressing nightmare quite easily, but director Andrew Stanton (""Finding Nemo"") keeps the narrative afloat, tactfully mixing actions and jokes throughout.With its stunningly beautiful visuals and lovely and likable characters that you can identify with, ""WALL-E"" is a masterpiece that well deserves its Oscar award, another proof that Pixar can never do wrong."	5.0	Simply Great	2009-09-11	2	1	1

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A18GP1PWVTKXQQ	Turfseer	"Wall-e has a great concept: Due to the toxic effects of unchecked consumerism, earth becomes a dead planet and humans find themselves in a giant pleasure ship run by robots. This is perhaps the first film I've seen in a long time that takes the politically incorrect position that obesity is not a good thing. In the future, people have all become obese. They sit in pleasure chairs and mindlessly move around the ship on a conveyor belt of sorts, eating junk food and slurping drinks you would find at any fast food outlet today. Giant electronic billboards broadcast news about the latest products and the people of tomorrow all are in a great stupor.Meanwhile back on earth, Wall-e is the last functional robot, a waste compactor assigned to clean up the trash left behind. Earth is a dead planet and the people of earth have fled since nothing can grow there anymore. The mother ship sends out probes searching for signs of life. One such probe is ""Eve"" who Wall-e befriends and then falls in love with. Wall-e ends up finding a small plant which he gives to Eve as a gift. This is the 'evidence' that the humans have been looking for. Now earth is capable of supporting life again and the humans may return. Eve returns to the mother ship with the plant but Wall-e, love stricken, must follow her too. Eventually, the ship's computer confirms that earth can now support life again but not before the robot in charge of guiding the ship revolts at returning and struggles with the human captain for control. The Human Captain finally realizes how great it is to be on earth, gains control of the ship from the rebel robots and brings the mother ship back to earth. Wall-e, damaged from the fight with the rebel robots, is restored to his former self by Eve, who finds some replacement parts, and they live happily ever after.One cannot describe the inventiveness of the animation here. It is truly phenomenal. The effects are dazzling. But one feels that after awhile, some of the scenes are a bit repetitious. For example, there is this small robot who is assigned to cleaning up all the 'foreign contaminants' it finds within the mother ship. The cleanup scenes by this robot are overdone. Similarly, Eve's penchant for blasting anything that gets in her way becomes a little tiresome. Instead of one of two blasting sessions, we get about ten. Act I goes on a little too long. We should have Wall-e get on his adventure sooner (i.e., when he attach's himself to the ship and finds himself in outer space). Another weakness of the script is that the antagonist is not identified clearly enough into much later in the film. Halfway through, the robot controlling the ship suddenly becomes malevolent. That should have been established earlier. In addition, it was a little too easy for the Human Captain to suddenly ""see the light"" and regain his humanity.Wall-e is in the end, an enjoyable but somewhat sentimental love story between two robots. Its human characters are drawn more as comic relief. Had the screenwriters drawn the humans as a bit more multi-dimensional, this could have been a more compelling film. As a romance, Wall-e is cute and sweet. But the overall story will be favored more by comic book aficionados. Walle's dazzling special effects create on a visual level, a feast for the eyes which must be seen."	3.0	A feast for the eyes	2009-03-20	3	3	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A30A2A6VN4KIW2	TV Dude	"Wall-E is an experience that is rarely found in a ""kids'"" movie. On the surface, the film is beautifully constructed, has fantastic sound, and has neat and crazy little robots. Deeper than that is a conflict between role dependence and autonomy. Ironically, the automatons are the ones who teach the humans in the story to expand beyond their programming.The first half of the movie follows Wall-E through his daily life and how he's a robot who has evolved the ability to think, explore, and wonder. Most of the second half of the movie explores how short-sighted humans have left the Earth covered in garbage and retreated to a superstore-sponsored spaceship where robots care for them like infants. These humans are absorbed in a self-centered culture of cell-phones and meaningless entertainment, and are completely devoid of drive to think for themselves, explore, or become more than what they are. Naturally, the course of the movie leads Wall-E to inspire the humans to overcome their social programming of constant entertainment and mindless consumerism and take back control of their destiny.The foundation of the movie is a love story founded on Wall-E's undying devotion to a swanky I-Pod-esque robot named Eve, and reminds us that love is one of the most potent forces of change in the universe.Wall-E the movie is just as inspiring as the robot himself, and it holds a fantastic message."	5.0	Brilliant.	2008-07-10	8	6	2

Solution is to insert the inner box backwards, but it shouldn't have been necessary.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1XBYZX09V1OB4	Valerie J. Saturen	"The geniuses at Pixar have done it again with this extremely cute, touching, and socially conscious movie. Wall-E--short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class--is an adorable, vaguely ET-like robot whose job is cleaning up trash by pressing it into cubes. Since the future Earth he inhabits has been rendered uninhabitable by enormous garbage heaps, Wall-E has only a cockroach for companionship; all humans have fled the planet on ""space vacations"" and have remained in space for 700 years. In the course of this long absence, they have grown used to an effortless yet artificial existence and have forgotten all about their once-beautiful home, but a miraculous discovery gives Wall-E a chance to bring them back.One of the most unique accomplishments of this movie is the characterization and animation of Wall-E. Although he is very much a robot, Wall-E endears us with his very expressive and human mannerisms. He is full of robot wonder at the things humans have discarded, adding his favorites to a collection, and he falls in love with another robot, EVE, who visits the planet in search of signs of life. What is especially impressive is that all of this takes place with very little dialogue. Throughout the movie, Wall-E only learns to utter a few words, but he still ""says"" very much.Beneath the cute love story is a message about the effects of unbridled consumerism. Not only has the planet been overrun with waste, but the space-vacationing people have been made so lazy by technology that they are morbidly obese and unable to get out of their hover chairs. As their spaceship (owned by the mega corporation Buy 'n' Large) runs on autopilot, they simply sit and float, scarfing down food shakes from the Regurgitated Food Buffet and chatting via video screens. So wrapped up are they in these activities that they forgo not only exercise but any sort of interaction with each other.This is yet another wonderful family movie from Pixar. No matter your age, it is impossible not to fall in love with Wall-E and with this magical film."	5.0	More Genius from Pixar	2008-12-03	1	1	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3JLOIXFM75QNV	"Valerya Couto ""LOTRsherlockHPFreak"""	On the big screen, this looked fantastic. Pixar just gets better and better, their movies more enjoyable and truly innovative. They are pure geniuses. Wall-E is a very sweet and simple film. While both children and adults will enjoy it, there are certain elements that only older people will 'get'. It deals with something that could possibly be a reality here on Earth in the not so distant future. That said, the humans in this film are utterly hilarious and I can so picture the type of future that they live in. It's already starting to happen here, without a doubt. It really goes to show how laziness can affect someone. I really loved that aspect of this film.Wall-E himself is just the cutest robot ever created. Again, alot of research obviously went into creating him and it shows. You can't help but fall in love with him. There is a scene towards the end that is heartbreaking and it still amazes me that you can get this emotional over something that is not flesh and blood.The visuals are stunning. Probably the best ever for Pixar or anything not live action. The desolate earth landscape with the ever-present garbage and debris is almost hauntingly real looking.That said, many people are calling this the greatest Pixar movie to date, but I disagree. The Incredibles by far surpasses this, storywise. It had more action and suspense and surprises. Wall-E is a far more simpler film, but still a fantastic one that deserves multiple viewings. Even if the plot is lacking somewhat, Wall-E himself sure isn't, and it's enough to watch it just to see him in action.	5.0	Wonderfully unique	2008-09-01	8	5	3
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2FWM7FQVAQ5V9	Valley Val AZ	"Earth is overrun with garbage and is uninhabitable.  WALL-E's job is to compact garbage and stack it into towers (WALL-E = Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class).  He spends his night finding uses for interesting items he finds during the day and watching the musical, ""Hello Dolly.""  although he is a robot, the monotony, isolation, and loneliness show on his little robot face.Then, a visitor.  EVE is left there by a spacecraft, apparently on a scouting mission, but what is she looking for? WALL-E's attempts to befriend her are futile - she's on a mission! EVE spots one of WALL-E's finds and that's when the real adventure begins.Fast forward to The Axiom: Weeble-like people in a uniform, commercialized world, drinking their meals in a cup.  This is a world where everyone and everything literally stays within the lines (ON the line, to be exact). WALL-E becomes an unlikely hero for those who choose to not stay on the line.This movie is well done: touching, funny with a clever plot, and it is a great movie to watch with your kids.  They will love the pretty colors and the slapstick comedy (WALL-E and other characters fall and bump into things a lot).  Plus, there's an interesting enough storyline and humor (and pretty colors) to keep the adults interested.After seeing this movie, I regret having not seen it in a theatre - watching the DVD at home did not do the amazing visuals justice. It's Pixar, so I expected superior graphics and they did not disappoint.  At the beginning of the movie, there's not much dialogue, which made the soundtrack all the more important.  Most of the music is by Thomas Newman and it is at times sweeping, whimsical, airy, and jazzy.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A3PNBDW3Q5AUFM	"VCanete ""Victor Canete"""	"Pixar can truely dazzle us with their incredibly remarkable animated films. Ever since they changed the world of film with their 1995 film ""Toy Story"", they went on to have many other unforgettable movies (A Bug's Life, Monsters, Inc, and The Incredibles), but after I saw their 2008 masterpiece ""WALL-E"", It has becomed my most favorite Pixar movie ever. With it's wonderfully combined story of science fiction, action, romance and its environmental message, it will win anyone over.The film opens in the year 2805 with the little robot WALL-E who is the only one of his kind when Earth is just a abandoned planet completely covered in garbage, while his job is to clean the planet by forming the garbage into cubes and stacking them together. The reason of the Earth's trashy problem is that almost 700 years ago when a mega-corporation call Buy-N-Large has damaged the environment with its numerous consumer products, that it's plan was to clean the Earth with their army of WALL-E cleaning bots, but when the plan failed and the planet started to grow too toxic, BNL had no choice but to bring humanity to space as a last resort. Now with the planet still in trash, WALL-E continues to clean it up, and while doing so, he finds many great treasures as well (ex. Rubik's cube, Twinkies, iPods, Zippo lighters, car alarms, ring cases, fire extinguishers, etc.). Later, he unexpectedly sees a spaceship land where he works and out comes a sleek white egg-shaped robot probe called EVE, and in no time WALL-E falls ""head over wheels"" for her and shows her what he does, but when he shows her a living plant that he found, she turns off completely and when the spaceship retrives her, WALL-E will go a ride and then goes on a journey that will determine the fate of humanity and robots as well.I'll start by saying that in the first minute of the film, ""WALL-E"" immediately won me over. Ever since then, I've seen it so many times that i pretty much know the entire movie. Pixar has given us something completely different, that will entertain both kids and adults. The kids will love the funniness and cuteness of WALL-E, EVE, and all the other robots they'll meet and see. Adults will love the superb storytelling, the wonderful score,the romance between WALL-E and EVE, and the nature of the movie, even though no dialogue is spoken for nearly 40 minutes. But importantly, ""WALL-E"" also gives us a envirormental message to protect our Earth, and to take care of it for a better future. But no matter what, ""WALL-E"" will always have a special place in my heart."	5.0	The Best Animated Masterpiece Ever. Period.	2012-05-20	2	2	0

The premise of Wall-E is a little off the mark, but should serve its purpose in an entertain aspect for children. This film is full of humor and plot points typical of other Pixar films. The animation is top notch as always, but I would like to see a Pixar film that displays human characters as realistic as possible and not as rounded cartoons.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1C80B497LCYKA	"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark"""	"Filmmaker Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo) says Wall-e is not about the environment or obesity, but about relationships. Not to dispute the director, but isn't that what all romantic comedies, if not all films - if not all stories - are about? The romance between Wall-e and Eve is obviously the heart of the film. But the PLOT is about something else. So, even though the filmmakers were not consciously making a movie about the environment or obesity, Wall-e is about our present culture and how we are ruining ourselves and our planet by our obsession with instant gratification.For those who aren't aware, Wall-e is a very likable little robot that is part of a mechanized effort to clean up earth, while its inhabitants take an extended 5-year cruise aboard a fleet of luxury space ships, headed by one called the Axiom. Unfortunately, the project breaks down so that only Wall-e is left to finish the work, and the 5-year cruise has turned into 700 years! (I don't think Skipper and Gilligan need ever be ashamed again over their cruise going awry!)The Axiom sends a probe to earth to discover if there is any plant life remaining. When Wall-e meets the robot, Eve, whose directive (responsibility) is to acquire the specimen, love ensues. Eventually she does find one plant, which signals the probe to come back to pick her up. But Wall-e isn't about to let the love of his life disappear, so he stows away on the probe.When the probe reaches the mother ship, we discover that, over the course of the past 700 years, humans have become lazy, bloated floating couch potatoes. There is a plan in place that, should plant life be discovered on earth, the captain of the ship is to return to earth with his passengers. But someone wants to sabotage that plan by getting rid of the evidence of the plant. Wall-e and his girlfriend-robot try to save the plant and thus the plan.My favorite part of the film is the time spent in Wall-e's home. Like me, he's a collector, and his home if full of all the interesting objects he's found over the course of his career as a garbage robot: everything from extra parts in order to make repairs to himself, to a rubik's cube, a light bulb, a cigarette lighter and Christmas lights (all of which figure significantly in his relationship with Eve). His favorite find is an old VHS copy of Hello Dolly, which he cherishes religiously. He plays and hums one song in particular all day long while working with his best friend, an indestructible roach.I believe most guys will fully appreciate Wall-e, because he really speaks to the little boy in all of us - but I think he speaks to most women as well. I mean, what little boy wouldn't love rummaging through a really interesting garbage dump finding all kinds of neat gadgets and treasures they can keep? Maybe there are many little girls that feel the same way; but I think what most girls, young and old, will like best about Wall-e is the little robot's thoughtfulness: he would make a good friend.In spite of the wonderful romance and in spite of the character of the little robot Wall-e - or maybe because of them - I think what's most important about this film is the message it relays about what will happen to us culturally if we continue down this road of self-indulgent consumerism. The floating couch potatoes aboard the cruise ship spend their days in front of a screen, talking with their friends and sipping Buy-N-Large beverages. (Buy-N-Large is the mega company behind the rampant consumerism.) They don't even realize there are swimming pools and jogging tracks onboard the ship because they are so ""plugged in"" to their consumption and so out-of-touch with what is going on around them.It's an important message. So, whether rampant consumerism, resulting in an environmental wasteland and an obese society, is the main plot or a subplot, it is an important takeaway, as is how we treat each other. The relationship between the two main robots is obviously the centerpiece of the film, and their expressions and gestures are not only priceless, they are genius, because they are so human. I would also add that another important message is the importance of seeing the value in everything and everyone, rather than being so quick to throw them away. Wall-e is definitely a role model for that, even to the point of being best friends with a roach!

While I don't think you need to watch it that many times to really get it, I think you do need to watch it at least twice.

This was the very first movie my three year old son ever watched and it quickly became his favorite - so much so he named his special sleep toy ""Eve.""

Forget to use any meaningful dialogue throughout the film. Use songs from the 1960's with which children cannot begin to identify. Show earth as a desolate planet. Take Wall-E's purpose of making garbage cubes and repeat it over and over. Bore little children, whose parents thought they were bringing their kids to a quality family movie. Love story? Oh, yes, children really like a love story between two robotic personalities who don't talk. Lastly, everyone has got to be attracted to a film with fat people floating around, being too lazy to care for themselves. Ah, that captain figure was really something.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	"What else can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? It reminds me of the comedies that Buster Keaton did and what he might have done with the technology we have now--very little dialog during the first half but full of character and emotion. Wall-E is the last of his kind; a robot designed to clean up an Earth that we have ruined. The rest of humanity has taken to the stars until Earth is cleaned up. 700 years later, Wall-E is still at it (which gives you an idea about how bad it was)when EVE arrives--another robot unit designed to find evidence of life and return it to the Axiom the ship housing our overweight, consumer obsessed descendants.The extras on the one disc version are quite good (I wouldn't spring for the three disc and as much abuse as this disc will get in my home I wouldn't spring for the pricy Blu-ray either)including ""Presto"" a delightful short that echoes the best Bugs Bunny/Elmer Fudd cartoons that Warner produced involving a rabbit, a magician and an act that has gone awry. ""Burn-E"" focuses on one of the service robots that we see in the movie. It's quite clever if less inspired.Other special features include deleted scenes, a ""sneak peak"" of ""Wall-E's Tour of the Universe"", a featurette on the sound design by Ben Burtt (who also did Wall-E's voice and created all of those wonderful sound effects for R2D2) as well as a commentary track by Director Andrew Stanton that is quite informative covering everything from the conception/changes to characters and storylines that they chose not to pursue.The 3 disc set evidently has a full documentary on Pixar and its history made by Leslie Iwerks the goddaughter of the great Disney animation pioneer Ub Iwerks.The DVD transfer looks wonderful.The packaging sucks. I understand that it IS important to send a message with eco-friendly packaging but the packaging on this looks like it was designed by someone who failed design school. THe disc will float around inside, get scratched (ours already was by the way)when it could just as easily been kept the same IF a small piece of plastic had been put (or even an adhesive spindle for the DVD)inside the packaging. It's a mixed message--a good movie with horrible packaging that will make sure that the disc is damaged with repeated use. It's a good thing I didn't spring for the more expensive set.Four stars for the movie, 1 star for the packaging. I'd suggest renting it if you want to see it once and then if you decide to buy it you might as well purchase one of those wasteful ecologically unsound DVD holders at a local retailer to store it in (the other option is a DVD plastic envelope)."	4.0	"Very good movie, horrible packaging (even if it is ""eco-friendly"")"	2008-11-19	11	11	0

A nice way to introduce this endearing robot of the future. Just had to love Wall E's little mate, the cockroach! it wasn't hard to have immediate empathy with Wall E, as I found him to be a cute mechanical 'ugly duckling' who exuded love and craved companionship.Naturally the underlying theme of waste dumping, conservation and human lack of exercise and commitment, add to the simple 'Romeo & Juliet' love story between two robots who have humanoid feelings. I enjoyed the tale and had a few good laughs, in spite of the darker undertones of the tale referring to the possible 'end of civilization' because of lazy humanity.A nice flight of fantasy, and sci-fi, mixed together with a nice romance. A good evening's entertainment.A delightful film, and great value, with the fun add-ons included in the DVD. if you have a universal DVD player, then you can play this on your DVD in Australia (as we did)or in the UK etc.Love you Wall E!	4.0	A chunk of metal on wheels, pull the heart strings!	2009-01-23	1	1	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A4UKBG3M5U5TI	Westley	"I'm not a huge fan of animated films, but I was completely blown away by ""Wall-E.""  The story is simple - a lowly trash-collecting robot is the last remaining inhabitant of earth until a probe robot lands; romance blossoms.  What makes ""Wall-E"" so special is Wall-E, the robot who persistently (stubbornly?) continues cleaning earth 700 years after his assignment ended.  Over the years, Wall-E has developed a human-like curiosity and personality.  As he cleans (scooping trash into his body and turning it into a compact cube), he runs across items that intrigue him - a spork, a lighter, a rubrik's cube, a cassette of ""Hello Dolly!""  He takes them back to his home (a truck) that he shares with his pet, a nameless cockroach.  These scenes portray heart-breaking loneliness and isolation better than any movie with human actors; they make ""Wall-E"" a work of art.After he meets the probe robot, Eve, he falls in love.  He tries vainly to get her attention, but she's far more advanced and has no time for a silly trash compactor.  However, his persistence is once again his strength, and she eventually takes notice of him.  The first time they speak to each other is one of the sweetest scenes in movies, and Wall-E's longing is more palpable than you'll see in any given flavorless romantic comedy.  The movie then shifts to a grander scale, as Wall-E follows the probe into space and meets the humans who abandoned earth.  Some of these space scenes are as grand as anything filmed by David Lean, with Wall-E always adding a touch of humanity to each scenario.  Superficially, Wall-E may seem like a cross between ET and R2-D2, but he's unique.""Wall-E"" isn't just the best animated film ever, which I think it is.  The movie is bound to become a timeless classic, transcending the ""cartoon"" label.  There are very few movies in history that are better plotted or that are, ironically, more human.  The fact that the creators sneak in a timely ""eco-friendly"" plot is just a plus; ""Wall-E"" doesn't need to be topical when it's so brilliant."	5.0	Greatest animated film ever	2008-11-23	1	1	0

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	ARFCORBCTKX1J	"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer"""	"The first 40 (or so) minutes of this film are a wonder. There is no point in trying to describe it, you have to see it. It is above and beyond criticism. Chaplin and Keaton (whom the eponymous character resembles) would have loved it.The rest of the film bothers me, which is why I've given it only four stars. I do this because Pixar takes its storytelling very, very seriously, and I see no reason not to critique it accordingly.The idea that a lazy, poorly educated humanity that has been pampered for 700 years would want -- or even be willing -- to return to Earth, to restore it, is not plausible. A single century, during which the original population and its direct memories of Earth, would have passed on, would have been sufficient time. That was all the time the inhabitants of North America needed to realize they were Americans, not British citizens.The ""moral"" of the film -- that people can and must stand on their own two feet, and lead their own lives -- is a good one. But had I been directing it, I would have had the humans continue their pointless lives on the Axiom, with WALL-E and EVE returning alone to Earth. The film appeals to what we would like to think about ourselves, not how we really are.I am also obliged to criticize the film's almost overwhelming intensity, particularly during the last half. It moves along at near-breakneck speed, with no ebb and flow, no slackening so that one might build up to an even greater intensity (psychologically, if not literally). Beethoven and Wagner understood this. Andrew Stanton does not.There's a wonderful Twinkies joke, so good it's done twice. Note the absolutely adorable (there's no other word for it) way it's handled the second time. (Pixar tends not to shove things in the viewer's face, so you might miss it.)There are many factual and scientific errors (WALL-E plays a VHS tape in U-matic machine; there is no up and down and space to reference artificial gravity to), but these do not significantly detract from this film's appeal.The entire film is worth seeing once, but I suspect many adult purchasers will, on repeat viewings, shut off the player when WALL-E reaches the Axiom.

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A39NXAD50F6YVZ	Winston Smith	"Reading reviews of this film, most of the focus seems to be on the first half, set on a planet despoiled by pollution and garbage (a common theme in science fiction). Blame is assigned to mega-corporation ""Buy-N-Large"" (read: Wal-Mart) and a culture of conspicuous consumption.But as we move off-world to the floating luxury spaceship Axiom, mankind's lifeboat, we find that Buy-N-Large is no longer merely a big-box store but has now assumed the role of an all-powerful ""nanny-state"" government.The so-called ""consumers"" are still consuming endlessly, but without any visible means to PAY for this consumption. No one is BUYING anything from Buy-N-Large anymore. On the contrary, Buy-N-Large seems to be providing an endless supply of services to its ""customers"" (more like ""subjects""), from cradle to grave. The result is a docile population that is unmotivated, uneducated and unproductive.Such a scenario would spell disaster for a mere big-box store, which is entirely dependent on its customers' spending in order to stay afloat. But the coersive goverment entity that Buy-N-Large has become is only made more powerful by a completely dependent population that can no longer think or provide for themselves.Just as The Incredibles, in addition to being an superhero movie, was also a clever critique of the tyranny of political correctness and frivolous lawsuits, WALL-E manages to be a romantic comedy about robots, as well as a cautionary tale about the dangers of an all-encompassing nanny state."	4.0	WALL-E: The dangers of big government	2008-07-29	11	9	2
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1MRPX3RM48T2I	Winter	"Pixar has done it again, knocking the proverbial ball out of the park with WALL-E, a fun, funny, science fiction action romance with a big heap of message.  WALL-E, the main character, is a tiny trash robot.  You get the impression that he is the last functioning unit of his kind on Earth, and that the WALL-Es were left behind to clean up all the garbage while humanity took to the stars.Enter EVE, the robot whose sudden appearance in WALL-E's life gives him a new hope:  companionship and love.  I don't want to give away the fun and clever plot that carries forward from there, but I will tell you that this film does an excellent job of keeping the child-level of the film action-packed for the boys and sentimental and sweet for the girls:  this was an excellent Valentine's Day movie for my family.  It also keeps the adults amused with the underlying social / environmental statement using periodic nods to ""2001:  A Space Odyssey"".The Blu-Ray disc is well worth the extra dough--details and colors in this movie are extremely clear and sharp, and various little things, from particle effects to light and focus, come across vividly on Blu-Ray.  This edition of the Blu-Ray adds a lot of fun, throwing in deleted scenes with and without commentary, some entertaining ""arcade-style"" games that take you back to the '80s (clear knock-offs of ""Asteroids"" and ""Burgertime"" can be found), behind-the-scenes, documentaries, and a digital copy of the movie that you can download.Two cons to this disc:1) BD-Live content apparently requires you create an online account, log in, etc....I didn't feel like doing that2) The disc tries to implement ""Disney Fast-Forward"", a way of launching all the content in order, from Previews to the movie to launching bonus materials afterwards.  I found myself jumping out of that fairly quickly after it ran previews, then more previews, then commercials...you get the idea.  Bleah.If you like science fiction and you're a fan of Pixar films, you'll find WALL-E enjoyable.  Moral messages can get obnoxious in films, but this one doesn't really conk you on the head with soapboxing, it instead takes a gentle poke at our society and culture similar to the jibes in Over the Hedge."	5.0	My God...it's Full of Stars!	2009-02-20	2	1	1

This time, we have a children's movie, ecofable, consumerist caution, a little engine that could (for seven hundred years at a stretch), duty and loyalty, and a lot more.First, of course, we have Wall-E himself. Ever since ""Luxo Junior,"" Pixar has led the field in bringing odd little inanimate objects to life. Here, the Wall-E character is a hard-working robot, battered and scuffed. He trundles to work every day, patiently cleaning up the millenial trash-heap left behind when people decided they had messed Earth up too much to live there anymore. In addition to the sad collection of tarnished treasures he finds in the litter, his dumpster-diving collects the hoard of spare parts that save his battered carcass from collapse.Then, into this Cinderella life, Princess Charming arrives, a white knight on a fiery steed, and carrying one heck of a lance. You'll just have to see the rest yourself - this really defies easy summary. Stereotypes keep coming up, like the evil grand vizier undermining the lawful ruler, but always with twists that keep them fresh. And, in the end, there are happy endings all around.No one will come to this movie for subtle sophistication. Still, this movie offers plenty to the grown-ups who paid for the tickets. It's a kids' movie, but not just for kids.-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release"	5.0	Wonderful in many ways	2008-07-01	14	8	6
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A16E4663JCYR5E	"wisegirl ""wisegirl"""	I purchased Wall-e as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and was disappointed when I noticed that the package they shipped the movie in contained the name of the movie on the outside of the package. Since my boyfriend checked the mail, he inadvertently found out what his birthday present was before his birthday. It's not just that my boyfriend new what his gift was before his birthday, but I don't think it's a great idea to announce what's in a package for security purposes. What if someone stole it because they knew what was inside?	3.0	Unhappy with packaging/shipping	2008-12-28	3	2	1
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A1AQALH3SMXVGO	Witsend	I've tried two copies of this movie from Amazon and both skip/hang multiple times within the first 15 minutes of the movie.  After the first 15 minutes, the movie plays perfectly.  I've had the issue on my PS3 and Gateway laptop.  Oddly enough, it works perfectly on my very old standalone DVD player and Honda Odyssey built-in DVD player.  I don't know what Disney has done, but I've never experienced this with any of their other DVDs.Update 1/6: I called Disney (1-800-723-4763) and they are aware of some copies of disc 1 (of the 3 disc set) that have the issue I've described.  They are sending me a pre-paid return envelope and will swap me disc 1 for one they guarantee works.  I'll update when I receive and test the replacement copy.Update 1/31: The replacement disc Disney sent appears to work perfectly.  I've only tested the sections that were bad on the previous disc(s), but all in all it appears this disc doesn't have the same skipping issues.  Disney sent the one-disc version (packaging and all), so it appears the one-disc version didn't have the same issues as the 3 disc version of disc 1.	2.0	2 copies tried ... both skip several times in first 15 minutes	2009-01-03	9	7	2

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A2CYMGGXS5QPJT	Yay for Music!	"CAUTION: REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS!!At first glance (as well as the first time I saw previews for this film) I was thinking ""Oh boy, not another dumb Disney film with pointless characters and overdone CGI.""Not so! In fact, this film is the furthest from that. Yes, if you take the film at face-value, sure enough you'll find that the above statement is 100% true. On the other hand, if you take the opportunity and time (not, by the way-wasted) you'll find that this film is layered with comments about our current society and its possible future problems.But first, let me give a premise for the film:This film is as much about a little robot named Wall-E and his adventure in finding the people who left earth and bringing them back, as well as finding his first crush, Eve.Within the film are several product placements: Eve- who represents the Mac and Wall-E who represents the PC in some ways (except for his recharging sound being the sound of a  Mac computer-starting up). The contrast of course is this sleek, shiny, clean, new robot who arrives and Wall-E for the first time realizes, for better or for worse, how desolate his job really is.Wall-E, unlike his fellow workers (also called ""Wall-E"") has outlasted the 700 years of sandstorms and garbage pick-up. With Eve's arrival, Wall-E finally has someone to share his world (and collection of human utensils) with. He shows her a number of items- all commonly used today- but not on the Star-Liner ""The Axiom"" where all food and beverages are drunk through a cup (gross).After Eve presents her finding- (the plant Wall-E originally found for his collection on Earth and showed to Eve) to the Captain and the AUTO-Pilot, a mutiny begins to brew. The AUTO-Pilot is on his own directive to never allow humans to return to earth. Whereas Eve is determined to take the plant to the hollow-detector. Wall-E, not understanding this, causes chaos and confusion among the orderly robots and ship. Eventually it is the chaos of Wall-E and Eve's final acceptance of Wall-E's naivete and at the end- courage to help her fulfill her directive.Now, the aesthetic creativity in this film begins with the first 30 minutes of the film being silent except for Wall-E's occasional noises. Otherwise there is no dialogue until their trek to the AXIOM. The film is full of subtleties: for example- when the Probe-Ship leaves the Earth it blasts through an atmosphere of satellites and probes. Yes, our lovely ""Blue"" earth does look like that. We've been shooting so much junk or trash into space (like the Giant Wall-E bots do on the AXIOM)that our Earth looks like it's been infested with satellitis (satellite disease, not an actual disease- but still).Additionally, the U.S. in particular has a huge laziness and technology problem. This is made evident by the fact that the entire AXIOM's activities are virtual and the people interact through computers and screens when their friends or family are right next to them. No one is aware of their ability to walk or that there are such things as a pool.Basic terms and foods become obsolete in the future because robots have replaced our need to do things ourselves. Wall-E's chasing of Eve (and as a result the uniting of two people: Mary and John- who experience real emotions for the first time- and interaction face to face without a console in between).Also, the film has amazing sounds, an incredible score, and the closing song ""Down to Earth"" by Peter Gabriel tops the charts! The DVD includes commentary on the film as well as on the sounds made in the film. Find out how the makers created Eve's laser or the ship's sound as it takes off from Earth! (It's really amazing- some are even so simple it's funny).I could name all the references in the film (I've bought this very DVD)and watched it many times. I can see no reason why it can't be viewed on the same par as the Best Picture Nominations.In fact, I think it is the best film of the year and deserves to win all six of its nominations as well as Best Picture.So, maybe you've seen it once and went ""Well, there's no talking..."" I'd say ""SHUT UP AND WATCH THE FILM!"" Because it is a piece of artwork and not another Hollywood entertainer with overdone CGI and doesn't require you to think.Think you must, Talk you mustn't. - Is what Yoda would have said if he saw this film."	5.0	Kid's Movie or Social Commentary?

7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"Some movies are good because they take a tried and true formula and add a unique twist.  Others are good because they do something completely different and unexpected.  ""Wall-E"" falls squarely into the latter category.The story is simple: In a post-apocalyptic world, a trash-collecting robot (WALL-E) wanders the desolate terrain.  One day, a visitor (EVE) descends from the heavens and involves WALL-E in a wild adventure to once more bring life to the barren planet.This entire film is so different from anything Disney/Pixar had produced to that point, yet the overall quality is still top-notch.  The story is simple (yet charming), the characters are innocent (halfway in you'll forget that you're essentially watching robots), and the visuals are both unique and spectacular at the same time.Perhaps the hallmark of this fun little film, however, are the numerous sights gags it perpetuates.  The Disney/Pixar team knew that since the fare was robots, the ""goofiness"" factor could be upped for this effort.  On multiple occasions, whether you're four or forty-four, you'll find yourself chuckling at something that just transpired on-screen.Thus, I highly recommend watching this film with the kiddie of your choice.  It toes the line between the intellectual humor of Toy Story and the slapstick of Finding Nemo, all the while providing genuine laughs and heart along the way."	5.0	One Of A Kind, To Be Sure	2011-07-25	0	0	0
7883706837	Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)	A31MKVJBGH3MF4	Zeek	I have no idea how this movie gets the praise it does. After watching the movie for 25 minutes it became unbearable to continue to watch. I normally like some bad movies because they are occasionally fun to make fun of while watching but this movie was such a let down its hard to put into words. No action no talking just a whole lot of boring mundane things taking place. I'm sorry no I don't care about my vacuum cleaner why should I care about Wall E? It is not emotional it is not mesmerizing it is not some sort of paradigm shift that people make it out to be where you get so emotionally tied to the characters. Additional dialog was definitely needed and no most kids that watch this will wonder if the sound is broken and why there is some stupid looking robot moving around on screen so don't expect to pop this movie in and get a two hour break. For those that enjoy this movie great for those would like something a little more ground breaking and entertaining try some anime movies there a few great ones out there like Akira or Princess Mononoke.	1.0	Why All The Praise	2012-11-19	13	2	11
