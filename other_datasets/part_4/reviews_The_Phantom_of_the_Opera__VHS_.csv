B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	"(3.5) Going into a musical, one expects to open one's senses.  Andrew Lloyd Webber, not quite at the height of his powers, gives us a few reasons to celebrate his musical brought to the screen in Joel Schumacher's rendition of `Phantom of the Opera'.There are two main interlocking stories, and while they give one another meaning, they sometimes are conflicting to the musical's spirit.  In front of the stage, Andre (Simon Cowell) has acquired the Paris Opera House.  He must keep everyone happy, particularly his siren voiced prima donna beauty, Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson).  She now must compete with her understudy, the equally alluring and talented, Christine (Emmy Rossum).  At night, darkness takes over as she is seduced by the mysterious ""Phantom"" (Gerard Butler).  He takes her beyond the underground of the city's sewers to his own lair.  However, like the classic story, his love of beauty reaches a vengeful crescendo.  The scenes where the two are together are filled with tenderness with Webber's songs truly suited for the occasion.  Chills run down one's spine during this element of the movie, but compared toCats - The Musical (Ultimate Edition), Webber doesn't provide this often enough.Schumacher's careful shooting is impeccable.  The camera turns in a cemetery scene are nearly flawless and the art direction is superb.  The focus, lighting, and framing are what all musicals should contain.  Besides the accomplished voices of Rossum and Richardson, both leading ladies have a breathtaking beauty.  Matched by early performances by Butler and Wilson, the movie provides hunky handsomeness for women as well.  There's a lot to look at in this beautiful film.My main criticism is that some of the best elements are punctured by the main story.  We need to see the front of the stage to appreciate the backstage developments, but some of ""the show must go on"" sentiments and songs go better with `A Chorus Line,' but not here.  A comparison with the best musicals, including 'The Sound of Music,' 'Oliver!' 'An American in Paris,' `Amadeus,' and the recent release of 'Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,' all point to a story and song venue that resonate much better throughout.As a sensual feast, 'Phantom of the Opera' belts the best notes through the opera house; as a vehicle for the best songs and best story execution, the venue falters in places and makes all the atmospherics go flat.  I fault no one for their enthusiasm for this film, but the cohesiveness is spotty due to some of it's failings.A J.P.'s Pick 3.5 *'s=Good-Very Good"	3.0	Sensual Feast with Songs for a Beast	2008-07-29	9	6	3
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3FV933KPQHTZV	555	This is a very faithful adaption, not to the book, but to the original musical on stage. The actors, despite the critcs' iffy reviews, were amazing in all aspects, as well as the sets, costumes, and cinematography. Joel Schumacer didnt do a very good directing job, but who cares about him anyways. The only thing i'd like to warn buyers is that if they want some AWESOME bonus material, go to amazon.co.uk and buy their DVD. The UK version has everything the US one has, and more...MUCH more. Endless featurettes on the sound, jewelry, prodution, 4 promotional music videos, and more. So anyways, this is still a great movie, and makes me cry everytime I see it because the story alone is just so beautiful and heart-rending.	5.0	Best movie ever...BUYERS BEWARE	2005-06-27	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ASCWUTYEU9BOG	Aaron T Smith	So after about a year of trying to get me to watch this, my wife finally won the battle. I've never really enjoyed musicals and despise opera. I settled in for what I thought was a long, boring movie but was pleasantly surprised with the way the movie intertwined two stories that reels you in right from the first scenes. Past and present come together to form a very intriguing storyline. The music was very good as well and fit well into the storyline. Although, I began to roll my eyes everytime a person began singing, I was immediately drawn back in by the quality of the song, acting, and story. This is one movie that I will definitely recommend!	5.0	Surprisingly Good!	2014-05-04	0	0	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AZGLLJ3TIFOOT	A. Ayre	If you love Phantom from the stage show, you will be very disappointed with the quality of the singing in this movie.  If they were going to lip sync anyway, why didn't they hire spectacular singers?  The only shining star is Raoul.  The rest are weak at best, except the voice over for Carlotta (Minnie Driver plays the character).  I love the stage show and the music CD but this is a big disappointment.  The costumes and special effects are well done but when the show is all about the music and that part is lacking, the costumes and special effects don't really matter.	2.0	Stage show lovers don't buy this dvd.	2007-02-25	6	2	4

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AMDTG2H4PPLKH	"abcool100 ""abcool100"""	Phantom of the Opera, is one of my favorite movies EVER!!  The songs are great, the characters are amazing, and the actors and actresses themselves made this movie awesome.  I've watched this movie more times than I have fingers, so that goes to show how much I love it.  This is the only movie that I've bought with my own money, + the soundtrack.Patrick Wilson is amazing.  I love his smooth voice when he sings, and these confused looks he gets on his face when he talks to Christine about the Phantom. Should've been nominated for Best Supporting Actor somewhere, even if not the Oscars.Emmy Rossum is absolutely fantastic in this movie.  At the age of sixteen she absolutely showed that she has one of the brightest futures in Hollywood right now.  She totally stole the show.  Her voice is so powerful, and you can feel how frightened she is as she sings and speaks of the Phantom. I love that girl!!Gerard Butler is the most amazingly talented, (plus amazingly hot), actor that I have seen from this century so far.  You can feel his emotions when he sings the songs even when you are only listening to the soundtrack.  When you see it on screen, it totally rips my heart out to see his eyes, his tears and his love for Christine.  If it were up to me, I would've given him some recognition for his splendid take on the misunderstood Phantom.Recommended for anyone who enjoys a good musical, and possibly a good cry, too.  100 out of 10 stars for me!!	5.0	The Best Musical EVER!!!	2006-07-18	8	5	3
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2S59UCZM6XUAE	"A. BOSS ""AEB"""	I had purchased the DVD version of this several years ago, and as my review of that version says, rated it highly. I bought the Blue Ray version to compare it to my older DVD and see if it was enough better to justify buying BlueRay versions of some of the DVDs I already owned. I did a 3 way comparison, switching back & forth among the 3 modes as I watched. Mode 1 was the DVD in non-upconverted form, 2 was the DVD upconverted to 1080, and 3 was the BlueRay disk. Although the greatest improvement was between modes 1 & 2, mode 3 was noticeable better than 2. Mode 3 had much sharper detail, especially in the darker areas.For new purchases, I would certainly recommend buying the BlueRay version where it is available even if it cost more, although upconverted DVDs are almost as good and in most cases I would not spend the money to replace DVDs I already had with the BlueRay version.	5.0	Great recording of excellent musical	2009-01-30	0	0	0

The deep sadness of the character finally comes through and the story takes on a new dimension thanks to the performance of Mr. Butler.The entire film is amazing and Mr. Shumacher has been sorely overlooked for his attendance to detail, musicality and overall brilliance.If you are a Phantom fan....don't write this off because Michael and Sarah are missing.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2H289HC49DMIU	"A. Cropper ""vampirelissy14"""	I have been a fan of The Phantom of the Opera for fifteen years, both the book and the stage play. I have seen several movie versions but none of them compare to the beauty that is this movie. I have never seen anything quite so gorgeous before (and I'm not just talking about Gerard Butler, thought I'd gladly take him home with me).I had my reservations about the movie at first, like any phan who has grown up with the OLC album. I was a Crawford purist to tell the truth. But, as I saw more and more of what the movie looked like and heard the principal cast sing, my fears were quickly assuaged. Emmy Rossum is a wonderful Christine and Patrick Wilson has the perfect voice for Raoul.It seems to me that the person fans are most disappointed with is Gerard. Well...here's the thing. He is not Michael Crawford, and he doesn't try to be. He has a wonderful voice in my opinion that matches the Phantom's character just right. You have to remember that the Phantom is NOT a trained Opera singer. He has grown up under the opera house and can sing, but he is not supposed to be perfect. Gerard brought about the raw sensuality needed to correctly portray the Phantom, and I couldn't be happier with the final result. This movie is officially at the top of a very long list of favorites and will be there for a very long time, I'm sure. I can't wait for the dvd, and I'm positive I will see it in the theatre several times more.	5.0	Loved, loved, loved this film!	2005-01-03	0	0	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1VQBHHXIKHIGS	A Customer	The thing about a musical is that if you don't like the music, it really sucks. Fortunately, I knew I loved the theme because I copied it from Donald's iPod. It's just so haunting, isn't it? How about the movie? Let's watch.It's a Joel Schumacher film. Hey, didn't he kill the Batman franchise? I asked Google. Yep. That's because he was supposed to be making this movie, not those movies. It's just so atmospheric, and the acting is secondary to the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber and to the scenery. His style and this movie are a perfect fit.I do want to warn you that, if you go out and get this, the first music after the theme is supposed to be bad, so don't give up on me yet.We have a love triangle, petty intrigues, manipulative people, over-the-top humor, shades of AMADEUS, some chuckles at the lyrics when they get playful, spooky chilling stuff that literally gave me goosebumps. The original novel was obviously powerful, and nothing's been lost in translation here. Since about 90% of the dialogue is sung, it's a good thing I love the music. A love scene or two seems painfully long because it's sung, but that's okay. If I can be patient, so can you.As for the plot, everything you already know about it happens quickly, so it's no plot spoiler to say the hideous guy in the mask is in love with the lovely lady and does something about it. My life, actually. I'm pretty hideous, and Jan's a beauty. Except that in PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, I believe we all want ugly to win.And then the second of my two VCDs didn't work. Damn! I read the plot synopsis on Wikipedia after that. Schumaker wasn't 100% true to it, but I don't mind. I've got a feel for what it's about now, even though I'm sure I missed the best part. Now I can enjoy my MP3s even more. And if I stumble upon the DVD or VCDs in a store, I'll pick it up just to see how Schumacher's version ends. It's a rental I strongly recommend to you.	4.0	This is some powerful stuff	2008-01-01	1	0	1

This movie made a fairly low amount in theaters, so I have no clue how it has been #1 for so long, let alone at all.  Plus, it's beating out Seinfeld Season 4 for the #1 spot.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1CP8G4QZUK4HQ	"Adam ""Adam"""	First of all... I have to say that I was very surprised that The Phantom of the Opera is going to the movie theatres. Knowing that Mr. Weber is involved, I hoped for the best.I am a fan of the original cast and I knew that nobody was going to beat Sarah as Christine and Crawford as Phantom. But THIS is really, really bad.I can't believe that Weber allowed such a poor performance in a role of Christine and Phantom. The only good one was Carlotta and maybe Vicomt. With all respect to all actors... THIS IS A MUSICAL. Get a voice. Don't destroy one of the best musicals ever. Mr. Weber, wake up! Remove your earplugs and listen! Got it? Too late.Do not waste your money to go to see it. You might enjoy first 10 minutes... but after that, even visually, it gets very boring..Put some clothes on and go to see the musical. U can bet that any stage performance would not be worst than this. At least, u can be sure that u will see some acting and emotion in their voices when singing.I know that it must be hard to cast such a movie. People are spoiled with perfect voice of Brightman and Crawford. But when they decided to transform a musical into the movie, shouldn't they discussed money? I'm sure that with a little bit of makeup, they could have cast Sarah as a 20 years old. Or - at least use her voice and Crawford's as well.Maybe next time, they can do the same thing as Les Miserables in Concert, and bring it on the stage with its original cast and record it.It would be finally something worth to watch... But THIS move is really SAD. Sorry for my English, not a native speaker. ;o)	2.0	OH MY	2005-01-06	17	4	13
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A34UYJSA2TPLNT	"Adam Howell ""DarkwarlockZ"""	Visually, I was amazed at what they did with this film. I thought theatrically it was extremely well thought out and put together. It was truly an enjoyment to watch.Musically, I must admit, there was much left to be desired. I had to keep in mind throughout, that these were actors, and not necessarily accomplished musicians, and it well shows. There was not one role that was decently cast in the entirity of the production. Christine's vocals are sub-standard at best, and the Phantom had best stick to non musical roles. The only tolerable singer was Raoul, and marginally at that.	3.0	Could be better.	2007-01-19	2	0	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AO31JF8HT1ONU	"Adam J. Fernandes ""DarkWriter"""	"WARNING: SPOLIERS AHEADI have mixed feelings about this film. I saw The Phantom live in San Francisco when I was fourteen and it was truly a mind altering experience. Everything about the production was first rate, the costumes, the music, and the singing especially the Phantom, played by Davis Gaines, whose power lept off the stage.When I heard a movie was being made I was apprehensious to say the least. Seeing Joel Shumacher's name as the director was part of the reason for that. After seeing him butcher Batman, I was concerned that he would take too many liberties with this. Thankfully he did keep some things of the show, and enough of them to keep it going. Unfortunately, he didn't keep enough of them in.The Good:Emmy Rossum is luminescent as Christine. She plays the character as innocent and as naive, more so than the stage version. Her voice has the clear quality that it brings chills to the spine, it's the best in the film. Patrick Wilson stumbles a bit with the role. Never crossing over in Errol Flynn like heroism, but confident with his voice. My one requirement with the songs was that they not completely screw up ""All I Ask of You,"" which is my favorite song in the show, and their voices meld perfectly. The costume and production design elevate and go beyond the orginal show, giving it the sumptious quality it always deserved. The cinematography is excellent, no surprise since John Matheison is a genius at using existing light and shadows to further the effects of the already incredible sets. The music is so much more lush than the stage version, naturally. The added moment of the phantom's orgins was pretty cool as well.The Bad:Gerard Butler? Sorry buddy, you sound like an American Idol reject. You need someone in this roll that has power in his voice as well as a tortured sound, Gerard has none of that. As well as the fact that his face which, in the stage play, looked disfiguring and something that would explain his isolation, fear, and horror look know looks like a bad sunburn.The ""Masquerade section, although extremely well done as far as the costumes and sets for the extras go, falls apart when the Phantom appears. He is supposed to be The Mask of the Red Death from Edgar Allen Poe's legendary story and in the stage show, he's wearing a mask that like Lon Chaney's version, fills the onlookers with horror at seeing him. His mask is a full on skull, without a semblence of face behind it. In the film, it's a smaller mask, only covering up the eyes and the nose only. It's not scary or awe inspiring.The sword fight is unecessary. Everything before that is wonderful, it's just that the fight itself doesn't solve anything or lead anywhere. They could've gotten the same result in a more dramatic way and it doesn't fit with the Phantom's character. Throughout the film you see him in the shadows. He takes out people conspicuously and mysteriously to create an ambient level of fear, all the while maintaining a ghostly appearance. It has the feeling of they put it in because they could.The ""Point of No Return"" was where I screamed the loudest when I saw it. The dancers in the backround are an uneeded distraction, it's completely pointless for them to be there. Christine is gorgeous but the Phantom, wooing her in the stage production under a cloak and always too close for the guards to shoot her, know is behind a cowboy and indian mask and only touches her toward the end.The ending, with him leaving through the mirror, doesn't have the same shock as the original.All in all I was impresed with some, dissapointed with some obvious stuff, and grateful to see so much of it on screen.

Oh boy was this silly.  The only musical rendition of this that could not beat this stupid movie is the one showing in your nine year old's back yard.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A5ABW4JY88BL3	AJM	"Please don't read this if you are new to the story as this review contains spoilers. I've liked this musical since I heard the original casts' recording as a teenager. In college I finally had the opportunity to watch the musical in NY and put action and faces to the voices and music I had enjoyed for so long. Now, many years later, a movie version has come out. I did not know how I would respond to it, given that I liked the original version so much that any deviation would seem blasphemous! Well, I watched it and I DID like it! Here is what I did not like: The duel at the cemetery was strange and out of pace with the rest of the story. I agree with the reviewer who said that the Phantom would never have lost to young Raoul. It made him seem weak and less menacing. I'm pretending it never happened. And this is why I gave the movie 4 rather than 5 stars. Annoying also: some of the lines were spoken rather than sung. Anyone familiar with the original will be irked. Otherwise, it doesn't make a big difference.What I did like:* Emmy Rossum is lovely as the naive Christine. And she sings beautifully, too!* The movie explains a bit how the Phantom came to haunt the Opera in a way that isn't too intrusive or distracting.* The stage version always gave me the impression that the Phantom was obsessed with Christine and that she, once she figured out he was not a real angel, was truly afraid. In this version you have all that plus something else: an irresistible attraction between the Phantom and Christine. She is hopelessly drawn to him. Raoul's fear isn't just that she will be snatched by the Phantom, but that she'll willingly give in and go to him. They are, after all, kindred spirits in the sense that they love music, the theater, and share true talent. I liked that spin on the story.* The sets and costumes are opulent and lavish. Real eye candy.* Minnie Driver is a supremely funny Carlotta. She ad libs but it  is all consistent with her character.* I liked the flashforwards to the present time in the shades of gray (1920). The ""old"" characters got a good make up job- very believable.The ending was thoughtful, although not unexpected.It is hard to move away from the original casts' recording when listening to the songs in the movie, but it's just a question of getting used to new voices singing old favorites. Some of the actors' voices are better than others, but all in all the result is good, even if at moments you find yourself longing for a little occasional dubbing by the original cast...Now, totally irrelevant to the enjoyment of the film: did anyone else find the actor who played Raoul a dead ringer for Carson Kressley from Queer Eye? I found it distracting and half expected him to give the Phantom a make over... :-)"	4.0	A different spin on the musical (caution-spoilers)	2005-12-05	6	6	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A20T54OKL5VFSV	"Alastor ""Deviant Visionary"""	I have been a fan of the musical version of Phantom since my teens. It moves me... the story of unrequited love was one that always resonated deeply.The movie version of the musical moved me as well, there were many well done segments. The overall cinematography was also impressive (the black and white scenes were a nice touch).HOWEVER I have a couple of serious complaints about how the Phantom was represented. None of them have to do with Gerard Butler per se. I actually like him a lot as an actor, he was great in Attilla. My complaints instead have to do with the way the character was portrayed in the movie from a directorial angle.First off he is much too young and dashing. The Phantom is supposed to be someone who has nurtured Christine for a good portion of her life, and appeared as a surrogate father to her, who happens to fall in love with his student. Instead we get a swashbuckling romantic leading man type character who we have a hard time either identifying with or pitying. And pity is the one thing we must have for the Phantom in order for the character to truly work. The fact that he hides his face when first unmasked doesn't help this fact either (not to mention it makes the accompanying song make much less sense). Suffice to say it is hard to pity a man who is better looking than oneself, deformities aside.The other complaint I had was dealing with the mystical nature of the character. It seems that Joel Schumacher took pains to point out what the Phantom had up his sleeve for almost every disaster. He no longer shoots fire from his staff, he draws a sword. It is no longer a mystery how he makes Carlotta lose her voice, now it is simply a matter of him tainting her throat spray. All of this makes a more plausible story, but this story isn't SUPPOSED to be about plausibility, it is a  romantic and fantastic spectacle. Joel didn't seem to feel the need to make Batman and Robin plausible, why do so with the Phantom?This aside the movie could have been much worse, the supporting roles were all done very well, including Minnie, and the movie looked and sounded great.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1S26JXPQKFVPI	Alexander Arsov	"By far the greatest asset of this movie is the visual side. The costumes, the make-up and the sets are sumptuous historical affairs of rare beauty. The direction is flawless and captures to perfection both the lyrical and the sinister side of the story. The special effects, of course, are breathtaking: the transformation scene of the opera house, from old and dusty to new and glittering, is a visual tour de force. It's worth the price of admission alone.There is not a hint of anything stagey or static. The musical has been realized as a full-scale movie and has benefited from all advantages of modern cinema. It's a magnificent spectacle, a must for everybody who loves Andrew Lloyd Webber's original.The cast is problematic. The acting ranges from good to excellent, and some minor comic parts are wonderfully enlivened by Simon Callow and Mini Driver. But this is not an ordinary movie. It's a musical. And the music really does matter. This is where the problems start.Gerard Butler is the main vocal disappointment. He looks perfect for the part and his acting is more than competent. But the man simply doesn't have the voice. He has nothing to be ashamed of: Michael Crawford himself is not always convincing in the Original Broadway Cast recording. The Phantom is a monstrous part. It requires powerful voice and vast range of expression (from tender lyricism to sheer madness). Gerry Butler does the only possible thing: he exaggerates the recitatives and disrupts the melodic lines in a futile attempt to compensate for his vocal inadequacy. As a result, in the lyrical moments he sounds bland, in the dramatic ones he is almost comic.Emmy Rossum has a voice almost as sweet as her face. Unfortunately it's thin, weak and, in the more dramatic moments, strained. When the Phantom demands ""Sing for me!"" she is quite incapable of rising to the occasion. She conveys the charm and innocence of Christine with rare skill. But when it comes to vocal acting, her performance leaves a good deal to be desired.Patrick Wilson seems to be the best among the principals. But that may well be because his part is far less prominent. The rest of the cast, as I have already said, is excellent.The music itself might have been recorded more spectacularly. That would at any rate have benefited the visual splendor and the dark gothic atmosphere, both completely and rightly over-the-top. But the 5.1 sound will knock your socks off anyway.All in all, despite the persistently lackluster vocal performance, the movie is an unforgettable experience. The fairy-tale story, though a trifle inane, contains more than enough serious overtones to make it still relevant. ALW's music is timeless. One thing is sure: having seen this movie, you'll never again listen to the OBC recording (or any other) with the same visual images in your mind. Better singing you may be able find at many other audio or video recordings, although the perfect Phantom has not been recorded yet, and probably it never will be. But for sheer visual glamour, intensity and power, Joel Schumacher's epic can hardly be bettered, let alone surpassed."	4.0	Visually magnificent but vocally mediocre	2012-10-22	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ACTPCV7BMYO8L	Alex	I first saw this musical in London, it was second greatest musical I ever saw live, next to Les Miz, which I saw a few days later. With my aunt crying her eyes out, and me just being awstruck at this Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. Then I took my girlfriend to see this, dispite the mixed reviews it was getting. In this case the critics didn't know what they were talking about. The people who hated this movie are people who either A) Hate the musical. B) Hate Andrew Lloyd Webber. And C) Hate musicals all together. Some who were huge Phantom fans were upset that Micheal Crawford would play not play the Phantom, the fact is the Crawford is in his mid 60's and is just to old. Gerrard Butler was good as the Phantom, his voice was very different than what I'm used too, but I got used to it mid way through the film. Emmy Rossum, who played Christiane is really good, but not as good as Sarah Brightman. The film was not as good as the play as most plays to musicals are. But this Phantom is a sight to see and movie that must be seen.	5.0	Not as Good As the Play, but still amazing	2005-01-21	4	3	1

The sets, the singing, the choreography... it is really truly striking in a way that the stage play can never be (not that plays can't be wonderful, but they have their limitations).Emmy Rossum has a wonderful voice and a very youthful, innocent look that I feel fit the role well. I thought Patrick Wilson was appropriately debonair and handsome, and he also had a nice voice. Gerard Butler's voice could have been stronger, but it was by no means awful. As others have pointed out, though, he was a tad too handsome for this role. At one point during the movie, I whispered to my friend, ""Isn't he too hot to be the Phantom?""I really enjoyed the expanded backstory on the Phantom -- I felt the movie made him more sympathetic and less one-dimensional than the play did.Overall, I was delighted by the movie in a way I never was by the play.

Sure, it does take away some of the dramatics of the stage... but I enjoyed it for what it was.Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford would have been great, but I like Emmy and Gerard too. Original London Cast or the film cast, I like both of them.Emmy Rossum is quite an actress and singer! She isn't as operatic as Sarah Brightman, but what a voice! So strong, clear, and crystalline, and an impressive range! And at her age? This young lady is going to go quite a distance! I'm impressed that she'd never seen the play before and that she's nailed this role dead-on.Gerard Butler...! He just stole the show for me! His dusky singing voice is actually quite lovely concidering that he's not this highly-trained vocal acrobat. Michael Crawford has a lovely tenor, but it seems lightweight, and not rich and full enough to pull off Erik's role, in my opinion.Gerard actually hits those high notes quite well. He's able to go into the tenor range for more intimate, romantic moments, and into the baritone for the highly dramatic ones. He has gotten some criticism for being too young and handsome (and cute) for Erik, but I don't care about that. He has Erik's strong, mysterious, tempramental, and *very* sensual nature! And he's totally sympathetic and poignant as Erik, especially after ""All I Ask of You"" and at the grand finale. I just wanted to hold him at such moments. Obvious stalking put aside, I just can't see why Christine chose Raoul over Erik.Patrick Wilson's Raoul is handsome and has a lovely voice, and he has more backbone than in the play... but I still don't care for Raoul, mainly that he took Christine away from Erik when he could have gotten any mademoiselle.Minnie Driver is a wonderfully obnoxious but funny Carlotta! Margaret Preese(I think that's her name) did a wonderful job lending her singing to Minnie's Calotta. Minnie's actual singing voice in ""Learn To Be Lonely"" is very unique. Beautiful and really haunting.Miranda Richardson was wonderful as the brooding Madame Giry. Dramatic and intense from her appearance to her voice.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2FGN3AEI7FK0I	"Allstrangeaway ""allstrangeaway"""	A horrible disaster on almost all counts.  As it is easier to list the positive points I will concentrate on those first.  Emily Rossum does an admirable job singing and Miranda Richardson does a very good job of adding quite a bit more color to the otherwise limited role of Mme Giry (She also notably maintains a French accent throughout - not something that most U.S. actors are capable of).However, such bright points in the film are few and far between.  The direction is muddled between maintaining a respect for the stage musical source material and creating a perfume commercial background for Emily Rossum to sing in.  The art design is colorful and spectacular yet confused and deeply anachronistic.  The masquerade scene was completely butchered by the monochromatic costume design and anachronistic choreography.However, most dissapointing was the portrayal of the phantom.  The role was inextricably miscast.  The unfortunate thing about this is that much of this musical relies HEAVILY on the actors within it.  It is not a strong enough vehicle on its own to suffer such a crucial mistep in performance (particularly the lack of a strong, or emotionally persuasive singing voice).  Furthermore, and perhaps because the story is by now so well known, the Phantom [Gerald Butler] is given a much more central role.  This may have worked better if the actor were more captivating, but it will take more than an unbuttoned shirt to convince me that there is anything emotionally tortured or mysterious about this individual.In short this is the product of a most unfortunate misadventure in filmaking.  The most crushing dissapointment being the almost certain lack of a remake in the very near future, as this is a sorely inadequate representation of the stage musical or even of Gaston Leroux's story.	1.0	Miserable	2005-03-03	36	9	27

Beautifully orchestrated, acted and performed, this movie version does the theatrical masterpiece proud.Gerard Butler is so handsome and yet so intense in his portrayal of the tormented Phantom that if I were Christine (the excellent Emmy Rossum), that Raoul guy (vocally gifted Patrick Wilson) would have had to drag me out of that underground boudoir with wild horses and a bulldozer.Wilson seemed like a teenager in love compared to the agonized yearning of the Phantom, and in a different musical he would have been hopping around a gazebo in the rain singing ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"".Minnie Driver does a fine comedy turn as Prima Donna Carlotta, and although she doesn't actually sing in the movie, she does a credit worthy number during the credits.  Miranda Richardson is perfectly cast as Madame Giry, longtime keeper of the Phantom's secret.  Rossum is also a casting coup, and the doe-eyed Jennifer Beal look-a-like fully captures the essence of Christine, the Phantom perpetual flava-of-the-month.The movie had me spellbound from Act one, Scene one until the closing credits, and I highly recommend it to you.Amanda Richards, September 12, 2005"	5.0	Had me humming all day!	2005-09-12	27	25	2

Only a truly hard heart would not find pity inside for Erik, and for Christine. If only pain had not maddened him, Raoul would never have had a chance to love her; but don't take me wrong, often times Raoul is portrayed as a wimp, a second choice.

Masion ""history lover and realist"""	"I just got through viewing this DVD for the third time and I have to say I think it is one of the best depictions (of a stage musical to film) I've ever seen.A lot of negative critique relayed towards ""Phantom"" seems to be related to the fact that ""it isn't true to the stage musical.  Gerard Butler doesn't really sound like Michael Crawford, la la la...""Ummm...I'm going to take a guess that these critics did not read the casting before they saw it and were thus disappointed?""Phantom"" is not meant to be an absolute re-creation of Crawford and Brightman's brilliant stage performances.  Anybody who went into the theatre expecting that was BOUND to be disappointed.But there are some great perks to the film.  The introduction, where the raising of the chandelier corresponds with special effects to recreate the Opera Populaire in its heyday gave me goosebumps.Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum have incredible chemistry.  In fact, my biggest problem was ""accepting"" the fact that Phantom is supposed to be a hideous deformed pyshopath (Butler is sinfully handsome, and no suspension of disbelief can change the fact.) Theirs is a more romantic and erotic depiction of the love triangle.Butler's voice is rich and sensual, more geared towards a rock sound than Crawford's portrayal.  This makes it DIFFERENT, not necessarily BAD.  Rossum is a joy to hear.It was also refreshing to see Raul involved in some action scenes instead of his portrayal in the musical of a trust fund baby waiting for the opera star to hand herself to him on a plate.I've seen the stage version twice, and was very pleased with the film.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A22ZF72VP5R6D5	"Amazon Customer ""Creature of the Night"""	I have to agree with 99.9% of the reviews I have read on here.  I have seen the movie 4 times now (and plan on more if they don't take it from the theatres here any time soon).  The first time I saw it was around Christmas and I took my 19 year old son.  He was surprised to have enjoyed it so much and I had to buy two copies of the deluxe cd version so I could send him one *grin*.  Now he listens to it as much as he can.  I also listen to it often and feel myself swept away into a different world, remembering what was going on on the screen as I listen to each song.I rarely go to the movies because of the cost.  I figure if I want to see a movie I'll wait till it comes out on dvd and either rent or buy.  But with Phantom, I have to keep going back, no matter how much the tickets cost.  The movie brings out just about every emotion humans go through.I have read much criticism about Butler's Phantom, but I think these people have gone into this closed minded.  I have not seen others in the role (though I've heard some of Michael Crawford's singing), but I believe Butler's rendition of the Phantom was amazing.  The pain, the anger, the passion, the love, to name but a few emotions.  I could see all of that in his eyes, in the way he moved, in the sound of his voice.  I, like many, fell in love with Phantom.  Even with his dark side, even with him being a killer.I can't believe how badly the critics treated this movie, or the award ceremonies.  One sometimes (maybe most of the time) has to wonder if some of these people actually watch these things with an open mind.  But, I have learned from past experience, to never let what a critic says be the deciding factor on if I see something.I just know that I will be owning this DVD and will probably wear it out.  I may never see the stage play (doesn't come to my little city) and I'm not interested in other film versions that appear to make the Phantom more of a horror story, but with only this movie I have become a big Phantom fan.  I will buy any DVD version they put out, expecting anniversary editions and who knows what else down the road.It will not be the same as seeing it in the movie, unless you have a big screen tv with surround sound, but get the DVD so you can always give in to your desire and passion for Music of the Night.  And if you haven't seen it in the theatre, do so now if it's still playing where you are, you won't be disappointed.	5.0	hear it, feel it, secretly possess you	2005-02-21	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3O2Q0LKKL2RIJ	Amazon Customer	"First things first, mostly cause it annoys me when people say this, the Phantom of the Opera is a MUSICAL people, not an opera.  I will say it again: it is a musical about a phantom who ""haunts"" an opera house, it is not an opera.  That said...This movie was a solid three.  It wasn't terrible but it wasn't that great.  The sets are beautiful, the costumes fabulous, but the casting was bad and the lip-syncing very bad.  Gerard Butler, an actor I usually love to watch, was a horrible Phantom.  I give him a lot of credit for singing the part himself, but he fell short.  Big time.  There were times when his accent slipped through (normally I love his accent, but not as the Phantom), he screamed a lot of his notes, didn't support his voice and sounded almost breathy at times.  As for Emmy Rossum, she sounds like a child, but considering she was 16 when this was made, it doesn't truly surprise me.  I don't have a problem with Patrick Wilson other than I just don't like his voice.  The only saving grace casting wise is Minnie Driver who is the best character in the entire movie and makes it worth watching.  That said, I love the music in the movie, in spite of the singers, and watch it mostly to listen to it.  At least I did until I bought the soundtrack.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2F4O32Y1HAYJQ	Amazon Customer	I am very pleased with this Blue Ray version of Phantom of the Opera. I purchased the regular DVD some years ago and was somewhat disappointed with the sound of the voices. One of my continuing criticisms of this movie is that the quality of the voices was not nearly as good as the actual live performances. However, in this Blue Ray version, there is a vast improvement in the sound and is much more pleasant to listen to. To be sure, nothing can beat the original cast recording with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman though.	5.0	Best Quality	2011-09-21	0	0	0

This is one that could be watched over and over again without being boring.  I especially love it due to the dark nature of the film and how it presents a message of overcoming that darkness with kindness and beauty.  I would not recommend younger children seeing it but the rating of PG-13 suffices in that I believe a thirteen year old could handle it.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1SBG8TCI8JAS8	Amazon Customer	I have been lucky enough to see the original stage version as well as two more stage productions with different casts, so when I say this movie and this cast is the best, I have something to compare it to.  First, Gerard Butler--yum!  I loved Michael Crawford's phantom, but Gerard brings a sensuality and emotional depth to the role I have not seen before.  I would also say that I enjoyed his singing voice better than any I have heard before because he placed such EMOTION into each song.  He made us FEEL his rage, despair, love and desperation as if they were our own.  Emmy Rossum was perfect as Christine.  She has a beautiful voice that I felt was a perfect compliment for Gerard Butler's.  The entire cast  was supberb in my opinion (foremost was Minnie Driver's hysterical portrayal of the diva of the opera house).  Also, the costumes and scenery made the movie eye candy to look at.  Lastly, have a glass of ice water handy for the Phantom and Christine's sizzling rendition of Point of No Return near the end of the film.  Like a previous reviewer, I, too, would have chosen the Phantom over Raoul any day!  This one is a must have for any musical fan.  Pop it in the DVD player and get ready for a thoroughly enjoyable two hours!	5.0	PhanTASTIC!!	2006-01-08	2	0	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A15944LOA130VK	Amazon Customer	"Having now watched the film a number of times and having read numerous and varied reviews, I have a few things that I would like to say.First, I thought the film was beautiful. While I have been known to be a Broadway ""snob"", this film won me over with its visual expression, endearing acting, and frankly fabulous vocals.Second, to those of you who did not enjoy the film, you have the right to that opinion. However, please do the rest of the world a favor and express that opinion in such a way that we can understand it. To be specific, please learn to spell and to write in complete sentences so that we can understand what you are trying to say. You obviously feel strongly or you wouldn't be writing a review. Your voice deserves to be heard - which won't happen if we can't understand your review.Thirdly, to those of you who dismiss the film out of hand simply because it is not the Michael Crawford/Sarah Brightman stage show that you are so obsessed with, I'm frankly sorry for you. This movie ISN'T the stage musical. It doesn't claim to be. In fact, the filmmakers made a point of changing a number of elements so as to distinguish the movie completely from the stage musical. Perhaps you could try appreciating it for itself and not as an imitation of your beloved musical. You might be surprised at how much you enjoy the movie once you look at it as a separate entity.Finally, I would like to reiterate that I found this movie to be a lovely, well-told story. Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, and Patrick Wilson brought fresh life to characters that have long been staples of the musical world. The supporting cast was strong, and the set design and cinematography were incredible. All in all, a stellar production."	5.0	Don't jump to conclusions!	2005-07-14	12	11	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2ECVRUX2BPYE6	Amazon Customer	This movie had a lot of potential.  I did not even mind the changes in the movie from the stage production.  BUT, any one with any singing experience knows that it is IMPOSSIBLE to sings these songs without opening your mouth!  The leads are all running around singing intense songs with their mouths open a crack.  I could not enjoy this movie at all because I knew they were lip syncing.  If something like this bothers you, I would avoid this movie.  The acting definitely falls flat.	2.0	Major Problem	2007-04-20	11	1	10
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2LNS3YZNKWU7F	Amazon Customer	Excellent!!  The movie is much better than the Broadway production - better character development, better acting, better singing.  Madame Giry is a much more intriguing character in the film.  Christine's attraction to the Phantom is more understandable and believable. Plus, we get to see the Phantom's past and why he is the way he is.In response to the comment about the sword fight:  The Phantom would know very little about fencing because he's lived alone beneath an opera house all his life.  You must practice fencing to become good at it.All of my family members (ages from 10 to 47) highly recommend the film version of The Phantom of the Opera.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AAAK2MKIA508J	Amazon Customer	I have seen the Phantom of the Opera film more than once and enjoyed it each time. It is exquisite, moving, and never ceases to give me the shivers.The music is of unparalled beauty and I think, wholeheartedly, that Miss Rossum, Mr. Butler, and the rest of the cast did a fabulous job.I have never seen the PTO play, but have heard so much about it from people that have, that I might as well have. I have heard the Sarah Brightman/Michael Crawford PTO music countless times and I simply love it.I own and have read the novel by Gaston Leroux several times. I favor the book over both the movie and the play and found the Phantom a tad bit...wimpy in the movie, but also see that he is portrayed more as a tragic lover than a more-than-slightly-insane genius with a taste for torture and a fettish for sleeping in coffins, but I love it nonetheless.I believe that the new movie, the play, and the novel are the same in many ways, but in some respects completely different and can hardly be compared against one another. I am madly in love with all three stories and greatly encourage the enjoyment of each. Even if you have misgivings, I highly suggest that you at least view the new movie with an open mind.	5.0	Truly fantastic	2005-03-25	3	2	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A132P2I41V7G79	Amazon Customer	"I was so excited when I hear that ""Phantom of the Opera"" was being released as a movie.  I have never seen the stage production but have been listening to the music for years.  I found the movie to be very beautiful and beautifully made but I cringed every time there was a close up on the actors singing.  The dubbing was HORRIBLY innacurate.  It looked like a bad lip-sync.  I do not know whether or not the actors actually sang their own music or if it was done by other people.  The characters' faces were expressionless and dispassionate while they were singing, and they looked like they were uninvolved emotionally with what was happening to them.  They ought to have looked frightened, in love, or at least concerned with their situations.  I almost gave this movie 5 stars, but had to back down to 4 stars.  I'm definitely buying this the day it comes out on DVD, but may watch it with one eye closed."	4.0	I absolutely LOVED this movie but...	2005-03-24	3	2	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A4PNHQAGF3QOJ	Amazon Customer	"The classic love triangle: woman torn between two men.  Will she choose normalcy and safety or danger and the exotic?  Classic themes: love, obsession, and sacrifice.The actors did fantastic jobs.  Emmy Rossum as Christine conveys fear, fascination, love, and pity with subtle expressions--just how her eyes change; she does not overact.  Gerard Butler as the Phantom projects love, obsession, rage, pain, and Machiavellian intent with his eyes and voice.  Patrick Wilson does a great job of being the normal, handsome hero figure. All of the other actors were exceptional.Even if the leads' voices don't match the technical quality of the original stage performers, they are better actors which justifies why they were cast in their parts.  Since the silver screen shows minute detail, their acting abilities shine. Watching PONR, you can see the fear and fascination Christine has for the Phantom, and you can see the love and obsession that the Phantom has for Christine, not just through their faces/gestures, but through their singing.This is a gut-wrenching tale.  You would have to be made of stone to be unaffected by this movie; how could you not feel sympathy for the Phantom?Sure, as a Phantom fan, I question some directorial decisions, but regardless, this is a fabulous, high quality movie that deserves appreciation and not the snobbish disdain it received from so many ""professional"" critics who seemed to have axes to grind agains ALW or JS.Go out and buy this movie!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2MZ4CSOYUNXFK	Amazon Customer	"To start off, The sound track and the stage show is some of the best written in this era. I sing the songs, I dance the dances! What a great story!That being said, here's my view of the movie.The opening I found to be quite exciting; the transformation of the theatre from old to new was a breathtaking sequence. I loved the irony of the present being black and white and the past being color.Then, the story began to slow down a bit...no not a bit. It slammed the breaks and sent the audience flying through the windshield. What worked so well for the stage show just didn't seem right for film; and even those who often complain about being 'true to the source', some things just don't translate very well from one medium to another. A few songs should have been cut or shortened, so the pace wouldn't be so slow.For example, ""Wishing you were somehow here again"" is a great song, but it we were watching too much of Christine just wandering through the cemetary.Also, the song ""Phantom of the Opera"" was too fast paced for what was being shown on screen. (Christine and the Phantom floating in the boat). The sound and the picture didn't fit each other.Thankfully, the story picked up speed toward the end, and finished off nicely. The last scene was a nice touch.Final rating: 6/10Had the movie been about 30-40 minutes shorter, it might have been Oscar material; But the film is definitely worth checking out one night, when you're bored."	3.0	"""Help me make the music of the night!"""	2005-04-20	7	3	4
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A224WP98KNRTAD	Amazon Customer	"I went into this movie really wanting to like it.  I saw the play in Toronto when I was 15 (12 years ago) and I really loved it.  It was the first big play I had ever been to, and I was obsessed with the soundtrack for a year.  I haven't seen the play again since so I would hardly consider myself a ""phanatic,"" though I have always enjoyed the music (I have the Canadian cast recording with Colm Wilkinson) and wouldn't mind catching it again.  When I heard about the movie coming out, I was thrilled.  However, upon seeing it (we finished watching it about an hour ago), I have to say I was very disappointed with the results.I thought the acting was fine and even though I don't think Gerry Butler was a phenomenal singer, I liked his passion and craziness.  I always cry at the end (I used to never listen to the final few songs on the soundtrack or else I would break down!) and I felt the tragedy of his character was worth the cry.  I've never really liked the character of Raoul (?) but I thought the actor who played him did a fine job.  Emmy Rossum was great--I won't pretend to know a lot about classical or opera singing, but I think she sounded wonderful.  I didn't realize how young she was, either--what an achievement!My biggest complaints are with the production.  After watching the first 15 minutes, I turned to my husband and said, ""this is kinda terrible, isn't it?""  I mean, the camera work was extremely boring and made it seem like it was a low budget TV movie.  The whole thing just seemed awkward and contrived.  It was like they simply canned the play and put it on a movie set.  There was no innovation, no creativity put into it whatsover.  Since when can you take a play, a musical especially, and just make it into a movie?  They are two completely different experiences so I would expect there would be some tweaking to make it enjoyable in the other medium.  I'm sure there are many people who are happy because of the music and the beautiful sets, but there still needs to be a fulfilling plot!  And more than just a rehash of the play!  There needs to be feeling, and this just left me cold.  I could've taken or left it after watching it for 20 minutes.  I just didn't get excited about it, it seemed so hollow, and I'm not usually a movie snob or anything.  Like I said, I cried at the end, but I always do (even when just listening to the old soundtrack) and I'm always a sucker for the misunderstood guy.  I guess I just expected more from this big Hollywood production that has been in the works for years."	2.0	Kinda blah	2005-07-26	12	4	8

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2ECY4R6UANCX4	Amazon Customer	"I'll admit, I was worried.  I have been a ""phan"" for almost 20 years now, ever since I read the book in second grade.  I have been fortunate enough to see Phantom performed live on stage and I have owned and adored the original London cast recording and hightlights from the play for several years now.  I would never deny credit to Michael Crawford or Sarah Brightman.  But this movie exceeded my expectations.  In fact, it blew away any previous version I've heard or seen.  I was stunned.The movie pays homage to the play and is almost too faithful in this stage-to-screen adaptation.  Almost.  It retains all of the beloved elements of the theatre including the mist and rising candles, the chandelier and the like, and then improves upon it by fully utilizing its new medium of film.The chemistry on-screen is electrifying, and culminates with the passionate performances in The Point of No Return.  Emmy Rossum is stunning, both visually and vocally, and Patrick Wilson's voice is pure and perfectly pitched-ideal for the role.But where the filmmakers really excelled was in their casting of Gerard Butler as the phantom.  Not only did he understand the appeal of the story and of the phantom itself, he truly threw himself into the role and captured the very soul of the phantom.  Although he only speaks eight lines of the movie (the rest being sung), it was easy to be so drawn in to the movie to even forget that it was a musical.  Gerard performed the role with a passion, intensity and reverence for the character that is not to be missed.  He has the right ""edge"" for the part and his performances are impassioned, sincere and heartbreaking.In fact, the cast is so enthralling that I found I had to buy the soundtrack just to keep myself from watching the movie!Andrew Lloyd Webber himself said this of the movie:""The film looks and sound fabulous...it's an extraordinarily fine document of the show.  Of course, it's a difference animal to the stage show...but it doesn't threaten the integrity of the show in any way.  ...if anything it's expanded it and given it perhaps and even deeper emotional centre.""Be open-minded and watch it already!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1KK5HIQKXK2B3	Amazon Customer	I knew some of the music and the history (ALW stole practically everything from various Puccini operas) when I went to see this movie. Schumacker said that he did not want to focus on the glamour and the grandiose and instead make sure to capture the love story. He failed miserably. The movie is nothing but glitz and bad music.First of all, the love story is conspicuously absent from the musical... it does not happen at any point that I noticed, though it is often spoken of. The images in this movie adaptation were certainly stunning, but made little dramatic sense. The music in no way enhanced the plot or characters. It looked like Sir Andrew and Schumacker just wanted to show off how much money they have.It was a truly awful movie adaptation of a truly awful musical. If you want the romance of the Phantom story, go for Maury Yeston's version. That one has its heart where it belongs, not in its wallet.	1.0	What could I expect?	2005-05-11	28	9	19

If you haven't, then the film is basically the same thing, scene for scene. The only thing that the film does better than the stage production is the advantage of different sets and locations, whereas the stage is limited to...well...the stage. The music is good, though I think the Phantom casting was a little iffy. Gerard Buter (""Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life"") plays the Phantom and it seems in some areas that he's straining to get to the right notes in the songs. It's especially noticeable in 'Music of the Night,' which is basically the biggest solo song for the Phantom. Emmy Rossum does a great job as Christine and doesn't miss a beat in the music. All the songs are good and the sets, costumes and story is solid.

I love musicals and this is one of the best.  I have watched it six times already and I am sure I will be watching it again.  In fact I like it so much that I have the CD version of the entire movie so that I can listen to it without having to watch it.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1OTGBG66P6K5Y	"Amazon Customer ""MRD"""	Like most Phantom aficionados, I anxiously awaited the release of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA as a cinema release.  I anticipated sumptuous staging, terrific acting and, of course, musical performance at the highest levels.I got two out of the three.  PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is magnificently staged.  The stepping from black and white to color to indicate jumping back and forth in chronological time is superb.  When the theater, long forgotten and in decay, is suddenly transformed back in time to its former grandeur the effect is absolutely magical. Indeed, PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, from the standpoint of cinematography, is a feast for the eyes.I was equally impressed with the acting abilities of the major characters.  Each brings to the screen the necessary abilities to pull in the viewer with total believability.Andrew Lloyd Webber's score, turning to the foundation of the movie's music, is incomparable!  Truly a modern musical genius, Webber's tone poetry is movingly beautiful.  Which brings me to the vocal performances. Without mincing words, the vocal performance, especially when considering the stage work of Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, was absolutely appalling!  I could hardly believe it.  How did the composer allow such mediocrity? I suppose that he may have wanted to preserve the sanctity of the stage original but even then I was perplexed. While Ms. Rossum (Christine) was moderately fine (though not coming remotely close to Brightman's defining performance in the role) Gerard Butler (The Phantom) was awful.  Yes, he brought considerable feeling to the tortured character of the Phantom but, then, I have already praised the acting in this film. Ironically, the only person with a real voice in the cast, Minnie Driver, was not allowed to sing, having her voiced dubbed.So there it is. Three stars for the staging, acting and cinematography.  I just cannot get past the terrible vocal performances.  If you have never heard the original stage soundtrack or seen the piece on stage you may be fine.  Otherwise, be prepared for a feast for the eyes but not the ears.THE HORSEMAN	3.0	YES AND NO	2005-05-18	11	2	9

I was reluctant to see it because more then half of the reviews were very negative.At the end of it, we both agreed that the play is probably a lot better.The positive things about this movie:1. The costumes and sets were spectacular. If not for the gorgeous imagery I probably would have walked out of the theater.2. The music, particularly the love ballads, were very stirring.3. The story itself is great.The negative:1. Some of the opera singing was very irritating and gave me a headache.2. I was very distracted the entire time, because all I could think was, ""my god, this is cheezy."" Overall, the movie did not work AS a movie. it was very awkward when they would start singing at the most random parts and I felt the urge to laugh at the corniness of it and roll my eyes.In conclusion, you should see it because it is an experience.

I didn't even know who Gerard Butler was until this movie.  His phantom was more convincing than any other I have heard and seen; so emotional, mysterious, and definately sexy.  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. He frightened me, yet he intrigues me, I felt for him.  The plays I have seen are now using a deeper voiced phantom versus Michael Crawford higher and less emotional sounding voice.  I have always enjoyed this as a play, but I'm so in love with this movie.  Emmy Rossum was also a more convincing Christine, with her more youthful, yet mature, and perfectly pitched voice, and her angelic looks.  Patrick Wilson was a surprisingly good Raoul.  I almost felt sorry for him when he watches how Christine reacts when she is with the phantom.  You will laugh and you will cry.

It's hard to capture the power of the state and the music in a movie but I really felt like this is a close second to seeing the Broadway performance. The angst and confusion of Cristine is very well played out. I don't think this story ever gets old.

She herself falls in love with a childhood friend, Raoul, while at the same time becomes entranced with the phantom.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AIB8E8TM2MVJ7	Amlaphq	This is a fantastic movie! For those of us pitiful souls who yearn to see the Broadway stage, movies such as this can still capture our romantic spirits and give us a taste of the greatness of musicals of the stage. While some reviews claim that it is not true to the stage rendition in it's entirety, I still feel that it does a spectacular job in presenting the magic of sound and song! (I listen to the original sound track as I type and reflect the similarities/differences)I agree with one reviewer who said that the Phantom is a younger, sexier version of the deformed Phantom. It adds to the romantic appeal and desire, and heightens the pity of someone who yearns for what he cannot have. Instead of being repulsed by the external entirely, the focus is on the impurity of the soul as Christine puts it - the developed hatred and anger at the world. The attraction and seduction is also easier to believe for me. The scene in the Phantom's layer - the sexual tension! Captivating.Overall, I am entirely enthralled with this movie and watching it only makes me long to see it on stage more! In the meantime, I continue to listen to my soundtracks and watch this movie over and over again!	5.0	MESMERIZING!	2008-09-13	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AY4R8JIZO1LBH	A music fan	When this movie came out in the theater back in 2004, I thought it was actually pretty good.  However, as the years have passed and I have watched the DVD multiple times, I realize that I was wrong.  It has not withstood the test of time and the more I watch it, the more disappointed I become.  The movie lacks the most important aspect of any motion picture: emotion.  With perhaps the exception of Gerard Butler as the Phantom, most of the actors turn in a cookie-cutter, ho-hum performance that fails to meet what should be the  high expectations for this musical.Emmy Rossum has a beautiful voice as Christine.  However, she could not deliver a good performance overall.  In the scenes that required her to show some sense of emotion, all she can do is stare wide-eyed at everything, like a deer in the headlights.  She did that so much I wondered if her eyes are permanently stuck that way.  And then there's Patrick Wilson as Raoul.  Initially, it seemed like a good casting choice because he had Broadway experience.  But watching him play Raoul was like watching Keanu Reeves play Raoul.  Again, absolutely no emotion to speak of.  Also, what really got me was the age difference between Rossum and Wilson.  Christine and Raoul were supposed to be childhood sweethearts, according to the story.  But Wilson is at least 10 years older than Rossum if he's a day.  So are we to believe that when he was 17, he was in love with a 7 year old? (shudder.)Gerard Butler gave the only memorable performance.  He had all the Phantom moves down, including the swishing of his cape, and did pretty well vocally.  But the make-up job on him was horrendous.  The Phantom is supposed to be hideous and ugly.  When his mask is pulled off, it looked like he just had a few burns here and there.  I was hardly repulsed.  That's not Butler's fault, however.Anyway, if you want to see how it's really done, I strongly recommend getting the recently released 25th anniversary performance of Phantom.  There you will find everything that is sorely missing from this film.	3.0	Soulless and void of emotion	2012-05-28	1	0	1

The major problem is the Phantom,it completly misses the the point, the musical is named 'the phantom of the Opera' so why did ever cast an actor to play the role and not a singer. Don't get me wrong I like Butler, Ive seen some of his movies and he acts well, but he can't sing. the Phantom is a very challenging part and his voice was not up to it. we are supposed to fall in love with the voice of the phantom, because thats how he shows us his amazing soul. Butler is adequate as a singer, but (like most people) completley inadequate singing opera type songs.The other two singers who played Raoul and Christine could have been stronger too. there chemistry was good but the singing could have been better. You would have thought that after all the musical being on the west end all this time they could have found more suitable lead roles.	3.0	good but not perfect	2012-03-04	4	1	3

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ABLJ2984Y13BR	Andrea Crompton	"If you are thinking of purchasing this DVD you are in for a spectacular treat! I still cannot fathom why this magnificent rendition of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" was judged so harshly by the critics.I know many have been comparing Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler to Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford. Even if you are familiar with the original cast recording, please give this movie and soundtrack a chance. It is true that the interpretations and voice quality are somewhat different. But I believe that many things are improved in this version.Emmy Rossum's voice brought such youth and innocence to the character of Christine. She is more pleasing to listen to, in my opinion, than Sarah Brightman as her sound is very pure and unobscured by a heavy vibrato.Gerard Butler has, unfortunately, been under much criticism for his performance as the Phantom. Personally, I think his interpration is much more appropriate. It is true that Michael Crawford has an incredibly trained voice and sings flawlessly. However, I have always imagined the Phantom to have a darker more mysterious edge to his voice. This is exactly what Gerard brings to the character of the Phantom. His passion and emotion can be heard behind each syllable. Music is also my passion, and though many musicians have attacked his singing ability, I commend him, and the others as well for their contribution to the world of music in making this film. Gerard's acting is genious as well. His character draws you to a degree not accomplished by many actors. Bravo!I also highly reccommend the extended edition soundtrack as well. I am listening to it even I as I type this review. Both the movie and soundtrack would earn 10 stars from me if I could give them.Each time I view this masterpiece I am brought to tears. The music and acting evokes emotions from me like no other film has. I trust the characters will win your heart as they have won mine."	5.0	Phantastic!	2005-07-07	9	6	3
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A27R0I2O0F3JC0	Andrea	"It seems that there are many that did not like Gerard Butler as the Phantom.  I am not one of them.  I would have had a difficult time picking Raoul over the Phantom.  I was shocked to find out that he has not had a lot of formal voice training because he was just that good.  He made me ""feel it"".  I saw the stage show in Florida and it was not the infamous Michael Crawford.  Still, I found the play to be confusing and disappointing that the Phantom was not present more.  That's what I went to the show to see.  The movie did not let me down in this way. The gaps were filled to explain how the ""phantom"" came to exist in the solitary loneliness of the opera house and we saw how he became the musically talented and obssessive man.  Emmy Rossum has an extraoridinary voice and an innocent beauty, but it was the Phantom that brought the sensuality to each performance. Gerard Butler may not be an opera singer, but his voice was very passionate and I was captivated.  I rented this video and watched it 4 times in a week.  I just purchased the 2-disc special edition and look forward to watching it now.I recommend this movie to those that enjoy musicals, appreciate beauty and intense emotions portrayed through song.  I agree that the opening sequence of the chandelier is breath-taking in itself.  The whole cast has talent, but it was the Phantom that became my ""Angel"".  What woman doesn't want to be adored and desired exclusively to the point of obssession?  O.K.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	I am a gigantic fan of the stage play `The Phantom of the Opera'.  I've seen it ten times and I'm actually planning on seeing it again in March.  I've seen it in Boston twice and once in New York.  I've seen nearly every adaptation of it.  I mean, I LOVE this story!  A few months ago I wrote a review for the 1925 film adaptation, which in my opinion is the best film adaptation of this story.  In that review I mentioned that I was a fan of this 04 version.  Truth of the matter is that I saw this twice in the theaters and I do own it, but as I've pondered this film (and recently rewatched it) I've come to realize that I'm not as much a fan as I thought.Here is why.As I thought about this version two things really stuck out for me.  Visually it was sublime.  I remember the first time I saw it, I was just literally spellbound.  It was seriously like my eyes were seeing heaven for the first time.  The clouds parted, the beams of light shone through, and there was Christine, singing her glorious little heart out.  The second thing that was ingrained in my head was that Gerard Butler was horribly bad in the title role.  While he carried with him a believable angst, his vocal power is just horrible.  He was off key, sloppy and lacked any grace and beauty (vocally) that is needed to carry this role.I have said numerous times that vocal strength is the most important thing when casting a musical, but throwing a vocally retarded actor like Pierce Brosnan a role in `Mama Mia!' is no where near as offensive as handing the coveted and prominent role of THE PHANTOM to an actor who cannot do it justice.So, as I settled in the other night to give this another whirl I started to realize that the film, while visually captivating (don't let anyone tell you otherwise), this film adaptation is missing something special...heart.While Emmy Rossum is stellar as Christine, she cannot carry this film on her own.  The main emotional focal point here is The Phantom, and Butler is not capable of making him a truly transcendent human being.  Because we are restricted from really seeing his face, it is his voice that needs to reach us, and Gerard is not able to do that.  While the story is still presented to us in whole form, it doesn't capture the emotional impact of previous adaptations (and of the stage play), even if this version is the most theatrical.  Of all the film adaptations, this is the most lavish and visually appealing, and it is the one that most resembles (visually) the stage play.  But, visuals are not everything, and sadly that is ALL that this film really provides.Aside from Rossum, who is, as I mentioned, stellar.As far as the supporting cast is concerned, the only standout for me was Minnie Driver, whose comedic performance is shrieky but memorably so.  She is funny and spunky and adds a nice touch to the film.  Patrick Wilson may be pretty (and his voice is immaculate) but he is awfully wooden here and totally forgettable.  I like him as an actor (especially his 06 work), but here he is just another set piece; something to look at but never truly `feel'.So, I recommend this because it is a captivating film, but it is not one that you will really take anything away from.  As the years have gone by I wondered why this film really escaped my memory where others have lingered so vividly.  Watching this again helped me understand why.	3.0	A very, very pretty shell of a film...	2010-01-07	5	3	2

Jennifer Ellison (playes Meg Giry), would have made a better Christine if she was a little louder. It did add some comfort when Raoul steped on stage, he was the best actor of all.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3C37W8WGMV8UQ	Angela Dalecki	"With the recent revival of movie musicals in Hollywood (Moulin Rouge!, Chicago), it seemed inevitable that eventually, a big-name composer and a big-name director would try to convert a big-name Broadway musical to film. Sure enough, Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera, a Joel Schumacher film, opened in select cities on December 22.A quick note: If you don't like musical theatre, or if you've seen Phantom on Broadway and hated it, or if you think Andrew Lloyd Webber should be tried for crimes against humanity because of his music...I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that you're not going to be crazy about this adaptation. However, if you're not in that particular category of people (and I hope you're not), then I'm willing to bet that you'll like this movie.If you're not familiar with the stage show, here's a quick summary of the story: Christine Daa&eacute; is a young ing&eacute;nue at the Paris Opera House. She's been taking music lessons from an unseen master who is referred to by the dancers as the ""Phantom of the Opera."" The Phantom is actually a disfigured man who lives beneath the opera house, and is...well, a little psychotic. The Phantom is in love with Christine, and while she feels a very strong attraction towards him, she's also in love with her childhood sweetheart, Raoul. The majority of the movie details the Phantom's growing obsession with Christine and the lengths he'll go to make her love him back.I adored this movie. I think the story and the music transferred brilliantly from stage to screen. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher made some excellent decisions regarding the plot-although there are some major changes from the stage version, the result is a simply brilliant film adaptation. Fans and critics have been especially divided over the director's choice of casting, so I'll take a few minutes to discuss the three principal characters: the Phantom, Christine, and Raoul.Gerard Butler (Dracula 2000, Timeline) plays the title character. His performance has spurred more heated discussions and arguments among fans than any other actor in the movie-mostly because he's not a classically trained singer, and his voice has a much rougher edge to it than most of the actors who have played the Phantom on Broadway. However, Butler is a stupendous actor and manages to convey the Phantom's pain and loneliness more effectively than any stage actor I've ever seen. And his untrained voice actually complements that raw pain and emotion.Christine is played by Emmy Rossum (The Day After Tomorrow, Mystic River). Rossum shows off a lovely soprano voice in the film. She's a little weak on some of the higher notes, but she's young, and her voice hasn't fully developed yet. Her acting, however, is excellent. She's consistently able to portray her conflicting fear and desire for the Phantom, and she seems genuinely torn between the Phantom and Raoul, played by Patrick Wilson.Wilson (Angels in America) was the first principal cast for the movie-and with good reason. He has a lovely voice, and he manages to give real depth to the normally thankless role of Raoul.Phantom also has a wonderful supporting cast. Special recognition, however, should go to Minnie Driver, who plays the opera diva, Carlotta. Her performance is hilarious, completely over-the-top, and thoroughly enjoyable.Beyond the individual performances, the music is beautiful (the singers are backed by a 100-piece orchestra, which you'll never get in live theatre), the sets are breathtaking, and the costumes are absolutely stunning. The eye and ear candy alone make this DVD worth buying, but the special features are also a lot of fun.  I just wish they had included a running commentary."	5.0	Wonderful--I wish I could give it more stars!	2005-05-21	13	12	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3SP5ZIEJM4TTI	Angela D. Cabrera	I love the music. I thought Emma Rossum's voice is better for this role than Sarah Brightman. Gerald Butler is adequate but not a standout for the role. I like him...just not in this. Movies sort of fill in gaps and this one does to some extent but it suffers from mediocre performances (except Emma's).	4.0	Phantom, the movie	2013-10-21	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A32KUYGQ5L4DH0	Angela T. Thompson	"The film production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical ""The Phantom of the Opera"" certainly plants itself in one's mind.  Webber, Mackintosh, and Schumacher have created a beautiful, rich, and sensual production that has brilliantly translated the stage musical to film.  The caste, both major and minor, are superb.  That attention to detail in costume, set, and casting that makes even the minor characters interesting and appealing gives depth to the film.  Gerard Butler as the phantom is inspiring in his gruff voice and the only phantom that I have seen or heard, other than Colm Wilkinson, that makes the part believable and passionate.  By the end of this story about a classic love triangle of innocent love and obsessive love, one understands and sympathizes with Butler's phantom.  Emmy Rossum has a such a versatile voice from deep and sexy to operatic for one so young.  Patrick Wilson, with a lovely voice, plays the typical romantic.  Simon Callow and the others provide needed comic relief.  But it is Minnie Driver, who for me, is perhaps the most memorable character of them all, and one of the best songs is ""Learn to be Lonely"" that she sings at the end.I had previously purchased a one-disc edition that had just the movie.  When I read that the 2-disc version had the ""making of the stage musical and movie"" sections and another song that did not make it into the movie--although it should have--, I ordered it and have watched it constantly ever since:  a set well worth having in one's collection."	5.0	The Phantom There in My Mind	2005-09-28	6	6	0

Read/seen/listened to every possible variation I could get my hands on.This is my new all-time favorite.I admit I had my reservations prior to seeing it. Once I did, 99.9% of them were put to rest. Butler BECAME ""The"" Phantom for me, and I used to be a complete ""Crawford-or-no-one"" supporter. I really enjoyed his interpretation of the role. Wilson did a superb job as Raoul -- his is the only interpretation of the part that didn't make me want to just kick him. I could never understand what (other than his money) made Raoul attractive to Christine, but in this version, he's actually got substance. Finally!I can't recommend this movie highly enough, both for those familiar with Phantom and those new to it.

I was so thrilled! lolAnyhow, the story was very good, and I would add another comment, but don't want to spoil it for anyone else.I absolutely loved having Gerard Butler in this. It was the first time I'd ever seen him in a character like this.And surprised when I heard him singing. That was awesome and slightly odd at the same time. lol But not gonna knockit at all! Love it! If you are a Gerry fan and love a good chick flick, mixed with lots of opera then you'll love this movie.Honestly, I have never seen the Phantom before this. So this was just amazing to me. I can only imagine how it mustbe to see it on a live stage.Bottom line, Loved this movie!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AOG3CUANS3773	Angie Fox	I kinda understand why this movie gets mixed reviews from movie critics but ravings for its DVD version.It's not the adrenaline pumping, suspenses popping, twists tangling ,your typical fast paced  Hollywood roller coaster  ride that people normally expect for $12+ popcorn and soda cost. the age old Gothic storyline has been adapted and copied for a century, but this adaption is as updated as you can imagine, the original book is rather loosely organized and the story line is tacky from the view of  contemporary readers(it's kindle version is free for a reason).But unlike some big Hollywood productions put on DVDs, you will probably watch the DVD once or twice and put away, this one you just can't get enough of it.The scenes were spectaculars, and the music is just purely beautiful for the ears. never was a fan for musical before, but phantom got me hooked.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A39FJV2G99WGQI	Anibeth	I prefer the Original London Cast to the recently released movie version of the Phantom of the Opera. While the singing by Meg certainly is even much better than the London Cast version for her 'immature' or 'childlike' singing, the movie version defeats the purpose where Christine is forced to compete with Meg for the starring role. While Emmy Rossum's voice sounded more fuller in body comparable to Sarah Brightman's angelic singing, Emmy Rossum's robust voice outshines the title role by the Phantom, as played by Gerard Butler. The voice of Butler's while excellent in acting, which was his powerful role yet, fell flat in his voice as compared to Michael Crawford's superior, and yet, powerful, seductive and emotional range of voice techniques. Crawford would have been better chosen for the movie role if he had reprised his role in his favor over Butler's. Butler's acting voice while powerful, and raw, show very little emotion and flexibility that Crawford exhibited during his powerful performance in the London stage version of the Phantom of the Opera. The exception to this flaw was the very poor performance of Carlotta as sung by Minnie Driver. I feel that Minnie Driver would make a fine actress and less of a singer because her voice is not too flexible in power, is quite harsh, and less fluid and refined like Rosemary Ashe who did have a starring role as Carlotta in the London version. Patrick Wilson, was very impressive as the Vicompte Raoul de Chagny. He might have a better future in a musical film than Butler's whose voice was less than pure comparable to Michael Crawford's. I think that Michael Crawford would have a better chance in performing the role of the Phantom, had he been chosen over Butler.The film was less interesting and less exciting, other than the fight scene, though I would prefer to see the Phantom throw flaming skulls rather than using the sword like a typical swordsman. Other non-magical scenes such as his revealing disappearance defeats the mystery of how the Phantom disappears when shown during the somewhat-colorful Mascarade scene.Overall, while some scenes were interesting to view, most of them were unnecessary, jarring and cluttered with clumsily made plots, special effects that were not too mysterious, but too revealing and some acting, while good in one portion of the film, was not a definite plus over the highly rated Original casting of Phantom of the Opera.While I do recommend people to see the movie version of the Phantom of the Opera, the film's awkwardness and cluttered presentation  made possible by the producers, and directors, will continued to be outshined by the best rated Original London musical.To prove it, why not listen to the cd of the Phantom of the Opera, Original London cast to find out for yourself how beautiful and inspiring it really is.	3.0	Movie not good enough to be ranked a five star	2006-04-09	6	2	4

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AKH9SCCIYSSGJ	anna-joelle	"Don't believe the negative reviews of this film! I almost didn't watch it myself after reading the mixed reviews. But I'm glad I didn't miss it because Joel Schumacher's ""Phantom of the Opera"" is simply one of the best movies of 2004 (together with ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Collateral"") and deserves loads of nominations come Oscar time. It's a splendid, no-expense spared production and features a first-rate cast and the most beautiful of costumes and set decoration.The 3 lead actors, Gerald Butler (as the Phantom), Emmy Rossum (Christine) and Patrick Wilson (Raoul) are brilliant in their respective role and (guess what?) they could really sing!! Their voice is sheer perfection. Gerald's is suitably strong and passionate while Patrick's will make you fall in love with Raoul. As for Emmy, she sings most 'dolce' and has to be the best 'Christine' ever (she could give any WestEnd ""Christines"" a run for their money with her beauty and vocal talent). Her performance is unforgetable and I simply love her crystal-clear voice (especially in the song ""Think of Me"").Some of the most magnificent scenes:1. in the beginning, when the broken chandelier is 'raised' to the accompaniment of the musical's powerful Overture.2. the Phantom leading Christine to his secret lair as the theme song is sung.3. the spectacular fall of the chandelier towards the end of the film.There is no doubt that this film is a labor of love from the producer/songwriter, Andrew Lloyd Webber and the director, Joel Schumacher. If there's fairness in the movieworld, this film will receive a Best Picture nomination and Gerald and Emmy will both get Best Acting noms at the coming Oscars. To me, ""Phantom of the Opera"" is far more enjoyable, romantic and beautiful to watch than the other 2 musicals that came out in the past few years (i.e. ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Chicago"" which did well at the Oscars, but trust me that ""Phantom of the Opera"" is superior to those two in every aspect and it certainly has far more memorable songs!).This film is a true feast for the senses. Just sit back and let the drama, color and  music 'wash' over you. You'll leave the theatre in love all over again with Andrew Lloyd Webber's music (as I was, especially with the Phantom's signature tune, ""Angel of Music"", ""Think of Me"", ""All I Ask of You"" and ""Music of the Night"")."	5.0	Spectacular!	2005-01-02	6	6	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3FRQSRDMTFE6J	"Anna the Bard ""Renaissance Bard"""	"Phantom is one of my favorite musicals, and this film is overall quite satisfying.Gerard Butler delivers a superb, moving performance as the haunted Phantom, and is by far the most expressive actor.  The other really good actor is Minnie Driver (Carlotta).  I'm used to seeing her play benevolent side-characters, so it was interesting to see her be a sort of leading bi*** girl that nobody really likes, and speaking Italian.  ""Christine"", although she has a truly lovely voice, is somewhat bland as far as acting and expression, as is ""Raul"" who is even more so.  The acting of these two is all that keeps me from giving this film 5 Stars.The scenery is wonderful, which was a relief to me, having seen so many stage-to-film adaptations that rather disappointing.  It is filmed on different locations besides the opera house.  The costumes are also quite spectacular, though secondary to the main story.Those who adore musical theater should definitely include this in their collection."	4.0	A Treasure for Phantom Fans	2011-04-27	0	0	0

Joe Schumacher did a marvelous job in picking the cast and creating a movie which far surpasses any theatrical version I've ever seen.  He did so much more with the movie than one could ever do on stage.  He picked the perfect pair to play the Phantom and Christine.  One has to read the book to see why Gerard and Emmy were so in tune with the book version and Gaston Leroux's Phantom and the love of his life.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves beautiful music, great cinematography, and a poignant love story which is for the ages.	5.0	Phantom of the Opera is fantastic	2005-02-28	10	7	3

It will be immortal -- along with The Red Shoes, and Tales of Hoffman.  It demands complete and utter surrender. All the acting and singing were extraordinary, and the story itself has a great smoldering and unforgettable power.  Seeing this film took me right back to childhood when my mother told me the whole story of The Phantom of the Opera based on the early films she'd seen before my time.  Not a single disappointment anywhere.  It seemed a perfect delivery of Andrew Lloyd Webber's genius.  What courage it must have taken at every stage to conceive of and execute something so pure and sensuous and divinely extreme.

I mainly ordered it because I am a huge Gerard Butler fan and was curious about how he would do in a musical.  His portrayal of the Phantom was well done.  I thought the casting was very well done.  Mr. Butler does not have a beautiful operatic voice, but that is not what his role called for so he cannot be judged harshly for it.  This movie IS a musical.  there is no spoken dialogue.

It's still Weber's music, after all.I wish I could say the rest of  the movie was as good as the play, but it definitely falls short. The changes, I suspect, were made so the movie would appeal to a younger generation, but the movie lacks the power of the play. Also, the play's shortcomings seem more emphasized in the movie. The TV version of Phantom of the Opera, starring Charles Dance, tells a much more believable story.Too bad Weber's music and the Dance movie can't be merged!	4.0	Weber's Phantom of the Opera	2006-03-03	3	1	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1FE06N5A77K8W	Annie Feng	"Everyone(at least from those I heard) said this movie was sooooo amazing and that I HAVE to go see it. So I said, sure and rented this movie along with Lemony Snicket.Well, I have to say that I was VERY disappointed. Usually when I finish watching a movie, I either instantly LOVE it or instantly Hate it, especially those movies which are not just for entertainment purposes. So after watching Phantom, I'll have to say I didn't like it. I thought about why I didn't like it all day and finally I'm set to writing this review.The Plot: let's see...beautiful but dumb and simple female main character; love at first sight with no development what-so-ever; and no matter how much they try to stress the whole comparison between the inwardness of human beings to the outwardness of human beings, they still come back to ""judge a book by its cover please"". That's how I felt about the plot, so incredibly cliche with almost no new ideas at all. The whole love triangle is pretty silly. I mean, the phantom has endured mistreatment for his whole entire life because of his face, he's shocked about Christine not falling for him??? So yeah, ya'll gonna say, well he has rage within him. But that just proves how cliche the story is.So okay, let's not talk about the plot anymore, since it is written in eariler time, people are stupid and close-minded in eariler time. let's just talk about the movie itself. Well, I think I would like the movie much better if it weren't a musical. The musical of the movie is just soooo incredibly awkward. I think it's because phantom is like a mystery, but singing is to reveal, and since they don't want to reveal too much, the singing is just repeats and repeats. The conversation in singing is awkward too, I mean, the phantom was swearing while still singing like when he sing ""damn you! damn you!"" geez, awkward!The music itself was provocative, but it's been ruined by cheesy lyrics. if you are familiar with Lemony Snicket, you know that it's a very cheesy movie. But alot of the lines in Lemony Snicket matches Phantom with its tone. such as in Lemony Snicket: Children, I am your beloved Count Olaf; you then look at phantom of the opera: Christine, I am your Angel of Music, sound familiar? that's right, they both have the ""ta da"" chessiness.The acting was mediocre. The character developments in Phantom have almost NO transition at all. I mean, after all the time with phantom, Christine NOW feels scared??? After all the time with phantom Christine suddenly falls for another man and that's that??? Christine kisses the phantom and just like that the phantom's evilness dissolves???? The acting wasn't bad, Emmy Rosumbum did pretty good as a new actress. But really, most of the goodies in the acting is just that they sing well. So yeah, Emmy can definitely sing. But if you just watch a movie to watch singing, I would rather buy CDs or download music.Overall, I really didn't like the movie, it's really rather boring. I heard the book was so much better that it makes more sense-that is, the motive of phantom's evilness makes more sense. so maybe I'll take a shot at that, but the movie really could use improvement."	3.0	disappointed	2005-05-31	10	2	8

No substitute for the chandelier crashing over your head in a live theater, but then looking a Gerard Butler makes up for it. His Phantom was frightening and powerful, making his obsession with Cristine intriguing. Genius casting of fairly unknowns.

However, I am willing to give the seller the benefit of the doubt on this--and I am beginning to actually prefer VHS to DVD--VHS is more likely to be error-free, and DVD--even brand-new--is getting to be a roll of the dice.  What bugged me most, though, was the non-response from the seller when I asked for suggestions.  I did not ask for my money back, only for suggestions, but no response whatsoever.  Again, I'll give the benefit of the doubt, and assume the seller didn't receive my email. But, whatever--you may be sure I will order no products from SpookyKid in future.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A34DY6QNGDRXE1	Anonymous	This movie is superb! I really loved the stage musical but this is ten times better...no, a hundred times better. I even had people who said they disliked the stage version comment on how great this film is. I don't understand why the critics are so harsh when the viewers are enjoying it. I should know, I've seen it nine times already...and I'm not the only one.There are some prominent changes from the stage version, but if you've never seen the stage version this movie is just as enjoyable. Gerard Butler did a phenomenal job. I myself was a little leary of him, knowing he's no Michael Crawford, but now I like him a lot better than Michael Crawford. He makes the Phantom more emotional, powerful, and more easier to sympathize with. Gerard definately deserved an Oscar nod for his role, but that's neither here nor there.I won't give away any of the surprises of the film, but I will tell you something...you won't be disappointed. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll get mad, you'll feel sad, you'll want to jump for joy, then you'll want to throw things...it's a very emotional piece and not just for women (believe it or not, more men have cried in the theater than women).This is a must buy! You may even want two copies because you will wear out one of them for sure.	5.0	Don't Let The Critics Fool You!	2005-02-18	13	11	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A32X3PGY5VLNPG	Anth	I saw phantom of the opera in January, I have seen the play about 2 times and just loved it. The movie really does a good job of going from the Stage to the screen. Now if you are die hard about this play being exactly like it is on stage then I will tell you now that you are not going to like it. The movie had to manuver certain aspects of the play to make it all flow together for the screen.The singers are wonderful, even though it is supposedly an opera there are no opera singers in the movie, in the traditional sense, but then again the play didn't have any true opera singers. Michael Crawford will forever be the phantom in many people's minds and sarah brightman is christine, yet these cast members make a memorable preformance and just take the play to a new level. I will say that they cast each role perfectly, I never like raoul in the play because he was too much of a righteous guy that he just got on my nerves, in the movie he is exactly the same way.Take the oppourtunity to experience this movie and just sit back relax and enjoy. I loved this movie and am so glad that it is coming out on DVD soon, the music and story are just so enchanting that it will never get old.	5.0	Not the play and just as good	2005-04-30	4	3	1

The visuals are stunning and the story is enhanced as only film can bring it to you. For the first time you will get some real backstory of the Phantom. The music is richer thanks to a super sized orchestra and the actors all did a wonderful job singing. Emmy Rossum's voice is beautiful and I liked it more than Brightman's! Gerard Butler is great and does an admirable job singing. He is not a trained singer but he brings an edge to the role. His vocal style is rough and I believe it works for the phantom. A great movie and should please all.NOW MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: Beautiful picture and sound. Nothing mind blowing and not a DEMO DISC to show off your Blu Ray power.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2EL3990HXOMZB	Antonio Robert	"Produced and overseen by auteur Andrew Lloyd Webber, ""Phantom of the Opera"" may go down as the definitive film version of the oh-so-often-filmed musical. The music is as beautiful as ever (""All I Ask of You"", ""Music of the Night"" ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again""), acting and singing is very decent, not detracting from the overall romantic and mysterious mood, and - perhaps the most typical for the film is its lavish, almost vain, production. You bet it must have suited Mr Webber, known for his perfectionism, fine. The only setback is that the film came perhaps a little too late in time. Had it come a decade or two earlier (maybe when Webber's then-wife Sarah Brightman's crossover career was in its prime), it would have scored higher critical success and more of the deserved awards. Still, this 2004 version offers quite much and more than two hours for modern musical lovers will be by no means lost."	4.0	Lavish, Faithful Phantom (3.5 stars)	2009-04-25	1	1	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1KD8QGRNYCZ2W	Anya	I, in all honesty, loved this film. I have never seen the stage version {I'm only 13, and my parents aren't made of money}but I have heard multiple recordings. I personally like most of the cast from the Movie Recording better. Gerard Butler has that exquisite, seductive voice needed for the Phantom. Emmy Rossum was really the only one I didn't like. IT might have been better if it wasn't so obvious she was lip syncing in the scenes. Being a music student, I know you can't sing with a big huge smile.Other than that, I loved it. I especially liked how the Opera house was 'brought to life'. The scenery and stuff was amazing. It's definitely worth buying. I saw it twice in theaters, and plan on adding this to my Musical Collection when I get money.	5.0	A Musical Fanatics view	2005-11-12	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AU5OL66GGSX5P	"April Hamilton ""Opera Fan"""	I just finished reading several reviews of this movie and was very disappointed that so many of you enjoyed the singing so much! Andrew Lloyd Weber composed a gorgeous score with stunning lyrics to match! Ms. Emmy Rossum might have a pretty voice to sing a solo at a contemporary church service, but when casting Christine, one needs to look for a REAL singer! I much preferred the singing voice of Carlotta! (I know Minnie Driver was dubbed. She did an EXCELLENT job acting!) Her dub was a  legit singing voice! Rossum would not be heard without a microphone and the voice was whiny and shrill. I was hoping Carlotta would remain the lead in their opera! Before I continue with my negative comments, I will say I enjoyed Patrick Wilson! Another legit voice - a pop / musical theatre sound, but a pretty one! Thank you! The WORST element of this movie was Gerard Butler, the Phantom! In a musical, shouldn't the voice be the MOST important element!! He did not have one! He shouted his notes, he sang off pitch. It was ugly! The Phantom needs to be hideous on the outside but have a mysteriously beautiful voice that refletcts his inner goodness! His performance made me cringe! What a shame! Such a gorgeous story line, with a beautiful set, costumes and yes, the people were gorgeous!! But it was ruined by the casting! Two of the leads were not fit for their parts vocally! I await the day when people realize what a good sounding instrument is and hire someone for it!!... not just go out searching for a pretty face! There is much talent out there!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A16CI5I7DD3X4X	A. Rambo	"I don't often review movies but I had to this time. What a simply beautiful film this is. You do yourself a disservice in not seeing it simply because you're afraid it might be different from the versions you may have viewed before, be it a horror film or a stage musical.This version is, basically, the story of a classic love-triangle. Anyone can take the original 1911 novel and infer that from what Gaston Leroux wrote almost one hundred years ago.So there you have it; it's about a love triangle. This version is the most stunning I've ever watched. As far as all the complaints and negative reviews, both by the critics and the populace...it's hard to understand you all.This is not a Michael Crawford/Sarah Brightman movie. So try to understand that. This is something different; it's not meant to be the same thing as the play. What purpose would that have? I had the pleasure of seeing Michael Crawford do the role in LA and he was good. I enjoyed it very much indeed. I liked the CD with the above two singers very much as well.But this isn't them. This is different. The Phantom character in this version does not have a fabulously trained voice;  he isn't supposed to. Few teachers have that, you know. It's not a stretch to create a Phantom who doesn't have a perfect voice; what is such a stretch in having the character being a brilliant and talented man in many ways, but who naturally has a darker, more rock-style voice rather than an operatic voice? And what is wrong with Christine being a young ingenue, the way she was in the book, instead of a 30-plus stage actress with a trained voice? She's 17 and she sounds like it. Good for her.For all you ""phans"", Gerard has a deeper, more masculine sounding voice than Crawford and shows a lot more hetero sexuality onscreen than Crawford could ever manage. And Emmy has just the right touch of innocence and malleability. The rest of the cast is also very good and Joel Schumacher created genius in the cinematography and amazing special effects; so subtle are they that you believe what you are seeing is *real*.Don't miss this on the big screen if you can help it; I don't think you'll be sorry, if you can bring yourself to have an open mind and realize this is a movie, not a stage musical and try to get over the fact it's not the stylistic type of singing you are used to. And that's done on purpose; it's not a mistake. I like the choices they made and the direction they took. Bravo, to all involved! You succeeded."	5.0	Gorgeous and Magical	2004-12-31	3	3	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A13D5JJBEIVM2B	"Ardenta ""Ardenta"""	"Having seen the musical on broadway, I waited breathlessly to see the movie. But as I held the DVD in my hand, for one moment I wondered if it could be even close to as good as the stage production. But, casting doubts aside, I slid the moive into my DVD player, and gasped in awe as the haunting sound of the music filled my ears.Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical The Phantom of the Opera tells the amazing story of Christine Daae, the daughter of a swedish violinist, orphaned when her father died. She is taken in by the Opera house and trained as a chorus girl. As she rises from background singer to leading lady, Christine meets up with Raoul, her childhood sweetheart. But Christine has a dark secret. She has been taking lessons from an ""angel of music"" a man whose name she does not know. He tutors her, sings to her. Eventually he kidnaps her and takes her deep into his palace of darkness. He, the angel of music, more commonly known as the phantom of the opera, loves Christine. Deformed from birth, the phantom wears a mask. He is another child taken in by the opera house. But he and Christine are on opposite ends of the spectrum, she was raised with love before she came to the opera house, he with scorn, they are embodiments of light and dark. Both drawn to eachother. The Phantom loves Christine and when he takes her for a second time, Raoul persues them through the labyrinth where night is blind, and finds the Phantom. He begs for Christine's release.... and I won't tell you the rest, because I hate to spoil an ending that will bring tears to your eyes.Every aspect of this movie is spectacular! The acting, the plot, the singing. I have a new FAVORITE movie.""You will regret the day you did not do, all that the Phantom asked of you!!!!"""	5.0	All that the Phantom asked of you!	2005-05-10	6	4	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A35XZATP8A1LWC	A. Reichert	"The visual experience of this film is top-notch.  Very good directing, set design, costumes, cinematography, etc.  Joel Schumacher should be saluted for his big-screen adaptation of a very moving stage show.  In particular, I think the transitions between ""then"" and ""now"" are a very nice touch to an already grandiose and elegant story.  And Minnie Driver's Carlotta is a good enough reason in itself to see the movie.  She's hilarious.But then there's the singing.  The Phantom of The Opera is the one musical I will go out of my way to see.  There's just something about the story and the music.  They're both hypnotizing.  But the success of the production in my mind has everything to do with the quality of the voices in the pivotal roles (i.e. Raoul, Christine, and The Phantom).  If these three players are cast well, the story is a sight to behold.  If not, it's a tough story to sit through.Patrick Wilson's Raoul is the best of the three.  He has the look AND the voice that I would expect in that character.  He's the dashing suitor with the good looks, good intentions, and sweet voice.  Wilson plays his part perfectly.  He's not overbearing and he, for the most part, hits all the right notes.Emmy Rossum tries valiantly to play the ""damsel in continuous distress"" that is Christine.  She tries...but it's just not enough.  When it comes to the demure Christine who misses her father and who is humble about her talent as a singer, Rossum is adequate and even endearing at times.  But when Christine is supposed to be a strong, proud woman who realizes who she is and how she's being unfairly torn between what she wants and what others want from her...Emmy just isn't believable.  She's got a good voice (i.e. she can carry a tune pretty well)...but it's a small voice.  In my opinion, Christine's voice should be every bit as powerful as Carlotta's (after all, they're supposed to be competing with each other for the lead in the Opera Populaire's performances).  And you should be able to feel Christine's anger over being a pawn in the love triangle between her, The Phantom, and Raoul.  Emmy comes off as a scared, meek little girl throughout the story.And then there's The Phantom.  In my opinion, Gerard Butler was chosen for this role solely because of his looks (which is, in itself, counterintuitive because of his character's deformity).  I can't see how there could be any other justification for his selection as the namesake of what I consider to be Andrew L. Weber's crowning achievement.  Once again, visually the Phantom is right on.  Butler pulls off the mannerisms and the visual portrayal of the Phantom's anguish.  And his costumes are and absolutely perfect reflection of his dark, yet elegant status.  It's an understatement to say that he looks the part.  But the man simply cannot sing.  The Phantom is supposed to be Christine's teacher...and she comes off sounding at least 10 times better than he does.  His voice is downright laughable during all of his parts but I found his vocals exceptionally inadequate during songs where he's supposed to be showing intense emotions (Music Of The Night and Masquerade come to mind).  The louder he is, the more squeamish I get.  God bless him...he's trying.  But playing the role of The Phantom to its utmost is a tall order to fill even for well-trained and talented vocalists.  The only time Mr. Butler sounds like he belongs in the role is when he's whispering.  That's as much as I can give him.So I give the film 3 stars...mostly for visuals.  There are the occasional stand-outs vocally but simply changing the casting of either Christine or The Phantom would have easily earned a 4 or 5 star rating in my book."	4.0	Visually excellent.

What a wonderful movie, gorgeous sets, music, actors, and voices.Gerard Butler said this in an interview""so I wanted to become as technically good as I could. Honestly, I wanted to hear his life story in every note, which therefore I think weakens him up in the beginning because I always felt even through ""Music of the Night"" that even in his more seductive moments it was tinged with pain. Like he always knew this wasn't going to be for him. It was a controlled yet desperate attempt at something he knew he wasn't going to have any luck in. Maybe it was too much, but it was my instinctive feeling when I first read it ...You did an excellent job, Mr. Butler.

While Christine in this film is not Sarah Brighman, although accetpably close, the phantom's voice in the film captures the underlying anger which is absent from the original soundtrack.  The libretto (close captioning) is quite useful when the score travels into the song Prima Donna; the liberties taken from the original musical enhance the story; and, of course, there are just some things which cannot be accomplished on stage which are easily accomplished today with cinema technology.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1G2G3BIPVUUGL	Arlene Montemayor	"This movie is so perfect. It is a thriller/ romantic movie. The Phantom is inlove with a singer/performer named Kristine who is one of the protagonists in the movie, but her heart longs for someone else. Half of the Phantom's face is seriously disfigured, and he was hiding part of his face with a mask so that people can't see it. It is truly entertaining. I love the casts. The lovely Emmy Rossum (Kristine)possess such a powerful voice. I especially like her duet with Patrick Wilson (Rauol), who is not only handsome, but also a talented broadway singer. The plot of the movie is very interesting and the performance of the actors, especially Gerard Butler is extremely moving...... I'm glad they chose a handsome and sexy actor to play the Phantom (Gerard Butler). I have never seen the original Phantom of the Opera, but some people say that in the original rendition, the Phantom was an older man and an antithesis of the new Phantom. I think viewers might even be moved with the story. The actions committed by the Phantom are deplorable such as his murderous rampage, but you can't help but feel emphaty for the lonely soul.His pitiful experiences and his obsession with Kristine drove him into madness.  I love Gerard's performance and his eyes seem to show deep emotions; it is extremely convincing. Gerard Butler's delivery is amazing. His voice is also perfect for his role. He was able to show the mysteriousness and the passion of the Phantom with his acting skills and his voice. I never regret buying this movie. I love it!!!!!!!!!!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2XQ6R0LXU823T	Art Fanatic	I LOVE this movie so much. I saw it in theatres twice, bought the special edition soundtrack, and now have added this movie to my collection. It is amazing! You probably already know the storyline. Gerard Butler plays the Phantom, Emmy Rossum plays Christine and Patrick Wilson plays Raoul. I think they all did a superb job, I love Gerard Butler as the Phantom. He has an edge to him that makes him a good phantom, and he is a good singer. It is hard to believe that Emmy Rossum was only 16 when she made this movie, she has the voice of an angel! Patrick Wilson plays a good knight on a white horse. In this movie, Raoul has a more prominent role, and actually IS a hero on a white horse. You get more of a sense of why Christine is so torn between these two men. In the play, Raoul wasn't that noticable!On the second disc, there are some interesting tidbits. There is a history of the Phantom of the Opera itself. It mostly shows the London musical play though, which is disappointing. I admit, I did not watch all of it. There is also a Making Of Phantom of the Opera, the movie, which is really interesting. It's at least half an hour, and talks about all aspects of the movie including the dancing, costumes, sets, props, and actors. That is a really interesting bit. Thirdly there is a additional scene featuring the Phantom. It has Gerard Butler singing a version of &quot;Learn to be Lonely&quot;, except personalized for the Phantom. It is an interesting scene, because it shows more of the phantom's lair, and an inside look at his world. It shows his sentimental side :) Also, some people may not have noticed, but below the scene there is another button you can highlight, and if you click it it opens a sing a long. You get the whole backstage crew and some of the cast singing The Phantom of the Opera. It is quite funny to watch!All in all, this is a great addition to any Phantom Phan's collection. I hope this has been of help!	5.0	Enchanting	2005-05-31	6	5	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1X1N1RHFIOCRF	arthistoryguy	"Having never seen the musical performed on stage (and knowing only bits and pieces of the story) I was eager to see the original Andrew Lloyd Webber songs and storyline played out on screen.  I had to know what the hype was about -- after all, it's the most recognized musical in history.  I know the songs far better than I know what the songs are about.While it is a rare double-threat to be a great actor and singer at the same time, it's not impossible (I.E. Julie Andrews, Barbara Streisand, Liza Minnelli).  I kept thinking, as I watched, that there must have been a tremendous amount of pressure placed upon the filmmakers to cast an artist who can do both, and do both well.  Here, the creators seem to have opted more for the acting slant versus vocal ability -- and I agree that was, perhaps, the better of the two talents to emphasize in the film version.  Still, I can't help but think there might be a perfect young Christine out there waiting to be inserted into this production, and certainly there is an actor/singer who could hit the Phantom's notes without a rather annoying rustic, country-rock squalor?Emmy Rossum, the actress who takes on the role of Christine here (whom you may remember from ""The Day After Tomorrow"") is a decent performer with a history in musical productions.  She can sing fine (though I find it hard-pressed to call her a possible opera star, unlike Sarah Brightman for whom the role was penned in 1985 by then-husband Webber).  She doesn't sing strongly enough to make me believe that she could command an Opera stage.  Gerard Butler, who plays the Phantom, seems like a melodramatic resident from Melrose Place who decided he would like to start a rock band, but opted to live like a recluse in an Opera House's basement and somehow  train pretty young girls to sing like, well, Sarah Brightman.  Strange casting in the role of the Phantom, as much as I enjoy Butler's other work.  Patrick Wilson, who plays Christine's legitimate love-interest, belts his songs out fine, if not dry and uninspired.  This is a film that makes the concept of real singers singing the parts and then real actors mouthing those pre-recorded tracks seem like a better idea; everything music-wise is a tinge too mediocre.  It's as if a decent filmmaker is attempting to produce an album.The cinematography shines.  It's a beautiful film... most of the time.  The sweeping camera shots, warm, vibrant colors, spectacular sets and costumes, and antique French charm is often entrancing.  The Paris opera scene comes to vivacious life.  Yet, the cumbersome black and white flash-forward scenes are treated with as much emotional depth as a Madonna or Prince music video from the 1980's.  It's when we're at the stage, back stage, and in the audience of the opera house -- watching elegant fake elephants trot across the stage and chandeliers crash to the ground in a fiery blaze -- that the movie comes together in the finest way.If you're a die-hard fan of the stage musical I can't imagine that you'll be terribly blown away with this big-screen interpretation.  If you're curious as to what story fits the fantastic original Webber tunes, you might like to check this one out on DVD.Grade: C"	3.0	A sometimes pretty & somtimes bland soap Opera	2005-03-24	8	5	3

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A5F7ES6QWXXB1	Ashley C. Murray	While the musical as a movie has not been commonly successful in recent years, this movie musical promises to be completely successful, and it is not hard to imagine why. It is the second longest running musical on Broadway (Cats is first), and was written at a time when nothing like it existed. The film does a great job of adapting the music, the story and the characters. Young Emmy Rossum does a phenomenal job as Christine Daae, with a voice to be envied.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AZ914SGGSHOL	A. Simpkins	This is truly a classic, The photography was incredible the movie was written well. The mistakes made in the film very obvious!!! Yet you really don't mind seeing a string down Butlers neck and one eye one color one moment then another color later. You sort of overlook the imperfections and fall in love with the character Erik. Gerard Butler did an amazing job, yet I do think at times he needed work on developing his character better, He was all over the place at times. You can still hear the scottish accent the actor has. Yet his singing was unique and went well with the character. All in all well worth it and enjoyed every minute of it. Rossum was almost perfect but a bit too young. Minnie Driver I thought was terrible. The fainting scene in the carriage was not funny, it was truly a bad performance.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AX33U7RZ5DGD3	A. Wallace	My husband took me to see Phantom of the Opera on stage twice.  I loved each performance, enjoying the different interpretations of the Phantom, Christina, the Count, Carlotta, etc.  When I received the movie version I was very excited.  And after seeing it I knew that I'd watch it over and over and over again.  It's a gem.What I enjoyed most is the close-ups.  Being able to see the emotions as well as to hearing them.  I couldn't help but think--the Count is the calm in Christina's life, and the Phantom is the storm.  Then, I thought of the Phantom and how much more in control he was when he wore the mask--the way he walked, how tall he stood, how commanding he appeared and sounded.  Carlotta was fun to watch and hear.  I know I've not mentioned any of the actors names in this review but I don't feel it's necessary.  They were all magnificent and I applaud them!

I saw a stage production in Toronto in '93 which was a Phantom 'fix' and have waited and waited for the movie. When it finally came to my small town I saw it three times in the two weeks it played. The first time was just overwhelming. When the first organ chords boomed out I thought I would burst into tears. The opening when the scene segues from present to past was stunning. Words are puny to describe everything I felt thoughout the whole movie. I cried everytime the Phantom said ""Christine"" just as I always do listening to Michael Crawford. It is so wonderful and much as I would have loved to see Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, this new cast does a terrific job. They must have felt the pressure of not being the originals. I've bought a larger screen TV, and am looking for a DVD player, all because of the Phantom.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A378G6WLNBDF6R	badbriar	I had seen this movie a while back, and wasn't crazy about it.  After watching the 25th anniversary production, I thought I'd give it another chance.  Not the best choice.  The look is spectacular, sets and costumes are great, but I wish that they had done a better job in casting.  The Phantom, Christine, and Rauol had good voices, but definitely not great, and these rolls call for Great Voices.  Couldn't they have chosen any one of the many actors and actresses who have played the roles on stage?  And I just didn't get the huge fascination that the Phantom and Rauol have for Christine - very little chemistry between any of them.  Emmy Rossum is lovely to look at, but I'm pretty sure that they had to do a new camera shot every time she had to change emotions or expressions (half of which seemed to involve her mouth hanging open like a fish, expecially in Past the Point of No Return).  The Phantom's makeup just wasn't frightening at all, no where near the really horrific makeup in the musical.  And why, after both of his eyes being dark for most of the movie, did his right eye turn pale blue after Christine ripped his mask off?The supporting cast did a great job (Minnie Driver was a bit over the top, but she was a diva, after all).  But they did a disservice to the musical by not casting the three principals better (and hey, I actually do like Patrick Wilson, just not in this role).	3.0	Should have trusted my judgement	2012-03-16	2	1	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1JS1ILAEQ2H5D	Baggy	"Having seen the stage show in Toronto several times, I found myself hoping a film would be made that managed to capture the romance, excitement and drama of that excellent production.  It was, therefore, with great anticipation that I watched this movie for the first time.  To my delight, it met and even surpassed my highest expectations.  The casting was inspired, and the producers managed to make the transition from theatre to big screen flawlessly, adding just minor embellishments that only enhanced the story.I suppose some might say that the voice of Gerard Butler as the Phantom may not be quite as polished as those before him, but it has a raw, sensual edge to it that exudes all the passion and longing of that tortured soul.  I enjoyed it so much, in fact, that I am adding the soundtrack to the Toronto cast recording CD that is already in my collection.As I watched the DVD, excitement began to course through me, and I realized that half way through I was feeling the same emotions that I had in Toronto, once again thinking ""I can hardly wait to come back.""  Indeed, I have come back many times since, and if I don't eventually wear out the DVD it won't be for trying.I LOVE this movie!"	5.0	No disappointments here	2005-06-06	3	1	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ANGH6401L9Y0T	"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93"""	"This is going to be a little different from my usual reviews, because I have been reading the book and then just got the movie. I haven't quite finished the book yet, but I can already tell you that the movie is more ""based on"" than really telling the same story.This is a stunning movie visually, and probably would be musically if my audio equipment was up to par. I was frustrated by not being able to understand the spoken word enough to be sure when they were talking and when singing. I think it is just because my headphones are pathetic, but it may be something more. Since this is almost an opera itself, it partakes of one of the problems I have always had with opera: I can seldom understand what they are saying, even when they sing in English. This is English, I can catch enough words to know that, but I had to do a lot of lip-reading and inferring from my knowledge of the story.Still, it is remarkable how much I was able to appreciate in spite of that problem. A lovely device at the outset of the movie and used periodically afterward is the way they switch back and forth between 1919 (I believe it is) and 188?, when the main part of the story took place. The part where the Opera House is in ruins and the old man in a wheelchair is remembering are in black and white, although some red gets in at times. Then as the auctioneer has the drop cloth pulled off the huge crystal chandelier, it begins to rise to its original position, throw off its gray dust and it becomes lit up again. As it rises, the whole theater gradually sweeps into color back in its former gilded age, and there we are in the past.The movie eliminated one fascinating character I had hoped to see, which is the Persian. Part of his role is absorbed into the dancers' mother, who is an employee of the Opera. Her daughter is a charming little blond and apparently Christine's closest friend. Christine (Emmy Rossum) is the very beautiful and under-appreciated soprano who takes over for the prima donna when she is sabotaged by the Phantom. The Phantom (Gerard Butler) is actually a human being, more or less, and has been giving Christine singing lessons invisibly by way of a pleasant little legend Christine's violinist father had told her about the Angel of Music. He pretends to be the Angel and trains Christine by hiding from her and therefore giving her the impression he is non-material and invisible. In fact, he's just horribly disfigured and wears a mask. The book and the movie disagree on how he became disfigured, so I won't meddle with that.The Phantom (named Erik in the book, but I don't recall that his name was ever used in the movie) lives in his own little world beneath the Opera house, in cellars and passageways that are partly involved in the functions of the theater, such as trap doors and heaters, and partly the result of the way the opera house was built on top of excavations that were used by the Commune as a prison during the revolution. He's fitted it all up with luxurious trappings, thousands of candles, his own miniature stage set on which he arranges operas with dolls, and a huge pipe organ.There is complexity to the Phantom's romancing of Christine in the form of Raoul, Vicomte de Chagney, a childhood friend of Christine's who renews contact with her after her first great triumph. He's young, handsome, titled, charming in every way, and falls completely in love with Christine. Or perhaps rekindles an old love for her. In any case Erik, the Phantom, sees him as a rival for the soprano's affection, and he does not play fair.I'll leave it to the movie to show you just how unfairly he can play. But then read the book, and compare. In my opinion, the book depicts much more macabre and inventive punishments for Erik's rival.No, of course I won't tell you the outcome. As to who wins, I figure that's the audience."	4.0	A Simply Beautiful Movie -- No, a Complex Beautiful Movie	2012-05-14	1	1	0

Josh Groban for instance.I will probably rewatch it in the future, but I will want to play the original cast recording as I mute the television.

His voice was a plain and vanilla sounding tone. Emmy Rossum had such a small voice that if she actually performed the role on stage without any cuts she would blow her voice out after the first performance. She has no vocal technique whatsoever. I think Gerard Butler is a great actor but he should never sing again. His voice sounded very strained and unpleasant to listen to.

Obivously, even if you've never seen the musical, you know that the movie version is going to be different because, well, you don't get the luxury of ""takes"" on stage, and a movie is much larger than a stage production ever could be.For the movie itself, this DVD was magnificent. ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is one of the best movies I've ever seen, with the stunning visuals and well-rounded cast of actors and actresses. As a DVD, the full-screen edition SUCKS, because, well, there are no extras! All you get is the theatrical trailer. Had I paid attention instead of just assuming that the Full-Screen DVD would have all the same extras as I'd seen advertised for the Special Edition Wide Screen version, I would have never bought this DVD. I was foaming at the mouth with excitement over getting home and watching the behind-the-scenes documentary, and instead all I got was the preview. Bluh.But if you don't care about extras and just want to see the movie, then BUY IT!! By all means, BUY THIS MOVIE. It's a wonderful adaptation of one of the most beautiful stories ever told on stage, and everyone should see it at least once.

As a phan of the original novel by Gaston Leroux, I had simply fallen in love with the cynical Meg Giry, and her dark countenance. When I saw the broadway show I was appalled.Music and Lyrics: GREATADAPTATION: HORRENDOUS.Meg was now some sissy blonde who was scared of everything and had no self-esteem! The antithesis of Leroux's Meg! I went to the movie expecting no different.But you know what? Jennifer Ellison completely redefined the role of Meg. Her previous roles and ballet skill were just what was needed for the role, and her acting gave Meg a more dignified, mysterious role. Plus it helps that Meg gets A LOT more scenes in the movie than in the musical, and plays a much bigger part.Emmy Rossum is an ACTUAL operatic SOPRANO (worked with the Metropolitan Opera), unlike Sarah Brightman, whose voice was too low for my tastes. Patrick Wilson is on my favorite Raouls list, right below Wishbone.Gerard Butler played a similar ""dark angel/stalker"" character in Dracula 2000 (the second thing I saw him in after Tomb Raider), so I knew he could act. And as for singing...Well, he's no Hugh Panaro. And Miranda Richardson was THE Madame Giry.Overall, I give this 3 stars, mostly for the casting of Ellison as Meg Giry, costume/set design, and musical adaptation.The two stars off were for faithfulness to Leroux (where IS that Persian?), something Andrew Lloyd Webber should have brought up during the making of the film at some point.If you're going to buy the DVD, buy the 2-disc version, because there are bonus interviews with the cast (cough) Ellison(cough) and looks behind the scenes at what was changed, what was added, and why. Reccomended for Leroux Meg phans!"	3.0	"Ellison shines as a more ""Leroux"" Meg"	2005-12-28	37	29	8

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2RS1ROQW3OG9Z	"Becca Taylor ""Becks"""	OK. First of all I would like to start by commenting on Gerard Butler's performance. It's true that he is not Michael Crawford, but he is still wonderful in the role. I know from reading the book, that the Phantom should be hideous and probably older, but I think that this version is just as good. Gerard Butler brings on a new, more modern twist on this character. People have mentioned that his voice and performance lack emotion, but i beg to differ. His voice, unlike Crawford's nasal one, brings plenty of power and emotion. It is also seductive and bewitching at the same time. His acting was not bad at all, in my opinion, in fact I think that he portrayed the Phantom perfectly. I have heard mentioned that Webber wanted a more rock sound to the Phantom's voice, and I feel that Butler brought that aspect to the film perfectly. He was very easy to identify with, and I found myself wanting to give him a hug and comfort him in his sorrow. I don't think that another actor could have done that.Emmy Rossum was wonderful as Christine Daae. People have complained that she is not Sarah Brightman, and to those people I say this: Christine Daae is supposed to be YOUNG and vulnerable and inexperienced in the ways of the world. Sarah Brightman is NOT young! Do you honestly believe that having older (much older) actors in the roles would be wise? But anyways, back to Emmy. I really enjoyed her performance. Yes, I too noticed that her mouth is hanging open through most of the movie, but she is basically in a sort of trance when the Phantom is near, and I think that if you consider that fact, then the mouth open-ness shouldn't be too much of a problem. She brought the naivety to the role, and did an excellent job. Her voice was beautiful, and she was wonderful with the high notes.Patrick Wilson did a good job as well. I am not much of a Raoul fan, but I think that he did a good job portraying the Vicomte. He reminded me of the prince from Beauty and Beast. His voice wasn't quite what I would have liked, but I think that he was perfect as Christine's childhood sweetheart.Many people have complained about Minnie Driver's Carlotta. She is supposed to be obnoxious, and over the top! I think that Driver was a perfect Carlotta, and brought some humour to the film.Overall I think that the film was fantastic! I have seen it seven times, and as soon as I buy it I am sure I will watch it even more. The music was fabulous, and ever since seeing it 'The Phantom of the Opera is there inside my mind...'.	5.0	This Movie Rocks!	2005-06-21	5	3	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A37IL8B2RL95PL	"Becky Hatfield ""book fire wolf"""	Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera is a must see movie, even if you don't like musicals, the music will steal your senses. Emmy Rossum shines as the talented Christine with a powerful soprano voice, Gerard Butler bewitches us with his rough voice as the Phantom, and Patrick Wilson beams as a love from Christine's past, Raoul. A must see movie for people of all ages, it takes place in the Paris opera house, Emmy(Christine), and Gerard(Phantom) take your breath away in beautiful scene's in the Music of the Night and in the The Point of No Return. Patrick(Raoul) will steal your heart when he bellows out in a handsome tenor voice in All I Ask of You. With other names such as Minnie Driver(Carlotta), who sings the final song Learn to Be Lonely, and other greats such as Ciaran Hines, this movie will bewitch the mind and steal the heart, and leave you with the question, if you were in Christine's place...who would you choose?	5.0	Inspiration or Love??	2005-12-01	2	2	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3PIYMIYKUKOG2	"Becky Sparks ""bekkers"""	I love the Phantom of the Opera; I have seen it twice on the stage (my husband actually saw it in New York in the 80s when Crawford was the Phantom).  I must also admit that I have never quite forgiven Joel Schumacher for what he did to Batman, but the film I saw this weekend finally made me let go of the old grudge.  It was beautiful, moving, and all the things that many other reviewers have already stated.  But a couple of points that have made in other reviews bothered me a little, and I wanted to respond a bit.I have found that a common complaint is that the Phantom was too sexy and too young - too close to Christine's age...  Well, Gerard Butler is 35 and Emmy Rossum is 18.  That seems a significant age diference to me; it makes him old enough to be her father and is enough to make him seem more than a little bit like a sexual predator.I saw an interview Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber, and one of the things they discussed is that part of what PotO is about is the juxtaposition of first innocent love and first sexual obsession.  Now certainly, the film brings that point into sharper focus by making the Phantom into a more sensual character, but it is not a new twist to the story.It has also been mentioned, with regards to the Phantom's youth and sensuality that Christine seems like an idiot for choosing Raoul.  Now, to be truthful, Christine is a bit fickle and at times a bit of a twit, but she is also a 16 year old girl, and in my experience, that is part of the definition of '16 year old girl'.  I can tell you without a doubt that if I were Christine I'd have jumped the Phantom in a second, but I'm a thirtysomething... not a teenager.  I believe that while a young woman would be drawn to the dark, mysterious Phantom, she would choose Raoul.The most common complaint I have found among viewers is with Gerard Butler's voice.  For a man who has never sung before and had no previous vocal training, he was fantastic.  Certainly, he was no Michael Crawford, Butler's voice is lower and his interpretation of the character is different.  But, in all honesty, the last thing I wanted to see in the film was an attempt by ANY of the actors to parrot any other actor's portrayal of a character.  Any actor, if he (or she) has talent at all, will do all he can to make a character his own.  I rather enjoyed Butler's nuanced portrayal.  His Phantom was very angry, with deep emotional scars, crying out in righteous fury at a cruel, heartless world.  I rather liked that the Phantom did not simply seem insane.  He was deeply wounded, emotionally and psychologically.  Perhaps Butler simply took the time to research what loneliness and severe emotional trauma would do to a person, and incorporated more humanity into a character that can easily be seen as no more than a caricature of humanity.It has also been mentioned that it is difficult to believe the Phantom truly loves Christine until the very end, but I always thought that was the point.  He was motivated by selfishness right up until the moment he gave her up - until that moment, one could actually argue that he didn't truly love her.Feel free to disagree with me as you like, but perhaps take just a moment to consider this different viewpoint.	5.0	Went in with low expectations, never so happy to be wrong!	2005-01-18	23	21	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A35K942UUIR9BY	"Bee ""Dreamer"""	Well, I do like musicals a lot. I didn't get to see this one on big screen so I rented the DVD instead. I'm giving it 3 stars [well maybe 3 1/2] just because I like the originally story but seriously quite a few things are wrong with this musical film.Okay, I'm not a music expert but I truly don't get it when a lot of reviewers here said the actors/ actresses voice was great. I have a set of Phantom CDs and even with my uneducated ears, I can tell you that what was sung in the film isn't even close. It's just mediocre.  Also, I once saw Phantom on a London's stage and even though it was years ago I still remember I got goosebumps all through my sitting. For this musical film, not even once I got that kind of feeling. That BAD!Another thing, what's with the leading actress? She's got a sweet face all right but she can't act and she has ZERO screen presence. I think if the singing is going to just passable like this, it would have been much better to use a famous actress, one whom you can't help but look at in awe and admiration.. at least the whole watching experience would be much more interesting. Both male actors are somewhat tepid too. Hmm..And on top of that, if you are going to make a bad imitation of a famous musical, why not give it your all like they did with Chicago. Who knows.. the flashy factors might have helped offset the weakness of this musical film.Well, to sum it up, I'm disappointed. Must be because I expected too much.PS: I still don't understand how it is possible for anyone who has seen a stage version of Phantom to give this quite bad musical film a five.	3.0	Disappointing	2005-05-14	14	5	9
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2GBHU4I14BVER	"BeetleJess ""Jess"""	I saw the play about a year before this movie came out, I saw the play and was blown away. I didn't really think the movie would be all that great. It wasn't nearly as amazing as the play, but it did stick to the play quite well and I assume that's why I liked it more. The two things that really bothered me, though, were the electric guitars at the end of 'The Phantom of the Opera' song, and the masquerade costumes, which weren't colorful and wild like the ones in the play. Overall, I'd say the movie is worth buying, but nothing beats the real thing.	4.0	The Phantom of the Opera	2005-02-22	5	2	3
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3QOYKLATVAOM6	"Belinda Vasquez Garcia ""writeaholic"""	Gerard Butler is a better singer than Michael Crawford. The movie rocks. Gerard Butler is better looking and a better actor than Michael Crawford. This is a great movie. I've seen Andrew Loyd Weber's Phantom of the Opera on Broadway and in Phoenix. This movie is better than the Broadway show, and I was shocked that Gerard Butler is better than Michael Crawford. The movie is better than seeing it on Broadway. They added to the story. And from the moment the movie begins in black and white at an auction at the ruined opera house and the cover is removed from the broken chandelier and as the chandelier is lit, the cobwebs are lifted one by one and the opera house is brought back to life in color in the past, the movie is awesome!Emmy Rossum's voice is every bit as good as the original Christine, the former Mrs. Andrew Loyd Weber. However, she plays Christine with more innocence and sexiness and without the cockiness of the Sarah Brightman.Everyone in the audience was absolutely quiet throughout the movie and seemed as mesmerized as I was. Everyone clapped at the end. The Phantom of the Opera is truly a great love story, and this movie version nearly does justice to the love story in the book. However, both the Broadway version and the movie is missing the part that the Phantom literally dies of a broken heart in the book.I loved the movie anyway.	5.0	Better than the Broadway Show	2005-01-02	5	4	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A44L1371VP728	Ben Klenke	"I must start this review by saying I am a ""Phan"". This is geek code for fans of the Phantom of the Opera. I 1st saw Phantom when I was in the 7th grade in Los Angeles. I later received the soundtrack on tape, and spent many many nights falling asleep to The Music of the Night. It is beautiful story set to gorgeous music.Let's get a few more things out of the way. I never believed that the Phantom role exists only in Michael Crawford. Gerard Butler does a smash up job as the masked man. What he lacks in vocal range he more than makes up in acting ability. He ain't to hard to look at either. Is there really any woman who could say no the Phantom after the Point of no Return sequence? Emmy Rossum was perfect as Christine. She especially embodied the innocence that Christine is made of.Let's talk changes:1. The chandelier falls at the end of Don Juan instead of at the end of All I ask of You. Verdict: A necessary change since the movie does not have an intermission. In the play it would not work. The film... Yes.2. The swordfight: the best change between the film and play. In the play the Phantom shoots a ""fireball""? from his staff at Raoul and Christine. The film changed this up with a rousing swordfight, that also greatly adds to Raoul's character development. I always felt we was way to wussified in the play and wondered why Christine even would want him in the 1st place. Verdict... Awesome3. The Phantom's origins: The play makes no mention of how the Phantom came to be in the Opera. We know that Madame Giry knows more than she should. The film goes into great detail of how The phantom was in a circus freak show and was rescued by Giry. It is not a necessary scene to the story, but does not detract from the flow, and does add more sympathy to the Phantom. Verdict... unnecessary, but not an issue.4. Raol and the water trap: In the play Raol makes his way to the Phantom's lair through the underground labyrinth with water. In the film he falls through a trap door into the water as a cage descends upon him. The only negative to this scene is it breaks the tension of the Phantom and Christine. Once again it no t needed but adds a bit more dramatic tension to Raol's character, even though everyone should know he'll get out somehow. It would have been impossible in the play. Verdict... same as above.This is a beautiful, fun filled, moving movie. The music has never sounded better, the staging is phenomenal, and the performances are dramatic and over the top, like any good musical should be. This is hands down the best movie musical since The Sound of Music. Cower Chicago and Moulin Rouge, the Phantom owns you all!*****/ A+"	5.0	It doesn't get better than this	2005-10-09	9	8	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A20EEWWSFMZ1PN	"bernie ""xyzzy"""	"The Paris Opera House is being sold to a couple of junk... oops scrap metal dealers. They inherit along with the opera and Opera Company but also an unwanted guest. Yes it is the Opera Ghost or Phantom.  The ghost falls in love with a voice and before the story of a love triangle is over we see that genius has turned to madness.Loosely base on a story written by Gaston Leroux in 1911 ""LE Fantme de l'Op&eacute;ra"" (with many improvements) and more than 10 movie adaptations, ""Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera"" is brought to film with only scenes and sights and full orchestral music at can only bee seen and heard on film (best in Blu-ray).As with many movie adoptions this film pails compared to the famous stage productions. Yet is much better than the stage version I watched locally. We also are treated of insights, which even though lack the mystery of stage, from flashbacks to carriage chase scenes.The costuming and sets are impeccable and spectacular. Of course even for the time Patrick Wilson could stand to have a haircut.Most of the actors, of course not the stage actors, were well chosen especially Minnie Driver as Carlotta. Emmy Rossum as Christine is cute as a button and could have been a Disney hereon. The only downside is that with all the choices of singers thy chose a lead Gerard Butler as The Phantom who is not a professional singer and you can hear it.Ignore the fact that you can hear Evita creeping in many of the tunes and prepare to be wrapped in the story.The Blu-ray DVD has a great back story of the Making of the Phantom that almost rivals the movie."	5.0	The closest we will come to the Play for many of us	2008-05-03	0	0	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A4I6GZB9ELXJH	"Bethany ""B"""	"It's the typical love triangle - the aggressive man of mystery with all the intelligence and tragic Gothic beauty in the world; the safe man who has a sweet deposition and a flair for the passionate sword fight and finally the woman who has a battle of lust/heat vs. true romance. Sounds like the typical Hollywood movie, doesn't it? Nevermind the easy cheap Hollywood setting, but subtract the weak love and add a beautifully suffocating feeling of possessed music, we have ""Phantom of the Opera,"" a noble and amazing book, play and now movie starring break-through singer/actors. Emmy Rossum (""Mystic River""), Gerard Butler (""Letters to Frankie"") and Patrick Wilson (""The Alamo"") star in the highly anticipated ""Andrew Lloyd Weber's The Phantom of the Opera"" a movie directed by Joel Schumacher and produced by Andrew Lloyd Weber with a supporting cast including Miranda Richardson (""The Hours"",)and Minnie Driver (""Good Will Hunting"").In the midst of amazing beauty in the backdrops and the costumes (note ""Mask of the Red Death"" - did the fashion designers take inspiration from the stage costume or actually did their homework?) which look astonishingly beautiful although there are some noticeable flaws that made it difficult for me to sit through.The main one to point out is the poor lip-syncing in the numbers ""Think of Me"" and ""Track Down this Murderer"" as well as through many of the numbers such as the title track were turned into little ""music videos"" using camera shots to (?) possibly to make or cover up the poor lip syncing issues. Some of the special scenes in the movie versus the stage play was un-needed, notably the sword fight. Call me a literature purist, but none of them had gone into a physical fight, for Leroux it was a mental struggle and vying for the love of one woman between two men.Again, Schumacher makes up for some of the poor moves and sweeps into the ""Masquerade"" song and dance a la ""Rodgers and Hammerstein"", which the dancing down the hall just screamed those two historical names when I first watched it. In that scene also, double props for the use of colour, and not only the black, white, and silver, but for Christine and Phantom who by ""The Music of the Night"" had been tainted by blood and therefore shades of red. Brilliant idea!All the scenes were wonderfully acted and sung. Butler, having no experience in the singing field only added to the standards that Crawford set as rather the ""rock and roll"" phantom with his growling voice (think ""What raging fire shall flood the soul"")while Rossum has the perfect voice to match the character (she has beaten out Brightman, but had generated Christine's signature poodle curly hair). It is amazing that the singing was fit for the characters. And it was surprising that Minnie Driver was all to brilliant for this role, even faking out with the opera singing voice.But another low point is showed, or perhaps with some more analysis one could figure the reasoning why Butler's makeup just looked like a bad rash. Would it be for him to have the new-age Phantom disfigurement (comparing with Lon Chaney, for example) to show yet another piece of satire in POTO? Like that society is so inept for just the tiniest detail of disfigurement to be ugly and therefore easily shunned?Another issue that is noticeable for a person who has seen POTO over and over again is the age issue. If Mme. Giry was about thirteen when she rescued the Phantom (supposedly sixteen according to Leroux), and then flash forward some years and Mme Giry is much older than the Phantom. Again, only a flaw that the ""young-Hollywood"" version could have only produced.Personally for this movie, I would have liked to have seen Baz Luhrmann or Rob Marshall take the helm of directing this movie, because at the end I felt a bit dry - as if this direction wasn't enough personally for me. But the look was beautiful and perhaps the only gaudy thing is made up in the settings and La Carlotta's acting and wardrobe.Like many people say of ""Fantome de l'Opera"" that it is a confusing book, ""Andrew Lloyd Weber's Phantom of the Opera"" is just as confusing when it is in black and white, as well was being Hollywood purified. All in all, looking away from the bones of the movie, ""Phantom of the Opera"" is another musical that we can hope to rejuvenate the forgotten genre.Now for the DVD setting: I was looking forward to getting the two disc Special Widescreen edition - instead, the extras were less than desired.The highs of the packaging are ""Behind the Mask: The Story of Phantom of the Opera"" - a featurette that I just adore - complete with interviews from POTO's stage orginators - Andrew Lloyd Weber, Charles Hart, Richard Stilgoe and Harold Prince to name a few - with scenes from the stage production and promo spots, showing the original cast.One thing in that featurette that nags at me is ALW's inconsideration to the play's origin to consider that ""Don Juan Triumphant"" was his idea to put into the play. However from reading Leroux, it was ""...on the desk was a music book covered with red notes. I asked leave to look at it and read 'Don Juan Triumphant'..."" (Leroux, 126).The other lows of the second disc was the dim and dumb idea of a sing a long of the crew to the title track and one deleted scene which is obvious why it was deleted - a re-lyric-ed version of Minnie Driver's ""Learn to Be Lonely"" as ""No One Would Listen"" sung by Gerard Butler. Yes, it has its good parts to have been taped, but at the same time, we had enough sympathy between Mme Giry and Christine, as well as the Phantom's self loathing, it wasn't needed for that one scene.One thing I was looking forward to seeing on the extras (or at least on the first disc) would be a cast/crew or individual commentaries on the movie. There is one thing that goes straight to my heart and that's featurettes and cast commentaries. They should make sure on its (if possible) future re-release to have some commentaries!The acceptable was the ""3-act"" featurette of the making of the movie.After seeing this movie, like Richard Stilgoe and Emmy Rossum, I would highly suggest planning on a pilgrimage to the Opera House in Paris!"	4.0	Flawed but beautiful ... like the Phantom himself	2005-07-27	2	1	1

Do not buy this looking for a duplication of the live theater. DO buy it for itself! Enjoy it as a stand alone great version of ALW's PTO. I may be able save thousands of dollars in future airfares, hotels & tickets now that I have this DVD. Rich sound and color. The movie seems somehow to be an even more intimate experience than the theater. I think it is the extreme closeups of the emotions on the faces. The young lady playing Christine has perhaps the best voice & delivery of all that I have heard.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A39MV4GP78QB4P	BJL411	Mostly of whom are men, it just goes to say why we women consider men in general to be a-holes.This movie is beautiful, the singing is excellent and riveting, the brilliance of Andrew Lloyd Webber, well what can be said? As for Gerard Butler, do they come any hotter? I think not.  He is brilliant in this performance and his 1 1/2 yrs spending on the singing portion of this movie shows his devotion to learning and preparing his voice and then doing what needed to be done. The young 18 yr old actress in the lead role is Emmy Rossum and holds her own with the likes of hot stuff Butler and always engaging Minnie Driver (who has a much smaller role but totally fits in this movie so well).I have not and will not buy this movie. I watched it on HBO, tivo'd it, and keep it for viewing in the future. I've probably watched it a dozen times and I pick up pieces here and there that I hadn't noticed before.Tell the guys to go to the sports bar and you ladies sit down cuddle up on the sofa under your afghan, candles lit, a hot cup of tea, turn your stereo speakers up and watch this movie!

If you are a musical lover, you will probably be disappointed-- even if you are a pop music lover, you will be also disappointed.For what we have here is singing basically in the way Julie Andrews's sang in The Sound of Music, but sung with a much flimsier voice far less musical ( or as another reviewer put it: ""wooden""). The singing does not sound like professional, whether as pop singer or classical singer: I have just revisited Miss Saigon where the singing have much in common and I must say the singing in Miss Saigon is so much better! Yet, there is singing all the time, almost from the beginning till the end...The way the story unfolds reminds me of ""Titanic"" but not quite as absorbing, and ""shallow"" was the word the Editorial Review used even though that could be an overstatement. Yet, the screen is always crowded in both the foreground and background. Worse of all, the film was seen through the Phantom's eyes, sapping much the sense of suspense and mystery. To make it up,  there are scenes of unnecessary violence unsuitable for small children...I wouldn't recommend it to those who love the two older versions or its variation ""The Red Shoes""-- for those who had not seen them could check them out themselves. And I'm afraid even those who took delight in the original musical (sung by Brightman) would find this one disappointing or even boring. Having said that, this is not too bad a film as a time-killer but certainly nowhere near the one the enormous publicity would like to project. To be avoided by those who have fine tuned their ears to classical music: it is quite an ordeal!"	2.0	As a  Musical ...	2005-01-11	15	2	13

It has been a long time since I enjoyed a movie so much.Gerard Butler is the Phantom! He gives the character such a compelling personality that he draws you in and makes you feel his pain. He is incredibly handsome, moves with grace and brings a sensual quality to the phantom. His voice is very masculine and full of passion which suits the character of the Phantom. Emmy Rossum is beautiful as Christine and her sweet clear voice is wonderful.Buy this movie and the soundtrack so you can enjoy it again and again!	5.0	THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA	2007-12-02	1	1	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1PDH0RT67G1BS	"B. McFarland ""GerrysJewel"""	"I was in highschool when the musical debuted with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman in 1986. I have been familiar with Weber's music and the voices tied to the characters that became an overnight phenomenon world wide.However, I did not have an opportunity to see the stage show (until just this year) so was delighted when they had made a movie of it. Thank you, Joel Schumacker! The movie tied the music and the story line together and I have been hooked since. So it was for obvious reasons why I purchased the movie soundtrack as well as the movie DVD.I am amazed and a little dismayed over the reaction Gerard Butler received as the movie Phantom. I knew nothing of this actor prior to this film. After seeing the movie, I was in love with this man and had to learn who he was and anything else about him. Off to the internet I went in search of this actor who made such an impression on me. I learned that Gerry (as he likes to be called) was not a stage-trained vocalist before he took on this role. Now, some people say that was obvious as they did not like his vocals. Many fans are true to the original London cast. And that's OK. But does that mean you cannot be open minded and realistic enough to know that Michael Crawford is not and will not be the only man to ever portray our beloved Phantom?It would have been disastrous to have Mr. Crawford portray the Phantom for the movie. It would have been even more disastrous if Sarah Brightman played Christine. The point is these 2 beloved people are past the age where they can realistically play these young roles. It was much more realistic to have younger fresh actors. Christine was only 16 years old in the original novel. The Phantom was in his very early forties. The actors chosen were spot on age wise. Emmy Rossum was 16 when she signed on. She also trained at the Metropolitan Opera at the age of 7. Gerard Butler was 34. A tad younger, but it didn't really matter yet it was more acceptable that a 34 year old recluse would be sexually attracted to a 16 year old budding diva and vice versa.I am a trained singer. I have sung in the finest concert halls of Europe. I have heard many, many trained vocalists. BUT NONE OF THEM DO TO ME WHAT GERARD BUTLER'S VOICE DOES TO ME. It doesn't bother me at all that he is not a classically trained vocalist. In fact, after finding out that he wasn't trained when he took on this challenge, made me admire him even more. While I was listening to POTO for the first time, you couldn't tell me that he wasn't trained. I knew his vocals were much different than Michael Crawford's, but I felt his voice fit the role for the film. Gerard has a deeper, richer, fuller voice that is sexy as heck and a voice that I now prefer over Mr. Crawford's tinnier, higher tenor.Gerard's raw passionate performance knocked me off my feet. I fell in love with Gerry after watching Phantom because of the way he moved me so. His voice is so seductive and rich and sexy and captivating. His ""Music of the Night"" leaves me breathless. His ""Point of No Return"" seduces the heck out of me (and the entire female population). His sad, pleading ""All I Ask of You"" before Christine rips his mask off during ""Don Juan Triumphant"" is heartbreaking. Heartwrenching, growling ""Down Once More"" has me crying for his pain. He grips me in the core of my womanhood and won't let go. In this way I feel like I am Christine....drawn to the hypnotic power of his voice and the raw sensuality that draws me to him. I can't explain it, I can only FEEL it. And I can't get enough of him.Emmy Rossum's Christine was a standout, breakout performance. This young lady CAN SING! Her voice is so clear and vibrant and sexy and she possess an incredible range. And she's beautiful to boot. This gal has a future in music and movies. I would keep an eye on this one!I also feel Patrick Wilson's Raoul was fresh and much more developed than the stage version. He becomes the swashbuckling hero, and lover trying to protect his Christine from a murdering lunatic. Patrick's voice is just angelic and beautiful, but he lacks the passion that Gerard seems to have in spades.Although Minnie Driver did not sing her own vocals, her performance was without a doubt brilliant as La Carlotta. She sings the ending title song ""Learn to Be Lonely"". She does a beautiful job.Miranda Richardson's Madame Giry was classy and elegant, and more developed as a character who knew more than she was telling as opposed to the stick-thumping 'evil step-mother' portrayal on stage.The orchestrations are slightly different than the musical but all in all, it is the same music we all fell in love with back in 1986. The orchestrations are fuller with 110 piece orchestra, 90 voice choir and an added guitar that gives this familiar music a fresh rock n roll edge, but not enough to take away from the classic orchestrations we all love.I truly admire and LOVE ALL the performances of the movie. The sets and costumes are lavish and stunning.Gerard, while not a trained singer, put his entire heart and soul into this role and rose to the challenge and did the best job anybody could have hoped to do. That to me, no matter what the critics say, impresses and amazes me the most and Gerard deserves the credit of a job exceptionally well done.If you are a fan of Weber's musical - you need to see this movie!"	4.0	Beloved Musical Comes to the Big Screen	2008-08-09	3	2	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2ATWKOFJXRRR1	"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com"""	Bad, bad, bad. That was the repetitive word marching through my thoughts as I watched this horror-of-a-movie. First let me say that I will normally watch a terrible film to its end just so that I can brag about watching it (sorta like when I was a kid and someone dared me to swallow a live worm. I did it so I could say I was brave). But having grown up I now know the difference between bravery and stupidity. Show me a worm now and I'll at least fry it up before making it a tasty treat (just kidding!).But seriously, this film just doesn't hold together when compared against the stage-play version. Most notably is the overly attractive cast, including THE PHANTOM! I mean, this guy is supposed to be disfigured, right? But here he's a hunk. Come on! And the lip synching was horrifically obvious. The modernization of the music was terribly forced, too...And I noticed all of these...things...less than 45 minutes into the film, which is when I finally (mercifully) ended my suffering by turning it off.I breathed a sigh of relief and went into the kitchen to look for a can of worms to eat.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A37BNMAR9GROAX	Bob Vance	Seeing the Broadway for the second time only a short time after seeing the movie in the theater I can say the movie and the stage production have their differences. The avid theater musical lover will be distracted by the performance of the phantom. His vocal musical quality leaves something to be desired. Also be prepared for a few changed and all together new scenes including a sword fight. The acting and cinemitography are compelling and amazing. Very impressive and simple to fallow in comparison of the stage production which can leave you lost at times. The interpretation and transition for the character of the phantom from a charming luring individual to pure insanity is a bit of a change for me.

In my opinion, the beautiful scenes, the sensual beauty of the actors, the music score, make this almost a perfect movie.The visual opportunities that a movie can create as opposed to a stage play has its own wonderful merits.I had to view this movie as a separate creation and try not to compare, but to enjoy and emerse myself in the lusciousness of this production.Gerard Butler is sexy, sensual and has a genuine sensitivity in his roles such as the Phantom. Also, he's a very MANLY hunk and he sure can sing! (whew!... is it hot in here)? I'd really like to see him act in more roles, and musicals in the future.Actually, all of the cast were wonderful, all with beautiful voices.Even though Minnie Driver may have been dubbed for singing I still think she was absolutely delightful in her Diva role.

A visual feast for the eyes--costumes, sets, cinematography, and particularly the cast.  Emmy Rossum is a lovely child with a potentially wonderful voice who plays her part with wide-eyed innocence, which is as it should be.  Patrick Wilson as Raoul is sweet and charming.  However, Gerard Butler is the sexiest damnned ghost I've ever beheld!  Even with the mask off, his is the character that begs sympathy and understanding for all those who go through life looking ""different"" from people around them.  As far as the singing skills of the cast, I had a difficult time not comparing them to the original London stage production cast, particularly Sarah Brightman (her voice so rich, full, and clear) and Michael Crawford (strong, deep, and resonant)--just goes to prove there is little to improve on age and experience.  However, the actors in this lushly done film do a fine job with a long score and they as well as the production staff are to be commended for even attempting to make a movie of this beloved play."	5.0	Lovely to Look At	2005-04-26	9	5	4

My parents went to Ontario at the Pantages Theatre to watch the play. So, naturally, when the movie version came out in 2004, there was no doubt that it would be seen by my family.The Phantom of the Opera, there, became real to me - not on stage, but in a movie theater. So much more I began to understand, and I found myself falling head over heals. (Who wouldn't? This is Gerard Butler, after all...)This movie remains my favorite film of all time.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2CJRAZ5JCSTZC	BPNoble	I got my copy of Phantom of the Opera yesterday.  I was lucky enough to see it when it first hit Chicago years ago, and adored the music, the sets, everything.  So, I was prepared to enjoy a different version.  I'm not quite sure why it got so many lukewarm or cold reviews.  The settings are far more complicated than they were on stage (duh!  More room, more money, etc.), and I really loved the minimalist stage dressing.  The stage version was darkly lit (boy, is that an oxymoron!), with little fairy lights, whereas the movie version used fire and other light to turn everything bright.  They portrayed the Phantom's (whom I always call by his given name, which was revealed in one of the non-musical film versions) interior darkness by associating red with him, and not using in many scenes for anything else.  The film used a rather limited color palette -black, white, gold, red, with splashes of other colors.  The tunnels were all gray with torches providing the illumination and green water.  Very cool.The singing was ... not quite up to Broadway/Opera.  The man playing Eric was very good, but the hero was so-so.  Christine's voice was very modern, wispy, almost ethereal, quite like many women who sing Celtic music, not really up to the operatic potential of Lloyd Weber's music, but it worked.  There were several new songs, which were welcome, since my memory of the stage version was that it had one melody used over and over.  The whole film felt much more operatic than it did on stage.  Minimal talking.  They minimized Eric's deformities by giving him mild neurofibromatosis -He actually looked pretty decent, and I think that it would be possible for him to go outside without too many stares and comments, certainly less than poor Richard Merrick had to endure.  They also created a backstory to show how his psyche had been broken as a child, making him all the more pitiable.All in all, a really good movie, no matter what the professional critics had to say.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ABP4IP6UJR9LD	"Brenda Burks ""jbaddicted"""	I could not wait to get this DVD and when I finally did get it, I was really amazed that Jerry could sing so well.  Some may think he didn't do such a good job but I am a fan of everything he does.  It was a great love story with so much hurt and loneliness.  I felt such pain for the Phantom.  Jerry did such a wonderful job behind the mask he had to wear because his part required his character to show emotion thru his eyes and his voice thru his songs . It was wonderful.  I suggest this DVD to all and especially to those hard-core Jerry Butler fans.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A34L2ZYZTOA9JQ	Brenton Mcintosh	"I have to say I loved the film, and understand the decision to make the three main characters younger than they were in the original stange production (having a 30 something Christine would simply not feel right when you think of how innocent and naive her character is) the Phantom is just a bit too hunky for my tastes. He looks like .grind in a g-string.Gerald Butler acts and sings the role well, but he's made to look like he's just stepped off the cover of a romance novel, all open shirts and smoking sexuality (I just can't see the phantom doing sit ups). Even the makeup has been cut back to the point that he's just not that ugly, I could actually have seen half the women in the audience saying to themselves ""Yeah, so he's killed a bunch of people and stalked he for years, I'd still have him"".Apparently when they were filming the ball sequence an 85 year old lady who had worked on one of the previous Phantom films visited the set, when she saw Butler in full Phantom costume she said ""Ohh, I'd drop my knickers for him""... scary, but for all the wrong reasons."	4.0	Should the Phantom be so hot looking?	2005-12-29	7	6	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1IBF4KNU6UU4A	brett c. pinkerton	Fans of the Broadway musical should enjoy this film adaptation by Joel Schumacher.  This re-imagining of the classic story pays homage to all of the beautiful songs written/composed by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyricist Charles Hart.  Even though the original cast of the Broadway show aren't included in this version, the viewer will find satisfaction in the performers (Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, Miranda Richardson, Minnie Driver, and Patrick Wilson) that are featured here.  While most of the award-winning songs such as Music of the Night, All I Ask of You, Phantom of the Opera, Angel of Music, Point of No Return, Think of Me, etc. are very much included, the Broadway viewer may find a little disappointment in the re-written parts of the screenplay.  While in the show most of the story is sung through, this version cuts out a lot of the sung-through dialogue and replaces it with re-written lines.  While some of the show may be lost there, overall the film still shines as a classic even after its first release in 2004.  This is a must-have for any fan of the Great White Way or the musical!	5.0	Perfect Adaptation	2013-07-15	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AAJTZPX7HDE5U	Brian J Hay	"""Phantom"" always had all the ingredients in place to become a good film. Action scenes can (and invariably are-sorry, but singers are usually lousy stuntmen) be done better on film than on live stage. The duel between Raoul and the Phantom is a good example of that. It's as good as many of the best duel sequences ever filmed. Special Effects benefit as well. The special effects it used for the stage productions were the best that could be done in a live performance. The film medium offers numerous opportunities to do more while still working in the service of the narrative though. Joel Schumacher takes those opportunities and uses them tastefully. The sequence where Raoul encounters the Phantom in the hall of mirrors is done very well. The scene where Christine sings ""Wishing You Were Here Again"" is one of the crowning moments of the film.Problems that plagued the stage production still exist in the film though. Not all of the music is great. The duet between the two managers (Simon Callow and Victor McGuire) seemed so much like something Gilbert and Sullivan would have written that one of them should have announced that he was a ""Modern Major-General"". Combining musical dialogue with the spoken word is a risky proposition at best and the stage production didn't always manage to do it spotlessly. The film doesn't either. The ""method"" used to provide Christine with a chance to sing is perfect. The transition between rehearsal singing and doing so with full orchestral backing is flawless. Watching Raoul charge down a flight of stairs in full voice knocks the scene on its ear. There are other instances where people seem to be singing when they should be speaking (or vice versa) as well. The build-up to ""All I Ask of You"" seems like music that's missing part of its arrangement.These are minor complaints alongside the film as a whole though. Some of the music is among the most appealing to come out of the last century. As a composer Webber's been accused of being overblown and excessive but the fact remains that his work touches hearts very deeply and keeps doing so. His critics may just be jealous. The sets, lighting and photography are fabulous. The story moves along briskly and there are some moments of genuine suspense, no small feat considering that most people who will see this film already know the outcome. The most poignant moments will touch the feelings of all but the most heartless (everyone else will be pausing to dry their eyes). The performances are generally very good.Patrick Wilson doesn't really make much of an impression as Raoul but that's probably because the character was never really given much depth to begin with. Minnie Driver gets most the laughs with her over-the-top performance as (what has to be) the most vain Prima Donna in history. What she doesn't wring from viewers Simon Callow and Victor McGuire (Andre and Piangi) will. Miranda Richardson is wonderfully understated as Madame Giry, the woman who holds the secret of the Phantom. Gerard Butler's voice seems a little harsh at times (especially when he barks out a note instead of singing it) but he plays the part of the tormented Phantom magnificently. His rage is fearsome and his ruthlessness chilling but the beauty enshrouded in his torment is a thing of wonder. Anyone who's ever felt any sense of loneliness at any time will identify with this character.Webber wrote all of the best music from this show for Sarah Brightman (including ""The Music of the Night""-anyone who doesn't believe that should listen to her sing it) and it's a bond she still cherishes. She intertwines with this music as if it was a lover, bathes it with her heart and passion and releases it with a huge part of herself inside whenever she performs it. Everyone involved, audience and orchestra alike, end up in the web. It's impossible to hear her do it and not be moved. Webber knew all of this when he picked Emmy Rossum for the role and he proved that his eye for talent is as sharp as it ever was. The girl is a marvel. She has a lovely voice, one that sounds frail and delicate but has a surprising amount of strength. Her interpretation of the music is her own, and it's valid on its own. She doesn't try to replace Brightman. That would be impossible anyway. What she's done is taken a torch passed to her by Webber and found her own way of carrying it.This is a very good film. But that was a given even before the completion of the project. Webber was on hand as a producer and he's nearly as strong in that area as he is as a composer. He wouldn't knowingly let his greatest triumph go to seed. It would have been a surprise if the film had turned out to be a dog."	5.0	A Triumph, especially for Emmy Rossum	2005-05-09	4	3	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	"Nominated for 3 Academy Awards and 3 Golden Globes, including Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, The Phantom Of The Opera is one of the most talked about movies of 2004. Taking the smash commercial success of Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage production to the big screen is no easy task, but long-time Hollywood director Joel Schumacher is more than able to get the job done. He takes an otherwise poorly written screenplay (minus the awe of a live performance no less) and manages to thrill the audience with the visual aspects of a film chiefly intended to rehash a successful stage musical. The costumes and set are simply magnificent, and Art Director John Fenner (Raiders Of The Lost Ark) helps Schumacher put together a fabulous production that's well worth a movie-goer's time...The Phantom Of The Opera centers around a mysterious character who dwells underneath the Paris Opera House, imbibing himself on the music that emanates from above. Known as The Phantom (Gerard Butler), he wears a half-mask to cover the hideous facial scars that have plagued him since birth. A musical genius, the phantom is infatuated with the opera, and when he falls in love with the voice of a young chorus girl named Christine (Emmy Rossum - The Day After Tomorrow (2004), Mystic River (2003)), this love of the opera morphs into an outright obsession. The phantom provides Christine with one-on-one voice lessons, while during his spare time, he terrorizes the opera house in an effort to land his prot&eacute;g&eacute; the opera's leading role. When Christine finally rises to that position, however, she is reunited with childhood friend Raul (Patrick Wilson), and the two begin a torrid love affair. Vengeful and jealous, the phantom kidnaps Christine and holds her prisoner in his underground lair, and Raul is the only one who can save her...Onscreen, The Phantom Of The Opera is weak by the standards of a traditional film. The cast does its best to make the most of a screenplay peppered with rigid dialogue - a script designed to sell ""the music of the night"". The supposed magnetism between Christine and Raul is non-existent and not really believable. As such, the audience is forced into believing that the phantom (who, by contrast, is quite charismatic in this rendition) would end up playing second fiddle to a man who makes Al Gore seem animated. Overall, however, other aspects of the film make up for this flaw...Based on Gaston Leroux's 1925 novel of the same name, The Phantom Of The Opera loses much of its original edge given the phantom's transformation from a frightening and mangled lunatic to a watered down half-scarred/half-babe-magnet figure complete with likeable characteristics. But inevitably, that's the mark of an enduring franchise - its malleability in the realm of numerous genres and the public's willingness to embrace such changes. But arguably, the small changes in the original novel's plot were necessary to achieve Lloyd Webber's goal of a melodramatic and stirring Broadway musical boasting mass commercial appeal. In a year in which the Oscar nominations were mostly dominated by lower-budget, surprise hit films (such as Sideways, Million Dollar Baby, and Finding Neverland), The Phantom Of The Opera holds its own in many aspects (given its pre-production designation as a commercial success). But those who have not seen the stage version are unlikely to be won over to the ranks of the franchise's numerous fanatics. My advice is to definitely see the film if you've ever seen the stage performance or listened regularly to the soundtrack - otherwise, you might be disappointed. After all, no matter how good The Phantom Of The Opera translates to the big screen, there's a reason musicals are not the dominate genre in Hollywood...The DVD Report"	4.0	5 stars if you love the stage musical...	2005-07-19	3	1	2

It is a beautiful story, with beautiful music and beautiful actors who capture compassion, tragedy, romance and desperation all in one film.  I also think it is noteworthy that there are parts from the book in the movie that were not in the play.  This shows that the writers took consideration in making this film, which is rare, and a welcome addition.

And don't even get me started on Emmy because throughout the whole movie I was just trying to figure out how they curled her hair:) she, unlike Gerard who had no previous vocal experience, was trained to play Christine since a young girl.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ABH4G7TVI6G2T	Byron Kolln	"Joel Schumacher's film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a perfect testemant to what has become the most successful stage production of all time.  Though many people are still wondering why the film wasn't made with it's original stage leads Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, the energetic young cast featured add their own magic to the gothic love story.The story is well-known and I won't go into a blow-by-blow account.  Young diva Christine is mysteriously tutored by someone she believes is her `Angel of Music'.  In reality it is the feared Erik, phantom of the Paris Opera.  Complications arise when Christine is reunited with her childhood sweetheart Raoul.  Erik, too, becomes infatuated with his young pupil.  As passions rise, Christine and Raoul are dragged to the brink of destruction as Erik vows to make Christine his bride...Gerard Butler is a fine Phantom, especially adept at making the role very human and vulnerable, yet also menacing and violent when the situation calls for it.  His singing voice is acceptable (""Music of the Night"", the Phantom's aria, is sailed through with little trouble).  On the whole his performance is quite excellent.Emmy Rossum might very well be the real discovery in this movie.  Little more than a teenager when she made her auspicious debut here as Christine, Miss Rossum is the innocent heart of the story.  A trained New York opera singer since childhood, Emmy Rossum sings Christine's intense and often very difficult arias to perfection.  ""Think of Me"", ""All I Ask of You"" and in particular her heart-wrenching ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" .  On stage the role of Christine is usually shared by two performers who alternate the 8 performance-week between them,  so demanding is the role of Christine.  Rossum could not have picked a more challenging role to make her big debut, but emerges triumphant.Patrick Wilson, a veteran of Broadway musicals, is perfectly-cast as Raoul.  The role has been somewhat re-written here as a more swashbuckling physical adversary to the Phantom.  He also has a fantastic singing voice as you would expect from his stage pedigree.  Minnie Driver is a hilarious delight as Carlotta, the resident diva of the Opera Populaire who is pushed from her perch to make way for up-and-comer Christine.  Driver's singing is of course dubbed (by Margaret Preece, who has played Carlotta onstage).  Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow play the Opera's bewildered and guileless managers Andre and Firmin to perfection.  Miranda Richardson adds untold depths to the role of mysterious ballet mistress Madame Giry.  In the play her connection with the Phantom is merely alluded to, but here the full story of Giry and the Phantom is revealed.  Jennifer Ellison plays Giry's daughter Meg with verve and spirit.Lloyd Webber has added a new number ""Learn to Be Lonely"" which plays over the end credits, sung by Minnie Driver in her own interesting singing voice.  The movie won't displace the stage production in the eyes of it's myriad fans (it was never meant to), rather they  stand side-by-side, for one cannot exist without the other.The film version of PHANTOM has been a long time coming ... but worth the wait."	5.0	sparkling screen incarnation of Lloyd Webber's PHANTOM	2005-04-20	15	9	6

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A10AGFN93JCNHQ	California Girl - LMD	"I can't get enough of this movie. I'd never seen Gerard Butler before, but since seeing him in this wonderful movie, no doubt, I'll never forget him.  The same goes for Emmy Rossum, who plays Christine. She's not only pretty, but is blessed (due to a lot of hard work, as well as a gift) with a beautiful voice. One thing that puzzled me throughout the movie was her tendency to ""whisper"" so often. Even when there were only two people in a room . . . she was whispering. It wasn't obvious that the other characters were doing the same in her presence. I don't know what I would do without 'closed captions'-- I guess I wouldn't be able to hear her. In contrast, when she sings, she sings loudly. I wonder if she does the same thing in other movies she's been in. Is this characteristic of her or was this just a case of poor directing?I'm aware that many people criticize Gerard Butler's signing voice. They obviously haven't paid attention to the fact that the Phantom was NOT supposed to have a ""beautiful"" signing voice; that's the part Emmy was supposed to fill, according to the story. The Phantom wrote the songs and operas, and she was his VOICE. According to that, they both did what they were supposed to do, and were who they were supposed to be.  Personally, I liked his voice; and as I stated, Emmy has a beautiful voice.In addition to the excellent Andrew Lloyd Webber music, the clever use of black and white segments in the movie contrasted with the color portions, I appreciated the superb acting all cast members. Most of all, my attraction to the movie is the intensity of the possessive love the Phantom has for Christine. When he takes her in his arms, it leaves me with an enviable secure feeling. He shows a strength with that embrace, one most females remember experiencing in their lives, or would like to.I see this movie every chance I get and relive the aura of this powerful movie over and over without tiring of it.I think rather than to be criticized at all, the movie and its cast members are to be praised for a job well-done."	5.0	A visual and audible experience!	2007-02-13	4	4	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1ZURD82EKBM9W	California lady	I'm going to see it tomorrow for the 8th and last time as it is leaving the theater in my area.  After seeing the Phantom, I immediately bought the sound track.  I agree with the reviewer who said that Gerard Butler's voice is more sensual and manly and really fits the part of the phantom.  His voice shows an entire array of emotions.  Michael Crawford has a very refined voice, but I too think it is too high.  I fell in love with this movie.  I get lost in the music..and I always cry at the end..it's so tragic.  Emmy Rossum is wonderful, and Patrick Wilson is a perfect Raoul.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A30FSM15SSZGE9	Cameron Brock	I know that I'm EXTREMELY late to the party, but here it goesSo, at my university, I'm in an American Popular Music class, and we just recently finished going over American musical theatre.  Naturally, one of the composers we highlighted was Andrew Lloyd Webber.  Now, I'd heard about The Phantom of the Opera, but had never given much thought to the talk passed around about it.  However, because of this particular class and the music clips we listened to from the musical, I simply had to check it out.And I was amazed.I found the 25th Anniversary performance at the Royal Albert Hall on Netflix and watched it voraciously.  Now completely obsessed, I rented this movie from Amazon, and while there are key differences between the stage production and this one, I loved it regardless.  Some people complain that the amount of singing outweighing the amount of dialogue is disconcerting, but I have to politely disagree.  It is because of the music that I am obsessed.  Now, not a day goes by that I don't listen to some of the music or find myself humming the melody to &#34;Music of the Night.&#34;In a word:  breathtaking.	5.0	Absolutely in awe.	2014-02-03	0	0	0

I am a big fan of the play and of the book that it was based on. I think that this movie did an exellent job of incorperating both. Contrary to many, I happen to believe that the movie was well casted (and i work in the movie business...so i am right and you who critisize are ignorent!). Emmy Rossum is an awesome singer; almost as good as Sarah Brightman but not quite. However, it seems that some of the 'magic' inherent in the play was missing in the film. In the play, it seemed as if the Phantom had some sort of magic surrounding him; like when the Punjab Lasso floats in the air hanging Raoul. In the movie he just runs over and ties him up. Come on, Hollywood! Special FX are your friend...this is why we have CGI! Anyway, i digress... READ THE BOOK... SEE THE PLAY...

Casting Gerard Butler as the phantom was pure brilliance.  He is young, handsome and oozes sensuality.  I almost caught fire watching the way he touched Christine. So much longing and passion.  All he had to do was touch her face with his fingertips and that emotion blazes forth.He stole the show with his presence and cast everyone else into the shadows. (A big sigh from me.)  &lt;G>Others might write negative comments regarding his singing but it was perfect.  Yes, he is no Michael Crawford but his vocal range fit this movie.  Every emotion he felt, the longing, desperation, love & fury was in that voice.I only wish that the story would have ended happily for the phantom.  I think it is long over due.  Yet, as I left the theatre I believed that Christine really did love the phantom.  When in his presence, she was powerless to resist him.  The darkness within him, the sensual promise he exuded frightened yet drew her like a moth to a flame.  She knew that he would not be content until he possessed her mind, heart and soul.  Everything would belong to him. She knew what to expect from Raoul.  He was much safer.  Still, Christine was a fool to pass up such passion.	5.0	Sexy Phantom = Excellent movie!	2005-02-07	11	10	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1R755QY4PX0LP	Carya	"The overture begins and your breath catches in your throat as you watch in awe the opera house come to life.The Phantom of the Opera is the classic gothic romance story of a young and aspiring singer Christing who is aided to become the next Prima Donna at the Paris Opera house by the mysterious Phantom.  However, Christine believes that it is the Angel of Music tutoring her, the angel that her father promised to send her when he died.  Christine enjoys her success after a night's performance of ""Think of Me"" and is reunited with a childhood friend who is now the young and dashing Viscount Raoul.Old romance flares and new jealousy arises.  Intent on keeping Christine for him self, the Phantom wisks her away through the mirror and into his lair.  There, Christine finds out who has really been tutoring her and she isn't exactly thrilled.Being afraid of the monster(though I would hardly call GB's Phantom a monster) below and his control over her, she plans to run away with Raoul who is more than happy to comply.  However, Phantom foils their plan through an Opera that he's written specifically for Christine, the famous ""Past the Point of no Return"" in Don Juan Triumphant.  At the end of the song, he confesses to her and they both fall through a trap back down to the underground.  There, he forces her to accept his proposal while poor Raoul, who tried to rescue her but failed, was forced to watch while tied to the gate and a noose around his neck.Christine, not having any choice, accepts.  And Phantom, finally being accepted, lets her go with Raoul.  The End.That's about how the story goes.  However, Raoul isn't exactly all that dashing in the book.  He's rather shy and timid.  And Phantom, aka Erik, is way more deformed and somewhat older.  Emmy does a wonderful job of singing and so does everyone else.  In case you weren't aware of it, everyone besides Minnie Driver really sang in the movie.  The music, of course, is amazing and breathtaking at times.  Webber did a great job once again.  The visuals are very believable, although that fog in the cemetary is a bit scetchy.Also, along with all the other goofs:-this is something that really bugs me, don't know why but it does: when Christine takes off Phantom's mask for the first time, his hair is perfectly normal, sleeked back and black.  His face looks normal too, actually.  When she takes his mask off in the ""point of no return"", his hair suddenly turn white, dishoveled, and there are quite a few chunks of it missing-Before Christine passes through the mirror, she has no make up on whatsoever, but when she wakes up in the Phantom's lair, the shadow around her eyes is quite noticable-When Christine leaves the Opera house to visit the cemetery, she is wearing a white nightgown, when she arrives at the cemetary, she is wearing a black dress with a trailer.  I tried to make this one out because you'll notice that she takes a black cape off of a hook before she buys the roses, so I though that must be it, but in the cemetery scene, no trace of white is visible.Overall, the movie was great, the Phantom was gorgeous, the music was stunning, and the acting was good.If you still haven't been aquainted with this musical, I highly recommend it, if not for the people or the movie, then for the music."	5.0	Stunning!!	2006-01-04	4	3	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A20BIPRPD473RD	Caryn Landy	Although I also enjoyed the 25th year Albert Hall film of the play, the Gerard Butler/Emmy Rossum film version of the story is my particular favorite. Both are worth seeing. The highlights of the play version are extraordinary scene craft and music and the 'live' performance aspects. However the film version offers more of the backstory and provides a rich historical aspect that, for me, is equally compelling and more satisfying. The characters seem more alive, more real. And the masqued ball scene is truly spectacular. The music, of course, is amazing. But the biggest surprise and a major delight is the Butler/Rossum chemistry. His vocal phrasing and timing, the delicate purity and strength of her voice; they are well matched in this and truly make the story come alive. I never tire of watching it; it never feels corny or old. The extraordinary lyrics and music as interpreted in this sensitive and well-directed film will be a classic for all time.	5.0	Best film version!	2013-07-29	0	0	0

But I was disappointed!Number one this movie was not what I expected it to be--as in repeating songs and repeating the same story line over and over just didn't work for this movie.I do love the music but over and over there were plenty of songs to chose from.Number two the movie was so freaking long.  I was not prepared for such a long movie.  Really the play is only two hours but they pulled out an extra 20 minutes.I did like the set and clothing it was something to keep my attention.  I also thought some of the characters were a bit over-rated (they didn't fit into the parts they were casted).With all of my bad mouthing the movie.  The people I went with loved it!  They thought I was crazy and so did the 100+ people that were in the theater at the same time as me.  It was actually sold out at 1:00 in the afternoon.  I have never been to an afternoon show that was sold out.  On the other-hand my friend and I were talking today and her and her mom went to see it and also disliked it.  I think it is all about a personal opinion.  So you will need to decide this one on your own.	3.0	Phantom or not....	2005-01-06	4	0	4

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1G013QINZG9Y1	C. Avery	"If you don't have the sophistication to enjoy Andrew Lloyd Webber's amazing musical masterpiece or if you are so pretentious that you have to over-analyze every note sung by the cast, or if you are expecting to hear filthy language, see gratuitous sex or gory violence, then this film is not for you and don't bother to review it.  If you are willing to open up your mind and take it for what it is - a classic tale of love and betrayal with a gothic influence, than you won't be disappointed.Yes it's kitchy in parts, but that's part of its nuance and makes it more interesting. Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler are not Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford in their singing abilities, but they can carry a tune (and very well- I love the movie soundtrack CD) and they have the on-screen chemistry that is required to hold a movie audiences' attention.I saw this movie 5 times in the theater and I can't decide if I kept going back because of the breathtakingly beautiful music, the powerful love story between Christine and The Phantom (Erik as he is called in the book), or because I am so intrigued by Butler and his performance. (And his looks may I add.) This man can display more emotion with just his eyes and has more acting ability with half his face hidden behind a mask, than most Hollywood actors of today can perform with their entire bodies.  He's truly remarkable and unfortunately under-rated at this point. So what that he's a ""young and good looking"" Phantom, as some people criticize?  That fact certainly held a lot of appeal for me.  It's because he's so young and attractive that he's a credible love interest for Christine and why I felt the movie was even more tragic in the end than the stage production.I notice that the DVD is the number 1 top seller here at Amazon this week.  The public truly appreciates a good film when they see it - the professional critics are boneheads.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3VIOCJZ22JZXT	C. B Collins Jr.	"There are certainly some very fine aspects to the film Phantom of the Opera, now out in DVD. But there are also some fairly obvious flaws.On the positive side, Joel Schumacher was very wise to make both the Phantom and the Count, Raoul, handsome men with very different appeal and to balance these men's attributes so as to create a real tension in the mind of Emma Rossum as well as the viewer. The viewer is put in the position of asking ""which would I chose"" throughout the action.Gerard Butler is excellent as the darkly handsome smoldering long hidden secret lover whereas Patrick Wilson plays the more stereotypical heroic leading man, full of priviledge but capable of heroic action. Patrick Wilson's role here is archtypal, he makes all the moves of the hero. If you want to see Patrick Wilson display his considerable acting skills however, watch him in ""Angels in America"".The music is beautiful and permeates the entire film so that after you leave the theater you can't remember a time in the film that the action was not floating upon and propelled by the musical score.The supporting cast was superb. Minnie Drive as the opera diva, Carlotta, played her role over the top, which was perfect for this entire over-produced production.Now, after identifing three stengthens of the video, I want to point out two weaknesses.First, this operatic product does not really translate well as it moves from stage to film.  Wheras the sets may seem appropriate from the seats of an opera house, on film they seem corney and hoaky. Do we really think that white horses, caves, and boats on a river would all really exist underground under the opera house?Second, Emma Rossum, a beautiful angelic woman who emits vulnerability with every blink of her long eyelashes, has a voice that does not convey operatic strength. Such a weak timid voice could never carry the lead in an opera. For the intimate duets with the Phantom or with Raoul, it works, but on the stage she misses the mark.Thus Phantom of the Opera is a mixed treat for the viewer."	3.0	A mixed treat	2005-04-30	8	5	3

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q	"C Brunner ""crbpe"""	This is a dark, brooding, depressing take-off on the popularity of a stage show.Everything is mysterious . . the Phantom, the girl, the Opera House, his savior . . everything.  The backdrops are not only remote from reality, they are remote from any meaning whatsoever.  A walk through the dark cavernous halls of the Opera House ending on the roof in a snowstorm . . . another trip through the Opera House and we are led into a stream with grillwork that traps the hero.  In another scene the Phantom appears outside the Opera House . . did that really happen in the novel?  I thought that a major issue in the book was that he never left once he took up residence there.  Also missing was a cogent reason for his existence as the Phantom.  Wasn't that because he was a composer whose works were stolen and he plotted his revenge after everyone thought he was dead.The same musical themes throughout the movie created its own version of Chinese water torture.All in all, a terrible movie.

Joel Schumacher was certainly the right choice for director - his casting, set design, etc. were superb.  I cried when the Phantom begged Christine to love him; how could anyone resist that sexy Gerry Butler, especially when he cries, too.  He wasn't all that disfigured, nothing like Michael Crawford's makeup - Yuck.  I must have watched both CDs 20 times at least by now.  Bought the CD of the movie soundtrack, too.  Went to see ""300"" with Gerry Butler - still exudes that same sexiness.  I am forever a fan - both of the movie and of G. Butler; in fact, I'm ordering a poster I saw on E-bay with Gerry and Emily Rossum - boy, can that kid sing!  I could listen to some singing by Gerry again, by the way.

I'm not opposed to musicals, but this was so slow and boring, it was painful...pure torture trying to sit through it! I finally broke...and hit the fast-forward, and it still sucked.  The only reason I can imagine that this film has garnered such praise, is the ever expanding stupidity of our general population. Watching this had to have killed brain cells - avoid it!  Watch something of quality - ""Remains of the Day"", ""The English Patient"", ""The Long Engagement"", ""Heat and Dust"", ""Howard's End""...and I could go on and on since there are thousands of outstanding productions - a list on which the ""Phantom of Cr*p"" will never deserve to be."	1.0	Worst ever!	2006-02-07	20	4	16
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2AO7SXF0E6IPT	"C. Dyer ""Iltpoto"""	This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. It was worth every cent of my money to go. I have seen it twenty three times! I saw it eleven times in theaters, so I'm pretty sure it was worth the money.I was very dissapointed in the stage production's sound track and wasn't expecting much from this, but boy! I was wrong! I mean Sarah and Michael were ok, but Gerard and Emmy were beautiful together!Gerard Butler was...There aren't words to explain it! His voice had so much emotion it was incredible! So much sadness or anger, I didn't even know you could do that!Emmy was beautiful! And her voice was breathtaking...She was a great choice to be Christine. They harmonized extremely well.Miranda (Madame Giry), although not having a lot of lines, was a imporatant character and did very well with her acting.And Minnie did a very good job playing Calotta and Margaret was the perfect voice for Carlotta! Minnie sang a very beautiful song at the end. 'Learn To Be Lonely' was a very beautiful edition and fit perfectly well with the movie. If you have seen this movie as many times as me (I have seen it seven times! Worth every penny!), you will find 'Learn To Be Lonley' in the movie twice. Once after Why So Silent? and then at the end after Raoul puts the Papier-Mache musical box on Christine's grave.This film was great and all the cast and crew deserve a big round of applause!For all the people who thought this was a big mistake, it wasn't. You cannot compare these people to the original cast, it's moraly wrong. Also, you cannot say it could've been perfect because, even with the technology we have, nothing can be perfect. You people need to grow up! You are acting like children! I'm only fifteen and am acting more mature than you! (No offense...)I think Andrew did a wonderful job making the new song and I think he should be and is very proud of this movie. I also think that Joel should be proud. He did a great job in casting these people!This movie made me cry because it was so good and Gerard made the Phantom seem so sad and lonely. And because of Emmy making Christine so innocent and lovable. Gerard, Emmy, Patrick, Miranda, Minnie, Joel, and Andrew did a fantastic job and brought tears to my eyes! They all (Including all the cast and crew!) get five big stars and two big thumbs up!	5.0	This movie is wonderful! It brought tears to my eyes!	2005-03-07	8	7	1

I've seen the play live on Broadway, and watching this movie took me back to the excitement as if I was back in the theater again! I could watch this movie over and over and still never tire of it. I can see why this play is the longest running production on Broadway, and I think that this movie did a great job of giving the watcher that theater feel despite the fact that it is merely on the big screen.	5.0	Feels like I'm on Broadway once again!	2009-05-10	1	1	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A31DQGRRW14FBE	"Celithrathien ""Celith"""	"I saw and fell in love with the play years ago.  And while I never saw Sarah Brightman or Michael Crawford perform, the lead actors in Toronto were very, very good.  It seems as if I've been waiting a lifetime to see Phantom of the Opera become a movie, so imagine my surprise when I saw trailers announcing its arrival.  Usually people count down the days until a movie is released, but I went straight to: ""When will the DVD be released?""  Well, it has been and I love this movie!  From the signature Phantom theme to the gorgeous sets to the near perfect casting, this movie does not embarrass anyone.  The movie is a pretty faithful adaptation of the play, with the exception of a couple of extra scenes to flesh out certain plot points.  Still, these additions flowed into the original material seamlessly.  I loved Gerard Butler's Phantom; he exuded just the right amount of charm, danger and sexiness.  And his voice (while not in the league of Rossum's and Wilson's) is not unpleasant and more than up to the task. I've never liked Raoul and I still don't, but at least he wasn't the drip the character often seemed on stage thanks to Patrick Wilson.  Still, one must wonder what was Christine thinking to pass up a sexy and virile man like the Phantom for the Viscount.  Emmy Rossum is gorgeous as Christine and her voice is even better than she looks, which is quite the feat.  I must agree with the person who didn't like the Phantom losing a sword fight to Raoul.  Are they kidding?  The Phantom wouldn't lose anything.  When you get right down to it, he never really lost Christine either.  Go for this movie, especially the 2 disc set.  It's a keeper."	4.0	Phantom is Solid Entertainment	2005-05-05	4	3	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A222DTUOB5CMAC	"C. Farrington ""Lum"""	When a phantom fan (a.k.a. phan) watches this movie one feels mixed emotions.  The movie is superbly done with a wonderful cast, dazzling sets, and of course, Webber's divine music.  Gerard Butler is amazing, and Emmy Rosum is sweet.  While her voice is not as strong or as high of a sopranno as was originally intended (Webber wrote the music for Sarah Brightman's voice)she is nevertheless well-fitted for the part.  One reviewer states that the movie is closer to the book than the musical.  On this I completely disagree.  There is no mention of Raoul's older brother Phillipe, the gypsy carnival is never mentioned in the book, Webber, for obvious reasons, could not include the torture chambers, Nadir Khan is ommited completely and Madame Giry is instead created, Meg Giry is not blonde, and Raoul dies in the book!  While the movie and the musical are only lightly based off the book and embellished greatly, it is still a fantastic watch.	5.0	Phans will love this	2005-12-04	3	2	1

Those viewers familiar with the original London and Broadway cast, and the perfection of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, will be disappointed. One cannot divide The Phantom into separate entities - play and/or movie: the movie should have been as powerful musically as the theatre production, and it is not. Visually, the movie is a stunning production, but it fails in what should be its greatest draw - performers whose powerful and beautiful voices can deliver the power and beauty of the musical score.	3.0	visually beautiful, musically disappointing	2005-08-28	5	3	2

Although the film was snubbed at The 2005 Academy Awards, and incredulously did not receive even one award for its amazing artistry, it will be forever remembered and loved by all who have been graced by it's magic! This is not just a movie, nor just an opera, but a beautiful masterpiece! In fact I believe this to be on of the most visually and sensually stunning movies I have ever viewed! If you like the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage show then this movie is for you! The actors were amazing! The costumes were superb, the music's like the breath of God, and set design was incredible! The singing was unsurpassed; especially the performances by Emmy Rossem, Gerard Butler, and Patrick Wilson. The acting was well done by all. Minnie Driver is hilarious as the opera house Diva. You will be enchanted by the mysterious world of the Phantom of the Opera. Even kids love this movie!Gerard Butler, (was also in these great movies: DRACULA 2000, ATTILA, TOMB RAIDER II, and THE JURY)is the man behind the mask, and is without a doubt one of the most talented actors of our time! As the soulful mysterious Phantom, he gives a commanding performance with presence and an intensity that Richard Burton would have been envious of. Though he had not had any classical voice training, believe me when I tell you this man can sing! His voice has a rich powerful quality yet it has a graceful classic sound which resonates right through your soul! Gerard Butler embodies the real art of acting. He can emote more passion and feeling in a single glance than most actors can with hours of dialogue. The Phantom of the Opera DVD set is wonderful, and will be a cherished addition to your collection!	5.0	GERARD BUTLER, THE MAN, THE MASTERPIECE!	2005-05-03	19	11	8

I've watched both of them twice & have to say I prefer the movie. Some of my favorite actors do a wonderful job. Miranda Richardson, Ciaran Hinds (love!), Minnie Driver (so funny). Patrick Wilson is a very romantic hero (hate the hair) & I really like his voice. Emmy Rossum is sweet, innocent, beautiful & that crystal clear voice! But this is Gerard Butler's movie from beginning to end. Having listened to the original cast soundtrack for so many years, though I never got to see it live, I was doubtful if I would like any other Phantom besides Michael Crawford. I know there are people who don't like his voice but I do. I finally decided to give the movie a try mostly because of all the good reviews on Amazon. I'm so glad I did. Gerard Butler's voice is deep & rich & heartbreakingly tragic. You feel his love for Christine & his horrible loneliness. The extra background story helps to understand his actions. The interaction between him & Christine is mesmerizing, especially The Point of No Return. So sensual. If I had the choice it would be the Phantom all the way. The last 20 minutes is so sad! Keep your Kleenex handy. I'm finally going to see this live next May at the Pantages but I don't think it will surpass this. I highly recommend this movie!	5.0	GERARD BUTLER IS THE PHANTOM!	2014-06-30	0	0	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2DE249NY4SMSN	Chad Taylor	The production values and direction for the film are exceptional, unfortunately the miscasting of a musicless miscreate leading man in Butler sinks this film. I purchased this DVD for Christmas for my wife because she loves the musical so much. I have seen sections of the musical on video with Michael Crawford and although not a great singer at least he can do more than shout lyrics. Gerard Butler is absolutely horrendous in this role since it's obvious he can't carry a tune even in a bucket.  Geez, they dubbed Minnie Driver, why not dub this catawahling catastrophe?

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1FTMRYQCWJPYA	"Chaos Valkyrie ""Chaos Val"""	I'm going to break this review into three parts: for those who have seen the musical on stage, for those who haven't, and those who have read the book.Firstly: If you have not seen the musical on stage.  Well, if you are not an obsessed Broadway oriented person, you'll probably like this, if you like musicals, action, and dead-sexy Opera Ghosts that is.  This movie does move slowly at points, due to the musical nature of using ten minutes of singing to potray two minutes of speech.  However, the costumes and scenery are fantastic, Gerard Butler is the best kind of eye-candy, and Emmy Rossum does a superb job of acting like a very innocent Christine.Secondly: For those who have seen the stage production.  It ain't Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman.  That should be enough said right there, but I do plan to elaborate.  If you are obsessed with the stage version, or with the CDs that have their voices, then you will be disappointed.  Some lines are spoken rather than sung.  The camera has a tendency to jump around during musical numbers.  And while I did think that Christine and Raoul were well-sung, Gerard's singing voice is much rougher than Michael Crawford's and can be grating at times.  So, watch at your own risk.And Thirdly: For those who have read the book.  If you haven't come in contact with the play by now, I'm rather appalled with you.  As you know, books and adaptations are notoriously different.  Here, there will be no Persian.  Or really a whole bunch of things, like true backstory and the use of Erik's real name. (i.e., the Phantom does have a name!)  So, if you are a true devotee of the gothic masterpiece, again, this film probably isn't for you.Now, why did I give it four stars?  Well, I did enjoy this film immensely.  If you have no expectations that it will be a perfect adaptation of the adaptation of the book, then you can and will enjoy it.  Raoul may be a little wooden at times, but Butler plays a very passionate Phantom/Erik, and Rossum I believe to be a very good Christine.  If you're used to the CDs of Brightman/Crawford, the singing can be a little grating here... hence the four stars.  But otherwise, outstanding work, and I hope you enjoy it.	4.0	Everyman's Answer to this Movie	2005-08-15	3	3	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A134VBX32RLZJT	Chris	"First off, I have never seen the stage production, never read the book, never knew nothing about this movie untill I rented it. I dont really like musicals but this I kind of liked. I never heard the original singers or anything so I didnt find anything wrong with the singing other than some of the style is not really my type.Anyway, lets start off with what I do like. The movie is visually stunning. I love the sets and stuff. The beginning I thought was great! It draws you in nice and easy building mystery around the opera house and the Phantom. The music is nice, the story is building. What I really like is when Christine is in her room and the candles blow out and you hear the booming voice of the Phantom in the shadows and finally appears in the mirror and leads Christine down a secret passage down into depths of the opera house. The song here is great, the visuals are stunning, you can feel that the Phantom and Christine have this romantic vibe going on. I loved the movie at this point.UNFORTUNATLY...After this Christine removes the Phantoms mask and he flips out. Christine leaves and then SUDDENLY falls for a childhood friend. Well the love between them doesnt feel very real nor is there any fire going on that you feel when she was with the Phantom earlier. This is where things start to slide I think. The music becomes redundant and none of the songs after the main theme song, ""Phantom of the Opera"" which was sung during the desent to the Phantoms lair, are as good or feel as awesome. Christine and the Phantoms romance is never there again after she takes off the mask. The Phantom feels more like a creepy stalker than a sympathetic person. The movie drags on for too long and the mystery and intreague that was there in the beginning is completely gone. The ending is not tragic at all because you feel nothing for the Phantom like you are supposed to. Had there still felt like a romantic connection was still there between Christine and the Phantom, the ending would have felt alot more tragic and you would feel a little more for the Phantom as he wouldnt seen as just an evil obsessed stalker.Anyway, I recommend the film cause I think you should watch it at least once. I hear the problems that I have with the movie are not there in the stage version as there is more mystery throught the story and you feel more of a connection between the Phantom and Christine. I dont know what the core problem of WHY the movie didnt work out as well as the stage play but I can deffenatly feel something is missing and left me disappointed in the end. I was also hoping for something a little darker but thats just a personal prefrence =P"	3.0	Hmm... I want to like it but not sure if I do.	2005-06-03	4	2	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ	Chris Kennison	"I wasn't too sure about Phantom of the Opera. God. For years I've loved the music. I own the original CD. I've always wanted to see the broadway play, but never have. It's a goal of mine to someday do so.So when I heard that they were making it into a movie that would be more true to the broadway play... I was elated. Yet, Schumaker??? Dear god... did anybody see Batman & Robin?The movie just squeaks out a 4 in my opinion. There is something missing. Fear. Dread. Maybe? The story elements of the movie don't POP like I would have liked. The Phantom isn't as frightening as I would have liked.The music, on the other hand, is top notch. In fact, from what I understand from the special features, the stage play is only allowed a certain number of orchestra into the pit, but with the film, Andrew Lloyd Weber was gifted with a full orchestra and the music during the DVD is breathtaking. That, to me, is the appeal, and the reason for the 4 stars.If you want a scary Phantom of the Opera, see the 1925 Lon Chaney version, or even the 1989 Robert Englund version, but if you want to hear Andrew Lloyd Weber's fantastic score echo through your living room, you can't go wrong with this one.Besides, Emmy Rossum is fantastic... and her voice is spine-tingling when she sings ""Think of Me""."	4.0	MUSIC enough to chill the spine	2005-05-19	4	1	3

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A18G7GG53G2X8A	Chris Pandolfi	"Occasionally, a film is so bad that it rightfully deserves to be panned by audiences and critics alike. At other times, an incredibly well made film is poorly received, a fact that is both shocking and dismaying. Joel Schumacher's ""The Phantom of the Opera"" falls into the second category. This movie is, in a word, incredible. It's a pure sight and sound musical fantasy, grandiose in scope and delightfully over the top in drama and romance. Rarely have I found myself completely absorbed in a film; it left me unable to concentrate on anything afterwards other than it's highly memorable and effective score, composed with great gusto by Andrew Lloyd Webber. It's just the kind of music that has the ability to stay in your head long after leaving the theater (stage or screen). That's something I definitely look for in a musical.Based on the blockbuster London and Broadway stage musical (which itself was based on the novel ""Le Fantm de l'Opera"" by Gaston Leroux), the story of ""Phantom"" can basically be described as a gothic love triangle. Christine (Emmy Rossum), a beautiful and nave young girl is torn between her childhood sweetheart and a mysterious figure who honed her ability to sing. There are definite upsides to both men: Raoul (Patrick Wilson) is charming and handsome, and he can look back on his childhood days with Christine with happiness; the Phantom (Gerard Butler), despite the fact that he's disfigured and sliding into madness, is seductive and overpowering, and he has the ability to ignite Christine's lust. By the end of the film, she realizes that choosing either one will require making a great sacrifice.A series of subplots work their way into the film, the most prominent being the rivalry between Christine and Carlotta (Minnie Driver), a boisterous, temperamental Italian diva with a comically over-exaggerated singing voice. Christine clearly has nothing against her; I can't even recall a moment when they speak to each other. Carlotta, on the other hand, hates Christine with a passion, and absolutely refuses to let a younger, prettier, more talented girl upstage her. She never understands just how ridiculous her feelings for Christine are, even after the Phantom humiliates Carlotta by lacing her throat spray with a voice disabling substance. And he proves to be just as stubborn with his feelings: he won't let anyone upstage Christine, and if he has to kill a few people to prove his point, then so be it.Along the way, we also meet: Andre and Firmin (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds and Simon Callow), the Opera Populaire's newest managers who only care about their financial success; Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson), the Ballet Mistress who knows more about the Phantom than she initially let's on; and Meg Giry (Jennifer Ellison), Madame Giry's daughter and Christine's best friend. They weave in and out of the story fairly evenly, and in some way, they all play a part in the main plot (some play bigger parts than others). Out of all these characters, the only one I took issue with was Madame Giry. Why is she the only one with a French accent when every character in this film lives in France? I realize this is just nitpicking, and it's really not a big enough problem to ruin the story (but it is still noticeable).As paper-thin and clich&eacute; as the plot may sound, it's such classic material that it lends itself perfectly to an operatic musical. The romance is also effectively enhanced by the lyrics, written with care and precision by Charles Hart (with additional lyrics written by Richard Stilgoe). Never once did they seem contrived or ill fitting (and this is after they were altered from their original stage incarnations). It just goes to show that a memorable song is about more than just a catchy tune; it needs to work with its words, as well.One of the criticisms that overshadowed this film was Gerard Butler's performance (acting and singing). Granted, the Phantom is supposed to represent a twisted father figure for Christine, and that does necessitate an older, more established actor. However, this film adaptation was clearly attempting to reinvent his character, and for that reason, a younger, fresher actor suited the film perfectly. As far as his singing voice is concerned, I've actually read reviews that likened it to a low-grade high school production. Are they kidding me? He may not have the greatest voice in the world, but it's nowhere near as bad as some have made it out to be. In my opinion, he effectively manages to carry through the songs. In other words: I never once disliked the decision made to cast him in this film.One of the pivotal (and best) scenes is of the Phantom leading Christine through the underground catacombs and into his lair during the title song. It was meant to be a surreal, dreamlike descent; some of the imagery, including living arms that act as sconces, wouldn't make sense under lucid circumstances. But Christine is in a trance, susceptible to an active imagination. The audience feels this, as well, by means of some very unconventional methods. But since it's a moment of pure fantasy, it's perfectly acceptable for huge candelabra to magically rise from the waters and for the music to include electric guitar solos and synthesized drumbeats. While this may initially come off as historically inaccurate, it still manages to fit with the tone of the story. Besides, Webber himself says that the music was designed to have a slight rock 'n' roll feel to it, if not for the story, then for the sake of connecting it with a modern audience.Few musicals have had me as entranced as ""The Phantom of the Opera"" has. From the songs to the performances to the bold set and costume designs, it can take you away to a different world. That's probably one of the corniest ways to describe a film, but in this case, it's really the only one that fits. And it's true what some have said: if you loved the play, then you'll love the movie. So what if it was unsuccessful at the box office? Who cares if the critics completely missed the point? We now have it on DVD, and in the privacy of our homes, no one can tell us what makes a movie good or bad."	5.0	Andrew Lloyd Webber's Musical of All Musicals	2006-02-27	12	12	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A4PH6SZ527VO	Christian Teppic	"""This face, which earned a mother's fear and loathing.""I've never been a huge fan of the Phantom of the Opera. It's not that I don't like operas-I've seen Les Miserables twice, along with Sweeney Todd, Joseph, and the Phantom. I'm certainly no expert on them, but I like being entertained and I try my best to do so when watching anything, be it a movie or a performance or the like. But what really gets me going is when a good story is told, and the storyline is where Phantom of the Opera falls short. It tells a story, certainly, but it's not all that engaging.Before getting into the movie, first let's talk about what is the actual concept of Phantom. The main character is named Christine. She is naive and innocent, without many original thoughts at all. Typically she sings in a shrill manner-at least in every rendition I've seen of this opera that's how she has sung. She insists on being naive to the point that it's hard to like her, believing in this 'Angel of Music' despite all of the evidence against it. Her lover, Raoul, is a pretty boy character who isn't at all interesting, in fact it's easy to hate him. He doesn't listen when Christine speaks, but rather says 'there there, Christine', or 'you were just dreaming, Christine', things like that, and it's just....difficult to believe in their love story. The Phantom is really the only character in the story that is interesting.In the movie, they casted well to fill the script on the characters. I will say that Emmy Rossum does a better job on Christine than I have ever seen before. She has less of a shrilly voice than previous people who've filled the role, in fact in a few of the songs she sings I think she does a beautiful job. I don't like her character very much in the first place, but she does put some life into it. She's also beautiful, which always helps. The person who plays Raoul is EXACTLY as scripted. He's not interesting, in fact it's hard to root for the relationship between Christine and Raoul because there's just....nothing there. There's much more chemistry between the Phantom and Christine.""Hide your face so the world will never find you.""The person who played the Phantom in this movie is the movie's real strength. He steals every scene he's in. When I first saw this movie it was in the theaters, and I thought he was good. I've seen it three times, now, and every time I like him more. The only thing I could say negatively about him is his voice doesn't have a great amount of range to it, but the more I hear him sing his songs, the more I like how he sings them. I've heard the original cast recording many times, so comparing his voice to the original Phantom isn't fair-his voice is good for the role. I've never really known who it is that I'm supposed to root for in this opera, but especially in this movie, I root for the Phantom. Sure, he's a murderer and not exactly an upstanding citizen in society, but you can understand WHY he's that way. He's been severely mistreated by society throughout his life, genius that he is.Minnie Driver also joins the cast as the diva who's past her prime. I've always hated this character (we're supposed to), but I have to say that Minnie Driver plays it well--and she's pretty funny while she's at it. I rather like the scenes she's in, which is a credit to how she interpreted the role.The final thirty minutes or so of the movie are by far the best part of it. I never used to like the song Past the Point of No Return, but they way it's sung between Christine and Phantom is REALLY well done. There is a LOT of chemistry between the two, especially once Christine drops the wide-eyed innocent act. You can really feel Christine's pity for the Phantom, in that in a way she even loves him. Even as she's betraying him you can feel her reluctance to do so, and how badly she feels about it.Obviously, with this being an opera, the music warrants mentioning. The score is beautiful. It's not necessarily unique-it's not much different than the original cast recording, but it's certainly very good. There's a big difference in energy between a live performance and a recording, but the music is as good as can be expected without actually being at a live performance. I've never loved all of the songs in Phantom, in fact some of them I think are intolerable, but all of the main ones-The Phantom Theme, Music of the Night, All I Ask of You, Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again-they're all done very well. The choreography in Masquerade is very good.One thing that really bothered me was the synchronization of the voices with music, or the lack thereof. Obviously, it's a soundtrack matched up to the video, but the lack of matching everything up is very obvious. When someone has to hit a high note, it puts a strain on the body. When they're singing in this movie--with the exception of the Phantom--you really don't get the feeling that they're singing; you don't see that strain. Also, there are very few times throughout the movie that they speak instead of singing, but during the times that they do, in fact, speak instead of singing, it seems out of place. These are parts that were originally sung, so I'm not certain why they changed it.""Why, you ask, was I bound and chained in this cold, abysmal place? Not for any mortal sin, but the wickedness of my abhorrent face!""The one thing I've always liked about The Phantom's storyline is that it asks a question about how shallow we really are. The one redeeming quality about Christine is that she could see the beauty within the Phantom, despite what everybody else saw in his face. Even at the end she had a hard time leaving him, and in this movie that concept is captured. It's hard to walk away from this movie/opera not liking the Phantom, but I wonder, if I met this person in my normal life, would I treat him as an outsider? Would I see the genius within, or the beast without? We all say ""beauty is only skin deep,"" and ""don't judge a book by its cover,"" but when faced with the ugly reality of, say, the Phantom's face, do we shy away? We may not stoop to caging and beating him, calling him the Devil's Child and the like, but instead do we avoid the things we aren't comfortable with? When we see someone disabled or disfigured, do we look away? Why? Because it makes us uncomfortable? This movie brings those questions to light, and has us walk in the shoes of the person who experiences people looking away from him, being uncomfortable with his appearance, being cast out from society and the few people who could see beyond the mask.So is this movie worth it? In my opinion, yes it is. Comparing it to a live performance isn't really fair-this is a movie. As far as movies go, I really like this. It's entertaining, it's long (over two hours), has some beautiful music, and a standout performance by an interesting character. Not everybody will love this movie, but for the few dollars it costs to rent it-as opposed to the eighty or so to see it live-hopefully the operatic audience will grow."	4.0	For a movie, it does a good job.	2006-04-12	15	13	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2KGCK3Q4VARC8	Christopher Greffin	I'm probably less familiar with the Phantom of the Opera than most people here, but I have to contend that this version just isn't that great. Sure the set decorations and cousums are great, and Emmy Rossum is a surprise charmer as Christine, but the film comes apart with the male leads of The Phantom and Raoul, with musical numbers that are too long, and with a story that really was never that great.What I do know about The Phantom of the Opera is the classic silent 1925 version, with such an actual scary Phantom, and that has much more of an effect on me as a long time movie fan than this kind of cheesy insanity that the Phantom of this film. Here Gerald Butler as the Phantom is miniacle, jealous, and lusts after Christine, and will do anything to keep the opera house running as he thinks it should. He's more an annoyance than anything scary and conveniently he can pop out of anywhere at at time the story wants him, and hold people in their tracks as they try to put together what they were doing the last time they saw him. Patrick Wilson is a paticular weak point as Raoul, the human who loves Christine in the film's love triangle. He's really kind of a bore, and we have two really mediocre men fighting over this great girl, and the love chemistry is really limited at both fronts as she falls back and fourth from one to the other.I understand many people like this film much more than I do. The idea that a stranger with a mask could wisk a great girl from and opera house, to his dungon that no one knows about, without her putting up the least resistance, is to me flawed from the begining. It's not really that interesting or compelling of a love story, and in my opinion the musical numbers are pretty forgetable, while the dialog in the tone of song is unnecessary for a movie musical. I really wish that, like the recent great broadway to movie musical Chicago, this film could have made itself a standout among it own, instead of something pretty, at times decent, but at others sluggish. The ending of this film, on the plus side, is quite well done, and makes up somewhat for some of the earlier flaws.	3.0	A mixed blessing.	2006-02-01	14	4	10

Great Music,great visuals, great voices. Granted, its not exactly the same singing as the original broadway soudntrack but different does not mean worse here. IT still is beautiful and i was completely mesmerised and engrossed by the singin during the whole movie.Gerald Butler's is a sexy phantom and in my opinon he steals the scene whenever he appears. his voice is huskier than Crawfords but still very appealing. i liked it a lot...although he does sound a bit too harsh  when he sings The music of the night in the part where he shouts and damns Christine for having revealed his face. But that part can easily be over looked. My favourite track is the Title Track ""Phantom of the Opera"" and i also loved it ,it was also slightly different than the original..more popish and upbeat but still very appealing.I will definitely buy this soundtrack even tought i already have the original one and i also recommend the movie because it was so beautiful everyone clapped at the end of it and i watched it two times in a row so fascinated i was.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AXVXIWJ6IU6KA	"Clarinerd85 ""Rock on and be awesome."""	"Let me kick off this review by saying I am a die-hard phan.  I've read the book, seen the stage production, and memorized the libretto.  When I heard this movie was being made, I was excited, and kept up with all the production news.As it happens, I was terribly disappointed with this movie.  For a lot of reasons.  First of all, the performers left a lot to be desired.  Gerry Butler can not sing.  He can make noises that sound similar to pitched grunting and growling, but the man simply cannot sing.  Each song he performed was painful to listen to.  Honestly, I have listened to the ""Music of the Night"" scene once, and only once.  MotN is my favorite song and he completely killed it, so anytime I watch the movie I skip past that scene.  Surely there must be SOMEONE who could have given a better performance.  As for Emmy Rossum, she is good for being sixteen years old, but she simply does not have the skills or experience for the part of Christine.  Her voice is pleasant, but she has real difficulty hitting high notes and constantly scoops up to them.  That would be fine if this was a jazz production, but she is supposed to be singing opera.  But what really did her in was her horrible acting.  The graveyard scene in particular was horrific.  You're standing on your father's grave -- you want to shed a tear or two perhaps?  As for the rest of the cast, I would have to say they are mediocre at best.  I can understand that some roles do not allow for a life-altering performance, but none of them really made much of an impression on me.  Except for Patrick Wilson (Raoul).  He has a beautiful voice and sings with expression as well as excellent vocal technique.  He is, perhaps, the only member of the cast that makes the musical performance bearable.In addition, there were so many alterations to the show that changed it for the worse.  Andre and Firmin are apparently a couple of pedophiles, which is made clear when they walk into the opera house staring at the young ballerinas like pieces of meat.  Lines that are meant to be sung are spoken.  (Who wants to listen to people rhyme when they speak?)  The entire ""Don Juan"" rehearsal scene was left out.  The scenes in the second act were jumbled around.  Piangi has what appears to be a midget side kick that mirrors his every move.  ""New"" scenes were added but do nothing for the plot.  And for me, the final nail in the coffin was the graveyard scene.  Not only was Rossum's performance of ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" pathetic, but ""Wandering Child"" was made into a poorly sung duet instead of the climactic trio it was meant to be.I won't even get into the ""disfiguration"" of the phantom.  Honestly, Tom Cruise's character in ""Vanilla Sky"" looked more frightening than Schumacher's phantom.However, there are some good things about this movie.  The music mostly stays true to the original score, which is nice.  Some lyrics are changed, but what can you do?  The cinematography and special effects are quite entertaining, mostly.  And again, Patrick Wilson's performance was beautiful.All in all, it's better than nothing, right?"	3.0	Review from a real phanatic...	2008-08-16	5	4	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3KGYTO6CF8MGF	"Clarissa ""MoonGoddess"""	"I just got back from experiencing ""The Phantom Of The Opera"" and the first word that comes to mind is WOW. I am amazed, and for once I left the theater feeling as if I really got my money's worth so please, I implore you, save yourself the trouble and disregard any and all negative reviews because they either don't know a good movie from a bad one or they just can't get over the fact that this isn't the original cast! I may have never had the pleasure of seeing this as a play before, therefore I cannot compare the two, but I am at least familiar with many of the pieces sung here and I, too, had high expectations. I was preparing myself for a major letdown but instead was awed beyond my wildest dreams. And I honestly don't care whether this stayed true to every aspect of the original novel by Gaston Leroux or not (although I think it did). This is incredible either way so lets not scrutinize and view this, instead, as an individual whole.Many have quibbled about Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler not living up to the great standards Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford left us with, and as true as that may be (singing wise) I believe they chose a remarkably talented group of actors who have the voices, emotional impact, and looks to match. There's a glowing innocence yet overbearing sensuality about Christine and Gerard embodied the dark, mysterious Phantom hauntingly, whom I found to be quite handsome with the mask on, which covers less than half his face. I even got a kick out of the bossy, demanding Opera singer Carlotta, played like a true diva by the wonderful Minnie Driver (and no, that's not her actually singing, but I am basing her solely on performance).With the thankful help and guidance of Andrew Lloyd Webber, producer Joel Schumacher really captured the essence of this classic horror-romance, bringing it to life for the first time ever from the stage to the big screen. It's a huge understatement to say the entire cast and crew did a splendid job and I will be very shocked, not to mention outraged, if this does not at least get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The lavishly decadent costumes and breathtaking sets and cinematography are visually stunning... The ambiance chilling yet beautiful... I especially love the part when the Phantom is taking Christine to his underground lair in a gondola as candles rise up from out of the water. I also enjoyed the sword fight from within the snow covered cemetery between the Phantom and Raul - the one who has won the pureness of Christine's heart (twisting every way).Despite the Phantom being a villain who kills without a thought, he's a likable villain and you'll probably find yourself feeling sorry for him, as did I, once you learn of his past - the reason behind his torment turned madness, as explained by Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson) who plays Christine's 'mother'.You know something is spectacular when everyone claps afterwards and this is hands-down the best movie I've seen in a long, long time so go see it NOW!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1GNPI6NXNIHEK	Cleo	Having read many a bad review of this gem of a movie I felt the need to add my two cents (although I am aware that the fans are generally in agreement with me).  I must say that I absolutely loved this movie and have seen it four times.  As I have not seen the broadway production, I went into the film with a clean slate, prepared to accept the movie for what it was.  Well, I came out of the theater enchanted with the music, the actors and the story in general.I thought that Emmy Rossum did a superb job as the young Christine who is torn between true love and mysterious musical sensuality.  Although Gerald Butler is not the best singer I have ever heard, he doesn't have to be as he gives a heart renching portrayl of the murderous yet pitiable Phantom.  The sheer emotion and power he brings to the role makes up for the harshness of his voice. Actually, given the difficulty of the songs, I thought he did a good job.  Although most people have not been totally happy with Patrick Wilson as Raoul, I thought he was just marvelous.  His voice is lyrical and gorgeous. The emotion and love he can convey with a simple facial expression had me swooning.  The love story between Christine and Raoul was the stuff of fairy tales and I loved every minute of it.  I must say that my absolute favorite scene ( and song) was when Christine and Raoul are professing their love to each other in song up on the roof amidst the falling snow...fabulous! All and all I thought this was simply a visually fantastic film which casts a spell on the audience.  I absolutely can not wait for the DVD!	5.0	I Love this Movie!	2005-02-13	12	11	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2S3ZLA5CZU4Q7	C. L. Messina	I know we're all not the same and will never like the same thing, but the negative reviews for this movie are really strange. Some don't like it because it's not an identical twin to the Broadway show. Well, here's a suggestion: get on a bus, get a room in NYC, go to the ticket booth in Time's Square. Get a ticket to the Phantom. Have a hot dog, enjoy the sites, then enjoy a wonderful evening of the Broadway Version of The Phantom of the Opera- then go home. Relax. Feed the dog, get the paper and mail. Get back into your normal routine. Now, realize that the two will never be alike and it's not the end of the world!Then you have those who nit pick that Gerard Butler doesn't sing perfectly- again, follow the instructions above.I've seen both. YES, the live Broadway version is spectacular but so is THIS. This is sheer genius. That's what really kicks me in the stomach. Does anyone who gives this a bad review understand how much work, thought, creativity and originality went into this? Do they realize how incredible it is that it stayed THIS close to the Broadway production? Have they ever tried to make a movie or anything creative? Really, try making something like this before throwing your tomatoes.One last rant, Amazon begins by comparing THIS to the musical Chicago? HA! Have you seen the live version? &#34;Gee, let's be cool and just wear black. We don't need... SETS!&#34; Talk about presumptuous and arrogant.(Warning: Plot spoilers)OK, now, onto what we should be discussing. The summaries are many so I won't rehash. I think there are deeper things to consider in the story. For example, should Christine have chosen Raul and why? It's obvious why she shouldn't choose the Phantom, but had he not hung the stage hand, would or could it have been different? Did she always believe he was the spirit of her father or an angel? What was in her mind when the Phantom showed her the wedding dress?On my end of things, I empathize with the Phantom because he's a self-made man, unlike Raul. His vision of what life could, or should be is at least intriguing. And what of Christine? Was she a simpleton, running off with the prince instead of danger, or was she an expression of what women  want: security, safety, with a touch of opulence? What was her life with Raul like? Yes, he was a childhood sweetheart, but what was he like as an adult?  He seems jovial, but boring. Also, was Christine always in a state of indecision about the two? It seems to me she was until she (coldly) removes his mask in Don Juan. That always seemed to be her power- perhaps she enjoyed exerting it. Perhaps she was trying to decide whether to be a bad girl or good girl. Those questions and the meticulously sumptuous production keep me watching it over and over.	5.0	I get it, some don't, that's OK but puzzling.	2014-01-03	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	Musicals to me are a big mystery. You have your plot, your characters and their motivations but rather than talk it out through dialogue they start bursting into song. At least in Grease it looked odd but it still had catchy tunes. This just seems like singing singing and more singing, dialogue and again with the singing.Christine Daae is an actress working at the Opera Populaire(instead of the Paris Opera House). She's a considerable talent if it only weren't for the high-pitched prima donna Carlotta. An accident during rehearsals as Christine start singing and blowing everyone away.Her teacher just happens to be the famed Opera Ghost, or the title character Phantom of the Opera, who has specific requests about the show and consequences will come if broken. The opera house undergoes new management so they don't believe in it and put Carlotta in the lead role, disobeying the Phantom's request of it being Christine. Plus, it seems she has fallen for Raoul, another young man so the Phantom feels rejected so he kind of loses it.One thing about the film is that it does look great. The architecture, set design and the costuming both look great. And Emmy Rossum might be a tad bland on the acting side, she showcases some surprising singing chops. If only the men were better.And the movie were more interesting for that matter. Singing upon singing and it just feels way more longer than it should. Not to mention the Phantom rarely exudes that menace he's supposed to have.If you're into the actual Broadway musical or just a fan of musicals in general, try it out but if it's not your thing, proceed with caution.	3.0	2 and a half hours and it felt like it wouldn't end	2005-05-09	7	1	6

I realize I am the 1600'th person to review this on Amazon, so no one may ever see this, but I couldn't let all these 5 star reviews pass.I love Phantom on stage.  I really do.  I have no problem with the most of the casting of this movie as well.  I'm sure all the actors can sing and they seem to fit their roles.  But let me sum up the issues.  As a movie musical this movie SUCKS because:* Joel Schumacher is an idiot* it plays like the play was rewritten as a romance novel (a bad one), then that romance novel was rewritten into a screenplay then they filmed it.*Gerard Butler should be much much uglier in his phantom makeup.  MUCH uglier*this the biggest one - the lip synching is just awful.  Nobody expects the singing on the soundtrack to be the singing that was actually sung by the actors on set - BUT - they should actually full on sing their parts when on set.  Rossum at times look like she is barely breathing but and her lips are a split second off and yet the soundtrack would have us believe she is belting an aria off the charts.*sets are shot to close and not used to good effect to give us the grandeur of the setting - it undercuts the themes and musicI was basically angry for 2 straight hours watching this	1.0	butchery	2009-04-16	45	27	18

Emmy Rossum is luminous and lovely as Christine, Patrick Wilson is a perfect Raoul, and Gerard Butler sizzles as the Phantom. Minnie Driver and Natasha Richardson also excel in their supporting roles. THe sets, costumes, and cinematography are also terrific, and much like the stage version, the ending will break your heart and send chills down your spine."	4.0	Sublime	2005-03-22	2	0	2

I initially saw this movie on pay-per-view and feel in love with it.  I've never been a fan of Michael Crawford's voice and I'm not crazy about watching Sara Brightman sing, but I could watch Gerard Butler sing all day, I wish had a tenth of Emmy Rossum's singing voice and Minnie Driver is hilarious!  My entire family, husband and son, also are crazy about it.  Since seeing it on DVD, I saw the play in London and was amazed at how well the movie adapted the play. There were some changes, of course, but it was very faithful.  The extra DVD that tells how the play was originally developed and then how it was adapted for the movie was facinating.  It was great to learn the behind-the-scenes stories of an excellent play and movie.  If you love musical theatre or movies, this is a must-have!	5.0	Love it!	2006-07-31	4	4	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1T17LMQABMBN5	CoffeeGurl	"I have read the novel (it is, in fact, one of my all-time favorites) and seen the Broadway musical starring Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman on video.  I was reluctant to watch this film.  After all, I am usually disappointed with Hollywood remakes and I end up making comparisons with the original works. (I recently did that with the new Pride and Prejudice.)  The stars of this film had a lot to do with my hesitation.  I adore Michael Crawford as the Phantom and couldn't imagine someone else playing the part.  I often feel this way about remakes.  If Hollywood ever decides to remake Gone with the Wind (I hope not!), I doubt I'd be able to accept a new actor in the role of Rhett Butler, even if the new actor does a splendid job in his own right.  I felt that way before watching this film.  I thought that gorgeous Gerard Butler had been miscast for the role of the Phantom.  Now that I've seen this film, however, I have to take back whatever prejudices I had before giving it a whirl.  Anyone who has read the book and seen the musical know that The Phantom of the Opera is set in an opera house in 19th century Paris.  The opera house is being occupied by a mysterious masked man who gives singing lessons to young Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum) and develops an obsessive love for the young soprano.  He'd do anything to make her the star of the opera, including commit murder.  How would he react when he realizes that the object of his affections has feelings for Raoul (Patrick Wilson)?The Phantom of the Opera is beautiful, haunting and tragically romantic.  The love triangle between Christine, Raoul and the Phantom (whose name is Erik, but no one calls him that in this film version) is one of my all-time favorites.  This story has a special place in my heart because it was the one that brought my passion for anti-heroes and wounded souls to life.  In this film, like in the play and the book, I found myself rooting for the Phantom rather than for Raoul.  Gerard Butler does a splendid job in bringing out the Phantom's many complexities and nuances -- giving this compelling character depth.  Butler's Phantom is more vulnerable and less ironic than Crawford's portrayal of the character.  I like them both because they manage to move me, but for different reasons.  The actors' ages and physical appearance are also different.  As said in the previous paragraph, Butler is gorgeous, and he took my breath away when he looked back at Christine during the scene where he takes her to his lair and sings the main title (one of my favorite scenes).  His beautiful eyes are very expressive and they work wonders for me.  I couldn't understand why Christine was so repulsed by his deformity when the rest of him looked so delectable.  That bit of this film version was not realistic.  If I were Christine and seen Butler's Phantom, I would have felt everything but repulsion.  Awe?  Yes.  Fascination?  Absolutely.  Freight?  No way.  This Phantom is too sexy for words.  As for the rest of the main cast, Patrick Wilson is also wonderful in his portrayal of Raoul.  He is the proverbial hero who would do anything for the heroine.  He is also quite boring, but most characters of this type are when put together with a compelling ""villain"" like the Phantom.  Wilson's Raoul was nevertheless wonderful and tender and he moved me when he sang ""All I Ask of You.""  Emmy Rossum is quite good as Christine.  She doesn't outdo Sarah Brightman though.  But she does a good job and has a beautiful voice.  Minnie Driver is campy and fun as the diva Carlotta.  I loved her over-the-top prima donna antics.  As for the rest of the film, I agree with those who say the film is campy and over-the-top at times, but you kind of expect that in a musical of this sort (Moulin Rouge anyone?).  Hiring the director of the Batman series was quite appropriate.  The Andrew Lloyd Webber score is of course beautiful!  The music is so haunting and romantic that I cried while listening to it at times.  ""Think of Me,"" ""Angel of Music,"" ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" ""Masquerade,"" ""All I Ask of You,"" ""The Point of No Return,"" and ""The Music of the Night"" are my favorites and I adored them in this version.  ""The Phantom of the Opera"" has a modern, Rocky Horror Picture Show-type of sound that is irresistible.  I love the organ sounds throughout the soundtrack.  Everything is splendid. Even Gerard Butler, who I heard hadn't had proper vocal training before doing this film, sounded wonderful here.  His voice is what I'd imagined the Phantom's to be -- husky, dark and masculine.  (I always thought Crawford's singing was a little too high-pitched for my taste.)  But more important than vocal skill, he conveys so much emotion with his acting and singing.  It was breathtaking.  I am definitely getting the soundtrack CD!  The wardrobe and sets are exquisite and lavish, the music is gorgeous, the actors are memorable, and the story and scenes (especially the ones where they show the Phantom's awful childhood and when he and Christine perform ""Point of No Return"" near the end, where Butler reduced me to tears until the credits rolled) are dark, mesmerizing and poignant.  Do yourself a favor and watch this film!  Don't let preconceived notions get in the way of enjoying this incredible production.  The DVD transfer of view and sound is top-notch.  I have added it to my film library and will watch it again and again."	5.0	I would give it 10 stars if I could!	2006-12-07	10	8	2

The movie has the capability of explaining a lot of the gray areas that seeing the Broadway production leave you wondering about the connection.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3DTUMLBZCG47D	Connor J. Hamilton	The Phantom of the Opera is an exceedingly good musical; I have had the misfortune of never having seen it live, but hearing it on CD is more than enough. In fact, it is arguably better than the novel on which it was based. It all depends on what sort of tone you are looking for, and whether you prefer Gaston Leroux's explanations for the Phantom's capabilites, or the more supernatural and inexplicable nature of the musical.Anyway, this movie version is a worthy production of the fantastically popular Broadway show. The set is marvellously rich and colorful. The decision to have the opening auction scene in grainy black and white is a good one; it provides an especially stark contrast when the Paris Opera House is restored to its former beauty to the thunderous strains of Andrew Lloyd Webber's music.Emmy Rossum is fantastic as Christine Daae, and seems to step into Sarah Brightman's shoes with little difficulty. Her voice is charming--though some of the more difficult parts seem harder for her to surmount that Ms. Brightman; but that may change in time.Gerard Butler is a little less satisfying as the Phantom. He acts the part well enough, but his voice is the worst in the film, and for the main character that is not too good. It isn't a *bad* voice, but compared to the rest of the cast is leaves a little to be desired. One must suspend belief when we are told that he is giving Christine VOICE LESSONS. One just hast to shake his head at that.But Mr. Butler does not have enough in him to ruin the film; all-in-all it is quite a good production. I found it better on the second time around than at the theatre, though that usually happens to me with most movies.So, if you like the musical, see this film. I found it very nice to actually see what the sets and whatnot were supposed to look like. I know a friend who has seen the live production, and she said that the sets were very similar, though of course larger and more flexible, since one can do far more with a film than a stage production.~Connor	5.0	Worth Your Time...Beautifully Done	2005-05-19	8	3	5

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1V4EHST4VHLVX	Corky	"What I found most disturbing, having seen the play, was the choice in actors. Minnie Driver? Why? She didn't even sing until the credits. I also felt that, and especially going from stage to screen, there was less enthusiasm and passion from the actors. Men, how would you feel in either Raul or Erik's, the Phantom's, place. And ladies, being stalked by an obsessed, par-omniscient suitor wouldn't garner a little more fear atop the opera house? My gripe is this, given the magnificence of the play, live on stage, a rehearsed, much more polished product should have been produced. Especially when one hears Webber's comments about how he felt the book was trash and Leroux's lack of writing skill. Maybe Leroux should have stole other authors' ideas? (Interview on disk 2). Lon Cheney's 1920's Phantom, while paling to the immense resources of Webber, still holds more madness, sorrow, and even redemption, HOWEVER, do not miss disk's 2 stand alone ""aria"" by the lonesome, now beaten phantom, the actor hit the emotion on the one piece of film not included in the feature. You could always rent it, and read the book. Webber may be brilliant and pompous but he's not always right, Leroux's book proves that, it has human intensity and far more psychology. If you do buy the dvd, the 2 disk edition is the way to go if you're like me, I'm interested in set and stage buildings, the actors and all the bonuses. If you can't see the play though, and this catches your liking, get a copy of the original scores from the play, they DESTROY the ones in the film. Minnie Driver?? Minnie Driver???

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A33X5YSRG6YRQI	Cory LaFerriere	Some may wonder at my title.  To them a perfect adaption might mean it's exactly the same as the stage musical, which this certainly is not.  But when I say a perfect adaption I mean they took the stage show and re-molded it into what works best for film.  The changes some people criticize make sense when you think of the differences in telling a story on the stage or in a film.The cast is well put together.  People complain about the lack of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, but I disagree.  Gerard Butler does not have Crawford's voice, but I think he brings more raw emotion to the role.  Under the scrutiny of the camera, this to me is a more believable Phantom.  And forgive me for saying this but I would never have wanted to see Sarah Brightman in this film.  She was great in the broadway recording, but a few years ago she sang in Andrew Lloyd Webber's 50th Birthday Concert, and something about her performance made me cringe.  Emmy Rossum has a beautiful voice and brought the perfect innocence to the role.Extras in this 2-disk edition are nice, particularly an extensive documentary on the creation of the original stage show.  I highly reccomend this DVD	5.0	A perfect stage to screen adaption.	2007-05-09	2	2	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1T3O2LILVK0C4	"Count Orlok '22 "":("""	Personally, I've never been a big fan of movie musicals, though there have been a few exceptions. One of those exceptions is Joel Schumacher's marvelous film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Weber's The Phantom of the Opera. The lavish production perfectly captures the excitement of the stage, while cleverly exploiting the cinematic medium for maximum impact. The film showcases impressive costumes, awesome sets, and an unexpectedly terrific cast, which reenergizes the music with a youthful vitality that is sometimes absent in stage productions. Of the cast, the real showstopper is young Emmy Rossum, whose porcelain skin, gorgeous brown eyes, and breathtaking vocals lend an urgency and sympathy to the character of the Phantom, who is played by Gerard Butler. The rest of the excellent cast includes Patrick Wilson as Raoul, Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry, Jennifer Ellison as Meg Giry, and Minnie Driver as Carlotta. All are superb in their respective roles. Many of the songs have been updated slightly to suit the vocal capabilities of the actors, as well as to achieve greater emotional investment with the characters. Every member of the cast does their own singing (or so says the press release), which is astonishing when you consider that most of the actors have never sung professionally before.Orphaned at age seven, when her famous violinist  father passed away, Christine Daae was raised by Madame Giry in the Paris Opera Populaire. From a young age she showed great promise as both a singer and a dancer. The secret to her talents can be partly attributed to a mysterious voice that she's heard since the death of her father. This voice guides her and tutors her with her singing, but little does she suspect that it is the voice of Erik, the Phantom of the Opera. The Phantom lives deep beneath the opera house  where he uses his ingenious talents to orchestrates all to ensure Christine's success. But when Christine's childhood friend, the now handsome and dashing Raoul returns and expresses his love for Christine, the Phantom grows jealous and his wrath echoes throughout the Opera Populaire. The Phantom, filled with anger and consumed by possessive passion, kidnaps Christine and takes her to his cavernous underground lair. After unmasking him and revealing a disfigured face, the Phantom lets Christine go. Then he sends a threatening note declaring that Christine should replace Carlotta, an obnoxious prim Donna and the star of the latest opera, but when the new owners of the opera disregard the Phantom's note, he disrupts the performance on opening night. The Phantom kills a stage hand, and sabotages Carlotta's performance, practically destroying her career. Meanwhile Raoul plans to take Christine away from the opera house before misfortune should befall her too, but the Phantom won't allow it. The Phantom sets into action a plan that will guarantee that he and Christine won't be separated... ever. Yet Christine, torn between Raoul and the Phantom, is left to make the decision of a lifetime.The screenplay, which was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher, is based upon the musical written by Andrew Lloyd Webber, Charles Hart, and Richard Stilgoe. The musical was inspired by the serial novel written by Gaston Leroux, though much has been changed in order to create a more romantic atmosphere.Stylistically, The Phantom of the Opera has no equal as the production design is immaculate and unlike anything seen in film before. And as I've mentioned before the lavish costumes, which were designed by Alexandra Byrne, help to set the tone of the film. The lighting and cinematography are also spectacular. In fact, it's hard to find any significant flaws in the film, at least not from a technical standpoint.My only complaint is that some of the actors have difficulty adapting the acting style of the stage to that of the screen. However, this is a very minor annoyance and the majority of the cast is superb, especially Emmy Rossum as Christine and Gerard Butler as The Phantom. Both should be deeply proud of their impressive work in this film.Without a doubt, The Phantom of the Opera is a classic.Also recommended:The Phantom Of The Operaby Gaston LerouxThe Phantom of the Opera(original 1925 Universal Studios film)Phantom of the Opera(original 1943 Universal Studios remake)The Rocky Horror Picture Show / Shock TreatmentThe Lost BoysMoulin RougeSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet StreetThe Phantom of the Opera: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack	5.0	Music of the Night	2008-10-16	0	0	0

I loved the voices of the characters (though I'm not sure who was actually singing) and the songs themselves were great.  I've never seen the stage production so I don't know if these are the same songs or not.  I'm still singing them in my head a week after watching it.  The characters were very good in looks, even the phantom was gorgeous.  I try to watch any period piece film, and I rushed to the rental store for this one and was mesmerized throughout the whole film.  I only have one thing to comment on:  why can't we have on ""Phantom of the Opera"" film that is passionately acted, and acted only.  I understand that the songs are what make it what it is, but I'm a hopeless romantic and would love to see an epic film made out of this outstanding story.  No complaints here though.  I am definately going to buy this one soon and watch it often.  Everything about this film was perfect.

At the heart of the story are the characters and their interactions with each other. Gerard Butler delivers an amazing performance of love and loss. Words cannot describe the Phantom's sensitivity, mysterious allure, raw turmoil, and heart-wrenching vulnerability. I cannot say enough praiseworthy things about him! He IS the Phantom. Emma Rossum is the perfect Christine, full of sweet innocence and awaking love. Patrick Wilson brilliantly captures Raoul's protectiveness and good nature. Each of their voices captures exactly what their respective characters are experiencing, and their facial expressions, especially the eyes, say so much without uttering a sound.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3HN4OZBYVDTU6	"Crypt ""thecrypt777"""	"I've been a fan of the Musical since I was a child. I still remember how excited I was when I heard that they were planning a film version. Well, after growing up and pretty much forgetting about the musical for a few years, a film version has FINALY come. What can I say? I'm a 24 year old guy and I was weeping like an old lady in that theater. I don't know why, but I've always identified with the Phantom, particularly Webber's interpretation of the character, although I've been a fan of the original novel since I was 8.When I first heard rumors that Joel Schumacher was directing, I rolled my eyes and said ""Hollywood has done it again!"" Although The Lost Boys is one of my favorite movies, I still haven't forgiven him for destroying the Batman series. But after seeing this film, I may consider overlooking his folly! It was absolutely beautiful. What strikes me as weird is the way that critics seem to be blasting the movie left and right! I had read many of the reviews before seeing the movie. My heart sank. Many critics ripped the movie apart, giving many examples of what was wrong with it. Some gave it a very average rating. I went into the theater with this in mind and decided to look for many of the alleged flaws. I soon realized that yeah, maybe you could find these flaws here if you really dug for them, but it's still a stretch. I'm convinced that the critics went to see the film already convinced that they were going to hate it. I have to say this isn't the first time I've loved a movie that the critics hated. I think sometimes you need to just forget about what critics say and experience something for yourself. There are far too many out there who think that their opinions should be considered gospel. This movie touched me and moved me profoundly. But people have always been divided regarding Webber's Phantom. I have my conspiracy theories about that, but I won't get into that here. I found the acting to be good to great. Yes Raoul was a bit stiff, but that was his character. You would be too if you were a 19th century count. The Phantom was splendid to say the least. Who cares if it isn't the aging Michael Crawford? Gerard Butler is impressive. He's got plenty of menace and passion in his voice. At times it is obvious that he's not a professional singer, but for an actor who ""learned"" to sing just for his role, he's really quite good. Acting-wise, his portrayal of the Phantom is mesmerizing at times. I loved the way he seemed to have a completely different personality when unmasked. Masked he's a powerful, elegant, and mysterious character, unmasked he's a pathetic, snarling wretch. A brilliant portrayal in my opinion. I had also heard some complaints that the Phantom's deformity isn't ugly enough. I saw the film expecting something like a burn or something lame. I was again being cynical with the director, expecting sexiness to be stressed over what REALLY matters. So when we finally get a good look at the phantom after his mask and wig are pulled off I was surprised to see something that was actually pretty repulsive. I don't know what people were expecting to see, Freddy? The Elephant Man? Let's face it, if you saw someone like that walking down the street you'd be pretty shocked. This was before plastic surgery. It's easy to see how the Phantom would be forced to wear a mask and live under ground. The rest of the film was sublime. The costumes, the sets, the black & white flashbacks, Webber's soul stirring and often quite Gothic music, and of course the chandelier fall, which was brilliantly shot.Other little details like the Phantom's toy theater with dolls made to resemble characters from various operas, I felt were great touches. They allow you to see a little more of his personality. All in all, I am very pleased with the way this film came out. In fact the only thing I would have changed was the sword fight in the cemetery. I still love the flame shooting staff that Phantom had in the stage production and I do think it would have worked on film. My point is; I loved it. Forget the critics. Many of them have personal agendas anyway. Go see it for yourself."	5.0	Very Pleased	2004-12-30	6	6	0

My biggest complaints are the vocal work of the male lead (Gerard Butler) and some plot issues, but these can be overlooked in order to appreciate the music and the rest of the film.

I can't help but feel compassion for the phantom, Gerard Butler played him so well, with such passion and fire that I found myself wishing that Christine would have went off with him but the way that Raoul, played by Patrick Wilson, fought for Christine, cried for her, wanted to lay his life down for her, had my emotions tied up in knots, wanting both men to win the girl.Emmy Rossum, who played Christine, sang with such beauty and strength, I laughed with her, felt fear for her, and cried with her.I felt the characters so strongly, the way the actors just took the music and ran away with their emotions, it left me breathless, wanting more, especially at the end when the three main characters, I think, played their parts the strongest.I just loved this movie, but when I watched it for the first time I went in thinking I was going to hear voices like I've heard years before, playing the parts I've been so used to for so long. But as the movie played on I realized that these incredible actors have taken these parts of this beautiful Gothic love story and have made it their own.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1PX2KSJR6WH9S	Currer Bell	There's no reason why fans of the stage production should not enjoy this lush big-screen presentation.  If anything, they should like it more!  Film allows so much more dimension, and fleshing out of a few points (like how the Phantom came to the Opera) that are too awkward to explore on stage.  Not to mention the ability to see characters up close - that's probably why Sarah and Michael were replaced with younger, fresher, and let's face it (ha ha), more attractive characters.  Thank goodness. Emmy sings like an angel and is just as lovely, and far better suited to a film role than Sarah, who besides being too old for the role of Christine, tends to make silly faces and bug eyes when she sings.  Keep her on stage where she belongs, a good distance from the audience.  And then there's the Phantom...yum!  Who cares that half his face is bad, the other half is rugged and handsom.  If only he wasn't a bit psycho...  The original Phantom novel makes much of the fact that Eric is an incredible singer, but since the Webber play/movie hardly follows the book at all, I think choosing a non-singer to play the Phantom in the movie version was a smart move. Gerard's voice is perfectly suited to conveying raw emotion that a professional singer might try to polish up and control.  I agree that no one sings Music of the Night quite as well as Michael, but he's a bit effete, and of course too old.  This film bursts with emotion, lavish sets and costumes that can finally be appreciated up close, and a brilliantly selected cast from the Phantom down to the stage hands.  Bravo! Bravo!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AY9DJWEWCFAFU	Curt Alan Conklin	After what Moulin Rouge and Chicago showed a movie musical could be, this should have been the next big thing. And it starts off promising with a sepia fade in to the auction of the items left over in the theater and the two quiet older bidders silently raising their paddles as the item lots come up. But, oh, it gets really bad quick. Minnie Driver has been great in every other thing she has done, but her intentionally annoying character here is just, well, too annoying. And that leads me into the problem that dogs the movie to the end. The actors on stage are so clearly not singing, that it's impossible to connect the emotion of the song to the person.  For as much care as the director put into the set of this movie, the fact that the syncing is so awful is inexplicable.  Then there are the other three actors, all of whom are just too wimpy and uninspired to raise the temperature of this romantic tragedy above tepid.  Its like this, if you read harlequin romances because of the covers, maybe you will like watching these comely chiseled statues. Otherwise, you're either going to laugh your way through this film, or turn it off.	1.0	A promising let down	2006-01-06	19	4	15

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A854E5FCL8X1I	customer	Based on Andrew Lloyd Webber's  musical smash hit The Phantom of the Opera, Joel Schumacher adapts it to the big screen!In 2004, after nearly twenty years of waiting, a Phantom movie was being made. I was very excited! I already knew the music by heart after listening to the Original Cast Recording with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman literally dozens of times, and wondered how a movie version would turn out.After seeing it, I was blown away! The music is just as marvelous and catchy as ever. The film is full of color and amazing special effects that are a feast for the eyes.The cast includes Gerard Butler as the Phantom, Emmy Rossum as Christine, Patrick Wilson as Raoul, Minnie Driver as Carlotta, and Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry.Many fans of the stage musical expressed doubts about the film because of the fact that Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman did not reprise their roles as the Phantom and Christine respectively. I think the new cast does an excellent job. However, Crawford and Brightman are nearly irreplaceable in my opinion. Some also worried about the choice of Schumacher as director (who was responsible for the horrible 1997 film, Batman & Robin). I think Schumacher does much better with Phantom.Some other changes were made from the stage musical, including some revisions in the lyrics, some events were switched around, and some additional scenes were added to help bridge-the-gap where scene changes were in the stage version. Also, the Phantom's facial deformity is toned-down considerably from the original look.Overall, I thought this was a very good adaption of The Phantom of the Opera. It's worth seeing for any fan of the musical!	5.0	Classic Phantom	2009-01-10	0	0	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AH9KPIWCJMKEP	C. Watson	I trudged along to the theatre thinking God no can I really be going to see more Andrew Lloyd Webber. As a whole I find his work to be monotonous and boring and it pains me to know that there is so much quality work in musical theatre out there that no one in the general public appreciates. Anyway, I have never liked Phantom, I saw the stage production, and find the music is extremely boring if listened to on a soundtrack. Too wishy washy for my liking, however I found this movie made Lloyd Webber look pretty bloody good. If ou sit back and enjoy the piece as entertainment instead of nit picking about speech impedients and accents, it is absolutely lovely and very moving. The voices ARE beautiful no matter what anyone says...i am a singer, i know.... and te sets ARE more theatrical but that makes it even more alluring. I'm not a fan of musicals on screen (eg Chicago was murdered ..no pun intended!) however this work was wonderful and i was moved to tears at the end.

I saw the film around Christmas time, and I was very disappointed that it didn't get at least one oscars for costumes, or something.I'm glad they used different people in the roles, because how often do you see the same cast in the stage production?

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2SH9ZOT6V078H	Cynthia	"Where to begin...I've seen the play 5 times in London and was left wanting seeing it once more on stage, i must have burned a hole in the CD of the original London cast (Where I came to know about Sarah Brightman).When I heard they made a movie out of it I was thrilled and expected something good, I missed it in theatre, and somehow resisted the temptation to buy the DVD, and I'm glad I did for I got to see the thing on TV.And it's an utter disaster, Emmy Rossum would do well to take acting classes pronto as I've never seen such a pathetic act : no emotions, stupid open mouth all the time. Gerard Butler could do better in acting but was by far not the worse...too bad he skipped singing classes because you just can't play the Phantom when you can't sing. Some of his songs are just plain painful to hear. The two directors show no passions or emotions in their roles. The role of ""Raoul"" is soapy, marshmallowy and badly played. I think the only one I truely enjoyed in this movie is Minnie Driver in her role as ""Carlotta"" as not only she can sing, but she can act.Why they didn't cast some of those who played it on stage in the movie is simply beyhond me."	1.0	If you loved it on stage...give a total miss to the movie.	2007-07-08	16	7	9

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2YMKMPYKWCWCR	daddy kev	Okay, I have seen the broadway production of this play and it was good. But, if you want to have something in your DVD drawer to watch with your daughters every few months, this is one to have. The singing is excellent for a movie and you will be singing the songs for two weeks after because they stick in your head. My girls play act for days afterwards . One will sing the Phantom's songs and the other will sing Kristy's. It is so fun to listen to them. But, the point is, if you are a father and you want to share something with your daughters that is memorable and fun, buy this and watch it with them. Yes, there are a couple of parts where the Phantom gets excited, mean, a little seductive, but it is a good movie made from an old story. So, if you want them to remember watching a movie with their father at night in the fall with popcorn and hot apple cider, this is a winner.  They will never forget it.	4.0	great movie to watch with your daughters	2009-09-28	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2290TPB6HLPOA	D. Alpert	I couldn't afford to see the Phantom of the Opera when the play was touring the country, but had always wanted to see it.  I didn't even know a movie version had been made, when I happened to catch it on cable television recently.  I am glad I waited.  I don't know when I've seen a better movie, or listened to a better musical score.  Emmy Rossum's voice, although not polished, is PERFECT for her young character, and a very pleasing compliment to Gerard Butler's voice.  Mr. Butler takes total control in the role, expressing more emotion and feeling than I thought any male actor was capable of.  He truly makes you feel everything his character feels, and his voice shows it and expresses it perfectly.  As for Patrick Wilson, he does a very credible job, but in the end, if I were Christine, I would have picked Butler over him any day.  After seeing the movie, all my friends who had seen the play said it was much better, that no one could sing the roles better than Crawford and Brightman.  Well, I bought the soundtrack for the original cast, and I was very dissapointed.  Anyone who can say that Crawford sings better than Butler has listened to too much polished unemotional music and has forgotten what it is to feel passion when you listen to a song.  The same goes for Christine's role...Brightman is too old and too polished a singer for the role of a young 16 year old girl.  Rossum, however, fits the part perfectly and relays the character's innocence.  The director of the movie hit the nail on the head by casting younger actors which were more suited to the role.  The movie version also has some changes in the lyrics of the songs...for the better - the new lyrics express more emotion and fit the scenes better. I absolutely love this movie and the soundtrack - I haven't been able to get the music out of my head.  The extended version is well worth getting...it has hours of history on the development of the stage play, and a wonderful making of feature of the film version.  You get to hear the earlier versions of the songs sung by Brightman, before they hired a new lyricist and changed most of the words...it's nice to see how the roles developed over time. This play has definately been polished and perfected by the numerous years it has played...and in the movie version we now get to see the fruit of those efforts...and it is - in a word - PERFECT!	5.0	Not sorry I missed the stage play...	2006-01-08	2	0	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	I will be biased and say that the Phantom is one of if not the best stage play ever written.  I've seen it 5+ times and never get tired of it.  I was a bit ancy when this film was released mostly because I've seen the movie and none of them compair to the play (although I will say that if you see any of the films the Argento's because instead of trying to recreate the atmosphere he creates his own and it works on a higher level).  When I heard that Emmy Rossum was playing Christine I got excited because I know she's good, and although I had heard nothing about this Butler guy playing the Phantom I figured he had to be good, right?  I do wish that Bandaras had played the Phantom since he has a brilliant voice, and my only complaint about this film is that Butler has a horrid voice, but as far as theatrics are concerned he plays a brilliant Phantom.  The film follows Andrew Lloyd Webber's play almost scene for scene execpt for one additional graveyard scene where the Phantom and Christines lover (Patrick Wilson) fight.  The sets the costumes and the acting, and for the most part the singing, is brilliant (Emmy Rossum is just out of this world) and it will leave you mezmerized!  Minnie Driver has one of my favorite roles as Carlotta and she is as histerical as she is wicked.  All in all it's Hollywood at it's best, with Schumacher doing a brilliant job bringing this classic to the big screen, and doing it better than anyone ever has.  I'm glad Emmy was cast, although Katie Holmes (who was origionally cast until she had to back out for another project) would have been good if not great, Emmy already has proven to have the pipes and I feel Katie wouldn't have been able to stack (although I hear that she was taking voice lessons for the role, and if you've seen Abandon then you'll know she can sing).  Anyways, bottom line is see the movie...for if you loved the play you'll love the film and if you've never seen the play then watching this masterpiece will make you give it serious thought!	5.0	Does the theatrical production proud!	2006-06-30	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AMQKZGEPVTAJ1	Dana	I personally found this movie to be a splendid version of the opera. The black and white scenes seemed to be done artistically with the film seeming to be made at the actual date of the setting. Minnie Driver portrayed her diva character beautifully.  Throughout the movie, I actually found my spine to be tingly from the emotion the characters did a great job of presenting in this film. Christine and Raoul's scenes together displayed a great longing to be together, but Christine's pull between the Phantom and Raoul was also revealed well. I must admit though, the phantom chosen for the part did a mediocre job in singing. Despite this, I still found the film to be a delight to watch. I will most definitely buy this film when it comes out on DVD, though I usually don't buy many movies.	4.0	Phantom Haunted Reviewer with Emotions.	2004-12-29	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AQ990HW13DP08	Daniel B. Clendenin	"Is there any cinematic icon more recognizable than the Phantom's mask? Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera opened in London on October 9,1986, and since then there have been more than twenty productions world-wide. In London there has never been a seat unsold. Over 50 million people have seen the show, and the box office gross world-wide stands at nearly $2 billion. So, why not a movie version to capture this wild success, even though a film can never compete with the live show? I love the story line, even though my wife and I differ in our responses to the Phantom, and I like the music. So, even though this film dragged along, and a friend of mine echoed the belief of many when he described the show as ""cheesy,"" I still enjoyed it. With Roger Ebert, I recommend this film even though I really did not think it was a very good film."	4.0	good movie of a great musical	2007-01-24	1	1	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1A3G5AV3SVLD2	"Danielle R. Shaddeau ""Sherra~sama"""	"I made the mistake of listening to the cast album several times before seeing this movie, and consequently I hated it the first time I saw it through.HOWEVER...I forced myself to go back and rewatch it a few times, mainly because I found the visuals above all else, enthralling. Lo and behold, as my mind slowly let go of my iron-wrought image of Michael Crawford as the Phantom, Gerard Butler's mark made itself known. While certainly not the vocal alumni that Crawford is, Butler has an amazingly powerful voice that had many noteworthy performances throughout the film if one can simply let go of the stage production. Aside from his singing, Butler was an extraordinary visual actor, allowing for inner turmoil to be displayed through close-ups and facial acting simply not possible in a stage production. I found his ability to convey his emotions through his face far more appealing than his actual looks (which are, mind you, good). He is not without his flaws, however, probably the more glaring of which is apparent in the final confrontation between himself and Raoul, where he is so focused on being intense, he forgets to sing so much as scream. It made my head hurt. However, he was absolutely beautiful in this role and now holds as much love in my heart as Crawford.Emma Rossum I still have mixed feelings about. Actually, compared to Sarah Brightman, their good points and flaws are just about opposite of each other. With Brightman, I was pleased by her perfect singing voice, yet later on in the cast album, it starts to run emotionally flat and sounds a little more robotic. Rossum's voice is somewhat immature as a ""professional"" singer. Many of her higher notes become unclear and a bit nasally, but there's a unique tone to the notes that she can perform, a vocal effect unique to her voice that somewhat difficult to explain in writing. However, one thing is certain is that it is indeed a very pretty voice, and easy to appreciate. I actually came to enjoy her performances of ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" and ""The Point of No Return"" more than Brightman's, in many respects. Along with Butler, she is also a very strong visual actor, able to act along with her singing in a believable way.My thoughts of Patrick Wilson are probably somewhat biased to my general dislike of Raoul's character, but while his singing voice was solid, moreso than the main characters', it was bland and unappealing, lacking any sort of luster or emotional connection to his feelings for Christine. The same goes for his overall acting. But then again, as I said...I'm not fond of Raoul to begin with.Minnie Driver made me like Carlotta. Her performance was absolutely fall-out-of-your chair hysterical. The same goes to the men whose names I cannot recall who play Andre and Firmin. Kudos points definitely go to the comedic appeal added to the movie version.As for the movie itself...There's a lot to both love and hate.Love points go to: The addition of scenes such as the epilogue (no spoilers). The Phantom crushing the rose he gave to Christine (I cried like a baby). The costume and set design; I was absolutely floored by the visual appeal this movie has, especially the Masquerade number and the design for both the Phantom's mask and his deformed face...to which they found a comfortable middle of shocking without disgusting their audience. Additional love points go to the chemistry between Rossum and Butler who pulled off their roles beautifully and gracefully and gave me a whole new set of visual playbacks to draw on when listening to either the cast or movie album.Hate points go to: Minor lyrical changes that just weren't as good as the original, too small to even bother pointing out. If you have the script memorized as much as I do, you'll know what I mean. Frustrating as well was the decision to speak parts of what were originally sung. It worked well in one scene. Not so with the others. Probablly the most horrific of which was Christine talking about her engagement to Raoul, and again when she's expressing her unwillingness to perform in the Phantom's opera. For all the awkwardness of it, they might just have easily written new dialogue and annoyed me less. Rhyming just does not work well in spoken acting. Probably my biggest beef with this movie has to do with the graveyard confrontation between the Phantom and Raoul. The swordfight...I don't mind the swordfight being added, I really don't. It was actually really fun to watch, and Butler was a VERY aggressive swordsman which made it all that much more appealing. (SPOLIER ALERT)No, my biggest problem is that he LOST. The whole point (or at least one major point) of the entire production is that Raoul CANNOT beat the Phantom in wits or strength. Gone are the smartass remarks of the Phantom urging Raoul to his death, no instead we get Christine saying ""No Raoul, not like this..."" I mean, really...how clich&eacute; is that? Even more than clich&eacute;, how different is it to beat the Phantom in a sword duel than shoot him in the back during his own opera?! It just doesn't add up for me. (/SPOLIER ALERT) My other major gripe was the visual directing of the final confrontation in the Phantom's lair. The lasso-ing of Raoul and the smashing of mirrors could have been ALOT more visually appealing in the hands of someone else's directing. I felt that visual themes were wasted here; they could have been alot more emotionally provoking.Overall, once I made myself go back and watch this movie again, I loved it, in spite of its somewhat annoying flaws. The good points definitely outweigh the bad; the main thing to remember is not to hold it again the stage production. Both versions have their merits in my eyes now, and I enjoy each just as much, as, I think, any fan of the musical should. For those of you who don't like Andrew Llyod Webber's work: this movie will not change your minds. But for many people like myself who can love productions in spite of imperfection, this movie will definitely leave a large mark on your heart."	5.0	Watch it more than once	2005-04-23	12	9	3
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1AL58J5XG4TBG	Daniel M. Schmitt	"Let's start by saying what a challenge for a superb artist such as Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber to complete something as comparible to his stage masterpiece into a major motion picture.  Knowing what a challenge it would be, considering the extreme level of success his stage production has endured, he did create just as phenomenal a production with his film as he did on the stage.The casting is a little less than perfect but all in all, the entire cast redeems themselves throughout the 2 hour plus adventure.Gerard Butler makes a great Phantom...although he would not have been my first choice for the role, he does add a sexy and seductive side to the Phantom that you don't get from the Phantoms portrayed on stage.  This side of the Phantom definately brings out chemistry between he and Emmy Rossum, as Christine.  It was a little difficult getting used to Butler's voice after having to hear Michael Crawford for all these years, but it was great to have a change and after hearing the soundtrack a few times before seeing the film on December 22nd was completely used to it and never noticed a difference.I don't think the role of Christine could have been cast any better!  Emmy Rossum was beautiful, has a great voice, and brought to the screen all the charm and appeal the part deserves.  One part that could have been a little more clear was in the first scene at the Opera Populair when Christine is dancing in the ballet for HANNIBAL prior to ""Think of Me.""  It's obvious she is a strong dancer, but it would have been nice to have seen more of the dancing as some of the screen shots and pans were distracting and much was taken away from the scene.  She had great chemistry with both her co-stars and was the perfect age to portray this part.  Many of the reviews trashed Emmy Rossum as Christine and said her acting was thin and she was weak in the part...after seeing the film four times during opening week, it was clear she has exceptional talent and portrayed the role as Webber has wanted.As Raoul, Patrick Wilson should greatly be commended.  Although some of the rewrites in the film version take away from his aside vocals, he was exceptional with ""All I Ask of You"" and could not have been cast by anyone better.  He along with Butler had just as much chemistry with Rossum as one would expect.Overall this film was excellent and worth seeing.  Lloyd Webber did a great job and I don't think he would have done anything to drastically have his masterpiece attacked or trashed.  Obviously for seeing it a few times already, being mainly a fan of Rossum, I have since become a fan of Butler and hope to see him in more films in the future.  As far as the negative reviews circling the film, they were expected but everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion.  In most cases the films most liked by the public are the one's not liked by the critics.  Webber should be commended, as well as the cast since this was an excellent film."	4.0	Emmy Rossum...who could ask for more!?	2005-01-03	5	5	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1X73UKO4S8EPV	"Dan Tate ""Father, husband, son"""	"Okay so many people have written reviews, however it is impossible to determine the qualifications...so here goes mine. I have read the original Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux, seen the musical 4 times; on Broadway (with Sarah Brightman singing Christine), London (with Michael Crawford singing the Phantom), San Francisco as well as the US Tour, I have also seen the movie twice and have read every book I can find about the Phantom of the Opera (both fiction and documentary accounts). So here is what I have to say about the movie.There will never be an acceptable substitute for seeing the musical, especially if neither Michael Crawford nor Sarah Brightman is playing in said movie. However, the movie doesn't do to bad. There are of course some complaints:1. Okay based on the movie, why in the world would the managers of the Opera Populaire ever consider putting Carlotta in when Christine has proven herself. In the musical Carlotta is truly is a fantastic singer; she just has an attitude problem. In the movie Carlotta is cast as a terrible singer with no talent on stage whatsoever, plus she is a pain! Come on, Carlotta should be a fantastic singer, that's why the managers have a hard time doing what the Phantom asks.2. Mannequin movie. When almost all of the characters sing, they have a tendency to stand there, still, or they are at least trying very hard to limit their movement. Just look at Christine when singing ""Think of Me"". A little more emotion would have made my day!3. Phantom...okay, first of all like a reviewer said earlier, Gerard Butler is just not Michael Crawford. The Phantom's character was written for Crawford, and you can't blame Butler for not satisfying Phantom Phreaks. I think he did a good job; he changed the vocals in all of the songs he sang to try and break away from Crawford comparisons and didn't do a bad job. But the movie gives the feeling that Raoul is a stronger man and character than the Phantom. I don't think so. In both the book and the movie Raoul is a hopeless romantic, whom could perhaps charm the socks of anyone, but couldn't fight to save his life. In the book he is constantly being saved by both the Persian and Madame Giry, in the musical Christine saves his life on more than one occasion. So in the movie, to have the Phantom loose in a swordfight to Raoul is simply wrong!4. The chandelier, because in the movie the chandelier doesn't fall until the end it requires a bunch of lyrical changes to the music, plus it humanizes the Phantom. In the musical and the book for that matter the chandelier falling is the first sign that the Phantom has become a very evil character. Okay so he stalks Christine and is scarily obsessive and possessive of her during the first act, but he stops at actually hurting someone. With the exception of Joseph Buquet, the account given by the musical doesn't indicate anybody being seriously injured as a result of the Phantom's mayhem. The chandelier is the point in which he loses control. Also the managers were very stubborn belligerent men, why (with the death of only one man) would they bow to the Phantom's will, when presented with Don Juan. In the musical and the book, the prospect of another chandelier crashing down on the heads of their customers convinces them to give in, even before Raoul comes up with is 'brilliant'plan.Okay enough with the bad...here's the good:1. Emmy Rossum is very good vocally as Christine. She does a very good job of portraying the growth that Christine experiences from her first performance on stage, to her performance with the Phantom in Don Juan. With the exception of little or no acting being done whilst singing, she does a great job of interacting with the both Raoul and especially with the Phantom. She does a great job, throughout the movie, of selling the love portrayed in the kiss at the end.2. I rather like the flashback theme throughout the movie; the end does a great job of leaving audiences thinking, and wondering.3. With the exception of the occasional changes (see above), they stayed very close to the score; those who listen to the Phantom often though may be annoyed or shocked with the speaking being done at time when singing is done during the musical. Relax, it's a movie!5. Some people didn't like the flashback that Madame Giry provides about the Phantom's past, and although it is inaccurate, it still provides a lot of insight towards the Phantom's feelings toward society, further explaining the line ""the world showed no compassion to me"". It was a necessary addition to the movie. Some people would have a hard time sympathizing with the Phantom if the visuals of his mistreatment were presented.4. It is very good. Overall the movie is worth spending money to see it in theatres, and again spending money to buy the DVD."	4.0	Un-biased and educated review	2005-01-11	8	5	3
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3Q2KDRTL688GP	"Darioz Svabodas ""Darioz"""	"I was impressed by the film--the new elements added to the story worked very well. This is one production where Joel Schumacher's penchant for overdone set pieces actually works. I've seen the stage version twice (and listened to the London recording countless times) and was apprehensive about the casting of the Phantom (Gerald Butler). His voice is offputting at first, but not bad--he simply sounds so different from the soundtrack we've all been listening to since 1988 that it comes as a shock when you first hear him. By the end of the film I'd accepted his singing and enjoyed his rendition of ""Past the Point of No Return."" For ""Music of the Night,"" Crawford is still the definitive voice of the Phantom in my mind. My wife, however, who has never liked the singing of Michael Crawford, bought this soundtrack because she thought Butler was better. On this issue, it is a matter of taste.Now for the worst element of the film, the point where it was almost ruined for me as a moviegoer--the Phantom's make-up when unmasked. Did they run out of money at this point? Whoever was responsible for the design of this Phantom's face should be ashamed. It looks like a bad skin condition that a good scrubbing would take care of, not a facial deformity. Close-up photos of Crawford's 1988 stage make-up are more convincing and far scarier. Also questionable was the use of lighting in the Phantom's lair--there is no mystery with everything so bright (also there was very little ""mist upon the vast glassy lake""). The tendency of Schumacher to have the Phantom's shirt open 3/4 of the time makes him seem less mysterious, far too human, and more like a lounge singer from the 1970s (like a costume from Three's Company). With the Phantom costume choices I really don't think Schumacher knew what he was doing (very much like putting nipples on the Batman costume)--he ruined the Red Death costume at the Masked Ball.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"I approached this film with some reservations.  In my mind director Joel Schumacher was a hack of the first order(""Batman and Robin"", anyone?).  To give the devil his due this is probably Schumacher's finest moment.  Not to say he advances the cinematic landscape but he has made a successful entertainment in translating Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage musical to the screen.  The songs are fantastic and the story is consistently enthralling.  Gerald Butler makes a compelling Phantom, successfully combining both the menace and the pathos of the character.  Patrick Wilson makes a dashing Raoul.  The real star of the show is Emmy Rossum as Christine.  This kind of breakout performance is once-in-a-bluemoon event.  Why wasn't she nominated for an Oscar?  For that matter why didn't she sing the nominated song at the Oscars instead of Beyonce?  Rossum combines an expressiveness that combines innocence and sensuality.  The bonus is that when she sings your heart just completely melts.  The film also boasts an impressive supporting cast including Miranda Richardson, Simon Callow, and Minnie Driver.  All around, an enjoyable show."	4.0	Rossum Breaks Out in a Big Way	2005-05-17	4	2	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A23WIR1UONF5BI	David Labelle	I cannot even fathom the idea of a single movie being as good as this one. I am still struggling to figure how ONE movie could be better than all the movies I have seen in my life. This is EASILY way better than the stage version, YES, I have seen it ('94. Colm Wilkinson as Phantom). Gerard Butler TOTALLY rocks as Phantom.. ESPECIALLY IN THE FILM'S FINALE. I think the movie allows you to grasp the Phantom's character so much better than a stage version ever could. He seems like such a bully in the stage show right up to the end, but the EMOTION that Gerard put into the character lets you feel total pity for him right to the last note he sings. I mean, the Lloyd Webber version makes you want the Phantom to win.. no other version does that. Movie or otherwise. He seems like a total c*ckmaster in all the other interpretations (Lon Chaney's especially). This movie version harnesses the idea of feeling sorry for the Phantom ONE MILLION TIMES OVER!!! The stage version didn't acheive this feeling as great as the movie did... okay, I could go on for the rest of the year about how great this movie was. Go see it, don't judge, and for all the people who gave a negative review... you probobably walked into the wrong show.. like Blade Trinity or something.	5.0	I am without words...okay, maybe not.. 5++++++++ STARS!!	2004-12-02	10	4	6

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2A8H4E9DXHQAN	David Robinson	"Two centuries from now, Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals will be hailed as the natural creative extension of opera verite that reached it's high point with Puccini's works.Although, Phantom was a phenomenal success as a stage musical, this movie version disappoints as much as the ill-fated Attenborough version of ""A Chorus Line"". As other reviewers have noted, the principles voices just don't match the excellent original (stage) cast recording (Michael Crawford, Sarah Brightman) and unlike ""Evita"" where the movie orchestrations enriched and extended the stage musical, there's nothing new here.If you are living on a desert island, have never seen Phantom on the stage, and you are curious, you might just buy this. But if you've seen the original, you are likely to be quite disappointed."	2.0	Disappointing singing -- and not much to make up for this	2005-08-24	11	5	6
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1KISYZSUGHL5P	David Romano	"I will say right now I am not a big fan of musicals.  This will either give me more credibility since I'm not reviewing this film as a diehard ""Phan"" or it will kill my credibility with those who choose to constantly compare it to the Broadway musical.Now for the review...Overall, I had to take one star away for the vocal problems apparent here and there in the film.  Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, and Patrick Wilson all showed an amazing amount of guts to take on the roles so associated with the original cast.  And for the most part, their performances were moving.  I won't lie, I shed tears at the end of the film, I was so touched by the emotion, passion, and feeling in the performances.  The beginning of the film... I had shivers.  Simply put, an excellent job by these actors.However, as I said, there were some problems.  Both Ms. Rossum and Mr. Butler seem to have problems with the full vocal range associated with opera.  I noticed both on the soundtrack and in the film that they struggled to hit or hold some of the notes, and it was very obvious, especially during the ""signature"" song of the production, that the music was being used to cover up the vocal imperfections of these two.  When the two sang ""Phantom of the Opera"", it was clear that they sadly were not comfortable or able to handle to vocal range necessary to make these songs work on all levels.  They simply lacked the vocal power.Despite that, most of their performances were excellent as I noted above.  I was very much impressed by the sets, the cast, and the costumes, with the notable exception of Ms. Rossum's costume during ""Phantom of the Opera""/""Music of the Night"".  The negligee was a bit too much (or too little as the case may be).  I can only wonder why Ms. Driver was not given the opportunity to sing as Carlotta and was dubbed?  I can only guess, based on her performance of ""Learn to Be Lonely"", that she was simply unable to pull off the vocals.  But her acting was flawless, and this can certainly be forgiven.If you're looking for THE definitive ""cover"" of the B'Way musical, you'll never find it.  If you choose to look at this as yet another version of ALW's vision, you'll probably enjoy it a great deal.  If you simply want to see good cinema, then you WILL enjoy this film, no qiestions asked.In the day and age of modern cinema where:1.  An ""epic"" is 95 minutes long with bad casting and even worse scripting and production,2.  Where blood and gore and mindless violence rules,3.  Remakes of J-Horror, Chinese Martial Arts imports, Tolkien novels and comic book remakes dominate the American movie lists because most original stuff is pure garbage (with the exception of Kill Bill),...this film is a complete breath of fresh air.  Rent it for the experience.  If you want extras, btw, get the two-disc edition.  I rented the single-disk edition and was disappointed that there were NO extras."	4.0	4 stars, and here's why	2005-05-13	1	0	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3Q80Q6YFP5W6Q	David Roy	"I've been a big fan of the music from the stage production of Phantom of the Opera for a long time (yes, I know that makes me a Philistine to some of you), but I have never actually seen the musical.  However, on my trip home last week, I was able to catch the movie version and see a little bit of what I've been missing.  There have been lots of horror movies and other adaptations of the Phantom story, but this is the first one that is based on the musical.  It's a lavish production with a wonderful Christine (played by 16-year old Emmy Rossum) that is only let down by the two male leads.  Same music as the play for a fifth of the cost!Most people know the basic story, so I won't go into great detail.  Christine Daae is a novice singer at the Paris Opera House, taken in by Madame Giry when her father died.  She has been tutored in singing by someone she identifies as the ""Angel of Music"" who is really the Phantom, a horribly (ok, not that horribly, at least in the film) disfigured man who lives in the catacombs underneath the Opera House.  The Phantom has fallen in love with her, however, and is willing to kill in order to both win her heart and advance her career.  Mayhem ensues (but doesn't it always?), especially when the Opera House is taken over by new owners who don't quite understand the rules of the Phantom's game.  When Christine falls in love with a childhood friend, Raoul, the Phantom gets even crazier.The production values in the movie are almost breathtaking, with beautiful architecture and creepy water-filled catacombs.  The Phantom's underground lair is almost haunting with its small mock-up of the Opera House, and hidden alcove with his Christine mannequin in it.  Sweeping staircases abound, especially showcased in the ""Masquerade"" sequence.  The choreography is also great, especially during ""Masquerade"" and the final set piece, ""Point of No Return.""  For those who think Joel Schumacher and then think Batman & Robin, this movie will definitely remove that horrible image.  I thought almost everything about the production was wonderful.  Ok, Christine passes the same grave markers a few times during the cemetery scene, but the rest is almost perfect.Which brings us to the cast.  Emmy Rossum is quite the discovery and she has a magnificent voice, able to handle all the various songs with ease. She's beautiful (and she's 16, so watch out!) and can hold her own with her castmates.  Gerard Butler, as the Phantom, isn't quite as good.  Most of the songs he handles ably, but occasionally (mostly when he tries to be intense), he almost shouts the words rather than singing them, and his performance falls off the rails.  However, his turn with Christine during the ""Point of No Return"" is very good.Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Patrick Wilson, the third major cast member.  I found his Raoul vapid and Wilson was trying too hard.  I didn't like his voice that much, and I really couldn't fathom what Christine saw in him (unless it was his long hair).  I don't think he has a solo in the movie, so he's always paired off with somebody, and he never comes out on top.  During the final sequence, when Christine has to choose, both he and Butler were going a bit too far, making me wish Christine had a third choice:  let them have each other instead of her.  But oh well.The rest of the cast is more minor, but all of them do a fabulous job with what they are given.  I've always loved Miranda Richardson (even more so when I remember how she played Queen Elizabeth in Black Adder, and then see her in a serious role) and she is great here too.  Simon Callow and Ciarin Hinds are funny as the two new theater owners, playing just this side of over the top (ok, just *that* side, but they were still good). And Minnie Driver, though she did not sing her role (she was dubbed) is pretty good as Carlotta, too, though the accent got a bit much after a while.There were a few problems with this movie, besides some of the cast.  Most of them were minor, almost nitpicks, but they did bring my opinion down a little bit.  First, if the Phantom is the guy who drives Christine to the cemetery, how did he get to the crypt ahead of her?  I know she was busy singing, but I would think she would have noticed him passing her.  Second, and this may have been caused by me watching this movie and my niece's Cinderella play in quick succession, what is the deal with musical characters falling in love at the drop of a hat?  Cinderella is *really* bad for this, because at least in Phantom the two characters are childhood friends.  But they meet for the first time in many years, and within a day or two, they are soulmates?  Still, that's a problem from the play (and perhaps even the book), so I won't harp on it too much, except it seems to always happen in musicals.  Finally, the constant interruptions by Raoul in the ""present day"" (the movie begins in the 1920s, while the story itself takes place in the 1880s) got tiresome after a while, and really didn't move the story along.  The beginning was good, and the ending was very fitting, but there could have been a few less in the middle of the movie.All in all, I really enjoyed Phantom of the Opera.  If you like the music, you could get the CD and imagine the play.  Or you can watch this movie for a fraction of the cost of the show and get to see it acted out in a pretty good way.  It's certainly worth a look.David Roy"	4.0	The Phantom movie franchise takes a musical turn	2006-01-03	5	4	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2U8UUNDFJEPGV	Dawn Asphodel	Phenomenal film!! A wonderful version of one of my very favourite musicals. Emmy Rossum's fragile beauty embodies Christine perfectly, and her voice, while possibly a bit pinched in her upper register, is nearly flawless in my opinion and VERY impressive for 17. Gerard Butler gives the Phantom his usual &#34;stranger-danger&#34; creepiness, while injecting romance and a heart-felt love for Christine into his character. And, besides that starnge haircut, Patrick Wilson is wonderful as Raoul (not to mention extremely handsome). There are so many great things about this movie that I can't really sum them all up without having to write a novel! Would not recommend for young children because there are some rather vivid death scenes and a somewhat graphic flashback to the Phantom's childhood. Other than that, sit back and enjoy one of theatre's best-ever romantic musicals!!	5.0	Phenomenal!	2013-07-22	0	0	0

Gerard did a nice job too as the Phantom, a tall, charming, yet troubled and sad ""Phantom"".  I thought they had good chemistry, and the rest of the cast was well done. Minnie Driver, a comedic addition as her character brought some laughs, great job Minnie !Everyone will have different views as far as who was cast, who sings better, etc. But I really enjoyed this actually kind of long movie, its just over 2 hrs and 10 minutes, but the music is great, their singing is very good and at times tearful when you really listen to what they are singing and their plight with their different places in the story.If you like the original Play at all, I really think you will enjoy this film too. and for $5 or even the 2 disc special edition which i wish i had, is only around $11 which has bonus features, thats even less than a movie ticket, and you get to watch the DVD over and over.  just really a good buy !"	5.0	Nice Balance of Singing vs. Speaking	2012-12-23	0	0	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A72YXGZ16CMIM	"D. Bradford ""db"""	Most things about this movie are absolutely, stunningly perfect.  Emmy Rossum does a great job attempting to fill Sarah Brightman's shoes.  She's no Sarah, but then again, no one else is.  Carlotta is great, and the managers are most entertaining.  The special effects and the composition of all the visual images are great.  I loved the adaptation of certain elements from play to movie and hoped it would win in Oscar in that category.  Prima Donna was better in than the original in that respect.  But one aspect that was lacking was the performance of Gerard Butler as the Phantom.  There are parts of the movie that I have not seen because I can't uncringe my face to see the screen.  He's fine later in the movie, possibly because I'm used to his horrid performance by then.  But for Music of the Night I was downright appalled.  He does't even begin to hit the correct notes.  Let alone make them eerily sexy the way Michael Crawford does.  I'm no huge Michael Crawford fan or anything like that.  But come on, at least cast someone who can sing.  Unfortunately the bad casting call was for the lead character.  Whoever heard of an angel of music that can't sing?  It's ridiculous.  It manages to make Christine seem like a weak minded twit rather than someone who is hypnotized by an amazing voice.Aside from the bad casting call, the absolute only other complaint that I have is just the fact that some lines that are supposed to be sung are spoken.  It's just silly.  If they had reworded it, they probably would have been fine.  But to keep the same sing songy rhyming lyrics was annoying at best.  Accept that it's a musical people and sing the freaking lines!!!  I've read some things that claim that's the studio's fault, so I can't fault Weber or anyone else specifically for that.  But again, come on people, it's a musical.  Whoever decided to make a musical then got all pissy over the fact that there's too much singing just needs to be shot.Overall, I'll definately recommend this movie.  It has enough good points to detract even from the glaringly large mistake in the casting.  And it's still the closest alternative to actually sitting in the audience of a good performance.  However it doesn't do the story justice.  As part of a phan addiction, it's great.  In combination with the original cast cd, the original novel by Gaston Leroux, and the romantic interpretation by Susan Kay, it brings everything in and is an amazing piece of work.  But as a single piece of work by which to judge the entire story, or even just Weber's musical aspects, there's much more to it than this.	4.0	POTO - Almost Amazing	2005-05-04	10	5	5

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AOYTQFRLD8VLP	Deborah Earle	"Producer/Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and director Joel Schumacher have further elevated the cult status of Gaston Leroux's 1911 penny-dreadful by finally turning Lloyd Webber's stellar 1986 stage musical into this lovely cinematographic masterpiece.Admittedly as of this writing, I've yet to see a live stage version of the musical, but as an owner of a copy of the original London cast recording of ""Phantom"" for 15 years  prior to seeing this film, I'd had the ""Phantom"" soundtrack in my head for years, and had always wondered what the film version would be like.As is the case with the stage production, liberties are taken with Leroux's novel in the film. The story of the Phantom's reign of terror begins in 1870 in this movie--nine years later than the original stage production, and eleven years earlier than in the novel. The physical appearance of some of the characters is derived from the stage musical rather than the novel as well.While I've regretted that Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman did not recreate their phenomenal onstage roles in this movie, I appreciate the sensibility of using younger actors.Scottish-born Gerard Butler's 6""2"" frame is naturally more imposing than that of the 5""10"" 1/2 Crawford's, and although I make mental comparisons between  the singing styles of Crawford and Butler, noting where Crawford's voice would have risen and/or become more breathy and sensuous, Butler is undeniably his own  man in that role, combining Crawford's  vocal sensuality with the boorish charisma of Russell Crowe. Butler's unmasked profile reveals a very attractive face with appropriately piercing eyes and a virile chin cleft.Young Soprano Emmy Rossum's lifelong experience in the world of opera shines through in her performance as Christine Daae. While she lacks the sweet, stratosphere-piercing strength of Sarah Brightman, her youth makes her more believable in the part. Her soprano has its own dulcet style, but a listener feels as the Phantom does that ""she has much still to learn"". Her naivte and vulnerability  are deeply felt as she confronts the issue of whether or not this ""Angel of Music"" is the one promised by her dying father in her childhood. But she can face down the Phantom with equal amounts of courage and defiance when necessary.Patrick Wilson sings the part of Raoul in softer and less vibrant tones than the late Steve Barton, but he is very expressive in his physical and vocal style, as he goes to great lengths to rescue the woman he loves.Minnie Driver is pompous and over-the-top as the diva, Carlotta Giudicelli, but sings the closing number warmly and beautifully.Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds (the latter of whom previously appeared with Driver in ""Circle of Friends"") seem comically out of their league as the opera house managers, Miranda Richardson is matronly as the Ballet Mistress and Phantom confidante, Madame Giry, and a fetching Jennifer Ellison plays her daughter, Meg, who is Christine's supportive best friend, justifyably thwarted in her efforts to confront the Phantom by her mother.The interspersed black and white scenes of the 1919 auction at the Paris Opera House gradually lend closure to the story.One accuracy of the film is the Phantom's escort of Christine to his private chambers partially on horseback. But inevitably I noted the deletion of a stanza from the title song. Like all the numbers, the show-stopping ""Music of the Night""  was admirably done, and one pays attention to the vastness of the shoes Butler had to fill especially in that scene.As the lonely malformed genius coaches Christine for stardom supernaturally, he demands the improvement of the quality of the productions from the managers. After the senseless murder of a stagehand who knew too much, Christine and Raoul comfort each other on the roof, hoping to be out of the Phantom's earshot.By the time of the New's Year's Masqued Ball,  they are secretly engaged. Ironically, the revelers sing of various colors  swirling about the room while clad mostly in black and white. On cue, the dreaded regularly-masked figure comes to poop the party and demand the performance of his own opera. Shortly afterwards, Madame Giry reluctantly recounts the history of her relationship with the Phantom, to give Raoul a bit more insight.A few scenes and one beautifully sung ballad later, the company prepare to take on the Phantom once and for all. But plans go awry, amid a fallen chandelier.  Christine plays her part to the hilt, especially in the dramatic build-up of the sexually charged ""Past the Point of No Return"".Shortly thereafter, Christine has to make a final decision to save Raoul's life, and committs an act of pity that moves her tormentor deeply.In the end, and emotional Raoul could feel somewhat bemused that his one-time detractor--who did evil things but was capable of arousing great sympathy--at least shared his taste in women.But the twist ending evokes the question: Is the music of the night ever really over?"	5.0	EXQUISITE!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AKLSESHLU5XLZ	"Deborah L. Chandley ""Phantom Phan"""	"While I have not yet seen the DVD presentation, I have, in fact, seen the film in the theater 7 times (and I have pre-ordered the DVD).  Let me assure you, I do not see a film in the theater 7 times if it is not worthy.  Gerard Butler gives a stunning performance as the Phantom.  He is sensual, brooding, seductive, and yet manages to maintain a sympathetic aire.  You genuinely care about him and want him to get the girl in the end.  In fact, Gerard Butler's eyes are so intense that often he can portray an emotion without words.  It is a very difficult feat and a high test to his acting ability that he is able to pull this off!  After seeing him portray the Phantom I cannot imagine anyone else in the role.  He has a screen presence that will make you truly weak in the knees!  As for Patrick Wilson as Raoul, there is not a lot to say.  Although his character portrayal is very accurate to Gaston Leroux's novel (weak willed, kind of a ""cry baby"") he does have an excellent voice.  Emmy Rossum as Christine is truly a triumph!  She has an absolutely wonderful voice.  Being so young, she played the ""innocent"" very convincingly, and her wardrobe was stunning.  I would highly recommend this movie to any Phantom fans, as well as anyone who loves a good romantic movie.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A20Q4HD6A2B8W9	Dennis Brandt	Gerard Butler's singing made me cringe.  Actually, he didn't sing as much as shout in a role that demands an excellent tenor.  It killed a movie for me that otherwise was very good.  You can do Professor Harold Hill with a non-singer but not the Phantom.  Patrick Wilson did a fine job as Raoul.  Emma Rossum had youth and innocence applicable to the role, and her singing is passable but immature, not surprising given that she was 18 when she made it.  That Webber picked her personally shocks me since there are better singers.  Throughout the movie I longed to hear Sarah Brightman but not as much as I wanted to hear Michael Crawford.	3.0	Visually stunning but miscast	2008-11-17	2	2	0

Excuse me, but I wanted to see a movie and all I have is like putting some cameras in a Broadway theatre to watch the full entire version of the musical.Moreover, what we see in this ""film"" are not actors themselves. They are great singers but not actors. Emmy Rossum has the same face expression all along the film: is she scared, delightful, dreaming? I wonder. Another thing is: why the frontier between the ugly and the pretty is so wide? No twist is possible.Music: perfect. Scenario: brilliant. Make-up and custome design: alright. All static matters are superior. But the film is very poor in performance, development and plot. In fact I don't like the original story.

But you have to let go of the beatuiful job done by Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford in the broadway production. This vision on the silver screen is one of beatuy, and passion. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher have done a great job transfering this story to the screen. They have blended the aspects of the original book by(Gaston Leroux) and stage musical by(ALW). My wife and I recently seen the movie and it still had the same impact as the Musical version we seen in Jacksonville, FL when Brad Little played the Phantom. Even though we've never seen Michael Crawford's performance and probably never will, it still was a great show.In closing I would like to say to the skeptics your missing a wonderful show and to those who are willing to give this movie a chance.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3PPSZB0W5DZH6	"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN"""	"Joel Schumacher has created a visually sumptuous film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's mega-hit stage musical ""The Phantom Of The Opera."" Several musical numbers (notably ""The Phantom Of The Opera,"" ""Music Of The Night"" and ""Masquarade"") are attractively staged for film. Emmy Rossum makes a comely Christine, and Gerard Butler is super sexy as The Phantom. Minnie Driver has several funny scenes as opera diva Carlotta, and Miranda Richardson is impressive as Madame Gury, seemingly the only soul who has any sympathy for the Phantom.But Schumacher, Butler, Rossum, etc. can not escape the fact that Webber's musical is incredibly shallow on several levels, no matter how hard they might try. When Rossum removes Butler's mask, he looks like a guy who has been burned a bit in a fire; or perhaps had acid thrown on one side of his face. His face does not appear ""distorted, hardly a face"" as Christine fearfully sings. Butler's Phantom is definitely not the horrifying, hideous creature that Lon Chaney was in the  original 1925 silent film classic. Butler's Phantom is a stud. True, Webber is going for musical romance here, not horror. Christine's rejection of the Phantom and her schmultzy love for pretty boy Patrick Wilson as Raoul makes her an incredibly, almost insufferably, shallow person. Could Patrick Wilson be any more bland than he is here? But no actor is to be blamed as much as Lord Lloyd Webber himself. His shallow songs (Wilson and Rossum sing the cringe-inducing love duet ""All I Ask Of You,"" for example) render the entire enterprise banal and emotionally vapid. And ""Phantom"" is still playing to packed houses, regardless of who is in the cast, for something over 22 years now. What can I say to that? Well, if audiences want to eat emotional vapidity for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, Andrew Lloyd Webber is definitely the go-to guy."	3.0	VISUALLY SUMPTUOUS, BUT ULTIMATELY SHALLOW, BANAL, AND VAPID	2009-01-04	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3LM7OBXGANBY9	Dimitri-Yuriev	"Might Contain a few spoilers!As you could have guessed the film is about a disfigured musical genius known as the Phantom that hides in a French Opera house. Though he does not come in contact with many people, he loves to terrorize the group of singers and performers who perform there every night. The Phantom while eccentric and crazy at times does have a talent and it's music, which he uses to tutor a young soprano chorus girl, who he falls in love with over time. The Phantom eventually decides his precious Christine should get the lead of the Opera's main show, so he drives the actual star (Carlotta) out of the Opera house with threats and attempts against her life. Christine is finally given the title role and she wows the audience with her voice, but Jealous Carlotta afraid of losing the attention returns to claim back the role. With Carlotta's return, the Phantom only causes more chaos and havoc he even ends up committing murder. Christine is horrified by all these acts; and she manages to find support in a young man named Raoul with whom she falls in love with. The Phantom enraged with this new event kidnaps Christine in hopes of keeping her by his side forever. I'll stop here, if you really want to know what happens I suggest watching the film.One of the great things the film has to offer is the beautiful and eye-catching visuals, which are truly amazing. Although, the lavish scenery might be too stunning for it's own good since it can become quite distracting. While, you're admiring the elaborate costumes, set-design and cinematography you might miss some important aspects of the film and story. Other things to admire are the exceptional performances especially from Emmy Rossum (plays Christine) the revelation of the year and Gerard Butler (plays Phantom). Emmy exudes such beauty and innocence; that you can't resist liking her. I was also surprised by her astonishing vocals, she actually sings better than many of today's musicians. Gerard Butler's voice was also a surprise since I heard so many people say his atrocious singing had ruined the film. Now his voice wasn't spectacular, but it worked, it was rough, powerful and passionate. You can tell he tried his best since he put a lot of emotion into his singing (he was able to convince us of his great love and obsession for Christine) and might I add that he looked great as the Phantom, I really can't imagine anyone else for the role after viewing the film. Also, the last 50 minutes of the film were quite good since it became fast paced, entertaining and more action filled. The final piece of the film I enjoyed were three songs in particular. I really liked ""The Phantom of the Opera"" especially it's haunting melody and I also enjoyed the sweet and sorrowful, ""Think of Me"" and ""Angel of Music"".Unfortunately, I hated quite a few things about the film. I wasn't particularly fond of most of the music and songs. It was missing catchy and fun music like ""Moulin Rouge!"" and the entertaining upbeat songs like ""Chicago"". I also thought the lack of spoken dialogue throughout the film really dragged it and it became annoying at some points listening to song after song without any breaks for long periods of time. I would have liked a nice balance of singing and spoken dialogue much like ""West Side Story"", ""Chicago"" and ""Moulin Rouge!"" managed to work with. The last thing I despised was Minnie Driver's (who plays Carlotta) performance. It was extremely annoying and I understand her character is supposed to be annoying, but I felt like she went overboard. Seriously, every time she opened her mouth I wanted someone to slap her. But it doesn't stop there she also had an atrocious strong accent, which at times made it difficult to understand what she was saying, and don't even get me started on her vocal performance. Minnie singing voice was dubbed, but the person who provided her vocals was excruciating to listen to.That pretty much sums up what I thought of the film. I didn't think it was good, but it wasn't a bad film either. I could see myself watching it again if I had nothing better to do or watch on TV."	3.0	Almost Good	2006-02-19	3	0	3

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A7LXWJYEKPQTT	D. J. Richardson	"This movie let me down. I watched it more than once, liking it a little bit at first but then I couldn't handle the tweeks and alterations.  As a result, it seemed to get worse with each viewing.  The little differences just became too annoying to cope with.  I found myself enjoying the movie because I loved the play, not because I actually liked the movie.  I was continuously finding things worth changing and imagining parts that the movie never properly expressed.Faults:1. The phantom... not what I expected.  The guy is young, ""GQ"" and ridiculous.  Why not cast Fabio while they were are at it?  Feels like watching a cheesy romance novel put to film.  Phantom should be older, wiser, uglier - quite frankly.  His beauty is his talent, not his face.  The whole point is that he could woe Christine with his art alone, that music was enough to make her love him. Think Beauty and the Beast, with a tragic ending.2. The phantom sword fight...  why?  Was the story too dull for Hollywood?  Not enough action?  ...And if you are going to have the phantom fight, then make him win.  By making him lose, it destroys the rest of the story.  How can you be concerned about Raoul entering the dungeon beneath the opera house, when he has already proven he is the better fighter, when he has already conquered his enemy?  Not to mention the fact that it just makes the phantom look like a weakling.3. The actors show no real emotion... something very odd about it.  They appear stale, showing no conviction to match the wonderful singing.  Much better just to close your eyes and hear the music.4. What's with the story behind the phantom?  A kid on display at some freak show?  Not happy with that background info.  The phantom loses his mystery and his power, becoming a pathetic child to sympathize with for the wrong reasons.The good:1. The music - although... there are some slight differences here and there in the song structures that again make me ask, ""why??""Listen to the original recording of the music and remember the dark, edgy story that is taking place... sadly, I feel the magic is lost in this movie adaptation.  People have remarked on how beautiful the sets are... well, there is a problem with that, too.  I feel like I am watching plastic people in a plastic world.  A real gothic touch would be to show some more realism, and not just a polished and shiny package of ""pretty"" material.  It could have been darker, including the masquerade, which was kind of a let down...  There was a real chance to show a fantastic display.  Instead, everyone was wearing practically the same mask, with little imagination and fantasy present.A straight filming of the play itself, void of director's presence and alterations would be the ideal thing.  It would be like front row seats.  Bottom line, the play blows this movie out of the water and those who have never seen the play, and base their opinion of The Phantom of the Opera on this movie alone, are missing something very special."	2.0	Loved the play... not the movie, unfortunately	2005-06-17	13	7	6

I have seen many actors in the roles on broadway and in LA and let me tell you Gerard Butler is the phantom, makes me wonder why christina didn't go off with him. Seriously this is the most wonderful movie I have seen in years. Chistina was flawless along with the Phantom and Raoul was just as good.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A17AYM8BUGC0KE	dm152k	Seeing this movie on December 24th was a great early Christmas present for me!  I had seen the stage production in Seattle about a year and a half prior to seeing the film and although I absolutely loved the stage production, I was not at all disappointed with the movie.  Of course, between what I saw on stage (not the original) and the film, the singers/actors could never replace Michael Crawford & Sarah Brightman, but I was very impressed with the actors' singing.If you haven't seen this movie yet and it's still playing near you, I say go out there now and see it.  Otherwise, wait until it comes out on DVD and watch it at home!	5.0	Everything I expected and more!	2005-02-24	3	2	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2R1ME16LOYENY	"D. M MITULSKI ""Twinglemom"""	When I heard they were making a movie out of the acclaimed musical, I was heartbroken.  Having seen the musical at St. Louis' beautiful Fox Theatre in 1993, I thought there was no way a movie could compare to it.  The music is inspiring and heartwrenching at the same time.  I couldn't imagine someone else singing those songs.  I thought Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman were the end all be all.  They made the musical work.Finally a friend told me I should give it a try.  After the first five minutes, I was hooked and proven wrong.  I had never heard of Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum so I assumed they were stage stars.  When I found out they weren't, I was even more amazed.  Butler gives The Phantom something Michael Crawford couldn't and that was sexuality.  I can see why Christine yearns for him now.  Rossum does a spectacular job at bringing youth and vibrance to the role.  The singing they do does not have the polished edge to it that the stage stars have which I think is wonderful.  It brings you to a new level.  You can hear the anguish in The Phantom's voice and the heartbreak and fear in Christine's.I only gave it 4 stars because of the young man playing Raoul.  He plays it a bit too aloof and I'm not as impressed by him but it does not affect the overall movie.Buy the movie and then buy the CD.  Both are worth every penny.	4.0	I was afraid to see it	2005-07-11	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3PGGPL7FM9F81	Docendo Discimus	"He lacks a little bit of depth and resonance, perhaps, especially on the lower notes, but Scottish actor Gerard Butler really doesn't sing ""like a meatloaf stuffed with garlic"", as one mean-spirited critic wrote. And when you consider the fact that he is not a trained singer, Butler fares very well as the Phantom. His vocals on the title song are a bit odd, and betray his normally heavy Scottish accent, but almost everything else is excellent.Andrew Lloyd Webber wanted a Phantom with ""some rock n' roll"" in him, not an opera singer or anything along those lines, and while Gerry Butler (as he prefers to be known) does fall short of Michael Crawford's definitive vocal performance as the title character, his acting is very, very good, and he imbues the masked Phantom with plenty of genuine passion.The script stays relatively close to the original stage show, with a few minor changes in dialogue and for the sake of pace. And the movie is visually stunning, from the Phantom's underground lair to the mascarade. Terrific orchestrations, too, and Minnie Driver, whose voice is overdubbed for the operatic parts, is irresistable as leading lady Carlotta Giudicelli.This particular character has all the makings of a one-dimensional clich&eacute;, but Driver's performance is charming and just suitably over-the-top.And Emmanuelle Rossum...! Director Joel Schumacher wanted a young cast, and the casting of then-16-year-old soprano Emmy Rossum is a stroke of genius. Mature beyond her years, she possesses a natural beauty and a fabulous singing voice, genuine ""bel canto"" with a sweet, lyrical timbre. Some sopranos come off sounding more like a musical instrument than an actual human being, but Rossum's is a young girl's voice, smooth and lovely. I can't even think of anyone to compare her with...soubrette Reri Grist, perhaps, who sang opposite Fischer-Dieskau in ""Don Giovanni"", and performed the soprano part in the final movement of Mahler's Fourth Symphony in Bernstein's classic Columbia recording.""The Phantom of the Opera"" is Andrew Lloyd Webber's masterpiece...the score is filled with lovely melodies, well-wrought opera pastiches and grand arias. Emmy Rossum's performance of ""Think Of Me"" is breathtaking, and hers and Gerry Butler's rendition of ""The Point Of No Return"" is a highlight in, well, the history of musicals. I know that a lot of people had hoped to see Michael Crawford as the Phantom, and while the combination of Crawford's and Rossum's voices would have been incredible, Crawford was 61 when shooting began, and a 61-year-old Phantom opposite a 16-year-old Christine would probably have been a bit much, even as youthful and charming a 61-year-old as the great Mr Crawford is.And while Gerry Butler may not be the greatest singer ever to take on the rle of the Phantom of the Opera, he is actually pretty high on my list, and his abilities as an actor make up for everything that may be missing vocal-wise. Really, they do. There are some genuinely touching moments along the way, and all of them involve Butler.I know there'll be plenty of people who will dislike this movie because it's not excactly like the show, and Gerry Butler isn't Michael Crawford. And there will be plenty of pet peeves aired as well, but honestly...if you want the stage production, go see the stage production. This is a movie, and it's a pretty great one.Don't cheat yourself out of this experience. There is a reason why the ""original"" has been seen by over 80,000,000 people, and it has translated very well onto the big screen."	5.0	No meatloafs	2005-07-12	15	15	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3RHPBNP2N9RJB	"Dolce Viognier ""Dolce Viognier"""	Well, at first, it's hard to overlook that the actors are not really stage singers. I was disappointed in the performance. It just wasn't majestic, like it feels on stage.Despite that, I still enjoyed this film because they managed to capture the mysterious feeling and the emotions between the trio, Christine, Phantom and Raoul. By the end of the film, I was just as into it, and feeling just as sympathetic for the Phantom, as I always did.Additionally, I really loved the costumes, though some may think they were over the top, and especially the Primma Donna. In contrast, I thought Christine's costumes were too bland. I think they could have capture Christine's purity with better gowns, either that or they should have brought the Primma Donna's costumes down a peg... but then again, she did provide the comic relief, which wasn't really there, before.I went and looked at some of the negative reviews, and I have to agree with what a lot of them are saying. Still, I did manage to enjoy watching, but yeah the singing was a big problem.I especially loved Christine's cloak, in the graveyard. Oh, I wish I could find one like it!So, anyway, it had it's issues, but still made me feel the way I did every time I saw it in New York.	4.0	Surprisingly Good	2012-03-01	2	1	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1LG40103K831C	D. O'Loughlin	"In spite of the lavish sets, vibrant costumes and visually appealing cinematography, this filmed-version of Phantom is hopelessly dull, leaden and uninspired; and, unlike the soaring and luminous chandelier in the opening sequence, regrettably earthbound, and emotionally unsatisfying.Many missteps, and unfortunate miscastings leaves this phantom ""dead-in-the-lair"" and a dismal disappointment. Schumacher would do well to view films by masters, e.g. Cukor, Wyler, Minnelli, etc., should he ever be re-hired to direct another screen musical. (Shame on Weber for recruiting him in the first place.)One star for Rossum who succeeds where Butler fails. Overall, this film pales in comparison to the sensational musical play  millions of people will continue to relish and enjoy in theatres across the globe."	1.0	A Phantom To Phorever Phorget	2005-03-04	43	12	31

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1SC4WGYGQB9SV	"Donna Bennett ""Chandalia"""	I am so glad I rented The Phantom of the Opera before considering purchasing it.  This would have been a fairly decent movie had Gerard Butler not been cast as the Phantom.  My ex's caterwauling to the Broadway CD was more pleasant-sounding!  The only thing that was salvagable was the plotline of Christine Daae and Raoul.  That was well-played, and not overdone, which was the downside of the Broadway musical.If this had been a strictly acting movie, Gerard Butler would be a halfways decent Phantom.  But his singing killed the mood for me.	1.0	Major Disappointment	2005-05-05	23	10	13
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1JKA3XMMLTAYX	Donna G. Davis	Finally,  (after seeing the stage production) the movie gives me the beginning, middle and ending.  I loved it.  I thought the Phantom being younger added so much to the story.  Emmy Rossen, Gerard Butler and Patrick Wilson were exactly the right choices in my opinion.  The beginning was great when the chandelier brought the old opera house alive again.  The music, acting, and the story became so real to me I actually cried when Christine showed him compassion in spite of all the evil things he had done.  I came away thinking how being cruel to someone can make that person scared, sad and ultimately cruel beyond the point of no return, except through forgiveness from God.  It was truly awesome, soul searching and it truly made my heart sing.  Thank you to all who brought it to us via the movie theatre.For all the criticism I've read of Gerard Butler in the role of the Phantom - I would submit that he made the Phantom real and compelling.  When I saw Michael Crawford in the stage production I thought he was her father or at the very least a father figure.  Gerard Butler brought emotion and you could feel the intense attraction that he felt for Christine and she felt for him.  I really believed if he hadn't become obsessed to the point of killing people - she could have really loved him.  But alas, that's what makes the story so compelling.  Raoul was her first love and her heart ended up where it belonged - with him.  I never had the feeling during the stage production (which I saw 2 times) that she might never have forgotten the Phantom.  I did have that feeling in the movie, which I saw 3 times and pre-ordered the DVD.  Also purchased the musical sound track.I think sometimes the critics look too much for perfection - when what most of us really feel are the emotions of real life and our imperfections.  I think all the actors were amazing and did an awesome job with very difficult and demanding roles.It was so refreshing to see some new faces and talent that I'm sure we'll be hearing alot more about in the future.  Kudos to Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher.	5.0	My favorite movie musical ever!	2005-03-05	15	14	1

His presentation of the Phantom is so intense and sensual, his heartfelt renditions of his musical numbers so haunting and beautiful, that women of all ages, all over the country are wishing they were Christine and, as Amanda Richards so Perfectly said in her review: ""would have to be dragged out of that boudoire with wild horses and a bulldozer"". He portrays such a deep love, such longing and tender vulnerability, that you have to wonder what she was thinking when she left.Kudos to this fabulous actor who has so many women wishing for such a man as the Phantom, regardless of his disfigurement.

I have always loved musicals and operas, I played in the band for 10 years, and did high school and college theater.  I own the CD version of the play and was pleased at how well the movie followed the play. Cause you know how Hollywood likes to change things around. I will be seeing it again on the big screen and I recommend it to everyone.  As a matter of fact when it comes out on DVD I will own it. I hope that I get to London to see the play cause I have always loved The Phantom of the Opera.  The movie made me want to go even more. To bad Gerard Butler isn't doing the Phantom lol.

So I bought it when it first came out on DVD...and I wasn't disappointed!From the moment you see the chandelier come to life, to the final scene, you are sent on an emotional and visual adventure. I have watched this movie SO many times over the last year and a half, that I've lost count...and I STILL get goosebumps when the chandelier is shown at the auction!Beautiful music, amazing cinematography, lots of symbolism, and a cast of up and coming (not to mention extremely talented and gorgeous) actors that will steal your heart. Gerard Butler plays the most amazing Phantom that I have ever seen, and truly makes the role his own. He exudes raw sex appeal, thus showing how Christine would be apt to fall for the Phantom. He also portrays the complexities of the Phantoms character very well. His voice is just how you might imagine the Phantom's voice...beautifully haunting, gravelly at times, with the ability to touch your soul. Emmy Rossum makes a wonderful Christine...sweet, beautiful, and she sings like an angel.Andrew Lloyd Webber is a musical genious, with incredible vision! Add Director Joel Schumacher to the mix, and you end up with a visually stunning movie! You will fall in love with this movie from the start!I have all three DVD's (Wide Screen, Full Screen, and this Two-Disc Set) for my collection...and this one is THE best!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3ATG970UJ5WME	"Dreaming of a fantastic fictional world! ""Boo..."	"I don't understand the low reviews/stars, unless they were written by the critics who for some unphantomly known reason did not like the movie!I loved the movie, and I was really surprised with Gerard Butler's singing. Word on the street is that Andrew Lloyd Webber himself chose him for the part of the Phantom due to his deep voice, btw he does sing.  Emmy Rossum, well, we all know she can sing and she was only 17 at the time, but as Christine she was simply outstanding. I must admit I never did care for the world famous Michael Crawford's voice, Yes, I am aware he is a trained voice, but as angelical as the Phantom's voice is to be, I fell in love with Gerard's voice, (I love his accent). Anyhow,in this movie you will fall in love with the character. You will suffer with him,you will feel his pain!! Now for those Broadway snobs who dissed the movie, you must watch it with an open mind and see it for what it is, a different yet alike version of Broadway. Raoul, the only time I saw emotion on his face and made you feel sorry for him was when Christine and The Phantom sing Point of No Return, I guess he realizes Christine is very much attracted to The Phantom.  I almost forgot Minnie Driver is simply amazing as the Diva Carlotta, unfortunately her voice was dubbed for the movie but she does sing the song ""Learn to be Lonely"" at the end credits, a song which could've been a bit longer it's beautiful. Oh, and don't forget to purchase the CD."	5.0	Impressively and hauntingly beautiful!	2013-06-18	0	0	0

I had planned to rush out and see this movie, but I waited. It was just on PPV and I watched it with my two teenaged sons and their friend... I was mesmerized... I  actually got goosebumps many times, and the boys watched almost in silence the whole 2 1/2 hours.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A35YWA2V4QHOJ3	"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12"""	I've never been a big fan of musicals.  For that reason, my 4 star rating is considerably high for a DVD that belongs to the genre.  This is certainly one of the best musicals I've ever seen, and people who are big fans of musicals are sure to enjoy it even more than I did.The big budget is certainly showcased in the movie.  It's filled with eye-candy sets & props that take us back to the late 19th century France.  Everything about the film is well done & top notch, from the singing to the acting.  The casting department deserves plenty of accolades.The story itself is a take-off on the beauty & the beast motif.  Fans of this somewhat repeated theme are sure to like this movie.  I believe that the recent V FOR VENDETTA movie actually has some parallels  with PHANTOM on a couple different points.PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is surely worth seeing at least once, even if you're not one who stays awake @ night thinking of the next musical you'll see.  When it comes to musicals, this is among the very best!	4.0	Meet the phantom!	2007-01-14	0	0	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2A0SBN2A7IIJH	Dr. Salim Khalil Haddad	This dvd is absolutely fantastic. The music is gripping, especially the opening organ tune of the Phantom with its tremendous base. The songs are beautiful. Emmy Rossum, as Christine, sings with a heavenly voice and the way she looks at the phantom is nothing less than tantalizing. Even at the end when she gives him back the ring, there is a sense of pity and pathos mixed up with a desire that says I wish it could have been possible. Gerard Butler, as the Phantom, sings with singular emotion and is superb. Minnie Driver, as Carlota, is a source of much fun with her angry antics and she is priceless. I watched the dvd repeatedly having been enchanted by the grandeur of the story, the songs and lavish reproduction of the magnificent opera house and other settings. The production of the film cannot be faulted and the dvd does not miss anything.	5.0	The Phantom of the Opera	2009-02-17	2	2	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3TJ2T0AEUA20N	D. Shelton	"First off, I will admit I have never seen the Broadway production but I have listened to the Broadway  soundtrack for years. I could spot every word change of every song in the movie. But they were all changes for the better, I believe.I was afraid after all these years of wondering what it would be like to finally see the songs I loved be performed on screen, I might be disappointed, but I definately wasn't. I believe this will go into my collection, as one of my most prized DVDs.Emmy Rossum was incredible as Christine. Her voice was flawless. Minnie Driver was comedic as Carlotta. The only thing that disappointed me a bit, at first, was that Gerard Butler was, as was quoted in another review here, ""the man who was NOT Michael Crawford"". His voice was very different from Crawford's but I do not believe Crawford could have given the sensual performance that Butler did. I really would have had a hard time chosing, had I been Christine, between the Phantom and Raoul. All in all, I think Gerard Butler did a great job.The backdrop of the theater and surroundings were so eerie, yet beautiful. I think my favorite part was Christine singing ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" in that cemetary setting. Very haunting.I just wish I could thank Joel Schumacher for bringing all the spectacle of the Broadway musical into my home, as I am  someone who, I am sure, will never see it performed on the stage."	5.0	Spectacular	2005-05-24	2	1	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A355NKYLT721RC	"D. Tercho ""Sassy Gal"""	I've seen this movie four times so far and it keeps getting better!Anyone who -really- knows and understands the Phantom story, and particularly  ALW's version, will love this movie.I have seen the Play numerous times on Broadway and in traveling troupes and my main concern was that they would make the movie completely unlike the play.My worries were unfounded.Andrew Lloyd Webber did an excellent job of keeping the fantastic music almost the same and the creative control he kept over the whole production kept the movie as close to the beloved play as possible.I too am a big fan of both Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman and I would have LOVED to see them in this movie, however it didn't work that way and to attempt to compare those who did star in the movie with the original actors is unfair.I feel that the entire cast in the movie did an excellent job.Gerard Butler's (phantom) voice (more of a rock feel) was a perfect compliment/contrast to Patrick Wilson (Raoul's) beautiful lyric tenor.I have to applaud Patrick, for I really -believed- in his love for Christine.Emmy Rossum (Christine) did a remarkable job and has an extremely pretty voice and she brought a very refreshing innocence to the role.Minnie Driver as Carlotta was FANTASTIC! She was, as intended in the character, over the edge and flamboyant!'Meg' was wonderfully portrayed, as well as 'Madame Giry' and the Managers.Anyone with a heart would shed tears at the incredibly sad ending.Again, anyone who really understands the story, has compassion on the plight of the tragic love triangle and who loves the music from either the CD or the play, will enjoy this movie.Someone mentioned the black and white scenes looking 'cheap'.They were supposed to look that way, to give a feel of what motion pictures, in their infancy, were like.It was also Raoul's memories; and it took place in the early 1900s.  It's not supposed to look perfectly modern!Overall, the movie is brilliant.It gives the feel of the Victorian Age, yet deals with the timeless subject, that most of us can relate to, and that is that no one wants or deserves to live a life devoid of love.And, I hope the story makes us examine ourselves and our prejudices for those we consider 'ugly' or 'different'	5.0	WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!	2005-01-04	10	10	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A26C0XN03WFP25	Dvarg	This movie is far less bad than I feared.It is still little else than fluff.When watching this, even the most devoted phan must realise too much of the songs in POTO goes on without anything actually happening... I don't know whether the director or the dramaturg is to blame, but the actors don't have anything to do during such endless songas songs as the title tune, Music Of The Night and Wishing You Were somehow Here Again. During Think Of Me, at least the character of Roul is introduced, while little else is going on.Happily such musical scenes like Notes/Prima Donna work very good in this adaption!One thing one cannot help but notice when watching the extra material to this DVD, is the utter and complete lack of any mentioning of the text! -this is really baffling and striking. The musical does suffer from some weird and unfortunate dramaturgic flaws and awkward lyrics. This is not discussed at all! Instead Andrew Lloyd Webber and the rest of the creative crew (except the lyricists and book writers) discuss such lame things as the number of musicians in the orchestra (!), the sexyness of the cast and the angles of the falling chandelier.This does nothing to silence the misconception that musicals are shallow and only about empty spectacle.I will nevertheless recommend watching this movie, if only for the afore mentioned Notes/Prima Donna scene, which works wonderfully!	2.0	But what about the TEXT?	2005-10-30	11	4	7

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ	"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	"Sumptuous, rich, lush and inviting. Like a gilt-edged dream, Joel Schumacher's ""Phantom of the Opera"" is a triumphant love note to beauty, song and scenery.Adapted from Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical (and Gaston Leroux's novel), this movie ends up being beautiful in every scene, with solid acting and and a tragic antihero. The singing, the sumptuous sets, the acting -- all are the ingredients of a musical tour de force.In 1870, a Paris opera house is under new management -- just as diva Carlotta (Minnie Driver, a glorious diva-from-hell) is almost killed by a stage curtain, and stomps out. Fortunately Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum), taught by a mystery tutor, can take over the soprano's role, and soon becomes famous for her singing. Even better, it catches the attention of her childhood sweetheart, Vicomte Raoul (Patrick Wilson).But Raoul doesn't realize that Christine was taught by a disfigured, tortured genius who hides under the opera house. And the Phantom of the Opera is not only determined that Christine should be the star, but also be his wife. And he's willing to kill for it. Can Raoul break the Phantom's hold over Christine, or will she embrace ""the music of the night""?Watching this, it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same guy who did ""Phone Booth"" and the awful ""Batman and Robin."" Instead it looks as if the love child of Jean Cocteau and Peter Jackson decided to direct a musical, swathed in masks, roses, gilt angels, snow and velvet.And it all wraps around Webber's solid songs (""Turn your face away from the garish light of day/turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light/and listen to the music of the night!"") from the stage musical. Most of the lines are sung, which surprisingly doesn't detract from their believability. And there's plenty of fun with the cameras, whether it's the dizzying views of the backstage, or a zoom through a stone floor to the Phantom's face.Schumacher also adds a few extra scenes, including a sword fight between Raoul and the Phantom, which makes the vicomte seem more passionate; and a flashback to the Phantom's horrific childhood. What's more, the story is framed by scenes from forty years later -- sepia-toned scenes in the dusty remains of the Opera.The three most prominent roles are what make or break this movie, and in this case, the casting is nearly ideal. Rossum has the ingenue looks -- and the powerful pipes -- to carry off the role of Christine, torn between her love and her passion. Similarly, Patrick Wilson gives some brains and strength to Raoul, and despite the romantic appeal of the Phantom, Raoul isn't hard to cheer for.Gerard Butler is a bit more difficult. Most of the time his singing is solid, and his acting is powerful and tragic as the ""loathsome gargoyle, who burns in hell, but secretly yearns for heaven."" The scene where he tries to seduce Christine is deeply sensual. But occasionally his performance gets really hammy, such as the unmasking, where he flings himself around screaming, ""You little prying Pandora! You little demon!""Lush, exquisite and passionate, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is a solid adaptation of Webber's musical, with good acting and excellent direction. A triumph for ""the music of the night."""	5.0	In dreams he came	2008-10-21	4	4	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1XC099UZR8591	"East West ""Don Quijotee"""	"I loved this movie for its story, its color, vibrancy, emotion and touch. On first view I will admit that the voices seemed peculiar, but not so different from the stage production. On subsequent viewings the story comes out deep, rich and provocative. It is a wonderful adaptation and filled with rich imagery expected from film while retaining the essence of its stage production origins.This is a tragedy of heart. Circumstance has brought these players together. Let's call it fate and all are the supporting cast to this masquerade, but central is the love triangle which will always be shared from behind every shadow by Roul, the Phantom, with Christine in the middle, forever touch by the Phantoms gift of music. The phantom, despite his raging anger, jealous sensitivities, self-esteem issues, deceptions and violent outburst (sometimes resulting in murder), is in the end a sympathetic character. I am sure many of us can sympathize with loving someone more than they love us. Some of us have even played our own simple games of deception (or denial) in order to hold onto any thread of connections alive, only in the end being futile and painful when the object of our affections finds their one true love. The Phantom plays this childish game, being loved (and feared) for what he can do for/to others, he is fooled into believing that love is what he can control and not what is felt, albeit feeling it all the while.This is a wonderful story, although filled with adult themes which may be even too emotionally charge and morally contradicting for most children and teens. Be prepared to cry yourself.How can you love, fear, hate, admire, respect and pity someone all at the same time is the dilemma of Christine, the focus of the Phantom's twisted ambitions and his one true love? The two share many years together, although never meeting, while the phantom pretends to be the spirit of Christine's fathers long since passed away. And, so, these two are forever entwined. And it is this journey which forever binds Christine and the Phantom in both love or tragedy.I was moved to tears as the ending theme song reminds us of the eternal solitude the Phantom must bare, having tasted love for all of a brief moment while his hidden unrequited perpetual yearning for one woman's love continues beyond his failed attempts to own her. And it is this fatal love which haunts all (Roul, Christine & Phantom) to their graves long after the opera house was burned and the object of their love, Christine, has died and the suitors, all the while aware of each other and that she loved them both although only one was fortunate enough to enjoy the fulfillment of her devotions. A bitter sweet triangle reminiscent of Serrano De Bergerac.The story is filled with emotion and it is the story which makes the movie so rich and fulfilling. Christine and Roul were separated by a family tragedy, but have never lost the sweetness of their young love. The Phantom, abandoned by his mother and enslaved and brutalized by a gypsy circus an mockingly displayed as `the Devil's Child' gains freedom by murdering his abusive capture and foreshadowing his ""lust for blood"". He is saved by a patron to his side show, a young ballet student (Madame Gyri) who  feels sympathy for his treatment and hastily hides him away at the opera house. It is there he develops into a man. And it is certain that the exaggerations of the operatic stage productions (themes being typically murder, betrayal, etc.) and the quirky lifestyles of the stage performers are likely relevant to why the Phantom is so emotionally charged and dramatic in nature.Equaling fulfilling is the excellent editing as the moving flows along, never boring, always engaging, foreshadowing and directing the audience just enough to add meaning to future events, but in the end allowing enough mystery to set the imagination free to conclude the story as one personally desires. The costuming is just as outrageous as you would expect from the real world fantasy of stage productions. The movie adaptation adds continuity, special and chronological which can only be alluded to in the stage production which adds greatly to understanding the story and plot. Flashbacks are also used to provide both chronological and emotional clarity to the script and add a rich depth to the performance and emotional story line by eliciting form the audience some self-reflection as to both the control and uncontrolled fateful courses of their lives.And thus the story begins. Each member of our love triangle has grown to adulthood, full of life and hope yet Christine and the Phantom are haunted by their own tragedies. They are all about to be reborn through a trial of fire centered around the Phantoms misguided beliefs that he must deceive wantonly to be accepted and that control will bring him love ...and ironically, accomplish all this from among the shadows, afraid of revealing his deforming birth defect. The Phantom's existence becomes more production than reality. Perhaps this is why the Phantom is willing to destroy the essence of his soul ...his music and the opera house which is the stage for his life's purpose. And all this rage which has ""turn into madness"" is thus magnified by his budding manhood's violent jealousy, further `distorting' his soul and driving away his love."	5.0	Hate, Love and Forgiveness ...Full of Contradictions	2011-08-13	2	2	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2Z31J0240AG8X	Echo	"Let me start by saying that this film degrades REAL opera singers.I found myself laughing and cringing to no end when Carlotta gets dissed for singing Think of Me in an operaticstyle -however exaggerated it is- yet when Chrissy sings the song everyone stops what they're doing and slip into a trance.  I mean even the phantom aka ""musical genius"" himself disses Carlotta's pipes over Christine's peanut vendor sound.Oh but clearly choir girl's lowered octave rendition is far more superior to that of the opera's leading soprano. Puh-leaze!I don't care if this flick wasn't meant to be an opera from the start, Christine is supposed to be an operagoddess not some poor excuse for a soprano with a very limited range.  After all, she has been coached by theso called angel of music since her childhood.  I take issue with the fact that most people who've seen this film actuallybelieve that Rossum's synthetic squealing is what's called opera.  Pre-pubescent girls mostly have this moronicmisconception.  ""LAK ZOMG EMMY ROSSUM SINGS BETTER OPERA THAN SARAH BRIGHTMAN!!!!!@1111!""  ""ZZOMGZ! SHES LAK TEH BEST SAPRANO EVA!!111Opera singers are like the superheroes of music/voice (atleast in my humble opinion) and a voice like Rossum's beingcoined ""operatic"" is shameful, distasteful, and degrading to people with such amazing talent. Stop calling heran opera singer people, this chick is most definitely an alto.  I enjoyed listening to her lower register morethan when she was straining for those high notes which clearly she wasn't ready to sing.  Her acting? umm, I didn'tsee any acting.  All I saw was the same deer-caught-in-the-headlights expression, wide eyes, gaping mouth, she lookedpractically stoned, not mesmerized...but then again Butler's voice isn't the mesmerizing type.  Rossum has a decent voice, but it isn't Christine quality.The Phantom.  One thing is certain, Butler CAN act.  He exudes passion, sensuality, and he's menacing.I missed something though, why WAS he hiding down there in the first place?  it certainly couldn't be becauseof his hot deformity.  Maybe it wasn't because of his third degree sunburn after all. Perhaps he wasjust some reject wannabe composer/musician who didn't have the right chops to make it in the music industry. So,he resorted to hiding beneath an opera house (of all freakin' places) and try to charm some dim-witted choir girl in hopes she'd fall for his ""bad boy"" side.  Yeah cause all us girls prefer the bad boy rugged type. Pfft. Spare me the bull [...] of ALW saying that the phantom had to be ""a bit rough and dangerous"" with a ""rocky type quality to his voice"".  This isn't Phantom of the Opera Superstar for crying out loud!  The Phantom is supposed to be a freak of nature.  Amazingly doted in the arts of architecture, magic, ventriloquism, and what's even more important, MUSIC and VOICE.  He is by no means supposed to be a freakin' Adonis.  He hides down there because of his FACE not his lack of musical talent.  Christine is enraptured by his genius, mystery -not his overwhelming scottish masculinity- but she also fears him. There was nothing to fear about this phantom, heck Christine is an idiot (something that most people who watch this film inevitably think, when they shouldn't) for dissing him over...Raoul. Charming voice, but Fabio isn't the musical genius here. Neither is he the lonely choir girl coached by the so called musical genius.  Maybe the real Erik hides inside Raoul's closet, that sure would explain why Raoul has better vocal talent than phantom and Chrissy combined.  He's also very handsome but that's as far as it goes.  Wilson may be a broadway actor with a charming voice, but a film actor he is not.  Well hedefinitely didn't show any acting skills in this flick.  He lacked any emotion/passion whatsoever, and the wig just made it worse. Unbearable even.oh yeah, because I dissed all three actors I'm obviously jealous of Rossum's amazing operatic talent, Butler's rockstar abilities and sensuality, and Raoul's hair. AHA. HaHaHaHa.What's the deal with Chrissie wearing a replica of one of Empress Sissi's hand-me-downs anyway?Where are all the dazzling colors so dearly emphasized in the Masquerade song?Why is madame giry the only one with a french accent, when everyone else seems to have gone british in 19th century France?Why does everyone gasp when the phantom's hot deformity is revealed?The movie doesn't suck completely though, the cinematography is quite splendid.  Minnie Driver is enjoyable in the roleof La Carlotta.  Butler is great eyecandy for the ladies.  Rossum is great eyecandy for the guys.  There are alotof statues of naked gold women.  There is somewhat of an erotic atmosphere to the whole film actually. *gasp* but of course! thisis the same director who ordered nipples to be placed on the outside of Batman's costume...""make it sexy Gerry!"" *hurls*It's very sad that the lead roles were cast more in accordance to their appearances in a film whose sole messageis 'beauty lies within' and contains the word O-P-E-R-A.  I don't get why the screen tests required them to sing at all when they were gonna get the parts anyway based on their marketable looks. Young, pretty, sopranos are a dime a dozen though, and all you needed was some 30 year old tenor for your phantom.  Oh but the flick has to appeal to the younger audiences, so we're just gonna cast some pretty chick who can sing the role of opera goddess Christine decently in a popera style.  We'll cast Gerard Butler as the phantom because he's incredibly beautiful, and we can synthesize his horrid shrilling.  Let's make it sexy and oh so marketable. After all, half of the audience aren't entirely familiar with the term opera, it'll be lak so easy! Complete. Bull.I blame Joel for this disaster, ALW is simply weak like his henchman or something.

The music stayed in my mind for days and now I have the CD so I can listen anytime I like.I was awed with the beauty of the sets, the attention to detail in the costumes which were elegant, and the emotion and passion from the actors drew me into their world for the whole 2 hours and 20 minutes.  I didn't want it to end. In fact, I have had to see it 4 more times. It seems to engage me at the level of my own desire to love and be loved.  We, at some time in our lives, may experience rejection, hurt and betrayal and maybe even feel a little inferior to others.  All this worked to draw me into the story of these characters even at my grandmotherly age!In fact, the matinees that I attend seem to be evenly divided between the young high school students who are being introduced to something like opera since there are 3 parts of ""operas"" as part of the movie, and retired folks like me.When the movie ends, there is complete silence for awhile.

The movies stands on it own as being a rather good musical. Only one complain here, and it's one that has already been made a hundred times. Although Gerard Butler is a very good actor, he cannot sing very well. BUt oh well I did not let that bother, cause I enjoyed the movie on so many different aspects. The scene at the top of the opera house is very well done. Emmy Rossum is a great singer, she is just as good if not better than most Christine's i've seen in the play. Patrick Wilson cans also sing ve well and he did a fine job. But the real mastermind behind this movie was mr Schumacher, who translated the play in to this beautiful movie.	4.0	Catchy	2005-08-18	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A13E0ARAXI6KJW	Ed Uyeshima	"The inarguable victory of this 2004 film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's record-breaking stage hit is the artistry behind the elaborate sets, which can be credited primarily to art director Anthony Pratt and set decorator Celia Bobak. Otherwise your enjoyment of the film will depend on how much you love Lloyd Webber's music and the rapt romanticism at the heart of the old Gaston Leroux story. Personally, I much prefer the sheer musicality of Rodgers and Hammerstein, the razzle-dazzle of Ebb and Kander or the incisive witticism of Sondheim before giving a listen to Lloyd Webber's mostly overwrought work. His personal stamp is so indelible here that director Joel Schumacher's chief role seems to be to not get in the way with his own well-known commercially driven and often artistically deprived instincts.Regardless, I have to give credit to Lloyd Webber for his original inspiration to transform a standard horror story with Freudian implications into a swooning romantic operetta. On that level, the story succeeds in both live and filmed versions. Unfortunately, the journey from stage to screen is far more problematic beginning with the 1980's-sounding musical arrangements which severely date the movie. Surprisingly, no effort was made to update the sound of several musical numbers that have insistent electronic drum beats more fitting in a Studio 54-type venue. Another problem is the black-and-white framing device set in 1919 that Schumacher uses to treat the 1870-set story like a memory flashback. This technique is overused not only at the beginning and the end but at various unnecessary points throughout the film. Moreover, the movie feels overlong at 143 minutes, as Schumacher's storytelling feels lethargic and oddly underdeveloped, especially when compared to a live performance. There is a feeling of endlessness during the final stretch that proves exhausting despite the melodramatic resolution.Casting is also a challenge here but not because the three leads, all talented singers, are relative newcomers to films. Gerard Butler has the unenviable task of attempting to eradicate Michael Crawford's legendary stage performance as the Phantom. He is a rather lunkish presence for such a dashing, shadowy figure, and as a singer, he is somewhat of a shouter unable to display much emotional nuance. Butler becomes more effective in the final act but merely because he seems liberated after his character's unmasking. As the pursued Christine, Emmy Rossum is a lovely presence with a bright, bell-like soprano singing voice. Interestingly though, she is more successful as an actress than a singer here since her arias feel somewhat vacuous and worse, start to feel repetitive as the movie goes on. Patrick Wilson - memorable as the closeted Joe Pitt in Mike Nichols' ""Angels in America"" - has the looks and voice to play Raoul effectively, but he seems misguided here as his character alternates between heroism and vengeance in a mercurial fashion that should be reserved for the Phantom.Far more effective in supporting roles are  Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry, the woman who seems to know all the secrets; Ciar&aacute;n Hinds and Simon Callow as Firmin and Andre, the new owners of the Opera House; and Minnie Driver at her most flamboyantly comical as the reigning opera diva Carlotta speaking a most unrecognizable Neapolitan accent. Ultimately, the Baroque nature of the film's story, coupled with its gothic setting, still feels at odds with the Broadway-style musical numbers with the exception of the lovely rooftop duet between Rossum and Wilson on ""All I Ask of You"", as beautiful a ballad to come from Lloyd Webber as any of his other hits. At the same time, those who were enthralled with the stage version should find enough to please them with this version. For me, it was simply an underwhelming experience."	3.0	Opulent But Short-Sighted Adaptation of the Love-It-or-Hate-It Andrew Lloyd Webber Hit	2005-12-26	7	4	3

The ONLY way to pull off the story's transfer from stage to screen is to involve fully capable vocalists in the principal roles.the two young lovers (christine and Raoul) did an admirable job, especially Raoul. But as for Gerard Butler [Phantom]..... whoever cast him should be shot.There are SO MANY actors out there who could pull off the role... why on earth they cast someone who couldn't sing to save their lives, I don't know.as a movie, it's beautiful. but if you have any background in voice or musical theatre, spare yourself.	2.0	NOT SO GREAT	2005-01-16	9	2	7

Teti ""etalian2"""	"If this film were to be given one millionth the pre publicity that the ""Star Wars"" films get, it would probably have been a box office triumph.  It is flawless!  The film opened with NO advance publicity.  I think the producers thought the film would sell itself.  It did, but not to the momentum needed to recoup its 90 million dollar investement.  How shocking that a crude, toilet humor film like ""Meet the Fockers"" could earn a quarter of a billion dollars shows what type of world we live in.If I see one more review on this version of Phantom that mentions M. Crawford and S. Brightman, I will scream.  Why is it always the original interpretations are the best?  If Phyllys Diller and Bob Hope had been the originals, would they be wanted for the film?  Give me a break.  Sarah Brightman's casting in the play was nepotism, period!  She stank!!!!! Crawford was fine but the dozens after him were as good if not better!  The stage musical is all spectacle and no emotion.  The film makes you feel for the characters.  Every frame is a work of art.  Emma Rossum is stunning.  Gerald Butler reaks of sexuality and is a fine actor.  Whatever happend to just being entertained at the movies?

Ms Rossum had a decent voice, but I felt it was a bit too thin to really blow me away. I'm not familiar with any of her other work, but she managed to go through the entire Phantom movie with only one facial expression. There was absolutely no emotion whatsoever.(Whenever I saw her I kept thinking of the Latina woman in the Chorus Line movie).The guy who did Raoul had a decent singing voice, probably the best of them all, but he did look completely redicilous with this long hair and sideburns.The Phantom....OH COME ON! Could they have cast a person with LESS singing talent??? He shouts through most of the movie, and when he attempts to sing it's totally off key. Angel of music my ass.And why on earth did he wear a mask?? The man was a hunk, not a horrible disfigured freak.Although the set was impressive I felt that the whole thing was a bit ""too Hollywood"", and certainly a far cry from the original novel."	1.0	What a disappointment!	2005-06-25	29	13	16

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3Q524S1DGUQNT	elionwy18	"Personally, I love the musical the Phantom of the Opera. I was ecstatic when I heard about the movie version. At last I would be able to watch my favorite musical without having to spend ridiculous amounts of money to see it in the theatre.I saw the movie, and it was enjoyable, but it was not the musical. There was something missing. Aside from the phantom being truly terrible in all ways, including voice, I was disappointed about the lack of mystery. I hated the way Joel Schumacher assumed we wanted to see how the phantom made all his  magic tricks happen. It ruins the mystery and mystique of the whole film. In the musical, we don't know how the chandelier fell, it was magic. We were stunned when Carlotta couldn't sing, it was magic. We were astonished when the piano started playing by itself, it was magic. Schumacher has wanted so much to make this character a sympathetic figure that he has lost its mystery and its magic.I was all for casting the great Michael Crawford as the phantom. Besides having an amazing voice, he would be about the right age, according to the book. Leroux implies that the phantom is an older man, so it would work. Instead, Schumacher casts this loser who sounds like a mixture between a dying cat and the backstreet boys. Terrible, absolutely terrible.Schumacher did a few other things wrong too. The phantom was not ugly in the movie! I didn't understand it. He was supposed to be so hideously deformed that his mother would scream when she saw him, but now he looks like he just has a swollen eye! Come on, use the stage makeup, it's better.But I digress. I'm recommeding the DVD because there's a very interesting documentary about the making of the show. And some parts of the movie are pretty cool. The first and last parts, namely, and some of the parts behind the scenes in the opera house were very interesting. I hated how they ruined Masquerade, first by making the costumes all black and white, then by trying to impersonate Titanic with the upper and lower classes celebrating, and lastly, but most importantly, by changing the costume of the phantom. I loved that stage costume with the skull mask, and I'm not the only one. Oh well.All in all, a good effort. But if you want a phantom, don't listen to Gerald Butler. Turn off the sound and watch the movie, but play Michael Crawford in the background. Butler's ""singing to bring down the chandelier."" Michael Crawford will save you from a headache."	3.0	A good try	2005-05-31	10	4	6

I am already a big fans of Phantom, but after watching the bonus disc, I appreciate the movie even more.  I really wish I could be part of it.On the bonus disc, the only complaint I have is that they do not have subtitle like in the first disc; in my opinion, they should at least have the subtitle for the deleted scene where the Phantom was singing the song 'No One Would Listen'.  Without the subtitle, I have no idea what he was singing about.

However, a short time after listening to the movie, I picked up the original London cast album.  Now that is beautiful.  In listening to the London, Broadway, and Broadway touring shows, I hear just how lacking the main characters in the movie were.  The singing just was not up to the standards of the stage show.  Not even close.Gerard Butler, an extremely attractive man, did not fit as the phantom.  The character should look old and disfigured, not young with a slight burn-looking scar on his face.I consider Emmy Rossum a very talented actress, but not a singer.  Her voice lacked the maturity and the operatic tone that Christine should have.  Yes, she was young, but there are plenty of young girls who can sing opera a great deal better.  I should know; that's around the area in which I am studying, and I am as young as she was.I would recommend this movie to people who aren't picky about singing.  As for people who know great voices and great opera and/or musical theatre, you may be a bit irritated.  It is a very pretty movie, though.

Residing in the depths of a grand opera house, he haunts its occupants and leaves behind his original opera scores in exchange for money.  Early in the story, he hears the voice of a chorus-girl, Christine, and becomes infatuated and obsessed.  While he attempts to woo her by passing himself off as her ""angel of music"" and tutoring her, Christine's newly acquired fame ignites her love affair with an old acquaintance and crush named Raul.  Simultaneously, the prima donna of the scene, Carlotta, whines about her recent absence of renown in the operas.  The plot, made famous on Broadway by Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, sells itself.  Webber's 2005 film adaptation of his masterpiece has earned bittersweet reviews - and rightfully so.  Despite its visual opulence and musical brilliance, there is lack of talent in the singing; and lack of believability in the acting.Visually and cinematically, the film is a work of art - somewhat comparable to the recent extravagant hit in the same genre, Moulin Rouge.  The main opera theatre was spectacular and the first class costuming and effects were entertaining to the fullest.  In the opening scene, the opera house is old, rundown, and items are dully being auctioned off inside.  The scene, which begins in black and white, soon is the site of a dramatic flashback.  With the uncovering of the famous crashed chandelier, the theatre is splashed with color and youth as time is rewound before viewers' eyes.  Cobwebs disintegrate, dust clears, and light and vibrancy wash over the seats, up the sculptured walls, and across the rotunda's painted ceiling.  Finally, the chandelier reassembles, rises up to its rightful position, and, thus, the story begins.  One can be assured this same amazement for the duration of the film.That is the `-sweet' part of the ""bittersweet"".  This is the `bitter-':  The leads' voices and acting are below average.  With the exception of Raul, who remarkably performs and interprets ""All I Ask of You"", the cast was weak in this area.  Christine, the story's center of attention, displays a pretty, yet average tone and resonance.  The sound is nasal and her vocal breakpoint lies well below her high-most notes.  The Phantom's voice is, sadly, difficult to endure.  His shaky tone, his lack of genuine vibrato, his inability to produce a steady high-pitched sound; all are detrimental to the film.  Carlotta's voice was sung by an additional voice and dubbed in.  The Phantom's voice should have been replaced, as well; along with Christine.  Not only was Carlotta's voice excellent due to an operatic soprano voice-over, but Minnie Driver stole the show by owning her role.  An excellent actress and believable diva, Driver made the audience grovel at her feet along with the cast.The symphonic and choral recordings were phenomenal.  Phrasing and emphasis augmented the acting at great levels.  However, due to the lack of greatness within the cast, the chorus and symphony were often noticeably louder during the soloist's performances.  When background music needs to disguise performances, let alone recordings, there is most definitely something that needs to be changed.  The decision to have the majority of the cast sing their own roles was nowhere near as successful as 2002's rendition of the Broadway hit, Chicago.Character development was more evident and interesting in the film than in the Broadway show.  A film offers a more in-depth view of each of the characters through close-ups, added lines, and expansion of settings.  The fairytale storyline provides leeway for believability.  It also calls for a good, attention-seeking pace.  Not only are the film's scenes tedious, but so are the orchestral and vocal arrangements.  The music is considerably slower in the film, which can be used to enhance emotion and inflection.  However, the actors failed to take the required ownership."	4.0	"""Phantom of the Opera"" OMP is decent..."	2005-04-04	5	1	4

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A31EPBIH8W4X5T	"eponine ""ebon"""	"I loved this film!! It was exreamly beautiful and well made. Although, one thing got on my nerves: the characters would speak a sung part then burst into song. But, I thought the casting was well done. Emmy Rossum played a very innnocent, young Christine. I don't really like the character Christine, but I kind of liked her in this version. Patrick Wilson played a very good Raoul both vocally and in how he acted. I am by no means a Raoul fan, but I do have to say that he did well. Minnie Driver was a perfect Carlotta. She cracked me up!!! I love her accent and aditude. Now, some may disagree, but I thought Gerard Butler played a very obsessed Phantom. Michael Crawford has a great voice, but Gerard Butler has tons of emotion. Like in ""The Music of the Night"" and ""All I ask of You reprise"". But ""The Point of No Return"" was so full of lusty/sad emotion becuase he knew that this would never work.The swordfight was kind of lame. I love swords, but having the Phantom loose to wimpy Raoul? That's just wrong. Plus, the Phantom is supposed to be UGLY. This Phantom was so young and hot that I couldn't figure out why Christine choose Raoul. Even with his mask off, he was hot. I don't see how he could be called ""The Devil's Child"" when it looked like he just had some wrinkles or a slight burn on the area around his right eye.But the ending scene, when the older Raoul, visits Christine's grave, he sees a rose and a ring. The rose was identical to the ones the Phantom gave her and the ring was the wedding ring the Phantom gave her too. Then Raoul looked to the middle of the graveyard and I expected to see the Phantom pop out, but he didn't. That was a little dissapointing."	5.0	Amazing	2005-06-23	3	2	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1IYP6QZ4UQ13J	"Erica K. Banas ""Nycshoppergirl621"""	I saw this movie on Christmas Eve and I was in awe from the moment the movie started until the very end. The two hours went by so quickly, most of the time during a movie I check my watch to see what time it is, and I didn't even do that once. I have seen the play twice and think that the movie version is better than what I saw on the stage. I think newcomer Gerard Butler does a fantastic job as the Phantom, and in some parts of his singing it reminds me of Michael Crawford who originated the Phantom on Broadway. I have to say I was fortunate to see Michael Crawford perform, not as the Phantom, but when he did the songs from the show reminds me a lot of what I saw on the screen. I have seen the Phantom played two different ways, as a villian, which is what the character is all about, and romantic, like Michael Crawford played it, and I will tell you Gerard Butler played the phantom the way Michael did.You will not be disappointed with this movie, it is defintely on my list to buy when it comes out on DVD. The special effects to me are better in the film than on stage. I think Joel Schumacker did this movie justice, not only to the author of the book, but to Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber as well. I even own the movie and stage soundtrack,trust me you will love this film as much as I did.	5.0	Excellent, Loved this film, better than the stage	2005-01-05	4	3	1

My wife and I have seen Phantom at the Baltimore Hippodrome and Her Magesty's Theatre in London so we've got a bit of ""Phantom experience"".

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AT39LPA3KDYPD	E. Riego	"As a child I grew up watching both Italian and English musicals/operas on video and had the privilege of attending several on stage performances. Sadly, as should be expected, many of the movie productions shined a very dim light in comparison to their luminous live counterparts. However, this is not the case with The Phantom of the Opera. After seeing the play, reading the original novel by Gaston Leroux, and another interpretational novel by Susan Kay, I was anxious to see how the power of film would affect this literary and musical masterpiece. Upon watching the movie with my ever-movie-going cousin, I am overjoyed to announce that this film will live in my memory forever, and that the DVD will be proud addition to my collection.Removing all the musical and historical aspects, the film is a beautiful example of skilled cinematography; they way director Joel Schumacher gracefully changed from a black and white present to a colored past was striking and breathtaking. His use of the Vicomte de Chaney (Patrick Wilson) as a link between the times not only adds to the minor character's importance, but provides a mysterious twist to the end of the story, leaving the audience thirsty for the answer to the burning question ""What happened to the Phantom?"" Furthermore, the casting, although there have been some negative reviews based on the use of certain actors or the lack thereof, was perfect: Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum) was the ideal image of childish innocence and womanly passion, she was able to draw the reader into an otherwise wimpy character and show the strength of her love for Raul the Vicomte de Chaney (Patrick Wilson) who matches Gaston Leroux's original description of a love sick, pampered, youth...And what can I say of the Phantom (Gerard Butler)?! Aside from his dashing good looks and alluring personality, he is a great actor who perfectly fit the mold of a possessive and domineering admirer/teacher. Sporting a mask that covers half his face, he stalks about the Paris Opera House wreaking havoc on those who disobey his order, while showing such care for the young Christine that fill the audience with compassion. although I have read some reviews that question Schumacher's choice of such an actor, I believe that if some RESEARCH is done (read Gaston Leroux's original novel) one finds that the Phantom has more enthralling qualities that cannot be accurately expressed on film, so bodily perfection had to compensate for literary imagination (and trust me he had ALL my attention).And the music, which remained virtually unchanged from the original d&eacute;but of 1986 London musical, is ""in a word sublime""! (As the Phantom would say). Andrew Lloyd Webber's masterpiece was brought to new life by the powerful voices of Rossom, Butler, and Wilson who sung beautifully in duets, singles, and all-cast pieces. Although not the original voices of Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, these novel voices have an alluring quality of their own (and make the soundtrack a worth while purchase).All in all, The Phantom of the Opera is a must see for phantom fanatics and romantics everywhere, a worthwhile viewing for good movie watchers. And although it is not a perfectly, direct, flawless, identical reproduction of the Broadway play, it is (as previous reviewer stated) ""a welcome exception to the long line of ill-conceived Broadway-to-movie travesties."""	5.0	A testemony to the gift of creative genius	2006-08-07	8	7	1

Scenery, props, costuming... wonderful.I wish I had never seen it!!!The magic and mystery is killed as soon as the Phantom's mask is pulled of the first time, and it never recovers.  I cried with a broken heart after seeing the movie.  I am so in love with this play, but I cannot believe that the director chose youth over the neccesary maturity needed for the roles.  Emmy has a beautiful voice... she's just not old enough for the part.  Raoul is far too young.  It's a joke.  The Phantom needs to SING!  Gerald Butler... he's not good enough.I pray that I can forget the trapdoors shown in the movie, and return myself to the magic world in the stage show.  I feel like a child told that there is no Santa.I'm buying the DVD for one reason... the opening sequence, which I will watch over and over again.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2ZUL7I0ATUTN	"E. Roberts ""towelgirl21"""	"I was glued to the screen when I watched ""Phantom of the Opera"" and here's my review. (No Spoilers Included)The open-ended one sentence summary: A young protege actress is taught by a mysterious Angel of Music, who's beginning to make demands of everyone...Content Inappropriate for All Ages: Some mild bad language, a few skimpy costumes, violent and disturbing scenes, deformities, a scene of mooning, scenes of seduction, themes of possesion.Characters: 4 of 5 stars. Some amazing acting in this, I thought. The Phantom and Christine were cast well. (The girl playing Christine was only 16 when this was filmed!) You feel for the Phantom, and understand Christine's temptation. Minnie Driver as Carlotta was really funny. My only complaint was that Patrick Wilson was a little too soft-faced and perfect-looking for his part.Plot: 5 of 5 stars. Enough plot to analyze, but not enough to get lost in. There's lots of intrigue, musical numbers, action, pathos, and romance. The end result of the story is very powerful. It's easy to see why this is such a beloved musical on Broadway.Cinematography: 4 of 5 stars. I couldn't see it all because I was watching a full-screen DVD, but I could tell that the sets were well crafted and the lighting excellent. Love the candles.Music: 5 of 5 stars. One of the most important parts of a musical. (Duh!) The songs and underscoring perfectly capture the essence of the movie. I found it to be memorable and exciting, though all the songs kind of melded to be indistinguishable one from the other.Impact: 5 of 5 stars. Let me first say that I was totally unfamiliar with the plot, and I hate opera in general. That doesn't stop a good movie, though. I got heavily involved in this movie, and it was almost a tear-jerker. The end leaves you wondering a little, and given the movie, I didn't mind. I thought about this movie long after I watched it. The Phantom of the Opera is inside of my mind now.All in all, 4.5 of 5 stars."	5.0	Review: Phantom of the Opera	2006-07-03	1	1	0

Learning for us is a thrill, and having subtitles that we can read allows us to understand, sing along, and deeply internalize messages. The Phantom of the Opera provides a magnificent tale of love, tragedy, and the perennial struggle between good and evil. A ghost terrorizes those that work or visit a French Opera House. But at the same time, this ghost tutors a chorus girl to sing like an angel. His angel of the night. By driving the leading soprano crazy, he is able to encourage that his prot&eacute;g&eacute; be center stage. And she renders a brilliant performance. Phantom loves her, but Christine does not return his affection. Falling in love with the Vicomte de Chagny, Christine breaks Phantom's heart. As we read the lyrics of each and every song... we are marveled at the magnificent story told through the most beautiful music ever.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1N7YA81ZI4KAF	"E. Valero ""Eterno"""	"""The Phantom of the Opera"" (2004) is a visually spectacular film which remains loyal to the stage production despite some changes to the characters and story. The set design and costumes are sumptuous and Webber's music is beautiful..The cast, for the most part is excellent. The standout performer is Emmy Rossum who gives an praise worthy performance as the young soprano Christine Daa&eacute;. Although her voice is no match to the others who have played the role on stage such as the sublime Rebecca Caine, Sierra Boggess, Rebecca Luker, Claire Moore to name a few it is still lovely. Her tone is delicate and sweet (""Angel of Music"") and at times powerful (the cadenza at the end of ""Think of Me"") and many times throughout the score, she achieves moments of great vocal beauty (the rooftop scene). She breezes through most of the score effortlessly with a few exceptions (there are moments of strain during the ""Think of Me"" and during the Phantom's ""Point of No Return""). I always keep in mind that she is probably one of the youngest sopranos to ever perform these songs. All the other (stage) Christine's have been at least 10 years older than Miss Rossum and to have someone this young sing these songs is impressive as the score calls for the singer to jump octaves and sing high B's,  C's and E's (in this case an E flat). Her physical presence is also worth noting. Physically she is the perfect Christine as her age and look is suited well for the role. Admittedly, I have not read the original novel but I am suspecting Ms. Daa&eacute; of Leroux's imagination was close in age to Rossum. If not, she should have been, as it is far more believable to have a young girl, not yet reaching true maturity, succumb to the Phantom's influence.The title role was given to Gerard Butler who gives a strong dramatic performance but vocally, he is the weakest singer in the bunch. His voice is still competent in parts but many will argue a Phantom with a weak voice is not believable to which they have a point since it is he who teaches Christine how to sing however, like in Rossum's case and since film is a different medium, suspension of disbelief must come into play. If not, the hard-nosed critic will most likely have a difficult time listening to Butler struggle with most of the score. Another distraction that may or will arise is Butler's looks since his Phantom looks more of a Harlequin romance version and not the grotesque creature originally portrayed in the novel or the countless horror films the book inspired. Since this is the musical ""Phantom"" and not the horror-esque version of the 20's, 40's, 60's and 80's, it works for me. He is not suppose to scare the pants off the audience. If it's scares you want then I suggest you stick with Lon Chaney. Lloyd Weber's Phantom is suppose to seduce the audience and make the audience sympathize with him and Mr. Butler succeeds. Webber himself has stressed in earlier interviews that what attracted him to this piece was the romance, not the hokey horror tale. So while other versions focus on the horror, this one focuses on the romance.Others in the cast include Patrick Wilson who turns in a solid performance as the love-struck but rather wooden Raoul. His voice is good yet his character remains the least sympathetic despite the film-makers attempt to make him more interesting than his stage counterpart. Minnie Driver's over-the-top but hilarious portrayal of the diva and Christine rival ""La Carlotta"" is a scene stealer. Driver was the only cast member who did not do her own singing.Directed by the now infamous-for-putting-nipples-on-Batman-Joel Schumacher, the film is an assault on the senses. The elaborate sets, the glittering costumes, the cinematography are all spectacular and beautiful to behold and Webber's score is gorgeous. Many of Webber's simplest tunes turn out to be his most beautiful works. In the case here, the hauntingly beautiful ""Angel of Music"" is a standout. This song is repeated throughout the musical and the lovely tune is enhanced by Rossum's delicate soprano and fantastic orchestrations. Other musical highlights include the title track (although many have expressed disappointment in the omission of the last verse), the energetic ""Masquerade"", the lovely duet ""All I Ask of You"" (which is spectacular on film) and the Phantom's opera ""Don Juan Triumphant"" followed by what many call one of Webber's best tunes ""Point of No Return"".The film was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Song and Best Art Direction at the 2005 Oscars. It also received 3 Golden Globes nominations (including Best Picture), 2 Critics Choice award nominations (including Best Picture) and 11 Golden Satellite Awards nominations (including Best Picture). Although the film did not win any of the major awards Emmy Rossum won the National Board of Review Award for her performance in the film, as well as a Critics Choice award which was well deserved.The 2 disc DVD contains a making of documentary which is interesting enough, the theatrical trailer and if you do some investigative work, you should discover an easter egg. The one disc DVD's contain only the trailer as an extra.For the millions of fans who have not experienced Schumacher's vision of Andrew Lloyd Webbers musical, do not hesitate. It is a glorious production that does the stage show justice despite some cast controversy and narrative changes. It is a remarkable documentation of the show and as a movie musical, it is almost perfect. Musical theatre has never been this spectacular."	5.0	Face the Music.

Thought the choice of people who played the various roles to be superb, understanding that the cast from the original musical was excellent as well. As far as the story itself goes, it was well presented, the music was incredible - & the end scenes one unexpected occurrence after the other. I also found Erik's experiences as a child to be horrific, finding myself praying that there was hope for his tormented, lonely soul after the end of the scene in his lair. I do enjoy musicals when they are well done, & this was the best of the best, being a truly magnificent production.	5.0	A Breathtaking Masterpiece	2009-04-18	2	2	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1P6MKKYNSMCML	Fast Forward	"I have read most of the other reviews on this page. They run the gamut from begrudging tolerance to a downright obnoxiously snotty kid's review.  So why all the poison?  People usually act this way when they're discussing politics or religion.  What the heck's going on here?Something amazing. Most people come away from this work deeply impressed, moved and transformed for LIFE. They feel it is THEIR musical. It is a totally personal, life-changing revelation. It MUST always be the way they experienced it the first time. Hence all the negative rhetoric about the film not being enough of this or that, as opposed to the original cast stage version.Not all musicals achieve such status. Chances are ""Phantom"" will touch you as deeply as it did me.Perhaps you will feel as I did when you see this DVD...that the music and singing are glorious, you will feel that the songs were always a part of you, that the camera seems to lovingly caress every sumptuous set and costume,  that the story is poignant and moving beyond tears.The film is stunning on its OWN terms. I for one love it (yes, in spite of having seen the stage production and loving it too.)  Let the crabby-appletons out there grouse their heads off.

A picture is worth a thousand words.  The music is in my head and I don't want it to go away.  Gerard Butler is hopefully launched.  I can't imagine anyone better in the role as the Phantom.

Everything about the film is great.  The music is so haunting and the cast does a great job.  Gerald Butler is the best Phantom ever.  He portrays the part very well.  The Phantom is an insane murderer, but at the same time he has feelings.  The scene where the Phantom sees Christine and Raoul together singing ""All I Ask Of You"" is very touching.  To see him cry over Christine because he loves her so much is enough to make anyone cry, too.  I'm sure Gerald Butler has made every female who has seen the film fall in love with him.  He is indeed a very sexy and handsome Phantom compared to the others who have played the role (sorry guys)."	5.0	Great Film - Best Phantom Ever!	2005-02-18	17	16	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2460LM4OOYVI9	Flabbadydoo	I loved the play and saw it several times.  I was happy to hear that it was being filmed and hoped that it would prove to be a comeback for the Hollywood musical, but so many bad decisions were made it hard to know how to begin.  Let's start with the casting.  The guy who played the phantom was terrible.  He couldn't sing!  Maybe if you've never seen or heard Michael Crawford you might think him adequate, but his voice just couldn't do justice to the music. End of story.  The play and original story had a lot of supernatural elements such as Christine walking through the mirror and the magical lasso that hung in the middle of the air.  Part of the fun was wondering how the phantom did these things.  In the movie all this was explained away.  Christine finds the mirror to be a sliding glass door of all things.  The phantom was way too good looking. He is supposed to be scary and hideous in appearance. He is just a handsome guy with a mask.  When you do finally see him it is underwhelming.  He just isn't scary enough.  By taking away the horror and supernatural elements we are just left with a love triangle. Combine that with some of the cepiatone filming and it takes on the feel of a cheap harlequin romance novel.  These changes, though small, have a great significance.  All the fun and profundity are absent.  There are many good performances and the score is well done, beautiful sets and costumes...When I think of how good it should have been.  I have to scratch my head.  What fools!Don't mess with perfection. And get a phantom who is scary and can sing!	2.0	Disappointing	2008-05-07	4	3	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3IKBHODOTYYHM	"fra7299 ""fra7299"""	"This was a brilliant version of Phantom of the Opera. I have never seen the actual stage presentation of the musical, so this was a treat to watch in on the big screen. Like many of the other reviewers, I felt like this adaptation of the musical pulls off the big screen feel that this work should have.Another reason this version thrives is that the movie did not diminish or impede LeRoux's original novel. This could have been another lame attempt by Hollywood to take a story from a novel and ""dumb"" it down, adding unnecessary plot details and overdone scenes. Thankfully that didn't happen, and the gothic/ horror feel is depicted successfully.The singing is superb and I felt like the movie was well cast. Emmy Rossum exerts a successful job as Christine Daae and Gerard Butler does as well also as the Phantom. With the way the film is produced and directed, it is not hard to ""get into"" the head of specific characters.Sometimes it is the small aspects that make movies a grade better than the rest. The way the producers used the black and white screen to flash ahead to another time at the movie's outset, and then periodically go back to this, was uniquely satisfying, and helps the story along. It also made the transitions back into LeRoux's story even more effective. Also, the cinematography and visual effects aid in exemplifying the essential themes of the story: love, hate, jealousy, inner beauty, despair, isolation, hope. These all come forth in the grand chandelier scene, the cemetery scene with Christine, the isolation of the Phantom in his chambers, and the magnificent opera scenes.Finally, there is a successful transition from Broadway musical to movie. This one does live up to the hype."	5.0	Majestic Adaptation of the Musical	2005-05-14	12	10	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2WADIGA35Q8DC	Frances M. Roberts	I would recommend this version of The Phantom of the Opera to anyone who is deeply moved by romance, pain, passion, beauty, love, and music.  Gerard Butler gives an oscar-worthy performance as the Phantom, particularly in the scene on the roof, when he picks up the rose Christine rejects, and, again, at the end, when she places the ring in his hand.  I think because he does not sing the way Michael Crawford did in the stage version, his performance in this classic Beauty and the Beast tale, minus the happy ending - at least for the beast, has been less than fully appreciated.Emmy Rossum is magical, singing and acting with equal beauty and skill.  Patrick Wilson is the perfect Raoul, brave with the sword but not always sensitive to the danger in which he places Christine.  He has a fine voice and performs the role admirably.  Miranda Richardson, head of the ballet at the opera house gives a stellar performance as keeper of the phantom's secret.  Minnie Driver, as the opera diva, and Ciaran Hines, as one of the new owners, provide humor, perfectly balancing the movies serious theme.How can anyone say enough about the power of Andrew Lloyd Webber's music.  Words are simply inadequate.  It is beyond extraordinary.  He and Joel Shumacher, as producer and director, remained true to Gaston Leroux's original novel, The Phantom of the Opera.  I cannot fathom that anyone buying this video or dvd version could be disappointed.  It is simply wonderful.Frances	5.0	A Splendid Version of Phantom of the Opera	2005-08-01	2	2	0

Therefore, I had the opportunity to see Phantom on the stage 4 times. Nothing - nothing will ever compare to seeing Michael Crawford as the Phantom.However, Gerard Butler made a fantasticly good Phantom, too. I did not always like his interpretation of what the Phantom was thinking or feeling, I grew to love him by the end of the film. Emmy Rossum was unquestionable as Christine. Raoul was a little stiff, but he pulled his part off pretty well. His voice made up for his ""wooden"" performance many times. Minnie Driver was over the top, and I did not like her in her as Carlotta. While the part is a bit of a comic relief, Minnie Driver's character made the scences a comedy.Overall, I enjoyed the movie and I have pre-ordered the DVD. The vocal talent was amazing and Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler lit up the screen. I set out to see the movie because I loved the stage version so. I expected to be dissapointed - I was not.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1OZFMJ2AD2R41	Furiae	"For those of us who just love the theatrics, lush beauty, and drama of theater, we cannot help but be mesmerized by this movie.  However, the reaction this film received in the movie theater I attended best sums up the overall reception.  About forty minutes into the film, about 4-5 people walked out of the theater.  When the movie ended, though, it received applause from the audience -- that speaks for itself because, come on, how often do you get applause anymore these days for movies?  (In Los Angeles, mind you.)Strangely enough, right after listening to the chorus of cheers, I walked out and listened to a young woman complain: ""I take back what I said about her [Emmy Rossum] sounding like a 16-year-old, she sounds like a 12-year-old.""  Personally, I wanted to take her aside and ask her whether she knew what a 'soprano' is or not, that sopranos are supposed to sing high, and the character of Christine called for a soprano... but that's a story for another day.So there you have it.  Some loved it, some hated it.  I love entertainment in all its forms and I don't really subscribe to the elitist attitudes a lot of movie snobs tend to display, so I absolutely fell in love with this gorgeous movie.  The same quote used to describe Andrew Lloyd Webber could be used here to describe his movie: ""Let's face it, no one in the world loves Andrew Lloyd Webber but the public.""  Critics and the like have a reputation for snubbing him, but still, his works appeal to those of us with more common tastes, it seems, which is just fine by me.  Even more amusing is that while Roger Ebert slammed the movie, he perplexed even himself by still recommending it towards the end of his review because of the sheer spectacle and look of the film is undeniably fantastic.The look of the film is fantastic.  It's gorgeous, the sets are gorgeous, the costumes are gorgeous, and the so are the actors.  Some may say while it's got appearance, it lacks substance, but seriously, one could have said the same for Moulin Rouge.  Both are rather simplistic stories with high-amped visuals.The movie remains rather faithful to the theater version and serves as a wonderful way to make up for not seeing Phantom on stage."	4.0	Mixed reaction in theater, but I loved it	2005-03-01	5	5	0

The film itself is spectacular, gorgeous, sparkling with the colors so powerful, images so magic and real, and melodies so...familiar.I don't know if it was the new cinema born in front of me or just a return to old good times when cinema was supposed to entertain, to take you to the Dream Worlds - someone said once that new is well forgotten old.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3CZJTONOY0E3R	G. Aquino	I was one of those who believed that there could never be another Phantom other than Michael Crawford.  How could someone musically fill his shoes?  Realistically, no one ever could.  While watching the movie, with my original skepticism, I began to realize that Gerrard Butler was not trying to be Michael Crawford's Phantom, he was creating his own.  I fell in love with Gerrard Butler's portrayal of the Phantom half way through his first song.  The way he is able to portray such incredible raw emotion is simply breathtaking..... each time he sings to Christine before becoming unmasked, my breath catches and I feel the agony that he feels, the begging for acceptance, the longing to be loved.  The way his eyes search Christine's, the pain in them, the desperation... Gerrard Butler far exceeded my expectations as Phantom. I highly recommend this DVD to everyone.  The cast is exceptional, and as always, the score is unmatchable.	5.0	Phenomenal Movie!	2005-08-28	3	2	1

I've already seen it 6 times and I'm counting the seconds until the DVD is released. I've never been tempted to go and see a musical before but I saw the trailer for this and was hugely tempted. Now this film has converted me. It looks absolutely stunning, all the performances are wonderful and damn it I just can't get the songs out of my head.They are sung with such driving emotion that you will have them swirling through your head for months.  Gerard Butler does an amazing job as the Phantom. His performance is full of passionate intensity and depth. Utterly believeable. And on a more shallow note the sight of him in an open to the chest white shirt knocks the whole Mr Darcy-emerging-from-the-lake-in-a-wet-shirt thing into a cocked hat. I nearly set fire to my seat! The only down side of the Phantoms brooding sexiness is that I just can't figure out why Christine would choose Raoul. Maybe she sneaks back to the Phantom when Raoul's not looking? Every time I see this film I find something more to love. I advise everyone to go and see it.	5.0	Best film of the year!	2005-01-09	1	1	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2HU94KJ4SUFR0	"Garrett Stiger ""Gar"""	"Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"" tells the story of a deformed musical prodigy known as the Phantom (Gerard Butler) and his haunting obsession with a young, talented ing&eacute;nue named Christine (Emmy Rossum). When the Phantom's love fantasy is threatened by Christine's childhood sweetheart (Patrick Wilson), he takes action against the opera house for which Christine performs.For many years, I have been an intense admirer of Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage production of ""The Phantom of the Opera"".  I have seen the show several times, so I was quite excited when I discovered that a film adaptation was in the works.  However, my joy gave way to dread when I learned that the heavy-handed and insipid Joel Schumacher - the filmmaker responsible for the abominable ""Batman & Robin"" - was to take charge of Andrew Lloyd Webber's cinematic opus. As the release date for ""Phantom"" neared, my anxiety was understandably heightened.  Photographs, video clips, and sound bytes hinted at a truly splendid visual and auditory experience. Pre-release critical reception was lackluster to say the least, however, and so I waited with bated breath...Having finally seen Joel Schumacher's interpretation of Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"", I can safely say that the adaptation will not disappoint fans of the musical, yet it may not wholly enthrall them nor sway those indifferent toward Webber's musical compositions. Schumacher's efforts are adequate as he remains stoutly faithful to the stage production. What minor creative liberties he allows, such as a brief glimpse into the Phantom's troubled past and an exceedingly poignant epilogue, are a welcome addition to the mythic story.However, Schumacher's stringent adherence to Webber's original storyline is one of the film's weak points. Music is justifiably a constant presence in the piece, but many lines sung on stage do not work on the silver screen. Schumacher preserves many such musical phrases, and the effect is occasionally rather silly. Additionally, his direction is both generic and without energy. As a result, the film's middle passages tend to drag. Schumacher's lack of innovation and dynamism prevent his ""Phantom"" from reaching the lofty heights of recent movie musicals like ""Moulin Rouge!"" and ""Chicago.""The lead roles of Christine and her disturbed Phantom require a great deal of emotional power and musical know-how. I am pleased to report that Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler fill the requirements of their respective roles nicely. Rossum infuses Christine with such soulfulness and innocence that it is impossible not to be swept up by her grace. She also boasts a stellar singing voice. Gerard Butler, while not nearly as musically proficient as the famed Michael Crawford who originated the role of the Phantom on Broadway, makes up for any musical inadequacies with a dynamic, raw, and volatile screen presence. He offers a refreshing interpretation of the character, instilling the Phantom with a greater sense of masculinity and menace than has been seen on the stage. The rest of the cast members range from serviceable (Patrick Wilson as Christine's childhood sweetheart) to exceptional (Miranda Richardson as the mysterious Madame Giry).The technical attributes of ""The Phantom"" are, for the most part, excellent. John Mathieson's exquisite cinematography illuminates the film with such wondrous beauty and passion. A substantial amount of money was spent on recreating Paris Opera House of yesteryear, and every dollar is evident on screen. The sets are both vast and intricate, while the costumes are dazzling and extravagant. Editor Terry Rawlings does falter as much of the film is assembled in a somewhat incoherent fashion. He often cuts from close-up to close-up, offering little establishment of the characters' spatial relationships. The effect is one of disorientation and disjointedness.Schumacher has delivered a solid adaptation of Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"", no more and no less. I enjoyed the film and that in itself is a relief given Schumacher's abysmal track record. After having seen it, however, I can't help but feel slightly disappointed that Webber's illustrious and soaring musical was not given to a more gifted director. The actors and technicians do their part, imparting both passion and romance into the production. Schumacher's efforts are sufficient, but the material is deserving of so much more. What an experience this would have been had it been helmed by renowned theater director and filmmaker, Sam Mendes (""American Beauty"", ""Road to Perdition"") or the gothic eccentric Tim Burton (""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Batman"")! ""The Phantom of the Opera"", a good film, could have been great had it been placed in more capable hands."	4.0	Let the dream begin?	2004-12-23	4	4	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AKSB6ONBMQD73	"Gary D. Ryno ""Hornless One"""	"I've had the pleasure of seeing the Phantom of the Opera by the original cast at a live performance.  I didn't think the original could be outdone, or in fact that this wonderful musical would ever be produced in a movie format that could be purchased by the public.  I have long awaited for the movie production of Chess, to no avail.  To say that I was surprised when I accidently ran across this DVD in Amazon.com is one hell of an understatement.  I never thought that it would ever happen.  After reading the previous reviews, I knew that I had to have it.I watched the DVD last evening and was totally blown away.  I agree with one other reviewer in that this production is a hundred times better than the stage production, not only because it ""connects the dots"" between the musical pieces, but it gives one a real feel of the dynamics of the story.I am going to purchase several more of these DVD's as gifts.  I suppose there are people who do not like this musical.  My father, for one, would have kicked the ends out of his casket if he would of heard this musical.I can't imagine anyone who watches this movie, not being moved to tears."	5.0	I didn't think it was possible.	2009-03-26	1	1	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3M5O6UHXO9IBU	Gary	A very good film for the most part and a tear ran down my cheek towards the end, thanks to Gerard Butler's cracking performance as the phantom. The central conceit surrounding his looks are clever, but also something of a distraction until the denouement. My eyes also watered during the cemetary scene, albeit for different reasons. Although perishingly cold, young actress Emmy Rossum did not appear bothered by the chill winds and falling snow, despite exposing her cleavege to the elements for a good ten minutes. What an amazing set. Stage set, I mean. Her performance has been criticised for a certain blandness but this sort of blandness in cold climates should be encouraged. In fact, the box office would be advised to hand out free oxygen masks and cylinders to any male who looks over sixty five. Not that Ms Rossum shows any greater propensity to decorum while indoors where she exposes her full range to her lover. And what a great vocal range it is too, although I'm no expert.The problem with this musical is that it only has the one song, beautifully sung on the opera roof, and worth the price of admission alone. The rest are mere tadpoles flapping around this moving number, although very pleasant.The story works because we all understand unrequieted love. Well, everyone except Andrew Lloyd Webber whose devastating handsomeness and success with women such as Sarah Brightman, must preclude such sentiments. It has been said of 'Moby Dick', that the whale is Melville. Likewise here, the phantom is almost certainly Webber. I suspect he has created this grand opus not as a tribute to the beauteous Brightman, but as a huge 'what if?' scenario. Indeed, what if he had not been born devastatingly handsome and irresistable to women, and had in fact been a grotesque shunned by polite society? I'm sure he enjoyed his little frisson, although for us mere mortals, the unrequieted love angle holds the most resonance. I only detonate the word 'resonance' twice a year in a built up area, and seeing as it's nearly Christmas, chocks away. Anyway, there are certainly no cracked mirrors in the Webber household.*SPOILERS*The only thing that left a bad taste in my mouth as I left the theatre is the law and order issue. Basically, the phantom is a serial killer, isn't he? Admittedly, not a very good one as he devises deadly traps that have their own escape switch, but nevertheless, he managed to chalk up a fair body count. He should have done a little time, if only to keep the prosecutor happy, rather than exit stage left. I'm sure there was plenty of forensic evidence to be found in his grotty grotto. Get CSI Paris on the case.	3.0	The phantom menace	2004-12-14	14	3	11

I was wrong, she was spectacular - I was there with her, living it!  She seemed completely enchanted by the Phantom at appropriate times, when her breathing quickened - mine did too, when she looked dreamily at him, I did too.  I probably would have made the same decision she did in the end but honestly, I can't be sure because a more compelling Phantom I can't even imagine!  Gerard Butler.  (Oh, my!  He'll probably be the new leading male actor in every movie now.  I have already ordered other movies he's been in)  I may have just tried to reform him.  What a strong actor.  I can't imagine how he could ever play a supporting actor, (except he is such a good actor I'm sure he could play anything he wanted) he is such a powerful presence (charismatic, sexy, handsome, etc.)  Patrick Wilson, of course, is the hero we all dream about.  He was the perfect knight in shining armor, fantastic voice, his acting was absolutely awesome!  I can't forget to mention Minnie Driver, what a surprise to here her sing, talk about a powerful voice!  And she was wonderfully funny, made me laugh when I was so emotionally involved with the plot and actors ""I go now, bye bye!"" and off the stage she went, with much ado.  The scenery was spectacular, the costumes were great!  When the lights when on in the theatre I was emotionally drained, so much a part of it was I.  Obviously I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys great opera, great acting, and a very sexy movie with all actors totally clothed, no lewd language or groping, which I tend to think of as fillers for poor plots anyway."	5.0	Entrancing!	2005-02-01	5	4	1

The theater, the stage, the cast.  By the way all singing was done by the main characters except for Mimi Driver.  But she too is a trained soprano and did an admirable job.  This is an old and maybe considered a little &#34;tattered and torn&#34; musical, but the tunes are haunting and beautiful.  The main character young and impressionable.  The voice of the Phantom is one we should hear more often.  Not completely perfect, but strong and perfect for the part.  Christine's voice is proven at a young age.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AAEP8YFERQ8FC	General Breadbasket	"""Phantom of the Opera"" a movie based on the musical of the same name (by Andrew Lloyd Webber), based on the book of the same name (by Gaston Leroux), where a mysterious masked figure haunts both an opera and the heart of an aspiring young soprano. I've always wanted to see Phantom of the Opera in some for or other. He's always appeared to me to be classic horror figure, like Dracula. Missed the musical, so I caught the film on DVD. I was very disappointed.Don't get me wrong. The music was nice enough, and the sets, though the whole ""looking back forty years after it had happened"" got in the way a bit. What really, really annoyed me though was the Phantom himself. He expects to be paid by the owners of the theatre, and to get nice seating for the works that play there. It's not like he once owned the theatre or anything, he just wants money.  He chooses a girl from her childhood to teach music, then wants to spoil any chance her childhood sweetheart Raoul has with her because he's going to marry her. He's a bit old for her! And the way he woos her, through trickery, lies and killing innocent people who get in his way! He's all too particular about music and how it should be performed, yet as far as I can tell has never been in an opera himself (not until near the end anyway). This all could have worked, but the way the Phantom does these things is just so ruthless, cold and spiteful, even in his romance. He comes off more like a bratty little music snob than a romantic anti-hero. I didn't feel captivated or feel sympathy for him at all. During the swordfight between the Phantom and Raoul in the cemetary, I was hoping that Raoul would kill him, actually, I was that fed up with the Phantom. Maybe it was this version of the story, maybe even it was the actor who played him (Gerard Butler). The special features (besides your standard behind the scenes stuff) include snippets of promotional footage from musicals of times past, including one with Michael Crawford as the Phantom. That Phantom seemed a lot more tormented, sensitive and likeable than the one seen in this film.The whole thing just really bugged me, which is strange, because I usually like Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals, period pieces and classic-style horror."	2.0	"""Love Me, That's All I Ask Of You"""	2006-06-05	11	0	11

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2CN3U4JCMSMA	George Khelashvili	"Finally there exists the movie version of Andrew Lloyd Weber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"". I saw the movie twice already, it is amazing. OK, singers are not exactly Sarah Brightman and Michael Crowford caliber but they are still very, very, very good and perfectly suitable for their roles. I want to emphasize on Emmy Rossum, who portrays beautiful Christine. She is an ideal, perfect match for Christine. She is dazlling!!! And she is only 17 years old. I read on the official web site of the movie that she trained her voice in her childhood at the Metropoliten Opera. At only 17 she has gorgeous voice. I guess, if she wanted, she could've succeeded as singer rather than actress. But she looks so beatifull and she is very good actress. So she is doing the right thing staying in the movie business. It would be incorrect to compare her with Sarah Brightman. I love Sarah Brightman, she is accomplished, amazing singer. But Emmy Rossum has the advantage of being young and she has the youth in her voice, which is absolutely perfect for the role of Christine. With this movie Emmy Rossum made the character of Christine immortal.Phantom and Raul are also impressive. Raul's singing is powerfull. He blends acting and singing very well. Phantom's acting is very real, and not only them, everybody's acting, all the supporting cast is brilliant. Minnie Driver, portraying Carlotte Giudicelli, is great, her acting is so funny and real and singing is very impressive.And how about this timeless music. You never get tired of listening to it. My favorite moment in the movie is defenitely ""Point of no return"". It is magical. Phantom and Christine are just unbelievable. Directing is superb. A. L. Webber himself took part in directing and so you can see. This is the kind of movie that comes maybe ones in 20 years. The last time I saw the movie that splendid and magnificent was Franco Zeffirelli's ""Traviata"". I just do not agree with all the negative reviews this movie gets. It is rediculous to compare the movie with the theatrical version. First of all, in order to appreciate show in theater you have to be very close to stage. Otherwise none of the special effects are that great, you can not see the performers clearly. I saw Phantom in the theater, and my sit was far away from the stage and guess what, I found that performance OK. However, in movie everybody gets the chance to see everything, all the facial expressions, and plus on the movie screen, obviously you can improvise more with the camera. The Phantom of the Opera is the treasure of cinematography and musical. It is defenitely in my top three movies I've ever seen.So, this movie is defenitely must see, must have (when it comes out on DVD). Although I saw the movie twice, I am dying to see it again. I might go and watch it again. If Hollywood does not give this movie an Oscar for the best movie of the 2004, it will be absolutely shocking and rediculous. It is not only the best movie of 2004, but it belongs at least to top 10 best movies in the history of cinematography."	5.0	The best movie probably you will ever see	2004-12-30	5	5	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A234L7R41ZLI3H	"ginmar ""book/digital addict"""	Gerard Butler is a very good looking actor whose appearance changes so much from role to role that it's the character that stays in your mind.  His performance here as the Phantom is an amazingly devoted and humble piece of work, as the character is stripped of his protective theatrical persona and revealed as a sorrowful loner at the end.  Butler didn't have to go for that depth in the performance, but he did, and it's an amazingly deep, detailed act.  Every gesture, every movement contributes to the portrayal; it's stunning.It's also overlooked.The filmmakers could have expanded upon the famous broadway show and given us some backstory to help us clear up the mysteries of the other characters, but they didn't. Why does Christine thnk the Phantom is her father? How, exactly, does the phantom conduct those music lessons? How old IS Raoul, and what was a boy his age doing hanging around a girl Christine's age when she was little---he had to have been an adolescent.  Who is Raoul, and what's going on there?  Waht about the war that's going on at the time?  The phantom builds up their lair under the opera---exactly how, anyway?The movie itself is visually gorgeous and if you don't take it seriously it's very enjoyable.  Minnie Driver gives a wonderfully gawdy performance as Carlotta and Simon Callow Ciaran Hinds mug it up as the managers.  The quiet standout was Msr. Reyer, the conductor, who has as few lines as the Phantom but manages to give a wonderful little performance as a musically-inclined mouse in a maestro's suit.The probelm with viewing this as camp is that Butler's performance is entirely sincere and honest, and every time you find yourself sneering at the gaudiness of it, his acting is enough to pull you up short.Patrick Wilson and Emmy Rossum play Raoul and Christine, and they were evidenlty hired for their singing. Both have fine voices, Wilson particularly so, but to be fair neither part offers much.  However, neither much tries, either.What a pity they didn't try and make something more of this than they did.	3.0	A missed opportunity and a great performance	2006-01-09	10	6	4

His rendition of Music of the Night was amazing, and I felt compelled to download it after the movie was over. Minnie Driver's character was amusing, but not much else stands out in the movie. The special effects for the movie ending were particularly cheesy.	3.0	Movie was meh, but who knew Gerard Butler could sing?!	2013-08-27	0	0	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2L5JGB78E0EA6	glenned	I loved the movie itself, but I have a HUGE problem with the fact that the sound is only dolby digital.I have no idea what is wrong with Warner Bros, but they failed to provide the superior lossless Dolby or DTS sound tracks on this disk.  The lossless sound is on the HDDVD version of this movie.  So you know that Warner Bros had already gone to the expense of creating it, before they created the B.R. version.HELLO, this is a musical.  The sound quality is of paramount importance.  I have both versions of the movie.  The HDDVD sounds much better.  When I first played the B.R. version, I could immediatly hear that something was wrong.  I never thought to check the B.R. versions stats before I bought it, or I would not have done it.My advice is to wait until they master this movie properly, then buy it.  Had I known better, that is what I would have done.	1.0	Warning:  No Loss-less sound on this disk	2010-02-15	30	20	10

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3C0DPA9ZC2MFG	Glenn Ng	"The opening sequence alone is worth the price of this DVD! The original overture is already a very powerful music piece. Adding the CGI morphing & the whole sequence transcend into THE powerful & magical sequence in the history of cinema (my humble opinion).I think Emmy Rossum is the best Christine since Sarah Brightman. Like Christine herself, this was the first major role for Rossum. So the film successfully captured her freshness, uncertainty, immature yet innocent technique, both in her role as Christine as well as her own feeling.If I like this film so much, why do I give only 3 stars? One word ""Phantom""! While Emmy Rossum is the best Christine, Gerard Bulter IS THE WORST PHANTOM! I fast forward all the scene with the ""Phantom"" solo because Gerard Bulter cannot sing! Even I can sing better then him! I believe there must be other actors in the world who can sing better, act better & good-looking. Why on earth choose one who cannot sing?! Gerard Bulter almost single-handedly destroy this film, if not the excellent performance of Emmy Rossum & other supporting cast save the day.At the end, do I recommend this film? Yes, the magical overture, the beautiful set, the voice of Miss Rossum, etc. all add up to one of the best musical movie in recent years. It is a pity that ""the Phantom"" cannot live up to his role."	3.0	"The ""Phantom"" almost destory this film, like the Paris Opera house"	2005-08-22	15	4	11
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ALGLO3SSG6HK1	"G. L. Masters ""sywren"""	I went to see this movie with high expectations, and I must say that I was not disappointed in the least.  Yes, there are a few differences from the stage production which I have seen twice in Atlanta, Ga.  I have loved this musical since I was a teenager when I only had the soundtrack to listen to.Gerard Butler was wonderful as the Phantom.  I felt his desire for companionship and love with every heartbreaking note of his songs.  It was nice to have a young Phantom whom you could actually see Christine falling in love with.Emmy Rossum was equally as wonderful as Christine.  You could  see her desire for the Phantom when he was singing to her.The entire cast was fabulous.  But like anything that makes it way from stage to screen, or book to screen things change.  As for the director.  I thought that he did a wonderful job getting it to the screen.  My breath was taken from me when the chandelier was raised and the damage and spiderwebs were slowly blown away to show the beautiful Opera house.  I cannot say enough good things about this film.  I have seen it twice already, and will be going back for more.If you go expecting the exact stage production then you may be let down, but if you go with an open mind you will have a blast.	5.0	Phantom was wonderful in so many ways....	2005-01-04	4	4	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ANHJ3DAMMTAF8	Gordon E. Holaday, Jr.	"First off, I want to rant about the reviews I have read so far.  Every review I have read comments on how Gerard Butler, as the Phantom, sings ""horribly"" or ""like a Meat Loaf stuffed with too much garlic"" as quoted by Entertainment Weekly Jan 28th Edition. If this is the only thing people are getting from his portrayal of the Phantom, then we are missing the true essence of the Phantom.Who is Phantom?  A deragned elusive murdering maniac who is so very deluded by what has happened to him in his lifetime that he makes choices whether wrong or right to get what he wants.I thought his performance was incredible. You get a much better feel as to Phantom's true emotions.  He isn't just singing, he is exposing all of what Phantom has to offer.  The question I have to ask all of the reviewers who gave him a bad review for his singing capabilities is ""what makes this love story so good?""The answer is simple.  Phantom and his madness.The movie was also fabulous.  Extremely inventive with the Masquerade sequence. For those reading this that havent seen the Broadway musical or dont know much about the plot, it is as follows:The movie opens at an auction at the Paris Opera House. A participant makes rememberant of a time when the opera house was alive and booming. A chandelier, Lot #666, an infamous relic from a horrifying story of an opera ghost.  With the lighting of this mystifing antique, we are taken back to the living days of the House.In the prime of the Opera House there is a ghost who haunts the lives of the actors and owners of the Opera House.  He creates a relationship with a chorus girl names Christine Daae.  His love and passion for he develops into a hate when she falls in love with a sweetheart from her childhood.The story takes some very interesting twists as opposed to the Broadway version.  (Even for the ""long-time"" Phantom enthusiasts)For those who were not impressed, please take a second to think more about this version on an emotional level, and understand that this Phantom is more real, and true to his madness, which you see, and clearly ""hear""."	5.0	A darker side for the Phantom!	2005-02-13	10	8	2

I had my doubts before seeing this movie. I had never seen the play and the music hadn't appealed to me very much. After watching it, though, I was so awestruck by its design that the songs didn't sound so bad after all. Of course, Joel Schumacher having once been a costume designer and art director, knew what  he was doing. Sure, there may have been criticism that the Phantom wasn't portrayed correctly, but hey, there's nothing wrong with updating a classic. I got the special edition thinking I would learn more about the process of the film, but it was mostly interviews with people not even in the movie.Revered critics Ebert and Roeper both gave ""The Phantom"" thumbs down because they claimed that the Phantom looked more like a GQ model with the mask as his fashion accessory. Also, that the actor who played the Phantom did not sing well. They also may have a biased view because they said they didn't like the play to begin with. Still, they did mention that the sets were among the best they had ever seen in a movie, which was good.Anyways, it doesn't really matter what critics thought of it. The movie was great, and is now sided with my other favorite, Moulin Rouge."	5.0	COMPARED TO MOULIN ROUGE IN DESIGN	2005-05-19	4	1	3
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2OCSKCA8JG2Q1	Grace G.	"The first time around I got a splitting headache from all that singing (the only musical I'd ever bothered to watch up until then was Grease).  The second time I frowned whenever I listened to Butler hit a high note (kind of like when Carlotta's belting out that song and everybody cringes, yeah like that.) I cringed when he growled, when he screams ""deep as HELL!"" oi, I cringed.  The 3rd time I saw it alone without any distractions; I even put on a pair of headphones. I Began to develop a soft spot for the story.  By the time I had to return it I didn't want to.  It grew on me.  The music just stays right in there, until you find yourself humming absentmindedly to it.  Visually, it is exquisite.  The costumes, the set designs (one would think the Phantom and ""The Haunting's"" Hugh Crane might have been compadres or something because the O.G.'s lair displays alot of gothic, mid-century decor that resembles that of Hill Houses's).As for the casting, Minnie Driver's Carlotta acts more like a spoiled little brat than a Diva.  She's great! I'm not complaining, but I'm dissapointed that they had to dub her voice.  Emmy Rossum's Christine is rather young, and naive.Her voice is lovely! she's a lovely Christine but her acting seems to be off-key at times.  Patrick Wilson's Raoul is romantic.  His voice is charming, but the acting as well seems to be off-key very often.  I'd expect these characters to be passionately portrayed, it's not just about the voice. Finally, Gerard Butler's phantom may have dissapointed me with the singing (sometimes), but his acting is superb. He's dark, passionate and seductive. But he's also demented.  Great performance.  The voice isn't quite on par with Michael Crawford's but it works like a charm with most of the women that make up 95% of the audience so...no comment about the looks.  Let's face it, no matter how much his voice strains, he's still great eyecandy, and the women love him.I was a skeptic (still am), but this film grew on me because of the intense story plot, the music, and Gerard Butler.One of those 3 usually become major attracting elements with first time viewers.  I recommend it, but you're free to like or dislike it.  I learned to appreciate it despite it's many flaws."	5.0	Lovely Goth/Romance	2005-07-26	3	3	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A328S9RN3U5M68	Grady Harp	PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is certainly one of the most lavishly beautiful two and a half hours of film to come along in a while.  The constructed sets of the French Opera House Populaire from the exterior, the backstage, the auditorium (with of course the infamous chandelier!), and the subterranean grotto which serves as the home of the phantom are sumptuous for the eye:  they were all built with meticulous care inside the studios in England from Anthony Pratt's designs.  So, too, is the cemetery where much of the action takes place - all mists, tombs, statuary, snow, mysterious lighting, again with kudos to Anthony Pratt. The costumes designed by Alexandra Byrne are elegant and time appropriate and the large cast wears them with aplomb.  And if the film stopped here (and for many it does) this would be a sensational movie.The problem with this extravagantly gorgeous decor is that it is left with little substance to bear up under the surface majesty.  First, the ever popular Andrew Lloyd Webber musical is a bit of fluff meant for the stage, a work with superficial characters all of whom must bow to the real star of the piece - the Chandelier and its descent.  There are a few songs that are lovely, but those few notes are stretched over repetitions that try in vain to be transformed into fresh works.  The story itself is handed down from an old book by Gaston Leroux that has, like Dracula and Frankenstein,  for some reason continued to fascinate audiences in many incarnations. As a work for the stage PHANTOM has been satisfying audiences for years.  Joel Schumacher and Webber have now given us a cinematic treatment that for all its visual splendor is an empty, pompous, threadbare tale.The cast is certainly adequate, given the material.  Emmy Rossum as Christine is lovely to watch, has enormous screen presence, and a serviceable though thin soprano voice.  Likewise for the Raoul of Patrick Wilson and the Phantom of Gerard Butler.  One wonders why Schumacher insisted on actors who could sing their roles and then present them on screen with some of the weakest lip-synching on celluloid: they deserve better.  The one exception to Schumacher's rule is the Carlotta of Minnie Driver who does not sing her own role but DOES lip synch better than the rest.  Miranda Richardson as Madame Ciry is the most solid and credible actor in the cast, a group that includes the talents of Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds, Jennifer Ellison, among others.The cinematography by John Mathieson is splendid and despite the comments above the direction by Joel Schumacher does move this hollow vehicle around in a way that makes the story more convincing than did the stage version. His use of black and white imagery in the flashback scenes is splendid and suggests old etchings becoming animated. But in the end (and the end is a long time in coming) this PHANTOM lacks the substance that the Faberge trappings suggest.  Go for the decor and costumes alone and you'll not be disappointed.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	APASOUCF2UD42	Greg Curtis	"The long-awaited film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's smash stage hit, The Phantom of the Opera, is everything fans will expect and more.The story takes place in 1870, as the company of the Paris Opera House is plagued by mysterious happenings said to be caused by a ghost. Rising star Christine Daae is caught in a love triangle, torn between her romantic childhood crush, the dashing Raoul de Chagny, and her tutor of many years, the reclusive ""Angel of Music"". But the latter turns out to be the Phantom, whose desperate need to be loved descends into insanity as he first stalks, then kidnaps, his muse.The screenplay has been modified to include additional dialogue, expanded roles for both Raoul and Madame Giry (it's clear she knows more than she is letting on), and the infamous collapse of the chandelier occurs much later in the story. Further, flashbacks (including scenes when the principal characters were children) explain some of the questions that only readers of Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel knew the answers to.Any cinematic treatment of a live show should try to outdo its progenitor, and director Joel Schumacher has successfully met the challenge. Every frame is filled with movement and colour which, thankfully, do not suffer from the pervading darkness of Evita. Dream-like sequences accentuate the melancholy mood, and the highly-detailed costumes and sets are exquisite.The cast of largely unfamiliar faces is headed by Emmy Rossum as Christine. She gives the role a luminous vitality, and has a wonderful octave range; every moment she appears on screen is enchanting. Patrick Wilson is quite impressive as Raoul and is poised for leading-man status. But the true star is Minnie Driver, whose interpretation of the self-centred Diva, Carlotta, is worthy of an Oscar.Sadly, the lavish production is wasted on the effort of Gerard Butler who, in the title role, is the film's only disappointment. Although his passion for and understanding of the Phantom's sorrow is evident, he seems to have been cast more for his sex appeal than musical talent. His singing lacks power and is better suited to hard rock than opera; dressed in black and white and with an open shirt, he resembles a member of 70's band KISS. As a result, the Phantom is merely the boy from the wrong side of the tracks, as opposed to a tortured composer and svengali. (And when his disfigurement is finally revealed, it is -- oddly -- barely gruesome, looking like nothing more than eczema.)The biggest mystery in The Phantom of the Opera, then, is not on screen, but why Lloyd Webber is so fond of Butler. Still, it is the best adaptation of a musical in decades. The uninitiated who never saw the original show may find the film somewhat trite, but the tragic tale will put a tear in your eye.

Perkins ""wide reader"""	"SPOILERS FOLLOWThis 2004 film of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is extremely solid.  With a good cast including Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, and Minnie Driver it is very well-done.The one major criticism I have is that Mr. Butler's operatic voice is barely serviceable, and hardly up to the Michael Crawford standard.  This is especially noticeable in the classic title song.  Emmy Rossum fares much better as Christine, the Phantom's obsession.  Delays cost the musical's original cast from doing this movie and are no doubt partially responsible for the movie's being a pale, though still game companion to Broadway stagings even without the original cast.  Ms. Rossum's soprano is true and vibrant.  Minnie Driver is a scene stealer as Carlotta, the Paris Opera House diva.This is still a very nice film representation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical."	4.0	Extremely good film of the Webber musical, but Gerard Butler pales in comparison to Michael Crawford	2011-02-27	1	0	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1EYUZTL1RY5CV	"Guy Brown ""Guy"""	This movie is loaded with stunning performances, but none bigger then Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, and Patrick Wilson. However, this movie had to deal with a lot of doubting critics like most plays turned into movies. Because in the past 35 years, there have only been 3 successful box-office musicals, and that was Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita and Chicago. I think Phantom Of The Opera is really good, remains loyal and with the help of stunning direction by Joel Schumacher it is made a classic movie. I think it surpasses Evita. And it also marks Andrew Lloyd Webber's 3rd musical adaption which also includes Evita and of course the classic Jesus Christ Superstar. I think Phantom Of The Opera can join them both as a movie classic, anyone who likes the play will love this movie. I was impressed by Emmy Rossom's performance, 16 years old during filming and she steals the show with her magnificent voice. Gerard Butler plays a wonderful Phantom and does well on bringing that character to life. Patrick Wilson can't be left out, his wonderful voice also makes his character worth watching in the film. Again, if you like the play, you will love this movie. Buying the dvd is worth every penny, believe me.	4.0	An Amazing Performance	2005-06-07	2	0	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1U6R9WN7DJZFX	haan	One of the best things about this movie is the opportunities the director had for costumes, sets, and special effects and the extent to which he used them.The opening scene with the effects of the chandelier and all the dust coming off the seats and boxes draws you right into the story and the transition during THINK OF ME is seamless and the going through the mirror is extremely well done, too.With the costuming, it seemed to me that when Christine ripped off the Phantom's mask, his face was disfigured in more areas than the mask covered.And I thought that Christine showed a little too much cleavage.Gerald Butler and Patrick Swift do excellent jobs with their characters, Patrick Swift's impression of Raoul was very close to that in the book.I was unable to see the director's thinking with Minnie Driver's performance as Carlotta; she switches between a strong French accent and a strong Italian accent and the result isn't laughable, but almost completely un-understandable.I felt that the worst performance came from Emily Rossum, as Christine. I understand that during most of the show, Christine is in a trance, but Emily Rossum's acting skills are, well, non-existent. She manages to spend the show looking bland and indifferent, from the parts where she's SUPPOSED to grive for her father, be terrified about the fate of her fianc? at the hands of the Phantom, to joy.I do like this movie a lot, but Schamucher could have made some better decisions.Also, I don't reccomend this film for anyone under the age of 12 or 13 due to some fairly graphic images that appear only briefly throughout the movie.	5.0	Schamucher Makes the Most of His Movie	2006-04-19	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2GPN2VKS8E77C	HAMLET	"This big screen version of the novel by Gaston Leroux and the stage musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber is excellent. It inspired the classic 1925 silent version starring Lon Chaney (aka ""The Man Of A Thousand Faces"") as The Phantom. Andrew Lloyd Webber also produced and wrote the screenplay for the film (aside from writing a new song for the film, which is also the only original song, ""Learn To Be Lonely,"" sung at over the end credits of the movie by Minnie Driver, whose vocals in the movie were dubbed by an actual opera diva, so I believe this was Mr. Webber's way of making it up to her). This movie also stars Gerard Butler (the made-for-TV movie ""Attila"", ""Tomb Raider 2: The Cradle Of Life"") in the title role of The Phantom, a horribly disfigured, murderous recluse who haunts the Paris Opera House and is enchanted by Christine, a beautiful, young singer; demanding in and of itself, no easy task. The brilliant Emmy Rossum (Sean Penn's ill-fated daughter in ""Mystic River"" and Jake Gyllenhaal's love interest in ""The Day After Tomorrow"") also stars as Christine Daae, the object of the Phantom's affections. Patrick Wilson (""Angels In America"") plays Vicomte Raoul De Chagny, Christine's child-hood friend and the Phantom's rival for Christine. Miranda Richardson (the villainous Queen Mab in ""Merlin"") co-stars as Madame Giry, the only one who knows the score between the Phantom and Christine. Minnie Driver (Robbie Coltrane's girlfriend in ""Goldeneye"", the voice of Jane in Disney's ""Tarzan"", etc.) has a minor role as Carlotta, the stuck-up diva caught in the cross-fire. The lovely Jennifer Ellison provides excellent support as Meg, Madame Giry's daughter and Christine's confidante. All the actors in the film were magnificent, especially the excellent Mr. Butler, who really carries the film, conveying everything from menace to tenderness and the scintilatingly pretty Ms. Rossum, who sings very well; she joined the Metropolitan Opera at the age of 7. Joel Shumacher (""Batman And Robin"", ""Veronica Guerin"") does a wonderful job directing this film, as he was Mr. Webber's first and only choice to direct this film. All of the songs are so good, it would be hard to pick the best one, but the most familiar one is ""Music Of The Night,"" sung by The Phantom. This film is definitely worth multiple viewings at the multi-plex and is assured classic musical film status. I nearly cried during this movie and I left the theater (Muvico 18 at I-95 & Stirling Road) humming some of the tunes, especially the tender love song ""All I Ask Of You."" The soundtrack (see my review on it) is everything I expected...and more. As good as the film itself. The film left some minor plot points unclear, however. Not that it's a bad thing, but ""Is a wee bit of closure too much to ask?"" Maybe Andrew Lloyd Webber did that so that we either read the novel by Gaston Leroux, see the musical or draw our own conclusions as to the missing information in the movie. It's one of the greatest movies that I've ever seen. Love it.If Mel Gibson's controversial, but successful epic drama, ""The Passion Of The Christ"" doesn't get nominated for any Academy Awards (as I think will be the case), ""The Phantom Of The Opera"" should be nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Original Song or (at least) Best Costume Design. I nearly cried when I saw this film. The ""Brief Violent Images"" weren't intense enough to warrant a PG-13 rating. The film should've been rated PG for momentary nudity (for those considering bringing children to this movie, or for those who are too prudish and can't handle it; it's not a woman baring her breasts, anyway, then I would understand the PG-13 or R rating) and brief frightening images. I recommend that you read the novel first (which I haven't read), see the 1925 silent film version and see the stage musical (which I haven't seen) before seeing this movie, which is faithful to the book and stage play. The author and Andrew Lloyd Webber wouldn't have been credited if the movie hadn't been faithful to the original novel by Leroux and the stage musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber. I recommend this film entirely to anyone who likes musicals (""The Sound Of Music"", ""My Fair Lady"", ""West Side Story"", ""The King And I"", ""Chicago"", etc). Should be right up there with these timeless films. So, if you like music, comedy (which is outbalanced here; not that it's a bad thing, it was necessary) and drama (or just one of the three) and you want to see them all rolled into one, then this is the movie for you.The DVD is LOADED with ""Phantom"" extras: the original theatrical trailer (on Disc 1) and on Disc 2, an hour-long ""Behind The Mask: The History Of The Phantom Of The Opera,"" (with Andrew Lloyd Webber, Hal Prince and others) which is an absolute MUST for theater and movie fans, a 45-minute featurette on the making of the film (with director Joel Schumacher, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Emmy Rossum, Gerard Butler, Patrick Wilson and other members of the cast and crew) and a deleted scene: ""No One Would Listen,"" which is great, but, as there's no commentary as to why the scene was cut and it leaves the curiosity that you have over the reason that the scene was cut open; look it up in the editorial reviews for this film, but it's showing up on DVD is absolutely fine.Rated PG for brief frightening images."	5.0	"One Of The Greatest Musicals Of All Time!!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2HQ9VTZXKQ3BF	"hannibalsmith ""hannibalsmith"""	This is a gorgeously shot film that stays more or less faithful to Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage production.  The changes to the plot are minor (a few key events happen at different points in the movie, but it doesn't harm things), as far as I could tell... my main recollection of the stage production is from the double CD original cast recording.  In most regards the film is terrific - the visuals are stunning, the screen play is dead on and the production is fabulous.In my estimation, where the film falters a bit is on the casting of the main roles.The one exception to this is Emmy Rossum, who is just about perfectly cast as Christine.  Her vocal performance is every bit as good as Sarah Brightman's and she simply looks ravishing.  No wonder that both the Phantom and Raul are swooning over her.But in my opinion, Gerard Butler is miscast as the Phantom.  For me, personally, I didn't need to see Michael Crawford reprise his role.  On the other hand, I think that a better performer could have been found to play the Phantom.  While Butler's acting is fine, I was never under the impression that the Phantom was supposed to be a gorgeous hunk in all respects save for a small blemish on one side of his face.  Unfortunately, that's what Butler's Phantom is.  In addition, vocally Butler barely holds his own.  One gets the impression that the role is just a stretch for his level of talent and training.  Although he did sort of grow on me as the film went on, he seemed completely overmatched in the Phantom's first vocal number of the film (the self-titled duet with Christine).  From there he did get better but I never felt that vocally he was really up to the level that the role deserved.The actor who plays Raul gives an unmemorable performance.  There's nothing wrong with it, but again, I feel that a better performer could have been found for this role.Most of the supporting players are fine - Madame Giri, Meg, and Carlotta are all good - Carlotta especially - Mini Driver straddles the line between giving a good performance and an over-the-top performance with skill.In any case, I highly recommend this movie.  Those who are familiar with Phantom will not be disappointed and those who aren't will be pleasantly surprised.	4.0	Almost perfect...	2009-02-09	1	0	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1Q0QPN7BPRRI	Hansel	The casting is bad. Gerard Butler as the Phantom is much too charming and way too charming over Raoul, the young and handsome aristocrat whom Christine has fallen in love with. It makes the audience wonder why Christine has chosen Raoul over the Phantom.Raoul's weak voice does not do justice to the songs and thank heavens he sings little. Christine (Emmy Rossum), on the other hand, sings like an angel and is quite marvelous.The storyline is sometimes confusing and disjointed and unrealistic; some parts were unnecessary and unnecessarily long, causing the audience's attention to stray at times during the 2 and half hour movie.	3.0	On the whole, disappointing	2005-06-12	10	4	6

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AG0QMUY1ZLKJG	Happy Helper : )	Another movie of superb quality and fine music:Phantom of the Opera with Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum.They both outdo themselves, so outstanding are their performances.The underlying story is an extremely powerful metaphor of unrequited, yet undying true love.The phantom is everywoman's fantasy dream... fantasy mind you. Powerful, dark, wounded, handsome, mysterious, teacher, suitor, hidden admirer, obsessor, abductor, finally, savior and releaser.It's one of the finest subliminal stories ever written to illustrate so many hidden allegorical human psychology in one fell swoop.It's a Dickens tale melded with Shakespearean tragedy and embellished with some of the finest music ever written.The acting, singing, performances, stellar. If you allow yourself to be taken away, you will be transported.The artistry of this movie is actually phantasmagorical and of the highest caliber.No wonder this opera has the longest run in history, and will continue to do so... at least in my humble estimation.It is difficult to imagine how one could top the primal power of this story, coupled with the soaring, moving music...	5.0	One of the Finest Movies of All Time - Phantom of the Opera	2009-07-26	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AZ8H7JCN1ZHZA	Harpingonforever	Oh, jeez. I didn't think that I would like this, but I sat down and recorded it anyway, because if a movie isn't good, it's still fun to make fun of it. So I sat down on the couch and settled in with a roll of the eyes and then-- BAM! I was caught in this onslaught of music and insanity and the best costumes I've ever seen. There are no words for how wonderful this movie is... I admit I am now completely obsessed with it! I also have to admit I admire sopranos: I'm an alto, so in some of those parts I was like, YIKES! Emmy was amazing as Christine. What's this I hear about her being 17? Wow. And Gerard Butler... I know some people are gonna say, oh, he wasn't as good as what's-his name, but I don't agree. Both Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler were, in my opinion, better suited to the roles. And Minnie Driver was really good at the acting of Carlotta, even though she was dubbed by a soprano. But what I'm wondering is, why is there a horse in the sewers? That's a little odd, don't you think? Anyway, it made me get all teary-eyed, which movies don't ever do, so I'm happy. **sighs** I've watched this a lot this weekend and haven't gotten tired of it.I completely understood the character of the Phantom, why he did the things he did. That little bit of backstory did a world of good. Raoul (Patrick Wilson) was a little bland, but that wasn't his acting, he just didn't have the psychology he needed to flesh out the character. Christine was a little nave for my taste, but again, that was the character, not the acting. I love the ending, it's so great that the Phantom has never lost his love for Christine. It's kind of an Awwww moment.Anyway, thanks for reading my review!~Harpingonforever	5.0	I Wish There Were More Stars to Give!	2012-09-02	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A28ILXH590CMRJ	Hazen B Markoe	"Many people will look at this film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's classic musical spectacular, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA with mixed emotions.  There are people who will be upset that Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, who played the original Christine and Phantom respectively, were not allowed to recreate their signature roles. There will also be people who'll be disappointed that this version is not a literal translation of the stage musical.  Finally, we have the critics of both Webber and director Joel Schumacher, who have both been accused of wretched excess in previous projects in their individual careers.  Taken as a film version however, this PHANTOM stands the test of time, not only as a wonderful musical film, but as one of the more faithful versions of Gaston Laroux's romance/horror novel.Starting with a black and white prologue, the film tells the story of budding opera star Christine Daae and the two men who fight for her heart: the noble Viscount who she knew in childhood, and the mysterious Phantom of the Paris Opera House who hides his ugliness behind a half-mask while sponsoring Christine's career.  Like the stage production, this film is awash in glorious colors and sets that would put many epics to shame. It's well balanced by solid performances that help propel the romantic, if melodramatic, story along.Gerard Butler makes for a wonderfully dark and obsessive Phantom, while allowing the character to retain the audience's sympathy. Miranda Richardson is solid as the dour Madame Giry, who knows the Phantom's secret.  Minnie Driver easily gets the most laughs as the over-bearing diva, Carlotta.  (It's interesting to note that Ms. Driver's singing is dubbed in the film proper, while she actually sings the new closing credits melody ""Learn to be Lonely."") Patrick Wilson makes for a stalwart, if somewhat bland, Viscount.  But the strongest impression is made by the lovely Emmy Rossum.  Only in her late teens when filming, she turns in a fantastic performance with a crystal clear voice that does justice to Webber's score. Joel Schumacher does a strong enough job in directing this film, allowing the music and the screenplay that he co-wrote with Webber to shine.In the end, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a delightful spectacle that does justice in its own way to both the stage original and Laroux's book.  As such, this is a film I highly recommend."	5.0	PHANTOM is a solid and spectacular film musical	2004-12-25	925	867	58

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3EFPZJJ8WZX2Y	Heather	"I LOVED this film, and I am counting down the days until it is available in Australia!One thing that I would like to mention that in the review by S. E Kautzman ""wizardoz30"", it is stated that the make up effects are not consistent-that the phantom originally has a normal hairline and when his mask is taken off he has hardly any hair. This is not a continuity mistake. I thought it was when I first saw it, but after seeing it 7 times, I noticed what actually happens. In the scene before 'Don Juan' where the Phantom is singing: ""I hate to cut the fun short, but the joke's wearing thin, let my opera begin"", if you look in the bottom left corner of the screen you will see a wig on a dummy head (he is also fiddling with his hair as you would with a wig). And in 'Don Juan' when Christine takes of the mask, you can actually see the wig falling off.But I totally agree with what the other positive reviews all have to say... it is a fantastic film, and I think more powerful than the original version."	5.0	Fantastic	2005-03-13	2	2	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1283Z83HCLL36	Heather Simmons	The Phantom of the Opera is the best movie I have seen in years. Having read Gaston Leroux's version, and not seeing the stage version, I was expecting a horror story. When I realized it was actually a romance I was hesitant to watch it because I am not a fan of romance movies, but as soon as the overture began playing I was complelely sucked in. The music was unlike anything I had ever heard before and I fell in love with it. I also did not recognize any of the actors except for Miranda Richarson and Minnie Driver. I also knew who Gerard Butler was from Tomb Raider but did not recognize him at all. I thought the three main actors (Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, and Patrick Wilson) were singers they picked off Broadway or the Opera. Their performances were breathtaking. This is the only movie that I can watch a hundred times and cry everytime. Gerard Butler breaks my heart as the Phantom. Emmy Rossum was amazing and incredibly beautiful as Christine. Patrick Wilson was a perfect Raoul. I was a little disapointed that he did not have as much screen time as I was expecting, because in Leroux's version the story follows Raoul through the story. In Andrew Lloyd Webber's version the story seems to follow Christine. I think Raoul could have been included in a little more of the story, but I still give the movie the highest rating I can give. Altogether, even though the movie is quite a bit different from the book, it will still remain one of my favorite movies of all time. This movie is one of those films that sucks you right into the story, and you start to feel for the characters, especially the Phantom, as though they were real people. You will fall in love right alongside Christine and Raoul and your heart will break right along with the Phantom's. It is an experience you will never forget and one you will want to have again. I recommend it to everyone.	5.0	Incredible, Beautiful, and Heartbreaking	2006-03-16	3	2	1

It is quite apparent however that its virtues are theatrical and not cinematic and the style is borrowed from the excellent Moulin Rouge 2001.However, The Phantom of the Opera contains wonderful ORIGINAL music and libretto, as Moulin Rouge didn`t.What remains a letdown is that the Lloyd Webber`s phantom is not diabolique enough. It all ends rather corny, over the top and overlong. Examples are the abduction of Christine by a HORSE in the Paris sewers and Raoul belting out his despair, tied by the Phantom in the finale.There are compensations however in the sets, music and performances, but Lloyd Webber should have given the screen adaptation a moore bloody treament on the gore side hehehe.Why I am attacking Mr Webber? Well, it is QUITE apparant that the director`s hand has been tied here and that the 2004 movie production is Mr Lloyd Webber`s vision of his brainchild on the screen.Sad to say, I much more prefer the Claude Rains/Susanna Foster/Nelson Eddy version, made by Universal in 1943.

I have seen the theatre production six times: three in Sydney and three in Melbourne. Alas, not in London as yet.The film has some very strong points, in particular the sets and spectacular camera angles (perhaps just computer imagery). But right from the start I was disappointed that it copied the introduction of Moulin Rouge.The acting and singing was an enormous let down. Christine was the best of an average bunch. The Phantom was terrible... OMG! His singing was atrocious. Apart from that, he was far too young. Raoul was average. The prima donna was way too over the top. She lacked the substance needed of the role and appeared way over accented and dramatic.I wasn't a happy chappy but midway through the movie....  the cinema blacked out!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1GRPBJ38IVX54	"H. R. Trigg ""howietUK"""	NOTE; I HAVE SEEN THE FILM, MANY REVIEWERS BELOW HAVEN'T???Now, I should start this review by stating that I have NOT seen the stage version, however I am a fan of the original stage soundtrack (Sarah Brightman & Michael Crawford). I am reviewing the film based purely on what I saw and heard, without comparisokn.It would also appear this is a love or hate film, as many of the reviewers here loved the film. Anyway...My first criticism is that whilst the film looked lavish, it actually looked more like a stage set than 'real life', some of the backdrops looked like exactly that,(especially the outdoor scenes) and I found it off putting at times. I also found that the black & white scenes looked cheap, almost tv movie quality. (Present is filmed in B&W;, past in colour).As for the performances, well Emmy Rossum was passable as Christine, though her vocals are a far cry from Ms Brightmans. Gerard Butler as the Phantom, is a disappointment.  His singing is below par, and almost has a speech impediment(?) and seems to have no control over volume.  Throughout the film, he is quite an attractive Phantom, but when he is unveiled, he becomes hideous, even his hair changing colour and texture, and scars appear where the mask didn't even cover.  Ridiculous, viewers are far more discerning these days, we expect more care and attention to detail.Patrick Wilson as Raoul is fine, and Miranda Richardson is underused as Madame Giry (Christines 'mother') - it should be noted she is the only one to attempt a French accent! Hello, the film is set in Paris with just 1 French person!  So Hollywood it's ridiculous.  Are Americans scared of a foreign accent?The best performances for me came from Minnie Driver, who is a fine over the top Diva, and Simon Callow as one of the Opera's new managers.In summary, this film is a huge disappointment, with poor vocal performances rendering the music lacklustre and emotionless.  Definately poorly cast, and whilst I am not suggesting the originals return, the vocals should have been the most important reason to cast, not JUST a pretty face...If you want to watch a Webber musical, then get Evita on Dvd, its a far more superior film in every way, vocally, visually, lyrically, emotionally.  That is how this film SHOULD have been.This is just disappointing... :((and I meant to score this film with 2stars not 3, but I cant edit that?)	3.0	Tacky and disappointing	2004-12-17	61	13	48
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A138MO1MIXPHD5	H. Tambini	After hearing several reviews of the film I was relucant to watch. I love the original soundtrack and finally was able to see in Manhattan (although I don't remember it now). I was afraid the movie would ruin my love for the play.  Not a chance.  I ordered it On Demand and figured I had nothing to lose for $4.  I was not disappointed.  I was on the edge of my seat at the end (it's been awhile since I listened to it and couldn't remember what happened).  To see it in the film version, much of the recording made sense.  It explained parts I couldn't fully comprehend from just listening. Have to check the credits to see if anyone did their own singing because at times it looked dubbed, but tolerable.  The Phantom was rather sexy and not grotesque.  The script did stick to original recording.  I believe one review said the songs were different but it was almost verbatum.  Few lines were sort of spoken rather than fully sung but it perfect.  Well done.  Now I will buy the special edition.  Better than Les Mis (I still haven't been able to sit through that entire Liam Neison version).	5.0	Won't disappoint Phantom fans	2005-07-09	0	0	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2LUJ7HIK09GEU	H. Thomas	Yes it is visual stunning and Emmy Rossum is fantastic. The music is partially well, but its based too much on sound effects. There are the title melody and Christines song that are typical for Webber's genius, but the rest is kitsch, simply he overdid it with beeing commercial. I dont know if this is absolutely true to the original Webber musical, but I have seen an other Phantom Of The Opera movie where the storyline is much better drawn out.Here in this movie of Schumacher, the story does not unfold, right in the beginning Christine already is becoming the star, and they say she had lessions from someone unknown - but it is right after her coming out as a great singer that she meets the phantom the first time. This makes no sense! In the other movie she first met with him during a long time period and learns with him, until he finally arranges that she can replace the operas diva. In Schumachers film there are several ridiculous moments, but the big one is at the end when Phantom binds Raoul to the gate, it is so laughable, it hurts. And the opera explodes as if its a dynamit depot. The movie reveals that Phantom really came as a little boy into the opera, escaping from a circus where he was shown and mistreated for his ugly face. This means he has really no right to be in the opera and he also has absolutely no artistic background, so how did he learn singing or to teach it? - by the way he can not really sing, if his singing voice is that from Gerard Butler, Butler really is no singer. I was disappointed to learn that Phantom has really no background to be at the opera. In the other movie it was left in the dark, but it seemed that he is there because of a long family relation with the opera or even was from an owners or directors family, in any case he came with a music background.	1.0	Bad storyline	2007-08-06	13	3	10

I dreamed of seeing it again but tickets are quite expensive. I was thrilled when this movie came out and was impressed at how accurate and moving it was. The movie includes a lot of dramatic scenes that take me back to the stage performance. My kids recently watched this with me and loved it so I had to buy it. Now we can watch it over and over and sing along with our favorite songs. I was blown away when I found out Gerard Butler was the phantom.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ADEJYIFDD1QGL	I am so smart...S-M-R-T	Long time ago, I read Phantom of the Opera and thought a long time about what a beautiful story it was. Sad, but beautiful. And then, last December, I heard that in the orchastra I play in we were gonna play Music of the Night. After listening to the track on the soundtrack, I thought...I have to see this movie. And so I did.I am impressed by the plot, the costumes, and acting, and most importantly, the singing. I loved all the characters (even the annoying Spanish lady who reminds me of my arch nemesis...) and I almost cried at the end when the Phantom is left broken hearted.It spirals down to this: This is a beautiful musical for those who don't mind when the characters just spontaniously burst into song and don't mind costumes, or catchy tunes. This is an amazing movie and I look forward to (when I scrap up the money) buying it. I highly recommend it to anyone.	5.0	Hoorah! A musical that makes musicals look good!	2005-06-04	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A13Z4WH02WELDS	ilovecalifornia	"I've LOVED the musical Phantom of the Opera and everything Andrew Lloyd Webber for almost 20 years (I hate my husband for having seen the musical with the ORIGINAL cast no less and didn't appreciate it as he was only 10!). I watched the musical in 1994 in London(a nice experience). I'm still listening to the same old CD and falling in love with Michael Crawford each time. My babies' lullabies are from this musical. I'm disappointed in the 2004 movie as a passionate fan of the Phantom (both novel and musical). I didn't watch it when when it first came out (I remember the bad reviews and my disappointment at the main cast), bought the DVD in 2005 out of curiosity (wasn't wooed then). I tried to show it today to my little girl to tempt her into going to Broadway with me but I just cringed when we fast forwarded to ""think of me"" and ""phantom of the opera"". The performances lack in emotions. Emmy Rossum looks so plastic, she just bugs me throughout (my personal opinion: doesn't deliver as a lead performer or actress despite being a good singer). I didn't care much for Gerard Butler or his voice. Lately, I couldn't help thinking, Amanda Seyfried should have been the Christine in the movie (I only know her from Mamma Mia). Maybe that movie was made too late (no Sarah Brightman or Michael Crawford), maybe it should have been made by Coppola (because of ""Dracula"") or any more inspired director, maybe this movie just didn't meet my vision and memories of the original musical or Phantom full stop. The magic or passion just weren't there for me. Nice supporting cast and cinematography though.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1SCJWCMQ3W3KK	Irishgal	"In the world of musicals, there have been many standouts; ""South Pacific"", ""Oklahoma"", ""My Fair Lady"", and ""The Sound of Music"" are just a few of the wonders that have delighted audiences the world over. But in recent times, no one has captured the imagination of fans everywhere like Andrew Lloyd Webber and his masterpiece, ""The Phantom of the Opera"". Eighteen years after opening on the West End and sixteen years after beginning on Broadway, ""Phantom"" has finally taken the world by storm as a movie. And it's still unbeatable.Of the many critics of the film, the main complaint has been with casting - mainly, that of the lead role. While Michael Crawford shone in the theater production, the choice of Gerard Butler as the movie phantom had many heads being scratched. Butler doesn't have as commanding of a voice as Crawford, yet it still works. His gravelly tone and dangerous appeal play a nice complement to the smooth tones of Patrick Wilson as Raoul, and it is this danger that lures Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum) to his dark world.When some musicals make the transition to film, they remain as they were on stage, resulting in a somewhat stilted performance. The fact that ""Phantom"" doesn't follow its stage counterpart exactly is a welcome relief. The movie mainly acts as a flashback, with short interruptions to show the present-day, shot as if they were film reels of the early 20th century. This nicely breaks up parts that would not have fared so well on the screen.Overall, ""Phantom"" is a delight to watch on the screen. Butler and Wilson are brilliantly matched as foes, and Emmy Rossum shines as Christine Daae - I actually prefer her performance to that of Sarah Brightman. Lush and overstated, it captures the passion of the story in a way that will leave you breathless."	5.0	Unbeatable	2009-05-23	3	3	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1PBUBIFKPQ9I8	Jael Jones	Unsurprisingly, the pompous cacophony that was the film of the beautiful stage play, 'the Phantom of the Opera' was an outright failure at the box office internationally. There are several possible reasons for this : the utter lack of singing ability exhibited by its 2 leads (supposed to be musical geniuses!), the art direction which removed the Gothic from the story and replaced it with pure Disney, totally inexplicable directorial choices such as the inclusion of a horse in the underground scene during the title song (there may have been a horse in the book, but did it appear out of a sea of dry ice? Please!).The play is powerful and emotive; the film is cheesier than a French fromagerie on International Cheese Day awaiting the arrival of the World Cheese Judging Panel for an all-night cheese-a-thon.Hopefully, someday some-one will make a more thoughtful, imagainative, musically adept version of the play.

Whether you're a phan or not, I'd bet money that you'll love this film version of the perfect musical.If you're skeptical because the Phantom isn't played by the wonderful Michael Crawford, sorry to be so harsh, but GET OVER IT!  You can't call yourself a phan if you're letting that casting decision keep you from watching the movie.Gerry Butler does a phantastic job of playing the Phantom.  He may not have a perfect voice, as Michael Crawford does, but it's easy to fall in love with his performance.Emmy Rossum fills the part of Christine perfectly.  She has an amazing voice.Patrick Wilson as Raoul also has a beautiful voice and is a great actor.  (But who in the world likes Raoul anyway?)The movie is unbelieveably beautiful visually, and with a 110 piece orcheastra the music is to die for.  (Which is what most viewers fall for anyway.)I recommend the Special Edition DVD to everyone thinking of buying the movie.  The ""Behind the Mask"" special feature is tearjerking for a true phan of the musical, and very informative.  The additional scene is an additional scene, not deleted from the movie, and features another great performance from Gerry Butler.  The three part ""Making of the Phantom of the Opera"" is really great.  It answered a lot of questions I had about decisions made by director Joel Schumacher and genius producer Andrew Lloyd Webber.  My guess is that it'll answer yours too.And finally, the secret special feature is hillarious.  It's a sing-a-long to the title song by the cast and crew of the film.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A21BKR3JEUMQM	jakisan	I had no experience or knowledge of the story of The Phantom of the Opera other than a CD of the Broadway production I inherited from my mother's estate, given to her by one of her Vancouver grandchildren who must have enjoyed the travelling version. Obviously it didn't impress me all that much since it disappeared in some garage sale or other. Forgive me, oh please forgive me!...Having seen the movie version of the Phantom of the Opera, I am a phan forever...my main criteria when watching a movie is how often I look at my watch...I didn't once; I was too busy worrying about how my fifteen year old son whom I'd forced to accompany me was taking in the experience...he was definately hooked for most of the show...that should be a review in itself...at the same time, I found that I was totally absorbed by the music and settings of the movie...hadn't a clue who Emmy Rossum or Gerard Butler or Patrick Wilson were...of course I recognized Simon Callow and Miranda Richardson...but they weren't the point...and they didn't intrude into the increasingly involved plot between Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum)and the Phantom (Gerard Butler)and Raoul (Patrick Wilson)...it's really a potboiler, cheap romance of a plot...so you have to get your thrills out of how it's presented; do you remember that high-school musical that the guy/girl you had a crush on had the lead in? That's the kind of vibes I felt coming out of the audience for the characters...which was amazing since this was a movie. So beyond the romance, the obvious physical romance between the Phantom and Christine, there is lots of glitter and glorious escapism and stuff that will make you glad you went to see the movie. It's absolute eye-candy and if you are a fan of wonderfully overwrought melancholy music that tends towards schmaltzy...you have found home.	5.0	Time Well Lost	2005-05-10	4	3	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2YDESWJL4P3WV	James A. Holland	"I have to say that I was left utterly inimpressed and totally uninspired by this latest version of the ""Phantom"".Let me be specific.I loved the cinematography....the producers did an absolutely splendid job with that.From beginning to end, this film is a visual master piece and much of my 3 star rating is based upon this premise.Other than this, there was really nothing too great about this film.Seeing as this is a musical, I was actually quite disappointed by the bland and downright insipid singers chosen to star in this film.First the female lead role of Christine:I admit that the young lady that was cast in the lead role had a pleasent enough voice for this sort of music, but, contrary to popular opinion, I was not overly impressed with her voice.I found her acting more involved and, frankly, better than her singing.The Phantom:This guy should restrict his singing to the local karaoke bars! From his tone, to his lack of musicality, his is easily the worst voice I've ever heard in a lead role of ANY play, musical or opera.Here again I've found the acting to be stronger than the singing...in this case the acting was exponentially more impressive as the singig was really just two steps from torrid.Again, the general populous was very taken by this guy based on his LOOKS!And that's the real problem here, they've chosen an attrative actor, who CAN NOT sing, to play the part of what is supposed to be a hiddeous phantom who CAN sing. The result being a handsome phantom with a hiddeous voice!!!! Way to go casting directors.The Vice Count:Well, here's another actor ill-chosen for the part he is to portray.For one, he looks more like a complete sissy whimp then the strong, heroic savior and lover of Christine.The guy has zero masculinity...visually nor vocally.He not only looks like a whimp, but is tenor voice is a weak and small one of no particular destinction whatsoever.Nothing like having to watch a whimpy, feminine looking guy with a small, non-descript voice cast in a part that is supposed to go to a heroic figure. That's akin to casting Johnny Depp (though a great actor) in the part of the Termintor or XXX. It just doesn't work!However; I'm not surpised as Hollywood no longer seems to be interested in manly looking actors, rather opting for boyish, weak and fem looking whimps.The rest of the cast was ok. Again, nothing stood out as particularily great.One of my biggest issues with this production is that they have altered the score and thus, removed the OPERA part from the equation.Traditionally, the operatic sequences in the ""Phantom"" are from FAUST or some other actual operatic work.Here; however, they've substituted an Opera for some fictional ""opera"", in english and all.How terribly bland and insipid the overall result.The exclusion of any real operatic sequences really hurt the overall, musical flair of the film.Overall, this film is decent and were it not for the fact that that the voices of the cast are so weak, it would have been incontrivertibly better.I've only watched this film once, as the monotony and banality of it all was such that I had no desire to watch it again.Serious musical or opera lovers beware...this is a lightweight Hollywood fare from beginning to end."	3.0	Not what I thought....	2005-06-24	11	4	7

""Wooden"" Raoul aside, the principal players lived up to the larger than life challenge of making the story believeable, in a way that the play did not. But a play is a play, and a film is a film: two totally different genres that ought not be compared. The film is a visual feast of glorious sights and beautiful sounds. I liked the evil sensuality of the Phantom, and the glowing Emmy Rossum's wide-eyed naivete played perfectly, and added that spark of life so necessary to all great films. I thought the outdoor scenes were some of the most exquisite in recent years. The softly falling snow, the hiding Phantom, the ""cold and monumental"" graveyard, and Christine's angelic, heartwrenching ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again""...not to mention Raoul in hot pursuit on horseback...now THAT's a tough act to follow! Let's not forget Minnie Driver's hilarious, self-absorbed ""Carlotta"", and the cool, steady, understated Miranda Richardson's Mme. Giry. ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is two and one-half hours of well-spent entertainment.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1HI30IBYX8WRS	"James E. ""The Phantom"""	"I first became a ""Phan"" last spring after hearing the original London cast and reading Gaston Leroux's novel.  Though I have unfortunately never had a chance to see the stage show, I have been eagerly awaiting this film from the moment I first found out it was being made.The roles were all very well-cast.  Emmy Rossum (Mystic River, The Day After Tomorrow) was absolutely perfect as the young ingenue Christine Daa&eacute;.  Her voice sounds pure and innocent, and her acting (I thought) was quite good, especially in the final scenes.  Gerard Butler (Timeline, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider 2) was a very convincing Phantom. (Incidentally, the Phantom's real name is Erik.)  Though his voice is nowhere near as spectacular as that of Michael Crawford (the original stage Phantom), his acting skill more than makes up for any weaknesses in the singing department.  My only complaint with his character is that the makeup under the mask is not the least bit ugly, but that's the fault of the makeup artists.  Patrick Wilson (The Alamo, Angels in America) brought much more depth to the character of Raoul than most other actors who played the role.  Now, he's no longer just a ""pretty-boy,"" but actually gets to prove that he deserves Christine's love just as much as Erik does.  Additionally, the fact that Raoul is now a tenor and the Phantom is a baritone makes Raoul sound more ""heroic,"" voice-wise.  I thought that was a rather nice touch.  Minnie Driver was absolutely hilarious as the diva Carlotta.  Though she didn't do any singing during the film (that was dubbed by trained opera singer Margaret Preece), her comedic timing and diva-ish attitude made her extremely fun to watch.  I see a very bright future in film for all of these actors.I thought the film was extremely well-directed.  The sets are simply gorgeous, the camera angles are just about perfect in almost every scene, and the additional scenes that were not in the stage musical further the plot and give it a much deeper emotional center.  Andrew Lloyd Webber definitely made the right choice when he hired Joel Schumacher to bring his masterpiece to the screen.  My overall favorite scenes are probably ""Point of No Return,"" the Overture, ""Music of the Night,"" and the climax in the Phantom's lair.I highly reccomend this film to theater-lovers everywhere.  If you loved the musical (or even if you didn't), see this film with an open mind.  Who knows?  You, too, may grow to love the poor, unhappy Erik."	5.0	A Theatrical Masterpiece	2005-05-03	8	6	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2QXLPVEJBD4CN	James McWilliams	I had heard over the years the story of the phantom of the opera, and I was aware of the older version of the film starring, I believe, Lon Chaney, but I had never taken much interest in it.  Not that I don't enjoy some musicals, I have never thought of musicals as the kind of serious film that interests me.  I was introduced to this musical version of The Phantom of the Opera by my daughter, who rented it at a video store and invited me to watch it.  The opening scene of the film creates such a wonderful nostalgia, Emily Rossum is as lovely in her part as she is superb in her singing, and the story itself goes deep into the human psyche.  I don't own very many films, but this one so impressed me that I bought it to own it and share it with friends.  I have seen so many films I have forgotten many of them, but this one to me was unforgettable.	5.0	An exceptional motion picture.	2009-09-12	0	0	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AQQFI7YHMRL7S	James Morris	"I expect 400,000 negative votes for this review.  Fine.  I am not disappointed that this film is so bad; what I find horrifying is that this drivel has so many devoted fans.  I don't know what's more frightening - that so many people consider this ""high art"" or the sad fact that so many seem to confuse it with real opera.  The very word ""opera"" in the title is an insult to the good names of Puccini and Verdi.In my youth, I had marginally enjoyed Jesus Christ Superstar, and thought that Evita was fine theatre.  But I hated Sunset Boulevard, and have no thought of ever seeing that ubiquitous tourist-trap, Cats.  After 38 years of attending Broadway, and seeing dozens of musicals, I have come to loathe the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber, and the score and story of the Phantom of the Opera above all.  If you are still reading, let me explain why.I believe that Mr. Webber epitomizes exactly what is wrong with modern Broadway musicals.  His music never advances beyond trite, overly sentimental commercial fluff.  The singsong structure of his formulaic melodies and their contrived, adolescent lyrics are apt to get stuck in your head for days, while almost never managing to advance the storyline or explain the character's motivations.  At best, his style is derivative; the melody line for Music of the Night sounds suspiciously to me like portions of Puccini's La Fanciulla del West, and in spots, I hear poor imitations of La Boheme.  At his worst, I get the feeling that he writes with one eye on his checkbook and both ears tuned to the latest trends in top-forty radio.  When I listen to anything Webber, my mind's ear automatically hears Celine Dion and Britney Spears, stripped of even the bare modicum of taste that their least commercial endeavors have to offer.  Not only are his lyricist's poorly structured songs devoid of wit and ingenuity, they frequently leave the action dead in the water.  Worst of all, they pander to the mentality of a nation reared on reality TV, empty pop tunes and American Idols.I saw Phantom on Broadway.  When the final curtain came down and the applause subsided, I realized with great sadness that today's Broadway audience seems content with smoke, mirrors, and special effects.  I kept marveling that so much applause could be wasted on a show built around a chandelier and bad pop songs.  The lyrics often make no sense at all, when they manage every so often to rhyme, they grab hold like there's no tomorrow, refusing to let go.  Sondheim it's not; in fact, for my money, they've got a way to go to overtake Jerry Herman, or even the long-forgotten composers of Happy Hunting.Then there are the plot holes; for lack of unlimited space, let's cover just a few.  Christine apparently has lived in the opera house since being orphaned.  I didn't know anyone had ever lived in an opera house, but why not?  If the story is to be taken seriously, one has to wonder how Christine's father came to repose in an opulent crypt, while she was forced to mature in the squalor of a dressing room, which is about all I ever really learned about her.  Anyway, Christine believes that the Phantom is an Angel of Music, despite his demonic, cryptic notes bearing sinister demands, and resorting to murderous acts of vandalism when he doesn't get his way, like a petulant child.  At one point, we learn that he was rescued as a boy from being a caged circus freak and hidden in the bowels of the opera house, where he's spent his entire existence (think The Elephant Man, without any real drama or character development).  He is described as, ""a genius, an architect, a composer and a magician"", but there is no explanation of how he came to develop these talents while spending his youth hidden in catacombs, with apparently no formal education.After the intermission - rarely have I seen a movie musical that made it plainer where Act Two began on stage - Bravo! - he shows up at a New Year's masquerade, interrupting (thank God) the most insufferable musical number in my memory.  I believe that the Phantom's entrance in the Masquerade scene was the only way Mr. Webber could write his way out of the dizzying spiral momentum and endless repetition of that God-awful melody.  Although he recently murdered one of the employees of the opera house, none of the hundreds of people present think to rush and detain him, even though it is finally obvious that he is certainly no specter.  He then presents the theatre management with a new ""opera"", which they agree to stage with little discussion.  The score, by the way, is full of utterly ridiculous ""operatic scenes"" that would ring false to even the most casual opera patron; I would expect them to be laughed off the stage of any legitimate opera house of the past three centuries.  More puzzling still is why the Phantom champions the career of Christine over the diva Carlotta, when it is clear (or should be to anyone with ears) that at least Carlotta manages a few high C's, while Christine possesses the instrument of a second-rate 20th century pop singer.  This is a story about ""opera"" professionals, and a Phantom obsessed with opera?  There were more plausible opera moments in the 1962 Hammer film, which wasn't even a musical.  And there was far more horror in the Lon Chaney classic, which managed, even in 1925, to avoid the gigantic leaps of logic required by the ludicrous narrative presented here.The biggest plot hole gnawed at me like a rat in a garbage can.  The Viscount Raoul is supposed to be in love with Christine, and she him, their bliss threatened only by the presence of the menacing Phantom.  Like the proverbial Knight in Shining Armor, we never learn ANYTHING about Raoul, except that he is from ""a powerful and wealthy family"".  If he is truly powerful and wealthy, and so very much in love, why doesn't he simply take Christine away from the opera house to escape the Phantom?  Was the rent on her dressing room paid too far in advance, one wonders?  Of course, then there would be no story.  Story?  What story?  The hundreds of fans of the show who complain how much this film has ruined their beloved ""best musical of all time"", never seem to notice that the movie script at least bothered to flesh out the plot a hundredfold over the stage production, and it STILL has almost no story, and even less logic.If you remove the special effects and gooey love songs, this celebration of everything that is wrong with Broadway today collapses under the weight of its own inadequacies.  I give the film two stars for its sumptuous costumes and lavish sets, but if this can pass as ""the best musical ever written"" as so many seem to think, God help the future of Broadway."	1.0	A Phantom of an Opera	2007-02-06	52	21	31

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3OQV8UQDM4GYC	"James Wehr ""Jamie"""	The Phantom of the Opera is the most AMAZING movie I have ever seen. Ever since I saw it its been all I think about. I have seen 3 times so far and I cant wait for thte 4th, 5th, and however many lol. The cast was just brilliant, Emmy Rossum has one of the most phuenominal voices I have ever heard and plays Christine Daae so well, she just amazing. Gerald Butler played the most enticing Phantom. Tall, dark, mysterious, and sexy all in one, with a voice that could melt anyones soul, stupendous. Now I have never seen the stage production but I have heard the original casr recording and I prefer the new voices to the old ones anyday.Leave it to Andrew Lloyd Webber to take an already spectacular thing and turn it into something even more spectacular, having him work on the movie really helped keep the integrity of the story intact, it would not have been the same if he hadnt been a part of it.In conclusion all I can say is GO SEE THIS. See it once and get caught in its spell, and trust me this is not a spell u want to get out of.	5.0	Amazing	2005-02-20	5	5	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2SZFHWX92NQ5F	Jamy Shaffer	"Some musicals were meant to be transformed to the silver screen (Chicago was excellant, the classic Rodgers & Hammerstein shows, and several others).  Unfortunately, not Phantom.  The movie just took away too much from the experience of seeing the phenomenon on stage where you actually sit in front of the performers as it happens night after night live.  The magic is lost on the screen.  However, that being said, there was some good in the movie.  The background scene in which Madame Giri tells Raoul about the young child who became the Phantom was nice.  Since the beginning, I have always felt that the casting of the title character was way off.  Why cast a young, handsome man when everyone knows that he is to be portrayed much older than Christine and be disfigured.  He is supposed to be a substitute for her dead father.  I have often wondered why Michael Crawford was not offered the role.  However, Emmy Rossum does do a fine job as Christine.  Patrick Wilson is fine as Raoul; I never liked the part...too boring.  I do not know if a different casting would have helped at all, but if you really want the Phantom experience, make the trip to see the magic of the ""Music of the Night"" on stage."	3.0	Much Better On Stage	2005-08-06	6	2	4
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1RECBDKHVOJMW	"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana"""	"Andrew Lloyd Webber's music has given me much pleasure over the years. I live in Manhattan, and although I don't usually go to Broadway musicals unless I hear rave reviews, I saw ""Phantom of the Opera,"" and loved it. Director Joel Schumacher's film production is simply terrific, although somewhat flawed! I admit it is a bit bombastic at times, but the music is spectacular, as are the sets, cast and acting. I don't want to compare screen versus stage versions.They are totally different mediums and each lends unique and special moments. I have heard some call the film vulgar, and I say ""Boo"" on their snobbishness!As most know, this is a bizarre beauty and the beast kind of love story. Set in 1870's Paris, a talented, mysterious genius with a terribly scarred face lives in secret beneath the opera house, haunting the building, and those who spend much time there, with his spectral presence. Frequently heard from but never seen, he composes brilliant music, writes operas, designs sets, etc.. His life of solitude and bitterness have driven him mad. Unbeknownst to any, he has been lovely, young soprano Christine Daae's mentor and voice teacher since her childhood. The young woman believes that he is her beloved deceased father's spirit and calls him her ""angel of music."" He has grown to love the innocent ingenue with the exquisite voice. When the two appear together the ambiance is shadowed and otherworldly, and Christine always seems hypnotized - which is quite credible given the Phantom's sheer force of personality. One night the Prima Donna walks out on a performance and Christine takes her place. When Raoul, a wealthy young nobleman, (Patrick Wilson), sees the extraordinary young singer, he falls in love. The Phantom does not take competition lightly.Schumacher's production is fantastically gothic, as is Gaston Leroux's novel, upon which all opera phantoms are based. Gerard Butler, as the deformed anti-hero, is the epitome of the dominant Gothic Hero. He would be superb as Mr. Rochester or Heathcliff.....but I digress. Let it suffice to say he makes a superior ""Phantom of the Opera."" Although I very much like his voice, some say it does not measure up to the rest of the casts'. Mr. Butler, however, more than makes-up for any lack of vocal power with his charisma, virility and powerful stage presence. He uses eroticism and sensuality to seduce, perfectly, especially when he brings Christine to his lair, deep in the watery depths beneath the opera house, and sings ""Music of the Night.""  ""Touch me, trust me / savour each sensation!"" And, ""Open up your mind / let your fantasies unwind / in this darkness which you know you cannot fight."" He smolders in ""Point of No Return,"" which is one very steamy number. There are times when I see Butler's Phantom as a vampire-like figure - a dark, deeply handsome, all powerful vampire - not a ghoulish one. With his slicked back dark wig, tux, sensual lips and mask, he looks a forceful figure from the underworld - (which he is) - beckoning Christine to leave the ""garish light of day,"" and come, ""Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before! / Let your soul take you where you long to be! / Only then can you belong to me."" In the scene where he spies on Christine and Raoul on the opera roof, hiding amidst the gargoyles, he picks up the rose she has dropped in the snow and holds it to his lips. Almost everything in the shot is black and white except for the red rose at his mouth...like drops of blood. That's vampire-like!! (reminiscent of Frank Langella's 1970's Dracula, not Bela Lugosi's).Eighteen year-old Emmy Rossum is absolutely luminous as Christine. The sound of her spectacular, opera-trained voice is alone worth the price of the DVD. Ms. Rossum is a talented actress, and her innocent fresh look is a perfect compliment to Butler's dark, menacing specter, and Patrick Wilson's handsome swashbuckling viscount. Wilson's romantic handsomeness and fabulous tenor voice make him an exceptional choice for the hero part. The real taut passion, however, is between Butler and Rossum. This magnetic force between them is one aspect of the movie I prefer over the play. The phantom is cast as a much older man in the stage production, and when he is unmasked one feels totally repulsed, and not very sympathetic. He becomes merely one more aging man lusting after a young woman. Also, Christine knows him so well that perhaps she doesn't see him as quite the monster the audience does. There are qualities she has been drawn to, before she saw his whole face. Her empathy is not totally destroyed by the grotesque image. The younger, handsomer version of the Phantom permits a certain believable ambivalence in her feelings, which makes for more tension in the storyline.Andrew Lloyd Weber collaborated closely with Schumacher throughout the making of the movie. The supporting cast is excellent with Miranda Richardson as Mme. Giry, Ciaran Hinds as Fermin, Simon Callow as Andre, and Minnie Driver as Carlotta, the spoiled diva. Although Ms. Driver is hilarious in her role, she spends too much time, with too many lines, onstage. The campiness works well as comic relief. However, the effect is lost with an overabundance of this and becomes kitsch.Finally, buy the 2-Disc Special, when purchasing the DVD. The second disc, approximately 45 minutes, is entitled ""Behind the Mask: The Story of The Phantom of the Opera,"" and documents the journey from Gaston Leroux's novel to the silent film, to Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage version, and finally to Joel Schumacher's feature film. Included in this documentary are interviews with the principals. There are also several wonderful clips from early performances that took place at Andrew Lloyd Webber's estate before the musical was completed. Also included is an excised scene which features Gerard Butler as the Phantom, singing his part in ""No One Would Listen.""JANA"	5.0	A Spectacular Cinema Extravaganza With Superb Music & Cast!	2005-06-04	11	8	3

It is truly a visual and audio feast.  Now I have the dvd.  I so love it.  The two disc version has many terrific extras.  The history of the Phantom of the Opera includes snippets of performances from the early stages of the play and tells some of the changes that were made.  I found that very interesting.  The Making of the Movie was even more fascinating with a focus on how the cast was selected and the technical aspects of the film.  There were interviews with the cast and an hilarious cast and crew sing a long.  One of the highlights for me was the new song, Noone Would Listen sung by Gerard Butler.The acting is superb in this tragic love story, especially Gerard Butler who portrays the Phantom.  He is darkly mysterious in the beginning but as the story progresses, he descends into madness.  In the end he will break your heart.  His voice is a rich and beautifully expressive rock and roll tenor that soars on its own but also blends perfectly with the other two leads.  Emmy Rossum was born to play Christine.  She has a beautiful voice and is a lovely actress.  Patrick Wilson is a perfect Raoul in a role that is much expanded from the stage play.  Minnie Driver is wonderful as Carlotta and Miranda Richardson creates a compassionate Madame Giry.I loved this movie and highly recommend the dvd.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1R71EER14ES5V	Janeite &#60;3	"Since this was the same price as the full screen edition, I went ahead and bought this 2-Disk edition. And it was definitely worth it. The second disk is pretty good, but not as long as I would have liked. (I think all those special extented Lord of the Rings dvds has spoiled me for good). While I was originally more of a fan of the actors and actresses involved in the movie and for the cinematography, I found the history of the play very interesting. The old footage of original rehearsals was a nice addition and the behind the scenes footage of the movie was good as well. I also like to know the original story behind a movie so I can see where the writers or directors made changes and why. This is one of those movies that gets better each time you watch it. Be sure to look for the easter egg on the second disk that has a cast and crew sing-a-long the ""The Phantom of the Opera"". It'll make you laugh. The only thing I would really have liked to see was a commentary on the movie. This is one of those movies that would have really been interesting to listen to the commentary on.Finally, I have to add that while I am a big Gerry Butler fan and think he did an awsome job, Emmy Rossum was the shining star in this. Her reactions to the Phantom were so flawless and it didn't seem like she was acting at all. She had so much expression and wonder in her eyes. Great job!"	5.0	Worth the money	2005-08-26	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2418VGZYYKOEX	Janet Iacolino	"He made him sexy, sad, scary,angry,bitter and vibrant and you got to know the phantom. In spite of his lust, manipulation and control, you end up loving the phantom anyway and how much he was in love with Christine. Gerard's voice ""fit"" this phantom perfectly. I wish he sees all the positives about his performance and ignore the critics negative, they are so shallow. They just don't get it. You felt the phantom's emotions all the time which brought us, the audience, deeper into the story and the phantom's personality. Acting with words, and singing a story are two different things, he was still able to bring out the characters emotions and that is a rare thing to see. His performance was brilliant. Even though I am posting this years after the movie was made and have the DVD,and watched it many times, this movie and soundtrack are still selling 10 yrs later. Never tiring to watch. Pertaining to the rest of the cast, a job well done!!This movie is set to be a timeless classic, and will stay in your hearts forever."	5.0	Gerard Butler's performance is brilliant!!!

I'm angry that they killed ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and ""Music of the Night"".  Emmy Rossum looks like a reject from the Rocky Horror Picture Show and rides a horse through the bowls of the opera house. She also looks like she got drugged with something during ""Music of the Night"". I will purchase the movie because I can skip these horrible two numbers, which is a shame because these two songs are two of my favorites. The sets and costumes are great, the supporting actors (not the three primary ones) make the movie worth watching.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1C08KLFIHSJMZ	Jason G.	This film adaption of the longest running musical in Broadway history does the show justice, and provides the viewer with many memorable numbers that will no doubt stay with them for quite some time.All of the performances are first rate. Emmy Rossum has the voice of an angel and despite some jabs from the critics I believe Butler did a phenomenal job as the phantom. His deep, rough and yes, imperfect voice was a perfect pitch to play the deeply troubled Phantom. Depsite the somewhat hollow role Patrick Wilson turns in a good performance Raoul, and one can tell of his Broadway experience by his polished vocals and fluid demeanor on screen.As for the visuals, this is the area which I believe the film adaption outdoes the musical. The costumes, sets, lighting and special effects are completley breathtaking-- you'll want to view this DVD on the biggest screen possible to fully enjoy the eye popping colors and textures.So until you can get to New York to see the stage version yourself, snatch up this DVD quickly and enjoy one of the most classic shows of all time!	5.0	The next best thing to seeing the show	2006-03-19	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1MTW9XNYCQBGT	Jazz	Seriously...what's the big deal?I've never seen the stage show, but I bet it was a whole lot better than the film. I expected to be treated to a fabulous musical, much on the scale of 'Chicago' and 'Moulin Rouge.' Instead, I was treated to an ameatur technical filming of a fabulous set.There are plenty of shots where you can actually see the shadow of the camera, and the editing and photography of certain shots left me confused and dissapointed.The actors are too young, too bland for their roles. The music was overbearing and somewhat annoying. The plot seemed to draw out endlessly, the corpses of the actors didn't help. All of these actors are EXCELLENT actors, but their talent has been wasted on this film.Joel Schumacher too is an excellent director, he just seemed to get lost on this one.The sets and costumes are brilliant, I will say that. They're the only aspect that saved the production.Meanwhile, I respect those that enjoy it so wonderfully, I just don't understand why.	2.0	...I don't get it	2005-05-29	12	4	8

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AV81BKPO5SVD5	J. Beers	"I thought: ""The Phantom of the Opera at last on film...Wow!""  I couldn't wait to get the DVD and view it on my Widescreen TV. OK, granted, the production values are superb - but all efforts are wasted in the hands of director Shumacher.  The viewer is not allowed to savor any scene or set piece without being disconcerted by the MTV style jump cutting.  Once or twice, the camera relaxes - as in the Cemetery scene - and we sadly experience the missed potential of the whole.Plotwise, all changes from stage to film are acceptable, with one exception: The face of The Phantom.  This charming guy could have certainly gone about society with a simple patch on his eye.  And, with his multi-talents been accepted in the finest circles in Paris at that time.  Therefore, the unmasking scene is a bust.  Also, there is nothing to indicate that he is MAD!The entire cast is fine, and under the mastery of a director like Milos Forman (think Amadeus) they would have shone brightly in a modern day classic.  Instead the audience gets a two hour-plus, pop video.  What a shame.Something is wrong with a DVD package where the extras are better than the film itself.  Scenes from various stage productions are electrifying.  One wishes one of these stagings were taped and offered to the public.Reading the above reviews, I realize that I am in the minority.  To each his own."	1.0	Didn't want to hate it!	2005-05-03	20	9	11
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1ULMFI7GNVPZM	"J. Beins ""Diversity Encouraged"""	This is a brilliant reimagining of the Phantom story for a new audience.  Those who consider the Crawford/Brightman Broadway Phantom as sacrosanct - well go in another room with your soundtrack and enjoy.  For the rest of us this FILM version is magnificent.  Emmy Rossum is innocent and pure with a lovely voice and Gerard Butler is fantastic, sexy and powerful as the spiritually disfigured Phantom.  It is irrelivant if his face and form is to die for with or without the mask, the point is it is his spirit that has become the disfiguring obstacle to his love for Christine.  And I for one LOVE his passionate and emotional rendering of the music against Raoul's perfect tenor and Christine's lovely soprano.  There have been many versions of the Phantom before and doubtless will be others in the future.  This is MY Phantom and I love it!	5.0	Amazing	2005-02-16	4	4	0

That said, I would still rate &#34;Les Miserables (2012)&#34; with five stars.  This version of Phantom of the Opera looked 40 years old, rather than a cutting edge movie from 2004.  I didn't enjoy the acting.  It was hard to relate to the actors.  The emotion was over dramatized and didn't feel real.	3.0	meh	2013-07-22	1	0	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3S2C3TTSH2TX4	"J. D. ""Jack"""	"If I could give this movie ten stars I would; it's a shame we're only allowed five.I rented this movie on the recommendation of my aunt; her only complaint was that it was too long. On the contrary, if the movie had been as long as the Lord of Rings trilogy, I would have watched it in it's entirety without complaint.With that said, I will list those things that I truly loved about the movie. Be warned, there are spoilers:1. Butler was magnificent and mysterious as Phantom, aka Eric. Many professional singers have snubbed him.......let them. I'm not an ""artist"", but nonetheless, thought his singing was jaw-dropping. (I'm going to buy the soundtrack too)  He was no Michael Crawford, but who cares! I can think of many movies that were re-done with new actors and were masterpieces, i.e. Robert Powell from Jesus of Nazareth to James Caviezel in ""The Passion..."" (obviously those weren't musicals, but you get my point). His singing was powerful, full of yearning, raw at times, angry, passionate, and reaches into your soul (especially if you're a woman).2.  Gerard was younger in the movie than the book version... WHO CARES, he was old enough to be a father figure/mentor, and young enough to be a romantic interest. Yuck, who wants to see a fifty year old seduce a teenager.3.  Rossum and Wilson were great, except for Rossum's continuous trance-like expression almost throughout the entire movie. I didn't like Raoul's character as most people, but only because he took Christine away from Phantom. I found many reviewers calling him wimpy. That is hardly the case, from the beginning of the movie, he fearlessly attempted to be her guardian, that's hardly spineless.4. Loved the flashback sequences, especially the beginning, it was spine-tingling, you're thinking... oh boy, we're in for a wonderful ride.5. I had no problem with Eric/Phantom having only a quarter of his face deformed. Many negative reviewers critized this saying he looked like he had only a ""skin rash"". Oh brother, what an understatement. If this man were walking down the street, whether it be 1800 or the present time, there was ENOUGH deformity to draw attention and probably scare many people.6.  I loved the fact that although this man is deformed, obsessive, selfish (until the end) and kills, you still want him to end up with the girl!! What's even more disturbing, many of us would still want him.7. The sets were beautiful and mesmerizing; the music is still swimming in my head, and will be for some time.Now for the things I didn't like or didn't understand about the movie:1. The masquerade scene didn't give enough ""glory"" to the phantom as it should have; his ""entrance"" wasn't spectacular as it should have been.2. Didn't like the Phantom losing the swordfight. What is that all about; he is supposed to be invincible, always escaping and having something up his sleeve.3. Why does she sneak out to visit her father's grave? Raoul was right there guarding the door, yet she snuck by him. Was she secretely hoping that the Phantom would show up?4.  She seemed too fickle, to coin the phrase ""love the one you're with"". But then, it is a movie about a love triangle.5.  During the ""Point of No Return"" the camera kept going to the dancers in the background. They were terrible, dancing grotesquely (if thats even a word) and a distraction; it broke the momentum of Phantom and Christine. Everytime I watch this scene, it's like hurry up, go back to P & C.6.  Why would Phantom give her Raoul's engagement ring, after he has abducted her, you'd think he'd have his own special ring for her, after all he had everything else.Someone made an excellent point earlier that it was only at the end that Eric/Phantom truly loved Christine. Only after Christine ""commits"" to Phantom, puts on the ring while wearing the wedding dress, kisses him tenderly while caressing his deformed face, does he give her up, displaying the ultimate act of love. She gives him the ring back in the next scene. Was that to signify that she was really ""his"" inwardly, and outwardly going with Raoul, or was it her way of saying goodbye, here is a momento of what we had.  You really feel like Christine would have gone with phantom had he not been murderous and so obsessive.Lastly, the scene at the graveyard, Raoul, very sorrowful, leaves the Persian Monkey with Cymbals on her gravestone. Is he at that moment finally conceding that Phantom owned her heart, by giving Christine one of Phantom's most prized posessions? I have to wonder since the very next scene we see the rose and the ring.Well, that is my interpretation. This movie leaves the viewers with questions thus leaving it to you to interpret (like what happened to Phantom after he exits at end? What was the marriage like, was it happy? Did Phantom ever contact her again).I wish ALW had used more creative license and changed the ending, but then, that's just me. (I know I'll get blasted for making this statement) I think most Phantom fans would have hated that. I like Hollywood endings, there's enough sadness in the real world to deal with.Despite my criticism, I highly recommend this movie and buying it. It's at the top of my Christmas list!"	5.0	Bring a box of kleenex	2005-11-14	12	10	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2VKCY619WN6OT	"Jeff Jones ""willys36"""	"This has to be the best movie ever made!  A wonderful rendition of ALW's magical stage play I can find zero fault with it.  Some say Gerry Butler is no Michael Crawford, which is true.  Michael was the perfect stage choice where singing voice is everything (incidentally, when he got that gig, he was a total un-known, acting on a BBC 1/2hr comedy show.  No one knew he could sing).  However, his acting ability is not suited for the silver screen.  I submit his performance in the forgettable Disney's ""Condor Man"" as evidence of that.  Gerry brought just the right edginess in his singing voice which combined with his superb acting talents resulted in the definitive Phantom performance.  Emmy was angelic.  Minnie was the perfect Diva, and Pat Wilson fleshed out Raoul as a real he-man.The most striking message that comes screaming though in the movie is lonliness.  All the major characters are desparate for companionship which eludes them most of their lives.  Even the lone deer running along Raoul's carriage symolizes that theme.  That makes Christine and Raoul's true love even more impactful.This goes on the shelf next to Family Vacation, the Pink Panther series, American Graffiti, and Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World as often watches.After seeing it 6 times in the theater and 3 times on one of my 3 DVDs, the only flaw I can find is Christine goes to sleep to Music of the Night in Phantoms lair with her panty-hose on and wakes up with them off.  Probably had to get up during the night to pee I guess.PS.  I keep editing this!  The new song ""Learn to be Lonely"" was mis-interpreted, otherwise would have been a sure Oscar winner.  It took me a while to figure out why it didn't quite work in the movie but then it dawned on me - it was done as a 60s folk tune!  It is backed up with a single guitar and bongo drum which just doesn't go with the rest of the lush score.  The tune was much better in the ""No One Will Listen"" deleted scene with full orchestration."	5.0	A perfect movie!	2005-05-24	4	3	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A115K5VK69VTAN	Jeff M. Pierce	"As an avid theatre-goer, I have seen many musicals throughout my life.  The first musical I ever saw was ""Phantom of the Opera"".  So I became enthralled when the movie was to be coming out.  However, to my disappointment, the movie is lost in the visual spectacle that isn't even all the great to begin with.  Why Lloyd Weber chose Schumacher as the director for this film is beyond my reasoning.  Did he see ""Batman Forever""?  Honestly, the entire movie lacks the emotional power of the stage production, as well as the talent.  The voices are bad, the acting is horrific, and the overall structure is slow moving and robotic.  The actors knew nothing about musical performance.  This is why I give this movie such a bad rating."	1.0	See the Show - Don't buy the movie	2005-03-04	35	9	26
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3G0TG1JR5C2BT	Jeffrey W. Prescott	This movie is the second of Andrew Lloyd Webbers films to hit the big screen in a major production.  It is an impressive attempt with intricate costumes and brillant sets.  The main issue here is the story line and singing.  The story-line has been changed dramatically in the details and in certain areas of the plot.  Characters have also been changed and given more depth then they needed to get the overall story across.  Now, for the music.  The singing is mediocre to say the least.  Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman set an amazing standard that I do not even expect to be emmulated by other singers, but at least try to make an effort to make it good.  Gerard Butler was horribly miscast and is not even the right vocal type given people who have sung this role in the theatre.  The girl who plays Christine looks the part but does not have the brilliant voice that is needed and the score enables her voice to not be effective at all.  The score is the other main issue, it was lowered and altered to meet medocre singers and their vocal requierments which is wrong.  This was done for Madonna in Evita and it has been done again, this took away from the movie and from the emotional effect that it should have had.  The only real saving graces musically are Minnie Driver and Miranda Richardson, brilliant stage actresses and they were the best part.  If you loved the broadway show, you will be let down buy this movie.	3.0	Beautifully done, vocally distraught	2004-12-09	4	0	4

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A18REH4U5V2I5K	"J. E. Lewis ""jayell6329 Phantom Phan"""	"Anyone who doesn't like this movie probably doesn't like much of anything.  It is visually beautiful and full of emotion.  I have the soundtrack of the original play with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman; I also saw the play on Broadway with other actors.  Frankly, I think the movie is better.  Emmy Rossum sings like the innocent she is portraying and her voice is clear and sweet.  Patrick Wilson has a nice tenor and is believable as her young suitor, ready to conquer the world for her. (Loved the hair!!)  However, it is Gerald Butler who steals the show; he should be called the ""Man of a thousand faces"" and looks different in every movie I've seen him in.  He freely admitted in an interview that he's not a singer; in fact, he had to take a crash course in vocalizing to sing the part.  Given that bit of information, I think he did a fine job and his acting is superb. The only complaint is that it must have been hard to make him look bad, given his Scottish good looks. I was rooting for the Phantom for most of the movie, and I wouldn't mind if he wanted to lock me up in his dungeon. He is extremely seductive in the part, and I can't think of anyone in Hollywood who could have done a better job. With his mask, the Phantom is powerful, commanding, fearsome and magical.  Without it, he is like most of the rest of us in the world--weak, vulnerable, and emotionally fragile.  Minnie Driver was a bit of comic relief, as were the 2 owners of the opera, who made a fortune in ""scrap metal"" (junk).

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3BPVMRZ6MDZKN	"jen marie ""jen marie"""	I was very surprised when  I first watched the movie.  Most of the reviews I have read of it were actually bad- this was on rottentomatoes.com and yahoo.  The movie, however, while I have not seen the live version, is very good.  The earlier reviewer who said it was romantic and the voices were very good is correct.  Gerard Butler brings a sensitivity and intensity to the phantom that made my breathe catch- my favorite song- Music of the Night- was fabulous.  Emily Rossum is beautiful and when she sings the song Think of me it is absolutely beautiful- the diamond pins in her hair and the dress!!  Her voice is perfect and the emotions she gives to the performance are lovely.  The score is intact and it is beautiful. The ending is so good- and when the phantom leaves - you can feel his emotions.  It is wonderful.	5.0	A very good film	2005-05-14	5	4	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1UC3RFQAOF8G4	Jenn	I adore this movie. I've seen the original production and I own the London cast recording of this musical and I thought for sure they had made a huge mistake on casting this. Boy was I WRONG. Gerard Butler plays the role of the Phantom so wonderfully, I honestly don't know how you could watch the movie without falling under his spell or without crying for the man. He gives so much emotion to a very complex character and pulls it off wonderfully. Emmy plays the conflicted Christine very well, also. Patrick Wilson almost made me LIKE Raoul- almost, but not quite. Erik and Christine FOREVER! Sorry, patrick :P. Minny driver plays the wonderful Sanish diva, Carlotta. Even though her voice is dubbed (Let's face it, not every person can be so slightly out of tune to make us all cringe, trust me, I know, I'm a performer) she plays a spoiled diva used to getting her way very well and makes everyone in the audience laugh, you can't help not to. The managers are also comic relief. I don't know what else to say. Just GO SEE THIS MOVIE!	5.0	*sings* I'm under his spell..........	2005-01-27	6	3	3
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2DCO4JLNSHPZR	Jennifer Brownston	I have trusted professional reviewers (mostly) for a number of years and nearly missed the best movie of my life! Because I loved the stage play, I intended to see Phantom, but I didn't RUSH to see it.  If I had known how wonderful it was, how much better than the play, how perfectly cast and how sexy Gerard Butler was, I would have seen it at the first available opportunity.  As it is, I was only able to see it 13 times before it left my theater!  What a sad loss!  No one I've asked didn't like the movie.  Am so looking forward to the DVD, but will miss my beloved story and music coming from a t.v. instead of a 30 ft. high movie screen. If you have a chance, catch the movie.  If not, by all means buy the DVD. If you get the chance, do both!	5.0	Stupid to Listen to Negative Reviews	2005-04-05	3	3	0

After hearing Brighton and Crawford on the original soundtrack my expectations were high, but they really pulled it off with this DVD. Rossum is no Brightman, but she does have a beautiful voice and Patrick Wilson, wow! What a beautiful tenor voice he has!I liked the way the movie starts out when Raoul is old and remembering, and ends that way, too. Great touch. This retelling of the story is a little different, but again, they really pulled it off and did a great job. There has never been a more beautiful score than The Phantom of the Opera. Andrew Lloyd Weber is a genius.	5.0	Wonderful!	2007-09-16	2	1	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A12SZHA44T0ZAZ	"Jennifer Dulo ""Gwenhwyfar"""	Many people will complain that this version isn't good because Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford didn't perform as the Phantom and Christine. Well, I'm a phanatic. I own 6 books, 5 movies, and 11 soundtracks, and this is one of the best versions of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical that I've heard. No, it cannot compare to the live Broadway show, but it is definately one of the most emotional, most in-depth, best adaptation that I've seen. Gerard James Butler, Emmanuelle Grey Rossum, and Patrick Wilson all did an amazing job with the music. I'm proud to be the generation this was made for. @-P---	5.0	I love it!	2006-01-03	5	5	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2IXV2QW0A8U3F	Jennifer French	After years of waiting, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is now available to own.  Truly a remarkable musical with drama, romance and a touch of tragedy, it is everything a muscial should be.  The cast is well played out, even though they had big shoes to fill.  Gerald Butler is a wonderful Phantom.  He brings a sexiness and youth to the role that previous Phantom I've seen did not.  You really do feel his obessive love for Christine and his pain when she betrays him.  Emmy Rossum is a wonderful Christine.  Emmy is a beautiful young lady who sings remarkably well.  It actually was more difficult for me to accept her as Christine than Butler as Phantom because this role was created specifically for Sarah Brightman.  However, Sarah is too old for the role now and Emmy does the job just as well.  Patrick Wilson (Raoul) was the one role I thought could have been improved in the movie.  I think they could have added a little star appeal to the movie and cast a hotter actor.  They dubbed Minnie Driver's voice, so dubbing another wouldn't have been that big of a deal.Overall, this movie has heart and keeps the spirit of the stage production.  The staging of this movie is simply stunning.  Minnie Driver's Carlotta adds for comic relief, as well as the opera house owners.The extras include a behind the scenes on how the show came to life.  It includes home videos of early productions and rehearsals with Sarah and Michael Crawford.  Truly, for this Phantom fan, this made the entire purchase sooooo worth it.  If you are a fan, definitely own this work.	5.0	Excellent Movie, Wonderful Extras	2005-05-06	3	2	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AJHC8SJDXDSXV	Jennifer Pillow Taylor	To quote the Canadian comedy Red Green, 'The fact that they can't sing distracts people from the fact that they can't act.'Except that was talking about Camelot, which is much more enjoyable.The movie would have been far better if they found more enthusiastic and more skilled actors, like a bunch of fourth graders.Its as if the directors went to the greatest lengths to make sure the characters were their woodenest, they were spectacularly unattractive, and that the scenes were not only undramatic, but that they consisted mostly of standing around, walking in circles, and screaming like drowning cats in heat.The only thing mildly intriguing is the costumes, but if you bought any generic costume book about this story, you can get that.	1.0	Coul be used as corporal and psychological punishment	2009-03-06	14	5	9

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ASKV3EF16Y8KB	Jeromy A. Felts	"Many times the rumors have flown about trying to put the ""Phantom"" broadway show on the big screen.  No one could quite come up with the right combination to satisfy the die-hard fan as well as the casual viewer.I went into the theater looking forward to the experience, and I honestly was not dissapointed.  While there are a few alterations from what you will see on stage or on your CD player as far as the music is concerned, generally it stays true to form.  The staging and cinematics sell this movie, as well as the reputation of the stage show.If you are looking for an exact duplicate of the CD's or the stage, you're not going to get it.  They do take some liberties but they aren't outrageous in doing it.  No one will ever match Michael Crawford playing the role of the phantom, and the first time or two the Phantom was on screen, the voice just didn't do it for me.  At times, Butler seems forced and unnatural, but by the time the movie was 30 minutes in, I wasn't obsessing over it any longer.  Just sit back and enjoy the ride.  Bravo Schumacher, you did well."	4.0	Close enough	2005-01-14	3	0	3
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3RLP7U4RUT6R2	Jerry	"First of all, this movie is nearly perfect. The translation from the stage to the screen was to me, spectacular.  Then disaster strikes.  Sir Andrew, I love almost everything you do.  Mr. Schumacher, YOU BLEW THE ENDING SO BADLY THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER TAKE ON A PROJECT LIKE THIS AGAIN. Take the movie back and re-shoot the ending!  Please!I literally felt sick. The signature part of the entire production was a disaster.  When Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote ""It's over now...the music of the night""...it's over. That's it. End of story.  (Not in this movie!)First of all, the guy playing the Phantom sings the phrase like an American Idol reject.  Listen to the original cast recording and you will hear Michael Crawford sing the line with skill, passion, and heart.  He holds the notes loud, very long, and very strong; leaving you practially breathless. (It is the signature part of the show.)  After he takes his seat, he dissapears, the girl lifts his mask, and the curtain falls.Don't expect that in this movie.  Even after the Phantom blows the last vocal lines, Schumacher felt the need to extend the story about 3 minutes with a TOTALLY USELESS SCENE!Make no mistake, this is an excellent film.  If it were not for the ending, this could have been my favorite movie of all time."	3.0	I LOVED this movie but....	2005-02-09	12	4	8

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3SI0G6FN2BOHT	"Jessica Ke ""Thunderhead"""	"It wasn't bad.  But then again, it didn't meet my expectations.The first time I saw this movie in choir, I wasn't impressed by the musical ability of Emmy Rossum or Jennifer Ellison.  We had ended directly after Angel of Music, and I had headed home, eagerly awaiting more of the movie.  I wasn't able to satiate my hunger for it and immediately pounced on youtube and found the movie in it's entirety and completely fell in love.  From my thoughts then for maybe another year, it was sumptous!  I immediately became obsessed and devoured everything I could ever find.  The cast could do no wrong, the set was beautiful, the voices? Sublime.But then, I went to the stage show for the first time, and was absolutely blown away by that as well.So...I went back home and watched the movie again, and it felt like the shine was gone.  What was left was a visually beautiful film with cold characters, subpar voices and a passionless plot.With all the hype that she had gotten, hailing from the Met and recieving classical training at a young age, Emmy Rossum should have taken one of the greatest soprano roles in musical theatre history and claimed it, becoming Christine Daae physically and vocally.  Rather, I saw a young girl with a mediocre voice who at times, seem to not know just how the heck she got there.  While her voice is light and lifting, the character's voice has been deemed seraphic...angelic...the soprano of the century.  Not by fans, but by the creator himself, Gaston Leroux.  Broadway/West End actresses have possessed these qualities.  Sarah Brightman may have not appealed to many, but there's no doubting her voice was very well refined, her high notes well supported and impressive.  There's no arguement to whether or not she was well qualified in her role.  Subsequent Christines also were lovely, notable names including Sarah Lawrence, Gina Beck, Sierra Boggess...all inspiring.  ERossum just didn't...cut it.  Think of Me was truly emotionless, WYWSHA had many bum notes.  While I applaud her for the magnificent emotion she brought in the later songs, that appreciation is marred by many bum notes and unsupported, breathy phrasing.  There were so many qualified girls vying for the role of Christine, including the magnificent Boggess, now playing the role in Love Never Dies, or even Charlotte Church, who was also on the short list.Gerard Butler....what to say about him...It is difficult praising his acting as stellar because in retrospect, nearly any actor who has played The Phantom has been wonderful.  Gerard Butler certainly brings tears to anybody's eyes in some scenes.  The end, when he screams ""It's over now the music of the night..."" is heart-wrenching, soul shaking...the only problem is...he's screaming.  Reviews are constantly cheering him on for not ever having musical training but...IT'S THE FREAKING PHANTOM OF THE OPERA! HIRE SOMEONE WHO CAN ACTUALLY SING!That is all.In conclusion...the set is marvelous and most of the supporting cast is wonderful.  Yes, Patrick Wilson is a bit wooden, but in All I Ask of You, you can truly hear the love in his voice.  During the Lair scene, the anguish is clear in singing and acting.  Jennifer Ellison is radiant as a more sympathetic Meg than the stage calls for.  Madame Giry...has an interesting accent but makes her mark.  The joint team of Hinds, Callow, and Driver is hilarious and brings some much appreciated comic relief to a dramatic film.  Yet, why must the two leads have been so horribly miscast?  Rossum and Butler were stunning to look at, but Phantom of the Opera shouldn't be watched.  It should be heard, the music should pull at the heartstrings and envelope the mind with it's magic.  All I hear on this soundtrack are two people stuggling to do the best that they can to cater to 80 million eager fans.Though this movie took more than ten years to create, one could wonder, didn't Sir Andrew have any say in the casting of the film?  Could the man who once wrote, and still writes some of the most beautiful music to ever grace the world really choose two unqualified actors in his magnum opus?Phantom of the Opera, I thank you for introducing me to something that is now a large part of my life.  While I do have many negative things to say, in a bind, I'm quite indebted to this movie."	3.0	Waited Half My Life For This...	2010-08-06	2	2	0

All of the original music is there, which you can't say about a lot of movie musicals.  The sets are spectacular and so are the costumes and yet there is an intimacy that isn't there when you view this on the stage. The movie gives some background on how the Phantom came to live in the opera house.The cast is superb.  They couldn't have cast any better Christine than Emmy Rossum, and Gerard Butler as the Phantom has some sex appeal that Michael Crawford lacked.

Folino	"Having seen the stage production in all its glory 3 time, I was convinced that the Motion Picture version could never equal the ""live"" presentation.... I was WRONG... WRONG... WROnG... After viewing the movie version 5 times, I am still mesmerized by the excellence of the production.  Emmy Russum is the true ""Christine"" and fits the role as if she were born for it.  Gerald Butler makes his mark as ""The Phantom"" in the best tradition and his voice and visual reactions gives one, moments that simply do not exist in a stage production.The visual effects created by cinematography, especially the sequence of the transition from ""old theatre to the present"" is so realistic, one can almost ""smell"" the dust in the old theatre as it is transformed.  The pagentry of the ""Masquerade"" number far surpasses the stage version... costumes ... color... lighting... a true masterpiece.Another memorable moment is on the roof of the Opera House... the Phantom is concealed behind a statue as he listens to Raul and Christine sing of thier love ... with ""All I ask of You""....even with all his evil... you can feel the pain in his heart as he watches them embrace.  His vocal response in song after they leave is not only touching... but one of the many highlites of the entire production.If you have any ""heart and mind or soul"" for beautiful music, that for once, has been performed as the composer intended... you will join me in watching this splendid creation over and over again.

He had a firm grasp on the complexity and depth of the role, which in turn, added so many layers to the relationships in the story. Raoul was perfect, and though Christine could have found a few additional facial expressions, I thought she brought a lovely innocence to the role.  Minnie Driver was fabulous as Carlotta!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AWOZ0CZODX9PQ	j	"For a movie that was a long time in the making, the final result was an atrocity that only shows how Hollywood has lost its sparkle.  The magic is gone... and it's a shame that ""Phantom"" was finally made during such a dry-spell.The Phantom of the Opera was the first musical I saw as a child.  I was maybe 11 or 12 years old and it was a turning point.  It made me realize the brilliance of acting, of music, and of the arts as a whole.  I became and actor and a writer and Phantom was always one of my favorite shows... but it should have been left on the stage.Simply put, this movie had a lot of potential... but when you make a movie of a musical, you can't stage it the same way.  Things that work onstage just don't read the same on film... and like other musical bombs such as Moulin Rouge and Chicago which strived to introduce a younger, pop audience to the arts and musical theatre, Hollywood robbed the plays of their artistic integrity.  This movie demands a strong, powerful presence yet the title role was repulsively given to the weakest vocals in the entire cast.  And why...?  Because for some reason, our buddy the Phantom had to be sexy enough to sell the movie like an excrutiatingly long rock video.  Cudos to the actor who played ""Raoul"" -- he completely overshadowed the majestic, painful darkness of the depressed Phantom.  What we're left with is an antagonist who  sings every line with same flat, boring conviction (or lack there of).  The hand gestures are too indicitive and reek of interpretive movement.  There are often moments where you feel the actors in need of something to do, or a place to put their hands because there's simply no direction in the scene.Where Chicago went right was with taking the show to a new medium.  They weren't entirely faithful to the stage structure.  They kept what they could but butchered what didn't work.  Phantom failed to do that, and although I complained that Chicago was a let down after seeing how much was cut and misinterpreted, I think losing some of the symbolism and subplots were worth it in the end... as long as it didn't turn out like Phantom.This isn't a matter of being upset over a lack of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman -- in fact, I'm not a fan of their interpretation either.  Frankly, for those who want a Phantom that overflows with impressive vocal range AND emotion, there is only one voice cast that gives chills and goosebumps.  While a short recording, the Highlights from the Original Canadian Cast on one CD is far superior to any I have ever heard.  Not only do the actors take their songs beyond the written score both lyrically and vocally, their ability to portray Opera singers is far more believable, as their depth and range seem more fleshed out.  Of course, the infamous reunion of Colm Wilkinson and Rebecca Caine (who were previously father and daughter in Les Miserables together) is also a major selling point, but Wilkinson carries the show simply because there's something sinister in his voice.Being the Phantom isn't just about putting on a mask... it's about a painful tortured childhood and a misguided soul who found solace is woman who was just as empty and alone and in need of a passionate release through music.  This movie throws away many powerful lines that would normally jerk tears from its audience and I blame that on some bad casting and too much need to recreate a stage masterpiece on film.  Honestly, when your supporting cast is better than the leads, you know you have a problem."	1.0	...Only because there's no ZERO STARS option	2005-06-14	23	7	16

Hinojos	Having seen Phantom of the Opera on stage several times (first time with Michael Crawford) I was very skeptical and reluctant to see it transformed to film.  So much that I did not find time to view when it was in release.  I have just purchased and viewed this production and now wish I had seen it on the large screen.  Although some of the story line has been altered, the changes included actually are from the original book and better explain the ending of the story.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A12GE27YKZTNYA	JimC	"I have been a huge fan of this musical for close to twenty years.  I used to tell people that I felt sorry for anyone whose first theatre experience was ""Phantom"" because nothing else could ever measure up to its opulence and grandeur, and other great works would suffer by comparison.I had high hopes for the movie, and although I enjoyed it immensely, deep down I felt that the vocal performances of the three leads left just a little to be desired.  Nevertheless, the film was stunning with its lush production values, and as I sat in the theatre, I knew I was just exactly where I wanted to be.It was great to really see the expressions on the faces of the actors, and just that luxury alone made the movie a whole new worthwhile ""Phantom"" experience.I received my DVD today, and looked at the extras first.  They were enormously entertaining, and worth the price of the DVD by themselves.  Then, I started to watch the feature, but, on a whim, turned on the French audio track.  I had never heard ""Phantom"" in French before, but since the setting of the piece is Paris, I thought French might add a flair of authenticity to this wonderful romantic tale.  I was blown away...just who are these French and/or French Canadian actors/singers who did the dubbing for this DVD release???  I wish they were credited.The French musicals ""Notre Dame de Paris,"" ""Romeo et Juliette,"" and ""Autant En Emporte Le Vent,"" along with many others, owe their very existence to Andrew Lloyd Webber and his theatrical visions.  Now, ""Phantom"" may be the greatest French musical of them all..these performances are chilling.It was terrific to once again experience ""Phantom Of The Opera"" in yet a third and even more brilliant light."	5.0	Listen to the French Soundtrack as well..	2005-05-04	6	4	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2XQELSTNMQAKJ	"Jim Whittaker ""Rocky Horror fan"""	The Phantom of the Opera is an opulent, shadowy spectacle that gives the classic story the full Andrew Lloyd Webber rock-opera treatment, implying Webber himself to be the mad songwriting genius behind the mask.  Gerard Butler does a decent job as the Phantom, sounding alternately sensitive and deranged, and Emmy Rossum gives a luminous performance as Christine.  Joel Schumacher's direction is well thought out, and sends the stage action winging from the rafters of the opera house to the depths of the Phantom's underground lair.Although more serious in tone and considerably more expensive, Phantom still begs some comparison to The Rocky Horror Picture Show as a new entry in the rock-horror musical subgenre.  Both films had their start on the London stage, Rocky Horror in 1973 (film released in 1975) and Phantom in 1986 (during a Rocky stage tour in England).  Both are updates of classic literature and film and feature intense leading characters.The connection between the Rocky Horror and Andrew Lloyd Webber camps dates back to 1972, when Webber and lyricist Tim Rice brought director Jim Sharman and set designer Brian Thomson from Australia to stage the London production of Jesus Christ Superstar.  In the cast was a young Londoner named Richard O'Brien, who soon quit over creative differences to write his own rock musical play.  The Rocky Horror Show, directed by Sharman and designed by Thomson, was a smash hit in England and ran for seven years before being revived.  Its influences on stage and screen are still being enjoyed today.	4.0	The newest rock-horror musical!	2005-05-09	2	0	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A34BK0Q4R27OJX	"J. Irwin ""huskernut"""	"As a qualifier, I am an avid musical theatre fan and classically trained singer. Back in the 80s, I couldn't be bothered with seeing Phantom, partly because I was too busy going to show after show of Les Miserables, but mostly because I couldn't picture Michael Crawford as anything other than Cornelius, the wussy shop boy in Hello Dolly.  His voice is nicely trained but his upper register is just simply annoying. I'm sorry to all his fans, but in my musical mind tenor does not equal dark and mysterious and emotionally tortured.  The anger expressed by phans over casting the originals is just silly!  Who wants to watch a 61-year old lusting after an older teenager?  That is not entertainment, that is just gross...anyway, after relentless hounding by my niece, I broke down and took her to NYC to see it.  It was wonderfully entertaining and I was glad to have gone.Ranting over, on with the good stuff.  The movie is an absolutely over-the-top, spectacle in everything (AS IT SHOULD BE, FOLKS!) We're dealing with 19th century, gothic romance and a musical score that is closer to opera than not.Honestly, what else could you expect?The visual aspects of the movie are rich and sensual and draw the viewer into 19th century Paris.  From the opening crack of the auction gavel to the end scenes of phantom disappearing into the emptiness of his life, I found myself ignoring the actors to ""let the spectacle astound"" me.The performances were very good with moments of brilliance for some.  I'll save the best for last, so...MIRANDA RICHARDSON-MADAME GIRY-wonderfully mysterious, has great empathy for phantom, yet realizes he must be stopped. Any cast is improved by her presence.CIARAN HINDS/SIMON CALLOW-MONSIEURS ANDRE/FIRMIN-light comic relief from two veteran actors with good voices.MINNIE DRIVER-LA CARLOTTA-completely campy and completely hilarious.  Eventhough Driver is a trained singer, her singing parts had to be dubbed by a true operatic soprano.  The closing credits song is nicely sung by Driver, though.  SIDENOTE: I have read some reviews that criticized the dubbed voice of the soprano as overblown and baudy-umm, hello?  Carlotta is SUPPOSED to be past her prime and painful to hear-enough already!Now for the big three:PATRICK WILSON-RAOUL-Let's face it, the part itself is not exactly meaty but rather insipid.  Wilson handles it competently and even ups the hero factor.  An accomplished Broadway actor, he has a wonderful lyrical tenor voice, but it does get drowned out at times by the dynamic swells in the orchestrations, a mixing problem, not his.  That hair was awful, though!EMMY ROSSUM-CHRISTINE-In a word, angelic.  Again, the critics drive me insane with reviews stating her young voice was not polished enough.  DUH!!!  She was 17.  The storyline clearly implies that Christine is very good, but to excel she needs to return to her teacher.  Rossum's upper register did sound a bit pinched in a couple of spots, but the quality in general was pure and open especially during the boat ride to phantom's lair as she is essentially vocalizing on an open ""ah"" that ends on E above High C-yikes!Her acting performance was average-it would have been better to see a little more confliction/emotional stress in her facial expressions.  The graveyard number was beautiful and poignant-lovely.  However, the instant costume change from white dressing gown to black irked me.GERARD BUTLER-PHANTOM-In a word, sublime!  As the critics have said-he's no Michael Crawford-THANK THE GOOD LORD!!!  This talented Scot absolutely commands the eye to watch every move he makes.  His phantom is emotionally wrecked, sexy, dark, edgy, tragic, soulful and ultimately heartbreaking.  As others scoff at the frilly costumes and assume the bared chest shots are purely for female viewers, I feel his vulnerability is made even more apparent by those ruffled shirts which seem to lay wide open his aching heart that waits for someone to take care of it.Butler's singing performance is quite good for someone with so little training.  Yes, a couple upper notes seem shouted and/or strained, but I do not think it detracts from the performance, but rather adds a sense of desperation that he no longer has control over Christine and his efforts to do so are futile.  Butler's performance highlight is, without a doubt, Point of No Return; it is simply mesmerizing.Butler's phantom is raw sensuality and emotion.  He could not possibly be more in love with Christine and it is heartbreaking to watch him be denied and ultimately defeated.  If you can watch the last 30 minutes without crying, you have a cold, dead heart!  Butler is so captivating and convincing that it is inconceivable to me how Christine chooses Raoul over phantom.Do yourself a favor, get a bottle of good Italian wine, settle in for a couple of hours of shameless romance and let your fantasies unwind through Gerard Butler's phantom."	5.0	A visual powerhouse and a musical delight for anyone willing to give it a chance!	2006-01-19	174	170	4
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3J9LLWHZH15HG	JJ	To me, Phantom has the most beautiful music ever written for a musical.  Absolutely no comparison.  I've been trying to find the CD with just the music, no lyrics, but no luck so far.  I have heard the original soundtrack and I like this one better.  Sara Brightman has a beautiful voice but it is rather cold to me compared with this.  I think the role of the Phantom is perhaps the most difficult to sing of any broadway musical role.  There is just so much range required.  Gerard Butler does a good job but this is Christine's movie all the way.  I always like to see stage productions on film like this as they can do so much more with it.  I love the gorgeous scenes in the cemetery, etc.  Frankly I could have done with less of Minnie Driver's histrionics but I guess that's the way it's written.  It seemed to make it more comedic than dramatic which is what Phantom is to me.  Real Drama.	5.0	Beautiful movie	2014-03-22	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A365IXIU3B1A9A	J. L. Haninger	"The most important aspect of ""Phantom of the Opera"" is its vocals.  It is, after all, a show about singing, the most sublime singing in its time.  When a production lacks strong vocals, it has missed the point.I don't understand how Andrew Lloyd Webber could give us such a life-changing stage musical and condone the frightful casting in this film.  The roles of the Phantom and Christine--played by Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum, respectively--were most the blatantly miscast.  And these are the most significant characters in the show.Emmy Rossum's voice lacks the maturity and training her role demands.  Even for being seventeen years old, she is unimpressive as a singer--teenage voice students worldwide surpass her without contest.  That said, a teenager has no business singing Christine.  The role requires a level of technique, stamina, mobility, flexibility, consistency, and depth of musicality that only comes with maturity.  Yes, Christine is supposed to be young, and many Phantom movie-lovers listen to past soundtracks or see the stage show, and complain that Christine sounds ""old"" in these, because her voice is operatic.  Let me tell you this: most young singers who have studied for a significant amount of time sing just as operatically.  Why?  Because it's the healthiest way to sing, and has been considered the most pleasant to listen to for centuries, so it's perfectly believable that Christine would have a strong but light operatic voice.Rossum dwarfs Gerard Butler in all their duets.  Butler sounds like the love-child of Satchmo and Kermit the Frog when he sings; my cords hurt just listening to all that throat-grinding.  He grunts his lines with no sensitivity, no phrasing or color...and we're supposed to believe he's the Angel of Music?  I want to hug whoever theorized that Rossum's voice is lacking because she had Butler as her teacher.At least Rossum begins to redeem herself by looking the part.  Butler, however, could pass for a teenager himself.  Christine deserves no one's sympathy in abhorring such a hottie.  That's all the mask hides: a perfect guy with a sexy scar.I'm guessing the underage casting, Rossum's underripe voice, Butler's good looks and ""sexy"" throat-grinding were all part of a design to snag teen and pre-teen viewers.  But what does the film's soundtrack teach them?  Healthy singing is stupid?  Designating the film's ONLY solidly classical/operatic voice to Carlotta--who properly overdoes it--seems to imply traditional, i.e. real opera is for buffoons.I think I shudder in unison with other long-time fans of the musical to realize THIS is now the popular impression of ""Phantom of the Opera.""  I've even had arguments with people who consider the show a ""rock opera.""  Funny...many years ago, I had trouble convincing my friends it wasn't an opera!  I guess this is just a musical's fate: it has to shed some excellence in order to fit on the screen.If you've never seen or heard ""Phantom of the Opera,"" I beg you to see it onstage or listen to an original cast album before cementing the movie in your head.  Between the Original London and Canadian recordings, you'll have a perfect idea of what ""Phantom of the Opera"" was REALLY supposed to be...until ALW decided to betray us.  Long live the original."	2.0	Not the Phantom I fell in love with	2006-12-21	8	4	4

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A23ENAV06K54SB	J. L. Moore	I saw the Phantom of the Opera just this weekend, and I thought that the film was a pretty faithful adaptation to the emotion of the story. I think that what people need to remember while watching is that it is and adaption, and in no way should be compared to the stage play. People who do so will be disappointed. There are no theatrical movements like the stage production (on a 30 foot screen, these movements would appear garish anyway). If you can look at it for what it is...  which is an epic, and very emotional film you'll not be disappointed. The sets are amazing, and the production lavish. I recommend it whole-heartedly.As far as cast goes, I don't think that they could have done better. I love Gerard Butler as the Phantom. He has a huge presence on camera, and a beautiful raw voice. For an actor that remains masked throughout most of the movie, be brings the emotion of the Phantom to life and lets us believe that the character is more than just a monster. Because he's masked, most of his expression is in his eyes, and the emotion conveyed there is amazing and heartrending. Emmy Rossum is amazing as his counterpart with a pristine, and operatic voice. Her preformance  here could really give Sarah Brightman a run for her money. Patrick Wilson was my only real problem with this film. Although he has a beautiful, clear voice he just doesn't carry the same presence as the rest of the characters do. It is in a word, sublime (as the Phantom himself would say I'm sure).	5.0	In a Word, Sublime	2005-06-05	6	4	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3H37ZG32P2571	J. L. Switzer	I wasn't going to watch this movie. Ever since the first time I heard the original cast recording when I was in the eighth grade (I'm not telling you how long ago that was) I have been an absolute fan of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman. I have saw the musical in London and thought it was okay. But my experience with movies based on anything else be it book, older movie or musical was that the new movie version carved the meat and color out of the story and served you the bland shell.So I wasn't going to watch this movie. I studiously avoided it in the theatre.Then a friend insisted I watch it with her and after the ending I was ready to kick myself for not catching this in the theatre. Yes it's different, yes it's not the original cast. But the story is there and even parts of the back story you don't get in the original musical manage to get in.I was pleasantly surprised with the range of emotions the cast was able to convey. While very different from the originals, this movie version of one of my favorite mucisals is perfectly able to stand alone and hold it's head up as a continuation of what I believe to be a great legacy.Agree with me or not I don't care and it doesn't matter. Opinions will always vary.	4.0	Unwillingly pleased	2005-05-23	5	4	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2HVC1IXR56PPS	J. McCormick	"*** THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ***When I first went to see this movie, I wasn't sure whether to expect something great or something mediocre. I had been a little less than impressed with the preview material that had been released. I am happy to say that the film was a near-perfect translation of the musical to the screen.""Near-perfect"", yes. The film version of Phantom is not without its flaws. Certain lines were converted to dialog, presumably to make them seem more natural or something, but in fact they work better when sung. Gerard Butler has a good physical presence as the Phantom, but he clearly doesn't have the voice. Strangely enough, this doesn't detract from the movie as much as one might expect. Some of the musical cuts actually hurt the pacing of the movie, particularly near the end of the movie after ""Point of No Return"", where an additional 30 seconds or so of music was added that slowed (although did not stop) the momentum of that scene. And I think the counterpoint in ""Wandering Child"" - cut for the movie and some stage productions - adds a lot to that song.But these are all very minor complaints, as the overall quality of the movie translation overshadows them all. They are at worst minor annoyances. In many ways, the movie version is *better* than the stage version, in that a greater intimacy is possible on film than on stage, and here that works to great effect. For example, it would be difficult to show Raoul with slight tears in his eyes on stage, and yet in this film we get these more subtle effects, which serve to make Raoul a *much* more interesting character than he is on stage. I couldn't say whether a ""perfect"" stage production is better or worse than the movie, because the performance of this musical that I saw on stage had a mediocre cast and mediocre staging.There are things that happened in the movie that didn't happen in the stage version I saw, and they really made things more effective: the Phantom catching Christine when she faints, the highly sensual nature of ""Point of No Return"", Christine closing the Phantom's hand around the ring when she hands it back to him (in the stage version I saw, she held it out to him at arm's length).I thought many of the cuts in the story actually strengthened it rather than weakened it. While the stage version works well with the Don Juan rehearsal intact, I think that would have made the movie a bit boring, and in fact the move of the Phantom's jabs at everyone from a note (as on stage) to an in-person delivery (as in the movie) makes the Phantom seem a bit more bold yet aloof, which works very well, I think.All in all, this movie comes down to whether it captured the essence of the Phantom musical and whether it was moving. And on both counts I would say that yes, it did and it was. To me, even more so than the stage production I saw.The special features are worth it if you're a Phantom fan, so I would recommend the 2-disc version above the single-disc version."	5.0	Excellent	2006-02-14	3	3	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1UUVI8DMQQDPT	Joanna Duarte	"What is all this chatter about the 'original' Phantom?  Andrew Lloyd Webber explained his choice of Gerard Butler as the Phantom: he said he wanted a 'rock star' persona, and Michael Crawford, no matter what age, would not have fulfilled that requirement; Gerard Butler did.  I have seen the stage play, and the movie several times, and I own both the London stage and movie soundtracks, and one thing that stands out is the emotion in Mr. Butler's version, which does not come across to me in Mr. Crawford's version.  When Gerard's Phantom is sad, you know it -- when he's angry, you REALLY know it!  I also believe Emmy Rossum is about as perfect a Christine as there could be . . . how lucky was that?  She's divine!  And how about Minnie Driver?  What a hoot!  I love her ""these things do happen"" routine, who cares if she doesn't sing?  What professional opera singer could they have found who could have played the role 1/2 as well?Anyhow, forget 'the original' for now.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A35VT7X6VTY6FC	"J. OConnor ""D.

The music haunted me, and my nearly action-movie-only husband, afterward.  So we bought the DVD and tried again with subtitles ON.  I fell so wholeheartedly in love with this beautiful musical that I have watched it repeatedly.  I turn it on here and there just to get a music fix.I think all the actor/singers did a marvelous job.  I particularly like Patrick Wilson as Raoul.  He has prince charming appeal with a rich, warm voice.  Emmy Rossum is perfect.  Gerard Butler is sympathetic, yet frightening.The whole show is an extremely over-the-top melodrama, and I love it without any reservation.  I believe it will be among the most loved and watched movies in my collection for all time.	5.0	Haunted by the Phantom!	2005-05-22	2	1	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	"A film by Joel SchumacherThis movie is an adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's long running Broadway musical ""The Phantom of the Opera"".  I imagine that most people have at least heard of the musical and that it has something to do with a phantom, and an opera, and that there is singing.  To be perfectly honest, that is the extent of my knowledge and experience of the stage musical.  Because of this lack of experience with the stage version, I had no preconceived notions of what ""Phantom"" should look like, or sound like, but only that it is supposed to be good and it has been wildly successful.  Andrew Lloyd Webber himself was involved in the casting of this project, especially in regards to Emmy Rossum as Christine.""The Phantom of the Opera"" begins with an auction in an old opera house where there is a chandelier which the auctioneer tells us featured prominently in the famous fracas with a ""phantom of the opera"" and that perhaps time will finally exorcise the phantom.  When the enormous chandelier is revealed we are greeted with a powerful blast of music as the dust and cobwebs and decay of the opera house are blown back and we see the opera house return to its former glory of years past.  The movie now takes us back to the time where the Phantom did, in fact, haunt the opera house.  When the resident diva of the opera, Carlotta (Minne Driver) is nearly hurt in an accident, a young girl from the chorus, Christine (Emmy Rossum) takes the lead with little time to rehearse or prepare.  She is a success and the new talk of the opera world and Raoul (Patrick Wilson), the patron of the new owners of the opera house is smitten with her.  It also seems that Christine and Raoul knew each other as children.Something strange happens next.  Christine is reluctant to dine with Raoul because her mysterious teacher wouldn't be happy, but we don't know who the teacher is (though we can guess).  When Raoul leaves her dressing room, the door locks, the candles blow out and we hear a voice sing out to Christine.  It is her teacher.  It is the Phantom (Gerard Butler).  Christine finally meets the Phantom, her teacher, and they spend some time together as he admonishes her about being faithful to him and his music and sings about ""the music of the night"".  Except for Christine, everybody else wants to be rid of the Phantom and thus begins the heart of the movie where Raoul and the Phantom both want Christine, Christine is initially unsure of her desires, and the Phantom continues to haunt and attack the opera if things do not go exactly the way he demands (and they don't).It seems unfair to criticize a movie based on a Broadway musical/rock opera of being ""too theatrical"".  Considering the origins of this movie, it only makes sense for it to be ""theatrical"".  Still, Gerard Butler flaps his cape at the camera more than one too many times.  It is as if he were trying out for the role of Count Dracula in some campy remake where he isn't supposed to be serious.  Except that he is supposed to be serious.  Which brings me to my next point: Butler as The Phantom isn't terribly menacing.  He is too pretty.  His mask seems more of a fashion accessory than something that is just covering up being disfigured.  Only when he is in the shadows and attacking people in secrecy do we truly get menace from Butler.  It is the unseen that brings the most tension to the character.  Butler has a nice voice and on some songs he sounds impressive, but much of his work here is absolutely ordinary.  Patrick Wilson, on the other hand, is no better.  He doesn't seem the sort of man who would impress Christine and there is no scene, no chemistry that shows us why they are interested in each other except that they knew each other as children.  The looming face off between Raoul and the Phantom just doesn't work for me.  The movie seemed long, a bit dull, and repetitive.There is much to praise in this movie, however.  The first thing that must be pointed out is that this is a beautiful looking movie.  It looks incredible.  The sets are fantastic, the costume design, the use of colors, all of it is just perfect.  Every scene change brings another fantastic image to the screen.  This is a gorgeous movie to look at.  The second praiseworthy part of this film is Emmy Rossum as Christine.  I don't know what Christine is supposed to look like or act like on stage, but here she radiates such an innocence that it is easy to see why the Phantom wants Christine for himself and why Raoul would be physically attracted to her.  Christine is pure.  Rossum can also sing quite well.  Her voice is what carries the movie as far as it can be carried.  The final bit of praise goes to the rest of the cast (excluding Butler and Wilson).  They are all excellent, including Minnie Driver as the diva Carlotta.  Perfectly overplayed (which is an odd thing for me to say considering my problems with Butler).""The Phantom of the Opera"" has quite a few things going for it, and I am quite sure that fans of the stage musical will be equally happy with this movie.  I wasn't quite so happy.  I am giving ""Phantom"" a very generous B- for the performance of Emmy Rossum and the look of the movie.-Joe Sherry"	3.0	something of a bore, but Rossum was fantastic	2004-12-29	9	1	8

And going from the black and white auction to the heydey of the Paris Opera during the Overture even exceeds the same effect from the stage production.But now the performances.Rossum has a splendid innocent voice.  Truly beautiful.  Her facial range of emotion, however, tends more toward the wonder and less toward, well, anything else.  She will probably one day be a talent to be reckoned with in musical theatre, but she still has some way to go.Butler.  How can I say it...?  The Phantom, let's face it, is not a role for a true Baritone, as is exhibited when Butler attempts to hit the high Ab's in ""Music of the Night"".  He also has the infuriating habit of sliding into notes (which is acceptable in more popular singing) and sliding down after each phrase of music, even if it is not yet the complete sentence (this, however, is unforgivable in any singing style).  And if this did not ruin his performance for me (actually, this did more than ruin his performance for me), he seemed to be having trouble staying in key (which is an easy thing to do with Lloyd Webber's simple music).One thing which I was happy about was that Schumacher brought out the character of Raoul more.  Granted, the man is still pretty much a wimp, and I don't agree with some of Schumacher's direction here, but at least he was more, say, present.The highlight of the performances was watching the Theatre Owners.  Here are two perfect comic actors whom I felt could almost make up for Butler's bad singing.  They were excellent, but not good enough for that.  Of course, nobody could be that good.This is altogether an average production overall, which I would recommend to anyone to see once.  If your musical senses are so calm that you can take Butler, then I'll recommend it for twice."	3.0	Just like any ALW, the stars are the sets.	2005-03-03	6	1	5

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ACTG0NWGJMNSM	"John Larsen ""Johncritic"""	As a theatrical production, Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera incorporates the audience into the action, forcing them to become witting accomplices to the romance and mayhem that surrounds them. When the Phantom emerges from the dark, wet catacombs of the opera house to haunt the current production, the theater audience, by design, also become his victims, and when that grand, glorious chandelier comes crashing down, they take it personally.Except for the catalog of popular songs, which blast from the speakers in deafening Dolby, Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera has very little personality. Experiencing the pomp and pageantry is one thing, sitting back and watching it is another. It doesn't take long before you wish a chandelier would crash through the screen. You know a movie is in trouble when you're rooting for the lighting.Filled with larger-than-life movie moments, what this Phantom lacks is a heart and soul. Those traits are built into the story and songs, but director Joel Schumacher and his cast leave little to be desired. What was once vibrant and stunning has become jarring and garish. As in the case of such great Hollywood musicals as Singing in the Rain and West Side Story, Phantom would have benefitted with the presence of two directors.That would have allowed this Phantom to have his torte and eat it too. A dramatic director would have been able to bring some level of reason to the romance, helping counterbalance Schumacher's glitter and sequin production design. Phantom is pretty to look at, but that's part of the problem. It's too pretty. There's no nuance or menace in the lighting, robbing this Phantom of any expectation. When the Phantom is lit better than Barbra Streisand, he becomes picture postcard pretty.That's because he's played by young Gerard Butler, whose jet black hair, chiseled jaw and porcelain doll complexion paint him more as a rock star doing a charity concert than someone who has been scarred and abandoned by society. Up until now, the Phantom has been depicted as something of a monster, a musical genius forced to hide from life and love. One look at Butler's Phantom and you wonder what all the fuss is about.It's hard to lurk around in the shadows when the dark corners of the opera house are better lit than most public restrooms.Indeed, the production design is grand and glorious, every chamber, every street, every rooftop and catacomb a wonder to behold. Designer Anthony Pratt gives Schumacher his money's worth, but at what cost? Schumacher shortchanges the actors by forcing them to compete with the scenery, inflating every emotion to match the wallpaper. His cast is serviceable but not spectacular, something this Phantom deserves. Emmy Rossum is pretty and delicate as Christine Daae, plucked from the chorus line by the Phantom to star in his new opera. When the Phantom speaks, people listen, and when they don't, people die.So when the man behind the mask falls for Christine, he sets off a romantic tug-of-war with her suitor, Raoul (Patrick Wilson), who vows to keep Christine safe from the music of the night. Webber and Schumacher have refashioned Gaston Leroux's 1911 novel into an amusement park ride that just keeps spinning its wheels. It doesn't take long before the ride becomes tiresome.	3.0	PHANTOM OF THE OPERA OFF-KEY	2005-06-01	12	7	5

I love this movie and could watch it over and over.  In fact I have!  I think the singing is amazing and was quite pleasantly surprized by Butler's vocal range despite his not having any formal training.  I have had friends that have criticized his singing compared to the other lead characters.  I on the other hand felt that, intentional or not, it was very appropriate that the Phantom's singing did not match the other's as his character was not an opera member but a mentor of Christine.  As the saying goes, ""those that can't, teach"".  Minnie Driver's prima donna character lends a wonderful sense of fun to the movie.  Don't miss her solo song at the end of the movie. I had the privilege to be able to see The Phantom performed in Las Vegas last year and felt that the singing on the DVD was far superior.  If you like opera, amazing set design or are a fan of Gerard Butler I would highly reccommend this movie."	5.0	The Phantom Takes the Spotlight	2010-12-07	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A262XEAR1I3E7Z	John Schneiderwind	"I like the Phantom of the Opera, I really do.  The key word here is ""Opera"" which the director fails miserably in capturing by casting Gerard Butler.  He may be a good actor and acted out the part of the Phantom well, I must say, but the Phantom is supposed to have a soaring, operatic, wonderful voice.  Butler, sadly, just is not a good singer.  Before you jump down my throat about being a purist, I'm NOT a Michael Crawford fan.  I don't think he can sing either.  Why didn't they cast a real operatic talent for the film?  Australian star Anthony Warlow, for example, would have been an ideal choice with his classical operatic training and experience as the youngest Phantom ever.  I'd even take Colm Wilkinson over Butler.Butler's inability to sing aside, the sets were marvelous and the rest of the cast was superb, especially Christine and Raoul.  I'm glad they cast Raoul with a good singer and not a squeaky weakling like so often done on the stage.  Carlotta was hilariously perfect and Piangi was, well, Piangi.For those who want to see a beautiful cinematic portrayal of the musical, this is the movie for you.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A33CLVW2K7SL1P	Jonathan Appleseed	"I didn't see the musical, nor am I familiar with the music, so I am perhaps a perfect candidate (regardless of whether or not I write this well and it makes any sense &lt;grin>) to review this purely as a film.And as a film, I loved it.Certainly, I had a problem with the monster (Phantom) who desires heaven but lives in ""Hades"", being so handsome. Take the mask off, and really, he's still not entirely loathsome - so when he was singing to Christine about his hideousness, I kept expecting her to chime in with, ""Really, have you looked in the mirror? You're not so bad!"" I understand that the initial story had the Phantom as a more horrifying, deformed creature. I saw a picture - and yes, the Phantom was far from pretty. But the musical was written around a loathsome Phantom and the Phantom simply isn't loathsome, unless you count what's inside of him - that he's possessive and murderous. That, most certainly, is loathsome. I leaned over to my friend and commented once that the Phantom doesn't seem to understand that the gift is in the giving.I'm referring, of course, to his indignant anger at having taught Christine all she knows about music, setting the stage - quite literally - for her to become the star of the show, writing shows for her, and then when she runs into her childhood love she ""forsakes"" him, although certainly there was nothing to forsake.Roger Ebert said, ""In this version, any red-blooded woman would choose the Phantom over Raoul, even knowing what she knows now"". I'm not sure what movie he was watching. He's specifically comparing the physical attractiveness of the Phantom and Raoul. Well, not every red-blooded woman would choose the Phantom over Raoul. I know plenty who think that Paul Wilson, who played Raoul, is ""fine"". Then again, Roger Ebert may not be the best person to judge another man's looks.Ebert also said that the music is bland, repetitive, and not likely to have people humming the tunes as they left the theater. I left humming several tunes, and it took a while for me to get them out of my head. That said, I do agree that the music is repetitive in some places. But how ingenious can such a prolific writer of music be expected to be? Writers of books have certain techniques that they employ, they write a certain way - even when they're using different techniques they have invented to shake up their writing. You can still tell it's the same writer, for the most part. So I don't expect every single song from Andrew Lloyd Webber to be a perfectly original masterpiece.The movie itself looked magnificent. All of the sets, from the stage, to the cemetery, and especially the dungeons of the Phantom were spectacular, an absolute visual delight. The performance of Masquerade was truly a thing of beauty, with warm golden tones emanating like balls of sunshine from every inch of the frame, with the magnificent colors of a New England autumn folded over the gilded beauty to force your eyes to the screen.It's a pity that it's not doing very well at the box office. It was made for about $60 million, and so far it's only made $21.5, and in Europe about $10. It deserves much better - and I hope it gets it."	5.0	Beautiful Phantom	2005-01-09	6	5	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2DSXA1E02C86D	Joseph Haschka	"Several years ago, I saw the stage production of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA at Her Majesty's Theatre in London. I only remember that the wooden seats were uncomfortably hard, and that I came away thinking ""chick story"". The cinema seat for this Big Screen version was much friendlier to my couch potato tushy, but it's still a ""chick flick"" in the same way that FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS was a ""guy flick"". Of course, I dragged my wife to the latter.The convenient thing about musicals is that the plots are usually simple, often simplistic. OK, so here we have this guy with a facial deformity, The Phantom (Gerard Butler), who, as a child, escaped from a freak show and took refuge in a palatial Parisian opera house; he's managed to live there his entire life. His living space is in the structure's bowels, replete with guttering candles, slimy hanging stuff, and lots of murky, green water. Nevertheless, he manages an elegant wardrobe, topped off by an anachronistically cheesy mask that covers the half of his face that needs plastic surgery. Psychologically, he has issues. In any case, he's somewhat of a musical genius that composes operas for house presentation. He becomes enthralled with a pretty, young actress, Christine (Emy Rossum), who's managed, on the strength of an absolutely fab singing voice, to supplant the resident diva, Carlotta (Minnie Driver). The Phantom competes for Christine's affections with the establishment's patron, Vicompte Raoul (Patrick Wilson).Emy Rossum is radiant as Christine, but unconvincing in her romantic attentions to either Raoul or The Phantom, perhaps because she ricochets back and forth between the two for most of the movie. I'd have dumped her for somebody more committed. Minnie Driver is wonderful as the annoying and conceited Carlotta, but then I find all of Driver's film personae annoying; it was inspired casting. Butler was a poor choice for The Phantom; he seemed an inadequate clone of, say, a young Antonio Banderas. Raoul might just as well have been a cardboard cut-out. And at well over two hours, the run time of the film approaches mind-numbing.But, I'm still awarding FOUR stars and recommending a look-see because the costuming and sets are eye-popping. Why, the candle expense alone would bankrupt a small country. The fact that THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA wasn't nominated for an Oscar for Best Achievement in Costuming is appalling; they wuz robbed. And the music, of course, inspires swooning - especially if you're a chick."	4.0	Nothing psychotherapy and plastic surgery can't fix	2005-02-02	7	3	4

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3UFLDM3M3D7TE	Josh Adams, &#34;Rock Crushes Paper&#34;	Read reviews from ALL sources before buying this. Had I known that purchasing this was going to commit me into watching 2 and a half hours of monotony, barely passable acting, and subpar singing by Gerald Butler I would have paid the same amount to have that time back.I appreciate the efforts given, but some of the choices in casting are subject to question. The stock After Effects film grain given to the more recent timeline in the movie and the clarity brought in when moving back in time simply doesn't make logical sense. I love theater productions, but this film adaptation feels B-movie in every regard.It was not an enjoyable experience to watch, sometimes painful to listen to. The makeup on the Phantom is laughable, as is most of the production. By the end of the film you just don't care about the lead characters, their indecisions, their motives. Drab, boring, dull.

Ourada ""trackdistancerunner"""	NOTE: I HAVE SEEN THE FILM!I have also seen the show performed on stage twice which is where I originally fell in love with it.  I agree that Sarah and Michael are better singers, but honestly that was to be expected.  If people are going to have the mindset they are better and no one can surpass them then I suggest don't even see the movie if you can't give the new cast a chance.  On their own this cast is wonderful.  No Gerald and Emmy arn't the most wonderful singers, but they put so much passion into every word they sing, it's amazing.  The really acted the parts as they sung, which made the viewer feel for both of them deeply, which in a way was sometimes missing from the Broadway show.  Nothing can ever take away the moment when I first saw Phantom on stage, but this film is worth seeing and I would see it again in a moment.	5.0	Worthy Effort	2004-12-26	5	5	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1RBE8GZPV7YIB	Joyanne M. Bell	"Andrew Lloyd Webber is a fine composer, and frankly one of my favorite repeat viewing experiences is Evita.  The Phantom of the Opera is a quality production, but I simply couldn't finish it.  The story line is not complex, but the length of time taken to crawl through it, together with what does not to me comprise very lively and interesting music for the most part (what is largely ""connecting"" music, where words are sung in barely melodic snatches merely because the medium is operatic), caused me ultimately to turn it off, satisfied that I had understood the idea well enough and somewhat frantic to end the tedium.  Some of the story line and acting insulted the intelligence, with conflicts being prolonged unrealistically and unnecessarily, and that element didn't help, either.  Anyway, this work turned out to be a large disappointment for me, all the more considering the fine body of works that have come from this man's creative pen."	2.0	Nice production, but too long and slow	2012-09-26	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2CZBGIJP8TZ1T	Joy	"I have seen many versions of The Phantom Of The Opera. I've seen the 1925 version with Lon Chaney, the one with Claude Rains, the 80's version with Robert Englund and the 1990 one with Charles Dance which is actually my all time favorite movie along with this 2004 Phantom film. I also own the Original Cast Recording CD and the Original Motion Picture soundtrack to this film. When I first heard about this movie coming out in December, I knew I would like it but I really didn't think I would totally fall in love with it like I have. I saw the film in the theatre over 30 times because I love it so much and it is so romantic and artistic that it was like they made the film just for me. Since I am this total hopeless romantic, this film is MY FILM!! I bought the 2 disc DVD the day it came out and have already watched everything and have seen some parts more than once. It takes a lot to impress me when it comes to movies because I don't need nudity and cursing or just a bunch of people getting drunk and stuff like that.What really impresses me about this film is the whole artistic and romantic setting. Like all the candlebras and roses and everything is covered in gold and even the stage curtain looks like real velvet. They use real animals in the shows and in The Phantom Of The Opera, there is a real horse. The actual theatre is covered with red velvet, gold and statues and the chandelier looks like it's made out of real diamonds and gold. And all the romantic things that both The Phantom/Gerard Butler and Raoul/Patrick Wilson do are just so breathtaking and powerful. Like when the Phantom is singing to her in The Music Of The Night, I can see so much passion between the two and he just takes and holds her hand and after she faints, he carries her to the bed and he doesn't even try to do anything sexual with her. He pulls down that curtain around the bed. I just totally love that. And Raoul sings his heart out to Christine up on the rooftop in All I Ask Of You about how much he loves her, he doesn't try to have sex with her. They share this very romantic, passionate kiss and every time I see the All I Ask Of You scene, I start to cry because it's so romantic and wish that could happen to me!  I wish I could find a man as romantic as they two are. The Phantom Of The Opera scene is so powerful that it totally takes my breath away!!  I love how they filmed Christine and The Phantom going down the stairs as Christine sings ""The Phantom Of The Opera Is There, Inside My Mind.""  I also love the Masquerade ball, it's amazing musically, vocally, visually. I love how Christine and Raoul dance and then share this kiss!  My all time favorite scenes are The Phantom Of The Opera, The Music Of The Night, All I Ask Of You, Masquerade and The Overture. I watch those over and over again.All the other cast members are amazing also. Minnie Driver plays a really funny Carlotta, and Andre/Simon Callow and Firmin/Ciaran Hinds are funny whenever they talk about scrap metal. I always laugh when they say scrap metal.As far as the music and singing goes, it's so incredible and musically, it's better than the Original Cast Recording because they had over a 100 piece orchestra which sounds so much better and fuller. The singing is definitely one big reason I also love this film. Emmy Rossum/Christine has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard and to be honest there are a lot of parts where Emmy does a better job than Sarah Brightman did. On The Point Of No Return/Don Juan, when Emmy sings ""When will the flames at last consume us"" she hits this really low register and it sounds so amazing and incredible. I also love it when Emmy sings really high in the very first part of the Don Juan opera. She also hits this really high note and holds it in that part right before All I Ask Of You starts. Emmy also shows her emotions through her singing unlike Sarah Brightman. At the very end when Christine is singing to the Phantom, ""The tears I might have shed for your dark fate, grow cold, and turn to tears of hate"" you can hear the hatred in Emmy's voice. Gerard Butler who plays The Phantom might not be as good as Michael Crawford but there are a few parts that I feel Gerard has done a better job.  Especially after Christine kisses him at the end, you can hear him crying and feel his heartache. They are all incredible but I listen to the Phantom soundtrack a lot just to hear Emmy's voice. This film is now my favorite along with the Charles Dance version.The special features on the 2nd disc were really cool because I found out so much information. The Behind the mask: The story of The Phantom Of The Opera actually shows footage from inside the real Paris Opera House and there really is an underground lake and saw some creature swimming around which looks really cool. They also show a lot of shots from the Broadway musical with Sarah Brightman. It shows Sarah singing in a church. I was amazed that they put in some info about past versions of the film and showed a picture from the 1990 version with Charles Dance who is my favorite actor of all time. The Making Of The Phantom Of The Opera is in 3 parts, Preproduction, The Director, and Production. In these 3 parts, you will see interviews with Andrew Lloyd Webber, Joel Schumacher, Emmy Rossum, Gerard Butler, Patrick Wilson, Minnie Driver, Miranda Richardson, Simon Callow, Kevin R McNally who plays Buquet, Jennifer Ellison who plays Meg, and many others including the lyricist Charles Hart. And these bonus features are over an hour each.The third feature, which I've seen a lot of reviews stating that it's The Phantom singing Learn To Be Lonely, it's NOT Learn To Be Lonely, it's No One Would Listen! It's the same melody but the lyrics are totally different! No One Would Listen is sung by the Phantom and is an additional scene not shown in the film and it's a very short scene and they should have included it in the film. There is also an Easter Egg that's a Sing A Long to The Phantom Of The Opera and shows Emmy twice and a lot of other Cast and Crew members singing and it's very funny!!! The last thing is a DVD-ROM PC Weblink extra also if you have a PC that will play it but unfortunately, my computer doesn't have a DVD-ROM but that's not a big deal because eventually I will get a PC with a DVD-ROM. I highly recommend this to all Phantom fans and romantics!!! You will not be disappointed!!!"	5.0	One of the most romantic films I've ever seen!!!!!	2005-05-14	11	8	3

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1LVZOK9F7K4CN	JR Pinto	"I have just seen Andrew Lloyd Weber's The Phantom of the Opera last night and I still don't quite know how to feel about it.  This is my favorite Broadway musical of all time.  I have been privileged enough to see it twice on stage with the inimitable Michael Crawford.  This Phantom is significantly different - both the production and the character.  On stage, the Phantom is an older man who is missing most of his face.  In this film, the Phantom is so young and so sexy we wonder why Christine would ever be interested in Raoul.  The movie has more time and ability to go into the Phantom's backstory - the problem is the backstory makes no sense!  In the book, it was explained that Erik was the son of a master mason who grew up to be one of the contractors who worked on the opera house.  In the movie, he is a child who is rescued from a freak show by Madame Giry who has grown up in the opera house.  (Perhaps that gave him time to install a pipe-organ single-handedly.)  Joel Schumacher has tried to ""humanize"" the Phantom, which is the wrong decision because - like Hamlet - the Phantom is a larger-than-life character.  The worst filmmaking decision is to have the Phantom swordfight Raoul...and lose!  The Phantom is like Hannibal Lecter - he would NEVER let anybody get the upper hand on him.  In the play, the Phantom spends most of the time off-stage, creating an air of mystery.  Also, in the play, he has more of a devilish sense of humor.  The movie phantom does not move in the same way the stage phantom does - gone are the balletic gestures that accompany The Music of the Night.In the hands of a better filmmaker, this would have been a better movie.  Shumacher is a little uncomfortable about having the characters sing directly into the camera.  He cares more about the story than the music and seems to be happiest when he is adding extra scenes.  He also misses opportunities to do things with film - superimpositions and the like - that cannot be done on stage.  Emmy Rossum is great as Christine.  Patrick Wilson is a fine singer to play Raoul - a character I have never liked.  Gerard Butler has the thankless job of being ""the guy who isn't Michael Crawford.""However, there is much that the movie does get right.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, it keeps the score intact.  There are a few minor changes - some lines are spoken rather than sung, which is REALLY annoying.  The movie LOOKS beautiful.  The set pieces translate wonderfully to the film.  When we hear the overture, there is an electric moment - literally - when the chandelier comes to life and the old opera house rejuvenates.  The transition in the song Think of Me occurs perfectly.  The journey through the mirror and into the labyrinth is fantastic.  Much of the special effects from the stage show are preserved.  Even a few new additions are here from the book: the horse and the torture chamber!Do I recommend the movie?  Wholeheartedly.  Is the film a satisfying interpretation of the stage play?  No - it is just too different.  Characters and relationships are altered for the worse.  Watching the movie, I became grateful that the play is still running strong all over the world and shows no signs of stopping.  I can't wait to see it on stage again - where it belongs.  This film - taken on its own merits - is still great.  Even though I will see the movie again many times in my life, it cannot compare to the stage version.  The theater occupies a world too surreal to ever be adequately captured on film."	5.0	I HAVE SEEN IT!!!	2004-10-24	561	475	86

Some of the music is watered down and the actors leave much to be desired (in singing and acting).If you want a good audio recording of this I recommend  the ""The Phantom of the Opera (Original 1986 London Cast)"" CD.  It leaves out some story but still leaves you satisfied.  Also the singers are much better than in the movie.  However, if you can't sit still for about an hour and just listen to a CD of this great performance, I guess you'll just have to settle for the poorer performance given in the movie."	2.0	Nothing compared to the Broadway production.	2007-01-08	2	0	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A19MFW3WNIMQTJ	J.Stevens	"Director Joel Schumacher and producer Andrew Lloyd Webber are truly angels of music. This film boasts not only a wonderful re-orchestrated soundtrack with a new song and some new music, but a very talented ensamble of performers. While devoted fans maybe disappointed by the re-casting of Christine and the Phantom (originally played by Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford) Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler have a chemistry that captivate the viewer.  Emmy Rossum brings a touch of innocense and naiveness to Christine, while Gerard Butler's rock n roll edged voice gives the phantom his ""power"" to ""control"".The love triangle between Christine, Raoul and the Phantom is the mesmorizing main storyline; however, the smaller storyline of the new owners of the opera populaire proves to be a humorous sideline.  With the climax making some viewers wonder what will just happen next, some viewers may want to keep the tissues nearby for the ending."	5.0	Brava! Brava! Bravisima!	2006-07-13	1	1	0

I myself being an actor for musicals, thought that it would have been much better if one,they had had Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman playing the role of Phantom and Christine, and two, if they sang the songs like Andrew Lloyd Webber intended them to with not as many words and more singing. I also think they should have used more of the words that Andrew Lloyd Webber wrot it with instead of changing som of them. For example, when Chrinstine was singing ""Think of Me"", Rauol said, during his line, ""Long ago, it seemed so long ago, how young and inocent we were"" instead of ""What a change, you're really not a bit, that gawkish girl that once you were"". I relize that they did that so it wouldn't be so harsh but I feel they could have kept it in along with some other changes. Now even though I have said some not as good things about this movie, I still am a BIG Phantom of the Opera and Andrew Lloyd Webber fan and I think that this movie is still very good and I recomend that you see it.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1L677OAQKVZ70	J. Thompson	I fell in love with the music of &quot;Phantom&quot; when i bought my 1st Sarah  Brightman cassete many years ago. I have waited these many years for the play to make it to film and at long last it has.There will be many who grumple that &quot;Webber&quot; deliberatly delayed the making of this film to deny &quot;Brightman&quot; her film immortality in a movie adaptation of the greatest play and greatest music she has had or ever will have in her astonishing career. Maybe there is truth somewhere here a lingering bitterness of their failed marriage or what ever.  I too would have liked to have seen the original Broadway cast reprise their roles on the big screen, but for whatever reason that window was closed forever.However, that being said it in no way lessens the visual &amp; audio impact of this new movie. Gerald Butler captures the essence of the troubled and lonely Phantom and his vocals of &quot;music of the Night&quot; and indeed throught out the movie leave nothing to be desired. Emmy Rossum is young , fresh and the perfect Christine. Her voice is true and crisp and she need never feel she failed to raise to the challange left her by Brightman, she met that challange head on and matched it beautifully. Her rendition of &quot;wishing you were here&quot; performed in the grey mist of a cemetary will reach down deep in anyone who loves good music well performed. Her duet with Patrick Wilson &quot;say you'll love me&quot; well it just dosen't get any better then that.If you don't have your copy BUY IT you will never regret the purchase price. However, one cavet of advice buy it it &quot;wide screen&quot; NOT full screen for the sheer grandeur of the visual aspects of the film.	5.0	Better late then never	2005-05-05	4	2	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ANEJZQQ3LC1D3	J. Tincher	I've seen the Broadway show several times and have owned the original CD for since 1989, I am very familiar with the music and the stunning performances by Michael Crawford. It was a major blunder on Llyod Weber's part to not enlist Michael Crawford as the Phantom.The movie (and the play) is about the Phantom. It is there that the performances should be the strongest, the richest and the most powerful of voice. Sadly this new phantom has none of these traits... your average rock singer (limited talent) could have sung this role better.I have no malice towards Gerard Butler, I'm sure he is a fine actor. But he should never have been cast for this role. Instead of The Phantom standing out it's more of a backdrop. Even it they couldn't cast Michael they should have considered someone who has taken voice or who could sing. Perhaps Butler should have remained a lawyer.	2.0	Greatly Disappointed	2005-02-01	13	3	10

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3M6RVUVZOQZLB	"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector"""	I first saw Phantom of the Opera with an unbiased view: I knew nothing about it except the names of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman. I was mesmerized! I was emotionalized! I was hooked! Perfect acting, perfect casting, perfect music, perfect productions. OK, it would have been better if Minnie Driver had sung with her own voice--that's my only complaint, and a minor one at that.I have watched the film over and over and am equally moved each time with this desperately sad story of unrequited love, but then again this ending of this version has possibilities.Anything I say about Gerard Butler will be redundant, I am sure, or of  Emmy Rossum or Patrick Wilson, so I will focus on the music. I have listened to the soundtrack over and over and have formulated the opinion that Andrew Lloyd Webber's music has parallels with Beethoven's music. It is as rich in the romantic tradition of high and low notes, much musicality, repetition of same and similar musical phrases and songs, each version engendered with a new slant. Has a musically trained person noticed the parallels? I would like to know.Footnote: After my familiarity with the movie version, I ordered the CD of the stage production with Crawford and Brightman. Ug, I resold it on Amazon. None of the voices were right to my ears after Butler, Rossum, and Wilson.	5.0	A perfect film..is Beethoven in it?	2007-11-24	6	3	3

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1QL42F1CUYYJU	"JU ""JU"""	First I have to apologize for my english which is not so good. I'm now obsessed with this movie.  I need to listen the sound track of this movie everyday. Gerard Butler is excellent as phantom.  I used to see the broadway several years ago (but not the one with Brightman and Crawford), however, I love both stage musical and the movie.  Both of them are fantastic.  If you watch this movie with un-bias heart, you'll love it. The first time I saw this movie in the theater, I feel unsure that I like it or not because I compare it to the stage show.  After I saw it for the second time, I start to love it very mcuh, so I have to see the third, fourth and so on. Now I addicted to the music as well as Gerard Butler.  I went to the VDO shop and rent every movie having GB starring in them.  I thank Joel and ALW very very much to produce such a great movie for us and for the world.	5.0	I love this movie very very very much	2005-07-11	6	6	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	APDUCWHP5J905	Julia S.	This movie is magnificent. Gerard Butler portrays a very mysterious, dark and sexy phantom, like the phantom is supposed to be. He does a wonderful job in acting and his singing is good considering that he is not an opera singer. Emmy Rossum is spectacular as Christine, young and innocent. Both of them have great chemistry, look great together and show passion.I don't know why people keep saying that the Phantom is too young. He is 35 and Christine is 18. He is much older than her but still young enough to be a love interest. Who wants to see a 50 year old phantom?And as for comparing them to Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, what's the deal with that? I haven't seen the stage show but I downloaded Brightman's and Crawford's The Phantom of the Opera song and they are far from being impressive. Brightman's voice is not as strong as Rossum's, not even close. And Crawford sounds too much like a woman, doesn't strike me as a dark and mysterious phantom. Butler and Rossum are much better actors for the part and they did a much better job at singing.Their is nothing wrong with the movie, the actors are young and pleasant to look at and listen to, the sets are spectacular and the costumes are beautiful.

I loved the way they used younger actors and actresses to really grab your heart.  And that kiss, oh my god, who could ever not agree that the kiss between the phantom and Christine at the end was not the most powerful and emotional kiss you've ever seen?

Though you don't get the full experience of music and movement as if you went to see it live, this was a wonderful adaptation to watch when you're in the mood.  It's also much cheaper than paying for the tickets!The movie was luxurious in color and detail, the cast did a fairly well job of singing and acting.  The whole movie was like watching a dream and was hypnotic at times such as ""The Music of the Night.""  Though not a perfect movie, this was an enjoyable one to watch.  There seemed to be symbolism portrayed as well in the mirrors, the masks people wear and the rose in bloom.I only wish that Michael Crawford could have played the Phantom.  The one who they cast in this movie didn't seem as smooth or as polished in singing.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A140MTC2IKLQ2P	"Julie Riggins ""Unruly Julie"""	"I last saw Phantom in London in June 2004 with John Owen-Jones as the Phantom, Ramin Karimloo as Raoul, and Katie Knight-Adams as Christine.  The London production is the most impressive in the world and I believe there is no other subsequent stage cast that can compare (then again, I haven't been back to London yet). This is especially true for John Owen-Jones (I have to give him a bra-VISSIMO kudos as I write this review, even though he has nothing to do with the movie).  His voice was so powerful and exploding with passion that when he sang ""Music of the Night"", I nearly had to be scraped off the floor and was under a spell for the next 3 days.Then I heard the movie was coming out and was not very happy. My first thought, like so much common sentiment, was that Hollywood would make a train wreck out of the integrity of a story that just did not belong on film.  I turned up my nose.And then last month, I happened to stumble across and be grabbed by the 2nd half of the movie on HBO one night. I made sure to catch it the next time a few nights later in its entirety, which turned into watching it again and again, and I'd keep looking for the next time it was scheduled to air.Okay, I LOVE this movie.  Everything about it is a beautiful work of art - the cinematography, sets, costumes, acting, talent, etc., etc.!  It even clarified parts of the story I had otherwised missed or did not understand during the stage perfomance. Gerard Butler is BEYOND sexy, definitely a younger and more contemporary sort of Phantom, and that is A-okay in my book!  Like so many other reviewers here have said, how could have Christine resisted him!!!Some scenes of interest:  1.  The Don Juan scene and ""Point of No Return"" is hypnotic and HOT HOT HOT! 2. The traveling carnival/history of Phantom as boy is disturbing and sad. I'm not sure how I feel about that particular twist/rendition being made part of him. 3. Christine in the graveyard gave a stellar performance of ""Wishing you Were Here Somehow Here Again"", but I don't know that I liked the swordfight scene between Raoul and the Phantom, nor that the Phantom was nearly defeated.I still cannot believe how this movie not only proved me wrong, but far exceeded my expectations."	5.0	Obsessed with the Movie - 180 Degree Point of No Re-Turn	2006-02-14	5	4	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A9T2WHBZYQTOF	"Julius Andrews ""Isacc"""	"A few years ago, as a valentine's day present, my step-father took my mother to see Phantom of the Opera at the Fox Theatre in St. Louis.  My mom came back with a soundtrack, and I immediately fell in love with it.  The music was incredible, and I knew that I had to see this musical.  Fast-Forward a year or two, and I got the extended two disc soundtrack with extra songs.  Last year, I finally saw Phantom at the Majestic Theatre in New York.  You can imagine my excitement when I heard that a movie version of the musical was coming to theatres.  You can also imagine my dissappointment when I noticed that it was getting less than stellar reviews from my local paper.  Finally, I managed to see the movie myself, and here is the bare truth.First off, before the actual review, a short summary.  It is the late 1800's and the two new managers of the Opera Populaire, Andre and Firmin, are in trouble.  Their leading lady, Carlotta Giudicelli, has quit due to accidents caused by the ""Opera Ghost"" .  Luckily, chorus girl Christine Daae has been taking lessons from a mysterious tutor,(who unbeknownst to her is the Opera Ghost, and is in love with her) and can easily take Carlotta's place.  At that night's perfomance of the opera, Hannibal, she is recognized by Raoul, the Viscount de Chagny, who was her childhood sweetheart.  Their love is rekindled, which really ticks the Phantom off.Now, for the good.  Most of the actors are fairly good.  Emmy Rossum shines as Christine Daae with a look and voice that almost rivals the immortal Sarah Brightman.  Emmy's voice is crystal clear, and has a tone that could melt the hardest of hearts.  The actors playing Andre and Firmin are very good, and very funny.  The actress playing Madame Giry, the ballet mistress and the person who knows the secrets of the phantom, is exceptionally good, and the girl playing her daughter, Meg, is absolutely adorable.  Patrick Wilson, who plays Raoul, sings well but seems to have three emotions he switches between.  Emotional, happy, and nervous.  This gets slightly boring after a while, but thankfully, his singing talent balances this out.  Stealing the spotlight is Minnie Driver as Carlotta.  She is simply hilarious, whether she is shooting off drivel in her accent, or doing a very good job lyp-synching.  Miss Driver even sings the song from the closing credits, ""Learn to Be Lonely"".  The sets are incredible, and the music is fairly faithful to the musical.Now, for the bad.  First of all, several points in the plot have been changed from the musical.  The chandelier no longer falls after ""All I Ask of You (reprise)"", it falls after ""Past the Point of No Return"".  An entire musical section, in which Andre and Firmin and the others recieve notes regarding the production of DON JUAN TRIUMPHANT, has been cut, and the parts of music from here have either been shoved into different parts of the movie or completely cut out.  The entertaining scene in which the cast is trying to learn the music for DON JUAN TRIUMPHANT has been completely cut out.  The good part of this in regards to people that have not seen the musical at all is that, ""No one will know if it is right...no one will care"".  Some new things have been added.  Some of these are good, but some of these are bad.  A swordfight has been added in the graveyard scene, and I'm sure this was done because the mass public just loves a movie that contains a carefully choreographed swordfight, and it gave the editors something exciting to put in the trailers.  From a dramatic standpoint it is pointless for two reasons.  A.)  the Phantom very nearly loses, and this deflates his image as the menacing villain.B.)  the original scene involved the Phantom shooting fireballs from a skull mounted on a pike.  Considering today's movie magic, this would have been easier to do than choreographing an entire swordfight, which is incredibly complicated.Finally, the one thing that drags this down from the incredible spectacle that it could've been is actually the star of the movie, Gerard Butler.  From a pop-culture standpoint he is perfect for the role.  He is good looking, in a way that lonely housewives and widowers absolutely love.  He also has some strange underlying sensuality about him.  As a singer, he leaves much to be desired.  Not that he is bad, in fact he sings fairly well in ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""Music of the Night"" and ""Past the Point of No Return"".  This is, however, an opera, and much of the dialogue is sung.  It is in this sung dialogue that Mr. Butler falls short.  If he is not yelling the lines more than singing them, he is singing them in a very throaty, gravelly, grunting voice that frankly wears on the nerves.  True, he does convey his emotions well, but it would be nice if he could actually attempt to sing while he's emoting.  This is a musical for God's sake.There are a few more bright spots in this movie.  The prologue is done in black and white, which makes that transformation of the opera house even more amazing, and there are brief epilogue scenes every once in a while.  The addition of an instrumental version of ""Learn to Be Lonely"" in a couple a spots (most notably the new ending for the movie, which is an absolute tearjerker.) adds to the emotion of the movie.  Overall, this movie could've been so much better had they at least got someone with a better voice to sing the part of Phantom.  For heaven's sakes, a bunch of very good singers have sung the part, they could've done it.  Then the changes to the plot would've been bearable.  In fact, as is they are bearable.  I just don't like the way that Gerard Butler sings certain parts of this movie, and it is this fact that earns what could've been a spectacular movie an average rating."	3.0	Could've Been So Much Better	2005-05-24	10	4	6

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1V176RDEFNDXO	Kafishna	"Yes, I found the movie to be a mythic tale, or should I say,""tales?""--of masculine feminine, of lovers confused amidst the conflict between love and power , of a beauty and her tormented beast, and ultimately a tragic tale. I never read the original French novel and this is the only version I enjoyed. The production is so rich in its contents and presentation that it's difficult to give credit to a single performer for the wholesome experience. The soundtrack was awesome, and despite the occasional humor, the tragedy never failed to claim on the audience's emotion. What did actually win in the end, love or chivalry? Are they really that different? What was really important to the ""Phantom""--love for the beloved or the love itself?Occasionally, towards the end of the movie, I kept thinking about the Ugly Duckling of Hans Andersen. The movie brought me closer to the conviction I have carried within me that deep down, most of us carry a beast, frustrated in its solitary castle, awaiting a beauty to see through the outer layer and break the curse of solitude, as if a healing awaiting to happen.I encourage you to watch it.Excellent work. Thanks to all involved with the project."	5.0	Myths are always retold in many fashions, but they remain the same	2012-09-21	2	1	1

I would recommend the movie to anyone who loves musicals and love triangles.Like any movie there is good and bad in it.  Unfortunately there was too much bad to make this a 5 star movie. So  in this review I've put some of bad that made the review 4 stars.  But don't worry I've also included the good.Bad1.  Why is Christine in a white dress during ""Think of Me?"" That was Empress Elisabeth of Austria's dress that was made for her portrait by Fanz Xavier Winterhalter not for an opera and her dress didn't go with opera she was in.2.  When we do see the phantom's face it is not very deformed. Everyone makes a big deal of his face and then when you see it your like. ""Wow, is that the best they could do?"" It doesn't scare you or faze you like it should.3.  Emmy Rossum (Christine) gives no emotion to her character. She has a dreamy or surprised look throughout most of the movie. And when Raoul is in danger she does nothing but stands there horrified and quite when really most people would try to do something.Now for the good.Good1. The very begin with the chandelier rising, is spectacular. The music and the color are wonderful.2. The music throughout the whole movie is beautiful, and amazing. It really helps you connect with the movie.3. The singing is gorgeous and allows you to really understand the character.4. When the Phantom and Christine interact together you can see the harmony between them.Well I hope this helped you deicide weather or not to buy this movie."	4.0	Love the Phantom of the Opera	2012-08-21	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1QLMFG5R5IFAM	kam24	I thought overall the movie was pretty good. I think a lot of people hated it because it's very different from the musical which is extremly popular and well known. It also doesn't have much similarity to Leroux's original novel. The movie had a lot to live up to and it didn't live up to it at all. I found that most of my friends who really loved it weren't that famaliar with the story or had never seen the musical. Friends who had seen the musical were a bit more critcal. Being a die hard Phantom fan myself I did find myself getting quite annoyed with some aspects of the film. Now for the good and the bad:Good-The cinematography was beautiful. There were some awesome scences in the movie (Christine's father's grave) which were absoulutly breath taking. Masquerade scence was pretty well done but wasn't as good as seeing it live. Rossum did a mostly good performance of Christine. She has a good voice and portrayed her innocence well. Her's was one of the better singing performances. The guy who played Rauol also did surprisingly well for the character. Everyone knows Rauol is a whining babbling wuss but I didn't find him as annoying in the film. Butler did okay, but I'll get to him later. I also was surprisngly feeling for the Butler at the end. I didn't think his acting would persaude me to do so but it actually did. The acting overall was mostly enertaing and kept me watching.Bad-The lip sinking was horrible. It didn;t even look like they were singing, especially Rossum. It really bugged me because I'm a singer and I KNOW you can't sing with your mouth an inch open. It's kind of ironic that Driver was the most believable singing and she was the only one in the movie who didn't use her actual voice. Okay, I know a lot of people hated Butler and I mostly agree with them. They could have found someone way better. He isn't an altogher bad singer, he was just miscast. They should have found someone with more of a range to their voice. I kinda feel bad for the guy cause when you think of the Phantom you think of Micheal Crawford, and he's hard to beat. Crawford and Sarah Brightan were sooo good and it's hard to match them. Okay the sword fight with Raoul and the Phantom. What was that? We all know Erik could destroy Rauol in a heartbeat. The end of that fight was just stupid. And that backstory with madame giry was horrible. If Erik didn't build the Oprea house then why were there so many secret passageways and how could he be a great arcitect without traveling the world? They just did that to give miranda richardson more screen time. Also, Erik's face wasn't even scary. He barely had a scratch. The thing that bugged me the most was the ending scene. There is no possible way that Erik could have put the ring on her grave. He was 50 when she was 18. He was obvousily not around when she eventually died.Conclusion-To apperiate the film you have to see it as just that: a movie. If you start comparing it to the musical or the book you're going to end up being disappointed. It doesn't hold a candle to the musical. I think it's just something that's more enjoyable live. I would recommend the movie because it's entertaining but don't expect too much or you'll end up disappointed.	3.0	Phantom review	2005-03-08	9	2	7

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3TLY2LWGRULDQ	Karen K. Hart	As I watched Phantom of the Opera on DVD, I was thrilled with everything that had been done in the movie.  It was brilliant to use black and white for the portions of the movie that aren't as vibrant.  It was brilliant to blend the play with some portions of the book that never made it to the play.  And the ability to choose camera angles lent the filmmakers freedom to show us details we might not have been able to pick up from a stage production.I feel like the people who made the film really used available resources to the best of their potential, and they deserve applause for that.  There were times when actors appeared to be lip-synching because their mouths seemed not to be open far enough to let such powerful sound emerge, but maybe their lungs are just that strong.  Also, the Phantom struck me as being a little on the young side--it's hard for a handsome young man to keep the dark, disturbing father-figure thing going.Still, I thought the movie was fantastic.  Great acting, great (if sometimes obvious) use of color, wonderful subtleties in many areas.	5.0	Excellent, excellent portrayal.	2005-05-30	4	3	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1IOJE0W1NXOSE	Karen Potts	"Soaring music, tense drama, beautiful sets--it's all there!  I didn't think that anything could top the experience of the stage production of ""Phantom"", but this movie does an amazingly good job of adapting the timeless story to the screen.  Emmy Rossum hits all the right notes (no pun intended) as the winsome heroine who is torn between her love of the Angel of Music and Raoul, and Gerard Butler is convincing as the tormented Phantom.  Patrick Wilson's role is not nearly as interesting as the other two in the triangle, but his vocals add a welcome dimension to the duets and trios.  Minnie Driver is a wonderful Prima Dona and the other supporting roles are played convincingly.  The movie captures the magic of the play, especially in the large production numbers and adds an extra dimension afforded by close-ups and adaptability of settings.  This movie is highly recommended!"	5.0	Exquisite!	2005-06-11	4	3	1

The Phantom of the Opera is my absolute favorite musical and I was looking foward to seeing the movie. I have seen the Phantom on stage and loved it. I also own the Original Cast Recording which is absolutely phenomenal.Gerard Butler was miscast as the Phantom. He doesn't have the voice to have a lead role in a musical. He sounded like he had a horrible cold the entire movie. He couldn't reach the high or low notes and barely held those in between. The acting was mostly bland and some scenes were way too creepy for my taste. Raoul looked ridiculous and Christine seemed awfully stiff and rigid the whole movie. Did she ever change expressions?All in all the movie just didn't live up to my expectations.	2.0	Disappointing	2005-06-27	8	5	3

The music is phenominal; the actors are superb; and the story, well, what's not to LOVE about a ""Beauty and the Beast"" plot?  What makes this movie so incredibly heart-wrenching, is how utterly lonely the Phantom is and always was.  It tears your heart out.  I've seen this over and over again, and each time I watch it, I get even more out of it.  I listen to the CD in my car, and I can visualize the whole movie.  As talented as they both are, Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman are just too over-the-top with their characters, but then, that's the stage for you.  This movie version drills deep into your soul - something you could never get on the stage.  To you, Joel Schumaker and Andrew Lloyd Webber, I applaud you:  ""Brava!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1S2YTVZAS362V	Katie	My take from the reviews is that everyone loved it except those for whom Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman are the only ones to play the Phantom and Christine.  I find the entire movie entrancing and have watched it repeatedly.  I have also now read the book, twice, and I think it is sadly lacking in depth and imagination with comparison to the movie version of the story.  I don't understand criticism of Gerry Butler's voice.  He has a powerful, strong, and pure voice.  What he does is to act certain bits rather than singing them, using a rough and growling voice to communicate the emotion of the Phantom.  An example is bits of the final scene in his lair where he communicates an extraordinary range of emotions--vulnerability, adolescent cockiness, viciousness, rage, tenderness,heartbreak.  His version of Music of the Night is a good example of his capability to sing with crystalline purity of tone.  The other criticism I don't understand is of Patrick Wilson.  Bland?  I see him as providing a picture perfect portrayal of the ultimate romantic hero.  His loyalty, his bravery, his tenderness with Christine--I can't watch him without thinking, yes, he is truly the sane choice!  It does seem unfair that he was blessed with looks and position.  However, let's not forget that Christine loved him since she was a child, when she had a schoolgirl crush on him (and he on her).  Butler's phantom is sexy but running off with a serial killer?  I don't think so.	5.0	Mesmerizing	2012-02-20	5	4	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1FFG3SDA8ICLH	Katieswaz	I have to tell you I went in with some tremendous trepidations! A man who didn't even know he could sing until a year ago. A sixteen year old girl! A director who nearly destroyed the Batman series who has said some very mean-sprited comments about those of us who keep the hit musical going for over 7000 performances and 17 years! Not my recipe for a great film. But being a fan of the sublime music I went and I wanted to see it before I spoke out against (If I was going to). Being an avid phan since 1992 at the age of fifteen. And after seeing the show 5 times. I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful Gerry Butler who I've been a fan of since Atilla! He's technically too young and sexy to play Erik! (Sorry, my Angel!) After all, Erik was 54 when met the 18 year old Christine! Giving his obsession a lecherous feel. Although his beautiful voice isn't the best I've heard in the title role it worked. Emmy Rossum although has a beautiful clear voice but it was very heard to hear her especially when she is singing with her male co-stars! Patrick Wilson was suffient as Raoul, a lovely voice, fine actor! But had awful hair! Looking more like a country bubkin with a lot money rather than a 'slave of fashion'. My other problems with the movie is that Erik lost his magic such as the magical lasso, being able to raise the gate to his lair with the motion of his hand, making Carlotta sing like a toad by sheer will. The moving of the destruction of the chandelier annoyed me and was pointless! Then there's the make-up job on GB face was far from the scary art that is put into every night. After all, the line is 'so deformed it was hardly a face' I think a woman could easily forgive that face especially when the other 3/4 was as gorgeous of GB's! The Angel of Music lost his genius, he was a child prodigy(playing Mozart at the age of three), magician, inventor, the official assassin for the Shah of Persia, a composer, and an artitect (rumored to be the silent partner to the man who is documented as the designer of The Paris Opera and the brains behind it.) To see what mean I urge everyone who hasn't seen the show to see the fabulous Hugh Panaro (who is very sexy w/o the make-up), Sandra Joseph and the commanding John Cudia!	3.0	I'm torn!	2005-02-05	2	1	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AZUXTLKEML5UB	Kat's review	Gerard Butler is reason enough to see this movie. Having only seen Gerard in one or two other roles I was surprised to see him in a musical. His voice talent is very good and for the first time you can't understand why Christine wont dump Raoul and leave with The Phantom. Gerard simply makes this version of The Phantom...well...Sexy, even when he is unmasked. And Christine is young and very well played. Her voice is beautiful.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3M6QKNFH8ZI45	Kayla	I was pleased to see that Webber, an experienced musicial playwright was making his hit musicial, Phantom of the Opera, into a movie. I studied the Phantom of the Opera a couple years back. I read a play, saw a cartoon, and watched the silent movie and musicial from the 70's. It was really interesting.The time that the movie came to my town, I was so excited. It was getting close to my birthday and I was so ecstatic to go see the movie, as I was promised. On my birthday, turns out, the movie wasn't playing anymore. So, I never got to see it until now. I am proud to say that it is a great movie, but the musicial is better, I have heard.I give this 4 stars. Why not 5 you ask? Because the book is always better!

(I hope!!)I loved it, husband thought it was ok and happy he saw it..once.  It haunts me, I love the type of movie it is anyway.  But everything about it stays with me.  As others have said, I can not get the music out of my head..and not at all unhappy about that.I heard the cd of the London cast, and it was nice and had great voices.  But I think Butler's is the best for the part. It makes one care about the Phantom.  Makes you wish he could be happy, makes you (ok this may only be a female thing. lol) fall in love with the Phantom at the same time you are repulsed by how he controls and even kills.I knew I would like it if only for the music, as I love ANY scores that Webber does.  I have not been able to see any but what he turns into movies, but I have heard, if only on cd's, other of his works and love them all.  But I never dreamed I would fall in love with this movie the way I have.I can not even explain why.  I fear I will wear the DVD out once I do get it.	5.0	Fall in love with the movie...see it	2005-02-18	13	13	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2SU7H37GCQDOW	K. Calderone	"It's close to 20 years now since the morning my symphonic band director in college walked into class and said, ""You guys have got to hear this,"" and those magnificent chords reverberated at full volume off the cement block walls. Phantom has been a fixture of my musical life ever since, and after I finally got to see it on Broadway 3 years ago, I would not have believed my experience of it could get any better.Then comes this movie, and after 8 viewings, I remain awestruck. You've no doubt seen a few reviews criticizing the cast, and Gerard Butler in particular for not having any artistry comparable to Michael Crawford's. For my part, I find these criticisms ridiculous. The film is an intrepid endeavor to transcend the stage production - a tall order, to say the least.To me, the movie did an incredible job of fleshing out the stage play, and criticisms of Butler are misplaced. My dad probably said it best: in the stage play, they seemed to go out of their way to make you wonder if the Phantom truly was nothing more than an apparition created by mass hysteria. In the movie, they went out of their way to make him real as a man. To that end, Butler's performance was OUTSTANDING. Often strained, always gruff - even raw - Butler's voice was nonetheless usually well intoned with occasional glimpses of its own artistry. His performance gave the tormented, suffering soul of the Phantom an emotional authenticity that the refined voice of Michael Crawford never really did for me.I'll admit that with my first viewing of the film, I was less than wowed by Patrick Wilson, despite his very good vocal performance. But after I thought about it a little, I found his ""understated charm"" to be the perfect counterbalance to the forceful, commanding, and darkly seductive Phantom. Wilson perfectly conveyed the groundedness that Christine so desparately needed. He also did a wonderful job of making the character's main flaw the over-confidence of youth; and the great surprise such a young man might feel at having himself tested. He was the perfect breath of fresh air after being lost in the ""dungeon of black despair"" with the Phantom.As for Emmy Rossum: again, the casting choice here gave the character an emotional authenticity I always found just a little lacking in the stage production. The role commands a vocal maturity that is typically cast by women well beyond the character's emotional age. (Sarah Brightman and The Leading Ladies, for example, were in their late 20's to early 30's in their debut performances.) This lovely, YOUNG, and extremely talented girl made Christine utterly engaging as you watch her coming of age and developing an identity apart from her father's memory.In short, the stage production, for me, has come to be an exercise of the imagination - a ghost story. The movie is a study in primal human emotions, and easily succeeds in stirring every one of them: loneliness, rage, grief, lust, fear, frustration, joy, and love - they're all there, and the film draws you in to experience them right along with the characters.It's hard to sum this up, but a pivotal scene made this movie the creme de la creme of film for me, totally separate from the usual Hollywood fare. Late in the film, the black knight drives a team of black horses to the cemetery, drawing the heroine into his trap; and the white knight gallops, riding bareback, through a misty dawn to save her. Most films offend me when they use melodramatic imagery like this to try and stir me. ""Phantom,"" by contrast, succeeded absolutely. It succeeded because the cast and the filmmakers didn't try to impose these personas on the characters at the start. By the time the film reaches the ride to the cemetery, you already know that there is nothing supernatural about the Phantom - he's a dark, powerful, seductive presence preying upon the grief and imagination of a teenage girl. And there's nothing supernatural about the hero, either. He's simply ungiven to any eccentricities of emotion or imagination - but he's also unsparing in his adoration. As such, Raoul becomes an anchor, a rescuer and the perfect romantic figure to the emotionally wrought 17 year old. By the time you see the Phantom cloaked in a black cape driving black horses, and Raoul in the flowing white shirt astride the white horse, there's no need for future contrivances for either character to live up to the imagery: they've already been elevated to those romantic positions in our imaginations.Minnie Driver, Ciaran Hinds, Simon Callow, and James Fleet are not incidental in their comic relief roles: they're all fantastic in their own right, as are Victor Maguire, Jennifer Ellison and Murray Melvin in minor supporting roles. Miranda Richardson is a deep and intriguing Mme. Giry. (Is it a sisterly concern she has for the Phantom, or is she a little in love with him herself?) I can't say I cared much for Kevin McNally as Buquet, but it occurs to me that was the point of that character.It's hard to imagine any greater perfection being brought to this timeless story than what's been achieved by this film. The storyline, the music, the cinematography, the effects - nothing is missing."	5.0	SUPERLATIVE	2005-03-17	35	33	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AAZMTNXV0BOIG	"K. Chelsen ""kchelsen"""	"As a long-time fan of the stage show, I was excited to hear they were finally bringing it to the big screen.  I was not disappointed.  This film was well worth the wait.Sumptuous, lavish, it is, for the most part, faithful to the stage production. The changes/additions to the film -- back stories for Christine and the Phantom, a duel instead of fireballs in the cemetery, and more about Old Raoul after the auction -- only served to enhance the story.Performances by all involved were extremely well done.  Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds were perfect as the inexperienced Opera managers, trying to boost their way up the social ladder.  As Madame Giry, Miranda Richardson brought softness to the character, who generally comes across as overly stern in the stage show.  Minnie Driver as Carlotta was your classic difficult diva, and was very funny.  Singing by the managers and Madame Giry was good, considering these actors are not known as singers.  Ms. Driver's singing was dubbed by Margaret Preece, a former member of the London stage cast.  The voice was a bit overblown and strident... just like a diva past her prime. Kudos to Ms. Preece for her excellent voice workWhich brings me to the three leads.  As Raoul, Broadway performer Patrick Wilson was perfectly cast.  Behind the gentlemanly demeanor of the young peer was a steely resolve as he strove to keep the woman he loved from being taken away by the unknown specter.  His singing was exemplary -- it was easy to see why he has been nominated twice for a Tony award.Emmy Rossum was simply beautiful -- in looks, acting and in voice. She ran the gamut of emotions in this film, going from an insecure chorus girl to a confident young woman struggling to save the man she loved.  Her high note in her first song, ""Think of Me,"" sent a shiver up my spine.  Her singing continued to impress me throughout the film as her voice seemed to get better and better.  Her performance as Amnita in the Phantom's Opera was outstanding.Gerard Butler.  He was unknown to me prior to the announcement that he had been chosen to play the title role.  I made a point of checking out some of his films, and found him to be a very fine actor. I felt confident that he would do the role justice.  I did have some reservations when I learned that he had very little prior singing experience.  However, my reservations dissipated when I first heard the soundtrack highlights, and then saw him on the screen.  Gerard Butler WAS the Phantom. He brought to vivid life all the passion the Phantom felt for his music, his anger and frustration at the deal life had dealt him and the love he felt for Christine.  This last can be seen especially during the Masquerade scene where the Phantom has crashed the party and presents the managers with his opera.  After the Phantom sings about Christine returning to him, his teacher, he looks at her and suddenly is still. With only his eyes, Mr. Butler revealed the enormity of the love and longing the Phantom felt for Christine.  That scene went right to my heart. While his singing voice was a bit rough around the edges, it was very effective in conveying the emotion of the character as the song required.  His anger and hurt in the reprise of ""All I Ask of You"" sent chills up my spine.  He was seductive as he sang ""Music of the Night,"" which is my favorite song from this show.  ""Point of No Return,"" the duet with Emmy Rossum, was simply fantastic.  Their chemistry ignited that song, making it more sensuous than I had ever seen before.  The final scene in the Phantom's lair with all three members of the triangle was heartbreaking, particularly when the Phantom realized he could not keep Christine with him.  Mr. Butler's Phantom accomplished what no stage Phantom ever did  -- he moved me to tears.I've read several comments in which people felt that as the Phantom, Mr. Butler was too good looking, and that the deformity was not horrific enough.  While it is not as over-the-top horrific as the stage deformity, when seen in sharp contrast to the almost perfect left side of his face, the deformity is indeed horrific.  I certainly found it easy to understand why he was shunned by society.The film was beautiful, from the costumes to the sets.  It was everything I expected it to be and more.  I especially liked the ""postscript"" black and white ending, with its little twist.  My only criticism has to do with Point of No Return -- I thought the addition of the dancers was unnecessary, and was more an annoying distraction than anything else.I cannot recommend this film highly enough, especially if you are a fan of this show and musicals in general."	5.0	Brava, Brava, Bravissima!	2005-01-22	11	10	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A26FES1WJXD4ZY	Kelly Green	Where do I begin?  The stage design, costumes, lighting, etc. are fabulous. Gerard Butler as the Phantom is miscast or misdirected, even though I think he gave it his all.  He is too handsome and not nearly ugly enough under the mask, and he smiles too much.  The Phantom doesn't smile! He needed to be weirder, more sinister, and frightening, with a little perversity thrown in, yet still sexy. My main complaint is the last, and most important scene of the movie - it is all wrong, and I blame the director.  The Phantom cries like a wimp, and the kiss scene between him and Christine is terrible.  If you are a fan of the play/musical, as I am,than of course you must see the movie, however,it had such potential to be really fabulous with just a few changes, but was such a disappointment.	2.0	Overall  Disappointing	2005-05-06	11	3	8

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2PXHFGJZBNLXB	Kenji Fujishima	"Andrew Lloyd Webber's Broadway musical version of Gaston Leroux's Gothic horror tale of The Phantom of the Opera is one of the most popular musicals of all time---it's still running, at the Majestic Theater---but, going into Joel Schumacher's film adaptation of the musical, I had never seen it onstage (nor have I read the book). I had heard some of the original cast recording, and marveled at Michael Crawford's intensity and vocal beauty in the role of the lovelorn Phantom. Otherwise, I basically went into the film cold...and, with some qualifications, that's the way I left.Oh, it's not a terrible movie, I suppose. I, for one, am perfectly willing to defend Lloyd Webber's often-derided music: it may be derivative; and Lloyd Webber may not know the first thing about musical development (doesn't ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" sound too much like...well, every other big ballad in the musical, especially ""Angel of Music""?); but, at climactic points, it is so lusciously orchestrated that, especially towards the end, I couldn't help but be enchanted by the score. I was much less enchanted by the lyrics, which seems so divorced from context that I stopped paying attention to the words after a while.Additionally, I have to admit, as simply a parade of visual glamor, Joel Schumacher makes an ideal leader. He has an unmistakable eye for beautiful imagery, both pretty and creepy. His imagining of Paris from the rooftop of the Paris Opera is breathtaking; so is the image of Christine walking through falling snow in a cemetery. Some of the imagery is pretty amazing...but it amazes only as eye candy, with very little expressive depth to the images other than its own slick pictorial wonderfulness.And that, in essence, is what is wrong with this movie: for all of its romantic huffing and puffing, this Phantom of the Opera lacks soul. The central romantic triangle between the poor Phantom (Gerard Butler), soprano Christine (Emmy Rossum), and Christine's boyfriend Raoul (Patrick Wilson) has all the weight of something out of a high school drama. And, fatally, there is very little terror or romantic warmth to be found in any of this overbaked film's agonizingly labored 143 minutes. It's all cinematographer John Mathieson's pretty pictures in the service of a thin and ultimately uninvolving plot. (Surely, Gaston Leroux's book must have been something more than a mere Gothic soap opera.) Only at the end do the filmmakers generate a palpable feeling of sadness---but, by then, I felt too exhausted to make much of an effort to connect with the characters.A word about the performances. Of the three leads, Patrick Wilson has the worst luck; he's saddled with a bland, personality-free character, and unfortunately Wilson---so much more involving as tortured gay Mormon Joe Pitt in Mike Nichols' HBO miniseries Angels in America---does little to bring life to the underwritten part. As the Phantom, Butler is more effective---he's at his most touching in the film's grand finale---but he certainly doesn't efface memories of Michael Crawford, either vocally or emotionally. (Not only that, but Butler is way too young and handsome for the part of the ugly, father-figure Phantom; when his mask finally comes off, he looks less like Lon Chaney---who played the Phantom in Rupert Julian's 1925 horror film version of the story---than a GQ model with scar tissue.) Emmy Rossum, of course, has garnered most of the acclaim from this movie. She is an appealing young actress who can sing (although her singing voice doesn't come close to suggesting one that would earn her popularity as an opera singer; for all her limitations as an actress, Sarah Brightman at least sounded operatic), but, truth be told, I found her performance bland overall. As hard as she tried to convey desperation and yearning, I rarely felt that Rossum truly felt those emotions herself; those facial expressions of hers as she is being seduced seem more calculated than spontaneous. The only actor in the cast who makes a real impression is Minnie Driver, who hams it up impressively as Carlotta, the overbearing diva with an Italian accent two miles wide. It's a humorous caricature, but she's not onscreen for very long.In short, only if you value visual and aural glitz over genuine emotional substance will you find this Phantom of the Opera to be worthwhile. Otherwise, I'd say skip it."	3.0	Great visuals, good music, but overall a disappointing movie	2005-05-11	11	4	7

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A30TK6U7DNS82R	Kevin Killian	"I never saw The Phantom Of The Opera when it was a stage musical.  Some of the songs were familiar over the years especially The Music Of The Night.  But outside of that, I didn't even know what the story was, however I assumed it was similar to the novel and to the old Claude Rains 40 Universal movie, which I've seen.  In fact I saw the Hammer version too from 1963.  And the Argento version as well so I guess you can say I'm seen a few versions of this tale before.  But the story as told by Andrew Lloyd Webber has a few twists and turns I never heard before, especially the ""quasi Elephant Man"" background of the Phantom.  And the way that the Miranda Richardson character holds the secret to the Phantom's past, having known him when they were both kidsAnyhow the picture held us spellbound for over two hours, and at the end of the movie when the credit came on, ""Directed by Joel Schumacher,"" about half the audience stood and clapped, never saw that before in a movie!  And you should have heard the screams during the one portion when the Phantom loses his ask onstage (I am trying to word this to avoid spoilers).  A shriek ran throught the audience as we sat there stunned and overwhelmed with horror like a Julia Kristeva apothegm!  My wife thought Gerard Butler was so sexy she says she wants to see every film he's ever been in.All the actors were good.  Even Minnie Driver (and her song she sings over the credits at the end of the movie is delightful--I wonder if that could be her real voice?)Now somebody help me out here!  What is the story with Meg, the young daughter of Miranda Richardson who sorts of looks like Britney Spears when she was starting out.  Is Meg supposed to be in love with the Phantom?  Does she wind up with him?  Why does she take the mask?  Or is she the daughter of the Phantom?  The movie had a few loose ends but this is one that I've been trying to piece out, what is the truth about Meg?  And why doesn't she have a French name?  Or is Meg a French name?Anyway, I recommend this movie to all.  I went into it a skeptic, and I came out of it a total convert.  It's people like me who spread the word of mouth that makes a film a monster hit.  Hope it succeeds.  If you ask me, it should win the Oscar and sucks to The Aviator or whatever.  And when they have the Oscar clip, the part they should show is the part where Christine sings,""Beautiful creature of darkness, what kind of life have you known?God, give me courage to show you.....

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1KJXLMJFCSMWV	killerwhaletank	"I have mixed feelings about this movie.  I'm glad I saw it, because I've always enjoyed the story of the Phantom of the Opera; they did some things right in the movie, but I feel that they dropped the ball on a lot of other things.  I haven't seen the play so I can't compare it except to say that it seems that this particular screenplay would probably be much more breathtaking on stage than on the silver screen.  Moments like when the chandelier falls seem like they would be phenomenal in a live play, but on a movie screen came out as just sort of ho-hum.  Movie audiences are so jaded when it comes to spectacular special effects that it takes a lot to wow us, and this movie didn't quite do it.  That said, the sets were quite beautiful even if a few special effects moments that they could have really played up in the film (like the chandelier, or Erik's mirrored torture chamber) didn't carry enough impact.Overall... it was worth seeing once, but I'd rather see the play than watch the movie for a second time.  I really recommend the book, though.The Good:Emmy Rossum was wonderful as Christine.  I love Gerard Butler as an actor, but I wasn't overly impressed with his singing in the movie, which is unfortunate since the character of the Phantom is supposed to be an unparalleled musical genius and I didn't get that sense.  The score was mostly in tact from the stage production (I haven't seen the play but love the original cast soundtrack) and as I said, they did a good job with the sets.  Minnie Driver is a gem as Carlotta.  It's one of the better movie adaptations of Gaston Leroux's book (which might not say much since some of the others are real stinkers).The Bad:It felt like they were trying way too hard to put a stage production onto the screen and never took advantage of the opportunity to do things in a movie that are impossible on stage.  It was a missed opportunity.  I also didn't like how they portrayed Erik in the movie.  In Gaston Leroux's novel, Erik is a fascinating character that does terrible things and yet somehow at the end you still want him to triumph.  His dark sense of humour and misapplied genius make him into a powerful, larger than life character that is always one step ahead of everyone else.  In the movie, he comes across more as just some lunatic running around in the bowels of the Opera House instead of a darkly twisted mastermind.  It takes away too much of the power of the character, and I thought the swordfighting scene between Erik and Raoul in the movie was a colossal mistake.I REALLY disliked the implication in the movie that Erik is more of a fatherly figure to Christine before he falls in love with her.  (This does not happen in the book.)  It makes his obsession with her seem unpleasant and revolting instead of compelling and sad.I didn't like the character of Madame Giry.  I think it's because I liked the character of the Persian so much in the book, and since there's no Persian in the movie, Madame Giry is the one that takes on some facets of that character's role.  In the book, the relationship between Erik and Madame Giry was much better.  She carried out requests for him and he took care of her and her daughter.  She was more in awe of the Phantom and thought he was a real ghost, and he was more like a patron to her and Meg instead of Madame Giry being the one to act as the mother figure to Erik.Lastly, they really dropped the ball with the ending... the torture chamber and Erik's lair could have been so much better, instead it seems kind of silly and pointless, and without having read the book I don't think there was any real impact or significance to the whole ""hand at the level of your eyes"" thing (to save them from the lasso) or Erik's little torture chamber.  There was a big eye-rolling moment when Erik's mask comes off at the end because there's no consistency between his look with the mask and without it.  His hair all of a sudden changes and it's silly."	3.0	Movie's okay... book is better.	2006-01-06	6	1	5

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A25LP4VXNRQ04P	Kimberly Gotich	Let me begin by stating the I love the stage production of Phantom of the Opera...it was my first musical and it has enthralled me ever since.I enjoyed the movie and will add it to my collection when it is released but I really feel that sometimes stage cannot be duplicated on film and I think this is the problem here. The film is beautiful but at times it was unable to draw you in - my first problem being with the scene where the phantom takes Christine from her dressing room. The stage aspect of this is amazing with its dark visual and the music that is playing but the film was dull and unbelievable at this point. I think it was because it was borrowing from another movie with the intro of a horse but it just did not work. The scene started off great with them walking down the dark hallway with the candle light but then it just goes bad.I also did not enjoy the graveyard scene where the Phantom is beaten in the sword fight. The point of the Phantom is that he is a man of magic...just when you think you have him - you realize you do not for he always as a way out.  All through the musical...he always has a way out.I also had a problem with the actor they cast for the Phantom.  He was great but he was not the Phantom. The Phantom's ability to manipulate Christine comes from him being older and more experienced in the ways of the world.  This guy was working strictly on his sex appeal and I just could not buy that he was the phantom.The young lady who plays Christine was very good and I enjoyed her performance. I also enjoyed Minnie Driver as Carlotta - she was very good and I loved the way she took the character and let us poke fun of her.If you have not seen the stage production, then do yourself a big favor and see it first then see the movie...I think you will agree that on this particular musical - stage is better.	4.0	Good but can't beat stage production...	2005-02-21	6	1	5

Emmy Rossum delievered a stunning performance as Chirstine who is charming, sweet, and innocent-- I can only hope to see more of her-especially on-stage. But, the best performance in my opinon came from Patrick Wilson who plays Chirstine's protector and lover he does a simply stunning job and I find myself falling in love with him each time I hear his beautiful voice. Gerard Butler in my opinon was a poor choice for the mysterious Phantom who takes control of Christine's mind- his voice didn't seem to fit the role despite the fact that he is the veteran stage performer in this movie.The newly added song is perfect for the feel of the movie and is beautifully sung by Minnie Driver in the end credits. There are a few moments I will skip watching this DVD ""Prima Donna"" will be one of them.All in all this a beautiful movie and it's one to own in your collection especially if you love musicals or the movie ""Moulin Rouge.""

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2BFBUOJFAW3VF	Kindle Customer	Sometimes I wonder about writing a review, because other people have said it already.  The value in these cases, I suppose, lies in adding weight to an expressed viewpoint.  So...First, it has been said that those who dislike Webber's musicals, or Joel Schumacher's movies, might dislike this movie...probably true, and is this really a surprise?  In any event, I watched this movie on DVD this past weekend with my wife--a moderate Phantom fan--and two friends who like me are huge fans of the musical Phantom and have seen it multiple times.  We all thought the movie was an excellent film translation of the musical.  (And the three of us who are big Phantom fans had been concerned whether this movie would fall flat like so many other musical to film examples.)As far as the diehard fans of the ALW musical...I think people should approach this movie with an open mind, and admit I may not have.  We all agreed after watching the movie that Butler was a bit of a weak Phantom from the singing standpoint, but acted the part with great skill and intensity.  But after reflecting a few days, I think Stephen King is right...people get hung up on one expression of a character by an actor, and don't keep an open mind when a new expression of that character comes along from a different actor.  Butler is good.  He's not Michael Crawford, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  Butler creates a new Phantom, and does a pretty good job on Music of the Night and a powerful Point of No Return.Emmy Rossum was fabulous as Christine in all respects...perhaps not Sarah Brightman, but that is not a problem unless you make it one.  (Really, Emmy is beyond good enough.  I think the good buzz surrounding her performance is well-deserved.  I further think she proves more than one person can inhabit and own a role, even a popular character.)  We were OK with Patrick Wilson, who played Raoul--I didn't think he was wooden, exactly, but I'll admit he was not inspiring the way many actors have made Raoul in musical productions.  On this I'll stick to my guns...this isn't a comparison with the musical issue.  Wilson simply does not put the depth of emotion into Raoul that should be there.  Other characters were pretty good.  I think Minnie Driver was great, and do not think it is relevant her songs were dubbed.Schumacher's vision for the movie was, I think, very impressive overall.  Yes, there may be some over-the-top elements.  Yet there are also truly wonderful scenes, in particular the opening sequence as the Phantom theme plays and the theater is transformed, Christine's scene in the graveyard, and the final parts of the movie.  I know I'm forgetting some.  The costumes and sets are amazing; the special effects are both good and not overwhelming.  Upshot...We were mesmerized watching this movie.I'm buying this DVD when I finish writing this review.  If you love the musical Phantom, you will probably at least like this movie, and maybe more.  Would it have been nice to see Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman in a movie version of Phantom?  Sure, I guess, twenty years ago.  On the other hand, in 2005 this is the movie we have to see, and I think it is well-worth seeing and adding to your library, and that all concerned did a great job.	5.0	A Great Film Version of Phantom of the Opera Musical	2005-05-31	4	4	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2NNTNC715AJ50	"Kindle Customer ""JKM"""	I'm not a fan of musicals.  I hate almost all of them.  The only other musical I like was Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. I never saw the Broadway productin of The Phantom of the Opera and I am not a fan of Joel Schumacher, the man who killed Batman.  I didn;t like Phone Booth and overall, I think he is a mediocre director.  In The Phantom of the Opera, Schumacher outdoes himself.  He faithfully follows Webber's play, but he also improves upon making the battle for Christine's soul in a major fight between good and evil and making his Phantom a person who is evil and clearly thinks he is above every one else.  Emmy Rossum is fantastic as Christine.  Her voice is lovely, but she is able to pull off the conflicted young woman with aplomb.  The scene where she sings in the theater for the first time is pure magic and the scene in the graveyard before the fight is heartbreaking.  Gerard Butler is a fine villain.  He makes the transition between sophisticated gentleman and psychopath at will.  The harshness in his voice contrasts well with Rossum's polished vocals.  Minnie Driver is outrageous as Collatta and Patrick Wilson is fine as Rauol.  Overall, I totally enjoyed this film and I'm not a fan of musicals, but this one is excellent.	5.0	Excellent adaptation, excellent film	2005-07-04	7	7	0

"We had seen only the original silent movie, not the stage play, (or even the soundtrack) before going.  So we knew not what to expect.  But at the very opening, as the long-dead chandelier rises to life, swinging in what seems like one endless arc, and scatters the colour of memories about as it flames back to life, and the theatre is washed in colour and majesty not seen in decades... we both knew this was going to be good.  And it was.When it comes to sets, scenery and cinematography, they spared no expense.  Every scene is drenched in rich detail.  At the risk of sounding the heretic, I must say that a movie version removes the limitations of space and time to set up the stage, and so has the upper hand in the scenery and sets department.  Some of these shots must have taken weeks to compose, and I'm glad they invested the time.The music is just wonderful.  I'd dare say that even if you are not a musical fan, if you are at least romantically inclined, you will LOVE this movie.  By the end of some songs, like, ""All I ask of you"" I'm restraining myself from singing the song out loud with them!The movie kind of departs from the setting of the original silent movie, in which the Phantom is actually quite hideous.  This Phantom is more ""mysterious"" than hideous.  But the attraction between him and Christine is pure, raw sensual.  I mean it borders on erotic it's so strong.  During ""Past the point of no return"" I'm sitting there with my wife, literally falling under the spell myself.  ""Yea... maybe she *should* be with this guy after all.  I mean, he knows how to make her move, and she definately responds to his touch...""  But that's the whole point.  She WAS influenced by him, and he did cast a strong spell, and he was very alluring.  The movie made it so real I was beginning to feel it myself.Definately worth seeing in a theatre if you can.  Don't wait for the DVD.  See it BIG and LOUD."	5.0	WOW!  What a visual, audio and sensual feast  !!!	2005-01-07	9	9	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ATBPQSSHX3I7Z	Kirsten	Although I have never seen the stage production, I do own a soundtrack of the original cast.  I must say this pales in comparison.  The two largest problems with this is that Emmy Rossum can sing but not act and Gerard Butler can act but not sing.  Hardly a recipe for something wonderful.  Rossum goes through the movie with two expressions, open-mouthed horror and open-mouthed awe.  Butler, while he can keep pitch, does nothing close to justice to the incredible songs he has to sing.  The actor of Raoul was fairly disappointing as well, not being what one would imagine a young dashing hero to be.  The scene of him arriving on a white horse was especially cliched.  It didn't help that the fight that follows was pretty unexciting.That being said, it is a gorgeous looking movie.  The sets and costumes are incredible and actually seeing what is happening does clarify some things on the soundtrack.  I was let down by the masquerade ball however.  Having everyone in black and white didn't make any sense, especially in contrast to the lyric's description of the ball itself.  The Phantom in red could still have been stunning without the rest of the costumes being so drab.All in all I was disappointed.  They certainly could have picked better actors/singers to play the leads.	2.0	Visually stunning but could have been much better	2007-06-29	3	0	3

The movie has been out for so long that the only place I could find to see it was a little over an hour away from where I live. Even so, it was worth every mile and minute I spent on the road.  It is now my favorite movie ever, and one of, if not THE best movie ever made.  I can't believe how many movie ""critics"" slammed this movie.  This move is outstanding!  The cast was outstanding!  Gerard Butler as the Phantom was amazing.  He's the reason why woman have fantasies.  He's so incredibly sexy, and sensual, and just oozes charisma.  And when he sings...Mmm, it's your soul that takes flight and you wish it were you he was dragging down to the dungeon of his black despair!  I could not imagine anyone else playing the Phantom...Even Michael Crawford.  He absolutely moves you to tears with the way he conveys everything that the Phantom is feeling and going through with his eyes.  You FEEL his pain, his anger, and the love he has for Christine.  He truly is an incredibly talented actor and singer.  And Emmy Rossum as Christine is amazing and also does a great job with conveying all the emotions and feelings of Christine.  My only complaint about the DVD is I wish it had A LOT more footage of Gerard and Emmy recording the songs and a lot more of the ""making"" of the movie.Bravo!

I am glad they didn't try to duplicate the stage show.  With a film, you can see the actors' faces and see the emotions.  It's more intimate.  They were wise to capitalize on this.  Gerard Butler is quite charismatic on the screen and it's easy to see how Christine might be torn between him and Raoul.  Emmy Rossum is marvelous!  What a presence she has on screen, especially for a person so young!  Her singing voice is beautiful with an innocent quality to it.  Patrick Wilson, who played Raoul, has a truly beautiful singing voice.  I appreciate that they made him more of a swashbuckling hero in the movie.I have noticed that a lot of people criticize this movie by the way it relates to the stage show.  I don't get this criticism, truly I do  not.  For one thing, Andrew Lloyd Webber himself was intimately involved with the making of this film.  He was there when the principal roles were cast.  ""Behind the Mask,"" a documentary featured in the extras on the 2nd disk, has interviews of him where he says that he wanted his Phantom to have a ""rock and roll"" sensibility to him.  With Gerard Butler, he got it!  Not only did Butler do a fine job with the singing, his acting was incredible! I don't think Michael Crawford, as lovely as his voice is, has the screen presence Butler has.  Films and Stage productions must be different by definition, and I think the filmmakers were wise to recognize this.  As ALW said in the interview, if you don't have the contrast between the ""dangerous"" Phantom and the lovely lyric tenor Raoul, you don't see why Christine might be attracted to the Phantom.  I must say I agree."	5.0	One of the best movies of 2004	2005-05-15	8	7	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AWJ4OO1GCEJ6V	"K. Nish ""Wild Girl Yonder"""	"I just watched this film and my title is the only way I can describe it.  I have seen the stage version 4 times, with Crawford, Guilliame and others playing in the starring role.  I saw Sarah Brightman and Steven Barton playing Christine and Raoul as well.  And while it isn't really fair to compare, it is done.Overall, I liked the movie and will probably see it at least 3x in the theatre.  It is eye candy with the black and white to full color memory, gorgeous sets and unbelievable costumes.  I have issues however with both the cinematography and the editing as far as the movie is concerned.  You can't do the movie half as a surreal dream and the rest of the memory scenes as realistic.  It just doesn't work.  There were times when I felt they should have cut to a different camera angle and once when we were staring up someones nostril for over 30 secs.  Distracting!As far as the actors, I LOVED everyone except the Phantom.  He hissed, he snarled, he growled and he sang that way as well-there was no vibratto to the voice.  In the first of the movie he just looked like a smooth psychopath in a mask, nothing different and I was sure he didn't have the range to carry the role.  Which makes a mental disconnect when the mask finally comes off and all of a sudden we discover that he has more than enough to explore the full depth of it. Almost as if he were being leashed with the mask on. It seems like artifice to me and it didn't work.The lack of vibratto is also distracting in Raoul and Christine's first songs.  For a while I wondered if it was just the lack of the big open theatre, but sure enough, this also shows up later in the film.  Again, a convention that didn't work for me.And while I read about this before seeing the movie, I really didn't think it would affect me as much as it did.  I truly believe it will blow the costuming Oscar for this film-but WHO IN THE WORLD decided to do Masquerade in tri-color?  As a historical backdrop, civilized society wore black and white to most functions, with the exception of a Masqued Ball, when it was open season.  On stage this was an unbelievable splash of color and much of the aria is given to talking about ""every mask a different shade, splash of gold, touch of puce, eye of blue....."" etc.  So that when the Phantom showed up in black and white and a mask, it is the ultimate irony because he is anything but civilized.  But in this film Masquerade the attendants are black, white and gold and the Phantom is the only color.  Again, WHY?And this is just a personal note of something that drove me nuts, but I have no idea why Christine Daae kept wondering around the theatre with Raoul in her underwear!  This is not the actions of a modest girl hoping to become a wife, but more in keeping with an Opera dancer auditioning for a different role.  At least Meg had on her tutu and corset cover, which is only semi-scandalous.As far as what I did like, Minnie Drive was Wonderful as Carlotta.  And I think I liked this Raoul better than Barton.  He had a youth and exuberence that he brought to the role which was enchanting.  A type of white knight quality of protector that is only found in the young.Again, I liked the film, but I can't figure out why certain choices where made.  They detracted from the film and kept it from being truly great."	4.0	Odd Choices	2005-01-03	5	1	4

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1E85KPLPYVW8E	"Kolors ""Jimmy"""	With only being slightly familiar with the story of The Phantom of the Opera, I really didn't know what to expect from it when my girlfriend dragged me the theater to watch it a while back. My first experience watching The Phantom of the Opera was an extremely confusing one. First of all, I have never actually sat down through an entire musical in my life. As sad as that may seem to some of you, musicals just aren't in my taste. So it was rather hard to follow the dialect in this film because 95% of it is singing. I was immediately turned off when I realized that most of this film was singing. I had no idea it was based on a musical play by some guy named Andrew Lloyd Webber. I guess I'm not cultured enough to have known that at the time. But anyways, secondly, I couldn't believe Joel Schumacher had directed it. I've known Schumacher for doing films like Falling Down, Flatliners, 8mm, Batman Forever, all really good films, but all out of the realm I believed The Phantom of the Opera to be in for a director of films of those nature. So not being a musical film fan and being terribly confused by the director, I had no way of telling if The Phantom of the Opera was a good movie or not. I really could not seem to figure out if I liked or not. It SEEMED like a musical that would have cultured play attending fools who listen to Beethoven and stuff like that jumping up and down in their seats. It SEEMED like it was a good movie, but I wasn't sure for myself. I felt like a blind person critiquing a painting. To me, at first, The Phantom of the Opera seemed like a contrived boring and annoying piece of movie, but I wasn't sure if that was because it was actually was like that, or if that's how all musicals are and I just don't have the stomach for them. I left the theater in a blunder and vowed not to put myself through that again and told myself I would take a neutral stand on my opinion of the Phantom film.But this weekend The Phantom of the Opera creeped into house and for some odd reason I felt so compelled to watch it after I told myself that I'd never watch it again. It was so strange watching it again, almost like I was watching it again for the first time, only better. The music I found so annoying and the singing that was so hard to understand in the beginning, I found myself able to follow the storyline better through the music and singing this time around. After a while, the music and singing didn't even seem like music or singing at all, I was following it just I would normal dialogue in any other movie. I felt emotionally connected to the characters. I really enjoyed the photography and the sets more. Everything in this movie seemed so rich to me now, it's really hard to tell what happened, but for some reason I had the ability to get into this movie. Maybe I had matured since I saw it (doubtful) or maybe this is just one of those movies you need to give a second chance. I think I was able to get in to The Phantom of the Opera the second time around because I knew what more to expect. I wasn't able to be disappointed because I knew what I was about to watch, and accepted it more the second time around for what it is, and not for what I wanted it to be. So is this a good musical? I don't know, your asking the wrong guy, but is it a good movie? I'm pretty sure it is.	4.0	Is this a good movie? I think so.	2005-05-10	2	1	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2GPEV42IO41CI	Kona	"It is the 1870s, and living beneath the Paris opera house is a mad, disfigured, musical genius known as the Phantom (Gerard Butler).  Using often violent methods, he advances the career of Christine, a young, orphaned chorus girl(Emmy Rossum). Christine is grateful to her mysterious mentor, but the Phantom wants more than her gratitude.I love the magnificent musical score and opulent sets and wardrobe; the film is a visual masterpiece.  The story is, at turns, passionate, dangerous, and tender, and is well-directed. At age 16, Rossum is sweet and innocent and gives a good performance as the conflicted Christine, but I felt the other two leads are miscast.  For me, Butler's lisp and overbite are too prominent and distracting (since the rest of his face is covered) and he lacks the confidence and charisma needed to pull off the role. Also, his eventual unmasking reveals nothing worthy of horror.  As Christine's childhood sweetheart, Patrick Wilson  has a American accent that makes it impossible to believe he's a French nobleman and I didn't find him appealing at all.Fans of the show may overlook these quibbles, however, as the production is first-rate in every other way.  Minnie Driver's performance as the  diva is one of the highlights.  If you're looking for lavish production values and a beautiful musical score, you'll enjoy this ""Phantom.""PS:  The Extras (the history of the musical, the filming of the movie, and a crew singalong) deserve 5 stars!"	4.0	"""Sing once again with me our strange duet..."""	2011-12-26	1	1	0

And it is quite ironic that all the comments that I hear from other people as I have left the theater are very positive, which is in opposition of most of the reviews of newspapers, magazines, and other movie reviewers.I am very impressed with Emmy Rossum, who plays Christine.  She has a beautiful voice!  Though I love listening to Sarah Brightman's version, Emmy adds more drama/feeling in her voice and her voice is quite clear and more youthful sounding which I believe is quite fitting for the part.Gerard Butler,in my opinion, is very dynamic as the Phantom.  He adds a lot of depth to the character which is seen in his body motions,his facial expressions,his eyes, and of course heard in his voice.  He has a rougher, more raw voice than Michael Crawford, but it is very expressive and lovely in his own way.  I really enjoy his voice.Raoul is an excellent singer himself.  He's an attractive guy, but if there is any fault in this movie it is that the Phantom is too beautiful.  Gerard Butler is a fine specimen, so it is hard for me to believe that Christine goes with Raoul and not with the...I'm gonna say it....sexy phantom.Minnie Driver also is great!  She plays the role of La Carlotta.  she's hilarious and provides comic relief for the film.The costumes and background provide a lot of visuals that aid in the beauty of the film, but I have to say that the actors, their performances, accompanied of course with the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber are the key to the greatness of this movie.All in all, this movie is very passionate and feeling.

Some reviewers put down her voice but after all she was supposed to be just what she is and she portrayed it beautifully. Of course her voice is light and sweet, she doesn't have the years of singing and straining to make it sound mature which would not be very fitting in her part. Patrick Wilson, however, is another story. His voice was weak and his acting was weak. Back to the phantom, his expression of his feelings in his voice could not have been better and is he ever a hunk. If I was Christine I would have let Raoul go and stayed with that gorgeous hunk of phantom. His eyes through the mask said so much and even without the mask he was sexy, sensual and a big WOW. The costumes were gorgeous, reminded me of the musicals of years ago that we no longer see. The story was funny in parts (Minnie Driver was superb), sad at times and brought tears to my eyes. I could and will watch it again and again. The soundtrack sounds wonderful in my car as I drive down the road and everyone around me can enjoy the Phantom of the Opera, (whether they want to or not) I can only say that since I've never seen the play, and I'm glad I haven't), I can't and don't want to compare it. I will let this movie stand on it's own and it can and do a good job of it.	5.0	What a wonderful, beautiful movie	2005-06-17	9	5	4

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2M614RD5MD1V2	Kristen	I've never seen the play version, so I have nothing to compare the movie version against, but I thought it was brilliantly done.  Cinematography, scores, etc were all great.  My only minor complaint is the fact that Emmy Rossum was cast as Christine.  Pretty girl, nice voice, decent actress, but I felt she was far too young to convey emotions appropriate for the film.  Plus the fact that her singing voice clearly isn't that of a trained opera singer took away from her singing parts.  Advanced pop singer, definitely, but opera singer, no way.  Gerard Butler doesn't have the best singing voice, but expresses such emotion and heartbreak that he led me almost to tears.As for the DVD, if you're interested in special features, I definitely recommend buying from Amazon.  I bought mine from Walmart, and there was only one disk inside with no special features at all; only the movie, scene selection, and subtitle option.	5.0	Fabulous movie	2005-05-06	6	3	3

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2RY3JWNMSREMD	Kristina	"I was very disappointed with this movie, even though I am a huge fan of Phantom of the Opera. Although I thought Webber did an honorable job of bringing this story from Broadway musical to live film, I think that they made the Phantom way too sexy. I mean, come on. The Phantom is not meant to be a sexy and attractive character. I really didn't care for Gerard Butler as the Phantom either. Do people really buy that this guy can sing? I also hate the Phantom's make up. It wasn't even scary! It wouldn't even have been frightening for people who had lived back in the 1800's, let alone today's society.I did, however, really like Emmy Rossum's performance as Christine Daee'. She had the role down flat. Emmy is very cute and has a great voice. She completely understood her charcter and how to deliver Christine Daee' onstage.Minnie Driver was very amusing as La Carlotta. I loved her wild costumes and she had some very good lines as well. I didn't really care for her new song ""Learn to be Lonely,"" which was only played during the credits, thank goodness. The song just didn't fit the original score by Webber and Rice.Miranda Richardson, who plays Madame Giry, was excellent. I love the back story that they came up with for Madam Giry and the Phantom. That answered a lot of questions for me. And whoever played Meg Giry was great as well. She's just very cute and makes a great Meg Giry.Patrick Wilson portrays the often-misunderstood Viscount de Changy. I thought that he did a marvellous job. Patrick and Emmy looked great beside each other and his voice really fit the character as well.Now, what I really love about the movie though is the artwork. The sets were stunning. I love how in the beginning everything was black and white, as though it was purposefully made to look like a bad home movie. Then, when the chandelier was brought up everything filled out with color and came back to life. That was definitely a great moment in the film in my book. The Phantom's labyrinth was also richly done and the Opera House is gorgeous.All in all, this wasn't a bad film. There are some moments that I loved and some additions that I thought totally worth seeing. I think in general most people will like it. I think I'm just picky. However, I did like it in the end."	3.0	Webber's Masterpiece Finally On Film	2005-02-08	7	3	4

Here's the scoop (And my background!): I was an English and Theater minor in college, I read Gaston LaRoux's original book, I saw Lloyd-Webber's musical many times, and I saw several different movie versions (Yes, even the one staring Freddy Kruger as the Phantom!).People, stop taking this movie so drastically seriously! It is a good movie. Fun to watch; I actually got teary eyed at the poor ""baby phantom"" in the circus cage. It is a plain old different story from the stage musical, movies, and book. The original stage version is different from the book: Erik was with his father in the book as a mason building the opera house; in the stage he sings of having a ""mask"" as his ""first unfeeling scrap of clothing.""Does that make the Musical hideous? Heck no! DRAMATIC license, people!People are complaining that it is not close enough to the Lloyd Webber stage version. Now, no one is Michael Crawford: he IS the Lloyd Webber version. But Gerry Butler is quite good as a younger, cuter, movie version that they created. I think they KNEW that they would never capture the magic that is on the stage 100% and made the movie a little ""different"" in order to make it satisfying. Perhaps the movie is even a bit more true to the Lloyd Webber score?People also complain that it is not closer to the book. Scarlett in ""Gone with the Wind"" had 3 kids, not 1 like the movie. Does that make it any worse? Nonsense! It's an OSCAR winner, for goodness sake.So here's the good things that should make you want to see the movie: It is a good story. It is casted well (Especially Emily Rossum who defines the word Ingenue!). The special effects are wonderful. The score is brilliant and beautiful.So, OPEN your mind to what it it, not what it was, and you will like it!Thanks for reading."	4.0	Open your mind; it's very good for what it is!	2005-04-22	7	6	1

The combination of actors/actresses with the drop dead gorgeous set, the fabulous music and every other aspect of this brilliant movie is just breath-taking. This is one of two movies that have made me shed a tear, the first being when I was eight and watching some cartoon. Emmy does a fantastic job at only sixteen years old. Patrick has a beautiful voice and is so dashing when he tries to save Christine, especially with a noose around his neck in the lair. Gerard, well, stole the show in my eyes. He adds a deeper emotion to the character of the Phantom. You can hear the desperation and assertiveness in his voice at all the right times. Gerard gives the Phantom a much needed edge to his voice that wasn't in Michael Crawford's phantom. Personally I prefer Gerard's version. Not to mention Gerard is also undeniably hot! They put together a fantastic cast with this movie. It is a must see! I absolutely loved it and watch it over and over!	5.0	Best Movie I've Ever Seen	2005-06-09	6	5	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1O30ZJ181B4JH	"Lady Blakeney ""bookworm221"""	"Set in Paris in the late 19th century, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" traces the relationship of the young opera singer Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum) and her mysterious mentor whom she calls her ""Angel of Music"". This angel turns out to be none other than the Phantom of the Opera (Gerard Butler), a disfigured musical genius who has been haunting the opera house for years, pestering the managers and the prima donna, Carlotta (Minnie Driver) and secretly falling in love with his student. When Christine's childhood sweetheart, Raoul (Patrick Wilson) shows up, the Phantom takes drastic measures to ensure that Christine will be his.The production features dazzling costumes and scenery. Strong performances are given by the cast, especially Patrick Wilson, Minnie Driver, and Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds (as the new managers, Mssrs. Andre and Firmin). Emmy Rossum, as the ingenue Christine, leaves much to be desired. Her voice is too underdeveloped to handle the role and she bounces between three different expressions thoughout the whole movie.The movie owes much to the performance of Gerard Butler, who faced heavy criticism while the movie was in release. In addition, far too much as been made of his attractive physical appearance. Both of these factors should be disregarded when watching this film. Prettiness aside, he is entirely believeable as a man who is consumed with self-loathing on one hand and total obsession on the other. His singing, though rougher than Michael Crawford's, nonetheless still charms and just adds to his decidedly unique portrayal. Viewers are treated to a bonus scene wherein Butler's Phantom sings of his loneliness and unrequited love that was trimmed from the actual movie."	4.0	Brilliant adaptation, beautiful story	2005-04-27	6	4	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AGGATUDK41H67	"LadyWriter ""catholicwriter23"""	I have Gaston Leroux's book and I read it before I even heard the soundtrack of the Original Broadway Cast with Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford.  When I first heard the soundtrack I had a few disappointments with the script, HOWEVER, as I listened to the music I decided some of the songs were very well done.I was estatic when it came out on film and disappointed so many people gave it such horrible reviews.  I decided to form my own opinion.  I went to the movie with my husband, with very few expectations.  My only expectations were:  enjoy the movie, and hear the songs I'd come to really enjoy.  I was in for a treat!Not only did it follow the book relatively well (with a few minor changes, nothing to get too worked up about) but they elaborated on the songs, they did a perfect rendition of the Phantom's lair, Christine was transfixed, quiet, pretty much terrified, which she was in the book.  The Phantom's voice was rougher, harsher and in general much more fierce than what I had heard of Michael Crawford's voice, which fit the personality of Erik better, as far as I was concerned.As to his face, in the 1800s any sort of deformaty was probably something to make people pause.  I think the make up was done well enough that it would be believable that people in that time period would be freaked out by it.  In fact, I was impressed by it.Sure, there's a few minor things one can say something about, but OVERALL the movie is great, pretty much keeps with what I remember of the book (Which I am re-reading to remind me of anything I'd forgotten).My best friend has seen the musical on stage and wants to go with me to see the movie.  She isn't worried about any small changes or mistakes, in fact she said in a lot of what I told her about the movie that it sounded cool.I think the best way to look at this movie is at the overall picture:  Does it convey the story properly, does it give the right idea?  Does it follow the book closely enough?  The answers to those questions (Every one) in my opinion is yes.  Maybe it was a little slow in a few parts, but that doesn't take away from the overal enjoyment.My advice is to form your own opinion, and go in with the expectation to enjoy yourself.	4.0	Good enough! :-)	2005-01-02	1	0	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AH6JFDSBJH2LN	"Lana ""The Angel of music"""	"Honestly, I think this film is a tragedy. It's an over hollywood-ized version which decided to sex up the story and focus on the beauty of the camera shots, hair and makeup, rather than the singing and acting ability. Not to mention, someone must have fallen asleep in the editing department.Gerard Butler's singing makes me cringe everytime I hear him sing. Same goes for Emmy Rossum. Although she would make a decent alto, she's no soprano. When she started off singing Think of Me, she blew too many notes to count. A good example of this, go listen to her ""Think of me waking..."" She scoops her notes and has a bad habit of lowering her range before attempting at the high notes. And not to mention, they lowered all of her songs because she couldn't hit the notes anyway.As for her display of emotion, she had exactly one expression on her face throughout the whole movie, and I can't say that I recall a single scene where her eyes aren't popping out and her mouth is actually CLOSED for God's sake!Even at the end when Raoul was being killed, she stood there with her mouth gaping open. Same goes for the cemetery scene. I was so tired of seeing the inside of her mouth in every scene from the movie.As for the editing, things irked me like Emmy's hair going down after the mirror scene, not to mention a load of black eyeshadow showing up. Her stockings also magically dissapeared? And things like stunt doubles (ie, look at the scene where 'Emmy' and Patrick are on the horse) being too obvious.All in all, I hate that this is even considered a version of the musical. I never got into it from the start. The camera never focusus on one person. During Think of Me, you'd assume the camera would need to be focused on Emmy, not wandering off elsewhere.Things like lyric cut outs, the date being pushed up, and the costumes being historically incorrect so they can merely show off more of Emmy's skin got to me too.I think Emmy ruined the whole movie, basically. She can't act to save her life. Nor can she sing up to the expectations of Sarah Brightman, Rebecca Caine, or any other stage Christine. I think this movie will give everyone a false impression. If people think THIS is emotional, then imagine what people would say once they see this on stage... And that of course, would be a million times more emotional, since the acting up there isn't as horrid.All in all, I know some die-hard movie fans out there will completely disagree. But some of the things I'm stating aren't my opinion. Christine NEEDS to be a soprano, and just because some people in this modern day and age have a problem with all the 'wobbling', 'vibrato', and 'high notes,' in real opera singing, doesn't mean that it had to change to please everyone. Sarah Brightman has the perfect voice for Christine, and Emmy doesn't. Imagine in the 1800s (Well, later than that, considering the movie bumped the date to make it more 'modern')an Opera diva such as Emmy goes on stage and starts singing. And keep in mind the Operas at the time. You'd have to be in a black box to hear her sing!And face it, the 'angel of music' with the heavenly voice, needs to actually be able to sing without choking on his notes and having few nasal problems in some areas. And basically, I don't care how much you love him, he's supposed to be a deformed psychopath in his 60s (even in the show), not some handsome 30 year old man with a deformation resembling a sun burn.Avoid this completely. Sure the beauty of the camera and special effects look great, but the emotion is just not there. Sadly, a lot of people will choose beauty and glamor over good acting and singing any day. So go ahead - like this movie. If you love it because it's as 'emotional' and 'touching' as so much of you claim it is, then maybe I'm the only one here who doesn't seem to agree.As I stated, Emmy Rossum's only display of emotion is opening her mouth and staring blankly into space. Very emotional, isn't it?"	2.0	Completely overblown and lacking in talent	2005-05-26	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2X3M0LWJX96VL	Laura Bellamy	"Admittedly, it's hard to have to see a film when you are so used to the stage show; one can't help comparing the two. In some ways, this film did wonderful justice to the famous stage show. In others, it could have done better.The LOOK of the film was fabulous, absolutely gorgeous beyond description. The costuming, the sets, all of it was beautiful. I was glad they kept the Andrew Lloyd Webber version of the Phantom's mask, only covering HALF the face, rather than the whole thing. But I was surprised at how non-repulsive the Phantom actually WAS. He's supposed to have these ghastly hideous features, but he really wasn't that bad, his scars were minor and not monstrous at all. It was a little anti-climactic. The Phantom himself was a little too attractive, too sexy, which was a little weird.I don't mind so much that Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford did not play in this film. However, I think that the voices they had were not as good as they could have found. The Phantom had a decent voice, but it wasn't dark like it should have been. Christine seemed to have some trouble reaching some of the higher notes, and her voice was simply too weak to be convincing as an opera singer. It was a nice voice, sweet and pretty, but unsupported, a voice that would never carry in an opera house. And while I didn't necessarily mind Minnie Driver's role as the prima donna, it didn't make any sense to have her play the part in the first place --- especially since she didn't even do her own singing. This is a popular enough show that it doesn't NEED a big name just for the sake of having a big name in the film. That almost seems to show a lack of faith in their own work, if they have to feature someone well-known to get people interested in seeing it. They should have used the person who actually did the singing voice.At least most of the music was in there. I was worried they would cut a lot of the good songs, but they kept it all in there, and most of it was pretty well-done, even if the voices COULD have been stronger.The most annoying thing for me, though, was the random flashes into the ""present,"" the black-and-white segments. The beginning and the end is fine, it's appropriate. But having them interspersed through the rest of the film was really distracting, and unnecessary. It brought the audience out of the real action of the story and didn't add anything to the plot. Didn't make sense.I certainly enjoyed the film, and it had a lot of good things about it. But I think they could have done a better job than they did. The next time I see ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" it will be on the stage."	3.0	Mixed Feelings	2005-07-08	4	3	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AX2A8Q454K8L2	Laura	"I have always been a fan of the Phantom of the Opera and have listened to the CDs more times than I care to admit. When I heard that they were making the play into a movie, I have to admit that I was skeptical. After seeing the movie, my weariness has drastically changed. This movie takes the essence of the songs and transforms it beautifully onto the big screen. I do have a few specific points that I would like to comment on.Many reviewers have commented on Gerard Butler not being fit for the role of Phantom. Yes, he does have a deeper voice than Michael Crawford. I personally feel that it adds to the Phantom's mysteriousness and sensuality. He has a wonderful voice. If you need further convincing listen to him sing Music of the Night. No, he is not Michael Crawford . . . but would you all really want to see an older, weighty Phantom drooling over a youthful Christine??? He also is a wonderful actor. He brings a different light to the dark Phantom's character. Audiences pity, love and lust for him. He represents the dark desires that you only dream about and never speak of. Yet, amidst all of this he is a murderer. He balances it all out beautifully and has an amazing voice. Stop comparing him to Michael Crawford and you'll see it too.The character of Christine has also been criticized for being too young. Christine is supposed to be a mere chorus girl and ballet student. It wouldn't be right to have someone in their twenties pretending to be that young as other films have tried. Emmy Rossum also makes Christine a much fuller character. In the play, I thought Christine was a wishy-washy character who couldn't make a decision if her life depended on it. Now you can see how she is drawn to both men and truly does love them both. You can also understand why she trusts the Phantom so much. It's not because she's incapable, she believes all along it's her father's ghost. What girl wouldn't trust her father???The last person that is quite regularly criticized is Minnie Driver. No, she is not the voice of Carlotta. Did you expect her to be able to hit those notes because she felt like it? It takes a lot of professional training to do that. Minnie Driver does however have a good deal of training in acting which a professional vocalist would not. The character of Carlotta is a lot of the comic relief in this dark film. Minnie Driver manages to make audiences laugh without going ""over the top."" She is perfect for the role and brings out her character perfectly. I never used to like the song Prima Donna before. Now I listen to it #1 for the singing and #2 for the acting that is associated with the song. I don't think that the dubbed voice is such a bad thing. I'm sure all of the reviewers would have something to say if they heard Minnie Driver trying to hit those notes.Overall I think the film is wonderful. It's wonderfully acted and need I comment on Patrick Wilson's voice. Wow! The movie takes all of the wonderful things from the play and adapts it for the screen better than I thought possible. Michael Crawford was bound to get too old for the role. When you go see the play now, it's not going to be Michael Crawford playing the Phantom anymore.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AF29TNM0A9PYK	"Laura Lea May ""Beauty sleeps deep within the ..."	I had never seen the play, only heard the music, and when i heard they made this into a film i was extremely excited.  I think that Micheal Crawford is a great Phantom, so before I get flamed let me state my reasons for liking the film so much.Visually, I don't think there are some things that could be done on stage that can be done in the film.  And on that note, let me say that Joel Shumaker is a great dark director.  Now, I can go into my review.Gerard Butler is an underestimated actor as it is, but when I saw him playing the Phantom I was immersed completely in the film.  The music, the actors, no matter how raw were amazing.  I think Gerard brought sensuality and passion to the phantom that just from the voice I can't hear with Micheal Crawford.  Emmy Rossum was closer to the age of Christine than Sarah Brightman was, which makes it even better in my opnion.  When the ages all match up for the role, when you haven't had too much in the way of experience, it fits so much better for the role of Christine.I can't even begin to sum up all of my favorite parts of the film, that would take too long, but I loved the opening scene, when it fades from black and white to color, I get chills every time I see it, and I have seen it twice, I plan to go see it more once it opens in my city so I dont have to drive 30 miles away to see it.  But let me just say that it is amazing...Beautiful and Dark, Passionate and Sexual, the voices are perfect...Past the Point of No Return is one of the most moving songs in the whole movie...When the two of them are entwined on the plank aboive the fire, their chemistry is out of this world.  I give it 10/10, WOW!  Go see it, you may like it or hate it, but I think it will grow on you.	5.0	Unexpected Splendor	2005-01-06	1	1	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A15YY6F4SI6V	"Laura S. Dallam ""laurashelby64"""	I had seen the movie years ago and loved it.  Then just recently saw the stage show in NYC and really do love them both.  Just ordered this special edition and look forward to the extra stuff. I think maybe I'm in the minority, but I really enjoy both versions of the Phantom.  I've had the original London soundtrack for a long time and to be honest, I like Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum's voices better (I know....the minority again!).  I think Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford have beautiful voices, but sometimes found Brightman's a little too high pitched (maybe operatic?) for me and the same for Crawford.  For me, Butler's raspy voice was more what I would picture the Phantom to sound like and I found it a little easier to hear Emmy Rossum's words more clearly.  Minnie Driver was hilarous, although a bit much at times...I was sorry that she wasn't able to sing as I know she can..but I guess the soprano voice is hard if you're not practiced in it.  Miranda Richardson and Jennifer Ellison were great as Madame Giry and Meg.  I suppose the only disappointment was Patrick Wilson's Raoul.  He's certainly handsome and has gorgeous eyes, but I don't think the long hair was a good choice.  He does have a beautiful voice though. To sum it up, I really enjoyed this movie and will watch it many times in the future.	5.0	Loved it and the stage version as well	2010-10-07	0	0	0

Just as the last scene faded out, there was a moment of silence, then a wave of clapping and cheering! That's how wonderful Phantom of the Opera is. Not since Gone With The Wind or The Wizard of Oz has a movie this fantastic been made. It makes all other movies seem like sitcom TV. There are so many details such as the performances, the costumes, the scenery, the artistic direction, etc... that I couldn't possibly cover every wonderful thing. Every actor gives a stellar performance, from the spine tingling voices of the leads to the comic relief of the orchestra's director, the opera owners, Minnie Driver and the cleaning ladies. The artistic direction of fading from black and white scenes to the breathtaking full color scenery is very imaginative. Phantom is my all time favorite stage production. I have seen it 4 times so I was leary of what Hollywood types would do to ""jazz it up"" or how they would try to change Weber's music that is so moving. Well, with today's killer surround sounds, the music was the best I've ever heard. If this movie does not make you a Phantom fan, then there's no hope for you. If it doesn't win every single category at the Academies then they should cancel the awards because no other film of the year, or of the century compares to this film. By the way, I have never written a review of movie like this before, but this movie thrilled me so much that I wanted everyone to see it."	5.0	Standing ovation	2004-12-23	4	4	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A19WRXQ7EG8QF5	"L. Carol ""carolcecilia, D.V."""	"I have been looking forward to viewing the DVD to one of best movies I have seen in 2005. What sets this DVD apart is that its recordings are very, very well executed, even when played on my low fidelity system. Having the full subtitles to the lyrics is also fantastic for singing along and to relive a truly cathartic experience. Having said that, the bonus materials/making-of featurettes were, while informative, a bit of a 'cheat' as the producers decided to pay greater tribute to the original cast (of the London West End Musical) than the latest trio of Butler/Rossum/Wilson. Another disappointment was the lack of deleted scenes except for a Gerard Butler solo of ""Learn To Be Lonely"", the same song performed by Minnie Driver in the closing credits.As to the movie itself, I was skeptical as to how much value a movie rendition of one of my all-time favorite musicals could add. To my utter delight and astonishment, I walked out of the theatre unduly satisfied, rating the movie more highly than the musical. I had the opportunity of seeing ""Phantom"" on stage three times, once when I was still a poor student and was seated at the upper balcony, and later in life in the most pricey seats located in the Grand Stall and Dress Circle. Yet, none of these expensive seats offered the superior vantage points the movie could bring. The experience was synonymous to being given the best seats at any one moment in time in full view of the goings-on (no need for binoculars for a change!), allowing viewers to take in the immediacy of the hustle and bustle, songs and dances, romantic love triangle et al!Obviously, for the truly nitpicking, technicality like the leading cast's singing was perhaps, for the lack of a better word, ""sub-par"" to the renown vocal ranges of the original duo (Michael Crawford/Sarah Brightman). But it is unduly unfair to write-off the movie solely on account of this. The acting was moving and the rare occurrence of perfect on-screen chemistry between Emmy Rossum as sweet Christine and Gerard Bulter* as the enigmatic Phantom was a cinematic gem. Viewers are likely to welcome a meatier and more compassionate role donned by Miranda Richardson's Madame Giry, not least the casting of bitchy Carlotta. I was puzzled at first given that Minnie Driver was the only thespian in the cast whose singing voice was fully dubbed until the closing credits. However, my doubts were cleared as soon as I saw Driver's purposely over-the-top yet wonderfully show-stealing performance, not least giving viewers the acute impression of her enjoying every minute of enlivening her limited screen time!Having perused the scope of the movie, it became obvious why Andrew Lloyd Webber decided to make a movie extravaganza of the musical with Joel Schumacher since 1991. It was excellent direction and collaboration at that. The movie was never meant to be an inferior re-make of the musical, but one whose aim was to improve on the stage-play with a more thoroughly fleshed out screenplay amidst the plethora of action, weightier characterization of the supporting roles, not least greater substantiation of the many assumed knowledge unbeknownest to viewers in light of stage limitations, complete with lavish sets, costumes and cinemaphotography to sweep viewers off their feet!The movie worked as a great supplement and a must-see for fans of the musical, not to mention those, like myself, who have not had a chance to read the original novel by Gaston Leroux. The additional developments in the movie were already worth the price of the ticket - some 15 minutes of newly-written music backing scenes absent in the musical! I won't be a killjoy by revealing the unnecessary, but here's a teaser: what about how Phantom came to be? I was also impressed by the amount of labor and toil that went into making this movie far more visually gratifying than the musical. Webber/Schumacher & Co even managed to outdo the already vibrant set/costumes' design in the musical's ""Masquerade"" Act, accomplishing this feat by repackaging the scene in a glittery monochromatic affair, refreshingly adorning the costumes/sets in just black/white/gold/silver, except to single out Christine in her virginal pink outfit and Phantom in his killer red attire!And if the afore-mentioned didn't quite convince you to give the show a chance despite lukewarm reviews from critics, here's one to whet your appetite: while the musical never gave any concluding remarks as to what happened to Phantom, Christine and Raoul after they escaped from the underground labybrinth of the Paris Opera House, the movie provided a satisfactory wrap of the following: (i) if Christine & Raoul lived happily ever after and (ii) what became of Phantom following his mysterious disappearing act from the dark labyrinth of Opera Populaire - this epilogue alone was good enough justification to watch the movie.*As an aside: Seeing Gerard Butler's interview clips on the DVD reaffirms why this under-rated, latecomer to Hollywood is a rare breed and quickly gaining a following - what a great display of humility! Despite his not unsuccessful stint with a Scottish rock band, he humbly conveyed he had so much to learn from veteran singers like Rossum (trained to sing since age 7) and Patrick Wilson (a critically acclaimed broadway singer) and that he slogged really hard to tackle the huge singing part of Phantom. I look forward to catching more of Gerry Bulter in future...hopefully to see him succeed Pierce Brosnan in the much contested title role in the new James Bond series."	5.0	Great DVD to accompany this movie-musical extraordinaire!	2005-07-01	9	8	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A35Y8C2OZ0NJZ	Lee Craig Hauenstein	Its very hard to begin a review without going off in a rant about all the things that are displeasing about this movie. As far as die hard phans are concerned one must be warned to keep an open mind. for people never before exposed to the wonders that are the Phantom of the Opera it could be considered a good starting point.There are many different versions of the Phantom's tale and the most popular is the Andrew Lloyd Webber version. This movie casting form the older more maniacal version of the Phantom was deliberately changed by ALW himself wanting a younger version that audiences could relate unfortunately his pick although pleasing to the eye did not do his own version as well. Instead of using the dark seductive voice we know Gerard Butler possesses it is suspect you spent hours listening to the original cast recording to adapt the poor rendition of the Michael Crawford portrayal he used.I can not say there where come moment in the film where we did not see his natural voice prevail and give us a glimpse of what might have been. The scene in the underground lair where the mask is ripped from his face and he rants it truly wonderful. while others sung this part Gerard growled ranted and stormed about like a man possessed making him sound very much like he should. In a few moments usually his breaking down he drops in tones and whispers another glimpse of the path he should have taken. This is especially evident when he is singing The Point of No Return. A very moving piece and probably the only tolerable one in the movie Masquerade taking a close second.The cast of secondary characters made the movie enjoyable Minnie Driver leading the way. although she did not sing her own parts she filled the role to all of it qualifications as if she had been truly singing. I myself have always despised Raoul and many phans will agree with this view point for he is the bane of the Phantoms happiness. In this movie I absolutely adored him, the actor had stage presence and his voice was gentle and powerful, simple gesture on his part said more then many of the spoken lines other character failed to achieve the emotion behind them. Meg and Madame Girl were also lovely although Madame Girl seemed a tad stiff in her role perhaps a bit childish at times.Overall the casting was lovely and worth watching until Christine's first aria. When Emmy Rossem first appeared on screen she defiantly had the right look and handled herself very well. The main problem was she kept the same look throughout the movie. She looked dazed and in a trance, glassy eyes a slightly parted mouth. It seemed the makeup artist tried to cover up the look by giving her a smoky eye look not suited for the girl face but only succeed in drawing more attention to to eyes. Her vocals leave a lot to be desired for as well, she has some experience participating in an opera chorus in her younger years. While one can tell the soundtrack was tweaked in production she has feature she can not hide a very bad squeak when she slides from note to not usually during a huge change from high to low and vice versa.The music all seems a bit toned down the overture lacking the power behind the organs but the visual was quite stunning. The biggest disappointment aside from Christine was the Phantom's deformity. Commented and agreed upon my man phans as nothing more then a bad sunburn or burn from a fire, Mr. Kevin Spacey was more disfigured by his burns in Pay It Foreward.Perhaps it was censored as not to frighten small children a sad fact to please the masses. My recommendation for this film is perhaps rent it or wait for it to televised. If you do find yourself watching this film try watching it in French for the story of the Phantom originated in France and the French dubbing is lovely Christine actually sounds as she should.	1.0	The Corruption of Hollywood	2005-12-27	14	3	11

Just one warning, though.  Try not to compare their voices too closely to the original cast.  That's the mistake I made when I saw this in the theater and no, they're not as good.  But, now that I've seen it again on DVD, I've realized that taken on their own, their voices aren't particularly bad.  In fact, there were times, like on ""The Point of No Return"" where I thought Gerard Butler actually did a better job of conveying the emotion in his voice.  They both did a great job on that scene, better than I've ever seen it done on stage."	5.0	I loved the play and I love the movie too	2005-06-15	3	1	2

Schumacher's crew and cast did an outstanding job bringing this Gothic masterpiece to film. Gerard Butler is a great Phantom - sexy, menacing, and he can sing. Yes, he sings in a deeper baritone and is no Michael Crawford. But Gerard wasn't trying to be as he's not a professional singer. I love Michael Crawford, but prefer Gerard's deeper rougher vocals especially on ""Music of the Night.""  Obviously, we all would have loved to see Brightman and Crawford reunited on film.  That would have been sheer perfection.  However, it wasn't meant to be. Now Emmy Rossum is delightful. Her singing is exquisite and that voice is simply lovely to hear. There is definite chemistry between Rossum and Butler. I like Patrick Wilson whom sings beautifully, but his acting is rather stilted. I wonder if Schumacher could have coaxed more from him. Minnie Driver is hilarious and over the top as the opera diva. I loved her. Miranda Richardson is a fantastic bonus to any film. The production and costumes are lavish, and the musical score is fabulous. Highly recommend!"	5.0	A lavish and wonderful musical	2011-12-29	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1NRSMAGI79LLJ	"Les Johnst ""LJJ"""	OK, so Gerard Butler can't sing as well as opera-trained Emily Rosum or theatrically and musically trained Patrick Wilson. But he actually does a credible job of singing - more like a rock star, but he has power behind his sustained notes and can hit the sweet falsettos to give his character tenderness and vulnerability. He also conveys the powerful allure of the phantom, especially when he replaces the lead in Don Juan Triumphant. Gerard Butler was a virtual unknown when he played the lead in this movie.Emily Rosum and Patrick Wilson sound amazing together. Until watching this, I never knew that Patrick Wilson was an accomplished vocalist. The story is fairly faithful to the book but the music is haunting. Acting is good too, for a &#34;rock&#34; opera, but it just got under my skin. Minnie Driver is a comic element in the story (she plays the less-talented diva, Carlotta). I laughed when she was saying &#34;He lova me, he lova me&#34; in her affected flat voice after meeting patron, Patrick Wilson.	5.0	Not for everyone but it totally captivated me!	2013-06-23	0	0	0

The cinematography was amazing from beginning to end. Emmy Rossm is an excellent Christine. I read the book, seen this movie twice and have seen the play on Broadway twice. I noted that one reviewer called the movie disappointing. They made some comments about the Phantoms final unveiling and how it was inconsistent. Well they failed to note that the Phantom wore a wig which is why his hair appeared different in color and texture when unveiled. It's a great movie. I will admit there are minor inconsistencies but overall it is wonderful. Anyone who loved the play will love the movie. It fills in some of the gaps that the play left out.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ATCUUQYLUSL9Q	L. E. WANG	I've seen the stage version and enjoyed it, but the movie version made the stage version complete, more romantic and beautiful. I actually understood the plot better in the film version. It stays 98% true to the stage version. You get to see a more passionate and hot looking Phantom. I am in love with Gerard Butler because of this film. Michael Crawford is a great singer, but his Phantom lacks the depth of sorrow and pain (and even sex appeal) that was superbly portrayed by Gerard Butler. (Even Butler cried over the Phantom's loneliness - the director mentions that in the 2-disc special.) Emmy Rossum as Christine is perfect. My only complaint is Raoul. Great voice, but he could've been played by a cuter actor. (Then again, that could've taken the attention away from the hot looking Phantom.)  Maybe Raoul's hair could've been done better? Gerard Butler may not have that polished voice (because he's not a real singer), but his passion as the Phantom is completely there!I am so glad the director decided to make this a young cast because it made so much more sense that Christine Daae is a young and naive teenager (Emmy Rossum was 16 when she worked on this film) who thought this man lurking in the shadows at night was some Angel of Music sent by her father. If it was a middle-aged Sarah Brightman, then you'd think this lady is loon.The 2-disc version with special features is a must for all Phantom fans. You get to see the behind the scenes story. I just wish they would have commentary over the film by the director and maybe some of the actors. Maybe in an anniversary edition can add that, but it sucks that you'd have to buy another copy just to hear commentaries.You will fall in love with this movie!!	5.0	Beautiful film!	2010-07-12	3	3	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A10H8BHFFD8H0C	Lexifan	"I thoughly enjoyed the romantic film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Phantom of the Opera"" both for its lavish sets and stunning visual moments which are best experienced in a theater with digital sound.  Just the opening scene with the transition of the chandelier is worth the ticket price.  I am an unabashedly musical lover and the soaring notes in the ""Phantom"" have always been one of the my favorites which undoubtedly influence my opinion somewhat.  Though different from the stage version the film throws some emotional punches as epitomizied by the acting chops of Gerard Butler who I felt portrayed a sensitive and riveting Phantom.  Singing comparisons aside, the film moved me and delivers in visual ways that the stage version does not therefore stands in its own merit.  SEE IT WITH AN OPEN HEART AND ENJOY!"	5.0	Highly recommended for all musical lovers	2005-01-12	2	1	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AT8VN6KB82WWF	"Leyla ""sierra_gold_"""	I will not include what the movie is about but I will include my opinion of the movie. I'm 35 and my tastes in movies may differ from the younger generation.Some people may say the play is better. But then you must realize the play is limited to singing and acting but lacks the magical aspect that is shown on the big screen. Modernized by the latest movie technology, this version is the best one yet. With stunning morphing scences at the beginning of the movie you will be hooked. In this movie the music is oprea style of course. But now it's mixed with rock which gives it a new aspect. With both Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber helping with the movie. I don't think anyone else could do a better job.-Side note- Now I was totally surprised on learning that Gerald Butler played as the Phantom. (From Laura Croft Cradle of Life.) And had no idea that he was able to sing. But I felt he did well as the phantom.I watched the version from 1991 with Burt Lancaster as the father (of the phantom) and theater owner. What I didn't like was the Phantom being fatally wounded by police.If you trully have a taste for all kinds of music. I trully hope you will enjoy this movie like I did. To me I think this movie surpassed all the movies I have ever seen including my favorites.	5.0	If you love musical's you will love this movie.	2005-05-29	1	0	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A9AY4W070DBHX	L. Gabbard	I am a latecomer to the Phantom, I did my best to ignore it from its' debut on. However, I decided to do something nice and take my mother and fiance to a stage production of the Phantom in April. I was in love within the first 20 minutes. By the end of Act 1 I already wanted to see it again! I took a chance and bought the full screen DVD edition and watched it with the same two people. It's fairly faithful to the stage production. Of course, film allows for much editing and more elaborate sets, but it didn't bother us. What did bother us was Gerard Butler's singing. It wasn't the same quality as the other principals in the movie, and nowhere close to anyone who has done the Phantom onstage. It was bearable, and we got used to it. I definitely will watch it again, while waiting to see a stage production of the Phantom of the Opera again someday.	4.0	Very nice.	2010-06-06	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AFOK05KDCHSHL	Libretio	THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA(UK/USA - 2004 - color & sepia)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSFrance, 1870: The Paris Opera House is haunted by a mysterious figure (Gerard Butler) who tutors a young opera ing&eacute;nue (Emmy Rossum) and becomes enraged when she falls in love with a handsome nobleman (Patrick Wilson).Joel Schumacher's long-planned adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ultra-successful stage musical opens with the greatest set-piece of this director's career: A spine-tingling shift from grainy monochrome to saturated color as the timeframe switches from 1919 to 1870, restoring the dilapidated Opera House to its former glory in a swirl of visual effects trickery. It's a powerful moment, one which encapsulates the very essence of this venerable cinematic warhorse. What follows is every bit as sumptuous as the stage show, with a younger cast in familiar roles: Newcomer Rossum is an angelic Christine, beautiful and talented in equal measure, while Wilson shines as her lovestruck admirer, whose dalliance with Christine invites the Phantom's wrath, played with strength and conviction by Butler. Simon Callow and Ciar&aacute;n Hinds provide comic relief as the Opera's new owners, and there's strong support from Miranda Richardson (the Opera's ballet mistress, bound to the Phantom by more than mere coincidence), Minnie Driver (generously eccentric as the obstinate diva whose monstrous ego and limited talent prove to be her undoing), and veteran Murray Melvin as the frazzled orchestra conductor (a sublime, near-wordless performance).The film is a spectacle in all senses of the word, designed and photographed to glorious cinematic excess. Webber and Schumacher financed the production independently, so the finished product is true to their respective vision, but while the results are a feast for the senses, it's also compromised in unusual ways: Except for the chandelier sequence and an earlier scene in which the Phantom murders a nosy stagehand (Kevin McNally), Schumacher de-emphasizes the horrific elements of Gaston Leroux's original novel in favor of Gothic visuals (note the Cocteau homage during Christine's first visit to the Phantom's subterranean lair), and he's too quick to reveal the Phantom as a flesh-and-blood creature without any supernatural trappings, which undermines his potency. Those unfamiliar with the stage show may also bristle at the amount of dialogue which is SUNG rather than spoken, draining several crucial scenes of their dramatic urgency, especially during the film's final stretch, though the climactic pay-off is genuinely heartfelt. Romantic, resplendent, defiantly old-fashioned, this 'Phantom' overcomes its minor obstacles to emerge as a triumph in every department.	3.0	Visually stunning adaptation of the old literary warhorse	2009-10-28	4	3	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1GKKZ62D9DVB8	Ligniere	All I can say is WOW!!  What a movie.  I loved it.  I, too, was skeptical about Butler...at first.  Then I heard the soundtrack.  He's great.  And then I saw the movie.  He is not great, he's perfect.  He has so much passion for the role, and it shows.  He is a 'young, sexy Phantom.'  I was also skeptical about that idea when I first heard it.  But I changed my mind.  A young, sexy Phantom.  NICE!!!  He can take me to his lair anytime!  I am a huge Michael Crawford fan (he is my favorite singer) and wanted him to reprise the role.  Now I don't.  Butler holds his own, and gives an excellent performance.Emmy Rossum is a beautiful Christine, and her singing is amazing!  Patrick Wilson is so dashing and handsome; and he sings too!  The orchestrations are rich and intense; just like the movie.  A lavish performance.  Lloyd Webber delievers another wonderful production.  My favorite movie was 'Evita;' that has been knocked from the top spot.  It is now occupied by 'The Phantom of the Opera.'  This is a must-see for all Lloyd Webber nuts like me.  You WON'T be disappointed.	5.0	Let the dream begin...	2004-12-23	4	4	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1KG40NSOR5FGM	lilith	I could have seen this film when it's still in theatre. I could have seen this film when it first came out on DVD a couple of years ago. I SHOULD have seen this film when it's still in circle that my opinion could make any different. In stead, I've seen it for the first time LAST MONTH and if I hadn't come across a few scenes of this movie from youtube I wouldn't even have a wit to check it out. I, an avid fan of the book, an even bigger fan of the musical, intentionally ignored the most satisfying film version that based directly on my favourite story for 3 years thanks to my stubbornness and stuck-up-ness.Like most of the phanatics I was overexcited when I knew they're going to make a film version of ALW's musical masterpiece. And like most of the phanatics I was super-upset when I found out that neither the original casts nor any professional opera singers had been chosen to take the iconic roles. Unlike many of the phanatics I didn't even go to see the movie with my own eyes to make my own judgement. Instead I read the not-so-good reviews from the critics (whose words I'd never paid attention to, up until then) and the bashings from general fans of the stage version and the book and chose to BELIEVE them.Then one day God took pity on me and made me come across the final lair scenes from youtube while searching for something else, it's the first time I'd ever seen any scenes from this movie, and I was hooked. A few more clips, a short trip to a VDO renting shop and a couple hours later I've become one the biggest fan of the film and one of the biggest fool for taking this long to realise that.My initial expectation can go to hell, this film was made the way it's intended to be, the way it meant to be and, to those who 'get' it, the way it should be. Leroux's fans should accept the fact that this film is an adaptation of the musical, not the book.Gerard Butler's singing is technically no comparison to Michael Crawford's but his raw and powerful voice conveys all the passion and intensity his role required. He made his singing the part of his acting. He might not sound like an angel but he definitely sounds like THE Phantom. The fact that with the mask on he looks hot enough to roast a turkey is a bonus.Emmy Rossum is no Sarah Brightman and yet she's the perfect Christine for the film version. She wasn't made to be an opera singer. However, for general audience her voice is a lot easier to digest than Sarah's voice and her acting is faultless. Patrick Wilson is the best classical singer among the leading roles and very convincing as the charming Raoul.A lot of people aren't happy with the Phantom's (lack of) deformity. BIG DEAL! He IS deformed, full stop. Does he have to look as hideous as possible to get your vote? There're so many horror film versions of POTO out there where they made the Phantom more terrifying, more evil than he's supposed to be. Why can't we accept the film that made him more human?Well, it's a bit pointless to write this review, isn't it? People who love it've been already a fan and those who hate it aren't likely to change there opinions anytime soon. But in case someone need my opinion, I recommend this to anyone who love musicals, new to the story, never seen the stage shows or those who have but are open to accept the differences. Fans of the book won't like it though as it plays down on the mystery & horror angle and emphasized on the romantic & drama side.The two discs version has the song `No one would listen', the deleted scenes which could have been one of the film's highlights if it hadn't been cut.	5.0	How could I miss this???	2008-01-24	2	2	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3MH2504HEST7P	lilsisasu	Have you wanted to see The Phantom of the Opera on stage, but can't afford a ticket to see it or don't live near New York City, London, or Las Vegas and can't afford a trip to any of them?  Well, let me say, as someone who was lucky enough to see it when it was still on tour, that this movie is a great substitute for you.  It is just as good as the show itself.  Now, I'll admit that there is nothing like seeing a musical on stage, but not everybody can afford to go see one.  So when I watched this movie for the first time recently, I was kind of skeptical about watching it.  However, when I watched it, I fell in love with it.  It was almost exactly like the stage production.  I think that it stayed so close to the musical because Andrew Lloyd Webber supervised the making of the movie.  You can always tell when a musical movie has been made without the original composer's supervision.  They are usually horrible.  Thankfully, ALW  was involved in the whole process.Okay, on to my thoughts about the movie.  Well, let me say, the acting choices were superb!  Emmy Rossum really showed the innocence of Christine.  She is an excellent singer as well.  I was not surprised that she had sung in the Metropolitan Opera as a young child after hearing her sing. Gerard Butler did such a great job as the Phantom.  He gave the Phantom a kind of rock and roll feel.  I didn't know that he could sing.  Now, I'll admit, he was not as good a singer as some of the stage actors who have played him, but for someone who had only sung in a rock band, he did a really good job.  He really showed the dark quality that draws women to the Phantom.  Patrick Wilson did an excellent job as Raoul.  I could honestly see him playing Raoul on the stage.  I had never heard of him until watching this and so I wasn't surprised when I found out that he had been in musical theater before.  It seems like that would be such a natural thing for him to do.  Now, even though I gave this movie 5 stars, I really feel like it deserved 4 1/2 stars instead.  I think they could have gotten better actors to play Andre and Firmin.  Also, I didn't really like the lyric changes so much.  I guess I've heard the OLC recording so much that it sounds weird to hear different lyrics.  Other than those two things, I recommend that everyone buy this movie!  You will not be disappointed.	5.0	Good Substitute if you can't afford to go see the live show	2011-03-29	0	0	0

Gerard Butler was amazing.  Perhaps his voice was not as refined as Michael Crawford's, but it suited the passion,despair, and  anger of his Phantom beautifully. My only real complaint was Minnie Driver's Carlotta.  A bit too over the top but not enough to take away a star.  Will be watching this again and again.  Enjoy!	5.0	Spectacular!	2014-03-18	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1JG9R39UQI4L4	"Linda Martin ""Linda Martin"""	The casting was perfect - the main players were all believable, and attractive except for the wicked, wretched phantom of course (Gerard Butler) who was never meant to be attractive in any way. The leading lady, Christine (Emmy Rossum) was gorgeous in an odd but highly appealing sort of way, and her boyfriend Raoul (Patrick Wilson) was adorable.There was a lot of music, more than we normally like to hear during a film. But it was an opera movie, so what would you expect? The songs were fantastic, easy to understand, and beautifully performed. It could make someone start to like opera if, for some reason, they didn't already.What I liked best of all in this movie were the sets and costumes. They were unbelievably beautiful. The dresses - oh my goodness - they were incredibly detailed and I would have loved to wear things like that when I was younger. And the old Paris opera house was amazing. In the first scene the opera house was old and abandoned, and the site of an auction in 1919. But then the movie flashed back to 1870 where the main action of the story takes place in the grandeur and luxury of the most wonderfully gorgeous theater you could imagine. This is really worth seeing just to look at the architecture.So there you have my opinions. If you haven't seen it and don't care for musicals - especially those with lots of opera singing, you still might want to check it out if you like costumes, gracious old buildings, and intense love triangle stories that will stay in your mind for years to come.	5.0	Dazzling, eye-catching beauty	2007-03-01	3	3	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A17BNPZU732R7Q	Linda Maxin	When this movie first came out in DVD, I had no intention of buying it much less watching it.  Just wasn't interested and was not familiar with the opera and story.  Then a friend strongly suggested I see this, which I promptly did.  The story, music and singing completely took my breath away!  I was hooked and wanted more!  Needless to say, I did buy the DVD, but was disappointed there were no extra features.  This mainly was because every single time I watched Phantom, (and we're past a dozen times now!), I was dying for inside looks into the characters from the actors etc.  I didn't realize until later that sometimes special features are released much later after the movie comes out.So lo and behold, I was escstatic when I ran across the the 2-disc special edition, which I promptly bought.  For just a few dollars more than the movie, this special edition delivers well and beyond all expectation! It's over three hours.  The first half explains how the Phantom was even brought to Broadway.  It's extremely interesting and very insightful.  The second half is the actual behind the scenes documentary on how the movie was made, the challenges they had (which were tremendous), why they chose the actors they did, insight into the characters, how they did the crashing chandelier, (fascinating), and my favorite, the sing-a-long with the crew of the main theme-what a hoot!!!If this sounds up your alley, you will love this!!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1KRH11M1I518A	LindaSue	I didn't even want to go initially to this movie.  I had seen the stage production of Phantom in San Francisco 5 years ago and hated it.  I didn't get the story, the acting was okay, the singing was operatic.  I thought I was going to a musical, not an opera.  My daughter is the Phantom fan, when she begged me to go with her I went.I was aboslutely stunned!  The movie made the story so much more real to me than the stage version.  I finally 'got it'.  I have now seen this movie 9 times and counting.  Gerard Butler is perfect as the Phantom.  He is not an opera singer and purposely, I think, chose to make the Phantom much more raw than the Michael Crawford version.  He needed to make it his own and he did.  His voice was corse and edgey for a reason.  The emotion, passion and vulnerability in his performance is so perfect, you have to see the movie several times to catch all the subtle nuaniances in his portrayal.  He was cast as the Phantom by Joel and Andrew for a reason.  They wanted an updated, dark and more sexy Phantom.  So people who bash him because he is not Crawford, the whole purpose was something new.  Get over it!Emmy was very good with a great voice and perfect face.  Because she is a teenager, she does not have the depth of experince and emotion to draw on for her acting.  But that is what Joel wanted.  Otherwise he would have cast a much older actress that could pass for a teenager which happens more often then not.  But that last scene, she was magnificant.Patrick as Raoul was perfectly cast.  The perfect 'knight in shining armor' for Christine.  Such  beautiful voice compared to the edgy voice of Gerard.  His character was made much stronger in the movie than the play.  I think it had to be because in this movie the Phantom was so much more physically appealing than in the stage version that Raoul had to be more macho.  It had to be so it would make so much more sense that she chose Raoul over the Phantom.I think this movie version is exactly what AL Webber wanted.  It has his stamp and he wanted to bring this story to all those who do not live close to a big city and have the means to go to the stage production.  He wanted to bring the story to everyday movie goers.  That is what he did.  And I think he did a great job.  I would have been very disapointed had the movie been just a repeat rendition of the stage play.  The movie made it so much more real to me.10 stars **********	5.0	Blew me away!	2005-02-18	5	5	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1XBDV6MBB8E6D	lindsirae	Really, really awesome! I haven't seen any other version, but I have heard the soundtrack from the Broadway version, so I can compare a bit there.Here's what I think about the cast, stariting with Emmy.Emmy Rossum: Wonderful choice for Christine. It's amazing to think she was only sixteen when they filmed The Phantom. Her voice is of someone far beyond her years. I prefer her to Sarah Brightman though, because, even though she sounds as if she's had years more training and practice, she still has that young, innocent, sweet sound you need for a good Christine. And you can tell she really loves the Phantom, especially in The Point of No Return, and near the end, when she sings 'Pitiful creature of shadow, what kind of life have you known? God give me courage to show you, you are not alone' and kisses him.Gerard Butler: Great as the Phantom! He puts so much emotion into his voice, which I think Michael Crawfor lacks. I do think it is a bit strange that he's so young though (the Phantom is supposed to be older and uglier), but still, he gives an outstanding performance. It's really heartbraking to hear him at the end, when Christine and Raoul and in the boat rowing away, and he sings the line 'Christine, I love you' from All I Ask of You.Patrick Wilson: I seriously don't get why everyone hates Parick!!! I've read everything from his voice is wooden to he has bad facial expressions to his hair is too long. What is wrong with him???????? Patrick Wilson plays an excellent Raoul. He's everything the young suitor is supposed to be: handsome, confident, loving and protective of Christine, and seemingly pure good (you just can't really detect anything bad about him when he's sitting up on that grand white horse of his, or sacraficing himself for Christine, now, can you?). I think he has a great voice and my heart just melted when he sang All I Ask of You with Christine. That's my favorite song in the entire movie for sure. and why does everyone hate Raoul as a character, too? Being young, handsome, rich, and in love is not a crime. Yeah, he's whiny and babyish at times, but he loved Christine, didn't he? What's wrong with that? In the end it was Christine's descision - he didn't make her love him.Minnie Drive - Great as Carlotta. Even though her voice was dubbed (though she does sing the ending credits song, Learn to be Lonely), she has that perfect, cocky attitude Carlotta needs. Carlotta is really a good comic relief charcter. You just can't help but laught at her way-too-dramatic,over-the-top performances.Simon Callow and Ciarin Hinds - Perfect opera house managers! Just like Carlotta, they're comic relief. They're really funny in the beginning of the song Notes. Especially when they're reading one of the letters where the Phantom wrote 'Dear Firmin just a brief reminder, my salary has not been paid' they sound absolutely infuriated and practically spit the 'my salary has not been paid' part.I thought the ending of the movie was very interesting, too. It never truly ends. What happens to the Phantom is never really said, and I found it strange that they showed an aged Raoul going back to Christine's grave.Overall, I really love this movie and would definitely recommend it to any Phantom fans!	5.0	The Phantom is Phantastic!	2005-04-11	6	5	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A90WQOV1WAZQI	"Linly ""Linly"""	True, the movie version might not have been quite what was expected, but keep in mind the Andrew Lloyd Webber was very invloved in the filming of this movie and he was quite pleased with the result. So, if you're truly a fan of the original and of Webber, just keep it in mind.This includes Gerard Butler. Alot of people don't like his being the Phantom, but it is impressive that he went from lead singer in a rock band to Opera and pleased Webber. Personally, I really loved the movie and listening to the soundtrack still gives me chills, but I can understand some of the criticisms.	4.0	Trust in Webber	2005-01-01	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2LJKDPRVR907S	Lisa Siegel	Phantom of the Opera has to be my absolute favorite musical that I have ever seen.  I saw it on stage in 1992...the only time I saw it.  I fell in love with it so I bought the original cast CD of it and naturally loved that as well (it may have something to do with Michael Crawford's voice;).Anyway, when I heard that Phantom was coming on to the big screen, I must admit that I was a bit skeptical at first.  I wasn't sure if a musical of this genre could make the transition from stage to screen.  I am so glad that I was proven wrong!!!I went to see the movie about 2 days after it premiered and let me just sum it up in one word: WOW.  The music, actors, scenery, costumes, everything was magnificent!  Gerard Butler (The Phantom) was excellent in his role.  I was not at all familiar with him before seeing this movie.  His emotions that he put into the role made me feel so bad for the Phantom!  There were times that I wanted Christine to end up with him!Emmy Rossum (Christine) was brilliant!  Sure, she's no Sarah Brightman, but she is most definitely a rising star.  It is very hard to believe that she was only 16 years old when they filmed the movie.  She has a voice of, well, an angel!  And to top it off, she is absolutely gorgeous.Patrick Wilson (Raoul) was amazing as well.  I had no idea that he had come from the stage originally.  His voice was truly amazing, as was his acting.The supporting cast was amazing as well.  Minnie Driver is the perfect Carlotta.  She just fit into the role so well and I loved her accent!  She was indeed a great 'Primma Donna.'  Miranda Richardson (Madame Giry) did a wonderful job as the very mysterious woman who somehow knew the Phantom, but kept it to herself, until she told Raoul about how she met him.  Yet she was still amazing.Overall, I give this movie a 10/10.  Kudos to Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher who made a wonderful team.  Minnie Driver's song Learn to be Lonely was terrific.  Thank you, ALW, for turning such a wonderful play into an incredible movie.If you are a fan of musicals, especially of Andrew Lloyd Webber's, I highly recommend you rent and/or buy this DVD today!  The special features are mind blowing.  Trust me--you will fall in love with it.	5.0	Great Transition from the Stage to the Screen	2005-05-07	5	4	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL	Little Miss Cutey	I love the music and the storyline in Phantom.  However, as spectacular as the sets were, Gerard Butler absolutely ruined this for me.  I was cringing listening to him sing.  I would have thought that Mr Webber would have made a much better choice and scrutinized the vocal performances more than he obviously did.  Is Gerard an actuall trained singer or not?If you watch this with the sound off (there goes the beautiful music), at least you'll still have a beautiful visual.

Sure it a rock voice but that's what makes the part, that and the emotion he potrays with his voice.  If he sang the role perfectly he would be completely souless.  It's what makes his charcter different to Raoul.... the perfect gentleman with a polite, emotionless voice, like his character.  The Phantom on the otherhand is more red-blooded and needs a more emotional voice...... which I think Gerry portrays wonderfully.	5.0	What! are you deaf?	2005-07-06	6	6	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A31MMLQF124TNP	"Lizzie ""book_worm81"""	"I am sad to say this was a vastly disappointing effort. The start had promise...the dilapidated Opera returning to it's original splendor while the overture plays and the chandalier is raised during the auction...ah, the high point of the movie.Then, someone (Weber) decided to let Emmy Rossum sing.She has a completely normal voice. Not ""hideous"" by any means. Just completely not believable as the ingenue the character is supposed to be. There is nothing spectacular or even remotely noteworthy about her performance, singing or acting. She shows us only one emotion and a deer-in-the-headlights-look for the entire movie. It is hard to buy into a movie about the opera world when the supposed ""star"" can't manage a full sound and hold a note with any consistency. The character of Christine Daae is supposed to blow you away. Emmy Rossum leaves you wondering how much Valium she's been given.Gerard Butler's Phantom is too young, and again, not even Michael Crawford mediocre. There are moments where he slips into a rock-n-roll type if voice that just doesn't fit.Minne Driver is semi-amusing, although stands out because she is one of only two characters that had any dimension at all to their performance.The only character that had an appealing voice and a decent acting performance was Raoul. Had it not been for him it would have been like watching mannequins performing a puppet version of Phantom. Unfortunatley he could get no response from Christine or any of his other actors.There were things in the story they changed and details that made no sense to change. Magic they can create on the stage which takes your breath away through stunts, etc. that they chose to leave out of the movie. For what reason? If it is do-able on a stage, shouldn't it be a piece of cake to recreate on a movie screen?The sets and costumes were lovely (if a bit ridiculous in their unnecessaty sexual overture)but even the opulence of the set could not save this show.A sad attempt. A sad day for musicals. I must see it on stage again to revive good feelings about the entire thing."	1.0	Schumacher didn't get it.	2004-12-23	20	4	16
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A36PR99BSM8KQX	Lizzy	Okay, I can actually understand why some of you hated it. I laughed at the one-star reviews and agreed with some things said, while disagreeing with a lot.Let me start by saying I am a Phan. A huge Phan, and not of the musical alone. I started with the books! Books being the original and unsurpassed and the wonderful Phantom by Susan Kay. Before I fell in love with the music and before I even knew there was going to be a movie, I loved those books and Erik, and I hated Raoul and I hated Christine even more. Then, I discovered the musical, somewhat accidentally, when my mom bought a copy of The Best of Michael Crawford. I heard Music of the Night and knew I would forever love the musical as well. I have not seen the stage version yet, I'll be seeing it in a few months. Now, onto the movie.First, the sets and costumes. I loved both because there were so garish, opulent and excessive. This was the opera! The costumes were supposed to be extravagant and colorful, so I can see why they were cast like that. My only complaint was that not a single scene could pass when you weren't assaulted with Emmy Rossum's cleavage. The boys must have loved it. =) And I HATED the dress for Think of Me!  Is the opera Hannibal or Cinderella? =KOkay, now the music in general. Yes, I agree, Butler is not the best singer ever. BUT his voice is masculine and raspy and veryveryvery sexy, like I would imagine the Phantom's voice being. Rossum's voice wasn't as good as Christine should have been, but it did reflect how she was feeling pretty well. Raoul...Oh, Wilson. His voice is GORGEOUS. It's the reason I am buying the soundtrack.Okay, about Butler. Gerard Butler is a gorgeous man in his prime, an actor to the core and not a singer, in the prime of his life trying to play a grumpy old aging genius. In the movie, he looks about 35, 40 at the VERY oldest. Admittedly, he couldn't sing as well as Erik should have nor was he old enough or ugly enough, but come on. The screen has its priced, and he brought the passion and sorrow of Erik to the screen well. BE A LITTLE FORGIVING. He did a good job and you know it.Ah, now Christine. Emmy Rossum can sing, that is a fact. But I didn't like her! I hated Christine naturally, but Rossum is not a fantastic actress. During the whole movie, I always thought, 'Heh. She's a crackhead.' cause that's what she looked like. One emotion: Totally smashed.Raoul. Oh, Patrick Wilson is gorgeous and can sing and was as pathetic as Raoul but a bit more likable. He was fine as the role.Now, changes they made. Moving the chandelier crash, changing outfits, changing sets, changing events. It could make a diehard Phan mad, but trust me, I am one and it didn't bother me. You people act like a movie is supposed to be the Holy Grail of entertainment. Yes, some things were laughable. Yes, the M15M parody was HILARIOUS. But the movie was GOOD. No matter what you say. Admit it. It was interesting and you felt sorry for Erik. Come on. You know you loved it.Anyway. In conclusion. I am a diehard Phan, and I loved the movie. It got 4 stars because I hated Rossum's total lack of emotion. She deserves an Award for Most Superior Cleavage Showing Crackhead. Nothing more. And DANG was Gerard gorgeous as heck. The movie was entertaining and sad. So there. BAM.*ching goes the ugly monkey box*	4.0	Gorgeous. Now listen to me.	2005-02-24	8	3	5

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1CROFPEPYNIZK	LKayH	I just saw it last night, and I loved it just as much as the stage musical, which I saw more than once.  Better still, this one I can see a couple more times without being out $60 a pop!POTO (Phantom Of the Opera) has always gotten mixed reviews. It lacks the snob appeal that attracts the kind of people who usually enjoy staged musicals and operas, so right off, a big part of the core audience turns up its nose.  This show is really more for the average person, someone who likes tunes that haunt the mind, a sexy story, and a bit of a thrill, and who is willing to let down the hypercritical guard and just enjoy the ride.Emily Rossum's voice is quite stunning - the role requires an incredible range, and she not only had that, but she was able to go from this floaty, ingenue voice to a throaty seductress.  I was a little put off by the way they lit her up so she kind of glowed in the dark in one scene - this girl is so pretty on her own I don't think she needs the help.I thought Gerard Butler, the guy who played Phantom, was an excellent choice.  I had hoped they'd get this made sooner so Crawford could do it, but at 62, much as I love the guy's voice and his rendering of this character, he's not right for the part anymore.  Phantom should be much older than Christine, but not three times her age.  At thirty-something, Butler's Phantom is old enough to be her father, which works with her mindset, but still young enough to be a possible romantic interest.  What drives the tragic aspect of this is that there is the possibility of a romance, there is that spark of attraction, but it's always just out of his reach.  Butler's voice isn't nearly as nice as Michael Crawford's, but he made up for it in other ways. With the mask and wig, this guy is so gorgeous that you gotta wonder what red-blooded woman could possibly prefer Raoul to him (and Raoul is pretty appealing!). And Butler brought some nuances to the part that I liked.  His portrayal is darker, and you see a little more of the madness, which helps the viewer to understand Christine's choices.I liked this Raoul a lot better too.  I can't put my finger on what's different this time, but it seems like Wilson's version is more fully developed, more substantial.  In the stage show Raoul seemed pretty shallow, and thus I kind of disliked Christine for falling for him so quickly.  And this guy's voice is just awesome!Also Minnie Driver simply steals the show as the Prima Donna - I don't recall liking the stage versions as much either. She is the only person whose voice is dubbed - the real singer, Margaret Preece, has a brief appearance in one of the Operas.There is one legitimate grumble about this show.  The script has some major weak points, places where, without giving anything away, it's hard to understand what the good guys are thinking walking into an obvious trap.  This happens at such a central part of the show that it kind of distracts from the tension, which is why I knocked off one star.  But by that time I'm usually so caught up in the seduction of it that I'm way past caring.It boils down to this: If you love the music, the story, and the whole Phantom romance thing, you won't care. If you aren't enthralled by these things, then the faults will probably bother you.	4.0	Loved it!	2004-12-24	5	5	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AN94YI3URSAII	Lostgirl	"I'm a fan from way back. I've noticed that most reviews compare the cast of this film with this Original London Cast Rercording (the most popular recording of the show). This bothers me for several reasons: I think things should be based on their own merit and comparing this to one recording ignore the hundreds of other performers who have played these roles. It also ignores the fact that film and stage are different mediums for which different things are appropriate.So what does that mean for this film and this cast? Well I hate to say it but Gerard Butler knocks a star off my rating. He is very probably the worst Phantom I've ever seen/heard. Oh what this film could have been with a different leading man! The story dictates that the Phantom is two things: deformed and a supernaturally brilliant singer. Why the young, good looking yet vocally challenged Butler was cast is beyond me. Andrew Lloyd Webber says in the DVD extras that he liked the ""rock n' roll"" edge that Butler's voice had. Well, I say you can find good singers with the same ""edge"". Butler not only has a weak voice and poor control of it, he also tries to express emotion by alternating volumes: he yells and whispers to indicate anger and sadness. His notes are  kept as short as possible and when he has to hold one he sounds as if he's on the point of breaking. If he were in an amateur production or singing karaoke I'd say he's alright. Here he falls amazingly short. As a character he is not the darkly romantic figure or the genius tormented by madness: he's a boring guy who lives in a basement and whines when he doesn't get his way. And the Phantom is not meant to be young or physically attractive- he represents a twisted father figure to Christine.  It's more of a challenge for an actor to draw sympathy from an audience based on his voice, his small emotional gestures, and in spite of hideous makeup. Butler's voice isn't enought to draw emotion on it's own. His looks are marred by a sunburn and his age is young enough to make him more of a romantic prospect for Christine in the eyes of the audience. I give Butler credit for making the attempt but his Phantom is the weak point in this production.People claim that Raoul is a boring character which I understand to a certain extent but he's a necessary one. He loves Christine in a healthy way while the Phantom's love is a dangerous obsession. He's stable where the Phantom isn't. Vocally Patrick Wilson is everything that Gerard Butler is not.  He sings with a strong, polished tenor voice that's well suited to his character: a handsome young nobleman. Physically he is well suited to his role (though I could have lived without the Fabio inspired hairdo).At 16 Emmy Rossum was a full 10 years younger than most stage Christines when she took on the role. Vocally speaking that's a lot, and she sounds young. Her voice is breathy and with a few more years of training it would have been much stronger on the higher notes. While it might not get by on stage it's just right for film: it has a pure, sweet sound that's suited to the character. Rossum allows it to grow with the film. In her opening sequence ""Think of Me"" it's soft but as the character goes though emotional trials her voice gains it's footing and some more strength. It takes on a haunting quality in the mournful ballad ""Wishing You Where Somehow Here Again"" and shows some rich darker colors in the title song and the ""Point of No Return"". Rossum is also a good actress: she's been criticized for using too few facial expressions but I felt that she conveyed what she had to when she had to (how many facial expressions are meant to be employed when one's character is hypnotized?). Her Christine has an innocent, melancholy allure.As for the direction  it's alternately wonderful and absurd. I loved Joel Shumaker's visual references to Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast, and his reimagining of The Point of No Return which is quite different from the stage version. But he seems too intent on making the film ""sexy"" by putting the women in lowcut dresses and casting a sexy but utterly inappropriate Phantom. The story, the music and the lyrics have a dark sensuality but Schumaker underestimates the intelligence of his audience by beating them over the head with it. Also he seems unsure of what to do with his camera during solos. In ""Think of Me"" we watch Christine standing still onstage, in ""Music of the Night"" we watch the Phantom lead Christine aimlessly around his lair and in ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" we see Christine walk through a cemetary. I can't help but think all 3 could have been more interesting in more able hands.If I could give this 3 and 1/2 stars I would but as it is I have to subtract one star due to Gerard Butler's performance and another for Schumaker's overbearing direction (though if I could I'd only take way 1/2 a star for that)"	3.0	Flawed but still worth the price	2006-02-24	13	7	6
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AG8U6F6226GBZ	Lotte	The first part of the movie was OK.  I had seen the show at the Kennedy Center years before, and loved it.  I had the CD for about a year, and played it all the time when I was driving to and from work. And knew all the songs and music.  I also bought the music book.I couldn't wait to see the show, and I wasn't disappointed.  It was great.  I watched it today on a DVD I'd had for a couple years; maybe because tomorrow is Halloween. I was greatly disappointed after the first half hour. Parts of it were like the show and parts of it looked like they were just stuck in.  Most of it was pretty bad.  I didn't watch it till the end.  I prefer to remember the real show.  The movie was somebody's interpretation, and his interpretation had little to do with Phantom.I give it 2 stars because some of the vocals were OK.	2.0	First Part Was OK, then ...........	2010-10-30	6	2	4
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1H3ZATBDMOJ6Z	Louis Barbarelli	"This movie is pitiful.  Gerald Butler is miscast, can't sing and his ""hideous"" disfigurement resembles little more than a moderate case of acne on one cheek. His makeup also changes from shot to shot.  Rossum is beautiful but she sleepwalks through the part and her voice is sometimes screechy.  Inexplicably, the beautiful and strategically important disguises worn by the Phantom in the stage play (the Lon-Chaney-inspired skeleton costume at the masquerade ball and the monk-like, identity-concealing robe during ""The Point of No Return"" sequence) are not used in the film.  Butler employs none of the stealthy, graceful moves associated with this musical phantom (he just tosses his cape around stupidly) and even the legendary music seems wan and listless much of the time.  I've waited for this movie for more than 15 years.  What a total disappointment.  This piece of overblown cinematic junk just wasn't worth screwing Michael Crawford out of a chance at film immortality.  And, if not Crawford, what about Antonio Banderas who was supposed to have been signed to play the phantom?  He would have been terrific.  Even John Travolta, who was interested in the role, would have been vastly superior to Butler.  The casting of Butler is eerily reminiscent of the disastrous casting of George Lazenby in the role of James Bond a few decades ago.  In fact, Butler even looks like Lazenby. You've made too many big mistakes in putting this film together, Sir Andrew. You've transformed the best stage musical of all time into the worst movie musical of all time.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2EWZ2SK6A0RGQ	Lourdes	"After having seen this movie starring my favorite actor, Gerard Butler, I am now a true-blue Phanatic of the PHantom.  His love for Christine and the pain he has been made to endure, by God and by Man, makes him a figure that millions can identify with.Gerard Butler has brought this mysterious Man-Angel of Music to the masses, giving the story a wider berth of empathy, understanding and acceptance.  I thank Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber as well for their cinematic vision.  They have created a ""new deep emotional center"" for the Phantom.This is a beautiful movie with a beautiful and talented cast.  Emmy Rossum is divine, catapulting one so young to true stardom.  I cannot say enough about Gerard Butler.  I loved his voice.  He is so multi-talented; to me he is like the next Richard Burton.  GB is truly mastering his thespian-hood.  Not only is he captivating as Erik, he humanizes him as no other actor has done before on film or stage.  He is adored world-wide for this role.GREAT MUSICAL!"	5.0	Gerard Butler is THE Phantom for ME!	2005-07-03	6	6	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A18DQEAVHNUI8W	Lovely, Lovely	I feel sorry for all the people who listened to the reviews of this film and decided it wasn't worth putting out the money to see; the critics did a great disservice to the public with their reviews of this film.  Anybody who did not have the chance to see this production sitting in a theater with a big screen and surround sound and have the opportunity to witnes the beauty of the color, costumes and have the passion of the Phantom envelope them has been cheated of a wonderful experience.I have seen the stage production and the movie is soo much more, it's the difference between seeing it in 3D as apposed to 1 dimensional.I have seen this movie 5 times and each time it was more wonderful. At this point I am going through withdrawals, as it is no longer showing in our local theater (I don't know if I can wait for May 3 and its DVD release).Granted, Gerard Butler may not have the high tenor range of Michael Crawford, but his more masculine tones gives us a much more powerful and sensual Phantom.  Some may feel that he can not fill Michael's shoes, but I feel that his shoes are right beside Michael's, if not slightly ahead of them.  Christine was a wonderful, beautifull and innocent girl, but yet able to demonstrate the passion that the Phantom could invoke in her (Point of no Return duet).I too shed tears at the end of the film 1) because it was over, and 2)for Christine for passing up the opportunity to share the love and the passion of the Phantom.	5.0	Wonderful	2005-02-23	9	8	1

I was excited to see they'd made a film including Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, though I didn't have high expectations of a film version.  Boy, was I ever suprized!  The film adds so much intensity to the torment Christine feels.  The acting was wonderful, the sets were amazing, and the music was true to Broadway (the actor's voices were superb).  I also enjoyed the addition of the auction years after Christine's opera career had ended.  If you've seen the play, enjoy the movie as an even more moving and close-up version.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A17957R7J7Q5SY	Lucy Rose	If you are obsessed with the play and soundtrack, don't see this movie.  Joel Schumacher's direction was terrible.  Girard Butler, as the Phantom, is completely miscast.  Minnie Driver, as Carlotta, saves the play.  She is actually quite good.  I had the feeling that she did not listen to the director at all and did her own thing, which worked well.  Emmy Rossum is acceptable as Christine.  The supporting cast is also decent. The script has several minor and major differences from the play.  Those obsessed with the play and soundtrack will find even the minor changes annoying.  Then again, the changes would have been acceptable if the acting and singing had been better; especially that of the Phantom who makes you cringe when he speaks or sings.  Why did Andrew Lloyd Webber allow this movie to happen? whhyyy? whhyyy?	2.0	Very Disappointing.	2004-12-26	16	4	12

Although I've never seen the play, I know that basic plot of it, and I know every song by heart.  ALW wrote these songs specifically for Sarah's voice and nobody elses.  I'm positive that these new actors/actresses simply WILL NOT be as good as Sarah and Michael.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A6018FNGOGDHW	"Lynn M. Driscoll ""Joycelyn Driscoll 'hopeful ..."	"I am a huge Phantom fan and love to sing it I want to sing in it when I get older being only 14 years of age. I have brought myself to new heights when seeing the movie. I saw something I had wanted to see for years. I have never seen the broadway production but have seen the movie 3 times. I do however have the liberetto of the play and the original cast recording so it is not that I dont know what happens. Seeing the movie gave me a chance to have more of an idea for what happened and that I am happy for! I thought it was amazing. I even bought the movie soundtrack! After singing this I felt like I could see more of what I should do when singing and could feel more of the character and by so doing this I hit the notes in the song The Phantom of the Opera the end notes! Something very hard for a person my age. I believe it is a good insite to the play. Though I was angry that some of the lines were spoken and some of the words were changed and the chandelier fell at the wrong time and Raoul was more the hero instead of The Phantom I still enjoyed it. I have also read the book and was happy that they had the horse and the torture chamber!!!!! Which I didnt get the torture chamber the first time I saw it cause I was still working on the book but then the second time I enjoyed it more cause I understood what it was. Also I will say this they didnt do a good job in explaining why we should ""Keep our hands at the level of our eyes"" which would have been better if they would have explained a little bit more. I was also dissipointed that they didnt have Madame Giry sing her part about how it was madness to order the police especially since she was right behind them. I do admit I had my doubts I didnt think Gerard Butler could pull off Erik (The Phantom) especially in The Music of the Night and I would hate to see that song messed up since it is my absoulute favorite! But when he got to that song and he started singing it I was amazed he truly could sing he truly had a voice. I enjoyed his portayel of The Phantom but I wished the graveyard scene would have been more true to the play! I wanted to see the skulls shoot fire and I also wanted to hear Raoul sing his part in ""Wandering Child"" I also wanted to see The Phantom dissapear by sweeping his cloak over him not by busting through a mirror though I did like the effect of it. It had amazing special effects and it stuck close to the original score. Showing me that is was a good movie. I went the first day of the first showing and I adored it. Me and my friend saw many fans there and many people who had never even heard of the play. I was happy that many people who knew nothing of it went and saw it so that maybe they would earn a respect for it and enjoy it as much as I do. There was a standing encore at the end of the movie everyone stood and clapped and many screamed Bravo me being one of many. I enjoyed it greatlly and thought it was worth the money! I know it can never compare to the stage show and wait in anticipation to see it. But never the less I reccomend the movie to everyone!"	5.0	I loved it!	2005-01-12	3	1	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1AX8W5GHZS8A7	LyreKat	I have always love the stage version of The Phantom of the Opera. Though not faithful to the orginal novel, I still found it to be a great creation that showed a more favorable image of the Phantom. I was overjoyed when I heard that there was a movie of the stage version in the works. I knew that Sarah Brightman was not going to play the lead but I had rather hoped that Michael Crawford was going to play the part of the Phantom. Some may not consider him to be the ideal for the big screen but he has proven himself over and over to be the perfect Phantom.I am curious to see the film but after seeing the preview online, I am doubtful of the finished product. The preview seems campy and almost cheap. This is not how the stage version is. It is lushous, dark and emotional and this does not come across in the preview.I am worried that this movie may harm the stage version as so many cross-overs have.

I went in the movie theater without any preconceived notions. I came out sighing and loving the movie! I love everything about it! The part I loved most was when Christine and Raoul were singing ""All I ask of you"". They felt the song...I felt the song. I was so touched by it and the emotions on their faces I almost bawled my eyes out! Patrick Wilson and Emmy Rossum were fantastic! I like Minnie Driver as Carlotta. I suppose she was supposed to be a bit over-the-top because she IS the prima donna of ""L'opera Populaire"". The person I liked least was the Phantom. I didn't really feel his pain or loneliness. I think he's quite dashing and very handsome though. Gerard Butler's voice was nice but it kind of falls flat when you compare it to Emmy Rossum's. I really, really love this movie.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AA7MKW7M23E9W	"Mac ""Reviewer"""	"Someone, quite recently, as well as long ago, said that the film version of the musical was dead. If memory serves, they said it died with ""Hello Dolly"" or some such work. Anyone who believes that will need to watch ""Phantom: on DVD.Let me start by saying that while I liked the Broadway show, I was able to see it for what it was: a bit over the top with regards to sets and a stretch as far as some of the choice of orchestrations, etc. So I was expecting pretty much a filmed version of that, much as the film version of ""Sweeney Todd"" ---and I loved the show AND the film---is.  Not so. This DVD version will grab you by the throat and not let go until it's through with you visually, psychologically, and emotionally.I'm truly amazed that I had not even heard of this movie, until I stumbled across it by accident. The opening is remarkable, with black-and-white footage of Paris and the ""aftermath."" The transition from BW to color is even more remarkable, with camera techniques that are perfect and a set that outdoes the original--if you can believe that. Truly, the set design in this movie is the real star, but it doesn't overshadow the performers or the music and plot. It all works together wonderfully. Visually, this film is perfectly stunning and you'll have to watch it more than once.My only concern was with the quaility of some of the singer's voices. For the most part they were superb, but there were a few raggady notes here and there. Other than that, not much to complain about.Back to why I liked it:  Stunning costumes, sets, and beautiful music (made even more so by better orchestrations---there must be at least twelve French horns in the orchestra on this one) all add up to a great emotional and intellectual experience. The timing is right on, and there's never a moment of bordeom. Suffice it to say that if the film version of the American musical is dead, ""Phantom"" has awakened it.Frankly, I wouldn't go to the B'way musical another time, but I've watched this movie now, probably, say, five times, and have yet to get bored or find great fault with it.  One of the best."	5.0	Really not enough stars for this DVD	2006-10-02	9	7	2

To correct the self-proclaimed ""witch-hunter"":""One scene springs to mind when he leaps on a gargoyle and yells `that's all I ask of youuuuuuuuuuu!!!'""At least do your homework and quote it correctly!""The added storyline about him being in a circus freak show is bull. This man is supposed to be a genius but he makes huge mistakes in the movie and it ruined his character.""Seems that this person hasn't read Leroux's book as Erik has been among gypsies indeed (As a showcase) in his youth and he wasn't with them because they loved him. Darling, it's not the actor making ""mistakes"", that actually IS the storyline, it's the storyline of the stage-show as well. Too bad that you don't seem to have a clue.""He starts off with a little mask on, black slicked down hair, normal visible skin and then she whips it off and all of a sudden half this guys face is deformed even his hairline has receded, and speaking of hair, its now a rather sandy colour and sticks out, obviously in an attempted to achieve that `mad scientist' look It ruins the whole moment.""God, are you blind? He's wearing a WIG! And what not! He wears a wig in the show too and so?""And his death...that didn't happen. In the book he plays his organ (why does that sound bad, I have a dirty mind) until the whole opera house caves in on top off him.""Were you actually reading LEROUX's book? What you're describing sounds like the ending of the campy Phantom-movie with Claude Rains. (BAD stuff!) So you have NOT read the book, aren't able to recognize that the Phantom wore a wig and what not? Tell you what, such ignorance is laughable.I loved this movie but I love the stage-show even more! Try to catch both!Addition:Well, she also says now:""You say it's a wig, oh really! In those days, they didn't have wigs that good for heaven sakes.""Yes, they did. In fact it is pretty easy to produce a wig like that. Watch the scene where the Phantom is preparing for ""The Point of no Return"" (""Let my opera begiiiiiiiiin!"" ends that scene) he's ADJUSTING what is obviously a wig on his head. As for 19th century wigs: They had REAL HAIR wigs that looked AMAZINGLY real on men and women. Women who copied Elisabeth of Austria's hairstyle (Her hair went down to her toes) used fake hair and wigs to perfection.""If the director intended for the phantom to wear a wig he should of made it obvious.""He did. In the scene I described above. Hell, there's even ANOTHER wig on one of the stone-heads near the Phantom in that scene (Look down at his left side). (Guess he had to switch them now and then) How much more obvious can it BE until you get it?

WITH MUSIC!!!From the customs, the scenery, the dances, everything is great... The only down point is the Phantom itself. Although I like Gerard Buttler as an actor, I think he wasn't the best choice for the character, the song ""Music of the night"" sounds weak compared with great phantoms like Alessandro Safina and the greatest Michael Crawford (The original!). Emmy Rossum is excellent as Christine, she is young, beautiful and definitelly CAN SING!! Big Hurray for her. Minnie Driver is very adorable and perfect!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1B05INWIDZ74O	M. A. Ramos	Though not my favorite musical of all time I did get to see it twice on stage. Once on Broadway when it opened and the second time when the Broadway show was first taken on tour. Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote this as a stage musical that just happens to be set in an opera house. It is not, and never was, meant to be classified as an opera.He wrote this musical with the thought of his then wife Sarah Brightman in mind. And it is one of the reason she is brilliant on stage as Christine. It is regretful that the movie took so long to arrange production that they could not keep the original cast. It was truly our loss. Yet there was a pleasent suprise in the casting of Emmy Rossum as Christine Daae. And Patrick Wilson did well as Raoul.This movie does a very good job of translating from stage to screen. Some of the score has been changed, and there was no reason for it. And because he could, the director added some background that is contrary to the story and some scenes that take way from the mystery. But the movie is still worth owning if you like Broadway musicals. And even though I am not giving it five stars, most will want to see it more then once.The premise of the movie is that the Phantom lives beneath the Paris Opera and terrorizes those who work there. And he demands that Christine is the star of their productions. But when she turns her back on the phantom's advances and her lover Raoul starts to interfere, the Phantom does all he can to take his perceived need for revenge and to try and capture the love of Christine. This is truly a story of a fateful love triangle. Most of the music is haunting and memorable.	4.0	A suspenseful love triangle	2007-02-25	2	2	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2RJFIETRAMKK5	Marcus Collin	Having seen this movie on a huge screen at the Zeigfeld in NYC, I can honestly say that I gave it my best shot. The casting is hideous, emmy rossum is obviously a terrible singer, if she sang at the Met, she must have been in the children's chorus, because that's exactly what she sounds like. The casting of the Phantom is insipid and ridiculous. The only good casting is that of Patrick Wilson, his portrayal seems real and heartfelt, and of Minnie Driver, although I was saddened to hear that her singing was dubbed. Her speaking and acting made the film for me. I used to like this show, what with it being the closest thing to grand overblown opera on broadway, but this movie really sucks. The singing is bad, the dancing is AWFUL, it all looks like Madonna-esque voguing with no real thought behind it, the original choreography was much better. Why do people think they can improve on what people like so much already? I mean, its drivel to begin with, but it had style. In this film, the style is caricatured and cheapened. Do yourself a favor, get another movie.	1.0	This movie is awful	2005-08-29	41	23	18
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2X9AXCWH4MT4I	"Marcy G. ""MarcyG"""	"You know that a movie works when it follows you long after you've left the movie theater.  I saw the Broadway tour of ""Phantom of the Opera"" a few years ago and it has been my favorite musical since. I love it more than Cats, 42nd Street, West Side Story, Les Miserables, Miss Saigon...you name it. Its romanticism and beautiful songs just blew me away.I was then somewhat hesitant to see the film version, fearing that it would not live up to my expectations. A little over two hours later and I found myself crying over the Phantom (Gerard Butler) and his love for the young Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum) as she decides between him or the nobleman Raoul (Patrick Wilson).In short, I love this movie! It was everything I had hoped it to be and more. The story is faithful to the stage version but it also gives the audience a closer look into the lives of the three main characters. The art direction, sets and costumes are resplendent and breath-taking. And the songs are brought to life superbly by the talented cast of young newcomers (Rossum, Wilson) and film veterans (Miranda Richardson, Ciaran Hinds, Simon Callow).I know many would argue that Michael Crawford was a superb Phantom...that is, except for me.  I always felt that Crawford's voice was too high-pitched and not manly enough. To me, Gerard Butler is more effective Phantom. Apart from being incredibly handsome (under that make-up), tall and well built, he also has this rough and raspy voice that is very masculine and full of passion. He IS the Phantom! Emmy Rossum has a hauntingly beautiful voice and has an innocence and sweetness that fits perfectly for Christine.  Her voice gives me goosebumps! Patrick Wilson's romantic voice contrasts well with that of the Phantom's. After all, one is supposed to be a nobleman and the romantic hero while the other is dark, mysterious and brooding (like the misunderstood Quasimodo of ""Hunchback of the Notre Dame."") But even without the singing, Gerard Butler turns in a memorable and passionate performance as the Phantom and you really do feel for him in the end. If there was one fault to this film, for me, it would be Minnie Driver's Carlotta. She was so over the top that I sometimes found her grating.All in all, however, I walked out of the theater wanting to see ""Phantom of the Opera"" again and again (I've now seen it twice and counting). I couldn't get the music out of my head and have since purchased the CD.  I can't wait for the dvd to come out so I can watch it over and over. I highly recommend it to fans of the stage version, music lovers and incurable romantics everywhere.  And if you loved the songs, be sure to pick up the equally superb soundtrack. This phantom will haunt you long after you've left the movie theater....and I have gladly fallen under its spell. Superb!"	5.0	Haunting, romantic and truly  memorable............	2005-02-18	213	200	13
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1M82Z8DQG4IMA	"Margaret Bauer ""hoodsportjo"""	As only classics can this story probes the depths of our subliminal fantasies.  There is a shadow( as Jung would call it) or a phantom in us all.  It is no accident that the phantom captures  Christine and takes her [not so unwillingly ] to the subterraean depths.  Good and evil are prominent themes and the mixture thereof.  Only Raoul seems completely pure and good riding his white horse to rescue his true love from the clutches of her other love and his dark rival - the angel of music and the night.I had never read a review and now I am glad of that. It was not the stage musical nor was it supposed to be.  The film performances were excellent - all of them.  They stand alone.I thought the switching back and forth from B/W to color for present and past very effective. There was a certain mystery in that because it was easy to assume that the older woman who nodded at the elderly Raoul in the auction scene might have been an older Christine.  I actually thought it was until the very end.  Now I know it was Madame Gidy's daughter who had a small but significant role in the story.And being an incurable romantic I love a good love story.  All of the really great love stories are tragic ones like Gone with the Wind and Out of Africa,  And of course - the pain and anquish of unrequited love, the horror of the distortion of a soul as well as a face, the poignancy, the innocence, the irony, the pathos all of which eats at your heart and brings back your sweetest and darkest memories.  And, yes, takes your breath away.Music beyond my dreams especially the opening organ which fills all space.  Comedic parts adding much to the otherwise somber plot.  Majestic cinematography...Terrific.  And I have only seen it once...so far...I look forward to all the other times.	5.0	The Phantom in all of us.	2005-03-12	6	6	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3MB575TWCXP	Maria Hauskins	I loved this prodution. Although nothing can compare to the experience of live theatre, this movie is a close second. I must say I was a little skeptical at first of how good the music would be compared to Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford. But I think the actors have lived up to their standard. I was extremely impressed with young Emmy Rossum as Christine Daae. Not only is she the right age for the part. A young chorus girl who suddenly has this beautiful voice. Although I enjoyed Sarah Brightman's original Christine, Emmy Rossum was delightful. As a teenager, she has such a beautiful clear voice that is much better than most of the vocal performance majors I know. As a child, she was a part of the children's opera chorus and has obviously had extensive vocal training. She can clear Christine's very extensive vocal range with absolutely no problem.Her voice is so pure that it reflects the pure innocent Christine she portrays on screen. Not only that, but she makes a beautiful Christine and is wonderfully cast opposite Gerard Butler's sneaky,devious, Phantom. I must say I was impressed with Gerard Butler's voice as well. His baritone is wonderfully rich and makes the melodies just as expressive as Michael Crawford's tenor. The cinematography is beautiful, for the film looks like a giant stage play. The colors are bright and vivacious and dark an mysterious. The costumes are beautiful, although I was disappointed at the scaling down of the Phantom's red death costume at the masquerade ball. But it does provide a wonderfully stark contrast against the black and white costumes of the party goers.	5.0	The phantom of the opera is there... inside my mind	2005-01-27	7	5	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2VCAU3W7AODL1	Marie Fleurette	I will never thank enough the person who gave me the DVD as a gift! As an avid fan of Gaston Leroux's work, I was a bit apprehensive regarding this version. I don't think I have ever been happier to be so utterly wrong! Patrick Watson (Raoul) is a delightful lyrical tenor and makes a great romantic lead, while Emmy Rossum is the definitive Christine (sorry Ms. Brightman, I adore you but Rossum was perfectly cast), she conveys the perfect mix of purity, youth and innocence and comes of age right before our eyes. Brilliant. But my main appreciation has to go to Gerard Butler (the Phantom), who makes us feel his pain very keenly. You empathize with him big time. I was totally blown away by his ability to convey so much emotion while signing. Whoever made the final decision to cast him instead of a trained singer deserves all my admiration. It was a gutsy move, but a very brilliant one. He delivered every single note to perfection in terms of emotion and of vocal performance. He creates the perfect contrast with Watson and Rossum (intense and passionate compared to lyrical and romantic). &quot;The Point Of No Return&quot; is a particularly poignant number. Supporting actors are also very well cast and provide an interesting comic relief to the drama that unfolds, particularly in the case of Minnie Driver, Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow. I highly recommend this DVD to everyone. You don't even have to be crazy about musicals to appreciate it.	5.0	Enchanting!	2005-05-26	6	5	1

Gerard Butler protrays  ""Erik"" the phantoms role spectaculerly, for one who has never had a singing lession, his voice is soo spellbinding its scary. Emmy Rossum, the beautiful Christine Daae simply glows in her role, her outstanding singing for an 18, year old, really shows. she is soo mature and lovely, any man would want to fall in love with her. Patrick Wilson really brings out raouls charactor, he is handsome and dashing its no wonder all the girls want him.The whole story is beautiful and scary and soo full of passion, the costumes, the set designes, are all increaible, erik and christines tragic love brings out how much you can learn to love those who are different an not ugly. its whats inside that counts.i recommand that everyone who is anyone to pick this outstanding movie up, based on Gaston Leroux's beloved tragic  novel, after you hear this movie, i garantee you will be hearing Erik's music forever. an if you read the book the spirit of the real phantom will guide you an protect you like he was your guardian angel.In 19O1 a hidden chamber was discovered  under Paris and in that chamber was a fernished room, and in the middle if it was the skeleton of the phantom of the opera Erik himself wearing a simple gold ring. what happand after that is a mystery.  This is a true event i am not joking.to close off this is a real tale, facts and all based on the real phantom of the opera who lived many years ago in paris under the real opera house. if you want to find erik's lair go to Paris and start the search! adeiu!"	5.0	THE GREATEST TRAGIC TRUE STORY EVER TOLD!	2011-06-19	2	1	1

Phantom brings you the things you've always looked for in a film, from romance to charm to excitement to sorrow.While I don't like the fact that Joel Schumacher- of all people- directed it, I think the magic of the musical is still within itself, soaring above all other films at the theater. The few flaws include the small changes in between shots of the same scene, as well as a few singing slips, but the instrumentals cover it all so that you can't even notice it...I especially enjoyed the music in ""All I Ask of You"", which takes you back to the classic movies in it's orchestra phenomenon. I also loved ""Masquerade"" as it enthralls you in happiness and wonder, and the lyrics of ""The Music of the Night"", which sent chills down my spine.The honest truth is that 'Phantom' is not the thing you have the chance to see every day.

I read through some of the reveiws and there seems to be some misconceptions on what musicals are all about.1.  A musical means music, don't complain that there is to much music.  That's the way it's suppose to be. I you don't like musicals pdon not watch this as you will hate it.2.  This is not real, it didn't happen, it's a figment of someone's imagination.  Everything doesn't need to make perfect sense.3.  Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightmann are to old to play the Phantom and Christine.  Get over it.4.  Suspend your belief, sit back and enjoy.As a long time POTO fan, I resisted seeing this movie as I thought it couldn't  do the stage play justice.  I am happy to admit I was wrong.  You just have to remember that the stage show was a stage show and this is movie.  They are different forms of the same story.In this version Gerard Butler plays a younger, sexier version of the Phantom.  I would guess woman 9 to 90 will fall in love with him, I know I did. His voice is different from Michael Crawfords, and not in a bad way.  I grew to really like his voice, it fits his personality.Emmy Rossum as Christine is lovely, innocent and niave as she should be.

If you are planning to own the movie, have it in blu-ray.Aside from the well known picture quality differences between DVD and the blu-ray, this disc includes special features that must be close to two hours. From how this phantom project got started, to the casting of the crew, to showing all the team members (singing to the tune of the phantom), these special features simply help complete the story.I LOVE the original musical, this movie version only adds to it. Of course, movies are not as intimate as watching live theatre, however, the camera angles, the visual effects, the costume all makes this a really nice movie to own.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2AK6S22CB56JY	Marion G.	My favourite movie for the past 20+ years has been Ladyhawke and I never thought another movie would ever replace it.  Was I wrong.  Phantom of the Opera is the most amazing movie I've ever seen.  I saw the stage version 12 years ago and loved it but the movie is so much better, I think due to the fact that there is so much more that can be portrayed on film as opposed to on the stage.  I only wish I had seen it in the theatre.Gerard Butler-what can I say except the man is one of the most amazingly talented actors around.  The emotion he portrays in Phantom is heart-wrenching-he made me feel everything he was feeling.  His singing voice is incredible considering he's not a trained singer. I love the rock and roll edge he brings to it. And mercy, he's so handsome and utterly sexy. Perfect in every way.I thought Emmy Rossum was wonderful.  So much talent for someone so young. I'm sooo envious.Patrick Wilson is also good but I must admit there is NO WAY I would have picked him over Gerard Butler.I really enjoyed Minnie Driver's performance.  She's wonderful as Carlotta and injects humour into her role.The entire cast, music, settings are everything that is good in a movie.My only complaint is that it was over way to soon to suit me.  I was totally enthralled.	5.0	Riveting and emotional	2006-01-29	20	19	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3LQOU49QZQS0X	Marisela Granada	This was the most well- done, outstanding, wonderful, stupendous, amazing musical I have ever seen. The music is breathtakingly beautiful and flows together masterfully. The story line is riveting and keeps you glued to your seat. Christine's struggle between her two loves seems real; you can feel the Phantom's passion for Christine, his pain in her rejection, and his longing for love. This is the only musical ever that has made me cry. I loved it and I believe you will, too.	5.0	The Best Musical I Have Ever Seen	2005-09-11	3	2	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	"There is a legend surrounding the old opera house in Paris.  The story goes that some creature lives downstairs demanding things of its owner.  They must pay him rent and star his protegee, Christine.  But as the Phantom is finally showing himself to Christine, she is falling for another man.  And the new owners think they don't have to listen to the Phantom.  These events will force the Phantom to take action and his true nature to be seen by all.I've only seen the stage play once, so I went into this movie with very little expectations and no baggage.  I was very impressed.  There is a jaw dropping scene as we first move from the ""modern"" era black and white to the color setting of the story.  The costumes and sets are fantastic, bring the story to life in a way not possible on stage.  Yes, events from the play occur in different orders, but over all, the story is still preserved.  The music, including the new song, is still outstanding.So what's my complaint?  It's the same one I have with the stage version.  The Phantom is made out to be sympathetic.  This is even truer here as we see his past as a little boy.  The problem is he's an evil man whose true nature comes out the more people stand up to him.  I realize I'm alone in not enjoying this glorification.  At least he does realize how bad his behavior has been near the end.Overall, this is a wonderful musical brought to life beautifully on screen.  Stage purists won't like it, but the rest of us will be able to enjoy this outstanding musical."	4.0	Surrender to the Music of the Night	2005-05-18	8	2	6
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A19N6E6NFH4L9D	"Mark Carter ""hawnyawk"""	"I really don't like musicals, so I'm still wondering why I got this DVD (other than the poor selection of movies and the video store).  I watched this movie with a hair trigger finger on the stop button, but I made it through and I'm glad I did. The movie has many hooks, the music and a diverse plot will keep you interested, and almost fascinated that you are enjoying a musical.  The ""Andrew Lloyd Webber"" music will seem drab at first, but once you get the hooks, it's like a 80's song that can't get out of your head.  The cinematography is beautiful, it's like watching a weird nightmare on your television, black and white, color, both, I can't stand it any more, this movie is really freaking me out.  Stick with it, there will be times that your attention will wonder, but in the end the movie delivers both a treat for the eye and ear that you will not soon forget."	4.0	Don't like musicals	2005-06-05	6	3	3

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A110LO9AG0AV65	Mark Jones	I didn't think it could be done-the magic of Phantom captured on film. Schumacher pulls it off. The overture rings deep in your soul and causes your spine to tingle. The Phantom of The Opera song causes your imagination to soar higher than the Himalayas. Gerard Butler as the Phantom brings a deep, guttural soul to the angst driven character. Emmy Rossum has the angelic, mystical quality to take Christine straight to your heart.Schumacher's sequencing between past and present with the switch to grainy black and white gives the movie a vital quality which captures the faded glory of the era and the opera house.Not a lot that more that can be said-it is a movie and a musical that must be experienced.	5.0	Superb, sublime, inspiring	2005-06-25	2	2	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3UTU0909C2WC6	Mark O'Connor	"This is perhaps one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, and I am far from one to exaggerate. It is lush and sumptuous, with breathtaking orchestrations and vocals. I was blown away by the sheer talent of the entire cast, especially the leads. Emmy Rossum gives the perfect performance; her Christine is just how she should be innocent and naive, beautiful and talented. As Carlotta asks right before Prima Donna, ""Would you not rather have your precious little ing&eacute;nue?"" and the answer is, yes, we would. What Gerard Buttler lacks in vocal training and experience (though the range and power of his voice is impressive), he makes up in the sheer ability to emote so beautifully in every word he sings. As his heart breaks, yours breaks with him, and at times you sympathize with his Phantom. Patrick Wilson is a wonderful Raoul with the essential amounts of charm, sophistication, and heroism. From what I've heard he took a character that is usually not liked and made him loved. Minnie Driver as Carlotta steals every scene she is in, even though she does not sing, she is hugely enjoyable.The music alone is reason enough to buy this DVD, because accompanied with the visuals (the sets are stunning, perfect for a movie based on a stage musical, there is the perfect flare of theatrics to them) of the movie, the music is even better. The spectacular orchestration are breathtaking, especially when you hear the overture for the first time, you will be floored. The songs themselves are at times exciting and enjoyable, romantic and loving, and heartbreaking and sad, a wonderful range. Particular favorites of mine are ""All I Ask of You"" sung by Raoul and Christine, a beautiful love song, perhaps my favorite of any musical love songs; ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" is a haunting song sung by Christine about her father, I defy anyone who has lost someone to not be affected by this song; finally ""The Point of No Return"" is not only Gerard Butler's best performance vocally in the movie, but it is a stirring and powerful song preparing us for the movie's spectacular (and heartbreaking) conclusion.I was so moved by this film that the day after I saw it, I went out and bought the soundtrack and this Special Edition DVD. Do yourselves a favor and follow in my footsteps, you won't regret it. I recommend that you by this special edition, because it is only a few dollars more, and comes with two wonderful hour long documentaries about the origins of the stage musical and the making of the movie. There is also a deleted scene featuring the original version of ""Learn to Be Lonely"" (sung by Minnie Driver on the soundtrack) called ""No One Would Listen"" sung by the Phantom. I wish that they had kept it in the film. Finally, if you keep scrolling down on the menu, you will find a highly enjoyable Easter Egg.Buy this, I've been disappointed when people have over-hyped films for me, but I can't say enough about this film. It is moving, riveting, and beautiful."	5.0	Beautiful	2005-05-25	13	11	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ACJLSEG06DL6J	"Mary Beth Jones ""teh BOSS"""	I have loved the story of the Phantom since I was a child.  I have seen Tony Richardson's 1999 adaptation and Universal's 1943 Technicolor film (Susannah Foster & Nelson Eddy).  There are also two silent films- Universal's 1923 b/w version and Delta's 1925 b/w version recently out in DVD.Joel Schumacher's movie theatre version is, by far, the grandest of its kind.  The staging is lavish, the costuming is gorgeous, the acting is consumate, and the voices are heavenly.  Long after the credits have run, Andrew Lloyd Weber's songs linger in your mind.  Emmy Rossum's Christine is perfect, for in the original book, she was a young teen woman. Gerard Butler was menacing and brooding, but not as grotesque as in the orginals/book.  Patrick Wilson played Raoul well, but his part is not a spine-tingling heroic one.  Minnie Driver's Carlotta is over the top, a bit overdone.  All other principal characters are well played.This version of The Phantom captures the grandeur often lost in a retelling of this story.  Since the story is different from pervious versions as well as from the stage version and the book, it stands in a category all its own.  It is beautiful, magnificent, and well worth the investment for your video library!	5.0	Breathtaking, Grande!	2005-10-03	2	1	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1LH1J87PJMTCO	Mary Schaeffer	About fourteen years ago, I took my two small granddaughters to see the stage play of the Phantom.  The youngest being only two, I thought it wouldn't make a big impression on her but through the years they listened to the music, talked about the stage show constantly and pretended to be Christine.  My greatest hope was that someday Andrew Lloyd Webber would transfer this touching story to the screen.  I waited patiently and my patience was rewarded!  For the first time, I own my own copy of this beautiful movie which was perfectly cast in my opinion.  I took the girls and their 7 year old younger sister to see the movie and the youngest's only request was that she could have the music CD for her own.  I not only suprised her with it for Easter this year but for her birthday, I surprised her with her own DVD of the movie.  She watches it everyday and her sister's have to bargain with her to see the movie again!  What a great accomplishment!  Thanks, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher, and not to mention the entire cast who brought my dream to the screen for me to watch over and over.  I truly appreciate it!	5.0	Long wait well worth it!	2005-05-23	3	2	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3QUEM7I1XISXY	Mary Stewart	"This movie is what sheer entertainment is all about. Joel Schumacher is a genius when it comes to casting and production. Gerard Butler's performance was breathtaking and commanding. He brought the Phantom to life and gave him a soul.  The chemistry between The Phantom and Christine was electrifying especially during ""Point of No Return""....the look on Raoul's face and the tears in his eyes couldn't have been staged. I found myself hoping Christine would choose the Phantom. No stage version could ever match the raw emotion of the last scene in the cave...the gesture of Christine putting the ring on her finger and kissing the Phantom was cathartic. The great movies like this allow me to feel the passion, pain, and love along with the actors. I'm so glad such a wonderful play was made into a powerful, beautiful movie, because now I can have the ""Angel of Music"" in my mind with the click of a button."	5.0	The Angel of Music is in my mind!!!	2005-05-23	5	3	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3U3BEZMH3F01Q	maskirovka	"I still remember with a sense of awe seeing ""Phantom of the Opera"" in London in 1992.  I'll never forget the way the Phantom appeared through the mirror to Christine and the brilliant staging of their descent into a labyrinth under the opera house.But I really found this movie impossible to watch.  The leads are all pretty or handsome and the staging is lavish.  But it just didn't ring true.  I felt that it was so very obvious that the actors and actresses weren't really singing in the moments I was watching them but were just being dubbed.This surprises me because I did like and watch the movie ""Chicago"" despite having seen and loved the musical.  Maybe it's because the movie version had some serious star power while ""Phantom"" has a bunch of unknowns.In the end, I suppose ""to each his or her own,"" but I can't help but think the movie is a pale and most inadequate copy of the musical."	2.0	It just didn't work for me	2011-07-23	4	1	3

It was colourful, the voices were so similar to the soundtrack i was impressed, the set was out of the world, the characters were incredible. Someone above mentioned that Christine looked suprised or shocked the whole time, but i have to say, she's in the stage where she's not a child, but not yet an adult - this is the first major excitement of her life! She falls in love not once, but twice; She is the Prima Donna for the opening night of Hannibal...how much more excitement could you get?I also have to say that i understand the Phantom was supposed to be older, but it does add more legitimacy to the fact that she was in love with him. It is entirely possible she could fall in love with an older man, but as she points out, his ugliness in not on the outside - it's on the inside.

He looked like he had a minor grease fire incident; not a life altering disfiguration... Only quip.	5.0	Great presentation of a classic Broadway performance	2013-08-09	0	0	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	APFQUD7VGAEDY	Matthew DeVore	This one blew me away.  The way in which it was done felt more like watching an actual movie as oppose to just seeing another play up close.  And Gerard Butler; for someone who has had no voice-training and a Scottish accent, you'd never know it and he brings in just the right amount of emotion to the character of the Phantom.  In my honest opinion, they could have left out one of the many times Christine told of her father's promise of an angel of music watching over her (was repeated almost four times) and kept the deleted scene of the Phantom singing, 'No One Would Listen' in as I think it would have really added that extra something to the storyline, but then they didn't ask me.  Still, I would highly recommend this one to any Phantom of the Opera fan.	5.0	Whoa!	2013-04-07	0	0	0

The love scene on the roof top is one of the best I've ever seen as was the trip down into the Phantoms lair.  I took all my grandaughters to see it and they loved it too.  I would recommend to anyone.  I have a 2 disc collectors edition  that has never been opened, it's my backup copy for when I wear the other one out.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3JNZLSNX3E920	M. D'Amico	"My husband and I saw the musical in October of 1995 and again in January of 1999. We also purchased the original soundtrack after we saw the musical in 1995 because we loved the music. When my husband saw that it was coming to the movies, he insisted that we go see it. I was hesitant to go see it because I did not think that it would meet my expectations of the musical. Boy, was I wrong. I loved Emmy Rossum she was cast perfectly for the role of Christine. Patrick Wilson brought the part of Raoul to new heights he was fantastic. I have heard many versions of the song, ""All I Ask of You"" but I think that Rossum and Wilson's version has unsurpassed them all.  Gerard Butler is breathtaking as the Phantom.  He was charismatic and handsome.  As far as his singing, Butler is not a professional singer and he was given only a certain amount to time to learn how to sing operatic material with that in mind I think that he did a first-rate job.  Minnie Driver brought comic genius to the role of Charlotta.  Miranda Richardson was exceptional in the part of Madam Giry.  After I saw the movie, I was once again in awe and I could not get the music out of my head for weeks.  Last week, I finally got to hear the closing song, ""Learn to be Lonely"" performed by Minnie Driver. The song touched me and it really made feel for the Phantom and his solitude.  If the movie is still playing in your area, please do not hesitate to go see it.  As they sing it in the movie, ""Let the spectacle astound you""!"	5.0	Breathtaking and a Delight to See	2005-02-25	4	2	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AW24ODXPY9CMI	"M. DETWILER ""fairval4"""	"The Phantom of the Opera is a beautiful movie.  From the beginning auction sequence that pulls you in to the last scene at Christine's grave, you don't want this movie to end.  I have always been a fan of the music and when I saw the trailer for the movie on TV before Christmas, I was eagerly awaiting this version.  I have to say I was a little disappointed in the lack of publicity for the movie.  I believe the studio must have spent the advertising money on Million Dollar Baby, but that's another story.It is rare in a movie to find that all the characters click and are likable.  For me that happened in Pirates of the Caribbean and it happened big time in POTO.  I thought all the characters were great.  Emmy Rossum has taken a lot of criticism for being sort of blank and having a deer in the headlights look.  I think she was just reacting as most women would when in the presence of Gerard Butler as the Phantom.  He seems to elicit a jaw dropping reaction in most women who have seen the movie.  I think Christine and the Phantom had a tremendous amount of chemistry together and you can see why she was really torn and had such a hard time deciding between Raoul and Erik.  Emmy Rossum's voice was just perfect for this role and she was very pleasant to listen to. (both in the movie and on the soundtrack).  Gerard Butler is an actor who can sing and I think he did a great job.  You could see every emotion the Phantom was feeling and really sympathised with him at the end. I wanted to stand up and say, ""The End"", after the kiss.  I almost thought Christine was coming to her senses and staying with him when she came back to give him her ring.  Silly girl.  I think his Phantom will become the standard all future Phantoms are measured by.  For me, he was a much more intense, passionate Phantom than others in that role.  He was the object of everyone's attention, whether he was onscreen or not.Patrick Wilson did a great job as Raoul, which is pretty much a go-nowhere role.  He has a lovely voice and ""Say You Love Me"" was one of the prettiest songs in the movie.  I really didn't like his hair, though!The supporting actors were outstanding.  Miranda Richardson and Jennifer Ellison looked alike and were believable as mother and daughter.  Miranda R. really displayed anguish over the fate of the little boy she had rescued and the man she had protected.  Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow nearly stole the show as the ""two fools"" who ran the Phantom's theatre.  I loved the maestro and his little ""You're fired"" and ""Bravo"".  It was nice to see the woman who dubbed Minnie Driver's voice, especially in Il Muto.This brings me to Minnie Driver and what I feel was an outstanding job.  She took an over-the-hill diva and embued her with likability even while she was a pain.  She was a pleasure to watch.  I especially liked her trying to hit Christine with her mask in ""Masquerade"".  I am disappointed that Ms. Driver will not be singing ""Learn to Be Lonely"" at the Oscars.  Do we really need Beyonce to sing another song???This movie has generated a lot of fan reaction and will probably give several of the actors (particularly GB, who has Dear Frankie coming out shortly) a career boost.  Most people who have liked it have seen it multiple times and non-music people are even listening to the soundtrack.  It wasn't all the critic's cup of tea, but a lot of people have found real pleasure in this lovely movie.That DVD can't get here soon enough.  I wish there were more than just 2 discs, though!  How about 4 or 5??  I'm sure there were lots of deleted Phantom scenes!!!"	5.0	Hurry up, DVD!	2005-02-24	10	8	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A8FZLHJR284TM	MeggGriffin	Phantom of the Opera on stage is my favorite musical. I have seen it multiple times since i was 12 and love it. So when the movie came out, I was more than eagered to see it.The first time you watch this movie it is magical. It takes the stage production and gives more depth to the story. The costumes and stages are nothing short of beautiful. I believe Christine and the Phantom where casted well, along with most of the other cast, but I did not agree with Raoul. He always looked ready to cry and extremely weak to my likings.I bought the DVD when it came out and sat down to watch it again. As I watched it, something was bugging me. PArts of the movie did not line up with the actual musical. I haven't read the book yet, so maybe it lines up with the book? About have way into the movie I got a little bored. I am not easily bored with movies- heck I even work at a movie theatre! But the movie just seems to lose its edge in the middle. The ending is still great- minus the chandaler being dropped in the wrong spot (that bugs me the most!)All in all, I recommend this movie, but it might be disappointing.	3.0	Boring at points?	2006-07-03	2	2	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AT8QGLS86F0P	"Melisande ""opera diva-in-training"""	As a big fan of the musical, I was thrilled to buy a ticket for the movie.  Several hours later, I was wishing I'd gone back to New York to see it on stage again.  Phantom may be the most sumptuous film I've ever seen.  The costumes were fantastic; the scenery was amazing!  As a series of pictures it's unbeatable.  But a movie is more than a series of pictures, and that's where Phantom runs into trouble.  Simply put, Emmy Rossum is not equal to the task of Christine.  Her singing voice is thin, and the high notes are courtesy of an editing board, not her.  As an actress she has one expression - vacant.  Christine Daae isn't exactly Medea, but one would hope for something more than a vapid twit, which is how she comes across.  It does make her a perfect girlfriend for Raoul, who also seems like an empty-headed twerp.  Gerard Butler is a hot phantom, but vocally is not up to his predecessors in the role.  Also, can anyone explain why his hair is dark, glossy black until his mask comes off, at which point it changes to mousy brown?  Where was the continuity person?  Minnie Driver was the highlight of the film for me.  They wisely dubbed her voice (what a real opera singer sounds like!), and her acting is deliciously over-the-top, the way a diva should be.All in all, I told people to check it out because it is so pretty to look at, but I also warned them not to have high expectations for the acting and singing or they would be very disappointed.  With all the amazing singers out there, Andrew Lloyd Webber could've done better in casting this film.	3.0	Pretty to look at, but that's all	2005-02-22	9	2	7
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1W2CSROB79BI9	Melissa A. Breidegam	I saw the broadway play a couple of months ago in New York and it was a dream come true, I have wanted to see the Phantom since I was in the 6th grade and I am now a in my last year of college. I loved the play and the music. I was worried about this wonderful play coming onto the big screen because Hollywood always has a way of messing things up. But I went to see the movie and that was about a week ago and I just can't stop talking about it, I mean it was such a wonderful and romantic movie that it put me to tears. I know that alot of people don't like the Phantom because of the style of his singing but I LOVED HIM!!! He was sexy and in the movie he showed so much love for Christen that is was mind blowing. In my opion you can't compare the broadway singers to the ones in the movies. Its not far. If you give this movie a chance you will see that it is one of the best love stories out there. I love this movie and I love the soundtrack.

I cannot believe that this movie didn't sweep the Academy Awards, particularly having seen other movies that are nominated and been counseled not to see others!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ATYVKOM0KZ8F9	Melissa Sanchez	Ok. I really hate when people do this, but I have to say that this movie is NOT what it's cracked up to be. I love the music to the movie and was excited to see it, but my excitment wore off quickly. The movie starts with a black and white prologue which I thought fit very well. I've seen the play version, and because they can't do that onstage, I thought that this was a good effect for the movie. As the movie travels back in time to where our story begins, the theatre morphs into a beautifully colored theatre. It was a good choice. They used the computer graphics well here. The plot begins to move along and we are then introduced to Christine. I thought that she was a pretty girl and seemed to fit the role. Then, she began to sing. What came out though, was not at all what I expected. The entire time I was cringing because she was desperatly trying to hit those notes which  she doesnt seem able to hit very well. Because this is an opera, I was expecting an opera. That is not how she sang. She had a pretty voice but it she wasnt strong enough to play an opera singer. Her voice was trained for more of modern genre of singing. When the Phantom comes in to her world and takes her to his cave, I was excited. My favorite song was coming up. Again, disapointed. His voice was extremely too modern for this type of music. It is an OPERA. The actress playing Meg had the best voice in the film. I suggest they should have put a curly wig on her and made her Christine. One last problem with the film is that they overly produced this film. Everything they shot was trying to so pretty and beautiful, but didnt concentrate on any other part of the film. When riding in the boat to the Phantom's cave, it was so bright and colorful and didnt match with what the mood was. This part is very entrancing and needed to be more mysterious and dark. What just thought was hilarious, is how when Christine crosses over into the Phantom's world, she turns into a whore. All of the sudden she has A LOT more make-up on, her boobs are pushed to her chin, and she was showing a lot of leg. To me, this movie created an ok atmosphere for some parts, but for the rest were way too modern. If you are looking for a very modern overly produced, overly hyped movie, then this is for you. Maybe the fact that I had seen it before is the reason I discovered all of these flaws. But I was very little...maybe 7 when I first saw it, so I'm not going to blame it on that. You can think what you want, but I've said my peace. Not at all what I expected. Don't expect too much.	2.0	What is everyone thinking?	2005-04-29	19	8	11
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2NNICOD9HA15H	Meredith L.	"A beautiful take on a Broadway classic.  I've never seen the Broadway show, but can't imagine it being any better than this.  The scenery, costumes, grandeur...all exquisite.  The 105-piece orchestra takes the music to a new level of beauty(""The Music of the Night"" is particularly gorgeous at the end), combined with the beautiful vocals; a stunning experience.Emmy Rossum, gives a spectacular performance as Christine.  Her singing is absolutely beautiful, and she effortlessly conveys the innocence and sweetness of Christine.  Priceless is the expression on her face whenever she's around the Phantom, a combination of desire and intrigue that only he can bring out in her.Gerard Butler, as the Phantom, quite literally steals the show.  His voice is powerful, highly emotional, and a little unpredictable, which suits our hero perfectly.  In this movie, he's the hero, hands down.  Charismatic, sexy and incredibly suave, Butler leaves us desperately wanting see Christine give in to her obvious attraction to the Phantom (preferably with juicy details for us), even AFTER he murders a couple of cast members and nearly destroys the entire opera house (you'll forget about that stuff almost as quickly as it happens), even AFTER his mask comes off (it's not pretty, but he's so intoxicating, we don't care).  And his performance at the end of the movie will break your heart.The chemistry between the Phantom and Christine is sizzling.  Their scenes together, from the time the Phantom first takes her hand as her leads her to his underground dwelling, to their scorching duet in ""The Point of No Return,"" are the hottest, sexiest moments I have seen in a movie this year.Raoul, played by Patrick Wilson, serves his part well.  He's cute, in a 17th-century sort of way, and his voice is phenomenal, flawless, perfect.  He's dull, but that's the whole point.  This ain't his movie, and we don't want him and Christine together anyway.  Still, we never doubt his love for her, as bland as that love may be.  Christine, too, is a little expressionless while she's around Raoul, but that's to be expected as well.  He doesn't bring out the passion in her like the Phantom does.My only complaint(besides craving the opposite ending): I wanted to see more!  I would have loved to see another scene with Christine and the Phantom, to see their characters filled out a little more.  There are a lot of ways to interpret this movie, and some missing information that you can fill in for yourself.  Beautiful, tragic, and haunting...you will cry at the end...and watch it over and over."	4.0	"An incredible movie that is now stuck ""inside my mind""!"	2005-08-17	3	3	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2657JOP19CB6C	"M. Fife ""Angel of Music"""	I have to agree that I LOVED the movie for many many reasons, but the singing was not one of them.  So, for all you who appreciate good music, don't get your hopes up too much.  Here's a breakdown of the voices.Emmy Rossum- Her voice definitely has POTENTIAL, but it is no where near as polished as it should have been to play the role of Christine.  Yes, I know the character of Christine was young, but she was supposed to have this absolutely AMAZING voice.  Miss Rossum has a nice voice for a teenager, but not incredible.  It was quite breathy in instances as well as pinched and shallow in other areas.  She also wimped out on higher notes...letting her voice go into a shallow bell tone with no presence behind it.  And what is up with the sliding?  Overall, plesant voice but not as high caliber as Christine needed to be.Patrick Wilson- What can I say? I don't think they could have chosen a better voice for Raoul.  Now, his acting wasn't really great, but his voice was breathtaking.  Sure, he had a few notes a bit out of tune and a couple of his vowels were weird, but overall, he had the best musical theater voice in the cast.  Pure tone, consistent vibrato and a pleasure to listen to.Gerry Butler- Well, Gerry, as beautiful as you are and as wonderful as an actor as you are, you definitely needed a few more years of voice lessons before doing this show.  I think Gerry has potential to become a good singer, but you can tell he just wasn't trained or had very little training.  He didn't quite have the breath support to finish his phrases and the tone was inconsistent.  There was also quite a bit out of tune and very little or no vibrato.  His years of smoking probably have something to do with his breathing and tone, but overall, don't expect too much from his voice.  Just not Phatom caliber.  He is a pleasure to look at though. :)Carlotta (dubbed voice) - I don't know the name of the soprano who sang Carlotta's role, but DANG...that woman can SING!  Yes it was overly dramatized and a bit piercing at times, but hey, that's her character.  Definitely the most trained singer in the bunch and most consitent.  She could outsing anyone in the cast by far.  You go girl!!	4.0	Take it from a trained musician....	2005-04-22	10	5	5
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2LM1QSNEU2VTH	M. Gisin	"Five minutes into the film, I thought to myself, ""I must buy this when it's released to DVD.""  The actors indeed did their job...they ACTED beautifully in their parts.  While Butler may not have Crawford's ""range"", he was beautiful in a painful way and acted in the tormented manner his shell portrayed.  The actress who portrays Christine was magnificient and definitely appeared torn several times when trying to choose between The Phantom and Raoul (and I'm thrilled she's been recognized by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for 2005's Golden Globes).  The sets are a joy to behold and, I believe, meant to be ""overdone"".  The only ""downer"" was Minnie Driver's overacting, which was a turnoff.  She looked like she was trying too hard to be the intolerant diva replaced by Christine.  Director's techniques?? I especially liked the transition between modern day and ""Phantom"" day...Having seen the play twice, I always wondered what happened to the Phantom....and now the audience is allowed to see.  He was ""there"" for Christine in the end, as Raoul was.As a child of the '50s, I grew up on musicals....why, oh why, has it taken 50 years for Hollywood to come up with a decent musical.  This film is nothing less than enchanting and the perfect holiday gift from Hollywood."	4.0	This Film DOES NOT disappoint	2004-12-26	3	3	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1UYNO24EXETXE	M. G ORELL	"Yes, I know the last exclamation mark is a 1This film has taken its place among my top 3 favorite movies, the first 2 being The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the first Pirates of the Carribean movie (they're making a sequel).First, let's talk about the music. The music is brought to the grand scale that Andrew Lloyd Webber had always dreamed of, now that it is being played by a full orchestra and not a pit band.The production design is extraordinary. I was rooting for the art department to win the Oscar for Best Art Direction. The grand scale of the stage show has been elevated to new heights.The treatment of the show itself is excellent. I loved the added touches of backstory and action and mystery. I personally preferred the sword fight in the cemetary because it works better on film than what actually happens on stage (the Phantom throws fireballs.) I also love how Schumacher gave the characters of Madame Giry and Joseph Buquet so much more to do than in the stage version. Frankly, they're just throwaway characters in the stage version but in the movie, we realize what Buquet is all about and we get to see that Madame Giry had a more vital role to play in the Phantom's life.Now for the cast:Emmy Rossum has the voice of an angel and is perfect for the part. She's the right age and has a young, crystalline voice.Gerard Butler as the Phantom. I don't agree that his singing voice is the best in the world. I know he's not really a trained singer but they could have trained him just a tad harder. Then again, Schumacher did not want a pretty voice for the Phantom. So, I forgive him. To tell the truth, his voice isn't that bad.Patrick Wilson has vocal chords made of gold, which is only right since he has done Broadway. He is perfect as the dashing, romantic, swashbuckling, and somewhat wimpy Raoul.Minnie Driver is hysterical as La Carlotta (I 'ATE MY 'AT!!!!)It's a pity that she's not really an opera singer.Miranda Richardson has an ok singing voice. She also puts on a convincing French accent. I've noticed that Madame Giry is normally the only member of the cast who has to do a French accent. She's less of a throwaway in the movie than in the stage version and more of a driving force. We see that she truly cares about Meg and Christine. So when the new managers are checking the two out, she's like, ""Don't even think about it!""Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds (pronounced KEE-ran HINDS; long I) are hysterical as the two managers (this never happened in the junk business; scrap metal!)I feel that Simon Callow's singing voice rivals Ciaran Hinds by far.Jennifer Ellison is a little delight as Meg Giry. And she's the first Meg I've ever heard who can sing. She's so petite and adorable that I thought Kristen Chenoweth was playing the part!Victor McGuire as Piangi is wonderfully hammy and henpecked. He has a wonderfully exaggerated tenor which gets crappy in all the right places. (Sad to return to find the la-a-a-and we love).I still don't understand why that midget was there all the time.Kevin McNally as Buquet. Well, he's better than the stage Buquet, who was a total throwaway character. At least he has more to do (like trying to catch the Ballet Girls getting dressed)The makeup on the Phantom was somewhat of a let down. It looked more like he had an encounter with acid as a young child. Then again, in the movie, it's never established that he was deformed from birth, so that may be what happened.The guy who played Monsuier Reyer was also funny (UNDERSTUDY!? There is no understudy for La Carlotta!)Just for the record, the horse in the title song is a homage to the original novel. The Phantom takes Christine to his lair on a horse.And now the special features:The featurette on the history of the musical was really cool. I especially liked the film clips of the Sydmonton production, the current production in England and clips from the music videos (the British DVD has the full, unedited music videos. Lucky dogs! Oh, well, they've had this show and Andrew Lloyd Webber longer.)The deleted song, No One Would Listen, is lovely even if it is really the first draft of Learn to Be Lonely.It's an awesome film and if the upcoming movie versions of Rent, The Producers, and Dreamgirls once again kill the movie musical which has barely been resurrected by Chicago and Moulin Rouge, this will be a reminder that this generation had its share of movie musicals. What can I say? I'm a sucker for movie musicals. I even liked Man of La Mancha."	5.0	LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1	2005-05-27	4	3	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"Based upon the French novel ""Le Fantme de L'Op&eacute;ra"" by author Gaston Leroux (1868-1927), the highly successful Broadway musical writer/composer Andrew Lloyd Webber transformed the novel into the highly successful musical ""The Phantom of the Opera"" in 1988.  Other well-known Broadway musicals that he has composed include ""Cats"" (1983), ""Evita"" (1980), ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" (1972) and ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"" (1982).  Of these, both ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and ""Evita"" were adapted to big screen films in 1973 and 1996 respectively.  In 2004, Andrew Lloyd Weber took it upon himself to produce the film adaptation of his masterful live musical ""The Phantom of Opera"".  With elaborate costumes and the same appealing music, the film earned three Oscar nominations for ""Best Art Direction"", ""Best Cinematography"" and ""Best Original Song"".Directed by Joel Schumacher (who co-wrote the screenplay with Weber), the film version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" uses a film technique that was first used in the 1939 film ""The Wizard of Oz"": the film begins in the black-and-white early twentieth century present (present for the film), then uses color to show the events of the past at the ill-fated Parisian opera house.  A young, disfigured boy (Chris Overton) had been rescued from a travelling carnival by a girl (Laura Hounsom) who worked and lived in a Parisian opera house. She hides the boy in the opera house where they each grow into adulthood, but unlike her, the grown-up Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson), he remained isolated from the rest of society.  Though very intelligent, his fears of how people will view his facial disfigurement forces him to become the secretive ""phantom"" (Gerard Butler) of the opera.  Living in the opera house encouraged a strong love of music and performance within him.  Unfortunately, he became obsessed with the notion that the opera house was his personal possession and frightened its owners (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as ""Firmin"" and Simon Callow as ""Andre"") to do his bidding.  This included forcing them to use the lesser-known performer Christine (Emmy Rossum) in place of the well-known, but egocentric diva Carlotta (Minnie Driver).  The phantom loved Christine, but she also had another suitor in Raoul (Patrick Wilson).With its elaborate sets, costumes and cinematography, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is indeed visually impressive.  Musically, the film suffers in part due to the casting of Gerard Butler whose singing is often flat and periodically struggles.  Also, as a character, the film suffers because Gerard Butler as the phantom should appear at least as old as Madame Giri (who is probably around age 50), but instead appears to be in his thirties.  This was done no doubt to make him appear more appealing to Christine (who is about 20), but in reality, he should appear to be about 25 to 30 years older than her, not 15 years.  As a live musical with impressive, live, three-dimensional special effects to dazzle audiences, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" was quite the experience; but as a two-dimensional film, the impact of those same special effects is diminished.  Consequently, with an estimated budget of $60-million, it is not surprising that the film grossed somewhat less than that in U.S. theaters at just over $51-million after showing for nearly 6 months.  As a film, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" demonstrates that a live show cannot always be adapted well to film.  My overall rating for the film is 3.5 out of 5 stars, rounded to 4 stars."	4.0	Visually Impressive, But Not As Good as Stage Performance	2005-05-18	10	6	4

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A82LIVYSX6WZ9	Michael Bolts	This time, The Phantom Of The Opera is a musical formed by the forces of both Andrew Llyod Webber and Joel Schumacher of all people. Last time anyone made Phantom Of The Opera it was a dreadful horror movie with Robert Englund. Some people loved this, thats why its up for Best Picture (Comedy or Musical) and who can blame them...the production looks fabulous...there's some wonderful actors but do we really see them act? No we see them threwout the movie moan and groan out their feelings in high and low pitched musical numbers throwing out the dialouge. At least give us Grease or The Imposters..I mean, it was like Moulin Rouge over again..it would never end. Gerard Butler's (Timeline, Reign Of Fire) Phantom wasnt that impressive...he did a much better job as Dracula. Emily Rossum is beautiful and has a nice singing voice but enough already!!! Miranda Richardson's (Spider, Sleepy Hollow) singing voice is piercingly awful and Minnie Driver (Circle Of Friends, Beautiful) is so annoying...its hard to like anyone in this movie...although I was rooting for The Phantom to kill pretty rich boy who rides white horse and weaps cuz he cant have the woman he loves. Too much drivel in my mind.....wasnt the best in my mind. I just didnt get into it that much and for me it was boring,	2.0	The Best Picture? Please...give me a break	2005-02-19	35	3	32
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	"Other than CHICAGO, movie musicals have not been abundant in the last ten years or so.  THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a joyous, breathtakingly beautiful film featuring some of Andrew Lloyd Webber's most beautiful songs (Music of the Night and All I Ask of You at the top), dazzling sets and costumes, artistic flair, and performances of superior quality.  More a love story than a horror story, THE PHANTOM sweeps onto the screen in lush colors and amazing cinematography.  Joel Schumacher, mostly known for his action thrillers, shows a deep respect for his material and takes his relatively unknown cast through the motions in glorious style.  Gerard Butler (Dracula 2000, Lara Croft Tomb Raider, Dear Frankie, Reign of Fire) is a superb Phantom.  Having to overcome the stigma of being the man who took Michael Crawford's role, Butler oozes romantic obsession, tortured self-deprecation and a swashbuckling persona.  While his vocal prowess is indeed limited, he sings with emotion and a tenderness combined with madness that is marvelous.  Emmy Rossum (Mystic River) was 16 when she filmed this movie and she is glorious.  Aside from her stunning beauty, she evokes the innocence of Christine and sings like a nightingale.  Patrick Wilson, a two time Tony nominee, is fine as the heroic Raoul, the young man who wins Christine's heart.  Their duet of All I Ask of You is dazzling.  Rounding out the cast are Minnie Driver as the over the top Carlotta, as mentioned the only performer who was dubbed musically; Miranda Richardson is perfect as the savior of the Phantom in his early years; and Simon Callow (Four Weddings and a Funeral) and Ciaran Hinds (Veronica Guerin) are superb as the two ""scarp metal"" magnates who buy the Opera house.  The film has a plethora of haunting scenes; artificial snow has never looked more gorgeous; and the graveyard scene is eloquently beautiful.THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is high class entertainment, and in time I feel it will receive more critical acclaim as it is viewed on its own merits and not compared to the stage play that gave its birth."	5.0	MUSIC OF THE NIGHT	2005-05-08	8	5	3
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AEG3I82BVE2ZK	"Michael Cornett ""Madman"""	"Of course, I'm a little prejudiced, since I think the stage musical is problematic.  On the plus side, it's got a rich, tuneful score, but on the negative, I find the lyrics to be often sappy and insipid.Nevertheless, I sat down and watched the film version.To put it in a nutshell, a big issue I have with the whole treatment here is that ALW and Joel Schumacher take Gaston Leroux's penny-dreadful gothicism and filter it through the sensibilities of a Harlequin romance novel.Emmy Rossum is, I think, one of the best casting choices in this film.  Her youth makes Christine's gullibility and naivite believable, and her voice is simply superb.  Her performance keeps Christine from seeming too much like a flighty drip.  But Gerard Butler is disastrously miscast as the Phantom, and his Erik has got to be one of the most woefully misconceived characterizations that I've seen in years.  All through the movie we hear about how hideous he is.  Even Christine sings, ""Distorted, deformed, it was hardly a face.""  And yet, when unmasked, we have an extremely handsome man with a small bumpy patch on his face that merely looks like an unpleasant skin condition.  The Phantom's unmasking is supposed to produce shock, horror, and pity...but in this film, the only emotion I felt was the desire to slip him the name of a good dermatologist.  The ball was totally dropped there, folks, and the one of the story's big climaxes was anticlimactic.  (Various wags dubbed Butler ""The Fashionably Scarred Stud of the Opera"" which is pretty dead-on...)Unfortunately, Butler's singing wasn't up to the demands of the role, and he was certainly no match for Rossum's Christine.Another problem is that the film alternates between lavishness and paucity.  The ""Masquerade"" number felt underpopulated, just a few people standing around a room watching a masked fop ""vogue.""  It was a golden opportunity to cram the screen with dancing couples, like Lubitsch's ""The Merry Widow"" or even the original Lon Chaney ""Phantom.""  Instead, a major number ends up feeling like a throwaway.  There's lavish, gorgeous sets galore, but sometimes they're just not handled right.To its credit, there are some very nice numbers; ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" is a standout.  The sets and costumes are great.  But the supporting cast ranges from the workmanlike to the wooden to the hammy.  Shifting the story from the real Palais Garnier (the setting of the original novel, and the ALW musical, from what I remember) to a fictitious opera house is puzzling, as the Palais Garnier was very much one of the stars of the original story.  And a shift in time periods serves no purpose.Ultimately, it just doesn't gel.  I've heard they downplayed the Phantom's ugliness to avoid grossing out audiences, but that was a colossal mistake, as the Phantom's ugliness is one of the major elements that drives the story, and robs Christine's eventual kiss of any drama or sense of sacrifice.  (At the very least they should have rewritten some of the lyrics and dialog so they weren't always talking about how hideous he was...when he wasn't.  And a flashback scene to a young Erik being kept in a cage and mocked for his ""deformities"" is almost insanely idiotic when the extremely minor nature of his problem is revealed; people of that time would see far worse on the streets, what with skin diseases and war injuries in a time before prosthetics.)  This is a very highly romanticized version of the story, probably done less to satisfy fans of the Leroux Phantom story and more to satisfy the ""Phans"" who want Christine to choose the Phantom over Raoul.  (Even though the Phantom is a demented, deformed mass murderer and arsonist who used, manipulated, and decieved her for a long time, regularly threatens and berates her, wallows unceasingly in self-pity and blames everything on his ugliness, demands more love and devotion than any human being can give, menaces the people she cares about, is insanely obsessive, masquerades as her dead father in order to manipulate her further, demands complete and utter control of her, and can offer her nothing in the way of a real life or career...I guess these folks view Christine as unbelievably stupid and self-destructive and think that's romantic...)"	2.0	Ill-conceived and uneven	2007-11-24	10	8	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1D69VSI3ZV9QW	Michael J. Lira	"So far, I've seen nothing but good reviews of this film. Sorry, but this isn't that kind of review. Stop reading now if you liked it, because I was absolutley appaled.I must say, that when I first heard about the film, I was both delighted and apprehensive. I was first introduced to Phantom of the Opera 7 years ago when my sister took me to a performance in San Francisco. I saw it again in London in July. After seeing it again, I was amped to see how it would translate to film. Then, a friend lent me the soundtrack, and I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It's also the reason I've put off seeing it until now. The first thing I've noticed is how much of the story has been changed and added to. For one, Madame Giry is not at the auction in the original performance, and it is Raoul who buys most of the items for sale. Though, I did like how they did the transition from the ""Present"" to the past. Another thing that was altered was the introduction of the new owners and Carlotta's departure. Raoul was never at that first meeting in the play.Another major change was the end of act 1. The chandelier was supposed to fall after the curtain falls on Il Muto (after Christine returns to perform the lead), being the biggest of the Phantom's crimes, and his attempt at forcing the owners and cast into compliance. The falling chandelier is delayed until the end, and doesn't give the same feeling. And the intro of act 2 is bad. The song ""Masquerade"" is written to reflect the costumes of the attendee's. The lyrics go: ""Flash of mauve / Splash of puce / Fool and king / Ghoul and goose / Green and black / Queen and priest / Trace of rouge / Face of beast"" and, ""Grinning yellows, spinning reds"". But, I ask you, where is all the color?? The only color seems to be from the opera's crew behinds the scenes! All the masqueraders wear variations on Black, White, and Gold! What kind of masquerade is monotone?! It the fact that many of the attendees had faces painted to resemble the Phantom seemed a bit forced. In the script for the play, it says that Christine is traded among dance partners who resemble in some way the Phantom, but never does it say they blatantly have his face! Also, what about the Phantom in that scene? His entrance isn't more than the lights dimming and a few flashbulbs instead of a grand performance as it should be for him. One thing that disappointed me was how they re-wrote the Phantom's past. Madame Giry discovered him when Meg was very young, not she herself. She's the one who freed him, he never escaped anything.As for the acting... Well, to borrow the Phantom's phrasing, it was ""a lamentable mess!"" Emmy Rossum's peformance was decent in some parts, but lacking in others. She seems much to young to fill the shoes of Christine. And Gerard Butler as the Phantom... not a great choice. For one, the Phantom is meant to be physically revolting, yet he looks like he just had some 2nd degree burns and they healed quite well.Honestly, much of the film was too contrived and forced. No one should waste their time or money on this drivel. If you want a love story, find something less gag-worthy or go see the stage performance."	1.0	"A ""Phantom"" Travesty"	2005-05-05	64	41	23

Actually, I liked the movie better because it was more colorful, more visually entertaining and grand, and the various effects available on film helped explain and reference the story with much more grace and grandeur than the limitations of a live set.I was not impressed with Gerard Butler's warbly singing voice as the phantom, but the rest of the cast was first-rate.  Emmy Rossum more than made up for his shortcomings as a wonderfully-talented Christine.  Minnie Driver was also a standout as a hilarious secondary character.Overall, it's a show of lights and sound and action that should not be missed.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A23DWPG5UMSXKF	"Michael Smith ""saintzak"""	"One star is being generous.I'm not a fan of musical theater, but many years ago I took my mother to see the stage production of Phantom of the Opera for her birthday. I remember reading a review of the show where the critic referred to Andrew Lloyd Webber as ""the Darth Vader of musical theater."" That's actually a great description, but you have to give Webber credit. He always unleashes an arsenal of catchy tunes that, for better or worse, stick in your head.  The sets and visuals were inventive, and the show  did acknowledge its over-the-top corniness in a charming way. It wasn't an unpleasant experience. My mother loved it.The movie! an absolute mess. The easiest description would be to imagine both of  Joel Schumacher's dreadful Batman films with singing. He may have been a good window dresser, but  he's a terrible film maker. The film's design and production is overblown and garish to the point of vulgar. Even if the film had been well made the disastrous casting choices would have sunk  it.  Emmy Rossum as Christine sings well, but she's a terrible actress. With her vacant, blank stare and perpetual weird smile, she seems to drift through the movie in a narcotic haze.  Patrick Wilson looks pasty and wormy as the ""hero."" Minnie Driver (too young and thin to play the opera's diva) is so annoying I wondered why they just didn't go all the way and cast Fran Drescher.  Mention ""Phantom of the Opera""  to anyone and the first thing they'll think of is Lon Chaney's iconic image.  A handsome, hunky Phantom just doesn't work at all. We see almost all of Gerard Butler's face even with the tiny mask on. Unmasked  he looks like...well he has a little skin problem. And he can't sing. He struggled badly with the dramatic moments of his songs, and I actually felt sorry for him. The music itself was another problem. I would have assumed even the stage version would have updated the arrangements. The synth-pop disco stuff sounded like something from an Ultra 80's compilation. I kept waiting for a Dead or Alive song to pop up.  It was more bombastic than anything Meatloaf has ever unleashed.What I found offensive about this film was the cynical attitude of the film makers. There was no attempt to make a good film, just an effort to ""put kiesters in the seats."" A play or stage musical has to be re-imagined for the screen. Bob Fosse  did  a brilliant job of this with Cabaret, and actually created the definative version of that show. Clearly, the objective here was to pander to the Phantom geeks (you know who you are: Phantom sweatshirt over a turtleneck, seen the show at least 8 times), and appeal to the younger Moulin Rouge crowd at the same time. Oil and water don't mix. Elements from the play were lifted out-right, but just looked cheap and stagy on screen. The frenetic fill-the-screen to limit with big sets, big props, non-stop movement drained any emotion from the characters and story. Moving the chandelier drop from the middle to end was a bad decision. It left a gaping hole in the middle of the story and was a non-event at the end when the real drama was focused elswhere. Also, the play was completely sung through with no dialogue. Adding dialogue and back stories just padded an already bloated film. Moving back and forth between singing narative and spoken made it even more chaotic and confusing. Two thirds of the way through I almost stood up and screamed, ""Stop! Please stop!""Andrew Lloyd Webber should have found a very talented, inventive director and said, ""Make my play into a great film."" Instead he hired a hack and said, ""Let's make alot of money.""  Well they'll make alot of money in the first couple of weeks, then word of mouth will kill this bomb quickly."	1.0	Ham is always served best on stage	2004-12-27	23	6	17
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3CJGHGWG2PUDM	Michael Toscano	Well, I have now seen the movie and the musical twice, and after seeing it again for the second time last night, I felt the need to share my thoughts on this film. First of all, I've been a fan of the musical for years and have been waiting for this film to hit the screen for years. And I am not sure if, it was worth-the-wait. When seeing the teaser/theatrical trailer, I was absolutly excited and shocked because it looked like the film was going to be just as effective as the musical is. I've been worried of the end result of the film since the beginning when Joel Schumacher was signed on for this project. Joel Schumacher isn't at all the best director, especially since he murdered the Batman series, and it has been said by actors that he cant direct his way out of a paper bag (by Elijah Wood). But I was pretty happy with visuals, which were quite beautiful and felt they were up to par with my perception of the story.But some of the shots and little detail in the way of his direction I found to be pretty useless and plainly bad. To this day, I personally feel I could have directed this movie better than he did (Side Note: I want to be a filmmaker) But script should have been made tighter and some parts of it were just plain useless and should have been cut to pace up the movie. Example: At the conclusion of Masquerade, the phantom disappers through fake-looking CGI fire into a trap door in the floor, where Raoul follows and tries to get the phantom but isn't sure which one is the real one, due to the mirrors. I just didnt see the point of that, and another example was the sword-fight in the graveyard. To me it just seemed to have no effect on the film or the story. And for some reason I hated that they tried as much as they could to take the story outside of the opera house (with the B&W; Flashbacks throughout the movie (except the opening)). I am not sure where I stand on the changing of positions of the chandlier falling, I did feel it was highly effective at the end. But when I first saw this film, I was just waiting and waiting for it to happen.But there are some good things in the progression of the film like the way they showed visually the reverse of time with the overture playing. And the dreamlike visuals during the theme.With the vocals, which seem to be a big topic. Well ofcourse Crawford and Brightman are the orignals and still the best ones.The vocals are ok in this film. Minnie Driver was perfect for Carlotta. Emmy Rossum was pretty good as Christine. Patrick Wilson was good as well as Raoul. But Gerard Butler, too me, isnt the best and I just didnt warm up to his voice but his acting was pretty good.But overally I recommend this film, but I highly recommend to you all to go see the musical, if you have the chance...you wont regret it	4.0	Phantom of the Opera - Could have been better !	2005-01-09	3	2	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AGLFO4XGEBAA5	"Michael Way ""critic-at-large"""	Phantom quite frankly shocked me as to how good it is.  I had planned to see it in its theatrical run but my timing would not allow. So, I saw it the first time on HBO.  The next day I ordered it from amazon and in 5.1 widescreen plasma was in a word; AWESOME.The performance by Emmy Rossum left me in a daze for days. Why? She's brilliant! Additionally her subtle beauty and magical voice lent credibility to the story and the torment of the love triangle between Chistine(Rossum), The Phantom and Raoul.  The story is extremely plausible and the performances have the ability to actually make one empathetically feel the emotion as the characters emote. Gerard Butler as The Phantom was wonderful.  His voice is not in the same class as Rossum's but his performance and acting make up in spades.Way high kudos to the roles of Firmin and Andre played respectively by Ciar&aacute;n Hinds and Simon Callow.  It's hard to believe but these guys can actually sing. They were great, funny, witty and thoroughly enjoyable.Then there's the music.  It's amazing that the same basic tune and melody can convey so much meaning in so many different scenarios.  The original cast production is better simply because there is no match for Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford.One caution however; pay attention and don't view this movie when you're tired.  Every little scene adds to the fantastic layering of the story.  If you miss this or miss that, you won't understand the delayed impact points.  For example, the story opens with an auction for a monkey-playing-cymbals music box.  It doesn't make much sense until mid movie and one really needs to understand what it represents to fully understand the power of the ending of the movie.Then there are the costumes; they're wonderful.  If you liked Baz Lurman's Moulin Rouge, then you will absolutely love this film.  Any regrets??? Yes, one. Like Casablanca, and Citizen Kane, they were made before I was born so I never saw them on the big screen.  I wished I had seen this lush film, Phantom, in a megaplex.  The small screen is great but seeing this on DVD is like seeing Titanic or Star Wars for the first time on DVD; what I'm saying is that nothing compares for certain films like a theater viewing.Last thing is the 2nd DVD. It contains wonderful scenes on the history of the film, the project and Weber's long-time collaboration with Joel Schumacher.  It is an enchanting view inside what it took to make an instant film classic.Mike Way	5.0	A Great American Film	2006-02-23	5	5	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A20LOBZWE5FU1R	"Michael West ""Michael"""	"I have seen several productions of this musical and have owned the Original Cast Recording since 1988. Yet, while I thrill to the sound of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman's incredible voices and the sight of the chandelier rising into the rafters, even I must admit that there has always been something missing from Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage version. There are many scenes (""Notes"" springs instantly to mind) that feel...well...stagy, and the story is as thin as a sheet of music. It was my hope that a film version would ""open up"" the opera house and flesh out this tale of Beauty and the Beast.I was not disappointed.Director, co-writer Joel Schumacher delivers a fully fashioned tale that embraces the spectacle of the source material and even, dare I say it, improves upon it.  Working with an all-star production team that included designer Anthony Pratt (""Excalibur""), art director John Fenner (""Raiders of the Lost Ark""), set decorator Celia Bobak (Branagh's ""Henry V"" and ""Hamlet"") and costume designer Alexandra Byrne (""Elizabeth""), Schumacher's big-screen adaptation is filled with awe-inspiring moments--yet the screenplay also serves to heighten the original material's sense of longing and loss.  Nowhere is this clearer than in the black-and-white passages the director uses to separate the acts.  Like James Cameron's Titanic, these interludes, glimpses of a dark and dreary future, serve to lament the loss of youth and the death of magic. Schumacher's script also delves deeper into the psychology of the characters: Christine believes the Phantom to be the ghost of her dead father.  Light is shed on his dark origins, and we lean much more about his connection to the strict Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson).Those who long to see Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman may criticize the casting of Gerard Butler as the (only slightly) deformed Phantom, but at 18, Emmy Rossum, Jake Gyllenhaal's girlfriend in The Day After Tomorrow, gives a star-making performance as Christine--the ballet girl who's beautiful face and voice win his admiration. Having performed in New York's Metropolitan Opera at the tender age of 7, Rossum is a phenomenal talent.  She gives the role just the right mix of emotional depth and childlike wonder.Even Webber's score seems improved.  As the power of the 100-piece orchestra explodes from every speaker, any doubts I may have had about the ability of the musical to make the leap from stage to screen are shattered.  This is what moviegoing is all about. It holds sway over the audience until the final frame, and has you thinking about it for days afterward.  Highly recommended!"	5.0	Pure Spectacle!	2005-03-02	9	7	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AW99SBGWEXP0J	Michael Zuffa	"Andrew Lloyd Webber's immensely popular musical is finally given the movie treatment, and to moderate success.  Christine (Rossum) it taking singing lessons from the Phantom (Butler) at the opera house where she is a performer.  She is still learning, but when the Phantom is done with her, she will be ready for the big time.  The Phantom, when not teaching Christine, lurks around and beneath the Opera House, hiding his scarred face.  He loves Christine, but fears her rejection.With the arrival of Raoul (Wilson), a childhood sweetheart of Christine, the Phanton finds that he has waited too long, and Christine's heart has already been taken.  The jealous Phantom of the Opera then decides to take revenge.Let me say that I am not a huge fan of musicals.  I have a problem with people spontaneously bursting into song, and that somewhat colors my review.  I found ""Moulin Rouge"" and to a lesser degree ""Chicago"", the two most recent cinematic forays into the musical, to be superior, especially in terms of songs.  Nothing stands out to me as being remarkable in ""Phantom"", although I do thing the actors try their hardest.Emily Rossum is the standout in this otherwise unknown cast.  I cannot help but think that a few bigger names might have helped things along somewhat.  Joel Schumacher, the man responsible for the downfall of the ""Batman"" franchise, crafts a beautiful looking movie.  It looks so good that I wanted to like the movie more than I did.Acknowledging that this is probably a better movie than I think, here is my qualified review: if you like the stage version of this, or musicals in general, you will enjoy ""Phanton"" quite a bit.  If you do not care for musicals, stay away.  Simple as that."	3.0	The Phantom of the Opera	2005-02-01	4	0	4

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A15A048PWP2R95	"Midwest Racing ""Adrie"""	"I have never had the opportunity to see the Broadway production of this amazing musical and I think that is to my advantage, as so many can't seem to stop comparing the two versions.  I have, however heard the original soundtrack with Brightman and Crawford.  So on that note, I found myself completely lost in the music and vocals of this movie.  Butler is an amazing voice for the Phantom.  No, he doesn't have all the finesse of Crawford, but the emotion that pours out of him is overwhelming.  You find yourself so caught up the power of his singing (""Music of the Night"" and ""Point of No Return"" for example) you completely forgive a barked or strained note or two.  I actually think that Crawford sounds very effeminate next to Butler -not a characteristic I would associate with the Phantom!  Emmy is also perfect.  As many have said, she sounds like a sweet, young, innocent girl.  Wonderful to listen to.  Wilson doesn't disappoint in any way either.As far as the actual movie is concerned, I don't think I can get enough of it.  I was totally blown away when the chandelier was raised and the opera house was restored to its former glory.  The Mirror/Phantom of the Opera scenes are gripping and mysterious.  Masquerade was a joy to watch.  The dancing was choreographed wonderfully, the entrance of the Phantom was exciting.  Nothing in the movie tops the ending scenes.  The ""final battle"" is thrilling, the singing flawless.  It's very easy to get caught up in it.  I have been moved to tears nearly every time I see the Phantom singing ""hide your face so the world will never find you...Christine, I love you.""  The pain and agony that you can see on his face is heartbreaking.This DVD is one complete package, well worth the money.  The movie is amazing, packed with love, loss, and lots of music.  The extra disk has a very cool ""making of"" feature, as well as a history of the Phantom clip (very interesting, but I felt like it was a little long and slow in some parts).  The cut scene ""No One Would Listen"" is also very, very good.  My only regret is not seeing this masterpiece in the theater!"	5.0	One of the GREATEST movies I've EVER seen!	2005-07-18	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1PTK0BXOUEQXR	Minerva Cervantes	It takes Andrew Lloyd Webber's gayest musical to gain some insight into the aging male's psyche.Yes, the phantom of the opera is about an aging male (Gerard Butler), that has a caring, nurturing, respectful woman in his life, that makes sure all his demands are met (Miranda Richardson) yet, he completely ignores her to get his hands on a much younger, prettier naivet&eacute; with the voice of an angel and the sensitivity of a peanut towards physically and emotionally scarred people.(Emmy Rossum)This is the typical  story of a forty-something guy that won't give up even when he is humiliated, and emasculated (twice) by the beautiful, angelic Christine; a story all well accompanied by the usual extra pomp and the overdone scenery that comes with every Webber production.The music and cinematography are great as to be expected, Minnie Driver is incredible at stealing most of the film, and deserves all accolades coming to her.I recommend this film if you have the patience not to get up from your seat and scream YOU IDIOT!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A34NYSFTLPY3UQ	Misha Lee	It is difficult to transform a show meant for the stage onto the silver screen, especially one that has been held in such high acclaim for so long. I am torn about the latter, because I am a long time fan of the musical and an avid theatre person. I also own the original novel and have seen several film versions of it. I was quite apprehensive, when I heard about Evita being made into a film, but it surpassed my (rather low) expectations. I know this movie has been in the works for many years and there have been ongoing debates about that along with the casting. I am one of several who are miffed that the original leads will not be again, despite the argument of their being older. Sarah Brightman does not look like she's aged 20 years and even at 62, Michael Crawford is still in good shape and as active as ever. In my opinion, the years gone by have bettered their voices. What little bit of the Phantom is seen, would be covered by makeup. Having the Phantom be so young also changes the dynamic of the story between Christine and himself. There is also an argument that they are perhaps not meant for the silver screen. Michael has spent quite a bit of time in front of cameras on sets and the years have strengthened his acting. I vaguely recall Gerard Butler in Cradle of Life, but beyond that I am not familiar with the new cast members nor their performance abilities.  They are as foreign to me as Michael and Sarah are to a lot of the population. Will I go to see the movie? After as long as it has taken to actually come to reality, yes. Whether my support for the film goes beyond that, I do not know as of yet.	3.0	Mixed feelings	2004-10-28	74	12	62

Nothing against them mind you, If Michael Crawford had taken his usual role as the Phantom i doubt whether the younger generation would have taken a second glance at it. With Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum in the lead roles there was more of an appeal to new fans.The songs are still vibrant and emotive. The sets, scenery and costumes are mindblowing!

The reveiws I have read that down grade Gerard Butlers singing are so wrong. I think Crawford has none of the emotion Butler shows.Watching it onstage can you see the expression in the eyes and the tears falling down his cheeks.Come on people,use your heads. There is no way you can see the emotion in his face the way Butler shows it to the point that your heart aches for him.As for his singing, I cannot explain the pull to the heartstrings he causes.There is just something in his deeper voice that makes it much easier to listen to if your not inclined to love opera music.Gerard Butler should have received so much more recognition from this movie. He has such capability to become whomever his character is that he must portray.There are so many people that feel the same as me that I wish there were something we could do.I feel the same about Emmy Rossum. She is outstanding and so lovely to look at.I just hope she doesn't go the way of most of the actresses today and start flaunting her body to the world.I hope I did not hurt too many feelings.This is just my opinion.	5.0	My most wonderful movie	2005-08-28	6	6	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A17CSR6WZ3TTTG	M. Michel	This has to be my most favourite film ever!!!!  I have all the versions of this wonderful story, and had the tremendous pleasure of seeing the play twice in Melbourne (Australia).This is so close to the stage play, and has the added extras and nuances that can only be captured on film.I was disappointed that Michael Crawford wasn't the phantom till I laid eyes on Gerard Butler's character, and I was lost...he is so sexy!!!!!  even after the exposure of his deformity he was still gorgeous.....his character made the insipid Raoul even more uninteresting.Emmy Rossum was just perfect,  and her performance was - I think - so much better that the short film clips I've seen of Sarah Brightman,  whose voice is superb, but presented a very blank and expressionless Christine.  Minnie Driver's Carlotta is so refreshing and a delight to watch and listen to.I watch or listen to this dvd every day, I just can't get enough of it,  and really cannot understand how anyone wouldn't love it as much as I do.  5 stars seems a very inadequate rating......	5.0	I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN THE PHANTOM!!!!!!	2005-09-01	3	2	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AMEJTGF5NQLNH	M. Miller	"then you will have to be disappointed by this film. Or if you are cynical, somewhat of a purist when it comes to movie adaptations, you will have great cause to laugh and poke fun. The movie is visually decedent in many aspects, but the singing? First of all, the phantom's modern rock star voice doesnt help the fact that he cant carry notes worth a damn. And emily whats her name who plays Christine cannot hit high soprano without wavering and pinching her voice in a cringe-worthy performance. But yes, her skimpy nightgown and sexual suggestiveness when the phantom takes her down to his lair is hilariously ridiculous. Plus the eyelid fluttering during ""point of no return""- subtlety is not an issue here. The first star was for some of the costumes and visual effects: the second? Because this film is more fun to make fun of than any of the films ever featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000"	2.0	If youve ever seen the Broadway performance...	2008-11-29	4	2	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2KM5G611CGQT4	M. Murdoch	"While I've never been to the theatre performance of this particular musical, I decided to see this film version because I thought the original story written by the French novelist would be rendered more visually detailed.My curiosity for this film was heightened when I found out that the Phantom role was played by the actor, who strongly impressed me with his outstanding acting in the role of a modern-day archeologist turned a brave and romantic medieval knight, Andre Marek, in ""Timeline.""Some musical goers criticized this film as an inferior copy of the stage format.  Actually, I was somewhat bored with the part where the new owners took over the management of the opera house and Carlotta throws a fit and quits.  But once the Phantom appeared in front of Christine, the spectacle of the music and richly evocative cinematography drew me into the magical world created by Webber and Schumacher.The real tragedy of this story is that the society was inhumanely cruel to the Phantom from his birth, and mistreated and misunderstood him only because of the deformity, forcing him to live in the dark dungeon all alone, longing for someone to love him.  So the Phantom was the real victim of the cruel fate.  This film version seems to highlight that aspect of the story more than other versions, giving it a deeper perspective on Phantom's psyche, which was genuinely interpreted and enacted by Butler.Rossum's brilliant performance as Christine really shines when she expresses her underlying attraction to Phantom, and towards the end, her sympathy and compassion for her former teacher.  To be honest, I thought this Christine looked far more attracted to the masked man with a half-deformed face than her sweetheart Raoul, and even kissed Phantom more passionately and intimately than she kissed Raoul.  That could be because, unlike the Phantom in the other versions, Butler is amazingly alluring and captivating even with the exposed prosthetic deformity on one side of his face.While Wilson has a smooth elastic voice typical of many musical singers, his Raoul seemed a little flat and lacked the passion as Christine's ardent suitor.  He actually looked a lot more like the part as an old man in the black & white images.With the exception of Christine's singing parts in opera scenes, I was not expecting any operatic singing.  So I was actually surprised by the dramatic, evocative, and convincingly plausible singing performed by Rossum and Butler.  Webber's compositions are full of intricate transitions which require singers to sing in the wide range (high to low), and to carry the dynamics and the continuity of the music and lyrics at the same time.  So just the good singing really doesn't cut it.  Both actors did their parts so well in expressing their emotions and drama through their singing in addition to their eyes and motions.  By the way, to those who sing and/or play instruments, I highly recommend the soundtrack corresponding songbook published by Hal-Leonard, which includes the chart for ""Learn To Be Lonely.""Overall, this high quality production film would entertain many of the musical fans and the movie goers."	4.0	This Phantom Has A Message!	2005-05-24	2	1	1

And was all jittery 'till it arrived.I popped it into my player and... remained speechless through the end titles.I adore Gerard Butler as the Phantom (and yes, I do have the original cats recording with Brightman and Crawford). Unlike Crawford, Gerry Butler is perfect for the Phantom. Dark, sexy, tender, loving, passionate, obsessed... oooh, baby. It made me wonder why in all the blazes Christine chose Raoul.And his voice has that nice rough sound to it, but can be so tender at times (Point of no Return - God, I wish someone would sing it to me like that). What he lacked in training, he compensated by knowing how to act, which can't be said for the original cast (they just seemed wooden).Emmy Rossum was perfect for the role of Christine. Young, vulnerable, sweet, round eyed... and a nice voice (perfect contrast to the roughness of Butler's) - 180 from Brightman...Anyway, I ADORE this movie (and I'm so thankful to have bought the CD, if not I would have never heard this movie was made - they didn't show it in my country) and have been watching it constantly over this weekend... and crying like a baby whenever Phantom sings ""Christine, I love you"".

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1FDKBSGC8YQZS	Mom of 3 boys	First let me say that if you have not read the book or seen the Broadway musical, then it is most definitely a movie you must see.If you have read the book and/or seen the musical, then it depends on your point of view.  Books, Stage Performances, and Movies are all different expressions of art - and if you're point of view is to have a new and different experience with each version, then you should enjoy this movie.  If you are going to watch the movie and compare and look for discrepancies, then why bother.It is a movie, and I would hope that my experience watching the movie would be completely different than when I read the book or watch the Broadway Musical.  And it is, a fantastically different experience.The book, for me, is a fascinating read.  I experienced pity, awe, concern, fascination, curiosity, cynical humor, and more.  While reading you always picture the people and the situations and the picture is my mind is nothing like the musical or movie.  You get to know the man who is the phantom, Eric.  I pitied the phantom, but I was not afraid of him, nor did I fall in love with him.With the musical my nerves were quite jumpy, scared, but curious at the same time. The voice of the phantom can send chills down your spine.  You strain to see into the darkest corners of the theatre, all around you, to brace yourself and prepare for HIM.  You fear him, but you yearn to see him.  Each and every time you see the stage performance.  He is truely more a Opera Ghost, The mystery captivates you and draws you to him.  So yes, I feared him and was drawn to him, but I did not love him, or pity him.With the Movie, a new experience all together.  I envied the character Christine.  Not the actress Emmy with Gerard Butler, but the character Christine with the Phantom.  You can feel the attraction and the power of the phantom.  A dark passion draws you to the phantom - and you just may fall in love with him. Or wish you were HIM.  Fantasy, romance, love and lust, despair, anguish and heartbeark.My views of Christine and Raoul were also different with each version.I love all three versions of the Phantom of the Opera, and I do not think they take away from or diminish each other.  If they did, you wouldn't want to see the musical, watch the movie, or read the book again.  All three leave me wanting to re-see, re-watch, and re-read.This is not to say that my experiences will be yours, but that if you are open to a new experience from a different version of the Phantom then you should pursue watching this movie.  If you want the book itself, as you see it in your mind, on screen...or the stage musical literally put on screen, with the hardly seen phantom, and that voice, and no changes; then that will not happen, so don't watch the movie.	5.0	A Fantastic New Experience	2005-05-13	10	9	1

It is a rich tableau of beauty, grace, chivalry, and yes, tantalizing evil. Actors Emmy Rossum of The Day After Tomorrow and Gerald Butler of Tomb Raider: the Cradle of Life, sing their roles like nightingales. I will never cease to be amazed at the versatility of talent and the quality that these actors bring to the table. The rest of the cast is of a similar calibre.Rossum is the picture of innocence and Butler that of seduction. Together, they make your hear beat faster.

The choice of taking Gerard Butler to play the Phantom was absolutely perfect, his bearing, his manliness, his age and certainly his voice. Emmy Rossum was a perfect choice for the role of Christine, sweet, innocent and very beautiful, no wonder that a man who always was so lonely would want her!  Who ever was responsible for choosing these two movie stars, did a perfect job.They could not have chosen anyone better than Gerard and Emmy. I enjoyed this movie so much that I play it over and over again.The music itself, the lyrics, the way this opera was sang, has overwelmed me so much, that I find it hard to describe in words what kind of effect it has had on me. But in short it is one of the best opera ever made, and how can this ever be topped?	5.0	phantom of the opera	2006-02-26	4	3	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y	Monkdude	I have been putting this one off and I don't know why. I saw the Broadway production back in 2001 and I really enjoyed it. I guess due to the harsh critic reviews and the fact that I thought that most actors couldn't sing these wonderful songs kept me away until today. Let me just say that the critics are way off and I would easily put this film in the top 5 I have seen last year. The first thing that stands out in this film besides the beauty of Emmy Rossum as Christine is the lavish production & set design. There is so much detail and color everywhere that you will have to watch this film again to take it all in. The two leads are great in the acting and singing department, especially Rossum (an angel's voice to go with that beautiful face) who is the standout of the group. Gerard Butler really surprised me here and made a very complex Phantom. And I must mention Minnie Driver who was very funny as Carlotta, but didn't use her real voice. Ignore the critics and look at the 5 star rating here from people like you and me. This is the best movie musical ever in my opinion and should be seen on the big screen for the sheer spectacle of it.	5.0	"I'm Glad I Just Saw ""Phantom"" Before It Leaves Theaters!"	2005-02-20	4	4	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ABNQXMPFGV5MH	monkeyshine	I have now seen this movie three times and cannot seem to get enough of it. I can't remember a time when I have felt so emotionally moved by something in the theater. I agree with  many of the other reviewers here, maybe the vocals are not laced with the experience of the stage production, but the depth of emotion and heartache conveyed by the characters, (especially the phantom) will take your breath away. I went down immediately and bought the soundtrack and that is all that has been playing in my car ever since.The second time I went, my fifteen year old son went with me. Now this is a typical, action-loving young man who goes to the movies to watch things blowing up. He said that from the moment the chandelier rose from the opera floor and the overture began playing, the hairs on his arms stood on end and stayed that way for most of the movie. I don't care what the critics say, that says something.I am trying to control myself, because I know I will be getting the DVD, but I will probably make it to the theater for a fourth helping of this musically majestic and visually enrapturing film. You just can't beat sitting in that dark theater with the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber pulsing through your veins to the beat of your heart.	5.0	This movie moved me like none other.	2005-02-19	26	26	0

I was really excited to hear about this movie but had reservations too.  Nothing will ever replace seeing this in person.The GOOD!!!!Now I do think they had (Christine and the Phantom) good chemistry and the movie wasn't a total loss.  I liked the scenery and liked the back stage action that you really don't see in the musical show.The score was great.I did like the black and white sequences - especially the ending with the rose on Christine's grave.  I was enthralled with the beginning with the illumination of the chandelier.The supporting cast was good to great.  I liked Carlotta.THE BAD!?!?!?!?!First I think the director missed the point of filming a musical.  This is not MTV so what is with the cuts every 3 to 5 seconds.  The music is so flowing that it does a great injustice to the music to be so choppy visually.Second, I am very disappointed with the Phantom.  Don't get me wrong he wasn't that bad, but the Phantom is supposed to be older - to establish a father/daughter relationship that turns into the older gentleman young maiden relationship that happens when Christine matures both in musical abilities and physically.  Also as the teacher he seduces Christine with his singing abilities.  In this movie Christine is clearly the stronger of the two so that the seduction didn't happen because of the voice but due to the ""looks"" of the younger phantom???The point of the story is that the beautiful Christine did actually fall in love with the voice of the phantom and could have looked past his disfigurement were it not for his murderous ways.  As presented in the film that was not the case.I give it 3 stars but would give it 3.5 if I could.  The movie lacks the subtlety that is evident in the book and the Musical.

It is a new experience in a musical and I cannot praise it enough.  I will be putting in my pre-order for this film very shortly.  Gerard Butler is the most amazing actor I have ever seen and though I have seen many incarnations of the Phantom in film and on stage, I feel that his performance gives true emotional life to the Phantom and makes him someone we can all relate to.  All the other performances were great and I loved Minnie Driver's Carlotta...she was perfect for the role.  The story is beautiful and even though I've seen the movie close to 20 times, I will always draw in a breath when the chandelier is lifted.  Deny the critics.

Comparing to the show I thought they did a great job! This classic story of a Phantom,"" the masked man"" who roams the Opera in Paris is spellbinding. The Phantom falls in love with Christine, whom he secretly tutors. He becomes extremely jealous when a man comes into her live from the past and they are deeply in love.  This starts the extreme chaos at the Opera. I absolutely love the story. The costumes and the scenery made the movie have more of a magical touch. I thought the movie was done perfectly. I think it is a good movie to add to your Broadway to Screen movies (Chicago). Though the movie is excellent it may not do well at theaters. It doesn't have the biggest draw of different people. This movie is for people who love romance and music in a movie. I think this movie however will do extremely do well when coming to home viewing.

I had the luck of being able to to see the stage production of Phantom just 2 weeks before the movie came out and I have to say that I was disappointed in the stage production here locally and thought the film was just phenominal.  This movie moved me so much more than the stage production did. I actually cried in the theatre.  I left the stage production a bit let down and confused about that whole story?  Maybe it was an off night for the players who knows?  I have been told that unless I saw Phantom with Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford I was not seeing it to it fullest.  To be honest I have heard the recordings of both of them when they were doing Phantom and I have to tell you that although I loved Michael's voice, I disliked Sarah's almost cotton ball in the mouth like sound and I couldn't understand a word she sang.  With that said this is probably why the film appealed to me.  Everything was clear and understandable.  I am a huge fan of musicals but something gets lost when you can't understand what the person is saying.  I thought that the cast was well picked and thought that Emmy was a wonderful Christine and showed a more youthful innocent side to Christine that we have not seen on stage.  Though Gerard Butler is clearly not an Opera singer he gave the Phantom a different voice one that showed his anger, love and heartache very clearly and that was Andrews intention for Phantom all along.  He even said in and interview on ""HBO First Look"" that he always saw Phantom in more of a raspy Rock Voice.  Andrew would never have allowed Gerard Butler to play Phantom if it was not what he wanted.  Patrick Wilson as Raoul was just fantastic.  I felt every bit of his tender love for Christine and his voice just left me in awe.  All players in this film made every bit of it enjoyable and I just can't say enough about all of them.  If you go into this film as many have hoping you will hear copies of Sarah or Michael.... DON'T!  Have an open mind and remember that this is film not stage.  Take it for what it  is....  It is definately a film I will be seeing again on the big screen and will own in my collection of movies."	5.0	Just Beautiful!!!!!  I was Floored!!!!!!!	2005-01-05	6	5	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AVB28X5Q4GV63	movie lover	I am not a fan of Andrew LLoyd Webber.  I find his musicals to be self referential and repetitive.  I never heard or saw any of the three principal leads before.  I didn't see the movie in the theater. I saw Phantom on stage many years ago and was not impressed.  That being said, I rented the film last week and cannot stop watching it!!  I'm obsessed!!Andrew LLoyd Webber's music is not any better.  The libretto needs vast improvement.  What is better and improved is the extremely sexy and soul-stirring Phantom, Girard Butler.  He is too sexy to be the loathsome, horrifying phantom.  Nothing like Lon Chaney or Herbert Lom.  Clearly miscast.  While Emmy Rossum has a spectaular voice and an ethereal beauty, she lacks real emotion in the part.  I could not read what she was thinking or feeling because all her expressions were similar.Nonetheless,I am hooked.  If given the choice whether to go with Raoul or stay with the Phantom, I would stay. Christine should have chosen better.Highly recommended!!	4.0	I'm obsessed	2005-07-04	2	2	0

All of the actors and actresses were wonderful in it, especially Emmy Rossum.  I still can not believe she was 17 when she made this movie. Her voice is absolutely spectacular in this movie as Christine. The music very much took just to Andrew Lloyd Webber's music and it is just incredible! This movie was confusing at parts, but if you just watch it, you will get the whole jist of it. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to all movie goers alike.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1LNGMHFMWAPQG	moviePhan	"I'm glad I saw this film before I read any reviews or saw the play in New York or Toronto. The magic of the ""night"" blew me away and has filled my senses ever since!My heart started racing when the organ was rumbling the intro, and I watched the chandelier rise to the ceiling. The changing panorama of the Opera Populaire from decaying dregs to golden slave girls and opulent red velvet seating was terrific. I felt myself surrender entirely to the ""Phantom"" experience.Emmy  Rossum was outstanding as the teenaged ""Christine"". Wide-eyed, innocent, and with a vocal range that showed training, breadth, and inspiration. Patrick Wilson as ""Raul"" had that strong tenor needed to cement the good-guy role and portrayed just enough self-confidence and self-importance that any Viscompt would provide.(Now, here's where your senses really start to tingle) The haunting ""Brava, brava, bravisima"" filters into the speakers. Scant moments later we catch our first face-to-face glimpse of the soulful Phantom through the dressing room mirror. It's all you can do to stay seated! Gerard Butler then entices Christine (and us) down to his dandy dungeon (and the darkest portions of his longing) on a feverish, muscle-tensing trek that's never resolved--even when the credits roll! His rendition of  ""Music of the Night"" is a heart-stopping, seduction of the audience as well as the heroine which caresses with more than just the impassioned words. In fact, Butler played the role with so much raw sensuality that we couldn't help but believe the madman was the better choice for any woman between the ages of 18 to 100. He makes you feel what he loves, hates, desires...and his mania, too!As for the rest, see it--trust me!PS: One reviewer said that there should have been a sex scene. Believe me, the whole movie IS a sex scene. And after all, isn't it better when you can use your brain, too? As for the people who had seen the play in the Big Apple and Toronto? They stood up and cheered and said ""he (Lloyd-Webber) got it all!"""	5.0	One For The Senses!!!!	2005-03-13	5	5	0

There was only one good song throughout the entire thing. There was a love story, but this girl kissed the Phantom, then got with this guy, then kissed the Phantom again.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3FIH47F20ORAA	Mr. D. J. Woolrich	I initially viewed this film at the cinema and consequently went a further 4 times! and, on the strength of the film went to the West End to see the theatre production which is outstanding also.The extras on the 2 disc DVD purchaed from the excellent Amazon are good and give further insight into the making of this masterpiece. This is one of those rare films that really could not be improved upon. It is pure and utter genius. The casting is absolutely precise. I had never heard of much of the cast (it is so refreshing that like myself, they are young!) but wow, what a collection of talent. Gerry Butler puts his heart and sole into this role as do all the others and the result is really something not to be missed.The entire film is faultless. The music is penetratingly exquisit with a depth and clarity that adds to the ambiance of the plot.The choriographed scenes such as masquerade are breath taking.I found the film extremely imotive. The first time I saw this film I am not ashamed to say that I was weeping at the end! Everyone can relate to at least one of the characters.If any of the cast read this then all I can say is thankyou for such excellence and to the director, Joel Shumacker and Sir Andrew...UTTER RESPECT!!!!	5.0	Utter genius	2005-05-23	11	8	3

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AQ9XUZLZK62ZT	Mrs Bruna	This is the type of musical I'd normally never buy but I made the exception because I think Gerard Butler is worth it.  Even without the mask, with the so-called deformity of one side of his face, he's sexier and better-looking than the Count.  It's hard to believe that Christine didn't choose him.  The rest of the story I found typically overwrought and full of screeching songs and to be honest, I never got why both men were interested in such an insipid heroine.  But let me give Minnie Driver her props: she was pretty good in her role.  I wonder why she isn't a bigger star.	3.0	I watch this for Gerry  (spoilers)	2010-08-28	3	2	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AMX4202M7D7HV	"M. Secaur ""Meredith Secaur"""	"I really wanted to like this movie, I really did. I also expected a much better result with the stageshow's composer/creator as producer. Sadly, this film fell very short of my expectations and is one of the few movies I've seen which I simply can't stand to watch. It came off pitiful at best, and is not one I'd recommend to my friends. As a listener of the original London Cast soundtrack for years, I was familiar with the music and had a rough grasp of the story. I was curious about the film, and thought ""Well, Andrew Lloyd Webber is working with the filmmakers, so it must be good"". Boy, was I wrong.This film adaptation is boring, incongruous, lacking in any emotional depth or honesty, and grating on the ears. It makes any other musical adaptation's jump from stage to screen, even how terrible, seem like nothing. Anyone who was hoping this would be the great immortalization of one of the best, most timeless musicals will be severely disappointed. Even Andrew Lloyd Webber's brilliant music couldn't save this travestuous adaptation simply because it too was severely altered.I know that my review will get passed over by all the others that laud this film's brilliance, so I'll begin by telling you my own first impression: The first time I saw this, I came away feeling unsettled and totally appalled by the ridiculous and insane spectacle I had just witnessed. Five years later, I still feel this way, only now I'm just angry that some better choices weren't made in production. The choice of Joel Shumacher as director was madness, and every decision after that just got worse. Don't get me wrong here; I LOVED the musical and plan to see it again when I get the chance, but the film just doesn't reach to such heights in my book.I would say this movie was passable and I might be able to enjoy it and overlook the differences between film and show if the music itself hadn't been so severly butchered by the awful choices made in the orchestration department, as well as the beating each song took when belted out by the unfortunate cast. The songs aren't electrifying or exciting anymore, and might end up putting you to sleep. When a great musical like ""Phantom of the Opera"" turns out bad, you know you've picked the wrong people to handle it.For one thing, the choice of actors is atrocious. They have absolutely no chemistry at all, and seem almost perpetually bored, sleepwalking, zombie-like, through their parts. None of them have acting abilities up to the caliber required for such roles, and their voices are nowhere near as strong as they should be for any musical. They sound below average of what you'd find in even the worst Off-Broadway show. They can't even sing on key! They also frequently over-act, under-sing, or whisper, a combination that doesn't work well at all on film and certainly something you can't do on in live theatre without getting booed off the stage. There are so many people who have played in ""Phantom"" on Broadway, in London, and on tour for years, and would have done marvelously, but sadly, none of those wonderful actors and actresses made it in.Patrick Wilson as Raoul was bland and forgettable, even worse than in the original book, though I guess the one thing he has going for him is that he actually can sing, something that seems to have eluded the rest of the cast.Emmy Rossum is much too young to play Christine. At age seventeen, she just doesn't have the chops to carry out any of the songs effectively. She's no Sarah Brightman, that's for sure, and isn't believable as an opera ingenue with such a thin voice as she has. Also, not seem too critical, but she's not much of an actress, and I couldn't believe that anyone would think of her as first choice to play the character who basically carries the whole weight of the story on her shoulders.But if those two are bad, what comes next is even worse. Whoever picked Gerard Butler for the title character made the biggest mistake of all. Mr. Butler had no vocal training prior to being cast, and in this film it sounds like he still needs a lot more. He sort of growls his way through the film, and is also (I know, evil word here) WAY TOO YOUNG for the part. The Phantom isn't supposed to be really old, but he's supposed to have lived under the Opera for many years, and had many careers before turning recluse. It's impossible that he was only in his thirties by the time Christine crossed his path. Even in view of this fact, it would be all right if Butler could act the part of the mad but tender Phantom effectively, but he doesn't. He is gruff and unromantic, certainly not anyone you could picture falling in love with, and certainly not the first person you'd think of as the Angel of Music. As if that weren't bad enough, his supposed disfigurement is so seriously diminished that you don't want to pity his unfortunate situation, but rather ask him why a guy like that would go hide in the cellars of the Opera when all he needed was some minor plastic surgery?I know that the filmmakers chose to have younger, more physically appealing cast in order to appeal to a wider range of audience, a choice which seems to have worked (Just look at the 1,000+ positive reviews on Amazon alone!), but I take it as a major insult to Michael Crawford that Andrew Lloyd Webber chose not to at least ask him to reprise the role he made famous on stage. This movie had been in talks since 1990, but was put on hold when Webber divorced Sarah Brightman. Crawford had expressed interest in playing the Phantom the whole time. It isn't his fault that it took fourteen years to finally materialize. Even so, I'd take Mr. Crawford over Mr. Butler any day. He looks much better in the cape, and could beat Butler in a singing contest at any age. Even Sarah Brightman at forty-five would have done a better Christine than Rossum's whispery, bosom-flaunting portrayal. What was up with those distressingly low-cut gowns? Ugh!The look of the film is all right, I suppose, but it could have been better. In comparing the show to the film, the film is warmer in color and less foggy and mysterious, something I really loved and wish would have been included. It could have looked really spectacular on film. The Masquerade scene is reduced to a monochrome mess with misnomer lyrics (""Flash of mauve, flash of puce, fool and king, ghoul and goose..."") What? In black and white? All I can hope is that the costume designer was color-blind. Nearly of the magical elements are taken out (The magic Punjab Lasso, for example, or the Phantom's exit in the final scene), and the world is presented as less of a fantastic place and more a concrete-hard reality. Also, all of the grand, over-the-top theatricality which really made the show stand out has kind of evaporated, which makes this film just as boring and usual as every other one relased in the last ten years.The movie was also too violent and visually disturbing, which made watching all two-and-a-half hours a painful experience. I'm still astonished how it can be frightening in all the wrong ways and still manages to be unexciting. I also didn't like the depressingly modern feel of the film, brought on by the lazy way in which the actors pronounced and performed their lines, despite the Victorian-esque design and setting. It seemed like a painfully lengthy soap-opera with fancy sets.Since seeing this film, I have read Gaston Leroux's book many times and have seen the stage version once. I have to recommend only the latter two if you want to have a good time. Skip this film."	1.0	Film Phantom Lacks the Brilliance Stage Phantom Exudes	2010-08-30	39	20	19

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AP50P603W4BA7	"Ms. H. Sinton ""dragondrums"""	Emmy Rossum stars as Christine Daae, a young dancer with the Opera Populaire in Paris. She has been having her voice trained by the mysterious 'Angel of Music' so when the Diva, Carlotta (brilliantly portrayed by Minnie Driver) storms out, Christine is propelled into the lead role of the opera house's latest production.What Christine doesn't realise is that her angel of music is also the infamous Phantom and that he is obsessed with her. As Christine falls in love with her childhood sweetheart, Raoul de Chagny (Patrick Wilson), the phantom becomes increasingly unbalanced and determined to possess the young singer no matter what.Joel Schumacher's glossy production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's best loved musical stars, for the most part, a relatively unknown cast, but that doesn't detract in any way from the quality of the film. Rossum was only 17 when this was filmed but she brings a remarkable maturity to her role and she has an incredibly good voice. Gerard Butler, who plays the phantom, doesn't have such a strong voice, but, thanks in the main to his sympathetic and sensitive portrayal of the tortured creature, he pulls it off. A real surprise was Jennifer Ellison (better known to British viewers as the young soap star from 'Brookside') who plays Meg, Christine's best friend. In this role, Ellison shows she can not only act but can sing very well too. Minnie Driver, cast as the spoiled, conceited Carlotta, injects humour and exuberance into her role. She is the only cast member who doesn't perform her own songs but you cannot tell this when watching the film.As would be expected from such a production, the cinematography is outstanding, the costumes are sumptuous and the sets are marvellous. This DVD is presented over 2 discs. Disc 1 is the movie while disc 2 has a wealth of extras such as 'Behind the Mask; the story of Phantom of the Opera', various featurettes and several music videos taken from stage versions of the musical. For those willing to search, there are also some hidden extras; I have found 4 so far.

And how do i get you to send me the correct ones? They are presents for Mothers Day (this coming weekend) and so now I will have to disappoint my mum as I presume I'll not hav ethem in time so cannot give her the presents I had planned! Nobody has come back to me at all and I was dissapointed in Amazon to start with for the wrong DVD's being sent but I am even more disappointed now at the lack of customer aftercare.Please come back to me asap to see if we can rectify the issue!Thank You,Joanne Bloomfield	1.0	Phantom of the Opera and 3000 to Gracelands	2009-03-16	6	0	6

Shaner	"I have read many reviews on this movie, and before watching it, I have always been a fan of Michael Crowfold's phantom, and I love the book version a lot. Like many of you, I had my doubts before I watched the movie. But honestly, I just totally enjoy and love the movie version. One thing that may help you, to really enjoy this movie, you need to try to stop comparing it to other versions. I believe the producer/director/actors were trying to make something new here, and they certainly did it for me. As I was watching, I just developed a deep sympathy towards all three lead characters (Phantom, Christine and Roual). Before, I really only cared about Phantom. I think the cast and the script are both amazing. They made this love triangle the most memoriable one in film history in my opion! I especially enjoy the contrast between Gerard Butler (phantom) and Patrick Wilson (Roual): they differ in their body built, in their voice, in their acting style (GB more physical and expressive, PW more subtle)...yet they balance each other perfectly. Their contrast made me see Christine's delima clearly for the first time.Of course, if you simply cannot get over it (that it is not like the ""right"" version in your mind), I'll have to say just the music, set, and costumes alone in this movie will worth your every penny. The whole production team simply just put so much efforts into it that you will love it one way or the other (story lines, acting, music, special effects etc. You will have to watch the special feature on Disc2 to really appreciate the team effort!), and that's why it is a five stars and must-have in my opinion."	5.0	if you stop comparing different versions, you'll love it	2005-06-15	6	5	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AE3UZW4WIETEC	"M.

However, now, having seen this new release by Joel Schumacher, I wonder what all the criticism was all about.  While the story has morphed from the original Lon Chaney version, it has happily evolved into a classic that will be watched for years to come.  Gerard Butler as the Phantom, and Emmy Rossum and Christine, shine in their roles and bring a compassion and vulnerability not seen before in this drama.  The director, Mr. Schumacher, infuses his film with the deeply caring hand and eye of an artist.  This release is destined to find its way into the film collectors' catalog as one of our favorite classics.	4.0	Passion, Sorrow, Artistry and Shirt Ruffles	2005-05-09	4	3	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2HRJIAZ8QPXO1	"M. Tundermann ""Dante"""	"Clearly, seeing the musical first can give one a biased understanding of the movie, but even for movie fans who have not seen The Phantom of the Opera on stage, this musical will not disappoint.  If you taken the combination of cinematic elements--visuals, music, acting, etc--Phantom scores high marks across the board.  Specifically:-Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler perform great acts of redemption from previously perceived bad films (The Day After Tomorrow and Tomb Raider, respectively).  Seeing the cast, I was a little skeptical, but the cast performs beyond expectations.  Rossum in particular peforms the role of Christine with a charm and voice that grabs the viewer.  Very enticing. Butler also does well, but more on him later.-Andrew Lloyd Webber, the original writer for Phantom, was involved in the screenplay, which was a brilliant move on the part of the production team.  His involvement undoubtedly facilitated the transition of the story from stage to screen, as the various elements of the story align almost perfectly with the Broadway rendition.  This cannot be underestimated; had Webber not been involved, the movie could very well have turned a 180 in terms of quality.-the music; all of Webber's songs appear in the movie, with some--specifically ""The Phantom of the Opera""--having minor modifications, i.e. a little electric guitar mixed with the booming orchestra, that enhance the music's quality (though Phantom purists probably wouldn't approve). As mentioned above, the lead roles perform beautifully, but one should be prepared for some disappointment in Butler's vocals.  As the Phantom is supposed to have a powerful and dominant quality to his singing, intended to lure Christine with his voice, one would expect Butler to be the strongest character in the movie.  Sadly, this is not the case.  Though he performs adequately, he is the Phantom and ""adequate"" is not good enough for that role.  One could argue that Butler was the weakest of the characters, though I would add that that should not take away too much from his overall performance (he certainly isn't overtly detrimental to the musical).In sum, an excellent movie that everyone, especially fans of musicals and the opera itself, should pick up.  When you do, just be sure to take the time to appreciate how integrated modern movie elements are with the original stage elements."	5.0	Brilliant adaptation of the musical	2006-09-27	8	6	2

It's AMAZING, it's a touching and emotional love story with fantastic scenery, costumes, songs - the whole deal wrapped up in one movie. I've seen the stage production in Chicago, read Leroux's book the many Phantom movie versions and stage play is based on, and seen the TV miniseries from about 10 years ago over and over (we taped it).  I enjoy all of them because I don't agonize over comparing the 4 versions. Even though I had seen the stage production, which this movie is based from, I didn't waste a moment of my time comparing the two versions. Perhaps because even though I enjoyed the stage version immensely, I'm not a theater ""aficionado"" (i.e., ""snob"") and can therefore sit back in a movie theater, have some popcorn, and not go apoplectic over trying to compare the movie version to the stage production.As a side note, I took along my two teen daughters and teen nephews and they all loved the movie (yes, even the guys).

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AHM6BNYVFEXOZ	mvaljean	"The filmed version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is a good adaptation of the stage show. The visuals are fantastic, and the score sounds the best it ever has, with a 110 piece orchestra. While some may not like Gerard Butler's phantom because of his lack of musical experience, he does deliver well enough. I'm not going to say too much about the film itself, as most have formed their opinions and giving my 2 cents here won't do much for that. All I'll say whether or not you like the stage version already, this film won't change your opionion greatly either way.One minor problem I have with this film is technical. While I understand that pre-recording the voices is necessary, I found it easy at times to spot where the pre-record and the filmed action singing wasn't synched very well. Also, the lack of ambient sound really made the pre-recorded sound stand out at times. Example: with all that water in the phantom's lair, I'd think you'd hear some if it at some point...Besides this one minor point, the film looks great on DVD, and the sound is as lush and full as one would expect.Regarding the special features, the best I can say is: Not Bad. Included is a trailer on the first disk, but no commentary track (MAJOR DVD no-no...). In the second disk you get a 1 hr documentary about the origin of the stage version, and about 45 minutes of behind the scenes footage, both of which are quite good. I would have like to have seen more, but maybe I've been spoiled by the Lord of the Rings Extended Editions. Also inlcuded is a deleted scene: ""No One Would Listen,"" a song sung by the phantom which was the first version of ""Learn to be Lonely"" before it was cut for pacing reasons in the film. Also, one easter egg can be found (I won't spoil it here). Finally, the case states there is also a link to the ""Phantom's Online World."" It suggests that there are some DVD-Exclusive extas online, but as of the date of this review, all I could find was a link to the official website, which anyone can see.  Again, I would have liked to have seen more, such as other deleted scenes (if any exist), or a documentary about adaptation process from the stage version to the screen (what the took out, what they kept, why, etc...), or maybe a feature about the visual effects of the movie (especially the chandelier during the 'Overture'), or even some simple production photos.Despite the lack of tons of extras, the only thing I will really miss is the lack of any commentary track. There are some basic expectations for major studio DVDs today, and a commentary track is one of them.In the end, this speical edition presents the film with enough extras to barely justify the extra money spent. Unfortunatly, many will probably spend the extra money just for the 2.5 minute deleted scene since it's on the 2nd disk."	4.0	Good Film, OK DVD.	2005-05-05	3	2	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1EJ6JPRI8V6HC	"M. Walsh ""marieannw"""	"I first fell in love with ""Phantom of the Opera"" when I received the Broadway soundtrack from a friend. I wore out my tape listening to it so many times. Then I was fortunate enough to see the Broadway version, though not with the original cast, and I loved that as well. I only recently saw this movie version on HBO, and it is by far my favorite! I love the fresh interpretation brought to this version. Emmy Rossum was a perfect Christine, young, naive and vulnerable; Patrick Wilson made a great Raoul; but I was most impressed with Gerard Butler as the Phantom. His performance is mesmerizing, and I loved his voice, not the same as Michael Crawford's but more deep and earthy, a great contrast to Wilson's voice. Interestingly, both my daughter, who sang portions of ""Phantom"" in high school chorus, and I prefer Butler's voice to any other we've heard. The cinematography is stunning, a visual feast. A wonderful movie and highly recommended."	5.0	A wonderful version!	2006-02-15	2	2	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1D0AZ6KY9PLKV	M. Wood	"Well, to begin, I'm going to say I thought this movie was fantastic for the most part. It was visually stunning, the sets were absolutely beautiful. The acting was good, not great, but good.Probably the best thing I have to say about this movie is the actual music. As for the vocals, they were good. But the music in this movie is absolutely beautiful. Haunting beautiful. People complain about it being ""too musical"" but it is a musical. And a much better musical than most. People compare it to Moulin Rouge and Chicago, which honestly just absolutely sickens me. Those movies are nothing in comparison musically to Phantom of the Opera.As for the acting... it wasn't the best, but it wasn't horrible either. Rossum, along with Wilson, had a few shaky parts but did rather well. Now... with all that said, I'd have to say my biggest problem was the Phantom. Not his acting, and not even his singing, I've never seen the broadway version, but I have heard the soundtrack, and while I think Gerard Butler CAN sing, there is no doubt that Michael Crawford outsings him 20 times over. But... even though Butler's voice isn't great, he makes up for it with the passion and force he puts behind it.My other problem with the phantom is that he just looks so good. The Phantom is supposed to be completely disfigured and just revolting. But, throughout the entire movie, even when he's NOT wearing his mask, he's still 20 times more attractive than, say, Raoul, who is supposed to be the most handsome man in the movie, but he still doesn't quite live up to the Phantom in that regard. I mean, what woman WOULDN'T choose the phantom over Raoul in this movie?But even saying those few bad things about Phantom of the Opera, I think it's definetely added to my ""favorite movie"" list. And, I definetely recommend this movie."	4.0	Good movie... but...	2005-05-30	4	1	3

So, a friend and I went and ever since that day, I have not been able to stop thinking about it. This truly was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. Just three days later, I was BEGGING to see it again!No movie has ever had this intense effect on me.  Gerard Butler's performance as the Phantom was simply (well, NOT so simply) MINDBLOWING.  He put his heart and soul into every word, every movement, every glance and totally dissolved his being into this role.  To this day, I still can't see HIM within the Phantom.  Emmy Rossum was the best possible and  most excellent choice for Christine.  Vocally and emotionally, she portrayed her character to the full extent.  Even her facial expressions, which constituted the best depiction of her role, delivered the credibility needed 100%.  Every actor within this movie were truly the best at their roles.  No other substitutions have ever even come up within my mind.The art direction, the cinematography, the costumes, the music, the extraordinary acting...nothing is left out. Altogether, these all made this a masterpiece. Every little piece and detail of this movie made it what it is.  Even if one litle thing were missing, it would take away from the entire film.  I have not been able to stop raving about this since I saw it three months ago, and just the thought of owning it on DVD makes me the happiest person on earth.I have never FULLY loved any movie, every single part of one, before. This is the exception to every, and I mean every, rule.  Those critics that rave on and on about how this movie was abominable?  Yeah, well, they're all outnumbered and ignored by all the fans whose lives and furthermore, SOULS, have been touched by this movie. To sum it up, it really doesn't get any better than this. If I could strongly recommend just one thing, one movie, one piece of brilliance, this would definitely be it, a thousand times over."	5.0	The Most Beautiful And Tragic Film	2005-04-03	13	12	1

But I have heard of the wonderful music of this production, and couldn't wait to watch it on the big screen.  I wasn't disappointed at all, unlike some of the reviewers here - I think it's because I approached this movie with fresh eyes.  Emmy Rossum's voice was clear and beautiful, and apart from a few errors that my chorus teacher would cringe at the movie was spectacular.  I could feel the characters' emotions (even though I didn't like Christine's indecisiveness).  The movie drew me in with its story and its gorgeous sets and costumes.  I felt that Butler played the Phantom very well, dark and sensual.  You should watch this movie and then watch the play; if the play really is better than the movie then it'll probably spoil it for you.

When I first saw the film, I could not control myself from crying.  My heart goes out to the Phantom, and everytime he says ""Christine"", my heart just breaks.  The chemistry between Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler sizzles. My favourite scenes are when Christine and the Phantom singing together ""Past the Point of No Return""...God, one could feel the fire between them....and the scene of Christine singing alone ""Wishing you were somehow here again"" in the cemetery, sent shivers up my spine and gave me goosebumps.  This man (the phantom) all he wanted was to be with Christine, and yes Christine loved him...my heart breaks when she said to him ""beautiful creature of darkness, what kind of life have you known. God gave me courage to show you that you are not alone"" and kisses him.  If this is not love what is?  I highly recommend this film...for I have seen it 10 times, already.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3DDPQ9342UNMY	"N. Doyle ""film buff"""	"After reading some indifferent reviews from several so-called qualified ""critics"", I kept my fingers crossed and hoped for the best because, frankly, I love the Andrew Lloyd Webber score that I had only heard on recordings. Never saw the stage version.I loved it!! And if you appreciate musicals of this caliber (it's operatic in concept), you'll find much to admire.Handsome Gerard Butler has been unfairly attacked for giving a poor vocal performance because he doesn't have the high tenor capabilities of Michael Crawford. Forget about it--he's in fine shape, physically and vocally and delivers a strong, sometimes tender and always masculine performance that is altogether in keeping with this concept of the story. He is strong in conveying the pain of the tortured creature he plays.Others are well cast too. Emmy Rossum has a clear, lyric soprano voice and is clearly up to the task of performing the demanding songs in a pleasing fashion while projecting youthful innocence and luminous beauty.Patrick Wilson is very effective as Raoul. His diction is impeccable, even in song. Unfortunately, the same cannot always be said of the other singers--many times the lack of clear enunciation leaves the lyrics inexplicable, which was true in the stage version too.Aside from minor flaws, the film is gorgeous to look at, brilliantly staged for maximum effect from the very opening shot of the Paris Opera Populaire in 1916 (photographed in black and white) until the final climactic scenes beneath the famed opera house. All of it is filmed in a continually moving and prowling camera movement that makes us feel that the phantom's prowling has become part of our viewing experience.It all has a dark, glittering style that is entirely in keeping with the atmosphere needed to make this kind of story ring true. Richly photographed and sensuous in its appeal, it will keep you absorbed throughout its entire running time. The full orchestra orchestrations of the 110 piece orchestra are an added bonus for the movie version, particularly when rendering the Phantom theme at full throttle.All I can say is, if you like the Webber score, you'll love what they've accomplished here, giving lush cinematic style to the prowling camera-work that seems to cover every corner of the mysterious stage settings.Minnie Driver provides effective comic relief as La Carlotta in her over-the-top performance, as do Ciarin Hinds and Simon Callow as the new opera owners. Settings, costumes and John Mathieson's stunning cinematography cannot be praised highly enough.Don't believe those negative reviews. No doubt this will be regarded as a masterpiece in years to come, when strict adherence to the stage version is no longer important and comparisons to Brightman and Crawford are relegated to the past. Furthermore, from what I've seen of Brightman's performance, her stylized approach to the role never would have worked on film.Visually, it's one of the most sumptuous productions of this story that you are ever likely to see."	5.0	Cinematic version of Broadway musical is visually stunning and highly satisfactory...	2007-06-07	6	5	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AP6E1I77Y1JH9	Newfiepepper	Wow, how could anyone take such an amazing play, such an unforgettable piece and ruin it so? It takes mad skills I tell you!I adore Phantom of the Opera, and I'm not much into love stories, but this is my all time favorite play. I adore the rich music and the strong emotions interwoven throughout the whole thing. The people in this film cannot sing. I can't sing either so I know what bad singing sounds like. I dare you to listen to another version, watch the 25th anniversary performance of it, something, and you'll hear what I mean. The people in the film are ok singers, but ok singing isn't enough for this play. The music is so rich, so strong, so amazing that it needs voices of equal caliber to match and it does not.Secondly the emotions are subtle at best. Maybe it's just a different way to play the same characters, but there are so many strong emotions in this play that when it's not conveyed it loses everything. The performance of the emotions from everyone was lackluster at best. I'm very theatrical, I enjoy things that are as strong and dramatic as possible. That's just me though, if you want a more subdued version of Phantom of the Opera then this might be the one for you, just don't expect the singing to be breathtaking as it should be.Finally, I thought I had never seen this version before. Watching it I recall bits and pieces of almost every scene, telling me that I have seen it before. I'm sure I didn't see it more than five years ago, and yet I didn't even remember that I had seen it? This tells me that the movie is forgettable. I remember good movies, this is not a good movie.I advise you borrow or rent this movie before you buy it. If you love it, no harm done in testing it out first. If you hate it then you've saved yourself the heartache of spending money on this thing. I don't think this version is what it should be, I think a movie version of this play could have really been amazing and this was not due to poor acting and even worse singing.	1.0	Forgetable	2012-08-21	9	3	6

Emmy and Gerard portrayed their characters perfectly and brought the musical to life. Emmy just looked the part; very innocent and sweet. Gerard was very very emotional throughout the film, and it did not seem like he was just rehearsing his lines (which is the lighter side to having an actor play the role). You know, they sound a lot better in the film than they do on the CD. Trust me, it flows better when you get to see the acting that goes along with the singing (Gerard's occasional yelling makes better sense---he's emotional, guys :) Patrick was too. He definately convinced me that he cared deeply for Christine. In fact, he got a little jealously teary-eyed himself watching her and Erik caress eachother. The girl who played Meg was so cute! And Giry was just how I imagined her. She took on the absent Persian's role quite well (she always sort of hints that she knows a little more about the ""ghost"" than everybody else.)

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2WMPYQA0VDO3H	Nickibockers	"This glorious adaptation of the wonderful musical is from the first moment strikingly gorgeous. The costumes are beautiful, and the sets stunning, the actors top notch.But the problem is the Phantom. While undeniably sexy and just drop dead gorgeous, despite his deformation, it is easy to see how Christine has been captivated by this dark creature. But it is not his looks alone that have seduced her, it is his voice. I give Gerard Butler an ""A"" for effort (and A++ for fitting the physique of the role perfectly) but he lacks the vocal qualities that make him as the Phantom a truly convincing fit and for that I give him a C+, because he's really not that bad, he's just not as good as he needs to be. He struggles with the higher, softer notes that were so velvetly delivered by Michael Crawford and San Francisco cast's Franc D'Ambrosio - a hard act to follow by anyone - as well as the powerful emotional phrases, most notably in the ""Down Once More"" sequence, painfully squawking at points. For having no formal musical training, his performance is admirable.I was pleased with the extension of Raoul's character, who is usually so flat and undeveloped, it is hard to see why Christine chooses him. Even still, I noticed a lack of chemistry between the two characters and actors. While it is evident that they cared deeply for each other, I wasn't convinced of any true romantic feelings between them. I felt that Raoul could have been more emotional in his singing. Also, Christine's wide-eyed innocence is rather flat. I know her character isn't supposed to carry the flare of, say Minnie Driver's absolutely hilarious, wonderfully over-the-top La Carlotta (a true feat of casting, here), but Emmy Rossum's Christine seems to have fallen a little flat, waffling only between wide-eyed hypnosis and surprise. A real gem was Miranda Richardson's Madame Giry, giving a wonderful performance as the protective (of both her daughter and the phantom) and somewhat mysterious lady.A change that everyone noticed and an inconsistency for those who have never seen the musical in the theatre, is the glorious graveyard scene when Christine visits her father's grave. Mr Daae was supposed to be poor, Christine only able to be a chorus girl and instead we see a magnificent mausoleum for the Daae household. Had she been this rich, she might have been able to be a more prominent figure in the opera productions. My only explanation is that the Phantom might have secretly erected this monument for her, as he still in this production seems to be older than her, even if only by what looks like 5 years.Nevertheless, the setting of this movie is exquisite, the addition of a sword-fight between Raoul and the Phantom was clever and well-fit, and I loved being submerged into the darkness of this film, and only wish that Schumacher for all his inspiration (including his borrowing a scene from Jean Cocteau's La belle et la bete) had found a stronger Phantom, and encouraged more abandon in the acting, especially Christine and Raoul's characters. Then the film would have been perfection. As it is, it is still marvellous."	4.0	Visually Stunning, but...	2005-01-11	2	2	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3VIETK0S9M2BM	"Nicolas D. Rodriguez ""student"""	"I saw ""the Phantom of the Opera"" on stage in London when I was 12 and fell in love with the music and story right away. Since then I have read Gaston Leroux's novel which the musical is based off of and seen the show twice on Broadway. Once I heard about the theatrical release of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera I was excited and could not wait to see the movie.Before entering the movie I wondered how Joel Schumacher would decide to portray the famous tale on the big screen. I was pleasantly surprised to see how wonderful a job Schumacher did combining aspects of the show and novel to create, what I think, was an amazing movie. From the first black and white scene of Paris in 1917, through the ending credits, you could see how much detail was put into every aspect of the movie's creation.The sets were extravagant and beautiful, throughout the movie I felt like I was actually inside the opera house, witnessing the events of the story. The costumes also fit the time period, 1870, perfectly. Everything on the screen looked and felt like it belonged there. From Lady Carlotta's over-the-top costumes to match her personality, to the dark yet elegant clothes the Phantom wears, I feel like the costuming and set design enhanced the story far beyond what I have seen in other recent movies.There was also an amazing job done with the casting of the film. Emmy Rossum, only 16 years old at the start of filming, does an amazing job playing Christine. Rossum has a beautiful voice, and her portrayal of emotions helps understand what she is going through with her twisted love of the Phantom. Patrick Wilson also gives a strong performance as Raoul. I felt that Wilson had the best voice in the film, and also did a tremendous job acting the part of a daring hero. Minnie Driver also did a noticeably splendid job playing the part of Carlotta, a stereotypical diva, and provided a few laughs throughout an otherwise dark story. My two favorite performances however came from Simon Callow, Andre, and Murray Melvin, the conductor of the opera's orchestra. After working in the scrap metal industry, Andre and his partner Firmin learn to run an opera house. I feel however Callow fit the part of an old French theater owner to a ""t."" Melvin, while having only a small part, did more than I thought could be done with the role. You can see the pain on his face as Carlotta acts up and throws temper tantrums, to his calm and peaceful state as the orchestra is following his lead. The only role I think that could have been noticably improved was Gerard Butler's performance of the Phantom. While Butler's acting was probably the best throughout the movie, showing the pain and torment of a tourchered individual, I felt that Butler's vocal performance was sub par, especially when compared to all the solid preformance's given by the rest of the cast.I also fell Schumacher did a great job with filming. As opposed to focusing on the actor or actress singing on stage, he utilizes the ability of film to portray the background and backstage happenings of the opera house. There were many scenes where shots of drunks backstage, or bored actors helped furthrt build the aurora of realism that was successfully achieved throughout the movie.Overall, while not the greatest movie I have ever seen, I enjoyed watching the Phantom of the Opera more than most movies in recent history. The friends who I saw this movie where really diverse. There were people who didn't know the story, people who hated musicals, and people who were in love with the Phantom, like me. While not everyone loved the movie as much as I did, we all walked out smiling because we enjoyed the 2 hours and 15 minutes we spent in the theater. I would truly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals, likes the story, and/or appreciates a good all around film."	5.0	A hauntingly beautiful work	2005-04-13	8	4	4

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3LCD5FWBDYGAP	"Nightcat ""Nightcat"""	Yes, this movie deserves as much praise as the stage version.  No, nothing has been lost in the translation from stage to screen.  If anything, the storyline grows up, finding its own past.  The viewer will find out a lot more about the Phantom's past and find out why he is a fixture at the opera.As for the Phantom, Butler does a excellent job.  He handles a role with as much wieght as say, Richard III, and does so flawlessly.  The Phantom here is an almost wild creature, but in the sense that his past abuse made him a fighter.  The viewer can only pity a man driver underground by a heartless world.Emmy is wonderful too, you almost can't believe you are hearing such a clear and soaring voice.  Her years at the Met served her well, and to listen to her is a sheer delight. Note: You can hear a pin drop when Miss Rossum is ending 'Think of Me'.Driver is a delightful Carlotta, the first woman to make me admire and love the prima donna.  The rest of the cast is wonderful too, and between the cast, music, and the photography the film earned three each of Goldden Globe and Oscar nods.  Lastly, if you love cinematography done well, rich orchestration, and a good romance story you must see this film.	5.0	Phantastic!	2005-01-30	4	3	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AE9GFLD4RAMGN	"Nike ""Gaurdian of the flame"""	"Two words jump to mind when I consider this film; ""Rock and Roll!"" Not because it's got anything to do with what is commonly know as ""rock and roll"" but because it has an energy, a vitality, that pulses and rocks deep into your soul just like great rock and roll does. Yet it is the most lush, gorgeous and most surprising film I've ever seen. This is saying something because I am a picky movie maven who loves movies.This screen version of Andrew Lloyd Weber's stage production is in a class by itself and deserves to be treated as such. The artistic direction, execution and design are breathtaking, inviting the audience into the sumptuous world of 19th century Parisian opera house intimacies. As such, it delivers to us the classic, heart-rending tale of the the mistreated, deformed outsider, the Phantom of the Opera, and his doomed love of the innocent, young singer, Christine Daae, played to perfection by newcomer, Emmy Rossum.The opening sequence alone is worth the price of admission, easing us from an old dagurotype to live action, blowing you out of your seat as the chandelier explodes into the wild, spectacular sensuality of the once teaming opera house in all it's wondrous glory of thirty years earlier. It's pure artistic genius, which is true of the entire film.The Phantom, played by jaw-droppingly sexy, Scottish actor Gerard Butler, is nothing short of remarkable and is not to be missed. If you've seen him in any of his earlier work, mostly adventure fluff pieces, he will knock your undies off with his nothing short of miraculous transformation into the Phantom. Butler brings an intensity, a raw masculine sensuality and power, with a depth of  passion rarely seen in any film. Clearly, he was born to play this part. His performance never fails to move move me even when I know what's coming, which is something truly remarkable.This superlative work of art is a film experience not to be missed. Like myself and all of my many friends who have seen it don't be surprised if it's haunting themes and glorious music ""sings songs in your head"" for days afterward, very likely until you succumb to it's ""phantastic"" inspiration and go out and buy the fabulous soundtrack. Enjoy!"	5.0	Astonishing	2005-02-09	6	5	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2V7H696VF3EFS	nikhil sud	The play created history. The music created history; and I think the film does justice!What does one expext from this film, if one has not seen the play (which I have not)? Sheer lavishness, grandeur, a heartfelt narratative of romance and awesome music. You'll have experienced all this and more once you have seen the film!Right from the beginning of the film, one can sense the artistic sensibilities that have gone into making this film.The film begins with a beautifully picturised scene of an auction in Paris. The image is black-and-white, aprears broken, and the sound seems fragmented. At the auction. when the chandelier (connected with the never-completely-solved mystery of the Phantom Of The Opera) is revealed- the scene transforms into lavish colour, loud brilliant music; then story of the past begins- the story of the Choir girl Christine, her love Raoul and the Phantom of the Opera himself.It is interesting to see that here, unlike in most films, the present is shown in black-and-white scenes (which give you the feeling of old undeveloped images), and the past is shown in lavish colour.The only negative aspect of the film is that at times, actually at very few times, you'll find yourself yawning. The film does get slow at a few places- but those places are too few and far-between to hamper the overall impact of this magnificent film.Even though it is a musical, and most of the narrative is through song, one never wishes it wasn't that way. The songs and how they are sung keep you engrossed.This mesmerising, excellently-made film is truly a must-see.	5.0	A treat in every way!	2005-06-14	2	1	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2VST6VQUPM6PO	N. May	"I can only speak of this motion picture in glowing terms.  It wasn't just any movie, it was an experience.  After watching the DVD, I appreciated this film even more.I applaud the Director's vision in casing younger actors.  This version of the story is prettied up and more youthful and appealing than what has gone before.  This artistic endeavor stands alone in its unique approach, great singing talent, and cast chemistry that complies with the tone and mood of the story.  Hopefully, many newcomers will be attracted to this haunting tale and beautiful music.Gerard Butler gives a wonderfully insightful portrayal of the phantom, exuding a profound depth of emotion and sensuality that captures your attention.  It was worth seeing the movie for his performance alone.  His rendition of ""Point Of No Return"" was dynamic.As a long-time POTO fan, I continue to have appreciation for the stage version that Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman are famous for; their talent remains unrivaled.The reviews here seem to indicate that one is either strongly affected or disaffected by this film.  To have so many more favorably rate this movie suggests its powerful impact.The 2-disc DVD has a new song sung by Butler.  Of special note is the dedicated piece to the history of the musical inception and stage versions with clips of Crawford and Brightman that will interest POTO fans.If you bought the DVD and didn't like the movie, consider gifting it to someone who will love it."	5.0	Exceptional Movie	2005-06-08	5	3	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A33TBHM3O9AY17	No one of consequence	"Having twice seen stage productions of ""Phantom of the Opera"" and been impressed both times, I was skeptical when a friend suggested watching this in movie form.  I strongly questioned whether a musical that was intended for the stage could ever be done justice on film.  The answer was a resounding ""Yes!""The quality of the music and vocals was superb, which is not surprising since this score is one of the all-time greats.  The movie script was true to the original stage play, and the actors did an excellent job of bringing depth to their characters, especially the Phantom.  The color and pageantry of the costumes was a wonderful treat for the eyes.  The settings and props were of first-rate quality, and were immediately recognizable and familiar from those I had seen on the stage.  Even better, there were scenes that were either added or modified somewhat, such as Raoul galloping off through the snow on his horse to rescue Christine at the cemetery, or the special effects surrounding the crash of the chandolier, to add a bit of flair that was not reproducible on stage.In short, the quality of this production does not suffer one iota for being done in a video format.  The only thing that lessens it at all is that it must necessarily be compared to the unparalleled excellence of the live experience, but this runs a close second.  Bravo indeed!"	5.0	Exceptionally well done!  Rivals the stage production.	2006-05-12	4	3	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2X01DHEF5K4I1	Norman E. Hill	"Phantom of the Opera--I enjoyed this movie, considerably more than the Broadway and theater versions. Somehow, from the movie, I understood in a deeper sense the plot of the play.I could emphasize with the Phantom, the poor disfigured creature and his hopeless love for the young Christine Daae. I could say, ""Poor Phantom"", while still not wanting him to get the girl.Emmy Rossum, actually about 18 years old herself, played the 16 year old Christine beautifully, both in terms of acting and operatic voice.The climax of the film was touching indeed. Her terminally ill husband lays flowers on her grave. He is struck by the flowers and ring, obviously deposited by the Phantom, still alive and still grieving himself for his lost love, Christine.Although Phantom has been acclaimed for its music, I found the score so-so. It was the depth of the plot that got me. In another film, Billy Crystal expressed his disdain for the Phantom's live theater musical version, paraphrasing as follows:  ""This guy has a mask, covering his pizza for a face. The main melody of the play is a copycat version of `School Days, School Days.'"" Maybe it was plagiarized, but in the film version, I didn't mind one bit."	5.0	Phantom Movie--Better than Broadway	2009-12-15	0	0	0

However as I was waiting for the releasing of DVD especially the 2-Disc Special Edition.  I was so disappointed to the way that they put the special feature.  I meant that I would love to see lot...lot...lot of things in the film such as an interview of Gerard Butler, Joel Schumacher, Patrick Wilson, etc. But after watching the special feature parts ""Behind the Mark"" I did understand for one thing that ALW would like to honor the original casts and crews of ""The Phantom of The Opera"" (Stage Performance).  That part took almost 70 mins with the interviewing, the old footages of something that you might called it as the historical of the stage shows in bits and pieces.  I'm not said that I hate it but...it bored me to death.  I would appreciated if they put the bits and pieces of behind the scene, the rehearsal, the singing class or voice practices of the cast especially Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson.  The only part that I really like is the deleted scene ""No One Would Listen"" and the cast & crew sing-along (that's very funny).  The rest I would not said it bad, it's sort of educational rather than entertainment.  I am not the musician and no idea about the composing the music.  I'm just an ordinary film lover who enjoy good film, good acting and sweet music, that's all.  I can only say that I love the deleted scene, second to the film, Well! I think that comforted me a little bit for the times I have been waiting for this special edition to be released."	5.0	Excellent Flim But.....!!!!!	2005-04-26	9	5	4

He was so wonderful that I have fallen in love with him and his character.  You couldn't have picked a more wonderful role for such a gorgeous hunk like Gerard.  I hope to see him in many more movies.  I have seen this show 5 times and I never tire of it.  I go into a state of hypnosis while watching it and I can fully feel the Phantoms pain.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3BYWFD8TXTT1E	Older But Wiser	"In actuality, away from Andrew Lloyd Weber's beautiful score, the story is pretty ludicrous.Christine is 16 years old in the movie, way too young to be dallying with two much older men, way too young to be playing them against each other sexually. The Phantom has serious anger management issues and ALL women should steer clear of this dude at all costs! In a month  if Christine had married the Phantom, she'd be fleeing to the nearest Abused Women's Shelter.But this was a beautiful movie to watch. I agree, it was very miscast. I saw the original play in L.A. in '92 and it pretty much put me to sleep. I thought I was sick of the music score and not impressed with the story, but I was very wrong.This movie refreshed the music score by making the story clearer to me. I don't normally care for Minnie Driver, but she nearly stole the whole movie as the Prima Donna/Diva (bad) Opera singer. Ciaran Hinds, who played Caeser in HBO's Rome, shows his versatility at comedy as one of the put-upon new Opera House owners. The costumes and sets were magnificent. Yes, Gerard Butler was mis-cast. He's a gorgeous man who is not getting the roles he should be getting.He was in the bomb ""Time Line"", what a waste.  Wish he'd gotten the title role in Alexander! Or Troy! Or somewhere else where they need a real, grown up man, not a teeny-bopper, surfer type.Even if you are tired of the score and the play, this movie completely refreshes the whole thing. Rent it!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2BKN2KLCBSV98	"Opera Ghost ""OG"""	"The Phantom of the Opera DVD is quite simply put, bad. How bad you ask? Ummm, nails on a chalk board and nasty papercut bad. I will elaborate...from the beginning.Though I was looking forward to this film, I was doing so very cautiously. I have yet to see an ALW musical that translated well on screen...and I was hoping that this time, things would be different. After all, the dashingly handsome and talented Patrick Wilson was cast as our hero, Raoul Vicomte de Chagny. Ok, so I admit, for me, that was the only thing the film had going for it.  Sir Andrew (Lloyd Webber) was producing and had full creative control over his project, but still...something told me to remain cautious.Clue #1: Joel SchumacherClue #2: And I cringe as I type this out, only because he is terribly hot and seemingly the nicest guy, but...Gerry Butler. Let me just mention that when he was cast, I had never heard of him before. Wasn't sure if an ""unknown"" without any real professional vocal training/experience could pull off a role that was vocally heavy.Clue #3: This was a film that nobody ever thought would be produced. Casting rumors had been swirling for YEARS teasing people with the idea that the film was coming to fruition.Cut to...November something or another. I went with a friend to see an advanced screening where the entire cast, director and Sir Andrew would perform a Q&A; following the screening. As the lights dimmed and the music began to swell, I sat anxiously in my seat only hoping that the film would on some level make me as happy as the stage version had for so many years. Despite my initial suspicions, I did have to admit that the trailer looked AMAZING. It was dramatic, stunning, colorful, exciting...all good things...or so I thought because the trailer ended up being the only good thing about the film.The opening sequence was great, I got chills from being so excited. Then, I got chills throughout the rest of the film because it was so horrid. How do I describe the film...cheesy, disjointed, ugly, badly directed, bad pacing, bad cinematography...did I mention cheesy? The actors in the Andre and Fermin roles were trying too hard resulting in unbelievable characters that you didn't mind not liking. Then came the Masquerade scene...it was dull, boring and very GOLD. Yes, GOLD and they were VOGUE-ING (a la Madonna). I won't even bother elaborating.As for the main characters...Emmy Rossum exceeded my expectations and I thought was well cast as Christine. I knew of her, but wasn't very familiar with her body of work.  Patrick was a fine Raoul, however I didn't think it showcased the breadth or depth of his talent. It was a great experience for him I'm sure, and he did a fine job in the role. Patrick 's  voice far outshined the rest of the cast (and I'm not just saying that because he is a two-time Tony Award nominee in musical theatre). My only real criticism for him is indirect as it is due to whoever thought that Raoul should have long hair. It might have worked on some actors in the role, but not Patrick. Shorter hair to match the period of the film, yes...but long hair? It just made him look gay and like a wimpy Raoul. Sorry Patrick.Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the Phantom supposed to have some horrific disfigured face? Well, ...Gerry was hardly disfiugred and barely horrifically freakish. He had a droopy, lazy right eye and perfect skin on his left side. Oh yeah, and a bad wig. How then is he scary when he's too pretty? Maybe it was his singing that was most frightening to Emmy's Christine? Not sure, but if any of the creative PTB were going for scary and disfigured Gerry/Phantom I've gotta say, ""Sorry folks, you failed because he was much to pretty.""I almost forgot to mention Minnie Driver's performance...again, weary when I heard she was cast as Carlotta, a Bel Canto (as she would say) operatic singer, but she was really great. She didn't exactly do her own singing (except for the end-credits) but she pulled off the over-the-top diva-esque Carlotta perfectly.Ok, so after all that (and trust me, this is all an abbreviated ""review"" of sorts), cut to today, May 3, 2005. It is a big day in the world of CD and DVD releases for me. To start, today was the day Spamalot -- the hottest ticket on Broadway -- was being released as was Little Women -- the best show I saw on my last trip to New York. In addition, I was waiting for the DVD of POTO because of all the special features. Though I wasn't sure what would be on it, I figured it had to be somewhat informative. Big mistake -- is anyone seeing a trend with me in regard to this film? Hey, you figure, 2-disc DVD, that second disc has gotta be something! WRONG. Said second disc has 3 features. To the average viewer, they can ooh and ahh at the ""Behind the Mask""/""Behind the Scenes"" BS...but I've already heard this story before! Give me something else, right? WRONG. Give me ""interesting"" interviews or unique behind the scenes...give me (at the very least) a freaking commentary track from Sir Andrew and any member (or 2, or 3, or 4) of the cast. Again, my bad as I assumed.Said DVD left me with a bad taste in my mouth as did my opinon of the film (which ironically is playing in the background as I type. One can call it ""inspiration""). I admit, my expectations might have been too high...I was a faithful Phantom Phan for years, particularly during it's long run here in LA, but with Sir Andrew  involved, legit theatre people cast in key roles, you'd think it would be decent...sadly, not so much."	1.0	A note...	2005-05-04	25	12	13
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A37ZCSAT3YMBEO	OperaSinger	"I really don't know where to begin with this review... Gerard Butler was an excellent Phantom. I know he wasn't the best singer, or the fact that his deformity merely looked like a sunburn gone wrong, but you all have to remember Gerry is not a trained singer; he's an actor. His acting was great! He was my first Phantom and I fell in love with him the minute he sang ""The Music of the Night"". Yes he's no Ramin Karimloo (My favourite Phantom), he's not a Michael Crawford, or a John Owen-Jones (My other fave Phantom) but Gerry posses his own unique style. Andrew Lloyd Webber said he wanted a Phantom with a more Rockish style to his voice, and Gerry fit the part well. Sure they sexified this deformed maniac, but I do believe it was also to appeal to us younger girls who love the dangerous, mysterious, yet sexy man. Emmy Rossum was a good Chrisine, she had that youthful voice and I  think her acting was good too, not great, but good. Patrick Wilson was great as Raoul, he seemed to understand the character. His voice was lovely to listen too, it was soft, soothing, just like Raoul's voice should be. The only thing that bugged me about Raoul was that stupid wig! I think Raoul should have shorter hair, but that's merely my opinion. The music itself was astounding like it should be. The only con was that they didn't have ""Notes II"" or ""A Rehearsal For Don Juan"" in the movie. I think in ""Notes II"" they show that Christine does have a spine on her back. The way she sticks up for herself, shows that even she does have a breaking point. (Hints: Christine gets angry with Carlotta, and overwhelmed in ""Notes II""). In ""A Rehearsal  For Don Juan""....well why even skip this song? It has humor in it. I don't know about you, but I get a giggle and a good laugh when I hear Piangi trying to sing ""tangle""... Overall the sets and costumes were amazing, though I do question Christine's ""Nightgown"". I prefer the one on the show better. Anyways, having two copies of the single disk version, I thought that the third time was the charm and I needed an upgrade. I got the two disc edition because I wanted to see the behind the scenes and other footage from the movie. (Also to complete my Phantom movie collection with: Love Never Dies, Phantom 25th Anniversary, Phantom (Charles Dance 1990 version). I would suggest maybe renting before buying if your skeptical still. But if you're a die-hard Phantom ""Phan"" like me.....buy it and ""Listen to the Music of the Night"".

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1ZNGD2TMQY7HQ	Pato Cree	"I'm a huge Phan of the show. It's my all time favorite musical because it was the first show I had ever seen on Broadway and also because it was just amazing IMO. When I heard there was a movie coming out based on the play, I was really excited. However, when I was watching it, I thought, ""What have they done?!"" The first thing to point out is that every one is a terrible singer. Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson are too weak and they're the romantic leads. Gerard Butler (he was great in 300 but...) has no business playing the Phantom. I understand that he was trying to add a new rock-style to the role and I appreciate that but for the Phantom it just doesn't work. He basically screams the notes instead of singing them and when he doesn't scream he just swallows the notes so it sounds artificial and not beautiful. Second, the lip-syncing was beyond saving. During ""Think of Me"" Christine sings kinda pretty but her lips are barely moving and just stands there like a lifeless mannequin. Gerard Butler just over enunciates everything so it looks pretty ridiculous. Third, the direction by Joel Schumacher (the guy behind the atrocious Batman & Robin) is lazy. He's so concerned with the fabulous art direction and cinematography that he forgets about the story and characters. The whole movie is just so dull that the sense of excitement and romance in the play are lost in the transition to the silver screen. Overall, I can't recommend this as decent entertainment although I know I stand against the masses. Skip this one. Watch the musical instead."	1.0	What???	2009-06-09	55	36	19

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A384JAFR8I5KO0	Patricia Ferrara	"After 18 years, The Phantom of the Opera finally hit the screen without either Michael Crawford or Sarah Brightman, who originally played the roles of the Phantom and Christine Daae in London and on Broadway.  The new casting of Gerald Butler in the role of the Phantom is visually pleasant - he's young and handsome, except for that nasty bit under the mask - and Butler can carry a tune, but he clearly wasn't chosen on the basis of his vocal powers.  The film gives the Phantom a past - a childhood of abuse, a rescue by the young Madame Giry - that seems sappy and unnecessary, and takes away from the revelation of his despair at the end of the film.  The two-disc edition contains one new song, ""No One Would Listen,"" in which the Phantom gets to share his pain to the audience.  The song was wisely cut from the theatrical release.  It's too bad the scenes of the Phantom's childhood stayed.  Rethinking the Phantom as a young man is a good idea, despite it making hash of some of the lyrics, but Butler fails to carry off the role.  His voice is just not good enough.  And Butler is physically graceless at times.  He is wooden in climbing up the staircase in ""Point of No Return"" - Emmy Rossum, on the other hand, just seethes with lust on her way up, chest heaving and nostrils flaring - and Butler descends the stairs clumsily when he interrupts the New Year's Eve masquerade party.  It is hard to believe in his powers as a magician, given his awkwardness.Emmy Rossum is very good as the new Christine.  She is as sweet and pretty and innocent and wide-eyed and wounded as the role calls for, and she manages to be all these things without making the audience giggle.  Her voice is fine, but it lacks the brilliance of Brightman's.  It is probably too much to ask that the ingenue be everything;  Rossum comes pretty close.The secondary roles are extraodinarily well-played.  Patrick Wilson is a dashing Vicomte, and his voice is right on the mark.  Minnie Driver plays a very young Carlotta, and she manages to make the spoiled diva child-like and charming, which she never was in the stage version.  Miranda Richardson reimagines the role of Madame Giry, the ballet mistress, into a warmer, much more fully rounded character. The theater managers Andre and Firmin are well cast.  Their performances are witty, and the actors make their main song ""Notes. . ./Prima Donna"" a lot of fun.The production is gorgeous.  It was going to be tough to top the imaginative production design of Maria Bjornson for the theater, and the film wisely goes in a different direction.  The chandelier does not disappoint.  The Opera Populaire comes to life with a huge cast and spare-no-expense sets.  Director Schumacher is inventive in creating detailed business for the actors while the overture plays, and during the musical numbers.  While ""Notes"" starts out lamely - why is the manager singing to the cleaning staff? - it ends hilariously with both managers grovelling in every possible way in ""Prima Donna.""  And the graveyard for ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" is eerie in shades of grey and white, dotted about with wonderfully excessive angels and hooded figures, a dream landscape.  The Phantom's lair is still complete with boat, lake and candleabra that rise from the water, all of which are Gothically tasty.  But the journey to the Phantom's lair comes off as clumsy.  The scene in which the Phantom appears in the mirror and snatches Christine away is thrilling onstage, and anti-climactic as filmed.  At times the pair to be out for a very slow, pointless stroll in the corridors under the theater.  And why does Christine need to ride a horse for a hundred feet or so?  Since this is part of the key sequence of the film, the failure here makes a big thud.  It is partly rescued by the boat trip at the end of the journey, and a sensuous ""Music of the Night"" coming immediately afterwards.  One note:  I wish the director trusted the audience more.  Carlotta is unbelievably bad when she starts singing ""Think of Me.""  No real diva would lose breath control like that.  And just so we don't miss how awful her performance is, two cleaning ladies stuff their ears with cotton when she starts her solo.  We get the point.  Put down the hammer.The screen is so full of detail at times that the widescreen version may be hard to see on smaller television screens, like mine.  The full screen version (sold separately)has the usual problems, but if you have a 27"" screen or smaller, you might want to go with it.The costumes are a disappointment.  The main characters wear some version of the theatrical costumes most of the time, and they work well enough.  (It's hard to be creative in dressing an ingenue in a black cape and hood, after all.  But Adrian managed to make a much more exciting one for Greta Garbo in Mata Hari.)  The costume failure really shows up during ""Masquerade,"" in which the wonderfully colorful and inventive stage costumes have been tamed down to black, white, gold, and silver, and the bizarre beasties have yielded to plain domino masks.  The dance number fails have to the impact of the theater version, too.The extra material on the second disc is worthwhile.  There is a longish documentary on making the stage version of Phantom;  but as neither Sarah Brightman nor Michael Crawford are interviewed, it seems incomplete.  There are some wonderful snippets of the play in various stages of completion, along with promotional videos and other goodies.  I wish there had been more and longer bits.I would really like to see a filmed version of the orginal London or Broadway play released on CD.  It appears that one exists.  Until then, for Phantom fans, this will satisfy your cravings."	3.0	Finally an Onscreen Phantom	2006-07-24	3	2	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3L1MKVCTR5SBO	"Patricia H. Parker ""Bookwoman"""	"I am so glad that someone finally tackled putting this story on film with Lloyd Webber's beautiful music.  As with others who have written reviews, this is one of my favorite shows, and I am a nonrepentent Lloyd Webber fan.The film changes the story around a bit from the stage production, and I think it may have taken some of the mystery away from the ""Angel of Music"" and the Phantom himself.  The stage productions I have seen present the lagoon scene much later in the story, and it keeps the Phantom as a shadowy figure whom even Christine doesn't really know and has never really seen.  I also think the Phantom is much more accessible in this film than in the stage version.  In the film, he is sighted many times by people right on the stage rather than being the subject of a ""ghost story"" until his love for Christine makes him come forward as in the stage versions.  One wonders if the film Phantom wouldn't have been sharing lunch with the crew considering how accessible he is.  Also, one of the other reviews shown here states that the Phantom is made too sympathetic.  This is true, but I think he loses that sympathy when he speaks from Christine's father's crypt making her think that it is her father recommending that she go with him rather than with Raoul.The film cast is very good.  Messrs Butler and Wilson, and Ms. Rossum are all excellent actors and show it.  I'm glad Ms. Rossum has finally been discovered.  I saw her first in ""Songbird"", and I think she is finally blossoming into a beautiful and talented young woman with a lovely voice.  Simon Callow gaves his usual wonderful performance and the ""over the top"" performance of Minnie Driver as the Prima Donna is wonderful.  She deserves the supporting actress nominations she won from several organizations.All in all, this is a film which should be owned and watched over and over just as I listen to my cast recording.  Gerard Butler does not sing as well as Michael Crawford or other actors who played the Phantom in other productions I have seen on stage.  His voice was stretched several times.  However, both Mr Crawford and Ms. Brightman, as talented as they are, are getting a little beyond the age where they could play these parts on screen.  The only regret I have is that with all the production scope of films, one misses sitting in the audience after the lagoon scene on stage wondering ""how did they do that""."	5.0	This is a beautiful film	2005-05-09	3	2	1

I really think that Emmy Rossum as Christine did amazing in this movie. Her singing and acting was excellent. I am a big fan of hers now.Gerry Butler as the Phantom. Well what more do I need to say. I think the one thing about the Phantom was that his face wasn't what I expected. I thought it would be worse. Other than that though, I think that Gerry was excellent as well.Ahh, the young lover Raoul. I think that Patrick Wilson was very good in this movie. He played Raoul very well. It could be played a few different ways, but I think that this is one of the better interpetations of it.The sets in this movie are beyond description. I am very impressed with them.

I don't need to repeat their comments, but I largely agree with the two Spotlight Reviews.What I would like to emphasize in my review is my own experience.  In short, despite any shortcomings in casting, the movie achieves its result which is to move the human heart.This is a beautiful adaptation in terms of music, visual appeal, drama, etc.  There are some casting shortcomings as described in the spotlight reviews, but this is an extremely powerful interpretation.The HD quality visual adds to the whole experience as does the high quality sound.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2UAGTE1T4KJIX	Paula	I have seen Phantom in theaters but none of them measure up to the romance, passion and sexuality of the movie. And because of the younger cast, it's more appealing to the younger generation that perhaps cannot afford to see it at a theater.For the first time, the Phantom comes across as Mr. GQ on one side and the Phantom on the other. His stature and masculinity make you desire him, despite his disfigured face. Unike past Phantoms, Gerard Butler has a strength in his voice that women find desirable. The way his chest rises and falls when he's close to Christine, the way his lips part in awe of her, is very, very romantic.Emmy Rossum, who plays Christine, offers the most innocent and beautiful portrayal of her character. Minnie Driver is hysterical. Patrick Wilson is like one of the guys off of the front page of a romance novel and Miranda Richardson adds such an important role to the movie.I would like to call this a chick flick, but any guy with an open mind could relate to the passion of this movie.It's best to watch it first with the subtitles so as to understand every word. If you get the collectors edition, make sure you watch all the special features as they are just as interesting as the movie.I say BRAVO to the new Phantom of the Opera movie.	5.0	Phantom Movie is a Keeper	2005-08-04	2	1	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A30PWULVV28IR8	Paula M.	"The movie version of Andrew Lloyd-Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"" cannot adequately be reviewed in words. One must watch the film to truly understand its splendor and brilliance. Joel Schumacher, the director, excels by using camera angles and lighting to set a mysterious mood. Instead of filming just the actors, he films the set at odd angles so that the audience is sucked into the romantic ambiance of the film.Gerard Butler creates the sexiest Phantom I have ever seen (and I have seen many). To see his eyes as he gazes upon Emmy Rossum is to see with stunning clarity The Phantom's tragic love for Christine. And the deep, soulful resonance of Butler's voice fills one with emotion and sends shivers along one's spine. His co-star Emmy Rossum is stunningly beautiful. Throughout the film, she shines with youthful innocence and sings with the soprano voice of an angel. The only lead actor I find lacking is Patrick Wilson. His voice is decent, but throughout the film, he shows very little emotion and tends to make Raoul appear uninteresting and monotonous.The music in the film is awe-inspiring. Due to the number of available instruments, the film's massive orchestra gives the heart-wrenching songs of the ""Phantom"" repertoire a richer, fuller, and more powerful sound. The Phantom's obsessive love for Christine, the opera house's terrifying hauntings, Christine's youthful innocence, and the century's thrilling mystery thunder through the instruments, filling the audience with overwhelming emotions.Without a doubt, this masterpiece is my all-time favorite movie. And I would recommend it to anyone who possesses a true appreciation for brilliance."	5.0	This masterpiece is my all-time favorite movie!	2014-04-26	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A42GFMF12V7XR	Paul J. Mular	Having seen the stage play (as well as the non-musical movie versions) I looked forward to seeing this movie version.  But the magic of the stage play was not there.  The editor left in too much of the director's follies, there are many unnecessary scenes that just drag the pace down to a yawn.While the movie starts out great it loses pace after the first visually-exciting underground scene. By the second hour you are playing editor and deciding what to chop out to make a better movie.  Get rid of the cemetary scene, chop that unnecessary false-suspence underwater scene.  The last 20 minutes start to pick up the pace and you wake up for the exciting ending.As an editor, I could have made it a better picture.The voices are not as strong as those in the play, and the emotional motivations do not properly come across for the viewer to care about what is going on.  Why didn't they kill the Phantom after his first murder, they certainly had the opportunities (which were not in the original story)!	2.0	I really wanted to like this movie, but couldn't.	2005-05-06	13	5	8
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AGEY4CDIQ3C38	"Paul K. ""-PK"""	"First, let me qualify that I am not simply a fanatic of the stage show, or an ALW ""purist"".  I've only seen the stage production once, actually, but have grown up listening to the music on CD.  Yes, the Sarah Brightman / Michael Crawford music; more on that later.Also, I'd like to preface this review by saying that if you hate the stage show of Phantom, you're not going to find anything redeeming in the movie, go ahead and move on.  From this point on, I won't address whether ""Phantom"" as a whole is ""good"" or ""bad"", or who stole what from whom; but only what I though of the movie as an interpretation of ALW's musical.On that theme, it might as well be mentioned right away that there are changes.  These changes affect both the timing of the story, as well as majorly altering the character of the Phantom.  I'd like to avoid spoiling any of these, so rather than outlining them I'll simply give my overall impression of them: while it's ""different"", I don't think I could call it better or worse.  Compared to the stage phantom, the movie phantom is more youthful, more human, less magical/""omniscient"", and lacks the wicked (but very amusing) sense of humor of the stage play, as pointed out by another reviewer.  None of the other characters, however, are seriously altered. As mentioned above, some events are altered, but the changes make sense for adapting a play to fit the flow of a movie, even if some purists may be bothered by them.Visually, the movie is spactacular, (spectacular) with more than a hint of ""Moulin Rouge"" feeling to it, especially at the opening and closing of the movie.  A few scenes are over the top, but this fits the nature of the musical, so if it's already something you enjoy it won't bother you a bit and it's quite nice to see what can be done in a movie vs. on a stage.The orchestration is wonderful, for the most part.  It takes full advantage of what can be done via movie scoring, while still firmly maintaining Phantom's character as a stage-born musical.  Characters do not simply launch into song for no apparent reason, and if you know the story already everything is in there and fits into place.So then, why the middling rating?  The inescapable fact is that 2 of the 3 leads are simply not up singing their parts.  It is not fair to simply ""bash and run"", so I will describe the problems that cause me to reach this conclusion.  Emmy Rossum certainly looks the part of Christine, but that's about all I can say I like about her for the part.  She is able to sing on-key (mostly), but much more than that is required to pull off a lead like Christine.  She does not seem to project from her diaphragm, and the result is that her voice comes out shallow and somewhat nasal, with almost no dynamic range.  The more disturbing flaw, however, is a lack of enunciation; words that should be crisp and clear flow together and lose definition within the music.  Combined with her shallow voice, the effect was most unsettling and unsatisfactory to me.  Perhaps it can be considered a stylistic opinion, but my fiance groaned through all of her songs as well, so I am not alone in my assesment.Gerard Butler portrays the emotion of the Phantom quite well, so from an acting standpoint his casting is not bad at all.  His singing is simply dismal, however.  It's not that he has a bad voice, per se; but his lack of training is glaring.  He struggles to hit notes, consistantly coming up flat; notes that should be held and soar are merely loud and trail off to a gravely croak, as he lacks sustaining power.  When in his ""angry"" moments the words are spit out more than sung.  As some of my favorite points in the play are the Phantom's musical ""rants"" I found this performance especially disappointing.These issues are only made more striking by the fact that Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman have so brilliantly defined their respective roles of The Phantom and Christine Daae.  Perhaps by even making the comparison this will be disregarded as mere enthusiasm for Crawford/Brightman, but I don't see how the camparison can not be made given the history of these parts.Which brings me to the question: why not dub?  Though it seems to have fallen out of favor recently, some of the best movie musicals of all time have the singing parts extensively dubbed; indeed, Carlotta's singing in this very movie is dubbed.  Aside from bruising the actors' egos, I see no good reason that dubbing couldn't have been used to good effect for the Phantom and (maybe) Christine.Patrick Wilson, on the other hand, does a fine job as Raoul.  As the only lead with Broadway experience, this does not come as a huge surprise.As it stands, this movie is a visually stunning, solid version of ALW's production.  It is ideal for those who have not had an opportunity to see a major stage production of Phantom.  It is not, however, the stunning musical performance it could have been (and many fans are used to), and that's a real shame."	3.0	I really wish I could rate this higher...	2005-05-12	10	6	4

Now, having discovered it, I'm a complete fan!  Gerard Butler is fantastic as the Phantom; his masculinity, the power of his vocals, the physicality of his performance are all part and parcel of a perfectly realized roll.  Emmy Rossum is lovely, with a vocal range that is very pleasing.I purchased the single disc first and then went back to find the two-disc set.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2JH8JZGGD4SZO	"P. Barrett ""P.B."""	"The irony:  High-paid movie critics bashing the motion picture Phantom of the Opera, while the viewers have given it high acclaims.  Why are these guys paid again?Let me start of by saying... that no one, and I mean NO ONE can ""swoop"" a cape like Gerard Butler. With that said... here is my official review of the motion picture:While I understand why many have baulked at the movie version of Phantom of the Opera because they have been raised & succored with only the Broadway play, I would have to disagree with those who have ostracized the film.  I know the Broadway play had elements that were essential in creating the perfect atmosphere on the stage for Phantom of the Opera...some of which, the motion picture omitted.  However, there was a higher ratio of elements that the motion picture brought to life, that the play was incapable of creating, and never could have the capability of simulating.  The cinematography for the film alone set a mood that was untouchable.Movies these days are just a bunch of fluff, comedic relief, T & A and absent plots.  It is rare that a movie comes to the screen and leaves an infinite impression in the viewer's mind.  Finally, someone had the nards to stand up, rebel against cinematic-conformity and create a musical of a beloved and well-known Broadway play.  Is this dangerous?  Yes... but highly applaudable!  And not only did Andrew L. W. and Joel S. have the fortitude to bring this recreation to the big screen, but they made it ASTONISHING!  The music, the cast, the cinematography, the suspense, the emotion, the theatrical elements, the similarity between the play and the film, and the overall look and feel of the movie was Tres Chic!!And when it comes to the countless times I have read media and individual reviews rebuking Gerard Butler's ability to sing... again, I would have to disagree because I was impressed.  Sure, he is not one of the Three Tenors, or even the original ""Stage Phantom"" for that matter.  With that said, neither is anyone else in the ""Film"" from the original ""Broadway Stage Cast""... because this was a FILM... there is a vast difference between the two.  No `one' person can take the place of another in any situation.  I was proud of Gerard B. for having the courage to accept a role that required him to sing, when he had no musical background.  And from what I saw and heard... he rose above his challenges.  What he lacked in musical ability, he made up in his acting.  He was the perfect phantom!I am recommending this movie to everyone!  I recommend attending without previously reading ANY reviews.  It is common knowledge that humans are lemmings... we conform to what a majority is saying or doing.  Be a free thinker, don't let ANY review tell you how to like or hate a movie.  Don't let some stiff-necked movie critic, with a bad comb-over, tell you how to feel about something... go out and see it yourself.  Decide as an individual, be a critical thinker.  Think for yourself, and enjoy... or don't... and if you don't like it... no worries... because it leaves a seat open for me at the movies.  I give this movie a: BRAVO!!!  BELLE!!!  and  ""PHANTastic""!!!"	5.0	PHANTastic...a MUST see!	2005-02-26	17	15	2

I have seen the Broadway show three times and I am seeing it again in March. The movie filled in a lot of details that you miss in the Broadway show, such as Christine's relationship to the Countess. The backstage views give an entire new dimension to the story. While the music doesn't match a Broadway live performance, the special effects make up for this. If you can see it in Dolby 5.1, I'm sure the music would be right up there. One area where they could have matched Broadway was the  ""Masquerade"" scene.  However, instead of having it in full color, which is a great feature of the Broadway show, they have it in a subdued, black, white and gold theme.All in all, an excellent show and I intend to see it again and buy the DVD when it comes out."	5.0	Something for Everyone	2005-02-07	6	5	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AP6U1KIXK3R3L	P. Ferguson	"To start, I have seen the Phantom of the Opera on stage two times and regularly listen to the recording of the Broadway Cast, so perhaps I was expecting too much...The Good ---------- The opening of the film was amazing and really grabbed my attention. The sets were amazing and the costuming was great. They were really able to bring the world of the Opera House to life. The director very closely followed the stage production, which I really appreciated. Emmy Rossum, who plays Christine is gorgeous and does a great job for the most part with the singing. Minnie Driver does a superb job portraying the diva, Carlotta. The rest of the supporting cast were great as well (singing, dancing and acting). Now for the bad...The Bad ---------- In one of the songs, as they are traveling on the Phantom's boat for the first time, they added a very unnecessary and distracting electric guitar part to the song. Gerard Butler was a poor choice as the Phantom. In some songs, he is successful but the rest he does a very poor job on. I'm not sure why they couldn't just cast the Phantom with one of the Broadway/Off-Broadway actors who play the Phantom. Obviously they can act and sing since they perform the part night after night. Perhaps, it was felt that an actor that had been in previous films was necessary instead of a stage actor. If that was the case, maybe they should have had Butler lip-sync Michael Crawford singing the part. In addition to Gerard Butler's singing, the Phantom looks ""too good."" In the stage version, the Phantom's lip under the mask is noticeably disfigured. In the screen version, the Phantom has no noticeable disfigurement outside of the mask and is too much of a ""pretty boy.""Conclusion ---------- If you've never seen the stage version, you will probably enjoy this film. But if you have it on stage or have listened to it by the Broadway Cast on CD...you will likely be disappointed by numerous parts of the film."	3.0	Could have used a better phantom	2007-07-08	5	3	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A261ZXTXYSCRVO	"Phan ""Derrill"""	"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!! I agree with everything the kid says, I have seen it every weekend for a month and am counting down the days until May 3rd! I have yet to see the stage version, but my mom saw it and says the movie is drastically better, that she missed half the play on stage and never really got it. I have the extended soundtrack, the script book, and the original novel by Gaston Leroux. I read the novel after I saw the movie, and I must say I love Andrew Lloyd Webber's production a whole lot more. The novel is good but it is too horror-y, I like the tragic-love side of the Phantom that Webber has captured.No matter what the critics say, I think Schumacher did a wonderful job on this film. The journey to the lair is amazing (will always dream of having a sexy guy pull my down into the darkness, haha) and point of no return is one of the most electrically charged scenes I have every seen, by far my favorite.Emmy Rossum was absolutly amazing!! I am a singer myself, in fact I sang Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again for a scholarship and got the scholarship! But that's not the point. Emmy is perfect in the role of the young beautiful singer, torn between two men. In the roles of Schumacher, ""Christine's relationship with Raoul is really her romantic awakening as a teenager. But I think that her pull towards the Phantom is a very sexual, very deep, soulful union."" BRILLIANT.Gerard Butler is, let me say, *cough*SEXY*cough*, but I'm not shallow. He is a brilliant Phantom with his voice that reaches to your soul from his raspy, dark low notes to his pure high A in music of the night, he is perfect. I haven't seen Crawford, and I am sure all you adoring fans of his will say I have a biased opinion, but I am sorry. Gerry is sexy, powerful, and tugs at my heart strings.Patrick Wilson is a very good Raoul. While I don't like his character very much, I've always thought Christine should stay with the Phantom, his scene with Emmy, All I Ask Of You is beautiful and very romantic. He has a great voice, though his hair seems a tad too long.Minnie Driver was hilarious and though the operatic singing was dubbed in (which I completley understand, that stuff is hard!), her rendition of learn to be lonely is beautiful and tragic. I wish she had sung it at the Oscars instead of that stupid Beyonce.Miranda Richardson is great, she is one of my favorites, I love her accent! (she is set to play in the next Harry Potter film). Her daughter played by Jennifer Ellison is also good, although her dress at the masquerade ball was a little...um...well...lets just say she looked fake. The two Opera owners, Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds are hilarious, I love Hinds hair! (to hell with Gluck and Handel have a scandel and your sure to get a hit!)All in all, this movie was amazing and I regret having the Oscars done by Hollywood because I think that at least one musical should win something to show people you don't have to have dopey sex scenes and violence to make a good movie.Learn to be lonelyLife can be livedLife can be loved...alone."	5.0	THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA IS THERE INSIDE MY MIND...	2005-04-01	6	5	1

I expected to dislike the new characters after years of loving the London cast, but I must say that it felt like seeing it for the first time all over again.  I've seen the show on Broadway and although nothing can take the place of the magic of the stage, this is excellent in other ways.  It goes beyond the limitations of the stage and provides a rounded view of the storyline.  The first time I watched the movie it was with skeptic eyes, I've now seen the movie four times and enjoy it more each time I watch.As far as the actors, I love Patrick Wilson in the role of Raoul and Emmy Rossum does an excellent job capturing the innocence and pull towards the Phantom.  I was skeptical of Gerard Butler, although I am a fan of his acting in previous movies, but I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed his performance in the movie and also his singing capabilities.  It's not perfect, but I don't think that it's meant to be that way.  I know many fans who did not like the route taken with the Phantom character, but I found it more appealing and also more believable for Christine to fall for this character.I highly recommend this movie to anyone and advise to keep an open mind and let your fantasies unwind!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A6ZEAVRS02CN6	Phantom Addict	Although not the same as the theatrical production, this is without a doubt the BEST Phantom Film in existance.  Its the truest to the book, and has a glorious score (of course).  The full orchestral score really adds in ways that the theatrical production lacks.  However, do not expect traditional opera vocals for the leading singers.  They are not that specific 'I'm going to impress you with my beautiful voice and sing!' but more so, they focus on the character's emotions.  I found that in certain scenes, I preferred the original cast, and in others, I preferred the movie cast because of the emotion they displayed (especially Gerard).Technically, the film was alright.  There were some scene shifts I thought weren't done very well, and some parts where transition from singing to speech was awkward.  The script is rather simplistic in some instances... however the focus is more on the music. The transitions from 'modern' paris to the Opera House Paris are awkward and disrupt the rest of the film for the most part, save in the beginning and the end.A final note on singing:  Christine is weak throughout most of the songs, she really shines in 'Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again' the 'Point of No Return' and 'Down Once More/Track Down this Murderer.'  Raoul is actually very good.  He's not as deep and resounding as the Original, but he lends a soft feeling to that compliments the character.  Phantom was outstanding in most of his songs with the exception of 'The Phantom of the Opera' and 'Music of the Night' which really do require a formally trained operatic voice to sound good.  Unfortunately, these are the notorious fan favorites and thus is the reason I think alot of people were disappointed.  However, Gerard gives the Phantom a much more twisted look, tortured, and vibrant feeling.Overall, the movie is a well done one, and worth the money to add to your collection.	4.0	Stunning, But Lacking Refinement	2005-05-17	4	1	3
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1BVKUA32LKR2W	Phantom Bookworm	My mom always loved the music to The Phantom of the Opera, but I wasn't officially introduced to it until I was twelve (when it first came out). My world geography teacher had seen it and loved it so much, he decided to dedicate a week of class listening to the soundtrack and going over the story. At the end of the week, he assigned extra credit to anyone who went to see it over the weekend. I was already determined to see it because I was intrigued by the storyline and mesmerized by the music.Eight years later and it still remains one of my top three favorite movies of all time. I've seen the play on Broadway since then and have read my fair share of Phantom 'fan fiction'. The movie is pretty different from seeing it live on stage, but I've found over time that the beauty of the story lies in its ability to adapt in one's interpretaton of it. Some people like a crazy Phantom, while others prefer a softer portrayal of the masked anti-hero. Sometimes Christine is dreadfully afraid of the Phantom and in other adaptations she's in love with him.I think part of why this particular story has been retold so many times throughout the years and loved by so many is that everyone has the flexibility to see what they want to see.The Phantom of the Opera is about a young chorus girl named Christie who is receiving private voice lessons from a mysterious Angel of Music. She believes the Angel is the spirit of her dead father because he promised on his deathbed he would send her the Angel for protection, comfort, and tutelage when he passed on. Little does she know, the Angel is in fact the infamous Opera Ghost who frequently terrorizes those who don't follow his commands. He contacts her from behind her dressing room mirror, reluctant to reveal his true identity for fear Christine will shun him. He is deeply obsessed with her and eagerly awaits the day he can present himself to her as a man.The story begins when the old manager of the opera house decides to retire. The new managers, Firmin and Andre, don't buy into the stories of the Opera Ghost and refuse to be ordered around by an invisible specter. In addition to new management, the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny has become the opera's new patron. Christine and Raoul instantly recognize one another as childhood sweethearts, and rekindle their relationship. Despite the Phantom's efforts to seduce Christine with his music, she and Raoul fall deeply in love. This only manages to make matters worse. Christine, Raoul, and the Phantom become tangled in a web of passion, jealousy, obsession, and darkness.First and foremost, the music is simply divine and stays with me for weeks at a time upon listening. There is something hypnotic, exhilerating, and majestic about it. It captures the essence of melodrama and Gothic romance perfectly. I love everyone's voices, indlucing Gerard Butler's. He may not be a conventional Phantom, but I really enjoyed the rich, sensual, passionate sound of his voice in contrast to Raoul's sweet, soft one. I'm not really sure how this movie didn't win more awards for costume and design because the costumes and sets are lush, sumptuous, and grand in scale.This adaptation of the musical emphasizes on the relationship between the Phantom and Christine. Instead of being overwhelmed by her fear of him, Christine is portrayed as having a deeper, more soulful connection with the Phantom. She is in love with Raoul, but there is a side of her that responds to the Phantom's advances. Even though Gerard Butler plays more of a sexy Phantom, I think he understood the role well enough to bring the power and force required to fulfill the role. He starts out as seductive and passionate, and eventually progresses to a raging, broken shell of a man with deep insecurities. I like that despite his appealing physical qualities, he managed to stay true to the Phantom's volatile emotional core.Emmy Rossum is perfect as the naive and gentle Christine who is struggling to come to terms with her father's death. Patrick Wilson is not always the most expressive actor, but he has some shining moments throughout the film and has the perfect singing voice for Raoul. Minnie Driver was entertaining as Carlotta, the spoiled and selfish Prima Donna of the Opera Populaire. Everyone else does a very good job too!This movie is definitely worth seeing for anyone interested in musicals or in the story. It's very complex, emotional, often times sad and other times triumphant, and will leave any hopeless romantic satisfied.	5.0	One of my favorite movies of all time!	2012-12-27	1	0	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AX0WCUQ4MN081	Phantomess	I have to admitt i was a bit skeptical when i saw that Phantom was being turned into a movie, but then i saw the previews. Them alone made me dig out all of my Phantom CDs and books.When i saw it for the first time, i was amazed. Not only had they captured the spirit that i had longed for since i saw it on B-Way, but they also added new light to it by adding scenes that they were not able to do on the stage.The casting was excellant. Emmy played a wonderful Christine, capturing her youth and innocence and of course, her beautiful voice. Gerard Butler played a great Phantom, his voice was encahnting and suductive. Truly a Phantom to remember.Overall it was a wonderful movie, that captured it all. One to own on DVD for sure. I am looking forward to it's release.	5.0	A Grand Show of Emotion and Love	2005-03-24	5	5	0

I'm not a big fan of opera or musicals but this movie really caught my interest with the great music and singing. As soon as I finished watching it on PPV I knew I wanted my own copy. I found everything about this movie to be outstanding, including the settings, the cast, the music, the acting and much more.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1CIZ90FFOZTLM	phantomfan	For the record, my screen name is a reference to the stage play, and will remain that way, although I was happily impressed with almost everything about this movie.I have never been a particular fan of Sarah Brightman, whose voice is a little too thick and contrived for the young, pure soul of Christine.  Emmy Rossum, on the other hand, is absolutely perfect.  She was born to play this role, and it will follow her the rest of her life.  Not a bad thing.  I wish she had been playing the lead the last time I saw Phantom on stage.Patrick Wilson has a nice voice, and he was good enough in the role of Raoul, which is a fairly flat role to begin with.  However, the role can be played with greatness, and I would have liked to see the Broadway Raoul Jim Weitzer in this role, for he is fantastic.  I saw him when he was merely an understudy on the traveling tour, and he gives his Raoul life beyond the script.  Oh, well.  It's Christine's story, and Wilson is likeable enough to be believed.The music, with one exception, is spectacular, actually an improvement over the original 80's score.  The orchestrations are bigger and the sound is more modern, and yet perfectly authentic to the original.The story, with one exception, is almost word-for-word the same as the stage play, and being without the restraints of the stage leaves the filmmakers able to cut between scenes and do things a play simply can't do.  Visually the film is beautiful, full of the bright colors and glorious eye candy that those who have seen the play will expect.  There was even a moment during the opening scene, when the chandelier rose and the color splashed onto the screen and that magnificent score began, when I almost felt I was watching the play again.Minnie Driver as Carlotta is a scene-stealer, to say the least, and one of the best things about the film.  This was one instance in which the filmmakers got it right.But unfortunately they got one thing wrong, and that is Gerard Butler.  Although I have no complaints about Butler himself - he did a fine job, even a remarkable job in places - but he is simply too young and too handsome for the role, and while his voice is good, it is not nearly good enough.  He simply did not belong in this role.  The distorted face under the mask was disappointing too, as if the producers didn't want to mar his handsomeness by making him too scarred and ugly.  But scarred and ugly is the whole point.  The stage Phantom I saw the first time (Brad Little, who was brilliant) had an unforgettably gruesome face.  Butler's face looked like a mild case of acne in comparison, certainly not a face that would drive a person into madness and seclusion.  They missed by a long shot on that one.Nevertheless, I very much liked Butler's portrayal (it's not his fault, after all, that's he's young, handsome, and doesn't have a fantastic voice), especially during the Don Juan Triumphant scene.Overall I am very pleased with this movie, and I would highly recommend it to those who are unable to see it on stage.  Even to those who have seen it on stage, it will be a nice revisiting of great memories.	4.0	Eye candy set to music	2005-01-15	5	5	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1T9KJ46MC7LB2	"Phantomfreak07 ""Ash"""	I have to say that until the spring of 2005 I absolutely LOATHED the Phantom. My mom has seen it at least twice and has the original London recording on a cassette, and she used to make me listen to it when I was little...apparently I thought it scary. But when the movie came out, my friends were all dying to see it, and I was actually going to go along and humor them; never happened. We ended up waiting till it came out on dvd and rented it for Mother's Day (b/c once again, my mom wanted to see it).As soon as the overture started, with everything shining clean and sparkling, I was hooked.For everything I've heard against the cast (mainly the Phantom), I thought everyone was stellar. Patrick Wilson was sensitive and believable as Raoul. You could feel his chemistry with Rossum -- like they really had known each other their whole lives. On that note, Emmy was AMAZING. For a sixteen-seventeen year old, her voice was beautiful. I loved Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again. And she proved that she can hold her own with the older guys in the production. &lt;Warning> I am now going to gush about the Phantom. :)Gerry made the show, and he definitely doesn't get enough credit for it... But I'll give people the benefit of the doubt and say that this is a free country where everyone has their own opinions. Anyway, contrary to what others have said, his singing may have been overdone, but it's an opera! Opera is supposed to be over the top, people, come on! ...Plus he's so handsome that whatever wrong notes he hits, he makes up for it in some way, shape or form later in the film. Where Michael Crawford's voice held an edgy danger, Butler's has a sensual caress. Music of the Night is a prime example: Gerry purrs every verse, and makes everything flow so beautifully. Oh, and Point of No Return... no words for that one, it's so breathtaking. For both Gerry and Emmy. I'll stick with Wandering Child as my favorite song because I totally love the violin solo at the beginning, and the way his voice just seeps into you.Minnie Driver definitely stole some of the show. Memorable moment: Il Muto and the world's first croaking diva! Yay! Miranda Richardson was also a very good choice -- she was able to play both sides of the fence very well.Overall, a wonderfully cast, beautifully designed, brilliantly done film that deserved more awards than it won. Very sophisticated for a musical piece. Go see it.	5.0	Gorgeous, sensual and exquisite	2006-06-01	29	29	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3D6DWEHOTIDHU	Phantom Friend	After reading many many reviews trying to find out why some do not like the movie version, they just don't get it!  It's about the music not the acting or direction it is The Music of the Night (or day).  If you have seen a live performance, it is often difficult to see the facial experessions, the movie allows you to see it in detail.  Additionally, the stage does not allow to fully comprehend where the action is taking place and how the characters are relating to the scene.  The movie makes the action more memorable.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1Z6FZLST6E37B	Phantom Lover	"This movie is so amazing and breathtaking I can't even find the words to describe it. I'll have to say though: Christine and the Phantom are incredibly sexy together. Emmy Rossum is perfect for the role because she is young, and how Christine should be. Not to mention, she has a great voice. Gerard Butler plays the Phantom, and he is BEAUTIFUL to look at! Although he is not a trained singer like Michael Crawford from the stage version, I do enjoy his voice. He has a deeper voice, which was how I always imagined the Phantom to sound like. Patrick Wilson also made a fine Raoul. He sounded amazing in ""All I ask of you"".I think if anyone's ever been deeply hurt emotionally, you can more or less relate to the Phantom. One of the scenes that was absolultely heartbreaking to see was when the Phantom was listening to Raoul and Christine profess their love for one another through the song ""All I ask of you"". Just amazing, I tell you. It gave me goosebumps. Please don't miss it."	5.0	YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2005-01-13	4	2	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2H5MTMUD144HH	Phantom Lover	"Having seen the stage production of the Phantom of the Opera twice, I'm not sure what I expected.  But this film superceded any expectations I may have had.  It is a visual and auditory feast!  The set design is lavish and the costumes are exquisite.  I really loved everything about it.The acting was consistently good throughout.  I can't think of a single weak performance.  Emmy Rossum stands out as the young Christine who has so much thrust upon her shoulders.  But the standout performance would have to go to Gerry Butler as the Phantom.  His performance is so nuanced that you really have to see it more than once to appreciate how really good he is.  His movements and body language convey a lot about the Phantom's emotional life.  You can especially see this in ""Music of the Night"" and ""Point of No Return.""  Gerry's taken a lot of flack for his voice not being ""operatic"" but I think the producers were going for more of a ""rock and roll"" sounding voice as a foil for Raoul's perfect tenor (you know the whole good/bad, light/dark thing).Some reviewers had commented that it wasn't realistic for the Phantom to lose a swordfight, but Leroux wrote in the novel that the Phantom was weak when he was away from his source of power: the catacombs beneath the opera house.  I think this is also why he doesn't confront Christine and Raoul when they declare their love to each other in ""All I Ask of You"" on the roof.  Notice, too, that after Christine humiliates the Phantom in public, the first thing he does is grab her and plunge below.So do yourself a favor--experience this film for yourself.

This film is what made me become a POTO phan.Emmy Rossum is sexy, beautiful, and has a voice to match! Her acting is superb as well! When she sang ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" at her father's grave, I was moved to tears. So was this big, tough-looking guy sitting next to me! I recently bought her debut album, and she sounds wonderful.Gerard Butler is AWESOME(I had no idea he was scottish)as the title character. He portrays the Phantom as not just a tortured soul, but as a genius(in the musical sense)and very romantic. His sensuality and vuneralbility are exposed, and ""Music of the Night"" made me melt in my seat. Come to think of it, every time Gerry was there made me melt in my seat! YOWZAAA!! HOTTIE ALERT!! HOTTIE ALERT!!! And I was definitely happy when I saw him again in 300, even though he didn't sing. Oh well.Patrick Wilson plays a somewhat girlie Viscomte, and his singing voice is very weak, but he keeps at it, and might make some people root for Raoul in the end. I know I kinda did. He does have a great sense of acting, and portrays a good rival to the Phantom. Although I think Christine should have picked Erik.Minnie Driver just cracked me up! She portrays Carlotta as an opera singing Miss Piggy, in the words of my sister, and that's very true. I don't know if anyone noticed, but when she says ""Until you stop these things from happening, this thing does not happen!"", she points at her boobs! For some who don't know, she sings the new song that plays over the ending credits ""Learn To Be Lonely"". Her comic timing is impeccable.Miranda Richardson(Sleepy Hollow) as Madame Giry is wonderful, and I have always enjoyed her work. Simon Callow (Shakespeare in Love) and Ciaran Hinds (Veronica Guerrin) work perfectly off each other as the new managers Andre and Firmin, and the girl who played Meg Giry(I can't remember her name ^^;)was marvelous.And of course, the music is what got me hooked. The title song, Angel of Music, and Music of the Night are my favorite songs; so awesome!I am a big fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber, and this musical is an excellent example of his musical genius. Brava, Mr. Webber, Brava!Now only if they could turn Sunset Boulevard into a motion picture......"	5.0	I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2005-02-01	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1A0VAQZFWVW9R	"PhAnToM PhAnATiC ""PhantomPhan4Life"""	"First things first, I find it interesting that many ""professional"" film critics wrote such scathing reviews about this film adaptation of this classic musical when most theatre-goers loved the film. Rarely do I see audience members applaud before and after the film. Rarely, do I even see the majority of the audience sit through the entire credits, just to listen to Andrew Lloyd Webber's haunting score while composing themselves after a heart-wrenching ending. The acting is topnotch. I prefer Gerard Butler's acting take and voice over Michael Crawford's any day of the week. I mean, for the past year, I have heard much complaining about who was cast in the title role. But let's face the facts. Michael Crawford is an aging man. You didn't think he would sing the Phantom forever....did you? Now I agree that Crawford did an incredible job, and set a high bar for everyone that would play the phantom in the future. I am going to put this rather bluntly, what happens when Crawford is gone? Should we place the scores in a sealed vault to be forgotten because we don't feel anyone will ever perform the role to Crawford's standards? Need I say more.....on with the review...Gerard Butler's Phantom has emotion and so does his singing voice........while Crawford went for beauty but lacked emotion. Butler's acting is phenomenal and not getting enough credit....for instance: The scene on the rooftop when he picks up the rose that Christine dropped. The emotion in his voice and on his face is painwrenching to deal with. His sense of betrayal and loss of Christine is deeply felt. And then his desire for revenge as he finishes the song while climbing the corner statue on the roof while the director uses a close up shot and then pulls away into the sky.........both the actor and director made that scene so wonderful, not to mention the beauty of the snowcovered rooftop with more snow falling. And then in the cavern at the end of the movie, Butler's raw emotion creates a tension filled final scene. For that matter all 3 actors do a great job of expressing the anguish of the catch-22 situation. Emmy Rossum commanded attention from her opening number! Simply put, she was wonderful and I give her a well deserved A+. If you watch her eyes closely, you can really see that she is feeling everything in the right moment. She believes that she is Christine, and in love with two completely different entities. Again, I cannot see anything wrong with her performance. Of all of the Raouls I have heard, Patrick Wilson easily takes first place....by a landslide. Guess you could figure out his rating. He sang very smoothly and without error. Even his acting was impressive...Webber definitely got it right.  Wilson and Rossum seem to have a very good chemistry with the acting as well as a beautiful blend of voices.....though at times, he does seem to let the soprano out do him on some of the higher notes. But thats okay....people go to an opera to see the soprano anyways. I also have to say that I liked the fact that they added a little bit more character to Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson). She explains to Raoul how she came across a boy being beaten by a circus leader. Previously, the earliest indications of who the phantom....or rather, why the phantam is, was during the finale events. It allows the audience to feel sypathetic to a character who seems to be nothing more than a beast stalking his prey....when infact he is just like any of us...at least on the inside.For those of you who are seasoned fans of the stage production, you will enjoy this new interpretation. I find it a nice compliment to the stage show because the movie incorporates the history of the Phantom and allows the audience a glimpse of the Phantom's reaction during scenes, such as ""All I Ask of You"". The increased screen time that the Phantom receives gives even a greater connection to this tragic character.For those experiencing this musical for the first-time, you're in for a treat! The music of Phantom is beautiful and soulful. Accompany that with a visual feast and a stunning cast, this film is indeed Oscar-worthy. The music and story of Phantom has captured the hearts and imagination of theatre-goers for almost two decades now. It has endured a lot of harsh criticism before, but still remains to touch everyone that sees it. By withstanding the test of time, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" has provided itself the best review that anyone can bestow upon it. i hope this review helps you in whatever way possible...."	5.0	Phantom is Phantastic!!!!!!!	2005-12-20	18	18	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A277C581K95IV7	PhantomPhan	The movie opens in a dimly lit-candle on what looks like a black-white postcard of the opera house. It zooms into real black & white and Raoul (old and crippled) is set in a wheel-chair and brought into a ruined opera house where the auction is taking place. And a chandelier is later revealed (lot 666) and as it rises the opera-houses restores to its non ruined self in color playing to the excellent overture for THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.This is the best movie I've seen in two years (&#60;a href=&#34;[...]%20of%20the%20rings&#34; onmouseover=&#34;window.status='lord of the rings'; return true;&#34; onmouseout=&#34;window.status=''; return true;&#34;&#62;lord of the rings&lt;/a> didn't even get me this excited) I was tense throughout the whole beginning with excitement and only calmed a little by the end of Gerard Butler's excellent Music of the Night. I have to say seeing him, putting a face (well half a face) and an acting ability to that voice made it sound three times better. This guy's acting is better than the Phan's precious Crawford.Emma Rossum was excellent also, but the four best characters were Patrick Wilson's Raoul, Gerard Butler's Eric and Simon Callow and Cirain Hinds Andre and Firmin. What a delightful movie, the sets the costumes, I loved the sword fight. All the singing was superb and the new editing of Point of no Return with the chandelier and the Phantoms little models was so tense and awesome. The final scene was phenomenal (and I really hated Gerry's voice on the soundtrack for that part) Phantom really sounded good when you had that horrible face added to the growling.My only complaint would be his deformity changed every angle of the camera (and it was lighting I swear the wrinkles always were different.) Oh well. Minnie Driver was also very funny and best song was PONR along with DOM/TDTM (AKA final) Recommended for everyone except those hockey punks thinking this is a horror movie and shouting insults in the front row.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3GJZ5KBV5D6TV	PhantomPhan	I have never bothered to write a review of a movie before, but this is a great place to start. This is one of the most beautifully photographed, costumed, and well acted movies I have seen.  After having seen it 5 times there is always something new I notice.  At the end the audiences either applaude or there is complete silence. It even made my husband shed a tear which he did not when we saw the play.  This is  one of the few times you will not hear chatter through the movie.  Ususally silence . We have the extended soundtrack which gets listened to at least 1x a day and even our 3 yr old daughter can sing along and sat through the movie as well.  It is popular at my sons high school with the girls and guys alike.  Some complain it's not just like the play, it wasn't supposed to be a replica.  They wanted this one just to the side.  To expand and fill some holes that were not totally explained.  Give this one a chance, let yourself be drawn in just as Christine was and fall in love with the music.  Gerard Butler is not Michael Crawford this is true. If that is what they wanted they would have cast him.  He is a wonderful actor, beautiful to watch and his voice is his own not a copy of someone else.  Good Luck and enjoy!	5.0	Please go and see!	2005-01-23	6	4	2

Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson were fabulous in this movie (Though not flawless vocally, but do I care?

Walking into the theater, I was a bit afraid I had blown eight dollars on a movie I was certain I wouldn't like.  Yet when the end credits began to roll, I found myself grinning from ear to ear, singing along with my friends to Masquerade!  What a simply beautiful movie!  I was pleased with most of the acting; Raoul seemed like he could've had more emotion, but Gerard and Emmy did a marvelous job and had great chemistry.  Minnie Driver made me laugh out loud with her vivacious accent and drama queen persona.  Not to mention having dashing Mr. Butler as the Phantom certainly made you more biased towards Raoul;).  The sets were gorgeous, especially the scene of the Masquerade, I loved all the dancing and interesting costumes.  As for the songs, I found myself humming them for weeks after I saw the movie (twice!).  When I finally broke down and bought the soundtrack, they became permamently engraved into my brain!

I watched the stage musical when I was in my teens and then, there was this rumour that a movie was going to be made starring the originals, Sarah Brightman & Michael Crawford.  So, I waited and before I knew it, it's over a decade.  Anyhow, the wait is worthwhile.  Referring to Joel, the director, he made a right move in choosing young cast to the production.  He did it for both reasons, to broaden the target mix and also to make sense of Christine, of her trapped in a triangular relationship between Raoul and Phantom.  The movie paces along steadily and whilst it's not following frame by frame to the musical production, the adaptation is very faithful.  On top of that, it gives us glimpse of how the Phantom came about and how did he roam about in the Theatre.  It's a bit of ""Batman Begins"" strategy.  Whilst Gerald Butler's voice isn't as distinctive as Michael Crawford's, he compensates that by his dark screen presence.  Roaul's character is two-dimensional, valiant and swashbuckling.  I would have to say that to me, the outstanding performance would have to come from veteran, Miranda Richardson who's making effort to speak English with a tinge of French accent whilst others are carrying stiff upper lip English accent.  Minnie Driver is hillarious as the Prima Donna but somehow, she's no Italiano as she's depicting in this movie.  Whilst Emmy Rossum sings like an angel, her band of performance is once again restricted to being an innocent girl.  For the beautiful direction, (set) production, and may I say, soundtrack, this is definitely a DVD to keep to watch and watch again.  Such a quiet achiever.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A386194DYACG2S	"Pippin62 ""critique at will"""	"First I want to say if you're thinking this is a horror flick, forget it, you'll be bored and nasty, so don't bother.If you expecting the stage play,it's not, so check those thoughts at the door or you'll be like so many others who thought it could have been better or one of those who poo-pooed it for not being exactly like the play. I say here and now if you want to see the play, go see the play, I'm going to as soon as I can. But, I refuse to compare it to the film because it's not the film. I have to admit I get impatient with those who want movies to be exactly like the books or plays they were based on. Movies are a differnt species. They have to be adapted for the screen, things that work in a book or on stage don't always work on film and vise versa. So that being said, if you want to be entertained by an excellent story and beautiful music via motion picture this is a movie for you, it has dashing men, beautiful women and the music is, in a word, stunning.Second, if you're familiar with Andrew Lloyd Webber's work you know to expect wall to wall music with little or no dialogue. So I'm giving those who aren't sure if they really like music fair warning on this issue. It's almost entirely music. The movie doesn't need that much dialogue anyway, it sings what it wants to say, and does so beautifully. Music is the language of our emotions, especially when there are no words to say what we feel, and it capitalizes our emotions when there are words to express them. My musical being was nourished by this film, I came away blissfully satisfied and glad I'm alive to hear and experience such beauty. I was overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of this film. I cut my teeth on movie musicals and none took my breath away like this one, (musical or not). I didn't get to see the stage version but I have the original broadway cast recording and have listened to it a zillion times and have sung these songs for years. I have gone to other stage productions of musicals that were made into movies and I agree that there is no way a film can capture what happens at a live performance. However, this film is about as close as one can get to the energy and tangable vibe of a live production.Gerard Butler is the perfect movie phantom. I loved the raw emotion in his voice. I will draw a comparison here; Michael Crawford has a gorgeous voice and no doubt made the perfect stage phantom, but when I listen to the performances back to back , his voice is too beautiful for me, it doesn't have the agony and intense rage or raw seductive power that Gerard Butler has. When I hear Crawford's voice I want to say ""Oh, How pretty!"" But when I hear Butler's voice I want to...Uh... I don't think I can write it in a review, can I? When Butler sings ""Music Of The Night"" it's like gentle, seductive kisses on the ear. My ear hears it but my body feels it. This has never happened to me while watching a movie musical.Every performance was right on target. Emmy Rossum touches my soul when she sings ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here again"", I was listening to it earlier today and it prompted me to stop by my dad's so I could tell him I'm glad he's still with me and give him a big hug. Honestly, Sarah Brightman never made me want to do that, and her voice is beyond compare. So, Miss Rossum must have a way with a musical phrase that Ms. Brightman does not.Patrick Wilson's Raoul may seem a little stiff but I don't think that is an error. I think it's intentional, you know he gets the girl anyway, and I think he has to portray Raoul that way in order to emphasize the Phantom's vulnerability and to make him more sympathetic. It was smoothly calculated on Wilson's part and to me it was spot on.All in all I adore this film, it has shoved some of my life long favorite movie musicals right off the list and has made itself #1 for me. I'll be watching this movie and continuing to sing it's songs for years to come.The second disc has all the supplemental material on it and I thoroughly enjoyed the back story and all the behind the scenes stuff, but the DVD-Rom extra with the cast and crew singing ""Phantom of the Opera"" in their own special way was a hoot! I loved it!I hope you'll enjoy this picture because it is so worth your time.

Some HD-DVDs look like they might have been rushed onto the format, with picture imperfections, etc...not this one. The picture was flawless, I can't recall seeing one imperfection throughout the entire movie.  I had to turn the sound up a little louder than I am used to in order to hear it well, but the sound was magnificent as well.This is one of the cleanest and best transfers onto an HD-DVD I have ever seen.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1RUKJLPTLFJ1L	P. Mashburn	I very much enjoyed my favorite production on film.  I was disappointed to find that the regular edition was absent of special features.  The 2-disc special edition of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera is definitally worth while.  It includes Andrew Lloyd Webber's original venture into the The Phantom of the Opera as a theater production and the making of the music that moved the hearts of millions.  It includes interviews with the cast, including the mesmerizing Emmy Rossum.  I was amazed to find that the young actress, sixteen, had been in the chorus of the Metropolitan Opera House since the age of seven.  It also includes a scene and song especially made for the film, but was not put into the final product.  I would definitally recommend the purchase of this film to all those who were lost in the beauty, mystery, and grandeur of the production of the Phantom of the Opera.  Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber did a wonderful job in transforming this drawing production into a film that will be treasured for years to come.  On that note, I would also suggest the 2-disc special edition Phantom of the Opera CD.  With the resources used to make the film, the beautiful and alluring music was performed at its finest.	5.0	Mesmerizing!	2005-08-04	2	1	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AJBV1GIE67GOH	Preston Caldwell	I saw the film this past weekend for my first time.  I have seen the show 14 times and Sarah Brightman in concert also twice.  I have to say that I love Emily playing Christine.  She is the best thing in the movie.  I also liked Patrick Wilson.  When Patrick and her sing on top of the theater its great.  I think the weakest point initially is the singing of the Phantom.  Yes you do get used to him and he sounds great by the end but that initial singing calling her from the mirror after Christine's first triumph is just shocking.  He is no Michael Crawford.  But is does look great and like I said Emly Rossum is the second best thing to Sarah Brightman.  She is just amazing.  I liked the movie and will watch it again.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2SGCSIMTY6N3B	Quirkycat	"I'm slightly unusual here, because everyone here seems to have seen the play. I haven't; but the novel is one of my favourite stories. Ok, before anyone thinks 'Oh, she just didn't like it 'cos it was too different from the book', well, yes, BUT, I was all prepared to see a different plot line, and like it anyway.Well. I tried really hard, believe me, but I just couldn't get into it at all. The first scene was amazing, and brillant; the song was shiveringly great and I really thought they'd captured the atmosphere of the novel, but from there on in it just got worse. I have to say, I almost totally agree with the reviewer ''Katie ""sporkgoddess""''. Why?For one thing, the acting was really bad. Emmy Rossum, as Christine, just wandered from scene to scene with a dazed, sheep-like expression on her face (Plenty other reviewers have said this too, so it's not just me), Gerard Butler as the Phantom kept doing this really annoying thing with his cloak, like a fake overblown 'dramatic' swirl, which was actually cringe-worthy, and Patrick Wilson as Raoul was the most moany, unsymphathetic character ever. (Yes, he is a bit like that in the book, but because it's written kinda from his point of view, we can forgive him) I agree with whoever said they wanted the Phantom just to kill him and be done with it. The managers in the book (I know, I'm sorry, but this really irritated me!) are slightly stupid and a bit greedy, but serious charcters; in the film they are just comically unfunny relief. The only one I had any sympathy for was Minnie Driver, who was slightly overblown, but believe me, not as much as everyone else.And the singing! Right, I have to differ from everyone else here when I say that I thought the singing itself was quite good; but there was just to much of it! (I mean, when the managers start singing 'Oh, I got a note from the Phantom, la la laaaaa' 'Oh! Yes! So did I, what sh-aaa-l we do?!' it just gets stupid and irritating. I don't know; it might just work in the theater play, but it definitly doesn't on film.)And, yes, I'm afraid the film just wandered too far from the book - eg, why did they make up a fake past for Erik? It completely changed his character, because he's supposed to be an evil GENIUS, and to have helped design the Opera House. Plus, the sword fight was really annoying and unnecessary. But the thing that got me most, right, the thing that really made me want to write this review, was Webber's cheek in writing songs for Don Juan Triumphant. THE AUTHOR HIMSELF did not dare to do that; he simply described it as magnificent, ect, then left it to our imaginations. It certainly was not a cheesy sing-along bunch of songs ... it was much more dark and dramatic than that. That having been said, I did like the other songs, I just thought they should have replaced unnessessary singing with dialogue, then the really important songs would have stood out better.Lastly, the film was not dark, or scary enough, in my opinion. After all, it was originally meant to be a horror story - but most of the way through (from the reviews I've read here, anyway) the audience was rooting enterily for Erik! If they had stuck in the proper torture room, and let the audience hear Raoul's own thoughts about Christine, or maybe if Christine herself had been more credible, then I think the film as a whole would have been more interesting.Well, I still give it two stars, because it was nice to look at, and the rest of the songs were quite good - I DID like 'Phantom of the opera', but I think this film could have been so much better. In fact, it's put me off seeing the play, because if it's as annoying and over-the-top as this, I won't like it. Was the film really that true to the play? Please, everyone here who liked the film, can you do yourself a big favour and read the book? You won't be disappointed, I promise you!"	2.0	Oh, dear ...	2005-04-20	24	8	16
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AQR22MPF45M3P	Rachel Ford	"There were many things that I liked about this film. The acting was very well done The directing, choreography, makeup, costume, etc., all added much to each and every scene. And the score (of course) was the familiar and extraordinary Phantom of the Opera score. Emmy Rossum's Christine was a jewel -- great acting, and sublime singing. Raoul, likewise, was perfect in his part (I really hated his hair in this role, but I digress :P). All of the supporting cast delivered stellar performances as well. So why...why...WHY did they cast Gerard Butler as the Phantom? At least, without having someone who can sing (!!) perform his songs? Perhaps in a limited scope, Butler's voice would be fine; but in the Phantom of the Opera, he was way out of his league. So, you find yourself deeply immersed in the movie ... until the bellowing Phantom starts to ""sing"".  To be fair, not every thing he sings is bellowed; but he managed to ruin every song in which he had a role with his frequent bellowing. Butler's singing is my main objection to this movie, and the reason it only gets 4 stars; his acting is great, and he makes a convincing Phantom (singing aside). Everyone else did a wonderful job, so this gets a 4/5"	4.0	The (Bellowing) Phantom of the Opera	2010-05-30	1	1	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3RDZTBK0P4VVA	Rachel M. Hayes	Before I begin, I just want to say I have the broadway soundtrack and listen to it all the time. I have been trained in music and have seen the play 5 times. So I know what I am talking about.bad firstAs for the costumes and directing, it almost ruined the movie. When I first saw Roul, I thought yuck, I hated the hair and his clothes, and I love period peices. But  Patrick acting let me to at least feel pity for him. Also Christine and Megs costumes, I could not have believe them to change that often in a real play. Also there are sence where Christians dancing without a chin then has it then doesn't, when the phantom comes to get her she has light make-up on and half way down the tunnel dark make-up on, she has stocking on then doesn't. The Phantom's make-up at the end isn't the same from sence to sence. The masked ball she has her mask then doesn't. There are other mistakes that should have been caught.And I think they ruined the grave yard sence. Having Roul leave only moments after Christine and the Phantom left but showing up way later. Also I didn't like the sword fighting sence, it didn't make sence.now the goodBut the acting was great by the leading men, and Minnie, as for Emmy she did ok. though I didn't like the dancing by the back ground dancers in the point of no return. I thought they should have stayed focus on Christine and The Phantom, with glances at Roul.The emotion that Gerard put into the phantom was for lack of better word GREAT. I felt his pain and strugle.As I already commented Patrick acting had me also feeling his pain and I could soo tell that he was Musical trained.Emmy's singing was good but her acting was not up to par in one sence she looks scared then not then scared I don't know if that was the directors fault or hers. I have a feeling it was the directors.I am getting this movie and think people should see it. I only wished the directing was better.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AEYJGHIDOO6GE	rainforest	"I was totally blown away when I saw this movie. This movie emotionally grabbed me. I spent days with my head filled with the melodies such as ""Music of the Night"", ""Angel of Music"", and ""That's All I Ask of You"". I couldn't shake it off. Sometimes it is Christine's voice; sometimes it is the phantom's voice. Rarely have I found myself so completely absorbed in a movie. This is the only movie in recent years that I have watched more than 5 times. I have also read the movie libretto more than 3 times in order to thoroughly understand the storyline. The better I understand the story, the more I like it.If I could, I would give 10 stars to this movie. I haven't watched the stage play yet and after watching this movie, I plan to. But I really don't think I will like the stage version more than the movie. Allow me to tell you why I think this movie is outstanding.(1) The story: I am totally obsessed with the love triangle in this story. It's so powerful that it emotionally hit me. I felt deep compassionate for the phantom. While he was a genies, his musical talent was totally ignored just because he was deformed. He secretly dreamed of beauty, and loved a young woman named Christine; he couldn't win her love no matter what he did because he had that loathsome face. Anybody could feel his pain when he told Christine that he secretly yearned for heaven. Let me briefly recite the story. It started with a young and beautiful chorus girl named Christine who has been taught by a mysterious tutor - the phantom. The phantom was a great musician but hid under the opera house because he was a freak of nature. After Christine's tremendously successful debut performance, the Phantom fell in love with her. He also, however, felt threatened by Christine's new suitor Raoul, a nobleman who was Christine's childhood sweetheart. So he invited her to his underground lair. The phantom mesmerized Christine with his beautiful voice and songs. On the second morning, Christine demasked him and was horrified to see his deformed face. Later, the phantom committed murder in order to make Christine the leading soprano. Christine was in fear and told Raoul that she had seen Phantom. Raoul swore to protect her and they made an oath of their mutual love. The phantom overheard of it and decided to take revenge. 6 months later, while in the masked ball, Phantom showed up with his newly written opera script Don John Triumph. He appointed Christine to sing it. Christine refused to sing, but Raoul pursued her to sing since he wanted to use this chance to catch Phantom. The opera house was surrounded with police on the day of the performance. That evening, the phantom murdered the tenor and played the tenor himself. He sang with Christine in a touching, passionate way that it would make us to believe it was the Phantom who Christine loved. For some unknown reason, Christine unmasked him in front of the audience; and the Phantom took Christine to his lair and wanted to make her his bride. Raoul came to the lair to free Christine but ended up to be captured by the phantom. The phantom demanded that Christine choose between him and Raoul. Christine kissed the phantom, and the phantom was shocked by her kiss. At that point, he let Christine and Raoul leave.(2) Music: The music in this play is intoxicatingly beautiful. I haven't watched the stage play yet, but I have listened to the original London record. I think Butler/Emmy/Patrick sing pretty well, even though Sara/Mike of the London stage, in my opinion,  play sing better. Butler's voice is more like that of a pop singer, but butler can act. Some people say the director chose the wrong person, a good looking man with a bad voice rather than a bad looking guy with a beautiful voice. Being movies that are visual, who would want to see an ugly guy in the leading romantic role? If we see a 50 years old horrible looking man deeply in love with a beautiful teenager girl, we would feel so disgusted. While Butler's phantom is dark, strong and powerful, Patrick's Raoul is sunny, and sometimes even insipid, that's what Raoul should be. This makes for a great contrast between the two men and shapes their characters even more profoundly. Emmy is also my new idol nowJ She is so beautiful and has a nice voice. Her voice is not as beauitful as Sara, but she was only 16; like Phantom said in the movie, if she wants to excel, she has much to learn. Sara's voice is professional. So I suggest, if are more drawn to the story, then watch the movie. The beautiful people in the movie are eye candy, very pleasant to watch, and you can ignore their imperfect voices. If you listen to the CD, listen to Sara and Michael's music. Their voices are delightful to listen to.(3) Actor/actress. I liked the fact that in this movie the phantom is young and handsome. The phantom is a focus in the movie, and he literally steals every scene. Many people criticise his voice, but I just loved his voice. He sings with passion. Many people don't think his makeup is that bad looking, but to me, it was. I wouldn't say that his face is gorgeous. He is gorgeous not because of his face, it is because of his character.  His masculinity, his sex appeal and voice, his chiseled features of the other unmasked face, and most important, his passion towards Christine, all these together, lead us to no longer pay attention to his face.Emma is also the perfect girl to play Christine. She is young, beautiful and has a high quality voice; what more we can ask for? And handsome Raoul; no doubt, in my heart, I can't think of any other actors are better suited to play Raoul. He is bland, because that is what is needed to contrast with the phantom. If he were as interesting as Phantom, Christine would not have such a struggle deciding between them. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. I especially adore the two new managers; they have added the right amount of humor to this sad movie.(4) The setting: Eye candy. The opera house and costumes are incredibly opulent and lavish.Let me summarize my favorite stage scenes in the movie:(1) Masquerade: visually spectacular! The music, dance and costumes are fantastic. I love one particular young black and white masked male dancer dancing solo; it was fabulous!(2) The first time phantom invited Christine to his lair: The rock-n-roll style song and the mystery of the underground lair are just breathtaking. The candle scene was hypnotic.(3) Music of the night: phantom was so passionate about the music that I feel he is the king of the music kingdom; no wonder Christine was mesmerized by his music and had no fear of him at all.(4) Pass the point of no return:  Their duet is so sensationally powerful that you believe they are the true lovers. Even Raoul was hurt by watching it; I think he realized it was Phantom that Christine was drawn to.(5) Finally, Phantom sits in front of the Monkey music box whispering the tone of Masquerade, and Christine appeared, Phantom was happy to see her and only then found out that she was back to return his ring. Phantom finally sings out : ""Christine I love you."" If you are not touched at this very emotional moment, you must be cold blooded."	5.0	A movie musical to die for!	2006-07-27	7	5	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A15RYJP7YHCEF7	Ralph Paulsen	"I am not going into a long detailed explination of the script, acting, or performances, they are all what the producers wanted, and it all works very well, the film is gorgeous to look at, and the transfer to DVD is the best I have seen so far, it even surpasses the Lord of he Rings trilogy, and that is saying something, the effect is so good it's three dimentional (an almost impossible task when viewed on a 73"" screen), my one gripe, and it's a big one, is intelligibility. or rather the lack of it, there was a time when film studios and record companies went to great lengths to make sure every word could be understood, in recent years this is a rarity, this film has far to much of the massed voices recorded so that way to much of it can't be understood, considering the quality of todays recording equipment, I find this to be a disapointment, if not downright disgraceful, but at least there is an english subtitle track, which of course most likely means they know it's the only way to be sure that all the dialog is understood, complaints based upon seeing the stage production just don't fly with me, what works on stage rarely if ever work on film, if it did, Producers could save millions and just film the stage production, view stage productions filmed for PBS, of the many I have seen the only two that have been successful at it are The Merry Widow, and Oklahoma"	5.0	Beautiful film, great transfer to DVD	2005-05-27	3	2	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3FOSBM4MMUFER	Randal J. Batty	Within the first minutes of viewing this film, I realized it would be better and worse than the stage production.  On the positive side, the camera allows the audience to see the characters from different angles, and up-close.  As a film production, it's rather marvelous.  The choice for the lead singers is open for debate.  Though Gerard Butler strained to produce the Phantom's songs, he did possess a strong on-screen presence.  Emma Rosum was a big gamble by the producers.  The songs of Christine had to be modified to fit Rosum's vocal range.  The compensatory factor is Rosum's sparkling image before the camera, as well as her adept acting ability.  Like Butler, she strains to reach the highs and lows vocally, yet the more narrow and girlish range produces a feeling of sweetness and vulnerability. Overall, I enjoyed the film, as well as the performers.  I've watched Sarah Brightman filmed doing a couple of songs, as directed by Ken Russell via YouTube, and she is quite good.  Brightman looks half her age and (I believe) possess convincing acting ability.  Her voice is of such a different caliber that you simply cannot make any comparisons.  As much as I was enchanted by Rosum, I do think Brightman should have been cast as Christine.  I think the end result would have packed a lot more punch.	3.0	Interesting Film Adaptation	2011-03-21	1	0	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AJ8L5D48CSEB4	"Raymond A. Wonsowski ""r.a.wonsowski"""	First of all, before I get jumped on by nay-sayers, I've seen the musical twice, once on Broadway, once in Houston TX.  It's the best thing A.L.Webber's ever written (sorry, Cats was crap).Second of all, after nearly killing the Batman franchise and sorry films like the Client, I am aware that Shumacher does great work.  Check out Tigerland, or Phone Booth.What we have here is Batman of the Opera.While the film starts with a little artistic promise (the stereoscope effects in the intro are well done), the movie quickly becomes melodrama, poorly acted, poorly sung, poorly everything.  The leads are bland and dull.  The singing is amateurish and badly lip-synched.  The arrangement of the music is a cross between drippy-chick-flick and 80's-porno.  The Phantom is the worst of the lot.  Can't act, can't sing, and the makeup effects, when you get to them, are a complete letdown.  The lighting is either cliche or garish.  The costumes are either eyesores or look like they were out of the Victoria's Secret odds'n'ends bin.  The camera work was annoying or dull.  This is an extremely boring film.The only bright spot was Minnie Driver, but even she tended to go way over the top to the point of harpyism.I can't even begin to understand how this garbage got nominated for Golden Globes.  Then again, Moulin Rouge was lauded by critics everywhere, and I didn't get that waste of film either.Once again, 2 hours of my life I'll never get back.  If you want a decent, recent movie musical, try O Brother Where Art Thou.  Or the magnificent Ray with Jamie FoxxYou'd put your $9 to better use if you took up smoking.  Save your money for something really worth your while, like a pizza, and stay home.	1.0	Well, Joel Shumacher is back to directing crap...	2005-01-03	36	12	24
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A32YTCYRCKHXEW	Raymond Dobrovolsky	"I have a theatre and singing background, and I have many theatre friends who, basically, ""snub"" Andrew Lloyd Weber and his music.  Okay, the guy does, shall we say, ""borrow"" many bits of music from some of the great composers - you can hear many Verdi and Puccini bits in any of his shows.  But give the man his due - the music does set a mood, is memorable, and a joy to listen to.  This is very true to the setting of the new movie.  It is beautifully done - costume/sets/etc., visually very impressive, and something worth savoring on a DVD to watch again and again.  My only real negative comment is that the gentleman chosen as the Phantom did not live up to my expectations.  He simply was too ""pretty"" for the part, should have been older, and needed a more compelling voice.  Having heard Michael Crawford in the original stage role, this Phantom's voice was too rough and uninspiring.  I thing the other roles were cast very well, and sung equally committed.  I recommend the experience."	4.0	Beutifully done!	2005-03-06	6	1	5
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2LNP6JE11OHZR	Razor Queen(Witch Hunter)	"(...)I had high hops for this film during the opening credits. The rapid breathing of life into the decrepit opera house was spectacular and I felt my anticipation grow. The first musical number was superb. Minnie Driver had great character and the singer who performed Carlotta's singing was impeccable, hitting every note effortlessly. This immediately made me apprehensive, since it is Christine who is supposed to steal the show. My fears came true as soon as she opened her mouth. I'm not saying she doesn't have a fairly beautiful voice but I felt it was too thin, with not enough depth or force to give her that added oomph needed to take my breath away.  Carlotta outshines her in everyway. The actress, Ms Rossum seems incapable of pulling of a convincing performance. She didn't convey any emotion that made me care for her. Indeed I felt more annoyance. She waltzes though the film with the same deer in the headlights expression, with a fragility that make me want to push her over and watch her smash. The graveyard scene was ruined by very fake looking snow and unnecessary cleavage. I've said it before and I'll say it again, her nipples must be killing her. No one goes for a walk in the snow with that much bare skin on display.Onto the phantom, Gerard hasn't got the voice for this. I don't care how good looking he is. He screams and yells his way through the more demanding passages and is totally out of key.  One scene springs to mind when he leaps on a gargoyle and yells `&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;that's all I ask of youuuuuuuuuuu!!!' I swear my dog left the room at that point. Its totally cringe worthy, although it could be quite amusing if he was taking the piss, but he's not, he's serious and that's the problem. This guy is so awful it's funny. I actually laughed as he tried to ham it up with all that cape swirling bravado. The sword fight is pretty pathetic as well, which leads me onto Raoul. Bland old Raoul. &iquest;Do we care about him? I was actually looking forward to him drowning, except for a design flaw in the supposedly genius phantoms water trap. &iquest;That was tricky wasn't it? Heh, yeah right. But the grand moment of this film, the unveiling of the phantom, was ruined. We hear that stage guy singing about skin like yellow parchment and holes for eyes etc (I'm not quoting, this is from memory) and so I prepared my self for something horrific but instead it was just incredulity.  I believe my original statement was: ""He starts off with a little mask on, black slicked down hair, normal visible skin and then she whips it off and all of a sudden half this guys face is deformed even his hairline has receded, and speaking of hair, its now a rather sandy colour and sticks out, obviously in an attempted to achieve that `mad scientist' look It ruins the whole moment."" I was ripped to shreds for stating that. Apparently the phantom was wearing a wig. A jolly good wig that must have taken hours to apply to get the realistic hail line I'll wager. But the argument goes on: &iquest;If the phantom was wearing a wig that realistic (which I highly doubt given those times but will consider anyway) it would obviously be stuck on quite well right? Just entertain that fact for a minute, will you. The agility and speed at which she rips of his mask and wig, (although, &iquest;How did she know it was a wig?) is far too quick. You're telling me it was all off in one fell swoop. Ah! &iquest;It's the angle, you say? I think not. Freeze framing the DVD proves that. The phantoms face changes like magic in about one second. That's what did it for me. I blame the director. I'm assuming he was going for a dramatic flair. I mean if, after shed ripped his mask off(I'm assuming it wasn't connected to the wig) it would have been quite anticlimactic to have watched her stand on tip toe and attempt to yank his wig off with him yelling `&iexcl;Ow! &iexcl;you're pulling the fake latex skin off my mangled scalp to quickly! It's a special adhesive, you see. &iexcl;liquid soluble only!' You get my point. It was unrealistic. End of story. Blame the director. Anyway the film draws to a close and the phantom, after listening to Christine and Raoul rub in the fact that they are sooo happy, makes his exit through a red drape. &iquest;Where'd he go? &iquest;Do I care? Not in the least. I never cared about any of them. We have hardly any background information concerning either character to make them worth our concern. During this short life of mine I've manage to see onstage :Carmen(the Andalucian version), Cats(twice), Fiddler On The Roof, Starlight Express, The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, spirit of the dance(we were evacuated half way through, bomb scare) and a couple of pantomimes and amateur theatre company performances, all of which affected me and made me care about the characters. I've never been keen on musicals made into films and I think phantom of the opera was specifically design to be performed on a stage. I didn't enjoy this film at all. I think it was a complete waste of time and effort. I have plans to see the play and perhaps I just might feel like picking up the book in the distant future, &iquest;Who knows? But as for this film: I think the bad out ways the good, to put it bluntly, it's sh*t."	1.0	*I* didn't like it	2005-05-21	22	7	15

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2RHLGF0AU6FIF	R. Carter	I must admit, I was a bit hestitant about seeing this film.  I have never had the pleasure of seeing the musical and had only heard a few of the songs featured in the film on cd, as sung by Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman. So, really I didn't have much to compare this film to. What surprise lay in store for me! I was absolutely mesmerized by every bit of the film. I could not take my eyes away from the screen for one moment. I think the roles were brilliantly cast, the music and songs beautifully composed and performed, and the story in itself was just magical. I found myself laughing at Carlotta (who was perfectly played by Minnie Driver), feeling Christine's infatuation with the Phantom, Raoul's love for Christine, and last but by no means least, The Phantom's yearning and love for Christine. The moment he began to cry, I too felt as if my heart was breaking. It was if the movie was drawing you into their world at that exact place and time. Saying Andrew Lloyd Webber is a genius does not do him justice. I hope to see the musical version one day but, for now, the movie version will do. It's amazing how many people have seen the movie at least three times. In fact, I met two wonderful ladies at my fourth viewing (their sixth and seventh time) and feel that I have made two new lifetime friends. No matter what the critics say, this movie has been enjoyed by so many people. I think it is because alot of people can identify with one or more of the characters in some way. Maybe some were just curious and wanted to compare it to the real thing. Maybe some were just hopeless romantics, like myself, and love a good love story. Whatever the reason(s), I believe the viewers have proved the critics wrong. I urge people to see it as many times as possible while it is in theatres and then purchase the dvd. I believe this movie will be a classic.	5.0	A Delightful Surprise	2005-02-22	7	7	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A109SD38DBHSBW	R. Davis	"I have already seen it because it had a release date of Dec. 16 in Germany. Therefore, I can tell you from my own experience, GO SEE IT!Agreed, it is nothing like seeing it live. First off, a two dimensional event had to get put into two, somehow. The movie itself explains a lot more than the musical ever did, so a lot more was added than taken out. I won't say they didn't take anything out, in fact they even rearranged it a tiny bit, but there are just some things you can do on stage and not on the big screen.The visuals are breathtaking, and the music of course is as well. I've seen Phantom live 5 times and I have never managed to see Sara Brightman or Michael Crawford, and I have to say, no Phantom will ever impress me more than the one that was second-string the first time I saw it in English. That having been said, Butler and Rossum could have had a little bit more oomph, but what the voices lacked was made up for in the fact that you can actually see the actor's faces (and they are in fact very good actors). Passion and love are brought to the audience much more clearly in the movie than sitting in the back row in London.""Past the Point of No Return"" was the absolute best performance of the song I have seen yet, and the movie is worth watching alone because of this scene.Also, things that I would have thought would be tricky to do on screen, such as the chandelier in general, are mastered beautifully. I'm a sucker for eye-candy, and there was a lot of it that only added to the wonderful score.Whatever changes were made, I can forgive for the sake of appealing to a wider audience, and because Andrew Lloyd Webber did it himself. It isn't like they grasped these things out of thin air. I am rating this as a fantastic movie for it's own sake, and not as some pale immitation of the musical.

But this movie - and it's actors - belong to the younger generation of Phans, who thoroughly enjoy the fact that Christine is not disturbingly bug-eyed and the Phantom's voice isn't so shrill (don't get me wrong, I love Barnum, gosh darn it).The music is lush,  the costumes are gorgeous (though the Hannibal array should have gone unchanged, the absence of the China-man robe is a welcome sight), and the existence of another cast recording should make everyone happy.The only real downsides?1) Patrick Wilson as Raoul2) The awkward talky bits that should have been sung through3) The fact that the Phantom's disfigurement is redolent of a sunburn	5.0	What Spurred the Newest Generation of POTO Fans	2012-08-05	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A281NPSIMI1C2R	"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review"""	Gerard Butler gives a stunning performance as the moody reclusive Phantom of the Opera. His obsession with Christine (Emmy Rossum) awakens our own sense of impossibility as we watch Christine struggle with all that she can and can't control. Her fascination with the Phantom seems born of her love for her father, who she assumes has returned from the grave as an Angel of Music to guide her career.The sets and gold, sapphire and crimson costumes are especially magical, with cavernous labyrinths, an extremely ornate opera house in Paris and mysterious mirrors leading to worlds luminous with hundreds of candles where boats glide along underground rivers.If you loved Jean Cocteau's Orphic Trilogy and his movie: Beauty and The Beast, this has many revelations. This really does come across as an Operatic Beauty and the Beast with the Phantom's disfigured face more a situation of reality than a magical curse. This makes the story even more appealing because if Christine really does love him for who he is, she will not be finding out he is really a rich prince. Raoul seems so much less interesting and his character is not fully explored to any degree. We have no idea why Christine would be romantically interested except that he seems to have known her when she was a child and they have shared memories.While Gerard Butler is the dark sexy strength in the movie, Emmy Rossum presents the beautiful luminous innocence as she struggles with her emotions and comes to terms with what she truly wants out of life. Every time Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum appear together in this movie I was completely fascinated by the story and Emmy looked even more beautiful in the presence of Gerard Butler. The chemistry is stunning and when they sing together is makes the movie completely spellbinding and emotionally exquisite.~The Rebecca Review	5.0	Spellbinding Operatic Masterpiece	2006-12-07	5	4	1

I think Joel Schumacher's film is fine on many levels, especially his sense of period detail. The sets & costumes were magnificent. Also magnificent is the lovely Emmy Rossum (I remember her lovely performance in a little indie called ""Songcatcher""). The rest of the cast was fine. The finest moment has to be Rossum's ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"", alone in the graveyard, one of the only really peaceful moments. Gerard Butler was fine, and Patrick Wilson sang beautifully. One thing that often bothers me in films like this is why some characters speak with accents (Minnie Driver) and most of the others don't. (""Evita"" had the same problem; even on stage, the character of Juan Peron always had an accent.) Doesn't make sense to me. All the other reviewers have gone into plot, and stage comparisons. I won't do that, mostly because, alas, I never saw it on stage.

Andrew Llyod Webber writes the greatest music and every song adds depth and emotion into the movie. And if you actually PAYED ATTENTION to the movie's interesting plot, you would realize that there's a very important reason for everything done in the movie.Some people claim that Gerard Butler is a bad phantom. I don't understand why they would think this. His acting abilities are supurb and you really feel for him and learn to love his character. Butler is not a professional singer and, honestly, I thought his voice was terrible when I first saw the movie. However, when I watched it the second time, I realized that he really wasn't a bad singer, he just doesn't have a traditional opera voice. But it's kind of a good thing because his voice adds to the pahntom character.Emmy and Patrick did excellent as their characters. Minnie Driver was hilarious! And she sings a wondeful song at the end.

Although I feel its a bit too long (Hell, I feel everything is a bit too long) and slows down a little in the middle, I strongly recommend this musical epic.  Its a love story first and formost, a tragic tale of a love that can never be.  What makes this film work is that it doesn't try to be anything else but a musical.  It follows the play pretty well.  Suprisingly good direction from Joel (Batman & Robin, Phonebooth) Schumacher and of course that music of the night.  The score is great!  The actors, especially Mr. Butler as the Phantom is superb.

Emmy Rossum for being such a young actress did very well and I thought that her singing voice was very refreshing. Patrick Stewart also had a lovely voice,my only complaint with him was his hair it didn't go with the shape of his face. Minnie Driver was also excellent and so were all the other minor characters.  I am eagerly awaiting for this movie to see all the extras and hope that it's a double. I highly recommend seeing this movie for all these actors who some people would say did not have the experience to play these parts go see the movie don't judge without seeing it first. I forgot the mention the special effects were so fantastic that they blew me away.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1XKT2YAM42C60	Richard C. Lindner	It's easy to see why this movie is mostly rated with 5 stars even though it's not that good. In fact, I almost didn't buy the movie when I heard Sarah Brightman was not the star. It seemed to me that Mr Webber should not even consider anyone else at this point in time.On the Bonus Disc we are told that Sarah Brightman turned down the role. At first I thought it might be because of her age. Then I realized that she probably has enough money to buy her own country and a concert schedule that would surely kill any normal person. I was wrong on all counts - Ms Brightman is not only the most loved woman in the world, with every great quality you could ask for in a woman, she is also very, very smart.I purchased this movie because of reviews about how great the sets were. Actually, the sets are the most beautiful I have ever seen in any movie. That's where it ends.The story has been changed a bit but the real problem is the movie has nothing to offer. The young female lead is pleasant to look at with a good voice. I also discovered that Minnie Driver is actually a very talented actress. Other than the points I have mentioned, the movie is only average. I have played this movie on my large screen TV many times and it has put me to sleep on every attempt to view it. The last time I watched it in 15 minute sections.At no point could I find an interest in the actors, the characters, or the story, and certainly not the music. I find it hard to believe that so much beauty has gone into a movie that offers so little. However, there is a bright spot. Buy the two disc version. The Bonus disc makes the package worthwhile. There are many clips of Ms Brightman from previous performances which makes this disc is a real treasure. You can always pass the movie disc along as a gift if you don't care for it.	3.0	A Different Point of View!	2005-11-06	9	4	5

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3ICHEO78NFE4Y	Rick D. Barszcz	"Andrew, Andrew, Andrew!  Why did you totally blow the ending?  The beautiful stage ending that captures your heart, brings a tear to you eye and the spot light on the red rose just doesn't happen.  Hollywood decided to do it the Hollywood way which was plain and ordinary and has nothing to do with the original story.  The one thing i was very happy to hear (not see) was that the orginal orchestration was used and hearing this in a ditigal theatre was well worth the price of admission.  The black & white scenes i'm still not sure why they were necessary at all.  The Story of the ""Phanton"" is as old as time and if you are going to redo the Broadway musical version then stick to it.  The acting, for Hollywood, was pretty good but nothing compared to the original cast or the other casts that followed. It is really to bad that Andrew couldn't have produced this himself totally without a film director.  I really wanted to love this version and for the most part i did.  It is still worth seeing but see the Broadway version if you really want you heart to pound and be awed by the ending that brings a tear to the eye."	3.0	"""It's over now the music of the night."""	2005-02-13	8	2	6

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AMWRP4IFXWIJL	"Rivendell ""Larimar"""	This movie version of the Phantom is brilliant.  It is exciting, and visually beautiful.  The young stars Rossum and Butler bring realism to this movie.  Brightman and Crawford would have been way too old for this production and the casting of Butler and Rossum was perfect.  You cannot compare the stage version and the movie version fairly - a movie can do so much more.  The drama of the movie cannot be depicted on the stage and so comparisons are a complete waste of time.  Have an open mind and enjoy this wonderful movie.  Gerard Butler brings true masculinity to the role and is extremely believable as the Phantom - he also brings an edge to the songs with his darker and deeper voice.  Emmy Rossum is beautiful, and has a fantastically innocent voice and demeanor perfect for the role of the young Christine.  All in all a visual delight and if you give it a chance, you will love it.  As with all things artistic, an open mind and heart is a must.	5.0	Superb, a sheer delight to the eye and ear	2005-06-15	7	6	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2Z4197IXU0MSO	R. Kahn	I was totally swept away by the splendor of this movie. This was totally unexpected, since I was never a loyal fan of the stage musical, having seen it many years ago, and appreciated the fantastic staging then but didn't get caught up in the melodrama. In contrast, I have now seen this movie four times, and I can't get it out of my mind. The casting of attractive, and in the case of Gerard Butler, VERY attractive, actors made the story of this obsessional love triangle more compelling and believable. Gerard Butler's sexy, manly performance as the Phantom was the glue that holds the story together, making Christine's attraction and Raoul's uncertainty believable. Anyone who whines about the Phantom not being ugly enough, or the music not being operatic enough, or being too operatic is totally missing the point. I recommend this movie more than anything else I have seen this year.	5.0	Beautiful and unforgettable	2005-02-03	7	6	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1GZ6FT1RTL2M6	R. Laser	I was fortunate enough to see the Phantom on stage with Michael Crawford.  The pagentry, emotion and music were unbelievable - to date, I've seen nothing to compare.  I was very excited to see the movie and hear that beautiful music all over again.  I am happy to say that I was not disappointed.  The movie adaptation was excellent with the same pagentry, emotion and music.  It had a fresh new twist on the play I saw so many years ago.  I felt the casting was excellent.  Emmy's voice was beautiful and pure.  Gerald Butler's Phantom made it hard for me to understand why Christine picked Raoul.  It's true that Butler isn't Michael Crawford; nor do I want him to be.  He had his own unique style that made for a powerful character full of emotion.This movie version is in my collection as a classic.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ACAV6HZSJGUR1	R. MacTaggart	How should a movie be judged?  By the play/movie/book that preceded it?I think not.The play was significantly different than the book and previous film versions but few complained.Let's judge the movie for itself:1) I love the camera work.  We the viewers are offered the opportunity of giddily flying through the opera house time and time again.  I love the scenes backstage and the many flickering gas flames.  I love the fluid movement during the scene where Carlotta gets into her pink dress - it floats down upon her.2) The movie works BECAUSE the Phantom is, well, hot.  His age is in his favor (he COULD be Christine's father as opposed to her grandfather).  As well, his appeal creates a convincing tension for Christine and we the viewer can understand her inner turmoil.  Should she run off with the handsome blond or with the dynamic stranger who is a natty dresser, has an incredible, ah, lair, and is a genius to boot?  His deformity makes him additionally appealing - one's heart goes out to him.3) The over-the-top sets are visually rich and enjoyable.4) Emmy Rossum has a SUPERIOR voice and is enchanting to look at.  Compare her voice - and the excellent pacing of her songs - with the play soundtrack.  I know this is heresy but Rossum is better.  Sorry fans.5) The orchestra is much larger and as such richer.6) Gerard Butler is, as mentioned, a very sexy Phantom.  His voice, while not opera quality is nonetheless powerful, deep, and commanding - a perfect Phantom voice.  After watching the movie several times, Michael Crawford (I know this is heresy) sounds like a teenager on the play soundtrack.  Sorry fans.7) Is the movie perfect?  No.  The sword fight is absurd and unnecessary.  The fall of the chandelier should have been better (watch Disk II for a better scene of the infamous fall!).8) All the versions of Phantom suffer from the following but few if any have commented: each of Christine's suitors treats her like an object and a child.  Even though the Phantom got my vote as The One To Run Off With in the movie, I fantasize about Christine dumping both guys and seeking a man who didn't objectify her!	5.0	Tragically Underrated	2005-12-01	1	0	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3LPQAPU2ILDD0	R. McRae	"After seeing various cast changes of this Andrew Lloyd Webber masterpiece on stage 4 times, I awaited this film's release with great anticipation. The funny thing about ""Hollywood"" they either improve upon the stage production, or like this disappointment leave much to be desired. Whatever happened to spectacular film makeup? This Phantom seems strangely hampered by very minor scarring. This is not the classic grotesque Phantom we know from prior films and stage! And with the geeky hairstyle given to Patrick Wilson, the actor portraying the romantic lead of Raoul, it seems almost a shame he was chosen by Christine over the much handsomer Gerard Butler.Emmy Rossum makes for a very passable Christine, though her vocals were not quite as strong as some of the stage performers in the same role. A beautiful young presence with what should be a long career in films. The graveyard ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" scene is one of the most visually stunning; however, with so much of Ms. Rossum's cleavage exposed, during what was a rather wintry scene, the actress seemed noticeably unaffected. BRRRR. The same was true with her and Raouls roof top duet. And how could the Phantom lose in a duel of swords to Raoul? Kind of takes away from the mystique of his character. One of the more spectacular numbers, ""Masquerade"" was somewhat over choreographed, rather than the more free spirited stage productions. Each actor seemed ""rehearsed and ready"" for their big closeup. And the choice of black-and-white costumes for that scene left much to be desired over the colorful originals. Dull even. We could  also have done without the flashbacks of the Phantom's dreary childhood.There were some strong supporting cast performances, namely Minnie Driver as Carlotta, though her singing was dubbed. Overall, an average film  adaptation of an extremely wonderful stage musical, though beautifully photographed. Unfortunately, not uncommon with Andrew Lloyd Webber creations when transfered to film. See the stage version if you haven't already had the opportunity. Much more entertaining."	3.0	Just Okay	2006-12-13	5	2	3
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3V878BQ65A3Z6	R. Miller	I viewed this film for the first time last night, and was both impressed and disappointed, in that order.Impressed, that the director and designers were able to capture the lavish look and feel of the stage production and use their medium to add their own embellishments (the transformation of the opera house was especially evocative.)  Impressed, that lyrically, the film kept mostly to the orginal libretto, with only minor alterations (spoken lines instead of sung, and the regretable lyrical changes that have evolved over the years.)  However, this is where the disappointment sets in.Most of the acting is incredibly stiff, unemotional, and downright dull, with the notable exception of Minnie Driver who, as the prima-donna, Carlotta, is able to convincingly portray the actress as over-the-top in life as on stage.  It is also worth noting that Carlotta's singing voice (the only one dubbed in) is also the only one truly up to the challenge of this operetta.  Musically, only the phantom's voice seems able to carry the passion and presence of the music, and that only for about half the movie.  Christine, whose voice is exceptionally pure and lovely, does not seem to have the strength or training that is required to truly carry the role.  Her voice is often stretched, thin, and strident, and she sings without passion or expression.  Speaking of expressionless performances, the actor portraying Raoul takes his performance to new depths of mediocrity.  His voice is as wooden as his emotions, and I found myself secretly rooting for his demise; hey, the filmmakers took a few liberties, why not add one more?In terms of major changes, the phantom's backstory, changed both from the novel and the stage play, added very little to our understanding of the character or his motivations, and only succeeded in causing those audience members in the know to roll their eyes and sigh heavily.  The most glaring oversight by far,however, was the missing chandelier crash at the end of act one, forcing yet more banal lyrical changes in act two, and lessening the impact of the chandalier's eventual fall by making it look like an accident and not a cunning act by the phantom.Overall, the movie presents a visually stunning, lyrically faithful adaptation of Webber's stage production, but fails to capture the power and passion of the stage production.  I recommend it to those who have never seen the stage production, or who love the story so much, that they are willing to overlook the film's flaws.	3.0	(Mostly) Faithful, but Musically Disappointing	2005-06-09	12	4	8
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1378OG00EZQFO	R. Montross	"The point of a musical is ""MUSIC"".  The Phantom of the Opera is filmed beautifully. The story (even with modifications) is good. The orchestra and orchestrations are terrific. Even the direction I can accept. BUT, the singing!!Carlotta's dubbed voice -- operatic and good.  All other leads -- ??????  What are you folks doing?  Millions in production costs and your lead singers? -- Nice to look at but can we sustain a note without voices cracking?  Round those tones, sing like you mean it!I'm from Boston and there have to be 500 actor/singers who could have fulfilled those roles. Go to New York or London and there are thousands.  Whoever cast those roles should be ashamed.  (It's of course possible that the ""casting director"" was not the person who cast the leads, so I won's jump on that person.)  But if you're going to dub Minnie Driver's voice, they should have dubbed all the leads.  Is Marnie Nixon still available?"	3.0	rmont	2005-08-15	10	0	10
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1XZJ32DJS8YV2	"R. M. Williams ""just an avid reader"""	The usual acclaim.Absolutely beautiful, inspiring, uplifting music. I had tears in my eyes within the first 15 minutes. I've appreciated A.L.Webber's music since JC-SuperStar, this along with Evita are showcases for his technique. But i'm not really interested in music, i dwell on ideas.From the top it is the battle of Good and Evil, Light and Darkness, Heaven and Hell. big deal, lots of movies and great amounts of literature are about this theme.What is fascinating about PotO is how it leads into what we find persuasive and compelling.Good has no character development, it seems almost absurd to think that Christine would choose the calvary officer. He is just a pretty boy from her pre-opera days.It is only the character of evil that is developed, and he grows as he teaches and shapes his progeny, the beautiful young virginal white untouched untested unknown singer.Evil is talented, busy (just lighting all those candles, to say nothing of moving the huge pipe organ into the catacombs and teaching himself how to play and write music for it) a genius with just a little baggage. Evil is seductive, Christine is forgiven for loving him since he goes to her at night, in her dreams. Evil is in control, dictating conditions to the owners of the opera house, demanding a weekly salary, possibly the real author of all the great pieces performed there. Evil is of course, defective, but it is not his fault, he was born that way and mistreated until he snapped. His outrage at mistreatment, his hatred of the world above is understandable and forgivable. Not a critical character fault, but a birth defect. His ugliness, his face is repulsive but people's response to it explains and excuses the stain of evil on his soul. His genius, his musical talent, his moody and provocative music is the good result of his brooding on evil and his alienation from the rest of mankind. It is not that evil chooses to wallow in sin, but that sin is unjustifiably forced on a young boy who just responses as we all would. He is excused.As modern people we find this persuasive, we find it beautiful as the female voice intertwines and weaves just above the deeper male voice. The music's point and counterpoint dance just asEvil wanted their bodies to dance and intertwine on his swan bed. But he wanted to seduce her, a willing mate, not to rape her. With his voice, with his talent, with his music he wanted to substitute for the face that repelled her, to attract her soul, her beautiful heavenly voice to his underground grotto leaving the naturally lighted world and her potential good lover on the roof. Neat stuff, things we identify with, things we see internally and would dearly love to be seduced by ourselves.This is what i personally find so interesting, the compellingness of the vision, that evil is beautiful, that inspiring music is gorgous despite or even best of it's origin in pain. That talent, that genius no matter how twisted, no matter how murderous is a value to be sought after. It is not really a battle of Good and Evil, for good is simply palid and uninteresting compared to evil, is is a battle to yield to evil, be be allow to submit without loosing innocence. How to be that beautiful virgin in white after spending the night below, the morning after untouched by evil itself just wrapped up in the beauty of it's genius, and that is excusible. She pities evil, she overcomes her repulsion of his mask off, she recognizes not just the beauty of his music, the debt that her gifts owe to him, but most of all she knows that even though she outwardly chooses good (raises a family with him) evil will always return to her in her dreams. and in her music. for no one recognized or tried to develop her gifts but evil did, she owes him all her voice and her success.nice, literary, complex, beautiful. the best of art.it is a window into our souls and what we find persuasive as evil and the battles it plays in our lives	5.0	a window into our souls	2005-05-09	5	3	2

Butler gets through the songs....kind of barely.  I expected someone with a voice.  My mistake.  That must be why the Blue-ray disc was under $10 at Barnes Noble.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AUM3YMZ0YRJE0	Robert J. Crawford	I got this for my daughter, who as a singer loves musicals. We prepared by watching the early Lon Chaney version.  The story retains much of its magic in the ALW version:  the lonely misfit of talent, pursuing his art and mixing it with love, and becoming an insane murderer to realize his visions.  Then there is the brilliant ingenue and her chance at love as well as an entrance to the proper society, whose tragic origins lend her a natural sympathy for the misfit, who is helping her career.  SHe must choose, in a way, between artistic excellence with much insanity and life.My daughter had very interesting criticisms.  First, the story is rather rarified.  This ALW couldn't change, so he did a good job at romanticizing it in spite of this limitation.  Second, while the music is very nice, it is rather repetitive, essentially the same melody through just about every song.  When I listened carefully, I realized this is true.  Third, two of the singers - the Phantom and the Aristocrat love interest - are both mediocre singers and not very good actors.  Even I, with my less trained ear, would cringe every time the Phantom sang.  It is the biggest failing of the production.That being said, there are many things that work in the production.  The ingenue is really excellent and has a wonderful singing voice.  She is a first rate talent, it would appear.  The set is also very well done, with the Paris Opera in the belle epoque.  Though repetitive, the music is beautiful and has stuck in my head.  Finally, there are many good characters, from the nervous producers to the complicit ballet teacher, making the story entertaining.Recommended with these caveats.	3.0	a very nice piece that is marred by a mediocre production	2011-04-20	1	0	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2TYJ5W3TLWK96	Robert S. Moyer	"* Spoilers Warning *As a fan of the stage production I wanted to embrace the Phantom of the Opera movie much more than I did.  What was done well can almost entirely be traced back to Webber and the stage production.  The music is there in all of its pop majesty as are the flowing costumes and set pieces.  That was enough to make the show a worldwide sensation.  Why did the filmmakers feel that more was needed?The movie opens with, and is interspersed with flash forwards and flash backs that undercut, not enhance the story.  Why give the origin of the phantom?  To make him more human?  He isn't supposed to be human.  He is supposed to be the embodiment of music; one that demands devotion and love from those whom he seeks out.  He is a jealous force that would kill anything that interferes with his disciple's complete dedication.  He is not a circus freak.I also disagree with the symbolic use of a clockwork monkey music box.  It was used in this movie much like the ""Rosebud"" sled was used in Citizen Kane.  But by focusing on this symbol, the true icon of the show - the phantom's white half mask - was reduced to a costume piece.Finally, the movie ends at Christine's grave.  What purpose does this serve?  Aside from a date and a title, we know nothing more of Christine than we did when she was ""saved"" by Raoul in the catacombs.  Did she continue with her musical gifts?  Why or why not?  Raoul leaves the monkey music box with her - but it wasn't hers and she barely interacted with it.  Is this Raoul's way of returning the phantom to her?  How did he know that it was the phantom's music box and not some random prop?It would have been a better movie - and better served the source material - if they would have just stuck to the stage show.  As is was, they added extraneous, and in some cases erroneous, material to the story and as a result muddied what could have been a remarkable screen adaptation."	3.0	A Missed Opportunity	2007-12-09	3	3	0

The designs are truly glorious and the huge orchestration is a treat. Unfortunately for those of us who've grown old with Michael Crawford's astonishing vocals, Gerald Butler doesn't quite measure up. But he looks good in a mask and cape and will probably make a fine James Bond when he gets around to it. However, on the plus side, Ms. Rossum is younger, sweeter and a lot less icy than La Brightman. And Patrick Wilson is always a gift to any musical - one of the sweetest lyric tenors in the business. So don't bewail the fact that this isn't a filmed version of Hal Prince's fine production - that kind of thing never really works anyway. This a new vision and an opulent, grand and beautiful one that manages to maintain the over the top romanticism that makes Phantom such an icon of the musical in our time. (As director Shumacher is quoted as saying ""Nobody ever paid for under the top."")And the extras are fun too! It's always fun to get to see and hear Cameron Macintosh opine on the biz.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AK1OBVI54SY73	"Rocky ""Raquel"""	Honestly I think this movie seemed more of a comedy than any tear- jerking musical. And you probably assume I do not watch musicals but trust me I have seen a few musicals and a few of them were a lot more entertaining than this one. This is the show so widely praised all this time? Please, the story is by itself interesting enough to watch once, but the way it is played out, no catch that, dragged out, was boring, cheesy, and overdramatic. I mean I'm not a huge fan of musicals anyway but nonetheless I have enjoyed a few and this was not one of them. I just wanted to watch the Phantom because well I assumed if all these people kept saying it was wonderful it must have been. A common mistake I hate making.My friend says that the old one is different and I really hope so because getting to the end of this movie was exhausting. They just would not stop singing about every single thing and what would be a normal five minute conversation they made like ten minutes longer by singing it out and that is why the movie felt like it was being dragged out so slowly...I don't know, it just certainly was not an interesting movie to me nor entertaining. I found myself and my friend laughing at this movie more than anything, and also rewinding through a lot of the what we considered unnecessary singing.Why you wonder, if you're still reading this instead of angrily going on to another post possible Phantom fan, did I not so harshly give it a one star instead of an actual two star review? Well there was one thing I absolutely loved in this movie that unfortunately couldn't save the film but nonetheless kept me till the end and that was indeed the picture itself. The movie itself, the setting and the costumes, were gorgeous and I thought almost every scene in the movie was magical and lovely by sight. I loved looking at the movie definitely. But hearing it, and trying to keep interest in it throughout the long painful process of their constant prolonged singing, was too much. I don't think I could ever watch that story again, I don't care if there were other versions of the story, this movie just killed my interest in the Phantom plot.I watched it once out of curiosity and I think that's it for the Phantom and I. I know this movie has excellent reviews, but I feel I need to speak out for the people, and I know there are a few including my friend, who did not think of it so highly.	2.0	I Laughed Throughout This Movie More Than Anything...	2005-08-14	12	4	8

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"""Opulent"" is the defining term for ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" Joel Schumacher's lavish film version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber mega stage hit from the 1980`s.  Based on the novel by Gaston Leroux, the film tells the story of a mysterious, masked specter, his face disfigured from birth, who haunts a Paris opera house in the 1870's.  Embittered by the treatment he's received all his life from a callous, cruel society that could never see past his physical deformity, the Phantom lives an isolated, lonely existence in the rafters and bowels of the theater until he falls in love with a beautiful young ing&eacute;nue named Christine whom he both inspires and terrifies with his actions and demeanor.The original production relied heavily on feats of stagecraft and theatrical legerdemain - the boat rowing across the stage, the chandelier crashing to the floor - to wow its awestruck audience.  Since such special effects are de rigueur in the world of film, Schumacher has had to retain much of the theatricality of the original to make these moments work as well here as they did on the stage.  This he achieves through the use of elaborate, larger-than-life sets - soaring architecture for the scenes above stage and cavernous causeways for the ones below.  Yet, Schumacher keeps it all reasonably cinematic through fluid camerawork and an occasional excursion into the great outdoors.Like most musicals, ""Phantom"" rises or falls on the quality of its score.  Although many have noted that the songs all tend to sound the same after awhile, this criticism does an injustice to some of the really stirring melodies Webber has come up with.  Although a few of the pieces do, indeed, feel like filler, the music, on the whole, perfectly captures the high flown romanticism of what is, let's face it, a pretty florid piece of Victorian melodrama at its core.  Needless to say, the songs are impeccably sung, with Emmy Rossum's clear, shining soprano a thing of beauty.  Gerald Butler as the Phantom and Patrick Wilson as Raoul, his rival for Christine's affections, both lack charisma as actors, although Butler has a few touching moments at the end (Wilson, on the other hand, has been stuck playing one of those bland, white bread hero types Victorian audiences seemed to adore so much, so, unlike Butler, he has little or no chance of redeeming himself at any point in the movie)."	4.0	impressively mounted adaptation	2005-11-27	2	1	1

Yes, the movie is a bit different, but not in a bad way at all. I LOVED LOVED LOVED the movie. The cast, especially the 3 leads - Christine, the Phantom, and Raoul - were superb. I could not believe that Emmy Rossum who played Christine was so young (18 or perhaps younger, I'm not sure when they started filming). All three sang beautifully, especially Christine. And the sets! They were excellent as well. I reccomend this movie for ANYONE; I dragged along my younger brothers (14 and 8) to go see it with me, and they both agreed with me how great a movie it was. I ended up seeing the movie twice so far - and had to go out and buy the soundtrack as well. I have the songs stuck in my head day in and day out (which is a good thing). You should all DEFINATELY go see Phantom of the Opera, and then go buy it when it comes out on video.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A10DRJL3NJ4NCC	R. Tan	If THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA had been made before Moulin Rouge or Chicago it would have been more deserving Oscars awards.With so many memorable songs, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is Andrew Lloyd Webber's best work by far. Since Phantom, however, his musicals Sunset Boulevard, The Beautiful Game, and most recently, The Woman in White, have been less then memorable; you can hardly recall a humable tune.THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a beautifully made film and it is sure to stand the test of time. Of course, it would have been wonderful to have Michael Crawford star as the Phantom, but no point crying over split milk. Gerard Bulter is a great alternative choice and he has added a certain sexual tension that I haven't seen in other Phantoms. However, I think most would agree with me, if the Phantom is so attractive like Gerard why would Christine go for Raul?Butler's recording is adequate but I did find myself holding my breath when he reached his high notes and that does distract me from the film. As for the female lead Emmy Rossum, she was an understandable choice.  As much as I like Sarah Brightman's voice, the part is for a much younger actress, especially when one's face is magnified so many times on the screen. I read in an interview that Emmy said she was too big for the small screen ( TV ) . She did look good on the big screen and she can sing too. Both Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry and Minnie Driver as Carlotta were perfectly cast. ( I am only disappointed that they gave Minnie the chance to sing the new added song at the Oscars. But that's show business for you ).At the opening of the film, when the stagelights came up and the first few bars are played, I hadn't felt so excited in a long time. Joel Schumacher did a fantastic job in directing this film . It is beautifully made and my only complaint is Phantom's face (  his scars ) is not very consistence.I hope this film will not discourage film makers from investing in more musical films such as Sunset Boulevard. But this time please use one of the star from the musical. In this case, Glen Close, is the perfect `Norma'. She was acclaimed for the role, and while a little young perhaps, she is bankable and she has the voice.I will be watching THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, the film, again and again. And I hope when you come to London you will go and see this forever number 1 West End musical. For more details go to [...]	5.0	Love the film. That's all I ask of you.	2005-04-17	6	4	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1JUYF5D6TFFHB	"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya"""	"Joel Schumacher's film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's most famous musical, Phantom Of The Opera, is in theatres now and deserves Oscar recognition. It is without a doubt an incredibly powerful movie. It packs a visual splendor, beautiful musical score and emotional ride that so few films do. To many, mistakingly, this film is only a ""movie musical"" or overdone, lavish nonsense. It's not. I have seen this movie several times and each time, there is magic  to be noted in every detail. First of all, one must seperate themselves entirely from the Lloyd Webber stage musical, which first appeared on Broadway back in 1986. Sarah Brightman starred as Christine and Michael Crawford as the Phantom. THIS IS NOT THAT VERSION. While to many that is the ultimate and musically, it is superior, this one, starring Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler, is a glorious modern, youth-oriented ""movement"" towards the performing arts as cinema.It uses the latest in visual effects and sound to make a musical much more than a musical. It becomes a powerful, striking emotional romantic tragedy with theatrical roots.Seeing this film has made me appreciate the musical as well as the cinema with historical/musical background. Lloyd Webber has already used cinema to promote his staged Broadway shows- the first being 1974's Jesus Christ Superstar. Schumacher captures the real Phantom of the Opera in its essence. There are things that movies can do that staged plays or musicals, operas, can never do. Subtle things reveal powerful symbols or emotions. In this movie, it's a portrait of a tragic figure- the Phantom. Born a freak, showcased shamelessly in a circus which results in his father's suicide, the Phantom is rescued by the kind-hearted Madame Giry, the ballet instructor, who hides him under the Paris Opera house. He lives isolated in the deep caverns by the lake under the theatre, listening to opera and music his whole life. He develops creative talent for composing music himself. Anonymously, he trains Christine to sing his music. Eventually, when Christine is a star, he falls in love with her, though there is a teacher-student relationship in the center of it. Through Christine, he is a better man and less a monster. She makes him feel love and the warmth of human kindness. Through her singing, the world hears his soul, which is both passionate, intense, painful, romantic, sensitive and bitter. Christine is in love with Raol, a young aristocrat who was a childhood friend. The fact that at the end, even after a scary attempt of keeping her for himself, the Phantom releases Christine and allows her to marry Raol, shows how much his love for her has changed him. This is one of the most moving romances I have ever seen, though it shares in that same theme with another French novel, Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame and even slight elements of Beauty and the Beast.Visually, this movie is unsurpassed. It's likely it will win Oscars for Best Costumes or Best Song (Minni Driver's own song ""Learn To Be Lonely""). The use of computer graphics and original sets to imitate the Garnier Paris Opera is exquisite. The chandelier, the rose, the Phantom's mask, the toy monkey, are all powerful romantic symbols. The acting is top-notch. We have here Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry, totally devoting herself to the role. Gerard Butler's Phantom carries most of the weight. He is as powerful and frightening as he is tender and vulnerable. We see through his ""shrine to Christine"" that he is obscessed with her. We see through Christine's facial expressions that she is probably more in love with the Phantom than with Raol, but being a public figure, or wanting children (she becomes a mother) she cannot live a happy, normal life with an ostracized figure like the Phantom. The cinematic treatment of using black and white as the present day for the older Phantom who has outlived Christine and is remembering in full color memory all the events of the story is wonderful.Emmy Rossum as Christine is a treat. Her light voice pales in comparison to the more dramatic-lyric, bigger voice of Sarah Brightman, but Rossum holds her own. She was educated in opera at the Metoropolitan Opera Chorus in New York City with Eleanor Doria, who still instructs young children and young adults in the world of opera. Though she is essentially a lyric coloratura, she can deliver a powerful performance charged with raw emotion. Minnie Driver as the stereotypical bitchy, arrogant and bossy diva Carlotta is a riot. She gets a lot of laughs. Her voice is dubbed by a different singer whose own dramatic, Maria Callas type voice is used for comic effect. This movie has everything. It's both light and dark, funny and tragic, powerful in its melancholy beauty and will haunt you years afterward, casting a spell of enchantment that so many few films do today."	5.0	The Phantom Will Win Your Heart	2004-12-30	6	5	1

This film adaptation of the stage show is wonderfully accurate, and gorgeous to look at.My favorite part is definitely ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again,"" when Christine sings in the graveyard, walking through the silent snow.  Emmy Rossum has the voice of an angel, singing Christine with great prowess, especially considering that she was only 17 years old during the filming of Phantom.  The only critism I have for the film is that Gerard Butler is not a very good singer as the Phantom.  This is quite significant, since he sings a lot, but his acting performance is very good, and the amazing Patrick Wilson's Raoul makes up for Butler's shortcomings.Excellent movie, fantastic DVD."	4.0	Great movie, awesome DVD!	2005-10-02	4	2	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A5ZPFOTZAB1ID	"ryan ""King"""	"This was my first time experiencing ""The Phantom of the Opera"".  My mom owns the tape of the original stage version with Crawford as the Phantom, yet I hadn't heard this amazing music before now.I'll basically explain the story in modern day terms: a deformed man trains a young girl to sing beautifully, then falls in love with her.  Then she basically gives him a one night stand in his lair and runs off to marry Raul, her childhood sweetheart.  The Phantom was the real victim of this film, no matter how evil and disturbing he acts.  Gerard Butler, who was in a rock band and starred in smaller roles, brings the Phantom alive in this film.  In my personal opinion, he does a better job of portraying The Phantom then Michael Crawford did.  His singing may not be great, but it's the emotion in his voice that will literally hypnotize you.  You feel the tremble in his voice when he's sad, the anger when he's enraged, and the romance when he's sensually trying to whoo Christine.  Speaking of her, Emma Rossum gives a great performance as the star of the opera.  Her voice is amazingly beautiful.  Raul was the one I hated most in this film.  While his voice is amazing, the character seems like an arrogant punk compared to the more adult Phantom.The film itself left me speechless all the way through.  It's obvious that The Phantom was supposed to be the real star of this film, and that doesn't bother me at all.  In my opinion, he's a character people can relate to.  The sets and wardrobe were all just amazing.Basically, check the film out.  It's worth it and I think it's one of the greatest films I have ever seen!"	5.0	AMAZING!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A61WRN3Y04WU8	"Ryan L. ""Ryan Lattanzio"""	"I count myself as an obsessive ""phan"" of the original stage production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's lavish musical The Phantom of the Opera. In fact, since I was about four years old. It's grand, over-the-top, whimsical, dark, magical, and glorious all at once. To capture this on the cinema screen is understandably a very difficult task, especially for mediocre director Joel Schumacher, who has steered the project in a theatrical direction--but his dark, dense visual style can still be seen (you'll find some similar photography in this and even the later two Batman films). This film has been hyped for over a decade, so does it live up to its expectations?Yes and no.The Phantom is obviously a film that bluntly overreaches to redeem award-worthy success. But that's sort of what I liked about it. The whole film is over the top and extravagent like Webber's original version--and since he was on the wagon for this film, too, it essentially works. I noticed that writers Schumacher and Webber played around with the chronology of the story, too, adding some elements, changing the scene where the chandelier falls (quite successfully it is one of the best scenes I've watched all year). All of this kind of reforms, in some way, the minor shortcomings of the stage Opera. Here's the problem, though: none of it seems to fit in the limited aspect of movies. It's less open, and many of the musical numbers, while candidly well flowing, seem almost too claustrophobic. Does that detract from the overall viewing experience? Not a whole lot.To briefly sum up the story, we begin with an opera house. Numerous operas are performed by the company, and they are grand, beautiful. But the skulking Opera Ghost (or the Phantom) lives in the shadows of the opera house, deep below the floors in a creepy lair. He has haunted it, and exploits its people because of his scars--not just emotionally, but physically. What he's hiding under the mask is rather hideous (although the silent picture Phantom was scarier). Not only does he reign over the operas, but he comes as the angel of music for chorus girl Christine Daae (the beautiful Emmy Rossum from Mystic River), who is in love with Raoul (Patrick Wilson), a former childhood sweetheart. Her voice is beautiful, and stirs within the Phantom (Gerald Butler) to the point of no return, where he takes on an almost stalker-like persona.All of the supporting players, including Miranda Richardson and the surprisingly scene-stealing Minnie Driver as soprano LaCarlotta, are well cast. It is the two leads that had me worried, Butler more so. I doubted Rossum in the film's first stretch, but by the second act she had me convinced. She seems a bit young for the part, and almost too nimble and innocent. Her voice is great, but it doesn't seem to really fit for the naive character that was written. I still see her performance as lovely, but nothing Oscar worthy. There is too little dialogue and not enough conversation to give any of these actors a lead in the Oscar race.Gerald Butler is a frank miscast for the Phantom. His tenor vocals feel strained, and he doesn't really give off the impression that he can inhabit the skin of the character--or the capacity of the character's creepinees. Butler seems too sorta-hunky and young (I see the Phantom as someone around 50 years old) to be taken seriously.In fact, some of the film is difficult to be taken seriously. Schumacher almost seems intimidated by the complex balance of narratives and genre that The Phantom incorporates--the comedy/farce versus dark, dramatic moments seems campy. The flashbacks, forwards, whatever you want to call them, were interesting but I was more fascinated by the numerous production numbers. The blocking and the choreography is never awkward or clumsy. That's where the movie is so precise because it focuses much on the little details of the original story. Its also so well shot I could hardly keep my eyes from examining the lighting around the characters (two cases in point--the Masquerade and the swordfight in the cemetary were brilliant and what you might see on the stage). For its visual sense, I'll give it credit.The film is best to be described as a myriad of swirling pretty pictures and angelic music. Chills ran down my spine so many times I lost count, mostly because I love the songs. Superficially, its great escapist material, but if you look between the lines, and between the technical wonder of it all, there are some problems. All in all, if you look at it, the whole show's a beaut. I give it this verdict because I love the stage production so much that no film could ever rival it, but I'll give this Opera credit for trying."	3.0	Disappointing Phantom that doesn't live up to the hype	2004-12-30	4	0	4

It's a pretty good movie.BUT I wish it was a terrible movie!  I wish it is was reeeeeeeeealy rotted!  Why?I HATE IT!  Why?Because just enough is wrong with it to ruin it FOR WHAT IT IS.  WELL, WHAT IS IT?It is a Film version of one of the GREATEST MUSICAL PLAYS of this half of the CENTURY, THAT's what it is.  The PLAY is incredible.  IT'S ASTOUNDING.  A well-conceived, well-written, well-produced play is ALREADY 4 stars above a movie as an art form.  So when you make a movie OF A GREAT play.  You had better make it REALY WELL.  YOU HAD BETTER NOT MAKE ANY BIG MISTAKES.Guess what.  THEY DID.  TWO REEEEEALY BIG ONES.  other smaller ones, but I won't even mention them (the smaller mistakes wouldn't have ruined it for me).First BIG mistake:  THE 'APPEARANCE' OF THE PHANTOM.  Christine: ""Can I ever escape from that FACE so distorted, deformed, it was hardly a face . . .""  PHANTOM: ""A mask, my first unfeeling scrap of clothing""  Me: ""HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA AAAAAAAAAAAAAH HA HA HA!""  What?  HE's a BIG SEXY HUNK.  HE's not an ugly PHANTOM.  Gerard Butler was OBVIOUSLY CAST for his LOOKS!!  Which MAKES NO SENSE: TO CAST the HORRIBLY UGLY PHANTOM by his LOOKS!!  Did you NOT SEE THE PLAY.  That was a good make up JOB!  WHY did they stray so RECKLESSLY from the ORIGINAL CONCEPT???Well, HAD TO BE good Looking because of the NEXT BIG MISTAKE . . .Second BIG mistake: THE PHANTOM'S VOICEGERARD BUTLER NEVER COULD HAVE SUNG IN ANY STAGE PRODUCTION OF PHANTOM!!!  SO WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY!![side note: a NEW CD just CAME out it's called FABULOUS BROADWAY PHANTOMS.  It features 11 . . did you get that?  ELEVAN former phantoms who ALL sound better than GERARD.]WEBER and his DIRECTOR had NO reason, NO GOOD REASON for choosing BUTLER!!  He sounds terrible.  Theres only like 4 of 5 notes he actually holds, the rest he just kind of Growlingly talk/sings.  HE is the WORST part about the movie, however he IS THE MOVIE!!!THAT is why I can not like this film.  I admit their are some good parts in it.  Some cool scenes (""Wishing you were somehow here again"") where the MUSIC and the MOVIE become one and sour and it's wonderful, but Butler isn't in any of those scenes.  The whole concept was so twisted.  Here's this big HANSOME guy trying to impress this chick with his singing and he sounds pathetic.  I'm thinking at this point:  What movie is this?  Can't be the the PHANTOM.  The PHANTOM is a an ugly guy with an BEAUTIFUL, SEDUCTIVE, POWERFUL VOICE that makes YOU (not just Christine, YOU, the audience) like him, not because he HOT, because of his VOICE.  One MOVIE REVIEW I read said it well.  HE said: ""Christine should have gotten the Oscar for being able to look like she actually was impressed with the Phantom.""For what this movie is, it is an EMBARRASSMENT!"	3.0	For what this movie is,  IT'S EMBARRASSING!	2005-05-03	20	7	13

Phantom the movie is straight-out fabulous.While a movie by its very nature lacks the immediacy and energy of a stage production, it also allows for nuances that are impossible on stage. ""Phantom"" takes advantage of these possibilities. The backstage life of the Opera, the outdoor scenes, the ability to go into tight focus then pull back, are all part of the movie's strengths. If Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler lack the classic voices of the stage, they more than make up for it in looks. (Especially Gerard Butler. Mmmm.)

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3HPXZBDX7D5VM	Samantha Baer	overall, an OK movie. Emmy Rossum is great in the role of Christine, and That Other Guy is pretty good as Raoul (minus the goofy hair). visually, this film is as impressive as any, and the vocals are mostly solid.the only real problem here is Gerard Butler. cast as the Phantom, Butler has a powerful, intimidating presence and a sinister countenance. but his voice just doesn't cut it. his voice lack both the power and skill to sing the Phantom's roll. he seems incapable of performing vibrato, and his voice breaks into a a harsh scream in places where he is exerting himself while singing (like at the beginning of DOWN ONCE MORE). he also seems to lack the impressive range necessary to play thePhantom.so again, generally a good movie. i just hated Gerard Butler. and i'm usually a Gerard Butler fan. not here though. way to go, Joel Schumacher! couldn't you have at least given us the courtesy of finding a TALENTED Phantom?	3.0	it don't hold a candle to the broadway show	2010-06-13	3	2	1

I can't really say anything bad about the movie.  I'm not going to go into explicit detail here, the only ""bad"" thing I have to say is the fact that they dubbed in Carlotta's singing voice.  Now, I have no problem with the fact that Minnie Driver couldn't sing the part, but clearly was AMAZING at it acting wise.  I just disagree with them using another cast member's voice.  It would've been fine if Margaret Preece didn't have a solo in Il Muto right before Carlotta sings.  It was so obvious their voices were from the same person.  Other than that I loved this freakin' movie, and cannot WAIT until next Tuesday to buy it!"	5.0	One of the best movies I have ever seen	2005-04-24	6	3	3
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2KO7CJ10AXJ33	Samantha N.	Damnit. I can't stop listening to the soundtrack, and the songs off it are stuck in my head every single minute of the day.  There's not much I can say about the movie except that I enjoyed all 143 minutes of it.  If I go into too much detail, I'll end up talking about the music rather than the movie...which is what I'm writing a review for right now.  I thought the costumes were incredible (one part I found amusing was the man dressed up as Batman during the Masquerade scenes) and it's a pity they didn't get an Academy Award nomination for Costume Design.Acting-wise, I think the best performance was given by Gerard Butler. Which is weird, I know, considering he wears a mask for the majority of the movie. And because of that mask, it's harder for us to try to analyze his acting, so we have to resort to looking in his eyes to see if he can realistically play out the emotions that his character feels. Maybe it's just me, but I thought he did a pretty damn good job. As cheesy as it sounds, you can see the pain in his eyes when the Phantom feels pain; you can see the hope in his eyes when the Phantom feels hope; you can see the raw seduction in his eyes when the Phantom is trying to win Christine over. Not to mention, those movement lessons Butler took for the role did him some good, as well. There's a notable difference in the way he moves and acts when his face is covered by the mask and when his deformity is exposed. With the mask on, he's more confident and powerful. Without it, he's vulnerable, acts a little more insane, and strides around in humiliation. In the end, (and this isn't because of his good looks!) Butler made me sympathize for the Phantom, rather than making me see him as an ugly, maniacal murderer. Definitely an underrated actor, in my opinion. I won't go into his singing, as I've already written a review for the soundtrack and done it there. Moving on...Minnie Driver was brilliant as the diva. She was obviously there for comic relief and it was great! Her facial expressions and her accent make a hilarious combination. Patrick Wilson played Raoul well, no real negative criticism for him. As for Emmy Rossum...I do think they could've picked someone better to play Christine but she didn't do a horrible job. However, it wasn't superb, either. I wish she'd shown a little more expression when she was with the Phantom though, instead of that wide-eyed, open-mouthed look that was pasted on her face for 3/4 of the movie. In some scenes (ie: Think of Me) she just didn't have an expression at all. I guess singing and acting isn't something she can do at the same time? Miranda Richardson did well as Madame Giry, Jennifer Ellison played an adorable Meg, Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callows made their roles as the close-minded owners believable, blah blah blah.One other thing I absolutely loved about the movie is the use of transitions from one location/time period/scene to another. The Overture sends chills down my spine every time I hear it because I can still see the theatre going from dark and dusty to bright and stunning. It was amazing. Other transitions like the ones between the old Raoul and his memories of his younger days were really interesting as well. One I really liked is when the camera goes from Christine singing 'Think of Me' down to the lair where the Phantom is listening.Aaand of course, as with every movie ever filmed, there are those small mistakes made--like certain parts of costumes being moved around or props disappearing and reappearing again. There are also a few times when the lip-synching isn't done too well, but that doesn't really bother me much because it's not too noticeable unless you're watching their lips intently. I know there are some that think that during The Mirror/Phantom of the Opera, a mistake was made with Christine's makeup and hair when she goes from her room and travels to the Phantom's lair. Christine's makeup changes from minimal to dark and dramatic and her hair changes to wilder curls. This is not a mistake on the moviemakers' parts; her physical appearance changes because as she is heading to the lair, she is seeing how she WANTS to see herself (just like she's seeing the hallway with the gold arms holding the candles when really, it's dark, damp, and creepy) when she's with the Phantom and this is all in her imagination.Ooook, this is getting way too long. To wrap it up, if you can't already tell, I really liked this movie. There's a review down there where someone went into the theatre hating the musical already, and came out hating it even more--thus, complaining about every single thing in the movie.  If you hate it already, what are the chances that your opinion will change if you see the same storyline and hear the same songs in a movie version? Huh. Makes complete sense to me. Anyway. I can't believe I have to wait until May to be able to get the DVD. It's going to be a long three months.	5.0	I'm addicted...	2005-02-06	9	7	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3GFWWF4KA6DG5	SamDGresham	"Hollywood was once a hotbed of big, flashy, quality musical extravaganzas. Then it became a hotbed of action, horror, and comedy. Now, it is a land of cheap laughs, people up to their ears in sex, and the occasional musical adaptation of a hit Broadway show to pull in some extra cash from the theatre goers who would love to see their favorite shows on the big screen.We (the theatre goers) wouldn't mid this, if it weren't for the awful results which so often come from these adaptations. In 1996, ""Evita"" made it to the big screen, only to be a big letdown for fans of the show (do the movie producers even consider them?) In 2002, ""Chicago"" became a hit movie, even taking home the Oscar for Best Picture. After that, Hollywood began thinking that musicals were the thing to do, so they began spewing out movie adaptations of Broadway shows in the hopes that they would follow the same fate as ""Chicago,"" which I loved, by the way.When it was announced that Warner Brothers was to release a movie version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" I almost wet myself in excitement. I had only been a ""phan"" for about two months, and now I would finally get to see it! I began checking the official website every day, waiting for more news to be released. My world revolved around this movie's release for months. Finally, the movie was released. I could finally see what I had heard Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman singing on my worn out CD of the Original London Cast.Initially, I loved the movie. I thought the voices were a little off, but I loved the movie. I even saw it twice in theatres. Then the national touring production came to Atlanta, starring Beth Southard and Gary Mauer as Christine and the Phantom, respectively. A friend and myself went to see it on the closing night at the Fox Theatre. We had both seen the movie and were absolutely in love with the show. After seeing the live stage production, I can now say, without any shred of doubt that this movie was not made for the phans, but for a new generation of possible phans.The first thing they did wrong was cast the three leads the way they did. I won't compare Gerard Butler to Michael Crawford, because it would be like comparing a Happy Meal to a gourmet dinner, but I will compare him to any actor who has played the Phantom on stage (except Paul Stanley). He is awful. Bad. Horrid. There is nothing good about his performance. I hate him in this role. For one thing, he is clearly too young to be playing the Phantom! TOO YOUNG! The Phantom (I'll call him Erik to save typing time) should not be young, tanned, built, and good-looking. Erik should be older, pale, thin, and creepy. Did the casting directors even look at the Leroux novel for reference? As for his ""disfiguration,"" it is a joke. I've had pimples scarier than that crap. Erik does not have bad sunburn and a small bump on the side of his face; he has a practically melted face, no nose, and a hole in his head. THAT is creepy! I can honestly say that I have never had a pimple as scary as that. As for his voice, it is not a bad voice. It IS a HORRIBLE voice for this part. Erik should have a smooth, sensual voice, NOT a hard, growly, rocker voice. In short: Gerard Butler should not have been cast as the Phantom; there are plenty of other actors who could have done a much better job than him.Emmy Rossum, though very pretty and very good for the character of Christine, simply does not have the voice to support the role. Her voice could never have filled the opera house, and the managers would have been laughed at for trying to put her in Carlotta's role. Though her voice is pretty, it's too pretty for a character that is supposed to be an operatic soprano. I will say that her rendition of ""Point of No Return"" is very good, and I get chills every time I hear her growl ""consume us."" She has some redeeming qualities to her that make her Christine bearable, but nothing spectacular.I'm not going to bother writing about Patrick Wilson as Raoul, because he is such a wasted character in this movie. Note to screenwriters: a swordfight does not add anything to a character except some bruises. Instead, I will take a brief moment to mention that I applaud the supporting cast for being well cast, though I deduct points for not casting a Carlotta who could actually sing the part herself. If Margaret Preece could sing the role, why couldn't she simply play the role? She did it on stage; she might as well do it in screen.Now that I have ripped the movie to shreds, I'll review the wonderful DVD. The first disc contains the movie, and it has excellent sound and video quality. The French language track is also very good (and the singers are often better than their English speaking counterparts). The fun really starts on disc two. Here, viewers can view two documentaries (one about the show, the other about the film), a deleted scene, and a hidden video of the movie crew attempting to sing the title song from the show (yes, from the show, not the movie. This rendition does not chop out the fourth verse). The behind-the-scenes of the movie is just like any other:  nothing special here (unless you like to hear Webber's excuses for the horrid leading actors who were cast in the movie). The deleted scene, featuring the song ""No One Would Listen"" is also nothing special. Were the scene in the film, it would have brought it to a screeching halt and completely ruined the excitement of that particular sequence (it would have been between the plan to capture the Phantom and ""Point of No Return). The real treat is the documentary ""Behind the Mask,"" a look at how the stage musical came to be. It features interviews with many of the creatives behind the show, as well as beautiful footage from a (at that time) recent London performance of the show, making viewers wish even harder for a DVD of the actual show to be released. The crew sing-along is fun, but painful. Expect to cringe more than once while viewing.To wrap up what I've said, the movie is visually stunning, but the performances are nothing specal, and sometimes quite bad. The supporting cast is great, but I wish Carlotta had been played and sung by the same actress. The DVD set is wonderful, and the second disc offers some real treats for the fans and phans. The DVD gets 5/5 stars from me, but I have to knock off two points for screwing up the casting."	3.0	"""The Music of the Night""...it croaks like a toad!"	2006-12-26	11	9	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AGPBV8OSSLHQK	Sam Thorn	"The Phantom of The Opera is, on the stage, a musical that captures what I believe is the essence of theater. The story and music accentuate the deepest, most soulful human emotions, namely love, jealousy, hatred, fear, lust, and compassion, and wind them into a tragic Gothic love story.Phantom also has some comic moments, to ease the tenser moments of the show, or to prepare for some shock, such as the hanging of Bouquet (that's all I'll say on that matter, which is a real shock in the show, and an excellent thrill.) To sum it up, it is a great play.That said, the musical instigates great expectations for the film. For instance, on the stage the atmosphere is essential to the experience, and it becomes somewhat harder to do this well in a film. Phantom meets this challenge spectacularly, making use of surround sound and special effects to create a very convincing opera house. All in all, Phantom does the stage-to-screen transition well as far as sets and atmosphere.Phantom is also very faithful to the show. There are only two major changes in the entire movie: First and foremost, there are periodic scenes from the perspective of an older Raoul, shown in black and white. While there is a short appearance by this aged man in the opening of the play, the scenes from then on draw from the plot of the original novel combined with the subplots of the play. They are a nice addition in my opinion, as they nicely bridge the gaps that are remedied in the play by a short blackout. The other major difference is the fall of the chandelier in the second act instead of the first. This is, in my opinion, not as detrimental as some say, as the importance of this event is only important in that it happens; the when is not all that important.Finally, the voices are very well done. Many fans (or ""phans"", as they are called on many fan websites) have an undying devotion to the original voices of Sarah Brightman (Christine) and Michael Crawford (The Phantom). Personally, I view this as a so-called ""acquired taste"", as I feel that Sarah Brightman has a voice that is not suited for the role of Christine; a wavering, shrill sound that does not convey the purity associated with Christine. And, it makes her difficult to understand. Michael Crawford also has a poor voice for his part; a high tenor that can sometimes sound nasally. This does not suit the Phantom's part as it cannot convey the coflicting emotions that are the soul of the Phantom in the play and movie. I much prefer the voices of Emmy Rosum (Christine in the movie, a soprano with the pure, unwavering voice that I feel is essential for her part) and the bass of Gerard Butler (The Phantom in the movie, whose voice, again, better captures his role than does that of his thespian counterpart).Overall, this was an excellent movie and a great play, so I feel that it deserves the 5-star rating."	5.0	A Great Transition From Stage to Silver Screen	2005-12-01	8	8	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A32XW50ILWOXNO	Samuel McKewon	"There are moments where the screws fall in place and ""The Phantom of Opera"" soars, musically and dramatically.As a visual achievement it's a lush and bold statement from director Joel Schumacher, a cinematic painting of opera houses, dungeons and graveyards in reds and blacks and whites and greys. Schumacher's made too many films - and some not very good ones - but technically he's strong and professional and fluid. The man can direct mood.And then there's Emmy Rossum, just an 18-year-old kid, is so pure a singer and regal a beauty - well, they found the right girl for Christine. Two of the four key elements - the production and the female lead, are such aces that the accompanying factors - The Phantom and the music - could be, well, what they are.A drag.Some musicals are simply better than others, and some bridge better to movies, too and Andrew Lloyd Webber's words and music do not immediately spring to mind as easy translations. Not for ""Evita"" and not here. One could even argue ""The Phantom of Opera"" is a lackluster musical, period, and yet the response to it is so fierce, so absolute that whatever chord it strikes in its fans is significant.And yet even fans will be let down by the singing portions of the film. They sit uneasily between spoken word scenes. Only the masquerade ball has an opening flourish decently charting a descent into song. In recent years Baz Luhrmann, Lars Von Trier and Rob Marshall found their own ways of kick-starting the musical portion of their movies (""Moulin Rouge,"" ""Dancer In The Dark,"" ""Chicago"") into gear. Schumacher's only failure is to mishandle the mixture of song and spoken word. It's a little dumb when Rossum might sing a transitionary phrase, or even a singular word, and within the same scene speak whole lines of dialogue.A lackluster Phantom, played Gerard Butler, doesn't assist matters. Butler is a beefcake lacking tragedy. Or even weariness. Or age. Or somber emotion. Hulking, moping creep he might be. His voice is a pulling moan, defiled by Rossum's clarity and pitch. He comes at the role as a slow-moving linebacker would, adding rage to his tab until he bursts near the end. Neither he nor Patrick Wilson, as the Viscount Raoul, are particularly worthy of Rossum's Christine, in voice or sex appeal, and when they duel with swords near the end of the movie, there isn't much at stake.Aside from Minnie Driver, who cannonballs into the role of opera diva Carlotta with an at-times incomprehensible Italian accent, other performers, including Miranda Richardson, generally stand to the side in hushed, reverent poses, in awe of their mere presence in the film, until they're called to sing, when they inhabit Webber's jaunty, camera-mugging persona.Certainly there is an air of ""event"" in the production, and Schumacher surely aspires to it, but passion wanes and drama is muted. ""The Phantom of the Opera"" produces mostly an uneasy heat, with Rossum, brilliant as her voice is, sandwiched between a angry slug and Some Other Guy who pops up to profess an undying love he hasn't begun to show."	3.0	Rossum's a knockout.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1UU8BMH0XIUOV	Sandra Ward	I knew this movie was going to be good the minute I saw the first preview, but it far exceeded my expectations. Gerard Butler did an excellent job! He was sexy and intriguing and yet he could scare the wits out of you! And his singing! People who say that man can't sing must be tone deaf! I loved the fact that(like in the book) you felt for the phantom and despised Raoul for taking Christine's attentions from Erik. Even though the phantom could be so monstrous sometimes, you still loved him.When people said that they made the phantom too sexy, I really have to disagree. Sure, the description in the book is alot different then the portrayal in the movie, but you have to remember the phantom is suppose to pull you in completely like he did with Christine. Can you honestly say that he still would've done that if they had made him look like a skeletal figure with a missing nose and empty eye sockets that glowed red? You probably would've still felt for him, but you probably wouldn't have been enthralled by him.Anyway, I was completely and entirely happy with the movie. I don't think they could've done a better job. I can't wait to own the movie!	5.0	Excellent Movie!	2005-02-09	8	7	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3IRV5T46Y9ZAD	Sarah B. Chalk	"Phantom is my all time favorite musical. I have only seen it on stage twice (touring companies at the Orpheum Theatre/Memphis) and it is a breathtaking, heart rending story. I felt some of the very same butterflies-in-my-stomach excitement watching this film version as I did waiting for the curtain to rise on the stage version. I am as big a Michael Crawford fan as the next guy, but I am not going to go so far as to dismiss the talent of the film Phantom. Gerard Butler did a WONDERFUL job vocally, and I thought the sexiness of this phantom added a whole new dimension to the character. I know it sounds superficial, but this phantom was HOT and with talent to boot, was a huge bonus!Christine was lovely and innocent and possessed all of the qualities we would expect in Christine. Her voice was smooth and confidant and while it didn't send chills like Sarah Brightman, for her age and experience she did an incredible first rate job. I really like this girl and look forward to watching her career.One should try to approach the viewing of this film with no expectations or preconceived notions about how it should be. I was of course hoping it would mirror the stage play and while their were some discrepancies, the film was in no way a disappointment or let-down. I think the film was true to the play and it appears to me that the director loves the original piece and kept his version as honest as possible. My kids all loved it and ""got"" it. They sympathized with the phantom and saw his humanity beneath his facade of not the obvious ""mask"" or disfigurement, but the barriers he had so carefully set around himself. A GREAT film...Thrilled it is on dvd...Destined for great things....Truly a film library classic."	5.0	Wonderfully Seamless Transition From Stage to Screen.....	2005-05-10	6	3	3
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	ANA2PVMARGY8H	"Sarah ""Bookworm/cat person"""	"For those of us who have seen the stage production or listened obsessively to the Phantom soundtrack, this movie does not disappoint.  Yes, it has more than one campy moment (from Minnie Driver/Carlotta's over-the-top wig (very bad pun intended) and dress descending from the stage's ceiling to the serendipitous horse transporting the Phantom and Christine to the bowels of the Paris Opera Populaire--in real life, I don't think a horse could survive underground for very long without its hooves rotting), but even those moments have become endearing.  Though if truth be told, my friends and I laughed our heads off in the movie theatre during those two scenes.A darker and very painful part of the movie was the look into the Phantom's childhood.  I have to fast-forward this scene, or I'll start crying.  Miranda Richardson's character took pity upon the abused child, yet had no idea as a young girl that this deformed autodidact would grown up to haunt the opera house.  (In the special features disc, the director joked that Miranda Richardson interviewed him for the job, not the other way around, to see if this project was a worthwhile investment of her energy and talents.)The actor who played Raoul was brilliant as was newcomer, Emmy Rossum. People have insulted Gerard Butler's performance and compared it negatively against the standard of Michael Crawford's Phantom.  I think that Gerard's acting was very good, and I really empathized with his character's plight.  His singing was amazingly good for an amateur who had only just begun voice lessons after he won the coveted role. I challenge any critic to perform as well under those circumstances. (However, I will admit that I'm surprised that an amateur was cast for this role.)The scenery was lush, the costumes luxurious, and the music--yes, overplayed, but nonetheless--gorgeous; no expense was spared for this production. The director said that this movie as-to-date is the most expensive and lavishly produced Independent Film.  I really wish that movie producers would get the ball rolling and put Lucy Simon's ""The Secret Garden"" on the Silver Screen.  Rebecca Luker could retain her role as Lily in an on-screen production.  Just a suggestion for ""The Really Useful"" Film/Scion Films Production Company."	5.0	Five stars for this long-anticipated movie!!!	2006-08-22	8	7	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A37XWYQOON1BLS	"Sarah ""JaneiteSarah"""	"""The Phantom of the Opera"" is one of the few ""favorite musicals"" I haven't seen a production of, despite trying to for a number of years.  I listened to and memorized the music, and bought the original novel and the original cast recordings, and from reading the novel and the libretto, pictured in my mind what it must be like.  Musically, the score is excellent, and one that I love to sing, the plot is compelling, and I do hope to see it in the future.Having said that, I believe that this was an incredible adaptation.  It made the story line a tad more believeable, while still keeping the mystery of the original libretto.  The first time I saw it, it was a bit strange to hear a baritone singing the part of the Phantom, especially when I remind myself of Michael Crawford's original mastery of the role.  And I missed the testosterone that Steve Barton brought to the role of Raoul.  However, I loved their interpretation.  It added to the movie that the Phantom was rather young and held as much (if not more) sex appeal than Raoul.  It made his plight all the more terrible in the end.But the best part of the movie was the role of Christine, which Emmy Rossum sang with such innocence and grace, taking the role and reinterpreting it from Sarah Brightman's original creation into something new and fresh, yet keeping all the original emotion that made Christine's character work in the original.  As a vocalist, I loved listening to her sing the part. Her voice was clear without being technically strident, and held a pure innocence that truly embodies Christine in a way that Sarah Brightman's technical singing could never convey.  It made the music much more accessible.  I have sung Christine's lines over and over for years, and I still could not match the technical brilliance that Sarah Brightman shows in the original cast recording, but Emmy's performance, though less technical, was just as beautiful, giving the music a warm emotion and accessibility that the original did not have.And a quick word here about Carlotta, Minnie Driver totally captured this conceited diva! She did it with such flare, I found myself almost wishing I could hate Carlotta more than I did to begin with.  Some of the best laughs in the movie are Carlotta's.The scenery is very good, if at times a little hammy.  Still, it was thrilling to watch the stage and house change from black and white into color, as the chandelier rose.  I leaned over to my friend and said, ""This is definitely a buyer.""  The rest of the movie did not disappoint."	5.0	Excellent Adaptation!	2005-03-03	8	7	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3OZWCSLBBD6YZ	Sarah Winter	"I have never seen Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage production of Phantom of the Opera, but I have reread the book at least once a year since late elementary school. The Phantom is one of the best books ever written. Erik is one of the best characters ever created. When I saw Webber was producing a film version, I was very excited. Finally, a way to see the stage production without going to NYC :)The costumes and sets are sumptous. The tension between Christine, Raoul, and the Phantom is believable and has real depth. I loved the music, which of course is taken directly from the stage production.This film has the romance, the drama, the beauty, the music, everything I would have expected.As for performances, there are so many things I can say. Patrick Wilson shows not only acting but singing chops in a strong performance as Raoul, the Phantom's competitor for Christine's affections. His voice is as beautiful as his face, and he makes a believable suitor for Christine. Emmy Rossum was captivating as Christine. Her voice is gorgeous, and her youthful beauty only adds to the character's appeal. She sings like an angel and performs like a prima donna. Minor characters like Minnie Driver's Carlotta and Miranda Richardson's Madame Giry steal the spotlight in their scenes, and make the movie very enjoyable. Driver gives the film some much-needed humor as the terrible singer and Richardson injects some background information on Erik and her own association with him. She also advises the new owners of the Opera Populaire and Raoul later on, when the fit hits the shan and the opera house catches fire after a sabotage by the phantom himself.Now to the Phantom himself. Gerard Butler's performance (vocals and acting) have been dissected by many, but I will tell you why his is my favorite Phantom. Butler's performance is provocative and nuanced throughout the film. He begins as just the mentor, stealing peeks at Christine as she performs her aria, calling ""brava"" while she lights a candle afterward. When she returns to her room, he sings to her and shows himself for the first time. All you see is the mysterious mask over the right side of his face and you hear a deep, raspy (and yes, untrained) voice luring Christine through the mirror. When she joins him and you see them heading to his lair beneath the opera house, he turns his head and there's the rest of the face we've been waiting for. It's a beautiful face, too. I cannot tell a lie.Even from his first frames, Butler is mesmerizing. He's a more sexual Phantom than others. He's opening Christine's eyes and mind to her baser desires, trying to bind her to him that way, but he's also discovering his own seemingly for the first time. There's a vulnerability to Butler's Phantom that makes him almost childlike. You feel the hope the Phantom feels. He's a grown man with all the implied desires and needs, but inside he's just a hopeful little boy who wants to be loved and accepted. Butler has a raw sexual charisma that carries the character through his attempts to seduce Christine through music. When he sings ""Music of the Night"" in his lair, he is very much in control and yet still completely vulnerable. If she chooses to leave, you know he will be devastated. Rossum's and Butler's voices together in ""Don Juan Triumphant"" create a sexual tension that's palpable. And again, there's the bald-faced hope of a child trying to be loved. While he holds Christine captive and threatens Raoul's life, his desperation and longing come to a head and you see a man in love. A man who needs to know he is loved in return. When Christine kisses him you see a man being kissed possibly for the first time in his life. You watch his heart break. He sits and cries afterward watching his music box play and I cry right along with him. Butler delivers an emotional and utterly devastating performance. Period.Now for the part of the film I find people are most critical about. I felt Butler's voice in my heart. The Phantom is an exposed nerve left raw by neglect and abuse, and Butler's voice captured his hurt and his hope. This was a man wearing his heart on his sleeve and the emotion of that bled through into his voice. He may not be radio-ready but dammit, I loved his performance. Gerard Butler is my favorite Phantom and will remain so."	4.0	Lovely	2012-10-17	0	0	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3VNIIZ5NJDZ7E	Sarina	"Alright, the movie was FANTASTIC! I have to admit, when I first heard the soundtrack (before watching the movie), I was a bit doubtful over the quality of the singing because I am a DEVOTED Crawford/Brightman fan. But I figured I'd watch the movie, and I was NOT dissappointed! The singing by Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum fit in perfectly with the movie and I loved it! However, I do have a few ""bones"" to pick...Emmy Rossum does a fabulous job with the singing part. However, her acting was not quite there as I felt she was expressionless for a lot of the film. During ""Think of Me"", her facial expressions never really departed from a vacant look. At some points she had the correct emotions for the song, but for the most part, she seemed distant.Patrick Wilson-I think I had a reversed reaction; I never really disliked Raoul until the movie. Now, not saying that Wilson did a bad job, he was ok. His voice however annoyed me for some really odd reason, I felt like his voice was just not suited for the role. It didn't seem ""calming"" or ""soothing"" enough for me. I love Steve Barton's (the original Raoul) voice and I guess I'm being a little bit biased. And same with Emmy, Wilson just doesn't seem to portray emotions very well either.Minnie Driver was absolutely HILARIOUS as Carlotta! Some might find her a nuisance, but I thought she was PERFECT and that her ""overly dramatic"" performance was just what was needed for Carlotta.Now for the Phantom-Gerard Butler. He was absolutely phenomanal as the Phantom. At some points he even surpassed Crawford's singing (I loved him in Point of No Return) He was the BEST actor out of all of them, and he was the PERFECT Phantom. Even though the high A in Music of the Night did give him a bit of trouble...but no matter, he was magnificent as the Phantom. And it didn't hurt that he was incredibly sexy. =)I am anxiously waiting for the UK DVD version...because of all the extra features....I am also going to lock myself up in a room with that DVD...for at least a week.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2OCNEE5JHLJI9	S&B	I just returned from the first matinee showing in Seattle.  It was AWESOME.  It was a packed theater and at the end EVERYONE clapped loudly.  Having read some of the previous reviews I was a bit apprehensive but I have a feeling they did not see the film, let alone the stage version.  I have seen Phantom 10+ times in cities all over the world(Seattle, Vancouver, Chicago, Toronto, New York, London, Sydney, blah, blah, blah).  Every show was a totally different cast.  Some were better than others, but the basics were all there.The movie goes into much more detail the the stage version ever could.  I loved the Phantom's background and the speaking parts that were added - much more depth and understanding of the complete story.  I did not get bored once, hence I never thought it was too long.  It is beautiful and lush and the singing great.  I have never been a fan of Michael Crawford myself so I thought this Phantom was as good, or better, than any stage verion I've seen.The previous comments about the B&W; portions looking old - HELLO, it's supposed to!!!  It's how they differentiate between 1919 (B&W;) and 1870 (color).  Also the comment about the Phantom's face transforming using CGI when his mask removed is bunk - it didn't happen.  It simply shows his disfigurement.I was one of the first 8 people in the theater and the group that sat next to me immediatly started talking about how they hoped they didn't sing throughout the movie - all I could think of was 'why are they here'?  I believe the negative comments are by people who don't like musicals and have most likely never seen a professional stage prodoction - I literally seen hundreds worldwide.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF	"S. Bradford ""scottfbradford"""	Fans of the musical will love this movie because it follows it quite closely.  The casting is nearly perfect:  Emily Rossum is gorgeous as Christine, Patrick Wilson makes a fine Raoul, and Minnie Driver is great as Carlotta.  I think they could have picked a better Phantom, but Gerald Butler pulls it off.  The HD DVD transfer is beautiful and the sound magnificent.  Emily really can sing like an Angel.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A5SO66DKQ5E7A	S. Capodice	This movie wasnt a total failure, but was by no means a success.  Whether the phantom was a little better looking than he should of been is not my gripe.  My gripe is that he was supposed to have the most amazing voice ever.  He's the key person that is supposed to out sing every one in the story.  But he's the one that sucks.  I mean, I know I can sing so I dont open my mouth.  Why oh why did they cast this guy.  I read a review about there being 11 other people that have played the phantom.  Hell, why didnt they just take those voices or something.  I mean, he REALLY doesnt do the role justice.  I would of been happier if even Raoul sang the phantom.The movie still did give you some of the feeling you get at the theater in that when that chandelear goes up, you are all psyched!  :)	2.0	Had excellent potential	2005-05-09	12	3	9

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1SH2M0LXT323	scientific mom	"I am a huge broadway musical fan, and I've seen POTO on stage, but I have not read the book.  There were some differences in the movie from the stage show...for one, more storyline (from the novel, I'm assuming) was added, making the plot a little deeper than the stage show.  These were a surprise to me since I've not read the book.The filmography was pretty good, but not the best I've seen.  The acting was awesome!  The biggest drawback that still sticks with me 24 hours after viewing is that the Phantom's voice was not up to par with the other two leads.  It's possible he's not supposed to have a good singing voice (maybe something mentioned in the novel that I don't know about?) but I doubt that's the case since the stage performance always includes a top-notch voice.I was also sorely disappointed in the masquerade scene; the soundtrack was so loud you couldn't hear the voices enough to understand the words, and I even know what the words are supposed to be.  Also, the choreograpy was off.  I'm not sure if this is because they were working with actors rather than musicians/dancers or what.  It wasn't just that the music overlay was out of sync (a big problem throughout) but the actors were out of sync with each other.To be honest, it reminded me of a good high school or college production with a couple of acceptional lead singers (the Phantom not included, although he was an awesome actor).  The best thing in the whole show was the ""scenery"".  I was much more impressed with Evita when it came out in film."	3.0	Worth seeing, I guess	2005-01-23	6	3	3
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AR1T36GLLAFFX	Scott FS	I've seen the stage version twice (traveling company) and the movie twice.  I preferred the film version, for the following reasons:The movie explained the 'back story'.  You see where the Phantom came from, why he grew from a tortured young boy into what he became.The set design was fantastic!  It helped open up the story by having a view of the building, the staircase, the upper reaches of the theater.  It's sort of unfair not being limited by a stage, but the director used the full ability of the big screen to offer a wonderful view of the insular world of the Paris opera.The casting was good, better than the traveling company, IMO.  Emmy Rossum WAS young, but fit the story and of course she is a talent for the future.  Gerard Butler was superb as the Phantom, Patrick Wilson OK as the wimpy Raoul.Switching back and forth from 'modern' era and earlier was very effective; tied the story together better.The singing was excellent, and the set design/art direction much better than that!  The movie did win three Academy Award nominations, after all, which is impressive as most films don't get an Oscar nod.I've pre-ordered this film and eagerly await its arrival.  I'm thinking about FINALLY getting that big screen HDTV so I can enjoy more of a movie house feel to it (I already have the home theater setup).  I've also ordered (and received) the soundtrack.This is my favorite movie of 2004.  Highly recommended!	5.0	Stupendous!	2005-03-01	13	12	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2I7ZAB04Q0DML	Scott Kolecki	"Since its London premier in 1986, Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"" has dazzled audiences with some of the most powerful stage performances ever seen.  Combining an epic soundtrack full of rich, lavish music with some of the most technologically advanced special effects of its time, Phantom has delivered an unforgettable performance for almost 2 decades!So why risk bringing such an incredibly successful live show to the silver screen, when Hollywood musicals have never done especially well?  The answer, in this case, is simple.  The Phantom is a musical about the power and passion of music.  Where so many musicals are a telling of a story set to song, Phantom instead uses the songs to advance a narrative story about a deformed genius who teaches an exceptionally gifted chorus girl to sing.  The music works becuase, as with most musical, it does advance the storyline, it also serves as underscoring to set tension, mood, romance and horror throughout the story, working more like a very effective movie soundtrack than musical score.  Combine this element with a story that contains all the goodies that make Hollywood blockbusters great: romance, horror, action, suspense and of course, epic storytelling, and you have a package that can't help but be successful on the big screen.Many fans of the musical are troubled by the casting of the lead parts.  Gerard Butler, a veteran screen actor, will done the mask and vocal parts of the Phantom, whose character was originally developed for Broadway superstar Michael Crawford.  Relative newcomer, Emmy Rossum will take on the demanding role of Christine Daae', a part that Lloyd Webber wrote specifically for (now ex) wife Sarah Brightman.  The use of this newcomer in this film is a calculated risk, but as the part of Christine is that of a woman who is relatively unknown, her involvement in the project might add a degree of believability to her character.The supporting cast is surprising as well.  Many of Hollywood's respected names are on board for this film in parts that are, at least in the stage version of this film, far smaller than the roles of Christine and the Phantom.  Miranda Richardson will play Madam Giry, and Minnie Driver will play the part of Opera Diva, Carlotta.The strength of this cast will be based on its ability to perform many of the productions demanding numbers.  Speculation has been circling that Andrew Lloyd Webber had been working on a sequel to his successful film, but it is now believed that the film version of Phantom will, in fact, contain the numbers that he has previewed at select concert venues in the past couple years.Directing this film is Joel Schumacher, whose name is synonymous with some of Hollywood's most successful films (St Elmo's Fire, Flatliners, 8mm, Phone Booth to name only a few).  His ability to create atmosphere and tension is second to none, and he should provide a vision to this film that will give it a vitality that will equal the spectacular stage direction origianlly given by Hal Prince.This film is scheduled to premire on December 25, 2004 nationwide."	5.0	Webber's Phantom Comes To the Silver Screen	2004-05-06	75	51	24

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3TC3D1UCAAI9H	S-Dav10495	"This is probably not a movie for the extremely cynical.  So it's no wonder why many critics, especially having already established a dislike for Lloyd Webber and Schumacher, did not give this masterpiece the credit it truly deserved.  One of the most beautiful films I have ever laid eyes on, ""Phantom"" is not meant to be analyzed--it is meant to carry you off your feet in one sweeping blow.  It is meant to be viewed by an audience prepared to let themselves enter another world more lush, more strange, and more unbelievable than their own--and it seems most audiences embraced the experience.  Like the sets and costumes, for which this film was at once praised and frowned upon, the melodic score surrounds every inch of you and settles itself in your head for at least a good week afterward.Moreover, there is a heart at the center of all the gold leaf and curtains--in short, Schumacher has stuck with the formula that made the show a mega-success over the past two decades.  Like the show, not every detail of the film is perfect, but the overall experience can be described as nothing short of breathtaking.  Don't look for trendy, frentic camera work here: the film knows its larger-than-life source material, and so is done in a big, bold, Old Hollywood fashion--and the result is a very successful adapation of the world's most successful show to date.  There is no doubt that Lloyd Webber's ""Phantom"" is a people-pleaser.I saw this movie with very picky moviegoers...one had a great big smile on his face as he walked out and the other, although laughing during the film at some parts that seemed overly fantastic, had to admit it was wonderful and now wants the soundtrack.  As for myself--even being a big fan and once ""purist"" of the stage show for many years did not stop me from loving this movie (as you can see).This film must be seen, if only for the visual wonder of it all...but most will come away with much more."	5.0	Start a journey through a strange new world	2005-02-17	29	29	0

At that time, no one could have compared to Michael Crawford, but now that I have seen the movie, I only listen to that soundtrack.  Yes, Gerard Butler is not formally trained, but, WOW, his raspy rocky voice comes off so much sexier and manlier it's pathetic.  When he's mad or singing with a booming voice, I hold my breath.  I, unlike the masses, never got into Sarah Brightman, her voice was too operatic for a rock opera.  Yes, I also saw the few mistakes, but they were easy to forgive when one looks at the picture as a whole.  It stirred many emotions especially when the music fit the scene perfectly.  My cheers to all involved.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Also, I thought it was a sham that the costumes and makeup were overlooked at Oscar time.  I will be buying this DVD on May 3rd!	5.0	The New & Hotter Phantom	2005-03-14	14	14	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A25QZSO3L37LN6	SE	Can't say enough about this movie.  The music actually brought me to appreciate more opera.  Andrew Lloyd Weber is brilliant but this particular music gets under your skin.  Gerard Butler's depth of the character of the phantom is definitely his best acting.  His singing is tortured and soulful and prevokes emotion as it should for his character..  Emmy Lou Rossum's voice is astounding.  She has done Sarah Brightman (the original Christine on stage) proud.  The acting and singing from everyone in this movie top notch. I used to watch this over and over when I first learned of the movie (unfoturnately not in 2004 when it was released!) and my beloved cat (who is gone now) became my little opera kitty as I called him as he would relax with me and seemed to appreciate the music.  A friend's son kept singing the Angel of Music words repeatedly, and another friend's niece absolutely loves the movie too.  So, not just for adults!

I absolutely loved the book's storyline and horrific mood, and expected something like that in the movie as well. But, to be honest, I was disappointed. Too much romance and too little horror! The story got a little confusing as Christine got abducted and somehow re-appeared with zero explanations. Also, I expected to see much more difficulties in Raoul's way as he goes after Erik to save Christine. In the movie, he pretty much just walks right into the realm of the Phantom of the Opera. Frankly, the Phantom does not have enough power to make the film interesting and understandable(excuse my lack of better words).As for the ""humanized"" Phantom, I felt sorry for him in the book even after all his evil deeds. I personally don't think the film producers had to make him all THAT pitiable.Well... I guess these things happen when people try to materialize at least half-fantastical novels.One thing I loved from the movie: music! I mean, it's impossible for books to have these beautiful music and songs, so the songs got stuck in my head right away.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AC9OL6FFXO6AN	S. Flory	"Any one that claims this movie is anything but magical is a fool! Butler does a wonderful job as the Phantom. He is mysterious and sexy, and you just can't help but feel pity for him. His love for Christine is so strong, and he desires her so greatly yet never forces himself on her, which he easily could (from what I saw I don't think she would mind, but what women in her right mind would.). You feel much more connected with the Phantom even if the story the told of his childhood is ridicules. The fact that he is younger then the original singer I feel was a much better choice the older singer in the play seems to much like a pedophile, with is unnatural desires for such a young girl.Christine is delightfully portrayed by the beautiful Emmy Rossum, her voice and her looks make it easy for you to see why she so easily captured the heart's of two gorges men. I do feel sorry for her in the movie though because you see the childhood love she holds for Raoul, and her desires for the Phantom, but you sense that she is still too young, and doesn't know how to quit respond to the VERY mature desires of the Phantom.The scene when Christine and the Phantom are singing, ""The Point Of No Return"", on stage at the end is so magnificently done. The passion between the two is amazing and you wonder how they have kept their hands to themselves for so long, well Raoul cries silently because he knows he has never evoke that kind of passion from his love Christine.. Then when the Phantom sings his part of ""That's All I Ask of You"" I cried you just can't help but feel the love he holds for Christine yet you know they will never have the chance to share that love or the passion.The one thing I really didn't care for during the movie was the horrible excuse of a sword fight between Raoul and the Phantom. That was the worst sword fight I have ever witnessed. I also find it hard to believe that the Phantom would ever let Raoul win.But over all I loved the movie I have seen it three times and I plan to see it again. I just wish that some haw the story could have change and Christine could have ended up with the Phantom like she rightly should. But alas I didn't write the story or the play so I can only dream."	5.0	Must See!	2005-03-06	6	5	1

Geeck ""wizardoz30"""	"Alright, I admit, I was a bit perturbed when they announced they were making the breathtaking stage show into a movie.  But I went with my friends, begrudgingly I might add, and I enjoyed almost all of it.Emmy Rossum- She seems lovely, but her movie performance seemed to be lacking in my opinion.  She does a good job of seeming almost torn between Erik and Raoul but at the same time she comes off as caring very little for either.  I don't think that is what she was trying to convey, but it is how she came across.  Her voice is decent, but as others have mentioned, I expected a stronger voice from ""Christine"".Gerard Butler- Again, some say his voice is subpar as the Phantom but I think he made the Phantom more real to many people.  His emotion came through and so the singing was not always flawless.  In ""Down Once More"" his rage and madness come through in the singing, but some think it makes his singing ""bad"", nope, just makes his portrayal more gripping.  The make up needed work for his ""disfiguration"".  In the scenes with the mask we see this beautiful head of hair and a perfect hairline, yet the mask comes off and suddenly the hair is longer, a different color and the hair line is non-existant because of the disfiguration?  That is a bit of an ""ooops"" in the technical department if you ask me.Patrick Wilson-  The first time around (yes, went twice!) I wasn't sure what to make of him.  His voice was lovely both times, but I was unsure whether it was his acting or Emmy's that seemed to be throwing the plot off center.  The second time I found him delightful and I actually like Raoul a LOT more after the film.  This role should make people forget about ""The Alamo"" ;)The rest of the cast is splendid.  No complaints, they are funny when they need to be and they rivet the attention when need be.  Miranda is a most splendid Madame Giry and Minnie's Carlotta is funny and dramatic, just as it should be.  The sets are stunning and the best part of the whole film may very well be the first 5 minutes when the curtain comes off the chandelier and the Phantom theme swells.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1PIRNQ1I06XTV	Sherrie Jackson	"I'll review the movie in a moment. What I want to share first is how pleasantly surprised I am at the extras included. Sure, they could have given us more--four different kinds of trailers, costume design boards, a scene from every Phantom movie thus far, interviews with Crawford and Brightman, not to mention commentaries. But hey, isn't that what Christmas is for? :)However, I was enthralled by the story of how the musical came to be. We get not only plenty of airtime from Lord Webber and Stilgoe & Hart, but we see the original stars in footage that we would never be able to see otherwise. Sara Brightman singing ""Pie Jesu"" in what looks to be a cathedral, Michael Crawford doing light comedy--light comedy!--on a British show and performing in the circus. We're taken into Webber's estate to view the singers who first performed the Phantom material as it was being constructed, and are enlightened as to how Britain charmingly previewed the musical, via music video, to the rest of the nation as what looked to be, quite literally, a rock opera. (Well, it WAS the 80s.)The other extras that focus on the movie production are also quite good. I thought it might be only a slightly longer version of one of those HBO First Looks, but it was super-informative. In it you get a look at the premier, at part of Emmy Rossum's screen test, the fun of trying to understand Jennifer Ellison's (Meg) accent, Patrick Wilson singing opera in sport pants, the Mask of the Red Death swigging from a water bottle, plus a look at the outrageously elaborate costumes and what the chandelier falling looked like in real life. There's so much more I can't remember, but trust me, it's worth it.I'm not sure sure about the additional scene. I'm glad they didn't keep it in. While it's a lovely song, the Phantom was too soft, not at all obsessive or dangerous. And we don't want that, now, do we?And, about that movie. Emmy Rossum has a perfectly capable voice even at her age, just as Christine is supposed to be quite young. But her face had the same expression on it--trancelike--almost the entire time. When she saw Raoul caught in the Punjab lasso and cried out, I was like, Finally! And then she went back into the trance. I wish they had coaxed more expression out of her.Gerard Butler. Either you love him or you hate him. We all know he's hot. I was really surprised at first sight of the Phantom, because from the stage shows you get the impression that even with the mask on, he's a crowish figure of no less than forty years. I enjoy watching Butler, but if they had used someone less attractive I don't think it would have taken anything away from the movie. As for his voice--I whispered to my mom at one point that he sounds like a rock star. And yes, Butler was indeed in a rock band. He's no Michael Crawford. And sometimes his treatment of phrases isn't the best. But on the flip side, sometimes it's just as uncomfortable listening to a stage Phantom sing in full-on operatic mode. It's...whatever you like, I guess.Of course, the sets are lavish and the costumes lush (and vice versa). I love Minnie Driver in the Carlotta role, and the men who played the managers were really a delight. I know people gripe about all these different things--the addition of scenes, speaking dialogue that was previously sung, the misplacement of the chandelier's big scene, a colorful masquerade being clothed in black and white. But in the end I still think the movie is more than worth it. Why?Because you can see it whenever you want to now. Because the full orchestra sounds heaven-sent. Because knowing all the words to a musical is a big deal. Because it's beautiful. Because it's a full-on experience that requires nothing less than your full attention. Because snow and confetti falling never looked so perfect. Because my first exposure to the musical was on a cassette tape with half the second act missing and it was still so potent that I stayed up to listen to it again. Because the Phantom's hot (oops).So, that's what I think. If you truly love the musical, you'll like the movie. If you knew nothing of the musical before, then you'll probably like it, too."	4.0	Aww, give it a chance	2005-05-06	3	2	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3QTRWZUGX24K9	"Sherri Jones ""spidey789"""	I read many reviews & watched both discs several times critically & with an open heart before writing my review. I read Emmy's & Gerry's interviews on the web and I even went so far to view Gerry's astrology chart, hey it was there on the web to see and the man turns me on in so many levels, so what the heck. Let's not mince words, Gerry's voice warbles in parts, absolutely soars in others. Emmy's voice wasn't consistent either, so vocal experience has nothing to do with it. The rock quality is there in this Phantom, no question, and I love that about this movie. I relate to this story on many levels though I have tried so hard not to give in... heh heh. I have been learning Phantom myself as part of my own vocal training, so I understand how it goes. You have to have ear, emotion, practice, some technical skill, some understanding of anatomy and what to do with it, you have to warm up, you also have to have heart, and quality. Like Gerry, my career changed direction. I'm glad this movie came out when it did. It was hard for me to feel the music I was supposed to be learning without ever having seen the theatrical version. Gerry made Phantom history; his performance IS a milestone in the art and interpretation of this awesome story of passion, loss, and life. Adding a rock sound to the Phantom's voice is not a crime. Rock is about breaking barriers and I love the way this movie invites young people learning voice training onto this edge, this wonderful spear between classical sound, richness to the ear, and rock opera. It's beautiful, sumptious, romantic, painful, releasing, rich, edgy, genius, I love it, and I know there are young composers out there who will see this movie, get inspired, and start on a highway in life that will create even new milestones in music history. And Gerry's astrology chart? One look at his chart and I knew why he made such a great phantom. I left this movie finally getting it, just getting it. Though phantom has felt such pain and loss, he lived like a zoo animal as a child for pete's sake, he is greatful to have had this mirror of her innocence held up to him, just the first lovely person he's ever come across in the highway of life. I love the new song Webber added for the film; it drives the story home, and I can't wait to learn it.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A17ST6S1ECW54Y	Sherry Laflamme	Okay, some of you may have your negative comments about the singing and compare it to the original stage actors/singers for Andrew Lloyd Webber. That's great that you got to see the Broadway version. I did not get that opportunity. This story has always been one of my favorites dating way back to the 1962 version with Herbert Lom. That was typically creepy and the viewer wanted the phantom to die in the end. I love this musical version with so much love and compassion for the phantom. Gerard Butler swayed me to see him as a sad and lonely Phantom. Emmy Rossum's Christine was lovely. For the most part the singing these two did was great. Who knew GB could even attempt a singing role, and his acting made up for any lack of vocal quality. I love it when actors go outside of their normal comfort zone and succeed in something new. Personally, I loved the whole movie. I love the story. It will always be one of my favorites.	5.0	My Fave	2014-04-14	0	0	0

No offense, I love Sarah Brightman's voice but have you even heard Emmy Rossum's voice it is spectacular. As is Gerard Butler!!Michael Crawford is also awesome but is also 20 yrs older.  I think the new cast will be a good one if not better. I also am a big fan of Phantom and a little sketchy of putting it on screen but I have seen the Trailers both teaser and regular and it looks awesome. So i am stoked and can't wait to see it!!!  I live in a small town so it will never come here so i travel an hr - 2 hrs to see movies that don't come to our local mall. I did for Chicago and will again for Phantom of the Opera, which i think should be faithful to the stage play, that is if Andrew Lloyd Webber didn't let them cut it up like so many movie musicals have done before.  I think if someone is going to turn a Musical into a movie they should be faithful to the script and not change a single thing.  My high school did the production of ""On the Town"" which is a wonderful show and when i went to rent the movie i had found out the movie was WAY differnt then the play.!. i hate when the movie is nothing like the play itself.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2VRNYXRLSWQSX	Sigrid Simms	"Let's start with Gerard Butler who is gorgeous, mesmerizing, sensual, tantilizing, any thinking-woman's fantasy lover - and he can sing, too. Okay, take a deep breath. Never having seen him before, he was a revelation. The way he uses his voice and body language is a subtle seduction that stays with you long after the movie is over. And he makes the unmasked Phantom as sexy as the mysterious masked & caped Angel of Music. His raw intensity and tragic longing is sensational. (My husband says he's buying a cape - like that's all it would take? Oh, sweetheart.)Emmy Rossum as Christine has a lovely voice but lacks any true sensual appeal - sorry girl, but I don't know what he sees in you and how can you resist that bed! Patrick Wilson as the Viscount can also sing and act but, of course, he's no Phantom. Maybe they deserve each other - too bad they get to share one of the best love songs every written with ""All I Ask of You."" The worst part of the movie is the role of Carlotta which is horribly overdone.She's soooo annoying and her scenes are much too long. Use those minutes to go get a snack.The directing is weak, there are just too many scenes with the opera singers and ballet dancers when all anyone really cares about is the romantic triangle. What was the director thinking in cutting constantly to flamingo dancers during the deeply sensual 'Point of No Return' number.(That will raise your temperature a degree of two.)Everyone knows the story so, suffice to say that the movie is very lush, with beautiful sets and costumes. The music, of course, is just wonderful.Have a girl's night in with your best friends and a couple of bottles of wine and let Gerard Butler ""sing songs in your head"".

To my amazement and joy it was a spectacular display of what can be done on film and not just on stage!  People and critics have complained that it doesn't match the stage play, and can't compare...well to that I say, you can't compare the two.  Two different mediums, two different techniques.  The actors they chose did very well in their parts and performed past my expectations.I would like to answer a previous reviewer...""Also, can anyone explain why his hair is dark, glossy black until his mask comes off, at which point it changes to mousy brown? Where was the continuity person?"" They didn't need a continuity person because if you had been paying attention to the movie, he's wearing a wig.  They show that when he puts on the mask.Emmy Rossum does an excellent job of being a young impressionable girl.  It is not too difficult to believe she is captivated by what she believes is an angel.  Patrick Wilson is great portraying Raoul, a nobleman of the time, kind of arrogant, and believes the world should follow his lead.  Gerard Butler as the phantom makes him human, and almost likeable, something that the stage play really didn't do, but then with the closeness of the camera that can happen.The set designs were fantastic and reflect what the Paris Opera House really looks like.

Kohler ""alora_11"""	I was NOT a fan of Moulin Rouge for the simple reason it was a musical and the main characters couldn't sing and the supporting cast... well, if you saw it you know.The Phantom at least has one great singer Patrick Wilson, one good singer Emmy Rossum, and one ok singer Gerard Butler.  Plus the supporting cast was good.  I like it visually but when I heard a song by Butler I prayed it was a song for a tenor and not a baritone.  Every time Butler tried to sing in the lower ranges either he was out of tune or he was talk/singing forcefully (and neither sounded good).But over all in the end I enjoyed the movie, I just wish they would have casted the parts of the Phantom and Christine a little better.  I am not blaming the actors but the casting director for either not picking the right person or for not letting the people they picked have more vocal training.But I am a sucker for this romantic musical so I will be buying it on Tuesday.	4.0	Think Moulin Rouge....  but much better.	2005-04-22	6	0	6
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3ELSU1SHRX09Y	skunktrain	"I admit, I'll never be a major Phantom ""fangirl."" However, I can understand the appeal of this deeply melodramatic, gothic musical. I'd seen the musical on stage years ago, and while I thought it was very good, it did not inspire a life-long fandom in me. However, the film offers something a stage production cannot--a more close, intimate, and lush experience. So it's no surprise that the movie adaptation had a greater impact on me than the stage musical.I came into this movie with an open mind about casting and other details. I didn't have a firm, rigid idea of who would (or would not) be good as the Phantom. I'd never seen Michael Crawford play the part, only the younger, more attractive Davis Gaines. So, I had no trouble with Gerard Butler as the Phantom. His voice is not perfect, but he sings with great emotion and gusto. It seemed to me that he made the most of his limited vocal skills, and so I found his singing surprisingly good--in a raw, uneven sort of way. Butler is also strikingly handsome in this film, which is funny, because in the few other films I've seen him in, he was more average-looking. I think he's one of these ""chameleon"" type guys who can look drastically different in various roles. He sure makes a fabulous impression as the Phantom.Emmy Rossum is lovely, has an absolutely stunning (STUNNING) voice, and seems to possess the right amount of sweetness and innocence for the role of Christine. Patrick Wilson also has a gorgeous voice, (but I *hated* his hair). He does the best he can as the almost universally disliked Raoul. (Well, we don't *dislike* him, we just don't *like* him all that much. He's not nearly as interesting as the Phantom!) Minnie Driver is also great as a prima donna pain-in-the-neck diva. She always has outlandish constumes and is very funny.I enjoyed the music--the melodies are appealing and stick in your head, but after a while I started to think, ""Didn't I hear this tune before?"" Lots of recycling of material. It's not all *that* bad, and I liked the music enough to buy a few songs online, but when I compare it to some other famous musicals of the past, it does not measure up.The thing I most enjoyed about this movie are the visual elements--the photography, the costumes, the sets, (oh my, the elaborate sets!). The attention to detail was fantastic. A feast for the eyes. And yeah, the actors and actresses are all a feast for the eyes too--everyone's very attractive.The story is . . . let's not mince words . . . a trifle *thin*. I wished there was more character development, and I wish there was more backstory, more fleshing out of the Phantom's and Christine's prior (and very strange) mentor/protegee relationship. It's still an interesting tale, especially near the ending, when things really start to pick up.My advice to anyone who has never seen any variation of ""Phantom"" is to realize that it is *WAY* over-the-top with melodrama--is angst-ridden, gothic, terribly romantic.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3KKM0T1KY42HA	Sky	Masquerade! Every face a different shade,Masquerade! Look around - there's another mask behind you!Those two lines from one of my favorite songs in my favorite Broadway musical analogize perfectly the amount of different leads that I've seen in the role of the Phantom.When you've seen the best in a role it is hard to appreciate the next guy as much. Michael Crawford was by far the superior Phantom. He acted the part well, with emotion and an unparalleled vocal performance. Howard McGillin (who can still be seen on Broadway) is also excellent. So Gerard Butler had some very very big shoes to fill...and he filled them well.But Butler's voice was not as powerful (or it did not come through as so in the film version) as Crawford's or even McGillen's. To try to put it in perspective, would you go to see Pavarotti if you knew his understudy would be doing the performance? Seeing Butler in the role will be just fine for anyone who's not experienced Crawford or McGillin, but for me it came across as a very good understudy performance. This is the reason the film gets 4 instead of 5 stars; I am of the opinion that the film producers settled when there was a better leading man option somewhere out there.On the other hand, Emmy Rossum shocked me in the film. She was as amazing as the first time that I heard and saw the part of Christine played live by Sarah Brightman.Ultimately, I enjoyed the film immensely. After seeing the Broadway show more than a half-dozen times, I was quite skeptical that the film version would/could do the production justice. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie version looked great and the sound was absolutely terrific.But like any musical performance on DVD, if you've ever seen the live show you can't come close to comparing the audio experience unless you have a surround sound system and the DVD is offered (like Phantom is) in DTS or Dolby 5.1.  It really makes a giant difference if you have to experience a musical performance in the far inferior standard 2.0 stereo versus 5.1 or better offerings.Not that Phantom (or other musical performances) can't be enjoyed without a surround system. Especially if you've NOT had the opportunity to see the live show to compare it to.So, first I'd recommend coming to New York and seeing the 5-star live performance of Phantom of the Opera on Broadway before it closes. Don't want to make the trip?...Then spend the money on a good surround system instead, and pick up the film version of Phantom for your collection. Don't want to travel? Don't want to upgrade? Already have surround? Then the film version will do just fine. Well worth the price of admission.	4.0	Masquerade!	2006-10-30	4	4	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2PJUHR9LD9XKZ	Skywalker	"Black and white images, an opera house crumbling under dust and cobwebs, half decayed opera requisites, old opera visitors from times long past participating in an auction. Then all at once a sudden bright light coming from the chandelier, spreading more and more, and the journey to the past begins. Dust is blown down, colour comes into the scenery, cobwebs are blown away, the music whirls up like an explosion of sound and the viewer is carried away into the happenings of the years 1870.A stunningly beautiful scene, and please savour it. Because it will remain more or less the best of all - unfortunately.Beginning right after the introduction, this film is packed full of clich&eacute;s and details who seem to scream the underlying intention of ""pleasing the viewer"", at the expense of authenticity and depth. My impression was that nobody who was involved in making this film was actually interested in the story and the people it concerned, what a horrifying and tragic (by the way: real in all essential features) story it wants to tell.The so-called phantom of the opera was not an English-sytle, romantic, lovestruck young man who jealously fought against his rival for the innocent maiden he had chosen like in a swashbuckler: he was a middle-aged man of outstanding intelligence and talents but, on account of his physical disfiguration, isolated, soul-crippled, emotionally tortured and bordering on insanity, who saw in the young and sensitive chorus girl Christine Da&eacute;e his only and last chance to still experience some love and happiness in this world. As depicted in this film, the phantom's looks border on ridiculous, they hardly justify a life-long estrangement from the rest of the world; in Gaston Leroux' book it was described more than enough that his face practically looked like a living skull.Christine's growing maturity into adulthood is not an issue here, and the same goes for her inner conflict when she sees herself standing between these two men; she is reduced to the role of the ""innocent"" maiden who has to be saved from the monster by her hero (even if in this case, in the end she saves herself).The film's settings are almost all very beautiful, and also the costumes, although they sometimes are annoying (e.g. the ""Think of Me"" scene where Christine looks like the Austrian empress Sissi when she should be interpreting Karthago's queen Elissa - I guess the costume makers respectively producers were of the opinion that the average filmgoer would sooner find associations with the Sissi than with the Elissa costume). Some of the special effects are simply superfluous, e.g. in the case of Christine's abduction where the mirror seems to dissolve itself, which is nonsense - of course it was a rotating mirror. At the beginning of the ""All I Ask of You"" scene Christine steps on the roof of the opera house barefoot despite the snow; only why? There is not the least reason for this, and how is a girl supposed to come into a romantic mood with frozen feet?The cast's singing voices are rather good, although of course not everyone can be such an exceptionally gifted casting for the phantom as Michael Crawford in the original performance and recording. The choreography is acceptable, too, except for the unfortunately totally uninspired ""Masquerade"".Gerard Butler cast as the phantom is, I must honestly say, alarmingly colourless in his performance, in particular in the scenes which would require some sensitiveness; the phantom as he plays him is a powerful man, romantic, dangerous, jealous, but you can hardly feel any kind of pain and passionate love in him. His singing voice is acceptable, but such a role would have required an outstanding singer, since the phantom had no chance to win his girl's heart with manly attractiveness and his only seductive power was in his beautiful voice; and for this purpose Butler I have to say is not convincing.Whose performance is unsurpassed is Minnie Driver's as Madame Carlotta, and also her song ""Primadonna"" is sung, played and choreographed best of all.But this is exactly where the film's weakness is again to be seen: one ought not to allow a minor character to steal the protagonist's show. This whole film does not take itself, the plot and the characters seriously. The viewer is not in the least confronted with the feelings the story is all about, the abysmal human cruelty and on the other hand sky-rocketing hope; everybody involved remains detached from actual pain and despair, one even has difficulties feeling with the phantom and his dark fate. Through the cheap showmanship applied in this film he was degraded to what he was in his childhood: a curious freak of nature whom you may stare at while visiting a fair with a slight, agreeable shudder to then leave him behind, not in the least touched by the tragedy of his life.Of course we do have Webber's music here, his play (even if slightly adapted, e.g. you can see a few details which were borrowed from Susan Kay and Jean Cocteau), and it is certainly true that Webber's musical did partly mitigate the story and add some romantic detail. But nevertheless it had remained a deeply touching and haunting story, not laden with clich&eacute;s and abandoned to superficiality as here. ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is a story about is deep emotions, but it was set on screen as if its origin was a comic book of sorts. (Sarcastically speaking, director Joel Schumacher seemed to think it was supposed to be just another of his Batman films.)I realize that being a fan of the musical practically from its first hour, who has known every single note and word of the score since the last twenty-five years and more, has read both Gaston Leroux' as well as Susan Kay's novel repeatedly and both in their original language and has seen different performances at different theatres one can probably only remain disappointed by a film version. Nevertheless, I did expect at least a little more commitment. It hurts to see that apparently almost no one who participated in making this film really devoted himself to it with the enthusiasm this tragic plot, the complex characters and their relationships with one another as well as the strikingly beautifully music (which Webber had written as a declaration of love for Sarah Brightman, who was his wife at the time) would have deserved.If you are interested in a beautifully made and atmospherically convincing - not perfectly made either but at least not superficial - version of the musical I would recommend the recording from the Royal Albert Hall on occasion of the 25th anniversary."	2.0	I'm still shaking my head in disbelief...

He plays the intense, self-destructive and fatally passionate phantom for his Christine (Emmy Rossum).  Check out the sizzling scene with the song ""Point of no return"".The movie had me shedding hot tears for the spectacle and strong emotions of a dangerous man scorned--a man who later suffers no consequences for his crimes of murder in the theatre (having been hardened since childhood days by his tormentors who beat him for having a disfigurement).  Except! his karmalike punishment of never having the affection of the only woman he ever loved.The reality of his merciless murders solidify Christine's decision not to be with him.  That and of couse his hideous demi-face and his over-enthusiasm to force her to be his bride too soon. Incidentally the half of his face you can see with the mask on, he's green eyed and beatiful.This lovestory is irrational and over the top--a gorgeous fantasy with a dangerous anti-hero who pays in the end with a broken heart and an eternal longing for the woman he will never attain.  For the period in which it is set, it's a typical shallow moral, telling a lot about the society at the time:  Ugly on the outside means ugly on the inside too."	5.0	Sexy Gerard Butler plays a bad boy	2005-08-28	0	0	0

But, I used to listen to the original cast recording with Michael Crawford all the time.  I thought it was great.  Jesus Christ Superstar is by far my favorite by Andrew Lloyd Webber, but Phantom always ran a close second for me.Knowing how badly JCS turned out when it went to film, I wasn't too thrilled to see Phantom on film, so I never saw it, I am very sorry to admit.  I had no idea what I was missing.However, after 300, I became a fan of Gerard Butler & I sought this out in HD: it was breath-taking.  As a comparison, I listened to my old cast CD & the movie sound track blows it away in almost every respect.Gerard Butler's voice is amazing (who would've guessed the man could sing?) & the full chorus + full orchestral sound blows the original cast CD out of the water.In fact, I loved this so much, that I first got Phantom in HD DVD and then bought it a second time in Blu-ray after HD was pronounced dead.

Carlotta seems to be a somewhat over-the-top character, and Ms. Driver plays the role to perfection, with all the mannerisms and things one would expect from a demanding diva.2) Emmy Rossum as Christine.  The time this young woman spent in the Metropolitan Opera's youth program paid off.  Her singing as Christine was exquisite, so much so that I found myself looking forward to the numbers where she sang solo, since Butler, while not bad, failed to measure up in the numbers he sang with her.All in all, it could have been better, but this film did have its moments, which is why I didn't give it the lower rating.  Gerard Butler could use some lessons at the Met himself, though.	3.0	Give Gerard Butler Some Singing Lessons!	2005-07-22	7	2	5

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3NQRQR421ZN8B	Stephanie	I've always adored 'Phantom', but have never been able to see it on stage. Finally! I've seen this movie 12 times at the theatre (with a 13th planned for tomorrow!) which is a personal, and I assure you, unsurpassable theatre-going record.It's hard to pin-point why the story and the music of 'Phantom of the Opera' has the effect that it has on me. I can listen to the music non-stop. There is something so magical about it. Gaston Leroux's wonderful and tragic novel in essence, is captured perfectly by Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical.I was never skeptical about the casting or the use of Joel Schumacher for the film. Probably because I never saw the show on stage (although I have listened to the original cast recording hundreds of times). I always maintained the perspective that you won't know until you try. It paid off. Gerry Butler is sexy, sensual, dark, tragic and enticing as the Phantom. Emmy Rossum is absolutely gorgeous, caring, naive and innocent as Christine. Patrick Wilson is dashing and romantic as Raoul. My favourite supporting character was Miranda Richardson as Mme. Giry. She superbly portrayed the caring mother figure as well as being trapped by what she knows of the Phantom.All in all, I give it a well-deserved 10/10. The DVD is supposed to be released on April 20, 2005 in Australia (though I may have to order the special 2-disc edition from the states).	5.0	Pure heaven!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3I69IXPTDVKQF	Stephen B. O'Blenis	"The latest adaptation of ""The Phantom Of The Opera"" was quite different from what I expected.  My only experience with musicals outside of Disney material like ""Cinderella"" and ""Beauty And The Beast"" (both recommended) comes from ""The Sound Of Music"" and ""The Wizard Of Oz"" (also both recommended), and for some reason I expected this version of ""Phantom"" to be full of lavish sets and singing during the rehearsals and performances of the stage company's productions (which it was) but I didn't expect so much of the film outside of those parts to be conducted in song.  At first it discombulated me a bit, but as the movie went on I was increasingly glad it had taken this route.  It was an unusual way to go for what, while being a romantic movie lush with tragedy, is still also very much a horror movie.  But the songs and musical accompaniment all through - expertly done by an extremely talented cast and ensemble of musicians - perfectly conveyed what the movie was going for.Full of grandeur, dark awe, emotion and visual magnificence, the latest version of the tale of the ill-fortuned opera house and its resident specter combs territory not fully delved into in previous versions I've seen and features cinematography that develops the most dramatic moments to maximum effectiveness.  The amount of light-hearted humor was also unexpected, but it made for some great contrasts, including the first appearance of the thunderous-voiced Phantom during a packed-house performance of one of the company's musicals, bringing the house to a shocking standstill.One of the few problems was with the Phantom's main nemesis.  He was a fine, likable character, the performer who portrayed him a great actor and a great singer, but he did not strike me as being a realistically adequate foil for the grand and often ferocious Phantom.  A defeciency that's not crippling but has slightly hobbled a few excellent horror movies over the years.The other versions of the ""Phantom"" movie I've seen are the Hammer version starring Herbert Lom and Heather Sears - not one of the best Hammer movies by a long shot, but still good, featuring an excellent turn by Michael Gough as the wickedly and humourously deplorable theater owner: it's available in the ""Hammer Horror Series"" set which also includes alltime greats like ""Nightmare"" and ""Night Creatures""; and the 1989 Robert Englund/Jill Schoelen version - a much more vicious version feauring a far less sympathetic Phantom, it also has some great music that's sadly gone unnoticed.All 3 versions recommended; I've yet to see the Lon Chaney silent version, the 40s Universal version, the 1998 ""Il Fantasma Dell'Opera"" Italian-language version, the 1916 German silent version (apparantly among a number of films from that era of which no print exists any longer, sadly), or the 1983 or 1990 made-for-tv versions."	5.0	Excellent Musical Version Of The Legendary Horror	2005-12-12	4	4	0

There were somethings that were marvelous (The ""auction"" beginning, the cemetery, the sets, art direction, costumes...) BUT THE PHANTOM COULDN'T SING !!! In fact, most of the singing was weak, breathy,and shallow. This is a story obout an OPERA, not a coffee house! The only high points for me were Minnie Driver as Carlotta, Ciran Hinds and Simon Callow as Mesrs. Andre & Firmin, and Miranda Richardson as Mdm. Giry. I didn't care about the Phantom (who looked like he was about to trip over something any second), Christine (who looked a little too young and who frequently had a ""deer in the headlights"" stare), and Roule (who looked just plain bored). But you really can't totally blame the cast, for it is ultimately the director who is responsible for everything on the screen, and Joel Schumacher just didn't dig deep enough for the right chemistry, which is integral to the story. Well, after screwing up the last two ""Batman"" films, I guess we should be grateful that he didn't have any neon to work with. This is a film for die-hard Phantom fans who can look beyond the mistakes,and enjoy it for what it is.

But, to my surprise, it was actually quite good! The awesome sets, haunting cinematography, fantastic visual effects, and great performances help to elevate it above the sometimes-mediocre songs. Gerard Butler (""Dracula 2000"") made a great Phantom, and Patrick Wilson (""The Alamo"") was good as Raoule, but Emmy Rossum (""The Day After Tomorrow"") gave the film's best performance! She's talented, beautiful, and can sing too! The supporting cast does a good job as well.I recommend the film to all fans of musicals!Movie/DVD Grade: B+"	4.0	SURPRISINGLY GOOD!	2005-05-21	3	3	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AY01SMUH5SX8A	"Steven Valenti ""svclue"""	"Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is one of the most popular musicals of all time and an undeniably exciting experience in the theater.  With its lush music, spectacular design, and slick direction by Harold Prince, the stage version already has a cinematic quality that you'd think would be a natural fit for film. Certainly ""Phantom"" would seem an easier film to make than say, Lloyd Webber's ""Evita,"" which, despite its real-life subject, has a spare, surreal quality on stage.  But the film ""Evita,"" in the capable hands of director Alan Parker, turned out to be quite brilliant--  the great score was enhanced by stunning cinematography and authentic art direction, as well as some really fine performances (yes, including Madonna's).  But, alas, Lloyd Webber trusted Joel Schumacher with this one-- that's right: he chose the director responsible for those much-hated grotesqueries ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman and Robin"" to adapt his most famous work for film.  Not a good decision.Now, to be fair, Lloyd Webber seemed to have based his choice on the fact that Schumacher directed the enjoyable teen vampire flick ""The Lost Boys"" in the 80's.  That film does give some indication that Schumacher could handle the gothic romance and supernatural elements that make ""Phantom"" so compelling on stage.  One only wishes the composer had followed up on the director's career before offering the job.  The ""Phantom"" film is less ""Lost Boys"" and very much more in the same hit- 'em- over- the-head, cartoonish style as Schumacher's Batman movies.  If he was going to choose a ""Batman"" director, it should have been Tim Burton.The best thing about the film is Emmy Rossum, who really is just about perfect as the ingenue Christine Da'ae:  Great voice, right age and look, good acting ability.  There is also some nice cinematography, especially during ""All I Ask of You,"" the rooftop love duet between Christine and Raoul (Patrick Wilson). The rest of the movie is horribly miscalculated.Aside from Rossum, the performances are weak.  Gerard Butler as the Phantom and Minnie Driver as the opera diva Carlotta, are simply too over-the-top and downright corny.  Someone, presumably Shumacher, should have reminded the cast that this is a film and not the stage production.  On stage, you can get away with a little overacting-- the theatrical emoting is needed to reach everyone in the theater.  On film, with the benefit of things like close-ups and editing, you can be more subtle.  There is a whole lot of ridiculous mugging go on here.In fact, a little more subtlety across the board could have made this a much better film.  I know many would say that Lloyd Webber's score is anything but subtle, and that's probably true.  But the stage version of ""Phantom,"" is sort of understated in some important ways.  Above all, the show coasts on the music more than character development and plot.  The music is so emotionally involving that you hardly notice that you really know next to nothing about Christine or the Phantom, or anyone else.  And it works really well.  On stage, the emotional pull of the music and the staging fills in the gaps in the storytelling.  There really is a spare, mysterious quality to ""Phantom"" on stage that is completely absent from the film.The film is full of distracting and unnecessary additions.  Shumacher goes to great lengths to strip the musical of its mystery and gothic elements-- what was dark, brooding, and mysterious on stage is now too colorful, too flamboyant, and utterly devoid of anything supernatural.  The film goes out of its way to explain all the Phantom's actions in entirely practical terms.  For instance, Carlotta does not mysteriously lose her voice by potentially otherworldly means.  No, here, the Phantom is seen blatantly placing a presumably poisoned bottle of throat spray within her reach.  Least forgivable is a silly flashback scene with a voice over by Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson) explaining the Phantom's origin.  On stage, her explanation is quick and vague, almost a throwaway--  it's much better that way.  Do we really need everything spelled out for us?The big musical numbers, which should be the highlight, are dragged down by bad choices.  Everything is too busy.The most ludicrous example of this comes during ""Point of No Return,"" which should be an emotional highpoint.  The Phantom appears disguised on stage during the performance of his opera, and his duet with Christine doubles as a commentary on their complex relationship.  Instead of focusing squarely on the Phantom and Christine, Schumacher undermines the emotion of the scene by intercutting images of some entirely inappropriate and laughably modern- seeming backup dancers.  Why?At the end of the day, this is just a bad adaptation of a good musical.  I hate the idea that anyone who hasn't seen the stage version would form an opinion based on this film.  In fact, it would have been wiser, more entertaining, and immeasurably cheaper, if they had just filmed a stage performance and distributed that."	2.0	An unsatisfying adaptation of a good musical	2005-10-20	20	7	13
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2KF537PVPSDBB	Steve Sussman	This movie desserved to be nominated for best picture. I mean who can't like it. It had a boutiful story. The music was unbelievable. How didn't Learn to be lonely win in the academy awards. Phantom desserved to win all 3 of the awards it was up for in the academy awards. This movie is about an opera singer Christine Daee. She hears a voice every day when she is praying for her father. She thinks it is the ghost of her father, but what she doesn't know is that this voice is an actual man. this actual man is the opera ghost. The phantom takes Christine down to his Lair. He wants her to marry him. The movie gets even scarier, when you find out the history of the phantom. If you want to see a great movie then I reccomend you to see the phantom of the opera. You'll be walking out of the movie singing music of the night.	5.0	Unbelievable	2005-03-26	9	6	3

Better than Michael Crawford who never seemed to be comfortable at the higher range.I say 'sadly' 'cos this may have been more enjoyable for me if I had  seen the movie first. It was enjoyable, to a point. I note they added extra bits, like the sword fight in the cemetery. I guess if you have the freedom of a movie why not use it?As an aside, my wife has seen the stage show here in Melbourne about a dozen times and agreed that Warlowe is the best.We also saw the sequel in London, 'Love never Dies'. At the time we thought maybe it should have. When it came to Melbourne with a new cast and Andrew Lloyd Webber saw the production they had put on here he evidently decided to take this version to Broadway. We saw it here in Melbourne. We agreed it was better that the London version, but still felt that Love Should have Died.	3.0	Prefer the stage show but worth a look.	2013-03-06	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2KVUYPLEW4LXT	"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time"""	"After what seems like an eternity of hoping, wishing, waiting, and wondering, one of the greatest Broadway musicals ever to infect American Pop Culture is at long last shining in the big screen for all to see. Finally, finally, FINALLY all of the mystery, music, and magic is ours for to be experienced again and again for far less than the price of a stage theater ticket.I remember when the Phantom of the Opera first appeared on the stage, at the time I was a young child. EVERYONE was talking about it. Everyone was seeing it. And everyone loved it. Some merely bought the T-shirts, the soundtracks, and various other memorabilia, while others became full-blown fanatics, going to see every Andrew Lloyd Webber musical they could find. As for me myself, I went years listening to the brilliant score and never quite understanding it. Although Phantom is a highly theatrical experience, the music does indeed stand on its own. When I actually saw the show in San Francisco (in my teens) it all came together even moreso in a way that I shall never forget. Needless to say I had high hopes for this film. But with all the delays and rumors floating around I also had a healthy dose of fear of what might happen to my beloved musical. That largely subsided however, when I saw the first awesome teaser trailer making use of the awesome musical score and some breath-taking cimematography. I went to the film hoping for the unthinkable. I was not disappointed.First of all I have to say that I absolutely love the score to The Phantom of the Opera. I'm sure I'm not alone in the opinion that it is the finest score Andrew Lloyd Webber ever wrote. While seeing it live on stage sung by actors before your very eyes is one thing, hearing it in crystal-clear digital sound through massive theater speakers is quite another. Especially when you consider that the score had not been re-mastered, but re-recorded, played bigger, brighter, and more beautifully than ever (thanks to a carefully picked symphony orchestra). Honestly, from the moment that chandelier started moving the score had my full attention, and it never let go through the whole movie. Heck, I think it's worth seeing the movie for the musical score alone. But as this is a musical there IS singing.Much has already been said about Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, but as they aren't in this movie I'm going to be objective and instead focus on the people who ARE in it ;) Emmy Rossum. I'll say it again. EMMY ROSSUM. Oh my. She is AWESOME. Granted, I had long thought that nothing could compete with the original cast, and Christine's part in particular. Because of this, it took a song or two for me to realize just how incredible her singing is. Is it perfect? No. Is it blow the doors down powerful? No. What then? It's PURE. Her voice is like an angel. It's innocent and sweet and emotionally charged. It holds your attention and doesn't let go. In other words, it is perfect for the PART that she plays, the part of Christine. I dare say that she IS the character while you are watching this movie, and her performance really and truly holds this film together, as everything hinges on her. Of course I could go on and on about how she's gorgeous, and how her acting is just SO incredible, about how she may redefine what people think of when they say ""Christine from Phantom of the Opera"". But there is so much more...I know what you're thinking. What about the Phantom? When I first saw the actual film trailer I was skeptical. Gerard Butler is not an Opera singer, he's an actor. So when he's the character the film is named after in the biggest musical-to-film adaptation since who knows when you have to wonder. But just watch the movie and take his performance on its own merits. While his singing may lack the smoothness of others (indeed he snaps and growls some of the lyrics), he is at no time BAD. His singing is powerful, and emotional, the two most vital things (to say nothing of from the heart). And then there's his acting. I know people who are crazed fans of this guy (both men and women) and there's no denying that his acting is always at least above average, if not superb.  As you watch the film Point of No Return and the Phantom's final scenes in particular should grab your attention (okay, I cried the second time I saw the film). To summarize: due to the fact that Phantom of the Opera is really a dramatic work, the slight weakness of his Butler's voice is more than made up for in the strength of his acting (both bodily and vocally). Anyone who has watched the stage play will probably know about I mean when I say that the Phantom needs to be a suave, cool, handsome character (with the exception of his horrid half-face), and in my opinion Butler nails the character down better than any actor I can think of could have. Bravo.The other members of the cast likewise give wonderful performances all-around. The mysterious Madame Giry, the child-like Meg, and the deliciously over-the-top Carlotta are all fabulously played by their respective actors (Miranda Richardson, Jennifer Ellison, and Minnie Driver respectively). Our Raoul, (Patrick Wilson) comes across more as a calm voice of sanity in the sea of strong character types than as a romantic lead, but his singing is solid and his looks handsome enough (his acting isn't bad either).The real star of the show though, is the incredible rendition of the classic score, the mesmorizing visuals, and the utterly immersive spell the film weaves through its short 2 1/2 hours. In this day and age, special effects are often used for the sake of special effects, and the shaky hand-held cameras are enough to make you lose your lunch. Even worse, hardly anyone seems to recall what a great musical is, let alone knows how to make one. This film is a perfect example of what a musical should be. The special effects are like magic (from the photographs that turn real to the theater that is restored to its former glory, to the phantom who disappears in flash of light and a blaze of fire), the musical numbers are grand (Masquerade is simply glorious), and there are is no filler that I can see. The synchronization of the actors with their vocals is perfect (no where did it look like an obvious overdub [brief reminder: musicals HAVE to use overdubs for wide shots!]), the balance between orchestra and vocals is superb, the chemistry between key players is wonderful.The beauty of the camerawork, set design, and overall visual feel of the movie really can't be overstated. Everything is just so vibrant, beautiful, and crystal-clear. Everything feels like a dream, like a distant memory where everything has become more pronounced and exaggerated over time. The theater is so bright and beautiful, the graveyard so gothic and atmospheric, the snow-covered rooftop so romantic, and the costumes so sumptuous that you are completely caught-up in the world. This is NOT reality. This is the world seen through the memory of the dreams of youth. This is the Phantom of the Opera."	5.0	"""He's here. The Phantom of the Opera..."""	2004-12-29	12	11	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2CU8C0GIJPJI	Sue Hotzel	Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler gave a powerful performance as Christine Daae and the Phantom. Rossum's voice showed an extraordinary amount of color and flexibility for a teenager. Butler's voice sometimes maxed out on top, but his performance of Music of the Night was completely seductive. I could have done without Raoul's mullet, but his duet with Rossum was sublime. I love the effect when Christine puts the Phantom's ring on before offering herself to him to save Raoul's life. In the play he forcibly puts in on her finger as he proposes to her in front of the audience. My one complaint is I wish I could put it on a DVD so I can watch it on my TV with a bigger screen.	4.0	Great Performance	2013-10-27	0	0	0

I honestly don't know what the producers were thinking when they cast Gerald Butler. I was so upset when I first saw the Phantom. When I saw him, I thought: ""he's sexy!"" Wait: he's sexy? The Phantom is not supposed to be hot, he's supposed to be grotesque and horribly deformed. And his voice in the movie was horrible, it sounded like he was either growling or yelling through all of his songs. But it wasn't solely Butler's fault. I really hated the way the Phantom was created to be a mere man. In the stage version, the Phantom is somewhat of a mystical being. We don't understand how he makes Carlotta's voice croak or how he makes the chandelier fall. He just does it. It made the Phantom one of the most engaging characters to be in theatre. Besides the Phantom, though, I thought they did the film well. It was visually stunning, and they brought out strong performances in Emmy Rossum and the women who played Madame Giry. This film is recommended, but I strongly advise to see it on stage. That is the truly haunting version."	3.0	Movie Magic is missing	2007-01-01	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A20RYH1598D76R	"Susie Griffin ""Susie G"""	Like most fans of the stage version, I threw a bit of a wobbler when the cast for the screen version was announced. Largely because I wasn't really familiar with any of their previous work. I have however, been pleasantly surprised.First things first: Visually this film is overwhelming. The restoration of the theatre to it's glory days it's absolutely breath-taking going from a black and white grainy picture to glorious technicolor splendour. (A tad similiar to some sequences in Moulin Rouge perhaps? But hey, if it ain't broke don't fix it!) The costumes are magnificent including Christines not so innocent white dressing gown that conveniently splits to reveal a glimpse of thigh. Make-up, wigs, props and lighting not to mention the flawless sets (Phantom's lair - wow) are superb and really do the stage show justice. There wasn't one part of the film that I could criticise visually. Even the costumes for the Masquerade ball, which were primarily black and white served purpose in making the Phantom's Scarlet red costume stand out the instant he appeared.Emmy Rossum (Christine) Emmy really does look beautiful in the part and sings very well. My one criticism was that I felt she didn't have enough passion for the role. There are certain times in the show where I always feel that Christine is on the verge of a nervous breakdown as a result of this stalker who just won't leave her be and I just didn't feel that with Rossum. I think she maybe under played her role a bit too much.Gerard Butler (Phantom) My good God. What an actor. I can honestly say that watching this film was the first time I really listened to The Music of the Night and understood what it is really about. He might not be the best singer but lets face it folks, Michael Crawford was hardly Pavarotti but what Butler and Crawford have in common is the wonderful portrayal of a somewhat schizophrenic character. Butler has so much presence on the screen it's scary. His commanding stature when the mask is on portrays an understated sex appeal, but the second that mask is off his posture changes and makes for an angry, tormented soul who has been denied love his whole life. The moment where Christines kisses him reduced me to tears because it's only then you realise how pathetic he really is. Simply fabulous.Patrick Wilson (Raoul) Great voice! Probably the best vocal performance. I didn't feel that he was the knight in shining armour that he should be. All I ask of you lacked passion and determination.Minnie Driver (Carlotta) Fabulously demanding, wonderfully over the top. Even though it's not her singing, she does a wonderful job with the singing facial expressions. Most of the time it looks like she might explode and provides some of the films best comic relief.As far as any minor changes from the stage production go, no complaints. The demise of the chandelier was fabulous where it was in the film. Any bits of sing-song that were cut or otherwise spoken weren't missed.One mistake. All I ask of you on the roof. It shouldn't have been snowing. Three months later in the Graveyard its still snowing. I didn't realise France had such a bad climate in the late 1800's. All I ask of you was supposed to be the height of summer. But now I'm just being picky.

No - a ""canned"" film version will never be as good as a live stage performance - but, I think this one comes as close as possible.  I love this play, and I actually like how they made the Phantom out to be a little more human and realistic in this version.  In this version, we see and feel the Phantom's pain and suffering and longing for Christine.  Yes, it makes him a more ""tame"" version of the Phantom; but I liked that.  The scene when the Phantom witnesses Christine and the Viscount declaring their love for each other - you can just feel the anguish he's experiencing knowing that his precious Christine cares deeply for someone else.  It's the ultimate heartache of unrequited love, and this emotion comes across vividly on the screen.  This version almost makes you root for the Phantom to win Christine in the end, and I think that is what makes it so special.  It's a heart-wrenching love story, and I was enchanted throughout the whole movie.  If you are a ""Phantom"" buff, this is a worthy production."	5.0	Spectacular Production	2006-03-29	3	2	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A102154QQC1T03	SuzyPhantom	I didn't know what to think of the remake. But above all I totally love the music! And the storyline is wonderful! Gerard Butler had a hard role to fill as the Phantom, I think he is pretty young for the character, but all in all he does what he can. Some was a little violence, but you had the idea of that with the play version anyway. I think it brings chills to anyone watching it, and in my opinion is still a great film.. but others expected Michael Crawford in the role he created.. and yes he still could have done it.  He has the most beautiful and expressive hands and his voice brings you to your knees. Still, I expect the viewers might want a  younger cast though... the film is considered a triangle gothic love story and does bring alot of tears to one's eyes.	5.0	The return of the Phantom	2005-08-28	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2N23QIOQXXXZC	"S. Wright ""La Khari"""	"The Phantom of the Opera is a movie that teaches people not to judge people by their appearance. The message isn't even the best part though. It's the plot that is amazing!Christine Daae is a girl/woman (phantom always calls her child but she looks grown to me) who lives in the opera dormitories of the opera house (Opera Populaire). She introduces her voice to Paris when Charlotta (prima donna) leaves. Everyone is absolutely astounded by her voice including the Phantom of the Opera, Erik, (but they just call him the phantom in the movie). After Christine's amazing understudy performance the Raul, childhood friend/ lover of Christine, comes to her room and talks with her but the really big thing that happens after Christine's performance is the phantom introduces her to the music of the night. He tells Christine ""I need you with me to serve me to sing"" talk about MUSIC!The Phantom, Gerard Butler, performs an amazing song, The Music of the Night. It's beautiful! Anyway, let me stop telling the story. The movie is amazing and needs to be on your before-I-die-to-do-list. The movie made me see the world in a whole new way and is one with my soul. Watch it.

I also love the original soundtrack.  I couldn't wait for the movie to be released and must say that it did not disappoint.  Costuming was amazing.  Bringing the details to screen (when there are limitations on stage) was a joy to see.  Overall the singing and acting was excellent.  I agree with other comments regarding the ""Phantom's voice"" not necessarily being the best it could have been.  (Also we saw a bit too much of the mangled Phantom face then we needed to which was very Hollywood-esque).  However this didn't change my overall view of the film.  The actresses who played Christine and Carlotta were both excellent and a joy to watch.  This is a true Must See!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1UMDTZQD96KX3	Syragoth	"After seeing this movie 3 times, bawling my eyes out at the end credits, immersing myself in the beautiful soundtrack, and gazing at the beautiful sets, I have come to one conclusion:  This is an absolutely amazing, fabulous movie!Of course, my main point of interest going into the movie theater that day was to hear the music.  I had never seen the stage production, but from what people told me, it was supposed to be spectacular.  And it was.  But, there were so many other great things about this film.  As I mentioned before, the sets were breathtakingly beautiful.  Lots of gold and brilliant, bright colors swirling together to make a marvelous parade of color, and then the dark, dreariness of the Phantom's ""lair"" and the catacombs beneath the opera house... it's all enough to make this girl faint!Speaking of making girls faint, Gerard Butler certainly does a good job of it.  After the movie, my mom wouldn't shut up about how ""beyond sexy"" he was.  She still won't, in fact, and she's seen the movie more times than me!  But, besides her obessive ramblings, I totally agree.  He is H-O-T!!!  And I really love his singing voice.  He's so passionate and put's so much emotion into his performance... it was him I was crying for at the end of the movie.  God, how could Christine have been such an idiot?!  I certainly wouldn't have gone for the conniving wimp that is Raoul.  I want the Phantom!  But I digress...As far as singing goes, I think all the actors did quite well, particularly Gerard Butler.  To all those people out there who keep whining about Michael Crawford being sooo good and such a godsend, for god's sake, keep an open mind!  These new actors are just as good (perhaps better) as the original cast.Well, I'm off to see it again.  And I'm sure it will be just as entertaining as the first time.(Oh, and just a little something for you other Phantom maniacs: in the scene when the Phantom is taking Christine to his underground lair for the first time [her wearing her frilly dress and stockings] and lays her down in his bed and just leaves her there [yeah right, like he would just leave her there...], notice that when she gets up in the morning, the stockings are gone!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2X6PL6O6ZYZJZ	S. Zemach	While I am a huge fan of the musical I was rather disappointed with the film. The good:-Amazing costume and set design-Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry is fantastic, she has the most genuine emotion out of all the characters-Gerard Butler: His vocal delivery is defferent then Michael Crawford's but still is full of the emotion that is generally lacking in the movie. The error in character is the fault of the filmaker, the Phantom comes off as pathetic, not dangerous.-Minnie Driver is hilarious as Carlotta, regardless of whether or not her voice is dubbedAnd now the bad:-Patrick Wilson: Although he may have a beautiful voice, I did not believe a single word. His delivery is stiff and hollow, a beautiful voice is not enough to carry the character.-Emmy Rossum: While she does have a gorgeous soprano voice, it is quiet and breathy and does not seem to fit the part. Listen to Sarah Brightman's voice on the original soundtrack to hear the difference. I just wish her voice was stronger. And why the same facial expression the entire movie?-Some added scenes, they don't really contribute-Spoken lyrics...NO...never again...please, they don't sound like dialougue they sound like badly acted lines and it isn't fair to the actors.I would recommend the film to anyone who is a fan or thouroghly appreciates musicals, otherwise I'd steer clear and go see it on stage.	3.0	A Weak Screenplay	2005-12-25	6	4	2
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1QA05L7DFT2CG	T758YU8593	I saw this DVD and I enjoyed it quite a bit. It is different from the stage production, but it is understandable. I was about to put this DVD away when I noticed the other language on the disc was French. So I decided to give it a try.I was totally blown away! The French version was amazing! Now this is the Phantom I was hoping for. I don't know French, but who needs to be fluent in it. I know all the English words already. The story is supposed to be set in Paris so the language made this film come to life with artistic style. The person who sings the part of the Phantom in French is infinitely better than the english version. He truly captures the true essence of the Phantom. The other actors also sound much better and it makes the movie even more fantastic. Christine truly echos amazingly in the journey to the Phantom's lair. All in all, I must say I recommend this DVD, and it is best heard with it's French soundtrack. It is not to be missed.	5.0	Amazing French Soundtrack Included	2005-05-16	8	5	3
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1F12Z261SG59L	"tacfire ""FFE"""	As a big fan of the musical, this movie adaptation was really well done. The music is wonderfully intact, some of the sequencing makes more sense (e.g. chandelier crash toward end), and the black and white present day scenes  are beautifully done.The leads are good, especially Christine. Butler's vocals don't pare up to the unparalleled Michael Crawford, but his acting is excellent, especially the Masquerade scene.Missed the full Red Death get-up, but I guess Butler's emoting would not have been as powerful talking through a huge skull-head!In the musical, the Phantom is always one step ahead and somewhat above the regular folks, adding to the mystery. He seems to perform almost magical stunts on several occasions, e.g. causing Carlotta's croaking, disappearing from Masquerade ball in a puff of smoke, shooting fireballs, gesturing the portcullis up, and the last scene disappearing act. We always felt like the Phantom had some supernatural element about him.Interestingly, ALW and Shumacher take pains to reveal the Phantom going through his machinations: Locking Christine's door, Meg revealing the sliding mirror, dropping through the floor from Masquerade ball where Raoul follows, and most obviously, the sword fight that he loses! Quite a difference from the stage version.Then, at the end, they bring back the magic. Had they ended with the Phantom simply escaping through a shattered mirror, it would have been a huge letdown. But the cemetery scene, with sad, oboe-tinged music, and the rose w/ring, obviously placed there recently, was the perfect ending.Very much a worthy adaptation.	4.0	Much better than I expected!	2005-05-14	11	8	3

Franco ""Tammy"""	"I did not see this movie when it came out in theaters, because like so many ""Phantom"" stage fans, I figured it would be a disappointment.  My only disappointment, having seen Phantom on DVD about 25 times now, is that I didn't get to see Gerard Butler play the Phantom on the big screen.  For those who criticize the film for being ""too different"" than the play, I say this:  IT IS DIFFERENT!  It's a film! And while Phantom was always my #1 favorite play (until I saw Wicked last year), I love the film 10 times more.  Gerard Butler was SO PHENOMENAL as the Phantom that I had to immediately look up his bio, as I had never heard of this actor.  I am now his biggest fan. His voice is incredible, both melodic and manly, mysterious and realistic at the same time.  The chemistry between Gerard and Emmy Rossum (whose performance is beyond words)is so powerful that you can feel the heat coming off the screen.  It is by far the BEST romantic pair casting I have seen in years.  No one shows more than a bit of bare shoulder or a bit of bare chest, and there is hardly any physical contact, but Gerard and Emmy nevertheless drink each other in and leave you yearning for just a taste.  I read one review that said that Gerard had the unfortunate job of being ""the guy who isn't Michael Crawford.""  Are you insane?  I would say that Crawford has the unfortunate job of being ""the guy that Gerard Butler buried.""  Other critics say Gerard's Phantom is too young and sexy - these critics must be jealous old guys.  The Phantom should be young, forget what the book says - an older Phantom in love with the teenage Christine is just creepy.  As for sexy, THANK YOU Mr. Schumacher for finally giving us such a sexy Phantom that you don't even mind the disfigured face - I'd still kiss him without flinching!  Gerard's innate sensuality is evident in the way he uses every part of his body to display his passion for Christine: the way his cheeks tremble with sadness made my heart break for him and moved me to tears several times;  the way he glides, hips first in an almost cocky swagger yet possessed with regal confidence and pure carnal machoism - will make every woman want him and every man jealous of him.  I could go on and on about the gorgeous cinematography, the costumes, the scenery, etc., but just GO SEE THIS MOVIE."	5.0	Move over Michael Crawford, there's a new Phantom in town	2005-08-02	6	2	4

Andrew Lloyd Webber purchased back the rights to this so he could make the film he wanted to make to leave for all time and for fans of the musical, I think he succeeded.This is not a movie of the stage version.  This movie allows you to get close to the characters.  Hear them sing to each other rather than having to project out over a large theatre.  See the feelings on their faces and their emotions.  In addtion, you are treated to a lavish spectacle of a 19th century Paris Opera house with all the trimmings.I will be buying the DVD to savor for years to come but I recommend you see it in the movie theatres while you can.	5.0	Don't miss this in the theaters	2005-01-20	6	5	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A8KISPRV870PJ	Teresa A. Aughenbaugh	"Okay, first of all, I'll be honest and admit that I have never seen the Broadway Production of the Phantom of the Opera. Because of this, I'm not going to get into some big Gerard Butler vs. Micheal Crawford thingy here. The only singing that I have seen Micheal Crawford do is on the 2nd disc of this movie. Now, to my actual review.I loved this movie!! I would highly recommend purchasing it, I believe that it is totally worth it!! The movie itself is wonderful. Miranda Richardson is excellent as Madame Giry, I don't think the producers could have picked a better actress for that role. Likewise, Jennifer Ellison is excellent as Meg Giry. Minnie Driver brings humor and fun to the role of Carlotta. I thought the casting for this movie was exceptional.Emmy Rossum deserved every bit of acclaim that she received for this movie. She did an exceptional job, and her voice is superb for that of a sixteen year old. You could really tell that Rossum totally threw herself into this role: she is an awesome young actress!! Patrick Wilson did a pretty good job with Raoul. Raoul isn't my favorite character in this movie, but that is totally just my opinion. I thought Patrick's singing could have been better, but again, that is also just my opinion. Now, for Gerard Butler. I admit that I am a fan of Butler's. However, I also confess that I wasn't a fan before I saw this movie. Gerard Butler is INSANE in this role!! His singing is incredible for a first-timer, and the passion and pain with which he portrays the incredibly real-seeming Phantom is also incredible. I'm not going to compare him to Michael Crawford, but I do think that the producers couldn't have picked a better Phantom. Butler should be getting much more acclaim for this role that no one could have played better.As for the movie itself, there is some violence, etc. but it is still wonderful!! I almost cried when watching it.The 2nd disc is also wonderful. The special features are interesting and sometimes (as in the cast & crew singalong) hysterical. Again, I almost cried when watching the deleted scene ""No one Would Listen"". Butler brings incredible emotion to that song . . . I'm sorry that it wasn't included in the film.Well, that's the end of my 'hopefully' honest review. I'll end with the thought that i began with: this is an insanely good movie!!!"	5.0	A (Hopefully) Honest Review	2005-08-31	3	2	1

I wound up loving this movie so much I had to buy it. I don't have anything negative to say about it. As a matter of fact it's one of the few times I find a movie better than the book.All the actors were great and it was well cast. I don't know how the original movie compares to this one but I doubt it was better. I also can not believe some of the negatives reviews here about Gerard and the movie. I am SHOCKED at how many people gave it 1 to 2 stars. Not because I am a fan of Gerard's, but If I didn't think he did a great job I would admit it, but Gerard was ""amazing' as the Phantom and I loved his singing. Actually I thought Gerard was way too handsome for the part but more than happy he was cast in the movie. And personally,I would've picked the Phantom over Raoul anytime if he looked anything like Gerard Butler, disfigured or not. I even purchased music from Itunes to my Ipod because I loved how Gerard sang. Yeah some people didn't like his singing but to each their own. If you listen to what the director said, they weren't looking for someone who sang great but obviously they liked his voice. If it was so bad I don't think he would've been cast for the part or they would've dubbed his voice. I am glad his singing was not dubbed,that would've been disapponinting for me.I also can't believe anyone would find Gerard Butler 'ugly'. wow. I guess the saying of 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder' really is true. Why someone or some people would even say that about him is very rude and immature. I could see if someone said they didn't find the man attractive but to call him 'ugly' is out of line. There really is no reason for name calling. Ever heard the saying 'If you can't say something nice about someone, don't say anything at all.' And that anyone would call him a bad actor is another shocker. I think he is one of the most talented actors out there. But that is my opinion. I think he is GREAT."	5.0	ONE OF THE BEST MUSICAL MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN	2011-05-11	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A342EHO42V2G38	"Terran ""Terran"""	For the DVD special edition, what's surprising is what's missing from the package, and this is what I find galling in our current atmosphere of overly produced DVD extras (often the films take less time than the documentary extras!  got a week to watch a DVD package for any Lord of the Rings film?)  In this case, namely the old-hollywood style screentest of leading lady Emmy Rostum and also the informal (he already had the job)presentation of Patrick's Wilson's vocal ability to the composer.  Only snippets are included in this package on the documentary of the making of the film.  This hurts the overall package, as does the lack of releasing to the audience more of the filming of the score and our actors singing their parts for the soundtrack in the recording studio.  Was this not to see the struggles with lead phantom?  The extras and also the casting of the phantom himself are why the DVD gets a 4 star rating from me.  The phantom is suitably virile and threatening and I have no problem with him in the part physically, but the lack of vocal ability of this performer - though he's rough-edged, this phantom, they could have hired a rough-edged though on-key singer (such as a new Roger Daltry) - makes for several cringing moments.  It's such a breath of fresh air for the listener when we're back to the professionals of Emmy R & Patrick W, who are the romantic leads.  They sing with such ease, every note is truly like an additional breath to them, it makes the audience even more aware of how the phantom is straining valiantly to keep his end up, and sometimes losing the battle.  A psychological preparation for how the phantom loses out to the smooth hero in the end? Regarding the film itself, I think it's achieved it's purpose of being an old-fashioned, though rock music oriented, beautiful vision.  It is, in fact, one of the more beautiful films to watch, so as eye-candy it fulfills it's obligations in the set design, costumes, cinematography and the two male leads.  One can clearly see the influence of the director's earlier film LOST BOYS in the night scenes and the lair of this phantom.  For Emmy Rostum, this will probably be the highlight of her career, featuring her spirit and her voice and professionalism.  It's hard to top this heroine for a role!  For Patrick Wilson, he was already a lead actor/star in Broadway musicals and as a dramatic actor in the prestigious production of ANGELS IN AMERICA, so this is probably just a continuation of his singular step up the ladder.	4.0	coulda been a contender	2005-12-05	5	4	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3N1YM8X39MSX4	Terry W. Brown	Top 5 All-time Favorites!  Why this classic-to-be didn't walk away with every single award in every single category is a mystery to me.  I've seen it on stage several times and watched the DVD countless times - and each time I still want to clap at the end.  Why Emmy Rossum went from this ultimate plateau to a sleeze on on a beyond-reality TV junker baffles me - and I'm no purist.  But, I suppose it would not be ever possible to reach higher than her perfect female lead role in Phantom.  The male role of the Phantom, played by Butler, is, by definition, the featured role, but she stole the show - as a teenager. But if you are considering it for the first time, it is a musical - and perhaps even more &#34;opera-etic&#34; than most. But I don't know why I am even saying any of this since surely everyone has already seen this masterpiece. Just my opinion. For a twist, see the Andrew Lloyd Weber sequel - which is poor in comparison but takes the female role to a surprising, almost shocking but contrived outcome.  Seems the Phantom did the deed after all.	5.0	GREAT - at any price, ALWAYS!	2013-09-13	0	0	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2N1GNTB7CYTUK	tessrk	"This is a good story gone down the drain.  Many flaws in my opinion, which I'll get to later.  First, I think it would be best if I mentioned the things I DID like:1) The music.  Despite occasional poor orchestrations, it was an enjoyment to listen to.2) The art direction...gorgeous.3) The lighting.  Simply resplendent.  (Not counting the Phantom's home, which I'd prefer to be darker.)Now for the fun part...criticizm:1) The casting of the main characters, especially that of Gerard Butler as the Phantom.  If you're a fan of Michael Crawford's portrayal as the Phantom, you'll most likely dispise this.  Butler can't sing OR act.The rest of the cast was fairly annoying, (especially Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds as the managers) but they were as deities in comparison to Butler.2) The editing.  Where on earth is the entirety of the second ""Letters"" scene?  And why was the last part of the overture cut?3) Movie mistakes...is it just me, or did the Phantom's hair go from brown to blonde at the end of the movie?  And how did Christine magically get dark eyeshadow on while going to the Phantom's home?4) The choreography...so dysfunctional...5) The costume design in the ""Masquerade"" scene.  Whatever happened to ""Flash of mauve, splash of puce, fool and king, ghoul and goose...green and black, queen and priest, face of mule, face of beast...""  (Isn't that how it went???)  Almost all of the costumes were black, gold or white.  (Not to mention that the chorus was weak...)So with all this, believe me...don't waste your time.T.K., 14"	2.0	Don't waste precious time	2006-08-11	20	7	13
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AR1CZDXODLWTS	Texan Girl	"I just finished watching this film which declares itself to be ""a breathtaking feature-film"".  Feature-film it may be, but it is far from breathtaking.The film does have it's finer moments, such as the lavish costumes and dazzling sets.  Before viewing the film, I had thought The Phantom of the Opera a musical restricted to the stage.  Although I still prefer this musical live to the film version, The Phantom made the jump from stage musical to movie very admirably, in my opinion.  At times, the movie is able to enhance techniques used in the theater, like the transition from the auction to the opera house as it used to be and the change during the song ""Think of Me"".However, the film has some rough spots.  I was most disappointed by the leads.  One would think that, for the casting of a musical, the filmmaker would look first for a voice strong enough to carry the role, then determine the singer whose loooks are right for the part.  And yet, the casting of the main characters seems to have been made in an opposite manner.  Gerard Butler shows little to no feeling and, while Emmy Rossum is very pretty and has a lovely voice, she spends most of the film with an expression of surprise (or is it awe?) on her face and her mouth open.  There are also times when her voice is too weak to handle the demands of Christine Daae.  Patrick Wilson was nice as Raoul, but only that.  Perhaps Raoul would have been better portrayed with more passion, emotion, and strength.I was also quite disappointed by the Masquerade number.  Even taking into consideration that this was the film and not the stage version, perhaps the director would have done well to follow the lead of the stage production.  Rather than creating a dizzying display of colors and costumes (which the lyrics of the song describe), the costumes are conservative and quite dull.  Even the choreography doesn't manage to salvage what should be a very spectacular song.All in all, the film was nicely made.  I enjoyed watching it, but there were times when I felt that it was lacking.  In all honesty, I wish I could give this film 3 and a half stars.  It was a nice film, but, with stronger acting and singing, it could have been absolutely breathtaking."	3.0	A nice film that could have been better.	2005-06-19	13	6	7
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3G8DK3AB5L9MA	T. Gibbons	"I was anxious to see this DVD, having seen the production on Broadway.  It did not disappoint as a movie.  However, the sound reproduction is very poor.  I have home theatre and it still amazes me, when I watch movies, how much the sound/music elevates the experience.  Since ""Phantom"" is a movie of a musical, I had high expectations of the 5.1 surround orchestration and vocals.  There is very little sound separation among the 5 channels during the musical segments, and even very little during dialogue/sound effects.  I actually had to stop the movie about 15 minutes into it to make sure I didn't have it in Stereo mode on the Menu.  The sound levels also go from very quiet in speaking parts, causing one to turn up the volume, to sudden high-decibel music, shaking the room and causing my 7 year old to have to cover her ears.  This is not uncommon in movies, but this one seems to be particularly faulty in that regard.I have DVD Audio discs of classical music and they are an amazing format to listen to.  I certainly didn't think I would be disappointed with the audio in this movie, but was.  I also have a DVD of the movie ""Chicago"", and the sound on it is incredible, layered, and lively.  ""The Phantom"" would have benefitted greatly from a similar mix."	4.0	Good movie, terrible sound	2005-05-04	4	3	1

In many places I cannot distinguish where one song ends and another one begins.Still, there's no way to ruin the ""Think of Me"" song at the beginning.  It's a masterpiece.  I'm glad it isn't near the end, because if it was someone like me would be too tired of the constant music at that point to appreciate it.I think the casting is good, especially the guy who plays the Phantom, but for goodness sakes, if someone in the movie accounced that he had to go to the bathroom, he would have found a way to sing his predicament instead of say it."	3.0	I Guess I Wasn't Comfortable With A Single Two-Hour Long Song	2009-12-25	2	1	1

Canar	After reading many critical reviews, I saw the film three times(after seeing it on stage at least five times), and now have purchased the DVD. While I agree that the phantom's voice was not as strong as others who have been on stage, I found it to be a minor distraction. Looking at the second disk, I gained a lot of insight into how Andrew Lloyd Weber worked with Carmen Macintosh and Hal Prince to put the pieces together. I also realized that Sarah Brightman was not much older than the actress who played Christine in the film, when the show opened years ago. Although I have seen the various films of Phantom throughout the years, certainly Michael Crawford was not hideous or grotesque, in the stage play nor were any who played the part in any of the traveling companies. I wouldn't have expected the actor in the movie to be either. If the purists were disappointed,they are in the minority, and fail to understand that the movie had to appeal to the full spectrum of movie audiences, rather than the small percentage who demand a strict adherance to the original script.	4.0	Helped me put all of the pieces together	2005-05-06	1	0	1

The story-line of the video has some variations from the Andrew Lloyd Weber stage production but carries the spirit of the original musical.  The vocals are very good but if you have heard Michael Crawford (the original phantom) sing and act the parts, you might be spoiled.I recommend The Phantom of the Opera to anyone who has not experienced the actual stage performance.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"Andrew Lloyd Weber must be spinning in his grave. Oh, wait. He's not dead. And he used his own money to produce the film version of his mega-hit musical ""Phantom of The Opera""? What went wrong?The Opera Populaire enjoys a loyal, devoted public. Unfortunately, they are being held hostage at the hands of a tempremental, egotistical chanteuse by the name of Carlotta (Minnie Driver). Fed up with all of the headaches, the owner of the Opera sells it to Firmin and Andre (Ciaran Hands and Simon Callow), two junk merchants eager to become respectable, backed by Raoul (Patrick Wilson), a young, rich benefactor. They soon have to find a replacement for Carlotta, and Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson), suggests Christine (Emmy Rossum), a young prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the Phantom (Gerard Butler). She does an outstanding job, much to the delight of the Phantom. But the Phantom's demands, Raoul's growing attraction and other factors soon begin to play out with disastrous consequences.Andrew Lloyd Weber's ""Phantom of The Opera"" has become one of the most successful musicals of all time. It has played around the world, for extended periods, proving that it touches a large segment of the population. A film would seem inevitable. When someone is so closely identified with a piece of work, it makes sense that they would want to oversee every aspect of the film, to make sure `they got it right'. Weber used his own money to produce the film, presumably so he could retain control of the project.I know many of the fans were hoping Michael Crawford, who originated the role on Broadway, would be cast in the film. I was never able to see Crawford in the role, and saw a much later version in London, with someone I don't even remember. The musical was still fun, mesmerizing and a spectacle to watch. The film is mesmerizing and a spectacle, but not always for the right reasons.Instead, the filmmakers chose Gerard Butler (""Dear Frankie""), a little known Scottish actor for the role. I have seen Butler in a few other films and can recognize that he is actually doing the singing. He does a very good job; his voice has a deep timber that works well with the music. Emmy Rossum is certainly a beautiful young woman and she creates a character who is certainly timid and awed by her first appearance in an opera. However, I didn't think her singing voice was that much different from Carlotta's. Carlotta's voice is supposed to be horrible, ear screeching and embarrassingly bad. Christine's voice is certainly more pretty, but the character is not above trying to reach those high operatic notes which can sound like nails on a chalkboard to many. The voices of the two characters are not different enough to set the characters apart. Her voice is also drowned out in some of the more active areas. If she is singing with almost anyone else, she is almost always drowned out. Patrick Wilson is also very handsome, but again, his voice is not very strong.The acting between the three leads is very close to that of a play. In a play or musical, you have to take certain leaps of faith because you are unable to have scenes which provide insight into a characters thoughts or feelings, unless they are acting or singing these same thoughts. In a film, there are tricks and methods to reveal these things. In the film of ""Phantom"", the filmmaker sticks pretty closely to a theatrical model. Therefore, we have to believe that Raoul and Christine are attracted to each other after remembering they grew up together. They fall in love after singing to each other. Normal dramatic devices are thrown out the window. I think if you can take this leap of faith, you might enjoy the relationship between Christine and Raoul. The relationship between Christine and the Phantom is similar. She is naturally drawn to him as a mentor. But the relationship also has some creepy overtones. At one point, he pretends to be her father. Hello, Mr. Freud? Earlier, he has finished singing a song to her, romancing her, and shows her a wedding dress he has had made for her. A tad creepy. And not creepy in the right way.What doesn't work as well is the relationship between the three characters, the love triangle. Christine's admiration and love seems to flip flop between the two characters depending on whoever is currently singing to her. Naturally, Raoul and the Phantom want to beat the crap out of each other. At one point, as Raoul is about to kill the Phantom, Christine yells out ""No, not like this."" Well, why not? Because if he did kill the Phantom at that point, the story would end and they would liver happily ever after. But the filmmakers can't let that happen, they have about another hour of stuff they want to do, songs they want to sing.The song ""Masquerade"", which provides a key point in the stage production is a good example of what is wrong with the film version. ""Phantom"" is a lot more like the musicals the studios made in the 50s than it wants to be. With the recent releases of  ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Chicago"", it tries to borrow a page from their success, but ends up creating a hodgepodge of a musical mess. ""Moulin Rouge"", which I loved and many hated, used a lot of rapid editing and pop culture songs to tell the story of a doomed relationship in early 20th Century Paris. ""Chicago"" slowed down the editing quite a bit and told a jazzier story. ""Phantom""'s lyrics and style are more like a rock opera but it's sensibilities lie more with films like ""Brigadoon"" or ""Meet Me In St. Louis"". ""Phantom"" desperately wants to be hipper than that, which is why director Joel Schumacher frequently cuts away from the action to weird, out of focus, quick shots. ""Masquerade"" is a good song and could clearly stand on its own. However, it is an old-fashioned musical number. People dance down a large staircase in a highly choreographed manner. Schumacher cuts away from this action to brief, quick shots of other dancers, some of which are out of focus. It's hip. It's young. It's MTV.Schumacher is the other major problem with ""Phantom"". The attention to detail and production design for the film are fantastic. From the opening segment, shot in black and white and created to look like old newsreel footage, to the color sequences in the old opera house, the film is a sight to behold. The black and white segment takes place in the opera house, many years later, when it is in disrepair. As they relight the fabled chandelier, the opera house quickly dusts itself off and we see it in all its grandeur and glory. The scene is magnificent and quickly clues us in to the fact that a lot of money was spent to recreate these sets. As the film progresses, we realize that Schumacher is in love with the production design. No, not in love. He has developed an unhealthy infatuation. Someone should have filed for a restraining order to keep him 100 yards away. As we first follow some characters through the backstage area, Schumacher's camera pans up and down, back and forth, to show us the extent of the set. This is necessary and useful to show us that this world is ""real"". However, he does this exact same movement more than once through the same set. Each time we visit a new area, his camera lingers over every detail. Look at this production design folks. It's brilliant. We get it, Joel. It quickly becomes tiring, repetitive and only serves to draw us out of the action and the world they tried so hard to recreate.Because of all of the excessive shots lingering on various pieces of the set, my boredom in the central relationships and my irritation with some of the singing, I changed the audio on the DVD to the French language track and turned on the English subtitles. You know what? I actually enjoyed the film more. The French singing was a little more beautiful and didn't detract from my experience. But I hardly believe this is what the filmmakers want us to do. Too bad they didn't have different angles on the DVD for me to switch between.If you are a huge fan of the play, you will probably enjoy this film version. If you aren't, skip it. There are far better musicals out there."	3.0	Outstanding Production Design	2005-05-10	10	4	6

How this movie slipped through the Oscar cracks for costuming and design is a mystery, because this DVD is a visual marvel. The music is exquisite as well, there is little to moan about for reproduction. (Exception: Gerard Butler doesn't have much of a voice, but he does convey the damaged Phantom well.)That is the good. The bad is in the casting. As previously stated, Butler is sexy and menacing as a the Phantom, but he seemed to save his opera for300. Newcomer Emmy Rossum has a beautiful voice, but spends most of the time acting waxen and unemotive. The best casting is Minnie Driver, how hams it up hilariously. As Raul, Patrick Wilson fits his part well, but his voice seems boyishly thin. The Phantom should have been able to kick his butt at every turn, but somehow Raul leaves him behind every time, ever angrier.As a result, you are made to focus on the lavishness of the film itself. On that end, it succeeds handily. The Opera House is every bit as stunning as the sets in ""Moulin Rouge!"" and the music is the pure entertaining pop that Andrew Lloyd Weber has made himself rich creating. Colorful and vibrant, with the seediness of the backstage intact. If your looking for spectacle, ""Phantom"" delivers. Just don't expect a lot more."	4.0	Grand Spectacle	2007-09-14	2	1	1

Anyways, I gave the film major points for the visuals. It's fantastic to look at. The sets are beautiful and the costumes are gorgeous. Emmy Rossum is likeable...I didn't hate her. Patrick Wilson I couldn't stand (he just plain irritated me), and the same goes for Gerard Butler (especially when Christine pulled his mask off...all of a sudden he's nearly bald, and half of his entire face is purple and scarred; at least Lon Chaney was genuinely frightening in that version...I didn't sleep for about 4 nights after I saw that). In all honesty, if the film really is an adaption of the stage play...then I don't want to see the play because it's not worth dropping 50 bucks to see it and then not like it (it was bad enough with 10.50). I don't think it's that well written. It wasn't playing to the original story's strengths and it should have. I was really upset to see that The Persian isn't in this, and that the torture chamber is completly cut out (ok not completely...Raoul is there for about half a second, but quickly leaves). I was disappointed because I was hearing only good things about it. Needless to say I'll be avoiding the show like the plague in the future.	3.0	Eh.....	2004-12-26	8	1	7

I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a wonderful 2 hours of great entertainment.  Gerard Butler is SO sexy and handsome, even with half his face distorted.  Why Christine picked Raul over him mistifies me.  Minnie Driver was good as the diva.  Please, if you haven't seen this, GO and rent the DVD and watch.You will not be disappointed!	5.0	WONDERFUL!!!!!!	2005-07-13	2	1	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A35A1AORXGWR5V	TJ	I really have to say that I think this movie is amazing.  While I think the story is painfully dumb (as in the way nobody ever tries to do anything to stop the phantom), the music is spectacular.  I'd choose the movie soundtrack over the original Broadway recording in a second.  Though Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman are technically better singers, I don't think Crawford sounds like a phantom in misery and Emmy Rossum is just so much more pleasant to listen to than Brightman.  So don't trust the pretentious individuals who gave this movie a negative review.  After all, they know so much more about music than you do  ::rolls eyes::.  I could understand how people could be disappointed because they have this preconceived vision of how the phantom should be, but I must say, this production is amazing.	5.0	For the past 3 years these things do happen.	2005-03-13	7	7	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AXAQILJLH5EIF	Toni Shutt	I have long been an avid fan of Phantom of the Opera.  Having seen it on stage, albeit not with Michael Crawford, I didn't think that a movie could do it justice.  There is no comparison to listening to Andrew Lloyd Webbers music in real life.  However, the luscious scenery and costumes were terrific and the music was just as wonderful in film.  The only downfall was that you really need to experience yourself what it is like to watch the giant chandiler being hauled up over the audience.  I have been a great fan of Gerard Butler ever since seeing him in Attila.  He does make a strikingly handsome rough.  I was more than surprised and delighted beyond measure hearing him sing the music to this; so much so that I can't stand to listen to my tapes with Crawford singing it.  Emmy Rossum also is perfect Christine to Butlers hauntingly handsome, and tragic Phantom.  I have discovered that their singing along with Patrick Wilson's who plays Raoul is so much better than what I have heard before.  Minnie Driver is an absolute delight as Carlotta.  I found myself torn between which man I wanted Christine to go with in the end.  But, true to my fantasy of Gerard Butler, his portrayal of the Phantom made me root for him instead.  I just wanted to go through the screen and try and comfort this poor, lonely soul.  A movie you won't regret buying.	5.0	Absolutely Wonderful	2005-05-20	8	7	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1CZKNW6IJFKSG	Tonja	This movie gave me goosebumps, and made me cry...true the singing isn't quite as strong as you might hope, but what are the chances of finding another Sarah Brightman, or Michael Crawford?  And it's not like the singers are bad!  Not even close...they just aren't the original cast, and you can hardly blame them for that! I've been a Phantom affictionato (yeah, well, you try to spell it) for years and have seen some really dreadfull interpretations.  This isn't one of them.  The casting is wonderful, Christine and the phantom both look perfect, and Minnie Driver manages to steal every scene she's in...even though all her singing is dubbed!  The costumes and sets are lavish and the music is all faithfully reproduced, along with almost all the dialogue. As an added bonus, just about everything in the movie that's not in the broadway musical was taken directly from the book! That never happens! There are a few sticky points (like the timing of the chandalier) but for the most part it's as close to perfection as you can get.	5.0	not perfect...but close	2005-05-11	12	6	6

So when the dvd released I was in much doubt of a new Phantom. I have to say that I was totally mesmerized by Gerard Butler's performance of the Phantom! He brings so much heart and emotion into his performance. As he sings to Christine you can't help but fall in love with his voice and his character. I'm sure all of us girls would love to have someone make us feel the way Christine must have felt! I found myself feeling so sad for the Phantom, as his love is so desperate and Christine betrays him. Emmy Rossum did an amazing job as well, her voice is beautiful. In the point of no return scene you could truly feel her desire and pure emotion in the song. Definetly the most romantic and sexy song in the movie, Gerard Butler's presence and voice is overwhelmingly intoxicating. Girls, if you are looking for a movie to get emotionally involved with this is it. I've watched it 6 times already and still think it's amazing. I look forward to seeing this young cast in future films. Hopefully we'll be seeing alot more of Gerard Butler as the new James Bond, what can I say, he's incredibly sexy!!	5.0	The Most Romantic Movie	2005-05-07	4	3	1

Many similarities in sets and sequences to the original stage play. It is still a bit stagey, but it has been opened up a bit.

However, as a musician, I am somewhat familiar with the songs associated with Webber's masterpiece.  This film version simply did not cut the mustard.  Here's why:The Phantom is all wrong.  I thought The Phantom was supposed to have an absolutely amazing voice.  Where was it in this movie?  Nonexistent.  Butler is out of his league when it comes to singing these songs, whatever qualifications he may have brought to the table.  Seriously, who did he sleep with to get cast in this role?  The actor that plays Raol out-sings him, and that is an atrocity.  The Phantom is also wrong in this movie because you like him too much.  His ""creepy-factor"" is not nearly high enough.  He's too nice, too handsome, not nearly menacing enough.  From my understanding, you are supposed to feel sorry for this pituful creature that happens to have a really bad temper.  Plus, we see far too much of The Phantom.  Couldn't Schumacher have played with the lighting better to obscure our view of him?Next issue, the actress playing Christine.  What a beautiful girl.  Nice voice, but far from spectacular.  I thought she looked bored most of the movie, like she was going to fall asleep standing-up!Minnie Driver managed to do a nice job playing the diva Carlotta.  Even though it is not her singing voice, she made the most of this obviously over-the-top character.  Well-played.Raol.  Wow, he hardly got any screen time, but when he did, I found myself asking, ""Why isn't he The Phantom?"" because his voice is SO much better than Butler's.  Also, isn't Christine supposed to be torn between The Phantom and Raol?  I got no sense of conflict.  There was a total lack of this love triangle.  Plus, we have no reason to like this character.  Tragic lack of character development.The sets were really well-done.  Costumes get an ""A"".  Editing was awful.  Chop, chop, choppy!Overall, I think the movie was destined for failure from the beginning.  The only thing I could compare it to would be trying to re-write The Bible: you just DON'T DO IT."	2.0	I tried to keep an open mind.	2005-05-11	19	7	12

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A385GX0LP1QSKG	"tudortwo ""twodoor2"""	"I just loved this movie for it invoked romance and sexual tension that I haven't seen in a movie in years.  Gerard Butler (he looks like he stepped off the cover of a romance novel) has got to be the sexiest man alive. The reason I subtract one star is because no woman on earth would dare have us believe she would choose Raoul over the Phantom.  I almost died when I saw the ""Point of No Return.""  I think they had to hose down the set after that smoldering scene.  It is just hard to believe that Christine would leave the Phantom for a man who has the sex appeal of a tree.  But then I again, I suppose it's a movie, and the fairytale would not be acceptable if she ended up with the supposedly ""deformed"" man.The music is full of emotion, and I enjoyed the singing performances more than the Brightman/Crawford duo.  I think Emmy Rossum has a more pure and distinct voice than Brightman. Butler has the tragic tension (and loads of testosterone) that Crawford didn't quite convey to me.  I've seen the production on stage, and the movie is so much better.  You also don't have to pay $100 each time you watch it.  The sets are beautiful, and you can fast forward all the parts with Raoul singing to her in his feminine voice how he's going to protect her - PAH-LEESE!!.  He was so annoying.  Patrick Wilson (Raoul) is a talented singer, but he emerges with poor acting skills for a movie production, and we never feel the attraction between himself and Christine.  It's almost like she's with him because he has money and a title and she's a giddy teenager eager for the good life.As a side note, I've read the original novel from 1911, and it is one of the most romantic and emotional books.  I think Webber really tried to bring that raw emotion into his musical.  I just wish that Christine would end up with the Phantom and Raoul would end up with a bad hair day, can we have an alternate ending Mr. Webber, PLEASE??!!!"	4.0	Goosebumps!!	2005-06-07	4	1	3

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a fairly close film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's famous musical by the same name. The movie opens in a black and white, reminiscent of an old movie newsreel. It's 1919 and the Paris Opera House is dilapidated. Items from opera poster to music boxes to the famed chandelier are being auctioned off. As the chandelier rises for the bidders to see, the theatre is restored to its magnificent and colorful glory and the audience is transported in time to 1871. The story goes something like this. A young orphaned girl, Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum), is raised in the opera house. In her dreams she is taught music lesson by what she believes is the Angel of Music that her dying father promised he would send to her. In reality, her teacher is the Opera's infamous Phantom, a man seldom seen but whose presence is always felt and known. The Phantom (Gerard Butler) has been tutoring Christine not only so that she can one day become the opera's star, but also so that she will one day become his wife. The Phantom has a physical deformity that (in this version) that has horribly scarred half his face. Things start off well and Christine finally gets her big moment to shine. But then her old boyfriend shows up and things escalate from there. The Phantom is torn by rage and the two-faced nature of his soul, represented by his disfigured face, causes lots of havoc. But things have a mostly happy ending.The movie follows the plot of the musical it's based on fairly well. There are some minor changes in plot done for more dramatic effect, but overall the story structure is the same. The costumes and set design of the film are magnificent and the acting is superb. Rossum looks like Christine and she sings well. Actually, most of the singing in the movie is good.However, there are a few things that I felt distracted from the overall flow of the film. Gerard Butler is a great actor and has a nice voice. However, his voice just isn't right for The Phantom. At times I think it sounds too high and other times it sounds too low. It's not that he doesn't sing well, because he does. However, his vocal talents just weren't adapted well to capture the physical passion and spiritual torture that embodies every syllable The Phantom speaks (or in this case, sings). Also, Butler looks almost the same age as Rossum. The Phantom is someone twice Christine's age and in the movie he looks like a big brother instead of the elder tutor and father-figure he's supposed to be.Also, only part of the Phantom's face is disfigured. Actually, it's about 1/4th of his face. For the duality approach that the film seems to be going for it would have been nice to see at least a full 1/2 of his face scarred. However, what the filmmakers did does fit because in the end the Phantom does the right thing. It's just that through most of the film there's this whole two-faced, dual nature motif going on and the face is a huge part of that. I think if exactly 1/2 his face was scarred it would have made The Phantom's final act even more poignant.In the movie, most of the singing between Christine and Raoul has been reduced to dialogue. I'm not sure about the reasoning behind this. Patrick Wilson (Raoul) seemed to be a decent enough singer and should have been able to handle the vocal challenges. Perhaps it was done to appeal to a wider audience. Who knows?Finally, there is the Masquerade scene. The attendees are mostly dressed in black and white costumes with the occasional dash of gold. The Phantom makes his appearance in a Masque of the Red Death costume, but other than that there isn't much color. Masquerades are usually colorful and it would have been nice to see some of that color during that scene.There are several allusions in the movie to other Webber works and to the original PHANTOM OF THE OPERA novel by Gaston Leroux. For instance, the horse that the Phantom places Christine on is an allusion to a scene in the novel that is almost identical and when the theatre owners are told to &#34;grovel, grovel&#34; the music and lyrics are almost identical to a piece in JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR DREAMCOAT (another Webber musical).Overall, PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a delight to watch. Joel Schumacher often messes things up when he directs, but for once he got things right and made a film that though full of excess, is also beautiful and meaningful.	4.0	Think of Me	2005-01-25	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2IU2BSVWQLKJ7	Unlucky Frank	My last girlfriend played the Original London Cast soundtrack incessantly in our living room. I saw the play twice. Once with Crawford and once with Guillaume. I thought it was okay for a broadway musical and even though I knew a lot of the words by heart, I always thought her obsession for THE PHANTOM was a bit extreme. But, nothing would prepare me for the emotional impact of seeing this musical brought to the screen. It knocked me out BIG TIME. This film is emotional dynamite. Especially the roof scene and the ending.I think the reason so many fans of THE PHANTOM say they like the movie better is that film is a very visual and personal medium. The space and remoteness of a stage is completely done away with when a musical is brought to the widescreen. We get to share in the actors emotional reactions to the singing that they project. I was raised on MGM musicals and have always preferred them to stage musicals. Even though some of the excitement of the LIVE event is lost while viewing a film. This is not the case with the film version of THE PHANTOM. It's BREATHTAKING to say the least. I was also able to understand almost every word in the film version, while I only understood about 2 thirds of the vocal articulation of the stage play. And unlike the play, I was completely MOVED the first, second, and third viewing of the film. And now I'm just as obsessed with PHANTOM as my girlfriend was. OH, GOD!! I'M GAY!!This has now become my second favorite film musical following WEST SIDE STORY, while knocking SINGING IN THE RAIN into a distance third place. THIS FILM IS THAT GOOD!! It's so lavish and beautiful to look at, I'm completely at a loss as to why it didn't win Best Picture, let alone to not even be nominated for it. PLEASE!! This was hands down the BEST FILM OF 2004. If Mr. Peabody sent us back to the 40'S, 50's, or 60's in his Wayback Machine when musicals were beloved, this film would have captured at least some of the 10 Oscars that went to WEST SIDE STORY in 1960. It's just as moving as that film. And unlike those old Marny Nixon dubbed vocal days, almost all of the cast do their own singing. Amazing!! MILLION DOLLAR BABY is a great film, but this is an INSTANT CLASSIC!! In ten years time, most people will have forgotten that film, but I'm sure I'll be viewing THIS every Sunday night, (which is now WEST SIDE STORY night in my house,) for years to come. Man, Hollywood sure has changed.In one of the Documentary Features on the 2 Disc DVD, Andrew Lloyd Webber stated that this was the way he always envisioned his PHANTOM. I agree!! He must be stoked!!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1H5E7O5BW2J13	V.C.	"I feel very glad that i had seen Phantom of the Opera on Broadway twice in my lifetime. Seeing Phantom on stage is a wonderful experience: the scenery, the theatrics, the music, the singing, the acting, the emotion, and the heart and character that makes this musical very moving and affective. And yes, the movie does capture the scenery and theatrical aspect of the show very well. But the main problem is the lack of emotion in the music, the singing, the acting, the emotion, and the heart and soul of the play. First of all, the soundtrack for this movie sounds very wooden, and it doesn't make a big bang on songs like ""Phantom of the Opera"" and ""The Music of the Night"" as it did originally. The acting: so, so. I just thought at times that there was not enough acting involved to actually make you connect with the characters. At times the roles of the main characters (including the Phantom himself) was cringing and dull to the point where i wished that the movie was going to end! The main problem i have about this film is the way the phantom is portrayed: handsome and charming, with porcelain skin, a flawless body, and very nice hair. Now, is this the type of phantom that we are expected to believe is conniving, grotesque, and hideous? I mean seriously, at times i thought he was Zoro or Ben Affleck. Even when the mask is revealed you question what the big fuss is about. What was supposed to be a monster looking creature was instead a suave actor that had a bad hair day and a bad rash and sun burn. One word: LAME. It's just disappointing. Not only was it distracting, but it was simply annoying. At that point you feel less intimidated by the phantom, and feel less and less convinced that this phantom is worth the screams that the characters give in his presence. I can go on and on about the flaws of this film really. The only good qualities about this film is the look of the film, it's well done and doesn't look cheap or overdone. But what it does well on the glammor of the costumes and stage setting is horribly lacking or missing on what should really matter: the emotion."	3.0	High Expectations, Expectations Not Delivered	2005-06-02	8	4	4

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A37RDILC9JXTON	Victoria M. Aylward	Schumacher's Phantom is a beautiful lush extravegant interpretation of Andrew Lloyd Weber's show.  The scenery and costumes are spectacular, as is the music, of course.  Emmy Rossum is fantastic as Christine.  Gerard Butler makes you sympathetic to the Phantom, and for an untrained singer, he nails the songs beautifully.  Patrick Wilson is charmeing as Raoul.  The other supporting players entertain and some, such as Simon Callow and Cyrn HInds, provide comic relief to a production that could otherwise come across as campy.The bonus material is very entertaining and informative.  Cast and crew from the original stage production in London, are interviewed.  Then there is behind the scenes footage from the film, with interviews and insight into how the film was made.

This is about a man who has been abandoned, unloved and abused. In the process he became bitter and angry. This changed who he was and turned him to a beast (Not because of his looks). The so call love he had for her was more like bondage than real love. The light shined on this when she finally saw what real love was.

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3AEWUVYMELPNG	V. Koehler	"Like so many other fans I had seen the stage play of this musical when it first came out and loved it. However when I saw the movie version it totally blew me away. The whole cast is outstanding allowing the seamless telling of the story.  This movie moves you both deeply and profoundly and those feelings remain with you long after the movie is over. It is Gerard Butler's magnificent performance as the Phantom that accomplishes this. He is all at once dark, dangerous, sensuous, sexy, tortured, tormented and oh so human. His singing so full of raw emotion and passion moves my very soul and is not to be missed. The music through out the whole movie is lush and powerful and stays with you so you may wish to order the soundtrack when you get the movie. Though do keep in mind that this is a very tragic story of great love and loss, betrayal of that love and of sacrifice for that love, so do keep a box of kleenex handy. Make that a large box of kleenex if you relate to the Phantoms' heartbreak and pain, which I think is a given based on Gerard Butler's amazing potrayal of the Phantom. I still cry every time I watch this movie and I am well on my way to triple digits for the number of times I have watched it and to me it is still just as magnificent and haunting as the very first time I saw it. I would buy the 2 disc special widescreen edition if for no other reason than the deleted scene ""No One Would Listen"" it is as beautiful as it is sad."	5.0	Phantom of the Opera is both magnificent and haunting	2009-01-25	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A16P5N8MNTXXU3	"V. R. Hutter ""v_rh"""	Prior to buying the DVD I had seen Phantom in live theatre.  I was not prepared for what I experienced with this movie--why it didn't sweep the Academy Awards in 2004 I'll never know.  It is a magnificent production and I think even better than the stage version. I am frequently disappointed with movies since it is difficult for film to do justice to a book or classic, but that is not the case with Phantom.  Beautiful music, an absolutely fantastic cast, great direction and screen writing, editing, beautiful costumes, make-up, set design, cinematology, and sets--it has it all.  I was immediately swept up with the poignant story and must admit I was rooting with tears in my eyes for Christine to stay with the Phantom and bring love and beauty into his life. Just as an aside, I think it was brilliant making the phantom's face a genetic anomalie rather than Hollywood's usual horror-show monster.  You could understand the loneliness, rejection and isolation of the phantom and his desire for love and acceptance by the beautiful Christine.  Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy and now this production of Phantom of the Opera are my absolute favorite movies of all times.  I was mesmerized by this film--this is the quinessential phantom of the opera and will be the production against which all productions will be compared.  Think of The King and I and you think of Yul Brenner--indeed it is hard to imagine a production of The King and I which is not Yul Brenner in the lead.  This production will be the same to Phantom of the Opera.  It is a classic and I plan to view it again and again--I don't think it could have been done better!  This film is a must-see and is a keeper--as far as I am concerned it is the definitive Phantom of the Opera!

Waxstein ""wax27stein"""	"I saw both the New York and San Francisco productions of The Phantom of the Opera and personally did not care for the play but loved the music. The film was a completely different experience! My daughters and I have been back to see the movie twice, plan to see it a third time, and buy the DVD.Previous reviews have already described the visual delights of the film, excellent performances of cast members (Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson, Minnie Driver, etc), the incredible sound track, gorgeous sets, breathtaking cinematography, and magnificent choreography of the dance numbers.Gerard Butler is WHOW!!!!!!! Gerard Butler's performance as the Phantom affected us deeply, emotionally altered the audience, and has been very under rated. Michael Crawford with his incredible voice did not send patrons from the Theatre in tears, broken hearted, or rushing to web sites to down load his picture!!!Frankly only an innocent sixteen year old waking up, in the PHANTOM'S lair, with Gerard Butler sitting at an Organ, and the lyrics of ""Music of the Night"" playing in your head would have gone for the mask!!! My Gosh, the rest of the audience wanted to ""Touch him, trust him, savor each sensation, and let dreams begin!!!!! Finally the lyrics of the movie made sense!!! To ""drop all defenses, completely succumbed to"" Gerard or leave with Patrick????Gerard Butler's Phantom is sexy, tender, masculine, protective, and human. An isolated man who has fallen in love with the only human he has had a relationship with over the years. Hoping that his gift of music will over shadow his deformity and he might find love with Christine. He becomes impossibly jealous and distraught when it looks as though he might loose her to another. You feel his desperation, his longing, loneliness, and pain. It broke our hearts. Gerard Butler's singing was great, complemented his performance, and I appreciated the masculine voice!I was deeply moved by this movie, anguished over the Phantoms fate, and have thought often about it. The audience applauded after each showing, shouted out comments, and most left in tears. The film was exceptional."	5.0	Wonderful, Beautiful.  Must see movie!	2004-12-29	5	5	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2ORU2HV0YBL8Y	Wade Burchette	I've seen Andrew Lloyd Webber's Broadway production and traveling production of this play.  The movie holds true to both and actually makes the play easier to understand.  The storyline is strong, the music well done, and the acting superb.  Even though this is a love story, this isn't a chick flick.  I thoroughly appreciated it.  And you will too.Oh, and the video quality is second to none.  I compared this version with the version that came on HBO HD, and the picture was superior on the HD DVD.  It was a clear-cut improvement, but the edges were more well-defined on the HD DVD version.  The sound quality is also superior.  A big bonus when you consider all the singing going on.	5.0	Holds true to the Broadway musical	2007-08-28	3	3	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1C80B497LCYKA	"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark"""	"First, you have to like musicals. Second, you have to like the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber. Third, you have to understand that a movie is a different animal from a stage play. And fourth, you have to be open to a different, younger interpretation of the story than the stage version. If you accept those four conditions, you will love this film.The two-disc special edition is well worth the extra money. There are two extensive features: one tells the story of how the stage musical came to be; the second, how the film originated and developed. If you ever had a question about either the play or the film, they're answered here.In taking Phantom from stage to screen - making it the most expensive independent film in history - Webber increased his orchestra to over 100 pieces. So the music has never sounded better, making the CD equally necessary for the Phantom fan. In addition, he wanted to use a rock-and-roll voice for the Phantom, rather than a trained voice like Michael Crawford - thus, the choice of Gerard Butler (Dear Frankie, Beowulf and Grendel) for the role. This is probably the stickiest point for Phantom fans that expected the rich tones of a Crawford or Hart. But Butler does an admirable job. My only complaint is that he is so covered up with mask, wig, makeup and costume that there is very little of Butler left to look at. If you've seen him in other films, he has a strong masculine look. So you get little more than his voice. But even with those restrictions, he creates an emotionally appealing Phantom.It was director Joel Schumacher's (Batman Forever, Phone Booth, The Lost Boys) idea to give Phantom a younger cast and look, so that it would appeal to younger audiences. Part of his justification was that Christine is so nave and innocent, how could she not be younger. Emmy Rossum (The Day After Tomorrow, An American Rhapsody) fills the role perfectly, with a beautifully mesmerizing face and equally beautiful voice - though not with the vocal strength of a Sarah Brightman, for whom Webber wrote the role as a testament to his love. Patrick Wilson (Oklahoma on Broadway, The Alamo), as Raoul, fills out the three main principals, and is probably the most solid of the group, both dramatically and vocally, though his role is the smallest.The supporting cast is equally stunning, headed by Miranda Richardson as a compelling Madam Giry; Minnie Driver as a delightfully self-obsessed Carlotta (dubbed vocally by Margaret Preece - except for the final, hauntingly beautiful credits song, ""Learn To Be Lonely,"" which was nominated for an Oscar); Ciaran Hinds as flamboyant opera owner Firmin; Simon Callow as Andre his partner; Jennifer Ellison as winsome Meg Giry; and Kevin McNally as devious Buquet.The production design by Anthony Pratt (2001: A Space Odyssey) is exquisitely colorful - certainly romantic, but not gothic or scary enough for many Phantom fans, even though it was nominated for an Oscar. The cinematography by John Mathieson (Gladiator) was also nominated, and is breathtaking, for the most part, with many standouts, including the ""Overture,"" the transition in ""Think of Me,"" ""Prima Donna,"" ""All I Ask of You"" (rooftop scene), and the chandelier crash; as well as the grainy black-and-white sequences. My favorite is the shot at the end of ""Prima Donna,"" in which the camera cranes back from the stage, through the curtain and into the house, with the curtain closing behind it. That shot was masterful, and one of the finest in film history, in my opinion.It is no easy task bringing a stage musical to the screen. They rarely succeed. Most successful movie musicals (e.g., Sound Of Music, Singin' In The Rain, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers, An American In Paris) were written for the screen. There are exceptions: My Fair Lady and West Side Story; but it's always a gamble. In spite of the critics, I think Phantom is one of the better ones.

It is definately worth it.Emmy, Gerard, and Patrick are amazing as the leads, they give passion and emotion to the timeless story, which i feel the stage version was lacking. Sarah Brighton is amazing, but is all wrong for Christine. Emmy brings the emotion and innocence to Christine, portraying her love for Raoul and desire for the Phantom. Gerard is a more rogue-ish Phantom, and gives the Phantom a backbone that Micheal Crawford lacked. He brings a sexual desire to the Phantom, which is what is intended in the ALW version and Susan Kay's ""Phantom.""This movie is defiantely a feast for the eyes and was completely robbed for the Oscars. The acting is wonderful and the cast is extremely talented! Just listening to the soundtrack gives me chills and I can't wait to enjoy the movie again.Plus, the only reason it is being released so early, is that is was a limited release, showing that Hollywood did not expect it to be as successful and beloved as it truly was.

I have never seen the stage performance and would be hesitant now because after watching this lush, romantic, passionate, stirring rendition I am afraid the stage production would be a letdown.  The melodies haunt me long after the viewing has ended.  I think the casting was brilliant.  The dark, magnetic pull between the Phantom and Christine is believable and strums every romantic string my heart possesses.

The scenery, the costumes, everything is so lush and they seemed to have every detail in order.  It was a very well formed and skilled cast and a large one at that.  I must confess, I bought the movie after I saw Gerard Butler was the phantom, and I was very impressed with his performance.  I just couldn't pass up a chance to hear Leonidas singing. :)I must say it was a bit slow going for me at first, beautiful, but slow.  But, in the end, I'm glad I made that journey with the characters.  A few times during this film I remember saying to myself, ""Alright already, I get it!  Can we just move on please?""  Some of the scenes were a bit long, like the cemetery scene; I wanted Christine to get to where she was going already!  She had a very long song to sing!  And they must have repeated the line ""The Angel of Music"", referring to the phantom, at least 100 times throughout the movie, that got a bit old.But, like I said, the long journey to the climax was worth every bit of patience.  At first, I was routing for the phantom; he had gone out of his way to coach this girl and wanted to make her a star.  So, when this rich boy comes along and only notices Christine after she has the lead role, the role the phantom helped her get, I was a bit skeptical of the boy.But, when the phantom kills one of the stage crew, for no real reason, that's when my opinion of him started to change.  It broke my heart, though, when Christine was with the rich boy on the roof, telling him how ugly the phantom was and how she couldn't imagine a life with him.  At that point, I didn't think much of Christine, felt sorry for the phantom, and continued to dislike the rich boy.It wasn't until the Masquerade scene that all those opinions changed.  Christine and the rich boy were secretly engaged and attend the ball together.  The scorned phantom makes an appearance and by that time, he was starting to appear as an obsessive stalker and I felt a little scared for Christine.  And the way the rich boy chases after him to provide some relief for his fianc&eacute;, I thought that was noble of him.At one point, before Christine is about to star in the phantom's opera ""Don Juan"", I remember Christine telling her rich boy how frightened she was to lure the phantom into the trap they had set.  It was then that I had the revelation ~ why don't they just leave that freaking opera house?  There are other places and opera houses in the world without stalker phantoms in them... But I guess that wouldn't make much of a movie...  Anyways...Oh, and the background story of how the phantom came to be in the opera house really helped me to understand the phantom so much more.  The horrible cruelty one had to suffer from being different back in those times.  It was truly sad.  Then the young ballerina teacher hides him in the opera house after he attacks his abuser, and he grows up getting to know everything about the opera house.  Um, and why didn't the ballerina teacher and the phantom ever hook up?The climax was a great one; Christine betrays the phantom by pulling off his mask.  And let me just say wow at what was hidden under that mask.  Wow!  Before the big reveal, I never thought it could be that bad, I mean, the other half of his face was, well hot, and the mask seemed to cover so little!  I kept asking myself what is wrong with that Christine girl earlier in the movie; this is Gerard Butler were talking about!  But wow, when the mask is pulled off and all is revealed, it's hard to imagine the handsome face under that!  Well done make-up artists!But I digress...  The scene back in the phantom's lair, when the phantom is overcome with possessive jealousy, forcing poor Christine to be at his side when her heart clearly belongs to the rich boy, it was heartbreaking.  The phantom's slip into madness was an understandable, but scary change.  And when the phantom makes her choose a life with him or a world without her rich boy, it was tragic.  Realizing what he had become in the eyes of the woman he loved, the phantom relents and lets them go.  And when Christine goes to say her goodbye to the phantom, it makes for the saddest scene of the entire film for me.  He had so much love for her and when he broke down and reveals his true self, she just leaves.  She just leaves with her rich boy.  My goodness it was sad.Great movie it is one I'm very happy to have as apart of my collection.  Well done to all the people involved with this film; it is truly great."	5.0	A Worthwhile Journey	2011-08-22	3	3	0

Yes, this is a musical but it's a motion picture and a story first. Music without the backing of the intrigue and the ambiguity of the story plot is just beautiful and powerful music. But together - WOW.Andrew Lloyd Webber waited many years to make this film. The stage musical had to play out first. But this version is worth it's ""wait in gold."" They did change the plot however, instead of the story being that of a lecherous middle aged deformed man (The Phantom) this film version has become almost a m&eacute;nage a trios with the girl, Christine (played by Emmy Rossum) torn between two lovers. The exciting phantom, (played by Gerard Butler) and the very bland Viscount played by Patrick Wilson.The Phantom is a player in the hearts of women. He is tall, dark and hansom, until he takes his mask off that is. But still, if Christine hadn't found him out to be just a pathetique deformed man with human frailties, he may have won her over.Gerard Butler is not a great singer but he can put a song across in a tantalizing and passionate way. The scene where he first takes Christine into his watery cave is mesmerizing."	4.0	Fine Phantom Film	2005-09-26	3	2	1

I loved seeing this film partly because I was never able to attend the stage performance so it was great to see it in action.I loved this film because it struck my chords of emotion, empathy, and anticipation not just irritating song after smiling song. I hate musicals and this is NOT a mere musical, it is a work of art. The colors, the actors, the sets, the story. Nothing was overdone. Gerard Butler was great as the phantom letting the audience see the sinister and the sympathetic without giving too much.However his voice, while speaking is rich, but I can't say I cared for his singing much except the DON JUAN performance. As an experienced musician with a good ear, I say Emmy Rossum was great I don't know why people are dogging her so! And last but not least, Minnie Driver did an excellent job as the Diva Carlotta, she was just out of control.Okay I don't have any other words to describe how much I enjoyed this film ( I cried at the end and I usually don't cry over movies).

Unfortunately for anyone who has had the opportunity to see the stage production, it pales in comparison. But in reality, no one can fairly compare the stage and the screen. Both are extremely different avenues. I felt that the movie accurately portrayed the storyline. The actors were extremely well chosen for their respective roles. The only thing that I disliked, however, was the singing voice of Gerard Butler as the Phantom. Although he captured the magic of ""The Music of the Night"" well, the rest of the songs were a bit lacking vocally on his part. His voice was excellent, to say the very least. However, part of the essence of the Phantom character is to have a large, powerful, booming, and mysterious voice. It is meant to make you shudder and be fearful of him. I don't feel like this actor's voice created that emotion in the movie. Again, it was a superb film!"	4.0	Overall, good film	2005-05-08	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A173B3M8WJ9WZI	"Wilum Hopfrog Pugmire, Esq. ""H. P. Lovecraft ..."	"I saw a stage production here in Seattle about ten years ago and it amazed me.  For the past fortnight I've been watching the 25th Anniversary telecast on PBS, and this led to my becoming truly obsessed with this musical.  Thus I have order two copies of the movie here at Amazon, plus the two-disc soundtrack, and I am leaning on ordering the Original London Cast cd.I was instantly captivated by this film, and I think it is an excellent cinematic interpretation of the stage play.  All of the acting is superb, especially Gerard Butler and Minnie Driver.  Butler's singing leaves a bit to be desired, but I was not aware of that as I watched the film, being so utterly captivated by his film persona, his beauty and his powerful performance.  His beauty is, of course, questionable in this role;  yet he makes the Phantom a monster in action if not entirely in appearance.The finest aspect of the film is that we hear the score with a film orchestra, and thus, for me, the music is enhanced in beauty and magnificence.  The changes from the stage production work extremely well.  A cinematic version should not be a duplicate of a stage production -- they are entirely different mediums.The film is powerful and imaginative, an excellent rendition of a romantic classic.  The music, written by a man in love for the woman of his dreams, captures the essence of romance.  I love this film and will be watching it again tonight.  And perhaps tomorrow night as well.  The only ""defect"" is that the disc won't play on my laptop DVD player, and I would love to experience the entire film really loud on headphones,in deep darkness with just the images of the film before me."	5.0	Haunting	2012-03-14	1	1	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1SPB225CVTRUU	"Wing Lee ""filmfan"""	Finally, the most popular musical is made into a feature film! I was so thrilled to see it, because I had to sing some of the songs in the choir in high school, but never got to see it on broadway.My knowledge of the story was vague at the time, but I certainly loved the music, and the songs include The Music of The Night, Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again, and The Point of No Return.This is by far the most visually stunning film I've seen this year, and they have done a great deal of work on the sets and costumes. So it's no doubt an eye candy. The music and the performances were absolutely dazzling. I didn't find a single moment in this film to be boring.Miranda Richardson gives another marvellous supporting performance as Madame Giry, who rescued The Phantom when he was in captivity as a young boy, and ever since he lived underground. She eventually send Christine to meet him, and secretly learn to sing under his guidance. And when the time came for the replacement of Carlotta's leading role in the opera house, Christine was the perfect choice. She was able to steal scenes with her French accent and the way she uses her eyes that ultimately stood out in group scenes.Minnie Driver plays Carlotta, a super-snob diva with a bizzare Italian accent, and she is more glamorous than she was in Beautiful. She gets to sing off key in a tightly cinched corset, and she was the comic relief in this film. After 5 seasons as a lead, she was bound to be replaced by the more talented and well-trained and unknown Christine. She actually just lipsyned the songs and it was dubbed by a professional opera singer named Margaret Preece.Emmy Rossum is wonderful as Christine, and she's stunning when she gets to perform Think Of Me on stage. Althogh she's unknown to mainstream audiences, but she had previously done a wonderful supporting role in Songcatcher. She's torn between her longtime boyfriend Raoul, played by Patrick Wilson and The Phantom. She's grateful for The Phantom for teaching her to become a great singer, but her heart belongs to Raoul. The Phantom loves her, and wants her to leave Raoul, or else....Gerard Butler's role slowly intensifies and he's broken hearted when Christine chose to leave him, depite the fact that he would cause a disaster to the opera house. There's a great deal of chemistry between Rossum and him, but he has less screen time compared to her. I am totally sympathetic towards his character, because the world treated him like a monster, simply for his distorted face. I was thought if they didn't cast Butler, they could definitely cast Antonio Banderas.Patrick Wilson is also great as Raoul who ultimately takes Christine home. I didn't like his character, and I thought that The Phantom should have killed him even if Christine didn't want to stay.As a musical film, I honestly think it's better than Moulin Rouge and Chicago, even though it doesn't have superstars like Nicole Kidman or Renne Zellwegger to carry it. I equally enjoyed Andrew Lloyd Webber's film version of Evita(Madonna).	5.0	Surrender yourself to the music, elaborate sets, and cast!	2004-12-23	10	9	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3KH10L4KZXZSU	Winston Bunkerbooken	"As I walked up to the theatre in my small town, I worried. I worried that Joel Schumaker was going to give us an ugly, high-tech flick like Batman and Robin. That the actors would not be able to act and sing at the same time. I also dreaded that this would be turned into a cheesy comedy instead of a gothic melodrama. As I *left* the theatre, I realized this was the best motion picture I had ever seen. Below I will give a few details on the way the film is perfected.The Phantom is a mysterious, tragic character that feels that he has been removed from humanity and is now a demon, a monster. Gerard Butler brought this intensity to his role in both singing and speaking.His singing is a bass/tenor voice, that expresses his character perfectly, unlike Michael Crawford who went over-the- top with his soprano voice.Crawford does have a smoother voice, but his seduction level is about 0, as seen in his Music of the Night video. Emmy Rossum is the singer I am the most impressed with. She has a pure beauty to her that has been lost with the rise of cosmetics. When she is scared or sad, her tears come from her eyes, not onions.Sarah Brightman was too squeaky in her singing, and unable to understand.Sarah might have more experience, but her acting is extremely mediocre. Minnie Driver really gave a great performance as La Carlatta Guidecelli, who is an overloud opera diva. Though she didn't sing her part, unlike everyone else, she does sing the beautiful song at the end of the film. Many have complained about her being over-the-top, but whoever paid good money to see under the top? Miranda Richardson is a somewhat shadowy character. Since I saw her playing an evil stepmother in another spectacular film(Sleepy Hollow) I have guessed that she is a truly evil character and that the Phantom is a puppet on her strings...but she isn't.Alexandra Byrne, you are an absolute genius. You know what the character should be feeling at certain parts of the film. When Christine sings""Think Of Me"" you dressed her in a sparkly, white dress. When she is at the cemetery, you gave her a black cloak and dress with red trimmings.The men's costumes also bring out their feelings, even though they're not as complex.And the sheer number of costumes to be made was, by itself, a challenge, though she tackled it!Tony Pratt's art direction in this film is the best I've seen since Titanic. It isn't all morbid nor all bright. There are mixtures of both sometimes.We are supposed to be in Paris in 1870 but it seems we are in a time that never even existed. The stage, also, has never looked so beautiful.Nudes adorn all of the poles and pillars, and also keep an eye out for the hidden skulls in the architecture! Keep a sharp eye and notice how a lot of them have their eyes covered! The best set had to be the cemetery. It seems to expand endlessly with its humongous statues, graves, masoleums, and trees!Cinematography...brilliant. The use of color is sometimes very vague, as in the cemetery scene, to show the deadness of the shot and the sorrow of the characters.In the masquerade scene, we are given many shades of color to accompany the wonderful music, and not just in two or three angles, but in twenty, though there is a certain color code so that when the Phantom arrives in his blood-red outfit, it somehow stains the screen!Joel, you have brought yourself out of the B-movie hole that you fell into back in 1997.You calmed down and made a beautiful, tear-jerking story. The hatred, love, sorrow, and inner beauty that Gaston Leroux published in his book in 1910 are brought out to the farthest reaches. Stick with these kind of films, and you might become like James Cameron, a recognized director, who had been overlooked for many years.In conclusion, this film is very beautiful. The story is well-written, the music is unforgettable, and the actors are compelling.The sound on the dVD really blows you away, especially if you have a surround sound system. The picture is preserved to its grandiose 2:40 Widescreen ratio.DO NOT GET FULLSCREEN!You miss 66% of the film. The second disc also has very interesting special features!

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AP9M8N0LRSIPL	Wiscman	"I would have preferred a filmed version of the play, but making a movie does allow for real special effects.  But, I want to focus on the music.  The music is what holds the story together, I believe.  The score and the lyrics are the essence of the entire story.  In spite of there not being a full orchestra in the play, there were organs and synthesizers to round out the sound.  The film version seems thinner - in spite of a full orchestra, and the play seemed richer because of the greater variety of instruments.  Listening to the two soundtracks actually lead me to believe that the play had the larger orchestra.The singing was good.  Other than the small percentage of theater-goers who actually got to see Brightman and Crawford, there were many different Phantoms and Cristines around the world.  Yes, every Phantom can be compared to Crawford.  Crawford had a timbre in his voice that could not be matched by anyone else.  In the movie, I don't believe they even tried.  They found a very competent singer who had a stage ""presence"" which overcame any of his singing shortcomings.  I found him far more effective as the Phantom.The second disk was great.  It allowed an insight into the struggles to put together a play according to Andrew's vision - after he had read the original book.  Things like the songs and music constantly evolving over the years of stage performances was an insight I would not have known.  I had only seen the play twice in Boston at fairly close intervals.The play stayed with me since that time.  It is haunting and ethereal.  It is dramatic and sad.  The film helps me relive the stage performance."	5.0	Excellent expansion of the play.	2005-06-07	6	3	3
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A188NTJ5LV8LA4	Wm19	I watched the Phantom of the Opera theatre production 13 years ago, and quickly ran out to get the Original London Cast recording.  When I watched this movie, I was just swept away.  The movie was excellent, the music was right on, the costumes and scenary were beautiful, and the main characters were very true to form.  If some people would have preferred to have Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford in the lead roles, I would like to remind them that those two famous singers played the role of Christine and the Phantom almost 20 years ago.  In this story, Christine is only 16, and up close with a movie camera, Sarah Brightman would have been unconvincing.  I am astonished that they found Emmy Rossum, who not only sings shockingly well (Sarah Brightman's London cast recording is the best, but Ms. Rossum was very good), but is also so ethereally beautiful and fits the role so perfectly and was only 16 at filming!  The Phantom was strong, mysterious and sexy, so much that the brave and loving Raoul was only a close second.  One reader commented that the Phantom's mask only covered part of his right face, but when the mask came off, most of his right face and head was disfigured.  I would note that the Phantom had several nice brunette wigs on his dresser, which would have covered the disfigured head areas and made him look nicer.The movie itself is very beautiful, and the movie format allowed us to see up and down the theatre, and gave greater depth to the musical story. On stage, the characters of the Phantom were seen at a distance.  With a movie camera, it allows us to see the characters up close (so that a 40+ year old Sarah Brightman would have been unconvincing as the young ingenue), and the sets really elaborated at the sets we saw on stage.  Watching the movie, I understood the plot much better and the singing seemed very natural.  For example, we meet the dancing instructor, the theatre stage hand, the two theatre owners, and follow their important roles in the story.  I especialy liked Carlotta as the spoiled musical tyrant.  The theatre was truly sumptuous.  The complicated scenes with the letters from the Phantom is easier to follow in movie format.  If Christine Daae is not the deepest female role, I would only note that Andrew Lloyd Webber did not create a particularly deep or rich role in the Christine; she's primarily beautiful, young, sings like a dream and strangely caught in love and/or mesmerized by two different men. The Phantom was dark, tormented, sexy and oddly pitiable, yet also contemptible with what he did to some people.  Raoul is the rich, loving knight in shining armour.  I thought the plot and tension between the three main characters, Christine, Phantom and Raoul, were great, and the romance was such that I was guessing at the ending until the very end (even though I've seen the stage production!) I have to buy this DVD so that I can watch it over and over again.	5.0	Amazingly good	2006-04-01	3	2	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AYB2RR9WW2OVR	"Word Maven ""Words, words, words"""	"I have seen ""The Phantom of the Opera"" on stage three times--in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York, the latter being one of Michael Crawford's last performances.  For some reason, I did not catch the film version when it was in theatres, but saw it a week ago via On Demand on HBO.  To be honest, I had been aware of some of the negative reviews, but I must say, this film is utterly amazing!  In my opinion, the only negative is Carlotta, the diva, whose part I felt was TOO over the top. I do not recall this part being so overblown in the stage versions.  I do not necessarily blame Minnie Driver, as her performance is probably what the director wanted.  All the rest of the roles were cast, acted, and sung to perfection. Emmy Rossum is perfect as Christine.  She brings an appropriate aura of naivet? and vulnerability to her role, and her vocal quality is also appropriate: youthful, promising, but not yet fully operatic.  We can really believe that she has the potential to blossom under the Phantom's tutelage.  Patrick Wilson's lyric tenor is ideal for the romantic hero role of Raoul.  But the movie truly belongs to Gerard Butler, who is an absolute revelation as the Phantom.  Director Joel Schumacher's decision to make the lead actors young (to attract a more youthful audience, as he and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber admitted) works very well indeed on film. Butler's edgy, passionate, and emotional singing, as well as his strikingly masculine looks makes the contrast between him and Raoul clearer for both Christine and the audience.  In every scene with Gerard Butler, he is the irresistible focal point, which is as it should be, since The Phantom is the titular character.  Because Butler plays up the Phantom's magnetic sensuality, we can really believe that Christine is mesmerized by his seductive powers.The film looks fantastic.  The device of opening and closing the story with the grainy, black and white sequences with the aged, wheelchair-bound Vicomte Chagny works well, and the dramatic change from B&W; to color as the theme music plays and the chandelier rises at the beginning is thrilling, to say the least. The Phantom's lair and the tunnels and catacombs leading to it were wonderfully conceived and lit.  The flickering candelabras emerging from the water were an impressive effect.  The huge orchestral accompaniment sounds marvelous.  Because I missed seeing the movie in a theater, I feel fortunate that I was able to watch it on our big plasma screen and hear the score on our surround speakers.  Yes, it's true--after having seen the movie on HBO's On Demand, I ordered the 2-disc DVD set from Amazon.  I recommend this version to anyone who has not bought the DVD yet, since the extras are quite interesting.  Schumacher and Webber discuss the musical's original conception and the casting for the movie version.  It had been a number of years since I last saw POTO onstage, and now as I watch clips from Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, I can really see why Schumacher insisted on casting younger actors for the lead roles.  In fact, as the clips of Crawford/Brightman played, I could hear how different their voices were, and how differently they acted the lead roles and to be honest,  Butler/Rossum bring a new flavor to the movie.  Their chemistry simply sizzles, and when they light up the screen together, you can see why Webber and Schumacher chose them.I have owned and played the London cast recording of the stage POTO for many, many years, but now, I find it disconcerting to listen to the discs, as Butler, Rossum, and Wilson have truly put their mark on the well-loved music of the night.  Kudos and Bravo to all!!"	5.0	Sizzling chemistry	2006-05-11	18	17	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	AMMEMPM9MPS55	www.DavidLRattigan.com	The long-awaited film of Andrew Lloyd-Webber's musical is not perfect, but director Schumacher surprises us enough to turn out perhaps the best of several screen versions of the famous tale.On the negative side, the two leads (Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum) lack vocal strength: His singing voice is annoyingly grating at times; and she sings through her nose too much. The visual style is a tad inconsistent, with Christine and the Phantom's first descent into the underworld looking too much like a pop video, and some of the more frenetic, Moulin-Rouge-inspired camerawork lacking in life. The additions occasionally detract from the flow, especially the unnecessary flashback to the Phantom's adolescence.In its favour is much, however. Lloyd-Webber's vision was always the most faithful to the original story, capturing Leroux's romance and fantasy as well as the horror. Despite the lack of vocal strength, Butler excels dramatically as a tortured anti-hero who invites compassion and understanding as well as terror; the tension between his tragic loneliness and his violent hatred against humanity is well-conveyed. Among the support, I most enjoyed Miranda Richardson's Madame Giry and Simon Callow's Andre.The new orchestrations do the music justice. The choreography, like the visual style, is inconsistent, but there are nevertheless some truly splendid numbers, staged with an eye for spectacle as well as a good sense of humour (e.g. Prima Donna). For the most part, despite the very obvious influence, Schumacher avoids mimicking the chaotic pace of Moulin Rouge, and the camera work is generally subtle at the right times.All the layers of the story are held nicely in balance, making The Phantom of the Opera a moving romantic fantasy, and very much the exhilarating experience that the stage show has always been.	4.0	Flawed, but quite possibly the finest of many adaptations	2005-06-06	5	1	4

The movie gives me a different view of this musical. Although both of musical and movie are the same story and same songs, there is a different present.I think none of Phantom's fans can miss this movie!	5.0	It's a wonderful movie!	2005-05-04	7	4	3
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A24R06Q6XWL2C9	W. Zhao	I haven't seen the musical, but have the soundtrack to it. I think this movie is a faithful rendition of the musical. The video transfer is great quality, the colors are fantastic! There were some jerky frames at the beginning for some reason. The audio is also excellent. Great dynamic range and clarity. I highly recommend this disc!	5.0	Great transfer	2007-02-19	0	0	0

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A7VCXPEDL49S6	"xXoTiCxpRiNcEsSx ""Tabitha ^.^"""	This movie is awesome! Ive never seen the musical befor because I never wanted to because I thought that musicals were boring and another reason is, is that Im only 15 so I cant drive myself to them and noone in my family likes musicals so Ive never seen one. But like I said befor, this movie is awesome! The Phantom is so sexy! All through-out the movie I was like 'Why is Christine picking pretty-boy Raoul over the sexy and mysterious Phantom?!?! I have no clue why she did.. maybe it was because part of his face was deformed? Well he wore a mask all the time and covered it up so I couldve lived with it because the part that wasnt all nasty was SEXY!! Most of my friends thought so to! And Emmy Rossum had an amazing voice! I heard Sarah Brightmans voice befor and to me, she sounds like an old grand-ma singing in a chroir! I like the way Emmy Rossum sings better! Her voice is so smooth. Its just so young and innocent but at the same time mature and seductive! All in all, I choose Emmy Rossum over Sarah Brightman all the way! All the characters in this movie act very well. I can see why this movie was #1 for so long! Raoul was a terrific actor and a wonderful singer but I wish that the phantom would have got the girl instead of him because its just so sad that the phantom has to be all alone his whole life now while Raoul would have had another chance at love while the phantom has to stay in the dungeon until the day he dies all alone never fully experiencing what its like to truly love and be loved back!! It made me cry!! And to me, the phantom was WAY more sexier than Raoul!!! And to all of you people who say that this movie sucks then you just dont know what a good movie really is! This movie is defiantly on my favorite movie list! Well this movie is defiantly a great buy! You should at least rent it if you dont want to buy it because its one of the greatest movies ever! So go ahead, buy it! I garuntee you that you will love it!	5.0	This Movie Is So Awesome! I Love It!!	2005-05-12	7	5	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2T8AS1JCRID98	Yisel	I've always liked The Phantom of the Opera...I've seen the play, TV series about it and I was looking forward the release of this movie. Emmy Rossum is such a talented and lovely girl...and she interprets Christine like an angel. Is so pleasant to hear her sing...that it is impossible you don't fall in love with this movie.There is luxury everyway, the cast in general is excellent...the music is beautiful, when I saw the movie I felt so identified with the story, the passion, the feeling, the beauty of the story that I can say that this is one of my favorites movies ever.I saw it at the movies, then I saw it in HBO, and I ended up buying the DVD because it is a must have. It is soft, delicate, beautiful...a perfect escape of those full of especial effects and violent movies. If you like musicals, you will love this one.	5.0	I just bought the DVD...Awesome movie!!	2006-05-21	6	4	2

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A3Q8QAG0OSGMT6	Yvonne Creek	"I did not get the chance to see the Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford version, so I can not comment on which one was better. I loved this version though, the music, the plot, the acting, everything was ""phantastic"". Although if you don't like musicals don't even try watching this film most of it is sung. I loved the entire movie and I don't think one part of it was out-of-step or wrong. Although I have never been a big fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber I was surprisingly pleased with this movie."	5.0	Phantastic!!!	2005-05-29	3	2	1

B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2Q377FWO8QUO5	"Yvonne Y. Cao ""Fallingwater"""	This is the best movie I had ever seen in my life.My words run dry and astonished by the dreamlike atmosphere Webber created. I think the Phantom was the most impressive figure I have ever seen in any movies. His passionate but desperate voice makes the tragic hero even more rivetted. And Wilson also did a good job as that handsome Raoul,although he looks a little bit naive. The dress he wore on the masquerade remind me a scene of &lt;&lt; The Beauty and The Beast>>. If I were Christine, I really cannot make a decision between the Phantom and Raoul. I think the Phantom is a half of her life, without him, she will never singing like an angel again. The last scene made me cry more than once. When the rose with black ribbon appeared on Christine's tomb, I know the love of the Phantom is perpetuated and even deeper than Raoul's. I am speechless now, I love the story so much, it is the most heart broken story in the world! Bravo! Bravo!	5.0	Bravo! I've watched the movie over and over again!	2005-05-24	4	3	1
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A1IZ6HFRXMIYOE	Zachary C. Heeren	If you're a fan of the Broadway series, I suggest you try this.  It is great on Blu-Ray, and the sound really kicks out.  Emmy Rossum is absolutely beautiful in this movie, so don't miss her ;).  Gerard Butler is not as good as Michael Crawford (the original Phantom), but he's still an awesome actor.	5.0	Decent Musical	2010-04-12	0	0	0
B0007TKNI8	The Phantom of the Opera [VHS]	A2EIWE357R7KAI	"Zedd ""Zedd"""	I have always been a very devoted Phantom fan, so when i heard there was to be a movie i was concerned hollywood would ruin such a wonderful piece. when i first saw the movie i was foolish enough to try and compare to the original cast (which i was fortunate enough to see twice) but now that i have watched a few more times i have come to accept that they are very different, not necessarily making the movie bad. I am quite glad they did not completely change the story (like hitchhikers guide to the galaxy for example).... for those of us who need a release between theater seats this will be good to have in the collection.	4.0	Very different.... but good for what it is...	2005-07-19	0	0	0
