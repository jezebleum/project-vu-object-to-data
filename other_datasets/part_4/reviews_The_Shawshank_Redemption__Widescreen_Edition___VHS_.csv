0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3UT41TWD7N0D5	AbeStreet	"One of the best films I've ever seen.  Unfortunately I did not get to see this film in the theaters. When this film was released in 1994 I had grown tired of the ""prison"" movie. I had already seen TANGO & CASH (T&C;) and LOCK UP (LU) both of these films starred Sylvester Stallone. I had also seen Death Warrant (DW) with Jean Claude Van Damme and figured that this would just be another run of them mill movie about a guy wrongfully imprisoned. Eventually I rented this film and boy was I wrong! Unlike the earlier mentioned films this was not an action flick but an emotional story about the hardships of prison life and the struggle an inmate encounters trying to maintain hope of eventually leaving the prison. I so enjoyed this movie that I obtained the original novel and found that while there are some changes to the story they are relatively minor and do not detract from the theme of the story. In my review I will compare the book to the film.1. In the book Andy Dufresne is in jail until 1975. In the movie he is only in jail until 1967.2. In the book Andy's poster at the time of his departure is one of Linda Ronstadt. In the movie it is Raquel Welch.3. In the book Andy served time under several wardens and head guards. In the movie Warden Norton was in office for Andy's entire prison stay as was the head guard Byron Hadley. Actually in the book Byron Hadley was the head guard when Andy arrived in Shawshank and had retired by the time Norton became warden.4. In the book Red is describe as Irish and although no reference is made to his race I assumed he was white. In the movie Red is black being portrayed by Morgan Freeman, and the character Red indicates that he is Irish. While this does not contradict the book I think by making Red an African American it differed from most readers conception of Red. However, Morgan Freeman did such a fine job in the role of Red it is impossible for me to think of anyone else in that role.5. In the book Andy, with help from a friend in the outside world, invests all his money prior to his arrest under a false identity so that when he leaves Shawshank he has money to start over with. In the movie Andy departs with Warden Norton's ill gotten gains to start his new life.6. In the book no warden commits suicide and no prisoner is killed after the warden stages a fake escape attempt. Both these acts occur in the move.There are other small differences between the movie and the book but none that alter the overall story. I would suggest to all that this story is worth reading and watching. There is a reason that it is ranked so high in IMDB's ranking chart.Just a bit of trivia for Stephen King fans. The character of Andy Dufresne also has a key cameo role in Stephen King's book APT PUPIL. It is Andy Dufresne that unknowingly helps escaped Nazi henchman Kurt Dussander set up a life in America. This occurs while Andy is working at the Maine bank prior to going to Shawshank."	5.0	It's hard to believe this film didn't win Best Picture!!!!!	2002-09-25	6	2	4

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1IUKCH5SSWUFD	actiondude	I am normally loathe to give *anything* a perfect score.  Perfect scores are just that: perfection.  I feel that this movie is indeed perfect.  Deep  characters, an excellent storyline, believable situations, you name  it.The hero, Andy receives a life sentence for the murder of his wife,  and then spends the next 20+ years living it out.  After quite some time,  Andy manages to make friends with a few of the inmates and after being  placed in a pivotal position, begins to make real improvements in the  prison rehabilitation practices.The movie draws you in and holds you  there.  There are very, very few movies on the planet that can achieve that  all-elusive place of causing you to forget that you're in the real  world.Set aside plenty of time to watch this masterpiece so you can  enjoy it uninterrupted and prepare to stand in awe of filmmaking as an art.	5.0	Man v.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2ZBF3W2TWH2M8	A Customer	If you do not have this movie in your collection, please don't be thwarted from purchasing it just because the DVD doesn't have a lot of flashy extras.  Although I understand the frustrations of misrepresentation, it  would be its own misrepresentation to tell people not to buy this movie  simply because an actor/director doesn't explain each outake step-by-step  or provide interactive trailer recommendations (aka commercials).  This  movie doesn't need a behind the scenes epilogue, you'll be able to get the  clear and beautiful message that was intended just from watching the movie.  This movie tugs at your very soul -- the stark prison setting only  dramatizes the real message of the movie: faith, friendship, and to decide  whether to 'get busy living or get busy dying'.	5.0	Outstanding	1999-12-28	1	0	1

It gives the viewer a good glimpse at what prison life might be like for inmates.  Morgan Freedman, especially as a narrator, was  fantastic.  I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a movie with a  good plot that keeps the viewer tied to the screen till the final  scene(which was directed perfectly, by the way).  Compared to the last  several movies I've laid my hands on, this one, by far, puts them to shame.	4.0	Great Movie!	2000-02-02	2	2	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ADLVFFE4VBT8	"A. Dent ""Aragorn"""	"I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered the Shawshank Redemption on Blu. It was my third, having already enjoyed the VHS and the DVD. It's one of my favorite movies, the all-time 'guy movie' (but all genders should love it), a show of friendship, loyalty, love of freedom and, above all, love of life in freedom. And who could tell a story better than Stephen King, the number one story-teller in residence? And who else practically exhales humanity if not Morgan Freedman as Red Redding? Add Tim Robins as the mysterious and never tired of living Andy Dufresne and it's a movie that at least I keep watching over and over again. I've already watched the Blu edition twice after having watched the DVD and the VHS who knows how many more times.But I won't be reviewing the movie or the script - it's been done thousands of times already by others, much better qualified. I only want to discuss this most impressive Blu-ray rendition. So, here it comes.THE BINDINGPhysically, it comes in what I see it's called a 'book' binding. I have one other edition of 'The Matrix' put together in the same fashion. It is literally a book. Hard-cover style, the disk attached to the inner side of the back cover. If you open the book, carefully, you will find glossy, beautifully illustrated pages dedicated to the many great actors that played in Shawshank, to Stephen King, of course, the director, the writer. Being a book, it doesn't lock. It also doesn't open very well so, like I said, open it carefully.I am not going to say that ""this book binding alone should be reason enough to get yourself the Blu edition"" because it would be silly but the pretty package shows that some TLC was invested when putting this together this release, unlike some other do-it-quick-and-cheap DVD-to-Blu translations - and they know who they are.PICTURE AND SOUNDThe quality is dramatically better when compared to the previous DVD edition. And, no, it does not compare with an upscaled DVD. I watched the first few minutes on the DVD and on the Blu on a PS3 that upscales DVDs and there is no comparison. There is some graininess in scenes shot in semi-dark surroundings but I would call the overall quality of the picture as somewhere between 'excellent' and 'spectacular'.Almost the same to be said about the sound. The TrueHD makes a significant difference on a 7.1 surround system. I know it because the Dolby 5.1 track is also included and even my untrained ears can tell the difference.SPECIAL FEATURESSadly, there's nothing new here. Three LENGTHY features (40-plus minutes each), including a full Charley Rose episode discussing the movie with all the two main actors and the director. The other two extras feature Stephen King, the script writer, the director, the actors, the town where the movie was shot, the 'Shawshank Prison' building (a former real prison in real life), even former 'true' prisoners, talking about how it really was. All three features are worth watching but, sadly, they are in the old 'narrow screen', low-res TV format with 2-channel stereo sound.An alternative sound track with director's commentary is also available.RATING THIS EDITIONWith all the little shortcomings noted, it HAS to be a 5-star because I'm comparing it with any of the prior editions. There are very few movies I have on DVD that I would buy again on Blu but, this would be the one I'd get even if I could only afford buying one.If you have a Blu player and you love The Shawshank Redemption you owe yourself getting this."	5.0	Blu-ray 'book' edition - a must have	2009-10-16	6	6	0

Frank Darabont creates CHARACTERS. Characters as opposed to types (like the stone-faced-cop/justice-maker, always successful, and who, in the process, ends up with a sexy girl stuck to his prominent pectorals). Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and the gang are real actors that, finally, get to do what an actor is meant to: ACT!!! This movie is a pearl born out of the mud and garbage that the American Movie Industry methodically throws at us with increasing zeal. But I would definitely forgive them if, at least once a year, they would give us a movie of this caliber. My advice? Buy it and watch it monthly if not weekly.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2JJF1AGTFEG01	Adrian Shepherd	I remember when this movie came out. I was sitting in my dorm room watching TV when the trailor came on and I thought there is no way I would ever watch it. A story about men in prison with no action, no love...what does that leave?? Well, months later I was talking to a friend and he mentioned how amazing it was. I didn't know what to say but since I needed something to watch asked if I could borrow it. I sat down with my parents, telling them I didn't really have an interest in it, but that we should give it a go because of my friend's recommendation.After watching it I can say that it had more than I could have imagined; story (far better than the book), emotion (hard to put into words) and the simple notion of hope. I rate it as the best movie I have ever seen. I recommend it to everyone I come across and to this day not one person has said they were disappointed with it. Everyone should watch this movie at least once...although I guarantee if you watch it a second time that you'll see and feel things that you missed the first time.Enjoy...	5.0	Could it have been any better?	2003-07-07	2	2	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1HW1Q3CDUWT75	"A. Felton ""voracious reader"""	I agree with miramaxfan. This is one of those movies where I wouldn't change a thing.  I'm a pretty picky movie-goer.  I like quality in a movie, in every aspect.  Sure I have my favorites among the silly and cheesy films, but for the most part, I'm a tough critic.I find myself without words to properly describe it.  It's a prison movie, yet it's more about freedom than anything--  freedom of both mind and body.  It's about the little things in our lives that make us truly free.My favorite scene in the movie is the one where Andy (Tim Robbins) receives the shipment of library materials and locks himself in the warden's office so he can play a record.  It is an aria from &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; and he turns on the loudspeakers so all the men in the yard can hear it too.  Red (Morgan Freeman) says  &quot;I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about. Truth is, I don't want to know. Some things are better left unsaid. I'd like to think they were singing about something so beautiful it can't expressed in words, and it makes your heart ache because of it. I tell you, those voices soared higher and farther than anybody in a grey place dares to dream. It was as if some beautiful bird had flapped into our drab little cage and made these walls dissolve away, and for the briefest of moments, every last man in Shawshank felt free.&quot;Gives me goosebumps everytime.  And everytime I see this movie it makes be cry a bit, laugh a bit, and most of all be thankful for my everyday freedom.	5.0	Perfect.	2001-02-09	0	0	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3BMUBUC1N77U8	ahoffoss	"Let me begin by saying I believe this to be the greatest movie ever made in the history or movie making.  That being said, if there were a way to give this a higher score,...I would.  I've read the book and this movie stays very true to it.  (aside from a few slight modifications to allow it to fit into the ""movie"" time frame)  In all honestly, I've probably watched this movie between 150-200 times.  And I plan to watch it even more.Now for the actual review:  *******There will be spoilers although I'm going to try not to do too much*******This movie takes place in the 1940's and chronicles the struggle of Andy Dufresne's (Tim Robbins) life sentence in Shawshank prison.  In the first scene we witness Andy in the courtroom being cross examined for the double murder of his wife and her lover.  Throughout his explanation, we see his words transformed into scenes depicting his time prior to the murder and what he says actually happened.  Unfortunately for Andy, his words are lost on the jury and the Judge sentences him to two consecutive life sentences (one for each victim).We get our first look inside Shawshank as Red (Morgan Freeman) and some other cons are placing bets on the incoming prisoners.  Each time a bus shows up, bets are placed on which convict will be the first to ""crack"".  After scanning the crew, Red puts all his chips on Andy.  A move that will unfortunately leave him 2 packs of smokes lighter the next morning.  During the night as the other prisons put pressure on the newbies, we discover just how brutal this prison can be as we are fully introduced to Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown).As time passes by, Andy begins his desire to return to a former hobby of his,....polishing and shaping rocks.  He learns that Red is the ""go to"" for smuggling in such items, so he introduces himself.  He and Red quickly form a friendship and so sets the stage for the rest of the movie.Andy quickly falls into a routine filled with both good times and bad (dealing with the other ""not so friendly"" inmates).  The monotony is finally broken when Andy reveals himself a most useful ""employee"" by giving some helpful advice to Captain Hadley while tarring a roof.  Hadley then introduces Andy to Warden Norton (Bob Gunton), who finds Andy a more suitable ""job"" than his current, working in laundry.  He sends Andy to work with librarian, Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore).  After learning about his former job as a Bank President and his help with Captain Hadley's ""problem"", the prison guards begin to come to Andy for financial advice and eventually help with their taxes.  As time passes Andy begins helping Warden Norton launder money through several different programs the Warden sets up. (all while maintaining his innocence)As the years go by, several things have changed at the prison.  Inmates have been released (Brookes) and new ones have arrived. (Tommy - Gil Bellows).  During this time, Andy has been busy building the new ""Brooks Hatlen Memorial Library"", which is considered ""the finest prison library this side of the Mississippi"".  Tommy hears that Andy has helped some inmates get their high school diplomas, so he approaches Andy for help.  During this time Tommy learns of Andy's past and reveals something he's learned during his stay's at various prisons in his lifetime.  With this new information in hand, Andy goes directly to Warden Norton for help, but is, instead, refused.  Andy explains the situation, which only angers the warden and as punishment, is thrown into solitary confinement for a month (which is then extended to two months).  During his time in the hole, Andy learns that Tommy has, in deed, passed his high school equivalency test (with a C+ average).  By the time Andy gets out, Tommy is no longer in the prison and time continues.....At this point, Andy has had enough and decides his time in the jail has come to an end.  He approaches Heywood (William Sadler) on the loading docks and asks for a 6' length of rope.  Without thinking, Heywood gives him the rope and goes about his business.  When Red learns of this, he can't sleep and spends the whole night worrying.  The next morning every prisoner is accounted for,...except Andy.  When the guards rush to his cell to find out what's taking him so long, they not only realize the existing problem, but are then faced with one MUCH, MUCH worse!I REALLY don't want to ruin this movie for the few people still left that haven't seen it.  It is, in my opinion, the greatest ending ever!  The best thing about the movie is not only does it have the perfect ending, but it actually explains how the ending is accomplished.  Without the original story by Stephen King, we wouldn't have had the movie adaptation.  So, if you get the chance to read the book, you should definitely do so!"	5.0	Greatest movie EVER!	2014-02-07	1	1	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A24YME33WJ71LY	AJ Starling	"Andrew Dufresne is a man convicted of a crime he didn't commit.  This is the start of the film but it's basically a catalyst for changing the lead characters life as well as a few others.After being convicted of a double-homicide, Andy is stripped of his life of privilege and sent to feared Shawshank Prison.  Once there things go from bad to worse for him, but that's only for the first few years.  Eventually the warden learns that Andy has special financial talents that can be put to use by means that are legal and otherwise.A twist of fate will cause Andy to get so close to a new trial and the possibility of freedom and redemption that he can taste it.  But prison is not a fairy tale world as the viewer learns from Andy's friend Red.  But hope is never completely lost, and the man who perseveres can triumph over great adversity.There is a happy ending, but don't believe for a second that this is a happy film.Shawshank Redemption is a movie based on a Stephen King story titled ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.""  The movie is dark, but more importantly has adult tones and therefore I recommend not allowing children under the age of 14 to view this film.  This film deals with aspects of prison life that most people would just like to pretend don't exist.The soundtrack is a great bit of music and could stand alone, but works even better within the movie.  The symphonic score was composed by Thomas Newman.  There's even some Mozart thrown in for a few minutes.  Hank Williams sings a song for those who don't like classical.Not much on DVD extras here, but a great movie worth owning."	5.0	What happens when and honest man goes to prison?	2003-05-27	0	0	0

Morgan Freeman is at his pinacle with thought provoking acting while Tim Robbins(hate his personal politics) draws out lonely, innocencent yearnings in every way. Its actually bordering on a masterpiece of filmwork. It would be difficult to walk away from watching this film in its entirety not feeling that you've learned something big. As of this date the promised hd version is yet to be seen. Although the dank prison surroundings do not seem to demand a definitive hd transfer, clarity of viewing can only increase the already  cutting realism. I look foward to the blissful moments that give hope and make you watch - in high definition. I can only be forced to ask, whats the hold up?

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ANUN5B8HYZXEJ	Alexander Arsov	For once, the IMDB top 250 is pretty close to the truth! I am perfectly dismayed to see in Top 10 such perfectly mediocre movies, to say the least, like ''Pulp Fiction'' or ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'', but ''The Shawshank Redemption'' and ''The Godfather (Part 1)'' sharing the first place is one of the exceptions when popular taste seems to go hand in hand with great and profound art.''The Shawshank Redemption'', indeed, is one of those movies which are extremely close to perfection; perhaps the indifferent soundtrack is the only weak point but this is of no consequence. The movie has a terrific screenplay, to begin with. Hardly is there a scene that is less than memorable, and most are unforgettable, and the dialogue is superb throughout, combining light humour with unobtrusive but far from negligible philosophical depth. I was amazed to learn that the scene with Mozart's music is not in Stephen King's original, and indeed he didn't like it. I have always thought of this scene as one of the most moving in the movie, together with the harrowing lives of those who come out after 40 or 50 years of imprisonment. It really is damn true that everything in life boils down to this ultimate question: ''Get busy living, or get busy dying?'' In addition to all that, Frank Darabont's direction is masterful. I honestly envy everybody who watches this movie for a first time without knowing any details of the story; he will be able to appreciate Darabont's genius for directing which is apt to be overlooked after numerous viewings. To take but one example: the discovery of Andy's escape and the explanation of it, with the retrospect shots, the consequences and Red's narrative, is well-nigh perfectly executed scene.Having mentioned Andy and Red, need I add that the cast is outstanding? Too bad that Tim Robbins never attained a more prominent place in the Hollywood hall of fame, for he is a fine actor of considerable talent, but Morgan Freeman did. And it is he who delivers many of the most haunting lines here, such as his great (and so true!) speech about the definition of ''institutionalized'' culminating in ''They send you here for life, and that's exactly what they take. The part that counts, anyway.'' Few actors have the ability of Morgan Freeman to make the best of their lines without in the least exaggerating. The supporting cast is equally perfect. Bob Gunton as the warden and Clancy Brown as the chief guard, both of them profoundly sadistic and with rather perverse ideas of gratitude (though I confess I enjoyed Hadley's ''thanks''), are fantastic and so are some of the inmates such as William Sadler as the greatest fan of Hank Williams, Mark Rolston as one of the Sisters who are not homosexual because ''one must be human first and they don't qualify'' (Red) and especially James Whitmore as the old Brooks, probably the most heart-rending character in the movie.There really is no need of wasting words. ''The Shawshank Redemption'' remains one of the most powerful tributes to human spirit ever made for the screen. Everybody MUST see this gem at least once. It is an incredibly inspiring movie, a movie that gives me hope (yes, the best of things!) in human nature like few other works of art, let alone personal experiences, do. Like another equally shattering masterpiece (''One Flew over Cuckoo's Nest''), it reminds us, the free men who rather presumptuously calls ourselves ''normal'', that prisons and lunatic asylums are full, not so much with monsters of depravity, but mostly with ordinary people like you and me who just did one stupid thing more or for whom the pressure of society turned out to be too much; to say nothing of the ridiculously inept prison system rife with callousness and cruelty that range from terror behind the bars to starving outside of them. What better way to finish than one memorable quote from Red's ''institutionalized speech'':''These walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them. That's institutionalized.''	5.0	''Hope is a good thing, perhaps the best of things.''	2011-06-19	3	2	1

Now to the movie review:This is a very, very, very good movie. I had no idea what it was about only that Morgan Freeman was in it. Overall the movie is based on a simple premise: hope. Without giving anything away, the movie literally pulls the viewer in and doesn't let go. The movie is almost 2 1/2 hours, but honestly, you'll never notice. The acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is phenomenal. Their chemistry on the screen seems effortless. Seriously, I forgot I was watching a movie, and instead felt like I was within the story itself. The storyline is well done and is written based on a novel by Stephen King (who knew?!).

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	Every time I watch `The Shawshank Redemption' my first thought upon its closing is `how in the world did this lose the Best Picture Oscar to `Forrest Gump'?'.  In all honesty there really is no comparison when you look at the two films.  One is a generic feel good film wrapped in saccharine clich&eacute;s and the other, this one, is a magnificent character study that slowly yet poignantly captures the very essence of life.No comparison.`The Shawshank Redemption' begins with banker Andy Dufresne being wrongfully accused of murdering his wife and her lover.  He is sentenced to two life sentences (due to his cold demeanor) to be served at Shawshank correctional institution.  He is immediately pegged as a weakling, not build for survival within the prison walls, but Andy soon turns heads as he proves those presumptions false.  Not only is he built for survival, but his presence ultimately helps the other inmates survive as well.  The film focuses on Andy and fellow inmate Red as they build a friendship that will last them forever, each of them learning from and teaching each other about life and what you make of it.  Red has been in prison a time now and has a lot to teach Andy about life within the prison walls, but in the end it is Andy's lessons of hope that bring a new light to Red's eyes.When watching `The Shawshank Redemption' I am constantly in awe at its power.  There is not a single aspect of this film that feels off kilter or missing; in fact I cannot think of a single flaw to write about.  It's hard when a film is this astonishing, for how can you really critique it, and no one wants to read redundant praising that lasts paragraph after paragraph.I will praise it though, and hopefully these praises don't find themselves repetitious.The first major selling point to this film is the script, which beautifully captures the genuine emotional state of the men involved.  You have the fear and hopelessness that corrupts the minds of the newly incarcerated, as well as the comfortable contentment that glosses over those fears as you adjust to life on the inside.  You have the greed and selfishness that infiltrates the eyes of those with power, and the disgust and resentment that permeates the air.  What I think is brought out to perfection is the displacement that shatters the lives of those `lifers' who find themselves out on parole, living amidst the rest of the world and unable to adjust to this freedom that feels to foreign to them.  Every single emotion bubbles to the surface and captivates the audience.Seriously people; `Forrest Gump'?From a technical standpoint, this film is superb.  The camera angles and close framed cinematography is stunning and helps capture each of the emotions the script so wonderfully fleshes out.  You audience can feel the restraint and claustrophobia that the characters feel emotionally, expounding upon the already deeply rooted emotional resonance.  The score, the lighting, the mood, the direction; everything helps elevate the film and create a magnificent cinematic experience.And then, there is the acting.Much praise has been given to Morgan Freeman for his powerful and moving portrayal of Red, but one cannot single out Freeman without mentioning Tim Robbins who serves as the emotional and moral clutch of the whole film.  Without his riveting performance the film would have failed to amount to all that it has become.  As Andy, Robbins brilliantly sifts through his emotional response to his surroundings, capturing his misery but never losing his hope, even when all feels lost.  Freeman is the perfect compliment to Robbins, cycling though Red's loyalty and admiration as well as his experienced emotional callousness.  They are the perfect pair and in all honestly should have BOTH been nominated at the Academy Awards.The long list of supporting players is also exceptional, from Clancy Brown's diabolical Captain Hadley to the slew of inmates that inhabit Shawshank.  William Sadler is memorable as Heywood, and James Whitmore is devastatingly real as Brooks.  His sub-plot regarding his release is one of the most resounding moments in the film.  Gil Bellows has a nice turn as Tommy, a young spunky rookie who makes an impact on the lives of Andy and Red; but when we are speaking of supporting players the one that stands out the most is none other than Bob Gunton.  His portrayal of the sinister Warden Norton is flawless.  He creeps up on you slowly, tearing at your nerves, and when he finally comes out and nails Andy with the bluntest of threats you are utterly blown away.In the end I am ashamed that the Academy went for generic and happy over meaningful and moving.  `The Shawshank Redemption' is not only the greatest film of 1994, but it is possibly one of the greatest films ever made.  There is so much to be learned about ourselves and others, so much which is lurking within every crevasse of Shawshank that we cannot just see this film once but are forced to witness its power over and over again.In the end `The Shawshank Redemption' is about just that; redemption.  One is uplifted upon the closing frames, the fact that hope prevails further cemented into their souls.  `The Shawshank Redemption' is the perfect example of a perfectly balanced film, one that slowly yet masterfully weaves a tail of humanity, starting with emotional death and ending with an abundance of life.	5.0	The very reason cinema exists...	2008-08-25	0	0	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3JV8S5MFX0FXH	Andrew	I first saw this movie on board a bus heading to boston, and was thrilled with this movie. It is about a man, who has been falsely accused of murder. He is then sent to the Shawshank Prison, where he spends ten years before escaping.  The movie really portrayed what it can be like in prisons-- not how the guards treated people-- but hoe prisoners treat each other. During the movie, you forget that the people are convicts and criminals, and then think of them as people.  During the course of the movie, we see Andy, the main character, bring dramatic changes to the prison, and how he copes with life there. He gets a library, a way for inmates to get out and do better work in the community, educates some of the people he befriends, and uncovers the scandel that the prison warden is doing.  This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen, and it is plain to see why it won the nominations that it did.	5.0	An Awsome Movie	2001-06-05	2	1	1
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A30Z5XEY56GNBE	andrew@michigancityin.com	Being a Stephen King fan, I first read the novella upon which &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is based when I was 12 and immediately considered it my favorite King work. What amazed me is how Frank Darabont  not only remained faithful to the book but made it his own and, more  importantly, into one of the decade's most moving. There's great poetry in  Morgan Freeman's voice and the last 15 minutes of the film absolutely  reduced me to tears.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ABSX5TGEGRH76	"Andrew ""Radaar"""	"The Shawshank Redemption is widely considered to be one of the greatest films in history, and that claim definitely is valid.  Telling the stories of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), the film looks at the brutality of prison life and how sometimes, the most human people in the prison are the prisoners as opposed to the guards.Convicted of killing his wife and the man she was sleeping with, Andy is sent to Shawshank Prison, one of the grittiest and most terrible prisons in Maine.  The warden, Sam Norton (Bob Gunton) is a stern man of God who is a crook at heart; he ""allows"" Andy, who is a former banker, to manipulate the prison accounts so that he can appropriate extra money.  The guard captain Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) beats prisoners with very little provocation, in fact, he had his men beat a man to death on his first night because he was crying.  However, the prisoners aren't saints either.  Beatings, rape, and other kinds of abuse go on between prisoners, and the guards tend to let it happen.  Meanwhile, Red looks on as Andy slowly adjusts to life at Shawshank.  Red is ""the guy who can get stuff"", and Andy begins requesting strange items.  He asks for a rock hammer so that he can continue his hobby of geology and he asks for a poster of Rita Hayworth in order to have something pretty to look at.  Andy and Red become friends, and soon Andy is fairly popular around the yard.He cements his status as the favorite of both the guards and the prisoners when he gives valuable financial advice to Hadley in exchange for getting some beers for his friends.  Soon, Warden Norton employs him in the prison library, which he turns into the most comprehensive and well-run prison library in New England.  Eventually, Andy becomes the go-to guy in Shawshank, turning felons and guards into more civilized people.In addition to the story, the movie has great themes and observations.  Throughout his sentence, Andy claims that he is innocent of the crime.  After he begins doing shady accounting for Norton, Andy comments to Red that it wasn't until after his incarceration that he became a crook.  The ideas of hope and fear are expertly dealt with in the film.  Both are seen as having the possibility to do good or evil, and it all comes down to how we want our lives to turn out.For a movie about prison life, The Shawshank Redemption is surprisingly uplifting.  It has numerous moments of intense violence and hatred, but overall, it is a story about hope and the goodness that can exist even in the hardest of convicts.  This movie should definitely be on every person's list of movies to see in their lifetime."	5.0	A Wonder In Filmmaking	2006-02-28	6	6	0

To be honest, I really didn't even know what the movie was about because it was in and out of the first-run theater quickly.The acting is this movie is excellent!  You really feel for the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ALM78HPVU4LN8	Andy	"Ok...This is in my top three favorite movies of all time.  I just want to get that out of the way.  But you don't have to love this movie to see that Katie's review is completely ridiculous! Did you actually watch this movie Katie???Allow me to explain:""...so instead they rely on a crazy coincidence: it just SO HAPPENED that the night Andy was drunk and considering shooting his wife and her lover, they got murdered by someone else! Wow! Now THAT is timing!""-Uhhhh...that's only the whole premise to the freakin' story!  the rest of the plot would fall apart if that wasn't part of it.  Just a guy busting out of prison? The fact that he is actually innocent is the whole tamale.  And what's wrong with thinking people wouldn't sympathize with a murderer?  it's true! People would have a hard time with that.  And even if they did sympathize with him...they probably wouldn't be cool with a murderer busting out of prison.  The viewer is that much more excited that an innocent man busted out and made good.""The part that was most ridiculous to me was when they killed Tommy. Why wouldn't they let Andy get a retrial? Why did they actually MURDER the kid and not just, like, threaten him or send him to an insane asylum or something? ""--Ok...this is the most ridiculous one of all.  This is what makes me think you just didn't pay attention. The Warden doesn't want Andy to get a retrial because Andy is the guy running all his scams!! Not only that...but Andy might tip off the authorities to what the Warden was doing if he got out.  Remember...the warden was kind of a jerk.  And Tommy was only 2 years away from getting out of Shawshank...if the Warden didn't help Andy out..Tommy would have just done it himself as soon as he was out.  And what do you mean ""put him in an insane asylum""??  So the warden can just throw anyone he wants into an insane asylum and that person is never evaluated by doctors???""Another part that I found rather dumb was how Andy escaped. I guessed from day one that he kept that rock hammer in the Bible; it's one of the most cliche stowing places of all time, so why wouldn't they check it during a cell inspection? Wouldn't they also make sure that nothing was behind a poster? ""--After the first cell inspection (when Andy held it close to him...trying to hide it)  he became the Warden's pet convict.  He was shown all kinds of favortism after that.  They let things slide.""And I'd like to know how a former convict breaking parole could make it to Mexico""--If it's Andy you are talking about..he had that whole fake identity thing set up...remember???  If it's Red you are talking about...this was the 60's..they didn't have automated systems to check parole status..Even today...any American can go over the border into Mexico without showing his ID...ever been to Tijuana?? sheeeeshh...this is waaay too easy""Also, how the heck Andy got a suit to go to the banks in""--Once again...did you actually SEE this movie???  It was the WARDEN'S suit that he was supposed to take to the laudry...he was wearing it underneath his prison uniform when he went back to his cellFinally....""Why is it called the Shawshank Redemption if Andy is innocent? And no one else was redeemed""--Red was the character they were referring to. Remember...the story is told from his perspective...and don't forget that little insignificant scene when he finally gets his parole approved.if you have any questions....ten33dispatcher@sbcglobal.net"	5.0	"Response to ""Katie-SporkGoddess"""	2005-11-10	5	5	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2QHM5HBSIXRL4	Andy Orrock	I recently caught &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; during one of its 962 yearly showings on TNT (whenever they're not playing &quot;Top Gun&quot;).  I won't try to encapsulate my rapture like the other reviewers have done here (almost) uniformly and very effectively.  It's as good or better than every word written on these pages.What I will say is that I savaged Tim Robbins' &quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot; in an earlier review, and now after seeing &quot;Shawshank Redemption,&quot; I'm feeling no small bit of remorse about that.  Robbins' stunning work in &quot;Shawshank&quot; gives him the absolute right to pursue projects like &quot;Cradle.&quot;Tim, if you're out there: sorry about that, man.

Tim Robbins does a very believable and effective job in this film, as does Morgan Freeman, as the con long denied parole who finds that being brutally honest can be a good thing.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A13T9FCU0J1GO5	Anthony Sunclades	This is my favorite film, and over the years I have watched it grow from a near box office flop to one of the most beloved films.  This is the tale of Andy Dufrense convicted of murdering his wife &quot;and the fella she was banging.&quot; Andy is then sent to Shawshank prison to server back to back life sentences. While there he meets Red, the only guilty man in Shawshank, and his group of friends that make the time easier. He also meets Boggs and the bull queers who make his life a living hell.  Through the course of actions, Andy begins to accept he is in prison and makes the best of it.  He uses his skills as a banker to do favors for the warden and the guards, and in return he tries to make Shawshank more tolerable for all, by building a library and helping to educate the inmates.  Andy seems content to remain in prison, he has found his niche, then he gets word that there may be evidence that could set him free, when the warden disregards the information, Andy generally goes insane and makes a last ditch effort to get out. The film is a roller coaster of emotions, some comical, some tragic, and in the end total redemption.  I have seen it many times and still come close to tears at points.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman create wonderful characters and should have both won Oscars.  Since this films release it has moved to number 2 on the IMDB.com list, just behind the Godfather.About the DVD: It is sparse, which is to say that it does not have the toys that we have come to know and love from our discs (Behind the scenes, trailers, deleted scenes, directors/actors commentary) this one only has the Theatrical trailer.  Hopefully with this being the 10 year anniversary of The Shawshank Redemption, Warner Brothers will capitalize on the occasion and release a collectors edition rife with all the requisite goodies.T	5.0	One of the greatest films of all time	2004-02-21	4	4	0

It is based on a short story: ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" written by Stephen King.Right from the beginning you can feel the injustice done to Andy Dufrense (played expertly by Tim Robbins)and find yourself rooting for him. Morgan Freeman is also very good as Andy Dufrense's  friend  and fellow cell mate ""Red"" Redding. Morgan also lends his voice as the movie's narrator. Both actors are at their peak and deliver a great performance in the movie.Set in the dark halls of a fictitious Maine state penitentiary called Shawshank. It is a story about redemption and hope against incredible odds. Andy's character suffers every injustice you can imagine occurs in prisons but never gives into the circumstances and tries to rise above it. You will not be the same after watching this movie.

The lead character, Andy Dusfrene (played brilliantly by Tim Robbins) is falsely accused of the double murder of his wife and her lover, and he arrives at Shawshank Prison where corruption, murder, bribery, and sadism take place daily.  He befriends Ellis &quot;Red&quot; Redding (also brilliantly played by Morgan Freeman) and the two begin a long and poignant friendship.Both go through the trials and tribulations of prison life as Andy tries in his own unique way to bring some normalcy and even beauty into their surroundings.  But Andy has a secret that we don't discover until well into the film; A secret destined to change the lives of both he and his friend. This secret leads to many twists and turns and finally to the shocking and inspiring ending of the movie.Of particular note, is the superb performance of Bob Gunton who plays prison warden Samuel Norton. Why he didn't get the Academy Award for his role is beyond me!  He does some of the best acting in a supporting role that has EVER been done by ANY actor.This film showcases the indomitability of man's spirit as well as the farther reaches of his courage.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2QA095LQPDBJD	Ariel Escasa	It has long been my contention that it is the moviemaker's task to hold the viewer's attention, not to burden him with his self-indulgent, difficult-to-follow symbolisms.That having been said, I find it difficult to find another movie I would recommend more highly than The Shawshank Redemption. Without any high-adrenaline action sequences or steamy sex scenes (two sure-fire ways to get the vewer's attention), this film somehow has the power to make you sit through all 142 minutes without for a moment getting bored. And I challenge anyone who has seen it to delete any scene, even any minute, from the final edit. The fact is, you can't. Because every single scene is an essential element that contributes to the final result: a masterpiece that captures the drama of enduring friendship and resiliency of the human spirit more powerfully than any other film ever made. Even those who normally do not watch movies with a critical eye will find themselves so drawn into this experience. I really can't say enough about this film. Suffice it to say that this is certainly the Greatest Movie Not to Win an Oscar. (Since Citizen Kane, at least. )Actually, I can forgive the Film Academy for not honoring this film with the Oscars I firmly believe it deserved. But when the American Film Institute in 1998 put together their list of The 100 Greatest Movies of all time (covering the period from 1896-1996), and so myopically overlooked Shawshank in favor of such titles as Rocky, Dr. Strangelove, Network, and Jaws, well, I thought that was absolutely ridiculous.I wouldn't hesitate to put it in the top five of all time.	5.0	The Greatest Movie Not to Win an Oscar	2003-06-11	330	306	24

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3D4ZIEM6OZ98A	Atrab Aon&lt;3	Shawshank Redemption is a remarkable movie with an amazing director: Frank Darabont, and with astounding actors: Tim Robins, playing the role of Andy Dufresne, and Morgan Freeman, playing the role of Ellis Boyd Redding, also known as Red. With the amazing plot and props help you experience what being in prison would feel like. With excellent timing of 2 hrs. and 22 min., the story seems to express a total of 20 years in great detail. Both themes of redemption and friendship show greatly throughout the movie. Shawshank Redemption is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.Andy Dufresne, a very clever and mild mannered New England Banker, is convicted of murdering his wife and her secret lover and is sent to jail. Despised at first by other inmates, he is quite and keeps his business to himself. Andy slowly creates a friendship with Red, known for his ability to smuggle things in to the jail, and his gang. Later, Andy also forms a friendship with the guards by assisting them with financial help and is rewarded with protection from the rougher convicts. To add even more exitement  to the plot, the Prison Warden takes advantage of his banking knowledge for financial counseling and will go as far as to kill someone to maintain him in the jail, even if there is evidence that he is innocent. Andy is able to preserve his sanity and dignity by using his mental force. His smarts and confidence keep him going and he is able to teach the other prisoners that hope is the ultimate mean of survival.Shawshank Redemption taught me, and I hope everyone who has seen it a great lesson. It taught me that violence will get you nowhere. Instead when you use your brain, and strive to do the best that you can, you will almost always win. Feeling that Shawshank Redemption's rating of R for language and prison violence is not a fair rating and therefore I recommend it to all people 13 and older. I recommend this movie not only to people who like dramas, but to people who love comedies, action, inspiring movies, and all others because no matter what type of movies you like, you'll love Shawshank Redemption.	5.0	go see this	2012-01-11	1	1	0

The evidence was circumstantial, but to be fair, there was really no other suspect. He was sent to Shawshank Prison for two life terms. The warden is a sadistic bastard with a Bible. The captain of the guards is at least as brutal, but doesn't pretend with the Bible.A couple of cells down from Andy's is Red (Morgan Freeman), the guy who can get things for you. He has a delivery system set up through the laundry delivery. Apparently the laundry done at the prison is for more than just their own use. Andy and Red become friends, watching each other's backs in the brutal world of the prison.One day Andy overhears Captain Hadley (of the prison guards) bitching about how he inherited $35,000 from his brother's estate, but it will probably be cut to nothing by the IRS. Andy, who had been a banker before his wife was killed, risks his wrath to interrupt his conversation and point out that he could set it up in a trust so the IRS would not get a penny.This begins a new ""career"" for Andy of doing taxes and estate planning for all the guards, and especially for the warden. In fact, he becomes the warden's personal accountant. As a cover, he is assigned to be assistant to the librarian, Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore). Through endless letter-writing to the state comptroller, he eventually gets a $500 grant to refurbish a room to be a real library. He helps several prisoners learn to read, and to take the GED test for a high school diploma.So what happens when one of the young men he helps to take the GED test mentions that his cell mate in an earlier prison had bragged about killing Andy's wife and her lover? Ah, that's the meat of the story, and for that you must see the film. Believe me, it is worth it."	5.0	Way Better Than I'd Expect of a Prison Drama	2012-05-12	2	2	0

Tim Robbins (Andy) and Morgan Freeman (Red) head up a terrific cast in this thrilling drama about life inside the walls of Shawshank Prision. This movie keeps you guessing. I love how they never tell you why Red is in there, makes you wonder.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1A5N7IDUGZZJ5	Becky VonBank	This turned out to be a really great assignment. I was told to watch this movie not knowing anything about it for an assignment. I have to say this is one of the better movies I have seen. I gave it a four star rating for a few reasons. The first reason is because it&#8217;s not necessarily one of my favorites but I did like it a lot. The second reason is that it is a little long and the plot line was a little scattered.  It was a story about hope and resilience. How an innocent man could be put away for two life sentences and maintain such composure. This movie was an inspiration. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) was a highly educated man who had his life turned upside down, and still had the mind set to better the prison system. Wrongfully convicted he had the perseverance to create the biggest library for a prison at that time. This movie really makes you think at the end, why did he do what he did and for what. It was a little slow in the beginning, but it picked up in the end. I recommend this to anyone who likes murder mystery and anything dealing with prison breakouts.	4.0	School project	2014-04-02	0	0	0

However, you have to remember that, if you're sitting there enjoying it and willing to pay attention to each and every line from the characters, not to mention willing to pay attention to each new direction the story takes, then it can't be THAT bad.  Come on now.The final 30 minutes of film were totally worth it.  Think about this- a guy breaks out of prison that can actually have some emotion connected to it?  Yes it's true.Morgan Freeman once again shows us why he has never been awful in any film ever.  His presence can only increase the amount of enjoyment you get from a movie.

Andy Dufrane (Tim Robbins) is accused of murdering his wife and the guy she was cheating on Andy with.  He is found guilty and sentenced to life in Shawshank prison.  While in prison he meets Morgan Freeman, a fellow inmate.  They become best friends and go through a whole series of events together in prison.  The ending is the most moving part of the whole movie, what Morgan says at the end just makes you stop and think about life.  This is a truly moving movie.  Unfortunatley, though nominated for some Oscars like, Best Actor(Morgan Freeman), Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture.  However no winners at all.  Because of only one movie, Forrest Gump.  It took just about every Oscar that Shawshank was up for.

Not one to  be missed for the emotion presented by Robbins and Freeman.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A24456FPYCCSMG	Ben hayden	Way back in 1994 first time director Frank Darabont adapted Stephen Kings short story about a mild mannered bank manager played by Tim Robbins is accused for murdering his wife and her lover there for he is sent to  Shawshank prison. There he meets Red played by Morgan freeman were they  develop a long time friendship. At first when red first sees him he thinks  he is unfit for prison life but Robbins in a great role is clam and  reserves his emotions and actions. At the end is when it is most  drmatically effective. Frank darabont knows how to adapt works by Stephen  King and in 1994 critics complained because it was a long 142 mins but  you'll see why it needs this time at the end. Nominated for seven oscars it  didn't win one. I think that Darabont is a first rate director and knowsa  his stuff i could see Darabont thanking the acadamy someday in the future.  The first time i saw it i thought that it was two disturbing but after i  watched it enough i found out what i was missing. A great movie. Although  this is better than The Green Mile another King adaptation by Darabont  which is also great.	5.0	The Shawshank Redemption	2000-04-01	1	0	1
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2YAABMT80RLYA	Ben Rowland	"If I were to rate this based on the movie alone, it would get 5 stars, no contest. But the fact that the DVD is so unremarkable drags the rating down much lower than the movie deserves. Keep reading and you'll see my reasons.I cannot praise the movie well enough, since it is one of my all time favorites. It tells the story of Andy Defresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who was wrongfully convicted of murder, and spent 19 years in prison for it. During his time, he befriends a pretty, but intellegent, crook (Morgan Freeman), and their bond solidifies as the years grow. Dufresne himself makes a difference in almost all the prisoner's lives, by showing that the cruelty of the prison cannot darken his will and spirit. It is an inspiring movie, it's almost hard to believe that it is based on a Stephen King story. Everything about the movie fits, the acting, the writing, and the entertainment. It is an exceptional movie.Why is it that Warner decided to release this great movie in DVD devoid of quality extras. Next to one theatrical trailer, some totally uninteresting filographies, and a paper-thin photo gallery, there is nothinh else of interest beside the movie itself. There are no commentaries, no featurettes, and no insight from the filmmakers. Basically, everything you would want is not included on the DVD. But worse yet is the packaging. I don't know why Warner thinks that it's a good idea to sell DVDs in those cheap ""Snapper"" cased (The thin cardboard with a plastic frame that 'snaps' on the side), because it will not last long without getting dinged and scratched. As a principle, I refuse to buy movies in ""Snapper"" cases. This was the one exception.If you already have the VHS version, the only real incentive to get the DVD is the anamorphic widescreen transfer, which gives the picture a crisp, clear look. The sound quality is also nicely kicked up, and it's a special benefit to those with surround sound, because it's the next best thing to actually being in the theatre.One of the biggest qualms I have with the standard of DVDs today is that second-rate movies get the 2-disc ""all inclusive"" DVD treatment, while brilliant movies like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" get the minimalist, barren treatment. I am hoping that they will release a special edition DVD sometime in the near future, because this is not the ""definitave edition"" of the movie. Fingers crossed."	3.0	One of the best movies ever deserves a better DVD.	2002-09-30	58	41	17
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A20EEWWSFMZ1PN	"bernie ""xyzzy"""	Sorry for such a late review of this film however this is not my type of movie. I shy away from any kind if institutionalized films. Never being institutionalized I can only assume that it is the way the films they picked it and do not normally want to waste my life watching this sort of thing. However the opportunity arose and I have great respect for the main actors including Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. I was surprised at how well acted this movie is. Even the period costumes in the background music matched so well that you forgot you were watching the movie. Now I guess the only thing left to do is to read the book.Barring the twists and turns and subplots of this story is basically about two imprisoned men and how they bond over a number of years, surviving the many institutional foes. The question is not will they, but how they find redemption.I'm glad that I watched this movie till the end and I suggest that you do the same.	5.0	Excellent film	2011-12-18	2	2	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2BW9U1CSLIHJX	Big Erik	Any time I ask someone what their favorite movie is, Shawshank Redemption always comes up in their top five.  This movie is nothing short of brilliant.  Every single role is perfectly portrayed by each actor, from the leads, with Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, all the way down to the smallest supporting roles.  This is NOT your simple everyday prison drama.  It reaches for greater heights of filmaking and even larger themes, such as patience(a theme rarely touched upon in cinema), hope, perseverence, sacrifice, true friendship, and resolve(get busy living or get busy dying).  That's a long list and there's probably more.  Anyway, the basic jist of the story is an accountant(Tim Robbins) gets thrown in prison for murdering his wife and her lover(we don't know whether or not he did it, the camera cuts away as we see him loading his gun).  When he gets to prison, people start realizing that there is something different about him.  The danger and reality of his situation doesn't seem to affect him, it's as if he is separated from his surroundings and has his own island of calm and steady resolve. Interestingly, the film is narrated by a long time inmate(Morgan Freeman) who soon befriends Robbins.  This subtle touch helps add to the mystique of Robbins' character because we never really know who he is, or how he finds the quiet strength and hope deep down inside to keep him mentally apart from the horrifying prison life.  The story spans about 20-30 years, and we are submitted to a variety of plot turns, colorful characters, and most of all, the inescapable duration of time.  This film teaches not only the characters but the audience about patience.  It is long, but it has to be.  It shows us that every painful and seemingly hopeless turn of events only makes the moments of love and bonding sweeter, truly proving that we have to learn pain before we can appreciate pleasure.  The movie is filmed with that in mind: lowpoints and pitfalls followed by small, temporary redemptions.  But on the grand scale, it is all simply setting the scene for one of the greatest endings EVER put on film.  I won't even give a hint as to what happens, but the last twenty minutes of this film are so good, you'll simply sit there in awe as the credits roll.  It is truly that good.  Keep in mind that the ending would never be as sweet had so much pain not been endured before hand.  But oh that last shot, I'll probably never forget it, and neither will you.  Buy this movie now.  (NOTE: In terms of DVD extras, I think this is pretty thin, basically just the movie...so if you've got it on VHS, you might want to wait for the special edition.  But if you don't have this movie, what are you waiting for?  Order it as soon as possible.)	5.0	One of the Best Ever	2002-04-03	14	13	1

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A24M2KN27MDEXO	bill_the_great	When it was released, The Shawshank Redemption quickly faded out of the theater's and although it was considered for several Academy Awards, it was generally regarded as a bomb, a well-made bomb, but a bomb none-the-less.  But, when it was released on video, word-of-mouth and endless showings on cable began to spread the movie like wildfire, and like the Phoenix rising from the ashes, The Shawshank Redemption has become one of the most beloved films in recent memory.The film starts out as a conventional prison drama: Andy Dufresne, a respected banker on the outside, is convicted of a crime he didn't commit and is sentenced to life in prison at a maximum security penitentiary.  From there, we see how Andy interacts in the harsh environment of prison, climbs his way up the ladder of pison politics and how an unlikely friendship develops between him, &quot;Red&quot; (Morgan Freeman) and an assorted gang of convicted criminals.  Andy's indomitable spirit brings him through his trials while in prison and leads the film to an incredible conclusion that will have you jumping up and down and running around the room.What was initially billed as the film's greatest detriment, its length, actually turns out to be its greatest asset.  In an era of quick MTV-style editing and jump cuts, The Shawshank Redemption's deliberate pacing helps the audience truly bond with the characters and ultimately when the film's many strands come together for its conclusion, the emotional payoff is vastly more satisfying for the viewer.The only significant problem with the film itself is the DVD that it has been packaged in.  If any film is screaming for a special edition DVD, it is certainly this one.  The &quot;extras&quot; are the trailer, production notes and some stills from the director.  Although the present packaging for the DVD is unacceptable for a film of its quality, I have hope that with the 10-year anniversary of the film's release just a year away, Castle Rock is hard at work rectifying the wrong that happened when this sub-par DVD was released.With that small slight aside, I must conclude by saying that if you haven't seen this film yet, just get the DVD anyway!  The film is too good to keep yourself from viewing any longer!  Watch it today!	5.0	A Classic...	2003-11-10	11	10	1

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ARDGJS603WY3P	"blahdigity ""blah"""	The Shawshank Redemption is an awesome movie. The main character Andy Duframe who was a banker doesn't seem like a bright person because of the way he acted when he had his trial. People don't know much about prison, they just know it's bad. This movie showed what the inside of a prison is like, and I haven't seen much movies do that lately. This movie sort of shows that a friend can really be something good to a person, because Red was a good friend to Andy and Andy seem to do fine and keep his sanity even in a prison. It is weird that Red is able to get all the stuff he gets from the outside world, when he's locked up in prison, like the tiny pickaxe and poster he got for Andy. I don't like the warden, because he made Andy still help him even though he shot an inmate that said Andy was innocent. Because of the warden's position, he gets to do whatever he wants with Andy because his position gives him the power. The movie was sad at times, and interesting at other times, like how Andy makes plans for 20 years and not gone insane from it.	5.0	Good Movie	2006-01-03	3	0	3

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1WSQK3SB76RCC	Blake Wood	"Every once in a while, you come across a movie where everything, I mean EVERYTHING works. The story. The casting. The acting. The music. The direction. You become so engrossed in the movie that you lose track of time. You forget everything that was on your mind before the movie started. You go to bed that night thinking about how good that movie was. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of those rare movies.Now, I have come across people who initially resist watching this movie because they don't want to watch a ""prison"" movie. This movie is so much more than that. It is a story of hope; the survival of hope despite all attempts to crush it. When all one has is hope. When hope is all that drives you. When hope is all you have left.Two things always stand out to me the most in this movie. The first is having the always outstanding Morgan Freeman eloquently narrate the story along the way. It is a stroke of pure genius, and it adds so much to the movie. The second thing is the musical score. I am a big fan of movie scores, and how much they enhance the story. It is amazing how much the music of a particular film can impact upon the total movie experience. Well, this is PERFECTION.This is simply one of the best movies ever made, a movie you can watch time and time again. I give it my highest recommendation possible."	5.0	"""Simply put, a masterpiece....."""	2004-11-25	7	4	3

To that end, I wholeheartedly recommend that you purchase it.The special features are numerous and very well done. Don't you hate it when you buy a DVD or Blu Ray, and there are sparse features - or none at all?For me, a specific problem purchasing movies relates to the subtitle options. Spanish and French seem to always be the only options. Even on some Chinese and Japanese movies, there are no options for Chinese or Japanese subtitles! Fortunately, this Blu Ray has Mandarin Chinese (what I was looking for) in addition to Japanese, Portuguese, and yes...Spanish and French.With these language options, the vast majority of the planet can now enjoy this fantastic movie.	5.0	Great Options = Great Blu Ray	2011-02-07	2	2	0

On his arrival, we met Red, the only guilty man in Shawshank, who thinks Andy won't last in Shawshank.When they meet for the first time, Red starts to think differently about him, and the two form a close friendship. Of course, life isn't easy in Shawshank. In his years there, Andy is repeatedly violated by a group of inhumane prisoners, while Red is refused parole over and over.However, while there, they both come to learn a valuable lesson: Men and fear can hold them prisoner, but friendship and hope can set them free. And the ending is just beautiful.This is simply a wonderful movie. The plot is simple, but the music, acting, and filming are amazing.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AB8J8L6AZHWEM	Bradford Van Slooten	This film really perplexes me. With the hundreds of people I have interviewed and the thousands of surveys I have sent out to video store customers, who have seen The Shawshank Redemption, I must say, you either love or hate this film. There seems to be no gray area here.There was obviously some disdain, hate, and indifference at the box office in the fall of 1994. Nobody saw it. Nobody cared to see it. According to Variety magazine, this film grossed domestically a total of $28.6 million and only lasted 9 weeks in the national theaters before it was yanked and shelved for good. For those of you keeping score at home that's an average of $3.17 million a week. That's a joke!!Heck, &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; made over $40 million in it's first day of release. According to Variety magazine, &quot;Mission Impossible II&quot; made $63 million in its first day of national release. Now that's firepower at the Box Office and the only true way to prove the artistic value and quality of a motion picture. Furthermore, that's the only way American audiences keep score!Back to Shawshank. I must be the only person who found middle ground with this movie. It's a good movie, but not nearly a great one. There are a lot of flaws, annoying scenes, and very unrealistic occurrences that just unexplainably happen (a few times I almost wanted to get up and walk out).Here are some of the things that are laughable and flawed in The Shawshank Redemption.1.) Would or would a prison NOT keep a convicted murderer felon locked up at all times; especially in the presence of the prison Warden. EVERY scene Andy is in, he never has handcuffs on. Therefore the ending scene would never have taken place.2.) Would someone please explain to me how they where going to get Rita Heyworth snuck into the prison? This happens to be one of the most ridiculous scenes in movie history and very laughable. When I was in the theater there were well deserved sneers and laughs of sarcasm and contempt. This was the movie theater scene when the inmates are watching the Rita Heyworth movie and Andy sneaks in requesting to have Rita Heyworth.3.) The narration is weak and unjustified. Narration in films are always a sign of weakness in the story and plot. It is always used to cover up holes in the story; unless it conveys the protagonist's inner feelings and thought. Here, it conveys somebody (his friend) who is basically telling us what we are witnessing on the screen. It's like listening to a football play by play announcer describing the action on the field. This does not advance our involvement in the film at all.4.) The acting of Tim Robbins is an embarrassment. He's too wooden and stiff. Furthermore, he mumbles too much in his Brando imitation of &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; and is barely intelligible.5.) It's hard to believe the prison brutality in this film. I find it hard to believe that the Warden's 'right hand man' Hadley, would terrorize the inmates arbitrarily.Here are some of the good things about this film:1.) It's not a bad story and at times inspirational. The dramatic arc is right on target and there are plot surprises.2.) The pacing by the director is very good. The suspenseful buildup is well timed and the scenes snap in place with good tempo and rhythm.  3.) If you can get by the dry, aloof, and uninspired performance by Robbins, you will really like the acting job by Freeman. This is a well rounded, three-dimensional performance by Freeman and he really saves the film's credibility.4.) The villain is believable and more importantly sinister. We wouldn't expect the prison warden to be the villain, but here he is. It's well written and more importantly, played out realistically.5.) The sound engineering is excellent. Put this movie on a 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound System with 14 speakers running at 140 watts with 8 Ohms a peice for the front 5 speakers and 110 watts per channel for your surround speakers into 8 ohms from 20Hz to 20,000Khz with less than 0.07 percent THD and you'll be blown away. Also, try to keep your Digital-to-analog audio converter at 24-bit/96 kHz and your frequency response at (+/- 3 dB): 10 Hz to 100,000KHz to achieve the perfect sound for the DVD's soundtrack.You wouldn't expect a film with plain sets and dull interiors to have exceptional sound, but the sound engineers really pulled off a miracle on this movie. Again, you've got to hear this on a Dolby 5.1, Dolby Pro Logic XDL342, Standard Dolby Digital, or Dolby VMXL38 Logic ACM 283 System.Well, that's all folks. A movie you either love OR hate--could be LOVE TO HATE as so many of you have--but somehow, I found the middle ground and saw the gray lining. Ain't I really objective!	2.0	A Decent  Show, but Something is Missing...	2001-04-02	58	6	52
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AR2T3NOGFNIUH	"Bradford VS ""Bradford V."""	"The Shawshank Redemption came out in 1994 with very little fan fare.  It had it's share of rivals in Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, but I must say with complete humbleness, that this is one of the most underappreciated, underrated, and best films of the modern era of motion pictures.  I think the reason why the movie did little box office was the very odd title of the film and the fact that it is a film about prison.The story written by the horror master, Stephen King, shapes a unique and compelling story with many surprise twists including an ending that shocks and completely catches you off guard.  I read his short story on this movie in his novella, ""Different Seasons"" and King, a master at creating complex characters, reaches out and develops the two main protagonists extremely well.I can't see how a normal and sensible person cannot like this film.  It has everything: great story line, likable characters, a truly evil sinister antagonist, and surprise elements along the way.The movie is so well crafted that you feel you are eavesdropping on the main characters all the time.  For example, when Red finds Andy's treasure and personal note at the end of the film, Red opens up an envelope with a huge amount of cash and looks around as if someone is eavesdropping on him.  It's a poignant yet funny moment that takes the edge off of his discover.See this film.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3S5WYWYKSAI9C	Bradley Olin	Some of the reviews written here, including Amazon.com's editorial review hammer home how important this movie is: the poignant emotions it evokes in viewers, but in terms of how powerful using time in a film to create a real sense of experience can be.  This movie is also the movie that really put Morgan Freeman on the map; he lost Best Actor in a Leading Role by a hair to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump, but ever since has been a household name.  Since most great things have been said already, I will say this:The reason to buy this DVD set is because unlike older versions, this contains the remastered 5.1 mixing, documentaries about the film making, and the director's commentary.  These features were lacking in the first release of the DVD, so if you never bought it or own the first release, it's time to upgrade!  If this movie is nostalgic for you, you'll enjoy seeing the stars reminisce about filming the movie, and what it meant to each of them.  I think this really solidifies the intense emotions this movie produces in viewers, and it definitely adds value to the film.	5.0	Buy this Edition.	2006-12-20	2	2	0

When life isn't fair, when times are tough, when things aren't going our way and we can't seem to make sense of what is happening, our focus tends to be on what is happening NOW; WHY, etc.  Hope causes us to  focus on something (or someone) other than ourselves and then it spills over into the lives of others and that's when anything is possible.  I've heard it said that redemption takes a moment, reclamation of character takes a lifetime.  Our journey in life builds our character.  This movie is about a journey(s).

The performances alone, of all the cast, not just Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, are superb. For me,it is the voice over of Mr Freeman that elevates the different moods and tones over the course of the story. Far from turning this into another jail break fiasco, we are left to wonder at the endurance of the human spirit and grieve at its frailty. There is no glorification of the physical violence, no homage to the &quot;tough guy&quot; routine, offered - rather a slow subtle appreciation for the ability to survive and to adapt to a hostile environment. Morgan Freeman's closing soliloquy of &quot;I hope........&quot; is not the atypical Hollywood triumphant ending but, a considered dose of reality.

This is by far among the greatest masterpeices in the history of film.  From the beginning moments of Andy contemplating murder  in his car, to the final glorious reunion in Zawantaneo (is that right?),  this film moved me.  I experienced the gamut of emotions.The  characters were brilliant and alive, as well as the cinematography and  music.  The original score, similar to those done by John Williams (Star  Wars, Indiana Jones), added to the suspense and energy.I must admit that  I am not a big Tim Robbins Fan, but his performance in this film was more  than sufficient, and Morgan Freeman blew me away as usual.

Morgan Freeman is outstanding as always, and puts on a great performance in this movie. Tim Robbins, who plays Andy Dufresne, a man wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, really makes the viewer gain a larger appreciation for their own life. Lines such as &quot;Get busy living or get busy dying&quot; serve as a backbone for this movie about one mans struggle for freedom. In the movie, Andy Dufresne always remains hopeful, which is the sole reason he survives in Shawshank prison. The ending is spectacular, which is expected from the mind of Stephen King, the man who originally wrote the short story &quot;Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption&quot;. Thios movie has changed my life forever, and hopefully,will do the same for many others. Unfortunately, five stars was the highest rating i could give it.	5.0	Briliant Work of Art	2001-06-15	1	0	1

I could  not wait until this  movie was released on DVD and bought  it immediately.  When it was released on  Blu Ray I bought it immediately.  The difference between the DVD and Blu Ray is great!  Some scenes  that  look the best are when Morgan Freeman in in the  hay field in Buxton.  The colours are incredible.  The close ups of Red and  Andy are crystal clear and every great character  mark you can see.  If you are not sure if you want to upgrade, let me just say it is well  worth it.  I have  watched this movie many times, and again tonight.  This movie just gets better and better with each viewing.  The bonus features on the blu ray are a carry over from the  two disc DVD but great to have.  I  could go on and on about this movie, and to those that say they do not understand why this movie is so well  loved, well, sorry, you must not be fortunate to appreciate such a masterpiece.  If you have never seen this movie, you are in for a real  treat. So nice to see that you DO NOT NEED 3D, car crashers, monsters, rock sound track, all the trapping of so many crappy movies that are around  today.  Well, put in the blu ray, sit back and enjoy......	5.0	Still on of my ALL TIME FAVOURITE MOVIES EVER!!!!!!	2011-08-22	1	1	0

This movie is one of those messengers. The message of hope contained in one of the final scenes where Andy says to Red &quot;that I guess it just gets down to one thing. You either get busy living, or get busy dying,&quot; is a reminder that no matter what life hands us, we and only we, are the ones that choose to keep growing, or to give up.

Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrail of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it.

Bassett ""slkdjf"""	First of all, I hardly ever watch rated R movies, and would have eliminated this movie entirely on that fact had I not read other reviews. The reasons it was rated R, I believe, are some of the themes may be considered graphic, but for the most part, they did not show them. The insinuation itself may have been what made the rating go from PG-13 to R. I've watched many PG-13 movies that I would consider far more graphic, sexual, or violent than this one, and this one did not warrant an R rating on any of those grounds stand alone, much less together. But, they have their reasons for the rating, so I will leave it at that. I watched this with my teenage boys, and they loved it. The reaction to injustices, and the internal motivations to overcome the present, and the standing ground on good morals when the world around you is not, are the lessons that can be learned by kids watching this movie. Virtue regardless of circumstances, I believe, is the message that is very well said.	5.0	Unconditional virtue	2013-12-05	1	1	0

You probably don't need to be convinced that this is one of the most moving and effective adaptations from a book to film ever made. You also know that each role is exceptionally well-cast and well-acted. You already want the movie for the movie's sake.What you don't know is why you should buy the DVD vs. VHS vs. renting. I have both the VHS and DVD. The VHS gave me the movie, so does the DVD offer enough more to warrant the additional purchase?  Probably not. The DVD provides a wide-screen view, alternate language tracks, a photo gallery of stills taken during the shoot (nothing exciting here), short Bios of maybe 4-5 of the major players (Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, director, etc), and trailer.  No additional/deleted scenes or commentary by anyone. If you want the wide screen feel, go for the DVD.  If you just want to play the movie on demand, the VHS is fine. Owning both versions is redundant.	4.0	The movie is great -- how about the DVD?	2002-08-21	5	5	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1Q329PGKOGLDD	Chad Spivak	The Shawshank Redemption is by far, one of the greatest movies of all time.  It is ultimate story of how hope truly never dies, and how good things finally happen to good people.Tim Robbins, in his finest acting  job to date, plays the wrongly convicted Andrew Dufresne.  He is sent to  Shawshank Prison for killing his wife and her lover, and there he meets  Red, played by the ever talented (and one of the best voice-over voices of  all time) Morgan Freeman.  The chemistry between the two is so amazing  throughout the entire movie, and you can clearly see it flow.You really  begin to feel for Andy and his quiet demeanor peppered with subtle  emotions.  Just when you think the movie is going a certain way, the plot  takes an incredible turn that leaves you sitting there with your mouth  open.  From this point, just when you think the film is heading towards its  almost certain climax, it twists another way, leaving you sitting there,  not being able to control your giddy smile.The film is wonderfully  written, and the actors were superb.  It has a beautiful flow to it, and  you can't help but enjoy the masterpiece that you are viewing.  You will  definately be pleasantly satisfied.

Nominated for 7 Academy Awards this movie has a produced real cult following..(just Google it!!)

That has not always been true for WMP in Vista and XP. Required codecs had to be purchased or pirated and that really stunk IMHO. I met Morgan Freeman in 2003 in Clarksdale,MS at an art gallery grand opening and thanked him for sharing his talent with the world. He was as regular a guy as you or I and a very cordial gentleman. He is also part owner of the Ground Zero Blues Club there in Clarksdale. A great talent and a great guy as comfortable to be around as an old shoe. This is the- #1 BEST PRISON MOVIE EVER -  There is some graphic violence , graphic language and potentially offensive homosexual content FYI  Which is EXACTLY the way prison really is (I know.)You will love this movie , you'll never tire of it, you'll gift it to your friends (like I have done)and you'll be riveted from the very opening scene.

And having watched it a few times every year since 1997, I can safely attest to the fact that it only gets better with each viewing--so much so that I can't help but want everyone around me to revel in the experience as well.  Now with the release of this glorious 10th anniversary edition DVD, my dream has finally been realized.  ""Shawshank"" has recently been recognized as *the* most overlooked film of all time (eat that, ""Forrest Gump""!), and that exact feeling of triumph resonates throughout the many satisfying special features on Disc 2.  So please, buy this DVD, sit back, and enjoy.  And don't forget to coerce everyone around you to watch it too!"	5.0	Share This Movie with 5 People or You'll Be Unlucky in Love	2004-12-04	7	4	3
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A396SBGKAOLTZE	Chris Aldridge	It deserves ten stars. Its beauty lies in its slow, sublime, style- that thing that usually turns off so many moviegoers. But the whole premise of life inside a prison cell (especially when one is innocent) makes better sense when told in a calm, emotion-building, pace such as this. Otherwise, one would never get to know Tim Robbins's quiet banker-accountant (and what makes him appear alternately shy, snooty, and suicidal all at the same time); or Morgan Freeman's equally quiet, cynical, and genial lifer- not to mention how he's &quot;a man who knows how to get things.&quot; I love what the film *doesn't* do: it doesn't make an issue of its two leads being different races (although one could claim that factor makes their friendship all the more marvelous to watch), it doesn't pull any sensational, far-out, action punches (as films with an all-male cast often do), and it dosen't freeze its characters into 'types.' Everyone is real, and everyone is flawed- from James Whitmore's 'Birdman-like' veteran to Bob Gunton's pretentious, icy, warden. But the finish (which really starts around the film's last twenty minutes) is one of the most powerful, sublime, and moving things ever committed to celluloid. Get it in either format.	5.0	&quot;Slowness is beauty.&quot; Who said that?!!	2002-10-29	8	6	2

It has been my favorite for a decade and will probably remain as such for a decade longer....or more.My only beef with this set is this - the extras are disappointing. What you get is three features, none of which are longer than an hour, all of which amount to the principals hamming for the camera, talking about what a wonderful film 'Shawshank' is and what an honor is was to be involved. The 'Charlie Rose' show included here, featuring Freeman, Darabont and Robbins, is the most informative about the production, but its hard to sit through four guys gabbing about a movie for an hour.That said, Darabont does a wonderful job with his commentary. However, it was NOT worth paying 18 bucks to replace my old version of Shawshank. The transfer DOES seems cleaner than my old DVD, but not 18 bucks cleaner.Personally, i would have liked a more in-depth ""making-of"" featurette.

It's like Stir Crazy, but without Gene Wilder.""  And, I'm sorry, but Gene Wilder is great in that movie.  Stir Crazy, that is--not Shawshank Redemption, which he is not in.If you haven't seen Shawshank Redemption, don't bother.  Here's the story: two criminals are in prison in the 1960s and they become friends while they're in jail.  The end.  Sorry you just wasted your time and money, folks.  Not to sound like a broken record, but does that sound like a better story than say this one: A married man is tempted by an alluring woman in red, and practically throws his life away as his obsession with her grows.  That movie is called Woman in Red.  Now, which one sounds more interesting to you?Meanwhile, back in prison, the two gentleman played by Morgan Freeman (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) and Tim Robbins (Cadillac Man) plan to break out of jail, but their plans are doomed.  That part starts to get interesting, until you realize that this is just another way that Hollywood glamorizes prison life and why should we be rooting for prisoners to break out of jail anyway?  If there were a movie about Jeffrey Dahmer and Charles Manson becoming friends and then they try to break out of prison, I would not be cheering them on.  That's what so hypocritical about the media, these days!I won't ruin the ending where someone important is dead, but I will say that I have no idea why people get so involved in a movie like this that pales in comparison to, say, a movie with real action like ""The Rock"" or ""Silver Streak.""If you see The Shawshank Redemption, just remember that it is going to be a disappointment and you'll probably feel depressed about your life for weeks to come."	1.0	The Badshank Redemption	2007-04-13	223	11	212

In the beginning, there were a couple of dark scenes where the video was distorted.  Throughout the movie, I was more pleased with the video, and am satisfied with this Blu-Ray purchase.  The video wasn't great, but it was pretty good.  I give it a 7.5 to 8.0 on a 10 point scale.The audio began in Dolby Digital 5.1, instead of Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  I had to open the menu to change it, and that wasn't easy.  I didn't know how I did it at the time, but I managed to change it to TrueHD, but I accidently turned on the English sub-titles.  I then figured out the system for changing the audio and sub-titles.  The letters were blue, with your selection being a slightly lighter shade of blue.  This is hardly noticable.  The selected audio and sub-title could have been red, or some other color to make it easier.	5.0	Good Video and Audio, But Not Great	2011-05-17	1	0	1

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AS558SNWF1DXG	Clare Quilty	"Has there been a mainstream movie in the past 10 years that wraps itself up as movingly and satisfyingly as ""The Shawshank Redemption"" ? If so, let me know about it because I don't think I've seen it.After years of being available only on a ho-hum DVD with no extras, ""Shawshank"" finally gets the double-disc treatment.  The movie - in which Tim Robbins plays a convict who, over the course of decades, seeks an elaborate revenge - was a flop when released in 1994. Now it's a popular favorite that holds the No. 2 spot on the Internet Movie Database's Top 250 movies. It's just a good, old-fashioned yarn.Unknown screenwriter Frank Darabont adapted Stephen King's short novel, ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" into a script that was so sought-after that he was able to demand the right to direct it, and this is an excellent book-to-movie translation. In fact, the few moments when ""Shawshank"" doesn't quite work are when Darabont injects scenes that weren't in the novel - when every tough guy in the prison-yard is struck speechless by the sound of Mozart, for example, or when the elderly prisoner Brooks makes his somewhat tear-jerky re-entry into society.Critics of the movie claim it's often sappy and, at times, maybe so, but it has the kind of sap that makes movies entertaining, it's the kind of earnestness that's just too much trouble to resist.Critics also claim it's too long but, at 142 minutes, I think it's just right. Constant TV broadcasts of the film disguise the fact that this is a story about patience.  Patience tends to chafe against commercial breaks and TNT's habit of using pop-ups to remind you that, say, ""Law & Order"" is coming on next.Patience is also what makes ""Shawshank"" a slow-burning, engrossing fuse for the first two hours, and the final act a series of beautifully timed storytelling explosions - the Raquel Welch poster, the drain, the rain, the shoes, the bank, the final hearing, a box under a rock and one beautiful beach."	4.0	The kind of movie people go to the movies hoping to see.	2004-10-21	6	6	0

Every once in awhile, a film comes along that defies explanation, that you can't really pinpoint why everyone loves it so much, you just do. And that that film comes out and is praised to death despite having either low box office return, unknown stars or an extended length. Well among all the teen gross out comedies, teen romances and just convuluted messy and totally unneccessary films, Shawshank towers over them all.Tim Robbins plays Andy, an intelligent banker who is convicted of killing his wife and lover, he's sent to Shawshank Prison. Despite having rather brutal guards and gay men who keep assaulting him, Andy becomes very likable due to his intelligence. He does the guards tax returns and financial advice, gets a big library rather than the 2 shelves they used to have and in one scene, actually let's people listen to a song from the speakers for the first time. He also befriends Red, a kind of convenience store man who can get anything. Over the course of 20 years, we see Andy and Red going through Shawshank and how to have resilience even at it's worst.All this leads up to one incredibly satisfying ending which benefits from a seemingly long film and great acting, this is a very good film to buy, yes I said buy, don't rent this.

I should also say this was a movie adapted from the book &quot;Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption&quot;, written by Stephen King.  King is an incredible story teller.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3OEECMCM2T4KQ	C. Middleton	"Once in a while a film emerges that goes beyond the mainstream, though manages to touch many hearts and minds. These films somehow give us hope, inspiration and a reason to carry on despite the obstacles thrown unremittingly across our paths. They show us that the human being is capable of enduring great suffering yet can push through this suffering and shine like never before. The Shawshank Redemption is one such film.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) has been tried and found guilty for the murder of his wife and her lover. His sentence is two life terms and is sent to Shawshank prison to do his time. Andy is innocent though he seems to take this disaster in stride. Andy is an unusual character. He is a man of great intelligence and patience, a man with a basic goodness that shines forth despite the horrors that befall him. He is a man of great humanity and never ever loses hope because he holds fast to those simple aspects in life that define our humanity. In the scene where he risks his life to help the sadistic Captain of the guard (Clancy Brown) by showing him how he can avoid being taxed with his inheritance, all Dufresne asks for in return is two cold beers for each of his ""work associates"". Why does he do such a thing? Red (Morgan Freeman) comes to the conclusion that the act simply made him and his fellow prisoners feel more human. And that's exactly what happened.Morgan Freeman as Red narrates the story about Andy and their relationship with an almost undefinable heart. I truly believe Freeman is one of the best ""voice-overs"" in cinematic history. His resonate and wise voice pulls the viewer into the tale making the story feel real and significant. Freeman makes us listen because what he's saying is true and we hold on to every word because we know we'll learn something. Morgan Freeman is one of our greatest actors.Taken from a novella by Stephen King, ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"", director and writer, Frank Derabont, also the screenwriter of The Green Mile, ensured the film was carried by the acting and nothing else. The soundtrack is beautiful, but it is Robbins and Freeman, including the entire cast, that makes this film an extraordinary one.As has been written and said many times almost too numerous to mention, The Shawshank Redemption is about hope, it also is about friendship, patience and endurance. In this round, somehow, against all odds to the contrary, good triumphs over evil. And it is done with such flair, elegance and real justice, that most of us coming away from the tale are left almost dumbfounded: how did Andy do it?These are good men in appalling conditions, where most would fall and become part of the evil. Here is a story about a man who holds fast to his integrity, cares about his friends and pushes against unspeakable conditions to, at last, come through to the other side with his humanity in tact.The Shawshank Redemption is a remarkable film."	5.0	When Good Triumphs over Unspeakable Odds	2006-06-15	6	6	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2GCHG6U8HTVIT	C. O. DeRiemer	I've always thought this movie, while it has some very good parts, is awfully sentimental, manipulative and way too long. Any number of the set pieces...Andy's rapes, the teaching and then death of the young inmate, the income tax help, the old con, etc...could have been edited down or, in some cases, eliminated. Morgan Freeman seems to have a lock on roles calling for weary wisdom and humanity. His voice over, it seems to me, continuously punches home messages that don't need to be punched home. His last testimony before the parole board struck me as just more manipulation of the audience. This is no criticism of Freeman, but it is of the script. (If you want to see just how effective Freeman can be, this time as a bad guy, check him out as Fast Black in a movie called Street Smart. He plays a charismatic and vicious pimp.) The whole James Whitmore stuff seemed to me to be padding.On the other hand, the beating of the new inmate quickly established the kind of place the prison was, and did so efficiently and brutally. The atmosphere of the movie was first rate. Tim Robbins was excellent. He was likeable, intelligent and sly. Best of all, in my view, was Bob Gunton as the warden. This guy walked off with every scene he was in, even those he shared with Robbins.The movie was based on two of King's short stories, and it has always felt to me like a short story that's been padded out to make a long novel. Four stars is generous, but the movie is better than three.	4.0	Well Made, But a Movie I Don't Respond To	2004-10-07	14	3	11

I didn't think much about it till I was out shopping the next month or so and the video of the Shawshank redemption was on special at a very low price, so I bought it.  It wasn't really meant for me, but for my dad who likes those dramatic-jailbreak movies.  That night everyone was out doing something, so I decided to watch it.First off, I cannot watch a full movie by myself as I tend to wander off and do something else without even realising it.Secondly I really didn't like what I assumed was &quot;this kind of movie&quot;.Well I watched it right through and cried too!  I love this movie and I have forced my entire family to watch it over and over again.  My younger sister thinks it's close to torture but since she is only a 11 year old, it's taken like water off a ducks back.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A39MZQOBI2992A	Craptacular	"This movie always keeps you on the edge of your seat and your heart beating. In the beginning, one could describe Tim Robins character as a confused puppy dog in a big doghouse filled with pit bulls. Andy{tim robbins} in the begining has a quiet and paranoide sort of character. Almost everyone could be considered a antagonist to him. As time goes by, he begins to get some friends like Red{morgan freeman}, Tommy{Gil Bellows},Heywood{William Sadler}, and a few other guys. Yet through the entire movie, he keeps a few antagonists, like Warden Norton{Bob Gunton},Captain Byron T. Hadley{Clancy Brown}, and a gang of guys that are always beating up on Andy. The moment Andy got into Shawshank, he wanted to get out. He created a strong enough relationship with Red, that he could get stuff ""smuggled"" to him from other guys in the prison. Things like a small hammer, posters for enjoyment and to cover up the giant hole he made in the wall. Near the end of the movie Andy tells something to Red that changes the movie a little bit that makes the audience get on the edge of there seat. Andy wanted to have Red stay with him in Mexico when he broke out, but first he would have to find an igneous rock in a field under a tree. Under the rock would be the way that Red could get to where Andy was. In this movie, the guards mostly have a power theory affect on the prisoners. They have created a certain pathos in the prisoners. This pathos would be harsh beatings, death, or very harsh work. The warden also has created a pathos in the prisoners as well. He has a nice side, but if you mess with him, its not good for you {the prisoners}. i would be this movie 4-4.5 stars out of 5. Its a cool movie that should only be seen by people High School and up."	4.0	shawshanker redemtion review	2005-12-31	7	1	6

We never find out if he really did it, but personally i think he didn't. He is sentenced to life at Shawshank prison in the new england area. The time of the story is from the early 1950's - late 1960's. He meets a man named simply as Red ( played by Morgan Freeman ) who helps him out and becomes close friends with Andy. After serving almost 20 years of his sentence Andy tunnels through the walls to freedom and lives his dream of living next to the Pacific Ocean. Red soon comes up for parole and Andy leaves him some money and a letter at a secret spot to let him know that he would like his help starting a business on the west coast.	5.0	A Masterpiece	2000-12-14	3	1	2

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2QKT4SY29TPTX	Cygnet	The Shawshank Redemption seems to be a very popular movie in China.  I get the impression it is shown to high school students who are studying English.  It is a story of hope, friendship, and loyalty.  Students quote Andy's line about &#34;Hope is a good thing ...&#34;  For this reason I would give the movie 5 stars.  However, because the prison language used is, realistically, so strong, I can only give it 4 stars - it's a personal hang-up; the f____ word really bothers me (even more than the adult themes).  Actually, I first watched the movie years ago; I remembered the story; I did not remember the strong language.  That says something about the meaningfulness of the film.  This is not a children's movie.  It is an excellent movie for grown-ups.	4.0	Hopeful	2014-03-08	0	0	0

Stephen Kings masterpiece transended to the film version a terrific cast which fielded a great uplifting story. Andy Dufrane ( Tim Robbins )  was the by most standards a middle class sucess story until his life was turned upsidedown by a cruel twist of fate. The twist is that the redemption so much sought after by the viewer turns out to be something other than Andy's freedom. The story actually chronicles the transformation of life time inmate &quot;Red&quot; played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman. The political line within the corrections facility plays out in true to the audience and enables the viewer to keep cheering for the underdog, no matter what the senerios. The story is fantastic and solidified with well chosen actors. It's a movie with an &quot;edge of your seat&quot; flavour and it delivers the true meaning of HOPE.

Warden Norton is cast as a fundamentalist Christian who issues Bibles to every incoming prisoner, quotes Scripture, whistles ""A Mighty Fortress is Our God,"" and who otherwise is a sadist. So, we root for the criminal inmates against the ""good"" government prison that tries, unsuccessfully, to dehumanize them.

Words cannot describe what I have just seen because it is simply too powerful. The movie is about two men who met in prison. That is as far as I can say because I do not want to waste the elegance of this movie on a stupid summary for you, so see it for yourself. After some research, it's a wonder to why this movie had not won any awards and Forrest Gump was the one to win it all back in 1994, especially when Shawshank Redemption is by no contest and by far better in every aspect.I avoided this film all these years after numerously hearing it was good, simply because the title and front cover of the movie looked boring. Shawshank Redemption was opposite of that, I do not believe I will ever find another movie as beautiful as this, that is why I say it is the best movie that I have seen ever. I normally do not say something is the best ever because I will always experience new things and something will always surpass one thing. Impressed beyond my ability to describe the film, Shawshank Redemption is one thing that cannot be surpassed.The connection that I felt between the characters were strong and powerful. The one thing this movie shows and talk about is hope, it reminds me of a video I made for my multimedia class back in high school. The video's message was about hope and contains a poem about it.I have seen plenty of grade A movies, The Godfather, Goodfellas, American History X, Cidade De Deus, Pulp Fiction, etc. But nothing I have seen has come near to holding up it's beauty when in comparison with Shawshank Redemption. Maybe it's just me, maybe I have some personal attachment to the movie that others may not have. But it's hard to believe so because I know a good movie when I see a good movie.Once again, if you have not seen this, it is highly recommended and it is the number one movie that I recommend to watch before you die. The sooner you see it, the better. I've seen many people wrote Shawshank Redemption is highly overrated and is just another good movie. I can not find another way to disagree more, Shawshank Redemption is a superb movie that tells a unforgettable story of friendship, struggle, and hope. One of the few movies to cry to after seeing, it is too beautifully made and you know that no movie will ever be the same again.""Get busy living, or get busy dying"".""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies""."	5.0	"""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies""."	2009-06-14	0	0	0

I especially liked the part where the warden finds out the bible carried Andy's escape tool.  I couldn't stop laughing!  It's not quite as good as Con Air but it is very entertaining.The only part of the movie that seemed far-fetched, was the part where Andy plays the record with the Italian ladies singing.  Come on!  He should have played Elvis or something like that.  I mean, hardened convicts listening to opera music and liking it?  Yeah, right.  They would sooner tap spoons on their cell bars than hear that noise.Still, a good movie.  Ranks right up there with Escape from L.A.  This one could be a keeper.  Yeah, man!  Gotta go.

Two disc Edition) is that the extra features allow insight into the making of the films and into some of the meaning and intent behind the film.	5.0	Sahwshank Redemption 10th year anniversary edition	2013-01-09	0	0	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A19B6IN2VWHDXZ	Dave Thomer	This is such a well-done movie I don't know where to start.  The story is so carefully laid out that every turn first surprises you, then has you saying, &quot;Of course!&quot;  The themes of hope, redemption and freedom are so well-explored that I still can't watch the nding without getting choked up.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are absolutely superb, nowhere more than in the scene where Robbins as Andy Dufresne delivers the line that I really ought to get emblazoned somewhere where I'll see it every day -- &quot;It comes down to a simple choice; you can get busy living, or get busy dying.&quot;The cinematography and editing of this film are absolutely terrific, as is the score, the production design, the lighting, and so on.  It's as beautiful as film to watch as it is a beautiful story to experience.  So I'm disappointed there aren't more extras on the DVD, because I would have liked to learn a bit more about the process of putting it all together.  Maybe Darabont figured he had said all he needed to say in the book version of the screenplay, which I highly recommend.  But the movie itself is so worth seeing I guess the omission of extras is forgivable.	5.0	Great Story, Great Characters -- Great Movie	2001-03-03	1	1	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"Judging by the volume of reviews for ""The Shawshank Redemption"" there probably isn't much more to say other than that this is a great landmark film.  I'm going to use this forum to sing the praises of Morgan Freeman because this film is his greatest accomplishment in an impressive film career.  As good as the ensemble of actors employed here Freeman's Red is the glue that holds the whole enterprise together.  This performance is the difference between a very good film and a great one.  I remember when Siskel and Ebert were doing their Oscar show back in 1995, I can't remember which, but one selected Freeman as best actor and the other picked Tom Hanks for ""Forrest Gump"" the logic being that Freeman had the less showy but no less powerful role while Hanks performed more mannerly.  As time goes on, Freeman's role eclipses Hanks but that's not how the Academy saw it at the time.  This year Freeman is nominated for the Oscar again for his role in ""Million Dollar Baby"".  I hope he gets it.  I watched the Golden Globes and it broke my heart to see Clive Owen beat Freeman for his part in ""Closer"".  Owen was very good but when you take the track record into account Freeman is long overdue for the gold statuette."	5.0	Freeman's Shining Moment	2005-01-29	4	4	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	Falsely given a life sentence for the murder of his wife, bank manager Andy DuFresne (Tim Robbins) befriends fellow lifer Red Redding (Morgan Freeman) and astounds his fellow inmates with his resilency and sense of self-worth.  His financial skills also make him useful to the prison staff; soon he is acting as a financial advisor to the guards and helping the warden keep track of his illicit gains.The film unfolds at a leisurely pace, as befits a story about men who are serving life sentences.  Director/screenwriter Frank Darabont does a good job of presenting the monotony of prison life without allowing the film itself to become boring by punctuating the story with little emotional payoffs along the way.  Although many of these payoffs are rather conventional movie feel-good moments, I still appreciated the fine work done by the cast and the satisfying albeit predictable conclusion./	4.0	Predictable, but enjoyable	2003-07-13	3	0	3

The opening fly-by shot of the bus arriving at Shawshank is a classic piece of cinemaphotography. Even the score is magnificent.But I'm baffled by the editorial review by Jeff Shannon (above). Specifically, when Shannon writes &quot;we realize there's reason to believe the banker's crime was justifiable,&quot; what on earth is he talking about?!?Just for starters, the banker didn't commit the crime.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ	David M. Lovin	The plot of this film does not sound promising. Two guys become close friends while sharing time in a prison for twenty years. It is also very long, clocking in at around 2 hours 20 minutes. However, this is quite possibly the most enjoyable movie I have ever seen, with great characters and super pacing leading to a wonderful surprise ending.This movie lost the best picture Oscar in 1994 to Forrest Gump. While Tom Hanks deserved the best Actor award that year, that movie was no where near as good as this one. Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a Maine Banker who is falsly convicted of the double murder of his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison for two life sentences, one for each victim.Early in his stay, he meets &quot;Red&quot; (Morgan Freeman) who has already logged twenty years there and is turned down for parole when we first meet him. Red is the man who has the connections to get anything the prisoners want, for a price. He actually has no respect for Andy when he first sees him, but eventually they become very close.The movie is fantastic in the way it sets up the personalities of the various characters in just a few scenes. Both the warden and the head guard are extremely evil men, yet we don't see them more than in just a few scenes. Their characters are established early and we grow to hate them almost immediately.The ending has several parts and it is great. It may be one of the most complete surprise endings ever, several strands in the story seem to come together at once. Should have been best picture.	5.0	Get busy livin, or get busy dying	2004-02-03	0	0	0

No matter; there are many people that I know (myself and my wife included) who rate this as their all-time favorite movie.  We have watched it at least 25 times; it is constantly on television and whenever it is on, we inevitably watch it to its astounding conclusion.  As others have said, the ending can be watched repeatedly, ad infinitum, and not lose any lustre.  The cinematography, dialogue, acting, tempo, narration by Morgan Freeman, etc are peerless.  This movie incorporates may of life's lessons; indeed, it is a metaphor for life.  Hope is a good thing; maybe the best of things.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A35K84RT618N3A	David Robson	The Shawshank Redemption is a character study in which the audience can develop a healthy and well-earned respect for a man whose spirit will not be crushed. We get to know these people, and writer and first-time director  Frank Darabont is able to make us care for them in a way that makes the  relatively slow pace of the film more than bearable.  Shawshank  transcends its genre much the way Cool Hand Luke did all those years ago,  but while Paul Newman's Luke was a smiling, hardened con, with a longing  for escape, Robbins, in a superb performance, makes Andy's intellect and  imagination his salvation.  It's a beautiful film that is able to  portray the power of hope through the eyes of a  rich and rewarding  character. A man brutalized but not beaten by a corrupt system.	5.0	Superlative Shawshank	1999-12-12	18	17	1

The twists and turns are truly amazing, and the ending will leave you breathless.The quality on the DVD is superb, and they even fixed a goof at the end of the film, regarding the placement of a ""wound"", just for this DVD release. There are some great extras such as commentaries, behind the scenes documentaries, a 20 minute spoof of the movie, trailers, and some other things that make this set well worth the money.I cannot stress how great this movie is, and how it's a *must own* for anyone looking to start a respectable DVD collection."	5.0	If I could only watch one movie for the rest of my life, this would be it.	2006-08-03	6	6	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ABN5K7K1TM1QA	Dennis Littrell	"At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the ""only"" guilty man at Shawshank prison.  He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win.  (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.)  What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement.  Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone.  Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover.  Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays.  It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing.  I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy.  I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed.  They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R).  On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words ""His judgment cometh and that right soon.""  The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect.  You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you.  As most people know, it was adapted  from a novella by Stephen King entitled ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.""  Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell.  The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford.  We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears.  If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie.  She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955).  It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs.  Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966).  In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story.  There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with life on the outside and hangs himself.  Playing off of this is Red's periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED.  Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent.  The editing superb: there's not a single dead spot in the whole movie.  The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the ""sisters,"" etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the ""redemption"" is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out.  But never mind.  We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul.  It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement.  It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The Godfather) at the IMDb.  Don't miss it."	5.0	Great story, wondrously told and acted	2004-05-20	18	15	3

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A13PPQ2GI1IJYM	DESERTMAN40	The Shawshank Redemption is a classic film and probably one of the best film of all time with a message of hope and inspiration to everyone.The movie tells a poignant story of Andy Dufresne,a wrongly convicted killer who was sent for two life sentences to Shawshank Prison at Maine.It tells us on how Andy lived inside the prison walls,being raped from time to time by convicted homosexuals felons,his friendship with Red,having a sense of hope despite of his seemly hopeless situation,making the most of his life by using his accounting skills by helping the guards in their income tax and cleaning the warden's dirty money and to finally escaping from prison through a hole in the wall hidden under poster of women such as Rita Hayworth and Rachel Welsh.Great acting especially by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.Direction was superb by first time director Frank Darabont.The musical score was also good.It will truly be enjoyed by anybody who love great films and those who wants films that can truly uplift the human spirit.While writing this review,I just read that Bob Gunton,who played Warden Norton, stated in Wall Street Journal that he still receives &#34;substantial checks&#34; from it after 20 years when it was first released.This only shows that it still holds up to present time and it will definitely be a this movie will be talked about for the next 20 to 50 or more years just like Judy Garland's film,The Wizard Of Oz and Gone With The Wind.	5.0	A Classic Film About Hope And Redemption	2014-05-25	0	0	0

Absolutely first class acting from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in this emotional roller coaster ride through prison life filmed on location at Shawshank prison.  The narration by Morgan Freeman is a spot of brilliance by Director Frank Darabont and sets this apart from other similar movies such as the Green Mile.  This is a movie about the resilience of the human spirit in the face of cruel odds.  Its difficult to watch at times and the viewer is bombarded with the whole range of human emotions.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A5P4JIH5SJH3U	D. Ian Crutchley	"First off, this reviewer regularly rates this movie as his personal favourite of all time. Why only four stars then? Because we are asked to rate the DVD, not the movie, and the criminal lack of DVD extras for one of the best films ever made is shameful. So, film five stars, DVD three - averaging out at 4. Maths lesson over, on with the review.Based on the Stephen King novella ' Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption ' this really has become a modern day classic. Other films have grossed more, and may have a more immediate following, but Shawshank will endure for years, and become another 'Casablanca ' loved by generations to come.The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, sent to the maximum security prison of Shawshank for the murder of his wife and her lover. Played with an under-stated intelligence by Tim Robbins in a career defining turn, and supported by sterling performances from Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, and veteran James Whitmore. Morgan Freeman's work is particularly notable, not just for his performance ( let's face it, the man doesn't know how to give a bad one! ) but also for the fact that his is the voice of the film. His chocolate-rich tones were director Frank Darabont's choice for the voice-over of the film, as if his character Red is talking to us, and explaining the sub-text of the film. Voice overs often dont work ( Blade Runner being a prime example ) but this one does, perfectly.Beginning at a slow pace, the film begins with the brutal de-humanising regime meted out to the 'Fresh Fish' as they begin their incarcaration in Shawshank. I remember suggesting my wife watch the film after I'd seen it, and she, being of a considerably more sensitive nature than me, found the early scenes difficult. If you too find the opening 45 minutes a tad heavy going, stick with it - the reward is worth it.Eventually as we progress through the film, we see how Red's initial suspicion of Andy becomes a deep respect, and eventually a deep friendship, indeed it would be true to say that these two men love each other like brothers by the end. There are a few key scenes that really stick in the memory - the rooftop scene, the opera aria scene, the exam result scene - all of which enable us to begin to like these men, men we probably wouldn't have wanted in our homes before the film, but who we'd happily sit down to dinner with after.The film's true emotional impact of course comes in the final third as we learn the truth about Andy's guilt or otherwise. True to many of King's works, there is a twist in the end which leaves us all stunned, and with a big stupid grin on our faces. The total and utter defeat of the dark forces in the film is accomplished with such applomb that you find yourself rooting for the bad guys  - the prisoners, a bunch of murderers and misfits that two hours earlier you were deeply suspicious of. Indeed the last section of the film plays almost totally without our hero, and remains almost my favourite portion of it. By this time we are crying out for the final fulfilment of our hopes for the characters. It is to Frank Darabont's eternal credit that he accomplishes this in a scene without dialogue, and a sweeping panoramic withdrawl from the characters, leaving us with not a dry eye in the house, and a feel-good glow that lasts for days.... while in [a local store] I noticed this man and wife trying to decide which DVD they would buy to view that evening. I pointed to Shawshank. ""Ever seen this one?""""No""""Trust me"" I said, ""It's the best movie you've never seen."" He bought it, and I like to think I made that man and wife cry, laugh and smile that evening.To conclude, Warner Bros and Castle Rock - SHAME ON YOU! This movie deserves better. The Region 2 version rocks, so get busy, re-package, and give us fans the extras this classic deserves!P.S. The ten-year anniversary edition has righted many wrongs. The film has finally been done justice. I watched it again the other night, and again my eyes welled up at the end. Either I am a wus, or I'm right, or maybe both!

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AZNU9AL6ADJLI	"D. Mcmillen ""kingricefan"""	The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that every film buff should see at least once. Even though the setting is a prison from the early part of the 20th century, it is one of the most uplifting movie experiences that you will ever have! This is the story about a convicted man (Tim Robbins) who is sent to Shawshank Prison and meets Red (Morgan Freeman)- a man who can get you pretty much anything you desire. This is also a story of hope and what it can do to a man who is locked up for life and how he changes things (and people) while incarcerated. You have to see this film at least twice to appreciate the fine acting done by Robbins and Freeman, and to see how their friendship developes and changes over time. Every actor in this film does an excellant job in their portrayals. The film is directed by Frank Darabont (who also directed The Green Mile) and he has done an awesome job of taking this novella written by Stephen King (yes, that Stephen King!) and turning it into a beautiful and timeless film. The music score is fantastic, perfect for this type of film. I highly recommend this film to everyone who can appreciate a film that has substance, will stick with you long after you've seen it and make you want to watch it again!	5.0	A 'Must-see' Movie for everyone!	2013-01-09	1	1	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A11PTCZ2FM2547	"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here"""	"I wish I wouldn't let my personal disdain for Tim Robbins continue to get in the way.  It was the main reason I stayed away from THE SHAWHANK REDEMPTION when it made its theatrical run; it was definitely the reason I never caught the film on cable--even after I had heard from countless folks what a fabulous movie it is.  And then recently I stumbled upon it late at night on one of the classic movie channels; the film was well underway, but as soon as I began watching I was hooked.  Subsequently I've seen it several times, rented it, and very much plan to add SHAWSHANK to my DVD collection.  Because--like or no like Robbins--THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is one of the best movies of its--or any--era.Here we have a story of patience and persistence--a story of deep friendship and ultimate triumph.  In SHAWSHANK, a New England maximum security prison, as Morgan Freeman's character, Red, laments, ""All a man has is time.""  So it's what you do with that time that measures a man's worth; for (wrongfully) convicted murderer and former banker Andy Dufresne (Robbins), he elects to eat that proverbial elephant, one bite at a time, because, as we eventually learn, he has the discipline and the fortitude to celebrate a victory of almost unthinkable proportions.  Pitted against a corrupt administration and a brutal prison culture, Andy has the patience and the persistence to score a stunning victory; his journey to the film's superb ending is spellbinding.Freeman and (yes, I have to admit) Robbins are spectacular; all of the cast is terrific, but special kudos to Bob Gunton as the sinister warden and the late great James Whitmore as Brooks, an aging lifer suddenly released back into the ""real world""--a place he no longer recognizes, a place he now very much fears.  It may or may not be a coincidence, but the two greatest films to celebrate the indomitable human spirit are both products of the mid-nineties:Cast Awayand THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  Both are must-haves for serious movie buffs.--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning"	5.0	A Cinematic Triumph	2011-04-21	0	0	0

I just don't like prison movies, and no matter what anyone told me, I couldn't believe that it wouldn't be a depressing story.  Of course when I finally checked it out I discovered that it is indeed very uplifting and inspiring.  Being focused on triumph of the human spirit, of course there is going to be heavy-duty adversity and plenty of sadness along the way, but it is by no means a depressing movie.

Henderson ""dhenderson"""	There have been many good movies since Shawshank but none of them, in my estimation, have been as exciting and interesting as this movie.  That, along with the best acting around by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore and the rest of the cast, just made the movie even better.  Why Tim Robbins and James Whitmore were not nominated for Oscars I cannot understand.  Robbins plays Andy DuFresne, an unemotional type guy in prison for a murder he didn't commit.  His outward lack of emotion was the main reason the jury found him guilty of the crime.  Freeman plays his buddy, Red, and the guy everyone goes to when they want something from the outside.  They form a tight, life-long friendship and everything revolves around them, especially DuFresne.  The ins and outs of this movie and the wonderful, surprising ending make this a feel good movie despite some violence.  It's a don't miss movie in my estimation and I've never heard of anyone that didn't absolutely love it.	5.0	Best Movie I've Seen Since 1994	2007-03-09	2	2	0

Not knowing anything about the film we almost passed up seeing it because the poster and name didn't  look or sound interesting. I'm so glad we took a chance because this is one of the greatest movies ever made! So much more than a prison film, this movie is an inspirational triumph of the human soul.A movie that can be watched over and over again with a great cast and story. It will keep you engrossed from beginning to end. A story about friendship, endurance, compassion and most of all hope! If I had to list 50 films that I could not live without this would easily be on that list. Morgan Freeman co-starring and doing a narrative?!.... you know it's going to be good! This guy could recite the phone book and make it interestingI own the Blu Ray digi book edition and it is a huge improvement in picture and audio. The extras which are very good are all carried over from the 2 disc DVD edition. It's a worthy upgrade for the film transfer quality. How did Forrest Gump beat this out for best picture?!

The Shawshank redemption is one of these movies - deservedly ranking right up there with The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, Casablanca, The Purple Rose of Cairo, Citizen Kane, etc.The story, as everyone knows, is based on a Stephen King novella (the same collection of stories that brought ""Stand By Me"" to the world).  While Steven King is known mostly for his gore and horror stories, these are his two best works ever.Although Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) is the hero and main character in the story, Red (Morgan Freeman) really steals the show.  What an incredible performance!  The rest of the cast is excellent of course.One of the true measures of a movie is how it looks ten years after it's released.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A248OBQ0UUN6VL	E. Dennis Bashaw	Hey, sorry but it is true.  The Shawshank Redemption is nothing more but a modern day update of a 1930's prison picture.  Lets see....1.)  Innocent man sent to jail for crime he did not commit2.)  Crooked guards3.)  Malignant Warden who manipulates prisoners and the system4.)  Saintly fellow convicts who spout metaphysical wisdom like Grandpa on Walton's mountain.5.)  Edgy violence when hero is attacked by fellow inmates (supposed to show the terror of everyman).6.)  Hero appears to be co-opted by the system but then tiumphs  with a semi-spiritual redemption leading to the come-uppence of his tormentors.That pretty much sums up the plot of Shawshank, nothing but a formula picture that you have seen before.  In that way I guess it is comfortable in that it breaks absolutely NO NEW GROUND, it is a re-hash of all the prison pictures that came before it.Shawshank Redemption?  They should all get the chair as it has NO SOCIALLY REDEEMING VALUE to use the prison parlance.  After all the only message I got from it was that white collar crime pays if you are slick.	1.0	Plodding, over=done, stereotypical prison picture	2001-12-10	357	41	316
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2T2XCRR4RYQR6	Ed Maxell	This is a really good movie. I suppose I could just leave that sentence and not write any more, but I feel that I need to jabber on about how it is a good movie.I'll start (where most things start) at the beginning. I  am considered a movie buff at school, yet up until last month, I had not  seen 'The Shawshank Redemption.' Everyone had told me about how good it  was, but time after time I kept passing it up.  It's not that I didn't want  to see it, but I wanted to see others more.  Finally, one day, I saw it on  sale in a video store, and bought it. I plugged it in, watched it, and was  impressed. Not many people have a bad thing to say about this movie, and I  can understand why. Sure, some of it is predictable, but I didn't forsee  the ending. I thought he had given up halfway through the movie, but I,  like Andy's cellmates, doubted his mental integrity. I respect a movie that  makes the viewer seem like they're living it.Since there's nothing I can  say that hasn't already been said about this movie, I'll just say that I,  along with so many others, disagree with Maltin's review, but I do know  that Maltin never really does review a movie, he just summarizes it.	4.0	One of the best	2000-06-02	2	1	1

I do believe it's in part due to the wonderful writing of Stephen King's story, from which this film is adapted, but some of the credit has to go to the actors and directors.Red and Andy are like peas and carrots. Like Peanut butter and jelly. They're yin and yang.An uplifting story with a great central message.

It's been a favorite of mine since I saw it in the theater long ago. I knew it was rated R but I had forgotten the details!  WOW, this movie hasn't faded one bit in 20 years...it's a period movie so it's not dated in the least.  Every detail of this movie is perfect. As another reviewer mentioned, there is nothing in this movie that should have been edited out...it's just one perfect scene and line of dialogue after another, until the tear-jerking ending. The music is lovely and adds much to the atmosphere.  You feel trapped along with Andy, feel his pain and anguish, and root for him and his friends as they bring life to Shawshank Prison. The character of the warden is not only an evil villain, he is believable and you will TOTALLY despise him.  This movie is just amazing and inspiring.  My son is 16 and he agrees!

Its concept is not especially compelling; you might even call it plain, but oh, the execution! Certainly this is how to make a movie.I saw Shawshank in the cinema, which is always good, but not necessary for a film where the plot and filmatic skill are what draw you in. When I left, I noticed that everyone was sniffling. The film is so beautiful that even the tough people cried. I don't mean that it's a tearjerker either, it doesn't make you cry out of sadness or pull cheap stunts to get the tears flowing. Well, perhaps sadness has something to do with it, but it's a deeper kind of sadness, one that's got tears of joy in it too, not ""how could they kill the dog?"" sadness. And while it makes people cry, they're glad they saw it. It's not even my kind of movie, but there's no way I can give it less than a 10.Notice that this movie is loved by all kinds of viewers.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3L2U581LL17EB	Eric	For me, The Shawshank Redemption and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, two movies which have virtually nothing in common, have forever been ingrained as my favorite films of all-time. The reason: both films represent the reasons why I watch movies in the first place. In The Last Crusade's case, it's plain and simple fun escapism, and never has Hollywood movie magic achieved the rousing exhilaration that the third Indy movie has done for me.Then there's the other, more complex reason I see movies, to be enlightened, thought-provoked, challenged, and inspired, all of which The Shawshank Redemption accomplishes and more. Back in 1994, I would have thought someone was pulling my leg if they told me a prison drama starring Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins (the latter of whom I had never even heard of at the time) would endure as one of the most popular films ever. Now, I'm just kicking myself for never having seen the film in theaters.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a banker who's been sentenced to consecutive life terms in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. His first year is in 1947, and from this point on, we're introduced to several other characters and situations over the many years that pass, Dufresne's developing friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), and his becoming a mentor to a hotheaded thief (Gil Bellows), all of which culminate to a masterful conclusion which sharply delivers the film's message.What is that message, you might ask? Why, it's all about hope, about what we do with our lives. To most, living is hell, a harsh reality that involves pain and endurance. But if we take charge of our very own existence, appreciate everything we have and can accomplish, then the very process of living can be wonderful. Even the most cynical people I know still love this movie, a grand statement for just how powerfully effective it is. The plot may not sound interesting to the unitiated (take my word for it, I first saw this film when I was a 14-year old with the attention span of a fly, and the movie still gripped me like no other), but it fits perfectly with the themes at work, and much of the dialogue is so beautifully written, the film simply demands repeat viewings to gather it all.Frank Darabont adapted the script from Stephen King's novella, keeping much of the storylines and dialogue verbatim, while making a few crucial changes, for the better, believe it or not. Darabont's direction is equally as terrific, keeping things low-key and seemingly unexceptional, but truly crafting something memorable and brilliant. Thomas Newman's remarkable score is emotionally touching and uplifting, perfectly fitting with the movie's tone.But great as the direction and writing may be, what puts this over the top for me are the performances. Everyone here is excellent, without the slightest minor exception. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver the best, most powerful performance of their careers in crafting two of the most memorable characters in cinema, with the former proving why he's the greatest actor around and the latter showing why he's one of the more underrated performers. The film is primarily about the friendship between Dufresne and Red, how a man can bring hope to a cynic in even a place as confined as Shawshank Penitentiary. In supporting turns, James Whitmore and William Sadler are exceptional as prisoners who befriend Dufresne. Sadler, in particular, begins the film as a total ass, and it's to his credit that by the end, his transformation to a genuinely likeable character is entirely believable. Even Gil Bellows is excellent here, and anyone who's seen Ally Mcbeal knows he typically defines bland.The Shawshank Redemption's ending is, quite simply, fabulous. Everything about the final half-hour is perfect, from the big surprise twist to the pacing to the music to the acting right down to the very final scene. I'm probably sounding a bit repetitive by now, but everything about the conclusion (much as the rest of the film) is pure genius. There are flaws in The Shawshank Redemption, most particularly why Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown never appear to age over the years that go by, but such a minor mistake isn't even worth muttering to the overwhelmingly positive attributes the film bears. The Shawshank Redemption is the perfect film, and I'm absolutely certain nothing will ever match it, much less surpass it.	5.0	A movie that makes me want to be a better person.	2003-10-16	6	6	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2E4Z4J8BVBGSY	f.a@ix.netcom.com	I watched this movie again because I wanted a great movie to fall asleep to, since I was having difficulty succeeding at the task.  Who the hell was I kidding?  Of course, as it has always happened many, many times with this  movie before, I got so absorbed with the characters, the excellence of the  direction, acting, cinematography, music...taken for a ride of  contemplation and emotion that at times I'll admit nearly brought me to a  tear - that no sleep was induced.  Once again realizing the beauty of this  film, I entertained the idea that it would be incredible to see this movie  on DVD.  I hopped onto Amazon.com to see if it was actually available.  To  my delight, this incredible movie will be released on DVD with some very  nice additions, on Sept. 1st.  Just out of curiosity, I read the 1st couple  of customer reviews.  Then I read the next group of reviews, down to the  bottom of the page.  Then I clicked on the link that read: Click here for  all 74 customer comments...

Yet, I take one (big) exception with this movie and interrupt the series of great qualifiers by asking: How could the hair style and physiognomy of the main two characters stay the same over 20 years of prison time? Had Frank Darabont (the film director) run out of make-up professionals at the time?

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3CWH6VKCTJAD	"""flickjunkie"""	This was one of the best films of the 1990's and was all but snubbed by the Academy.  It was nominated for seven Oscars in 1995 including best  picture, but it came up empty, trodden under by the Gump stampede.Frank  Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's short story was a thing of beauty.  The story of an banker who thinks his way out of a maximum-security prison,  and survives on sheer intelligence, guile and will is expertly spun and  engrossing.  The ending is uplifting and exhilarating.Both Tim Robbins  and Morgan Freeman gave career performances.  Robbins was outstanding in  the portrayal of a character whose phlegmatic and understated persona  belied his cunning and razor sharp intellect.  Freeman was also fantastic  as the old convict who knew how to get things done in the joint.  Freeman's  performance got him a Best Actor nomination in a year when Tom Hanks was a  cinch.Everything about this film was superlative.  The direction, the  cinematography, the sound and the music were all top flight.  It is  difficult to comprehend how such an accomplished film was left with so  little acclaim.I rated this film a 10/10.  I highly recommend it,  although viewers should be advised that there is some disturbing prison  violence.  Don't miss it.	5.0	One of the best films of the 1990's	2000-08-31	8	7	1
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1RBHMMBLODH9R	Fogcatcher	The box office was cruel to this film.  Whether it was the lack of a catchy title, or the rather bland movie poster showing Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the true spirit of this film never got the attention it deserved at it's big-screen opening.  For this, I'm guilty, too.  I showed no interest in it when it opened.  Never have I been so wrong in judging a movie.  The motion picture awards institutions were wrong in not properly recognizing this film as possibly the greatest of all time.  I never expected a prison film to be my all-time favorite.It was two precious years before my brother convinced me to see it.  I must say, no film has ever driven me to tears like this one did.  It is a compelling story of the strength of human character, emerging from the most hopeless of situations.  As it turns out, hope is exactly what empowers the prisoners of Shawshank.(Spoiler ahead!) The cinematography and musical score are magical, especially in the scene where Red is dropped off in Buxton to search the fields for Andy's stash, and where he finally reunites with Andy in Mexico.  It just streams with emotion.  The script: superbly written.  All this was put together by a talented director who can go to his grave knowing he orchestrated one of the finest films in history.  Of course, Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown and other supporting cast members deserve much credit for the emotion they put into their respective characters.If you are one of the unfortunate people who haven't seen this film, you're missing out, big time.  I envy those who are watching it for the first time.  It is so completely engrossing a story, never boring, with a truely satisfying ending.  It exudes hope.

He soon finds himself in Shawshank prison, the year 1947. When he arrives the resourceful ""Red"" (Freeman) believes the aloof man will be a pushover. However, after a major turning point Andy does many extraordinary things in the prison. Whether it is a nice deed for a friend, improving the prison library, carving chess pieces out of rock, or doing taxes for the guards, he keeps himself busy. The strict warden keeps him down but unlike others, Andy does not lose hope. He still has one miraculous trick up his sleeve. Fittingly he instills ""Red"" with hope and in the end they are reunited. I found this film intriguing because in such a corrupt and immoral place, Andy always seems to strive for good.

As an early release to DVD I have always felt the extras that accompany the single disc version don't do the movie any justice.Shawshank is truely one of the greats of all time. While some maybe happy to sit back and ridicule it, I feel that they have clearly missed the point. It's no Angel or Buffy the Vampire Slayer and for that we can be most thankful.It's a movie of true substance that requires an open mind to really appreciate it.The worst thing to ever happen to this movie is that was released in 1994, the same year as Forest Gump.While Gump is a good movie, basically it just a lot of historical events gradually being connected together with Gump as the link.When I left the theatre after seeing Shawshank fo the first time, the one feeling I remember having far more than most was that ""someone had just told me a really great story"".I now understand that Darabont being writer and director was also the brains behind the opera scene.

I thought the storyline of ""The Shining"" was really stupid but I managed to still enjoy watching it because of the brilliance of Stanley Kubrick who somehow managed to make my eyes addicted to watching the film not for the storyline but for the wonderful images we get to watch courtesy of the Kubrick genius.  I detected some Kubrick influences here like the scene of the soaring overhead view of the prison near the beginning which has its parallel in the beginning of ""The Shining"" but overall as a film with a great script, great casting and great directing of a Stephen King story this has to be the best one ever.  Is there any film that is better at extolling the virtues of hope over incredible odds or how good finally triumphs over evil?  This Blu Ray release has excellent picture quality although there were a few frames with the odd white spot here and there but overall thankfully this doesn't overly distract from the enjoyment of the film.  The sound quality is also very well done making this together with the very well put-together digibook format among the best blu-ray releases that I've ever seen.Great script, great acting, great storytelling makes this film a must-see and this blu ray release the definitive version to have in your video library.Highly recommended!"	5.0	Certainly Among the Best Ever Films of All Time Comes To Blu Ray With Excellent Results!	2011-09-03	0	0	0

But even when it pops up on cable, I cannot not watch it.  This film has that truly exceptional touch of magic, that very few motion pictures have.  An absolute gem of a film, that has taken its rightful place alongside classics, in my mind, such as Casablanca.The performances--all of them--are magnificent.  The cinematography is rich, life affirming, encompassing, and colorful.  The screenplay is in parts positively sublime;  Red's (Morgan Freeman) dialogue in the last five minutes of this film reduces me to tears and fills me with such a well of emotion that I have to go outside for a walk and hug the first stranger I meet.  An absolute clinic in non-simplistic and direct screenwriting that keeps it simple and truthful.  And the direction of this film is fantastic.This is not just a truly great film, it is also a necessary one.

Boy, I really scored on this one! It was a fine, fine movie and for under four dollars! I'm amazed that this didn't get a Best Picture Academy Award, it's that good. Okay, it was nominated for seven awards. Does  that tell you something?Well, what can I say? Five stars! Alas, this one already has over a thousand Amazon reviews and a lot of them are very well done! I'd just like to add a few of my impressions and suggest you read some of the very fine top reviews. The direction, the photography and sound and the flow of the story were all first rate. No question. The acting was excellent across the board and throughout the movie. I felt that I was in a very real and very menacing situation and these were real people. It wasn't an action movie or anything like that, but what action there was gripped your attention. No boredom here!The story involved Andy (Tim Robbins), who was wrongly convicted of the double murder of his wife and her lover and was given a double-life prison sentence. He ended up in the Shawshhank State Prison of Maine. There he met long-teerm resident ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman) and they very gradually developed a deep friendship over the next several decades. The movie documents their friendship and the brutality, meaninglessness and boredom of prison life. Some of the prisoners come off rather badly, as might be expected. The guards and prison administration fare much worse. The whole place is just a very slowly unfolding nightmare. Finally, after enduring decades of this depraved life, Andy manages a very clever escape. ""Red"" rejoins him on the outside deep in Mexico after he is paroled. It's the only bright spot in the movie and may put a few tears in your eyes.The plot was extremely well done and carried out with only one exception. The last ten minutes, after Andy had escaped prison, was glossed over to an extreme degree. It made no difference to the story, and I wouldn't suggest changing it. That little ending part of the movie just doesn't fit well with the preceding flow. In any case, Five Stars!Gary Peterson"	5.0	Five Stars!	2012-03-09	2	2	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A336AQNZNV4U6S	"""gatormad"""	The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen. It is the story of friendship,time,and most importantly, hope.Andy Dufresne, played superbly by Tim Robbins, is a man sent to prison for the alleged muder of his wife and her lover. While in prison, he meets Red, who is played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman. The unlikely friendship that forms between these two men who come from such diverse backgrouds is a part of what makes this movie so incredible. They become each others best friend and confidant; something that everyone in prison could use.Another element that plays such a key role in this movie is that of time. Not only does this movie span over twenty years, but time itself plays a key role in the plot of the movie. Although the time Andy spends in prison takes away a large portion of his life,in the end you might want to call it his best friend.The music of this movie is what ties all the emotional elements together. Thomas Newman does an amazing job with the soundtrack. His music transports you to the movie's place and time. It has the power to make you feel what the characters are experienceing. It also progresses chronologically to stay with the changing years.But the one elment that makes this movie so truly remarkable is the theme of hope. It gives us something to be excited about and reminds us to continue to hope in our everyday lives. Never does Andy Dufresne lose hope that he will survive his struggle. Red, on the other hand, thinks hope is a dangerous thing. But Andy pursists and wins Red over by the end of the film. I think Andy says it best when he states, &quot;Hope is a good thing. Maybe even the best of things. And no good thing ever dies.&quot;	5.0	HOPE	2001-09-21	4	4	0

Same as the year of the boat.  Me and a fellow critic who I admire were just talking about Morgan Freeman's performance. It was outstanding, only seen by him in one other film(Seven).  A film like this deserves a better version on DVD though.  This is the feel good movie of all time.  It is a story of the human soul and spirit and overcoming things that keep your inspiration down.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ANBQIWHO9JRFS	General Zombie	Many people, myself included, much of the time, have unending disdain for popular taste.  Sometimes, however, something truly deserving works its way into the public consciousness.  The now massive popularity of 'The Shawshank Redemption' proves that the supposed biases of the typical film viewer aren't as set in stone as idiot executives and critics would have you believe.  This film is all about character and relationships, and it's rather long and has no action or sex appeal (no female characters at all, really) in it.  However, the strong human connection that is possible in film comes through here better than in just about any other film I've ever seen, and it seems like plenty of other people feel the same way.The film centers on two characters, Red and Andy Dufresne, both lifers, convicted murderers, in Shawshank prison.  These guys are played by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, respectively, and the two great actors give the best performances that I've seen from either of them.  No one else has too huge of a role, but everyone is certainly believable enough, and the minor characters have enough quirks and strange things about them to make them interesting with out turning them into caricatures. (Well Bob Gunton's Norton is perhaps a bit too villainous to be utterly believable, but it's just a little bit too much.)The direction is firm and not at all flashy, save for a few nice establishing shots designed to acquaint us with the prison.  I typically like my movies to be flashy, but that isn't necessary here, and would probably prove to be distracting.  The score is fairly conventional, but it's also very beautiful and haunting, and a perfect backdrop to the more significant scenes.Both critics and fans of the film accuse it of being 'slow', but I don't really agree.  This movie doesn't even really have a plot to it, and thus can't really be fast or slow.  It doesn't seem to be building to anything, though this impression is, of course, proven wrong.  This film is just about the characters' lives, and it's largely just a series of individual episodes narrated and commented on by Red's character where we learn about the mysterious, untouchable Andy and how his stoic character effects those around him.  Thus, pretty much every scene is important, in its way.It also deserves particular credit for the remarkably good adaptation.  The Stephen King novella that this is based on is good, but hardly transcendent.  It also covers a longer period of time and contains fairly few specific details and virtually no minor characters.  They manage to both condense and bolster the material, combining characters and creating new ones and just solidifying a tale that was remarkably formless and free flowing, all while remaining quite faithful to the source material.  Furthermore, the screenwriter had a particularly good eye for the most memorable lines of the novella and finds a way to include all of them in the film.Again, this is a film that relies on human interest and is fundamentally a feel-good kinda film, in spite of the fact that almost everything that happens in this film is bad.  Of course, this is probably why it works with so many people.  A film that talks about how wonderful life is unlikely to make anyone feel good about themselves if they think about it too much.  Thematically it is simple, just saying that happiness come form within, and how we have to find joy in little things and always cling to hope and so on.  Again, simple stuff, but absolutely true and I've never heard anything truly profound in a movie anyway.  The best you can hope for with thematic effect in a films comes from making you remember and believe what you already knew, again.  (Interestingly enough, the film in recent memory which  is most effective on this level is `28 Days Later'.  Lotsa people didn't seem to notice that, as that isn't what you're looking for in a horror movie, but it's there if you want it, and makes that into a truly great film. I know I'm getting off topic, but I really like to promote that film.)Needless to say, there are gonna be plenty of people out there who are sufficiently cynical and that it won't be able to affect them, and the generally episode driven drama will probably be insufficient to hold your interest if you can't feel for the characters.  If you're this kinda person you need not bother with this film.  But, on the other hand, I'm a fairly bitter and cynical person myself, yet I love this movie and am moved by the more effective scenes every time even after about 10 or so viewings over a decade.  So you never know.Grade: A	5.0	Modern Classic	2006-02-08	9	8	1
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ATE02BJK9BJF9	George R Johnston	This is one of King's best tales. Shawshank Redemption in its book incarnation is very hard to put down. The movie is true to the book and has the assembly of some very fine actors, including Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. It is a charming tale, with great photography and excellent performances by every member of the cast. Character develpment is a hallmark of King's writing. It would be difficult to develop the characters in the movie the way King does in the book, but there is no doubt these people are as real as they are in print. The result is a screenplay that gives a depressing image of prison life and the struggles endured in this stark environment. This reviewer has seen this movie many times and it is just as engaging now as it was upon the first viewing.	5.0	Quintessential King	2013-07-05	0	0	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AJZSU8BG2LKZI	"""gggindel"""	This movie is a real masterpiece: the poetic dialogues, the protagonists' intense performance, the human values of dignity and solidarity. Andy is symbol of the concept the ancient Romans called &quot;gutta cavat  lapidem&quot; (&quot;drop digs stone&quot;). In other words, Andy waits for  the right moment to be free: he knows his innocence and is aware that it is  necessary to be careful and wisely strategic. He is like Ulysses, who  disguises himself as a sheep, in order to escape from Polyphemus' cave,  without hesitating to renounce strategically his leader demeanour, making  himself mistaken instead of a sheep. In modern culture the metaphor of  sheep resists as an idiom defining a condition of passive subjection.  Andy's condition of frustration and slavery in prison is the same.  Polyphemus (as well as the director of prison, in this movie), feels the  backs of all his sheeps, without being sharp enough to find out that  Ulysses and his friends are underneath their bellies. Ulysses' &quot;eyes  of mind&quot; are always open and allow him to save his own life.  Similarly, Andy's &quot;eyes of hope&quot; are always open, as well,  nevertheless the other prisoners provoke him fiercely and try to discourage  him. Equally, once he returned to Ithaca, Ulysses pretends to be an old  beggar, in order to enter his home without being immediately eliminated by  the suitors who tried to replace him during his absence (just as in this  movie it could happen to a prisoner who tried to escape during a moment of  desperation). He pretends to be weak and poor while actually he did not  lose his strength: he is waiting for the right moment to reveal himself and  assert his power again. The same happens to Andy, who demonstrates the  courage of the wait and the strategic attitude of a champion of chess  (another fascinating metaphor recurring in the movie). Using the last verse  of The Police's song &quot;Wrapped around your finger&quot;, &quot;Devil  and the deep blue sea behind me vanish in the air you'll never find me, I  will turn your face to alabaster, then you'll find your servant is your  master. And you'll be wrapped around my finger&quot;. It is the upright  man's redemption. Hope, intelligence, self-control and patience at last  win. A great lesson of life for all of us.	5.0	A modern Ulysses	2000-07-19	2	2	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3EBMERWAK5C05	gh2user	This is my second favorite King/Darabont collaborations.  My first being The Green Mile.  A great story, with a great cast, and great direction.  I honestly believe this to be one of Morgan Freeman's, and Tim Robbins best roles to date.  The characters in this film are some of the best written I've ever seen in a film.  A few of Darabont's go to actors are sprinkled throughout.It's a very touching story and couldn't have a better cast or director.  I hope King and Darabont continue to make films, as I think Darabont is the only director to actually understand the stories and how they need to be made.	5.0	Great	2014-01-23	0	0	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AUUPEKNAHQRIE	Gideon Griebenow	I haven't actually experienced the DVDs, so I can't comment on it specifically, but hear me out. Also, these two are *always* thought of together, so here goes:  I've watched both The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile more than once before reading the books.  If I *have to* pick one movie as my all-time favourite, it would be The Shawshank Redemption.  The book is really brilliant, but I'm of the opinion that the movie did the unthinkable and actually improved on it.  In my mind, the situation is reversed when it comes to The Green Mile.  Although the movie is really brilliant, the book is better.  Maybe the reason is that The Green Mile doesn't get the words and ideas as Stephen King uses them into the movie as exceptionally successful as The Shawshank Redemption.  Still, both of them are worth every dollar and every minute (and I'm able to say this even after seeing Shawshank about 8 times and Green Mile more than 3)!	5.0	Book or Movie?	2004-05-18	0	0	0

Prisoners have an uncanny ability to realize a potential, they probably misused on the outside of prison walls, to become more creative.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AYRW5C01ANXNC	"""goldcoastreviews"""	When this film first came out back in the early '90s, I resisted all praise and acclamations. I was not a big fan of Stephen King back then nor prison movies. How wrong I was.&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is  now one my all time favorite movies. This powerful yet exquisitely  addicting flick shimmers with a lyrical quality unmatched in any book of  prose. Morgan Freeman, as &quot;Red&quot;, narrates the complex story of  one intelligent man, Andy, who is wrongly imprisoned for murder. Andy, an  ex-banker, played perfectly by Tim Robbins, quietly lives his life behind  bars and in the sand-yard. But is he resigned to this life? No. He subtly  works his magical patience and resolve over a span of many years and  delivers to other memorable characters and to us, the one thing we all need  to know exists....hope.One of my first favorite scenes is when Andy  outwits a guard on a blazing hot rooftop for a few icy cold beers for  himself and other prisoners. As I am writing this review, I am smiling.  There is so much to this tale....Beautifully shot, well adapted, and  perfectly casted, &quot;Shawshank&quot; will forever be a shimmering wave  of emotion....rolling, thundering, smashing and slowly ebbing to the  shore.Thanks for your interest &amp; comments--CDS	5.0	Shawshank Shimmers	2000-07-20	3	2	1

In fact, I doubt many people read the book at all; in case you were wondering, it's by Stephen King.Now hold on, don't leave yet. Stephen King has  written some pretty bad stuff before, but this isn't bad at all. It's an  incredible story, and the movie is even better. It's the best prison drama  ever made. It's a must see for anyone who loves great movies.In this  wonderful screen adaption, Andrew Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, is a  young banker who is convicted of killing his wife. At first everything  points to him as the suspect, and a Maine jury has no problem convicting  him of the crime. Andrew, or Andy, as he becomes known, is sent of to  Shawshank, a Maine prison, to live out his life sentence. At first Andy  doesn't fit in, but soon the convicts around him begin to respect him for  his persistence in trying to become free. He makes friends with a man  called Red (played by Morgan Freeman), a man who can get things. This  friendship grows, and soon becomes very strong. You begin to realize, as  the plot plays out, that Andy may not be guilty.In the end, this is a  movie about hope, about never giving up. Andy strives to succeed, even in  the looming shadow of the cruel warden. The acting in this film is great,  enough so to match the plot. It is a true classic, one that everyone needs  to see.	5.0	Excellent Movie!	2000-06-16	3	2	1

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1LLYVPXUBWCC8	Helen L. Kerslake	"When Andy Dufresne, a young and successful banker, discovers his wife in bed with another man his life takes a dramatic turn for the worse. When the lovers' bodies are discovered, shot repeatedly with bullets from a gun linked to Andy, he becomes wrongly imprisoned. Sent to a maximum security prison run by a corrupt and over-zealous religious warden he struggles to hang on to hope of returning to the outside world and reclaiming a sense of normality. After a period of isolation he finally approaches one of the other inmates, a convict called Red who is the only person in Shawshank Prison guilty of their crime. What begins as a business partnership between two characters, who would be unlikely to cross paths in the real world, quickly turns into a lifelong friendship. Together they manage to fight impossible odds to survive and prove that both hope and the possibility for redemption never die.I have heard many people rave about `The Shawshank Redemption' over the years but have only just gotten around to watching it myself, and the praise heaped upon this film scarcely do it justice. This is not just the story of a man wrongly imprisoned, or the astonishing reality of life behind bars, but an emotional drama which reels you in from the onset. The movie is quite lengthy however I found myself unable to press the stop button as the level of interest was maintained steadily throughout, and I kept wanting to ""watch a bit more"". It has been a long time since I have actually cried while watching a film or sat on the edge of my seat literally in suspense, but `The Shawshank Redemption' managed to make me do both.The characters are what make this movie brilliant and the casting of Morgan Freeman as Red and Tim Robbins as Andy was spot on. They managed to convince me that I was watching real life and actual circumstances rather than just a realistic portrayal of the prison world. Their reactions and behaviour were original but suited the film, and really highlighted how easy it can be to become a victim but that you do not have to accept that role forever.I felt inspired by the ideas raised and loved how my mind was encouraged to consider certain beliefs and rules in society. This movie challenges some of the toughest issues facing us in the modern age, even though the film was set over a period from the 1940's - 1980's. Frank Darabont has produced an excellent movie which does not disappoint in any way.

He read this book in passing and after the second reading bought the rights from King and after nine long incubation period came &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; the movie. I would be doing a disservice if divulge the story suffice to say this is a story of a convict who has more convictions in his soul than the allegged convictions and you want to hear this story from the greatest narrator of all times, Morgan Freeman,you have to see for yourself the livid performances and take my word this is like the greatest Buffet, you will keep going for more and you will never have satiety since this is the greatest drama ever told and told brilliantly by Frank Darabont. Great movies have one thing in common,a Screen writer who also wields the megaphone-like Coppola in Godfather and Scorcese in Good Fellas-God bless these kindred since they have made some great movies and Shawshank Redemption is one of them.	5.0	An Epitome for Hope.	2004-03-10	1	1	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	"Based on a Stephen King's shot novel, this ambitious film has several levels to analyze. But there is a Montesquieu ' s  clever statement that I would remind for you; ""I `ve been noticed that if you want to triumph in this world you have to look like a fool , but without being it"".Watching carefully this picture, we have to underline the remarkable and wise election of these two giant actors: Tim Robbins as Andy Defresne, a successful executive who lives in own flesh the shame of the adultery and besides has been sent to prison being innocent. Once he installs in prison he decides to bring hope airs to that hostile and inhuman environment. He will befriend with Morgan Freeman, and the time elapses from 1949 through 1966: three generations; three portrait Goddess: Rita Hayworth (Gilda), Marilyn Monroe (Seven Years itch) and Raquel Welch ( One million years before Christ) that will cover his passion for the beautiful women but also his dreams. His perseverance, patience and goodwill will transform the inhumanity and soon he will sculpt not only chess figures on rock, but the respect and tender of every man in the prison. Thanks to his experience in the Finances World, he will create a solid reputation and special status among the prison's highest authorities.And in that state of things, you will understand there are two suggested, deserved and  beautiful homage to Robert Bresson's A man escapes, and Alejandro Dumas? The Count of Monte Christ but complemented with a more terrene vision, even the circumstances not necessarily be the same.Stunning film and one of the most important American pictures in the nineties."	5.0	Do not defy a smart man!	2005-06-25	1	0	1

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A7P9LPMSBAAME	Holly	This film is universally recognized as AMONG THE VERY BEST MOVIES EVER MADE. THAT'S A TALL ORDER. TIM ROBBINS and MORGAN FREEMAN have created characters that will live on in your heart and memory. This story flows from the depths of overwhelming DESPAIR to the heights of GLORY. Reminiscent of Les Miserable, a young man is accused of a crime he did not commit and is incarcerated for decades to endure the worst of what life has to offer. AND IT AIN'T PRETTY!! THE REST OF THE CAST IS STELLAR!! I guess this is the ULTIMATE OF BUDDY MOVIES. The prison friendship that develops and evolves over decades between TIM ROBBINS AND MORGAN FREEMAN is a beautiful thing to see. It's a horror story that's NOT ALL BAD. QUITE THE CONTRARY. How could something so REPUGNANT eventuate into something so JOYOUS?If you have never seen this movie, VIEW IT. (It's about 20 years old) DO YOURSELF A FAVOR.	5.0	ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER MADE.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AGUOLTNDRVWEV	"""ianb-c"""	This movie is an exellent example of a terrible life turning around from hope. The acting couldnt have been better, the novella shared the same theme, the warming and sad music is uplifting, the length is good, not dragged like some would say, directing is remarkable, there is so much to say. It did not follow the book closely, actually it was far away from close. But there is more of a story in the movie thanks to Frank Darabont. The novella was great, but more of an information layout than a story. This movie was in 1994, and nominated for best picture.  This is way better than the extremely overrated Forrest Gump that won for best picture that year. On a last note, Tom Hanks is cool, but it is unneceptable how he won for best actor over Mogan Freeman's triumphant acting in this film. All Hanks had to do in Forrest Gump was act like an idiot for two hours, he raised now levels throughout the movie while Morgan started as a guilty man and worked his way up to redemption during the time of the movie. Anyway, this one is a keeper.	5.0	Tragedy to Paradise: The Shawshank Redemtion	2001-07-08	0	0	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1Y0HX12MCT6OR	I'm Right	The Shawshank Redemption is a story based off a Stephen King novel (he suprisingly toned down the supernatural elements) about a man who may or may not have killed his wife and is sent to 'two life sentences' for each person. The story however is told through Morgan Freeman with his usual excellent narration, and the majority of the story takes place in the grey frigid prison, and the length of the movie helped emphasize the feeling most of the characters had of spending most of their life behind bars.The acting is uniformly great, my favorite probably being the greaser that comes mid-way into the movie because he had such a type-cast role of a misfit but he exceeded expectations. As the story progresses Tim Robbin's motivations are consistently vague but his intentions of making the other inmates lives better are clear. One thing I really liked about this movie is the antagonist of the movie is always replaced by an even worse one, first it starts out with the rapist, then he's replaced by the main guard, then the main gaurd is just the henchman of the Warden, the biggest P.O.S. of them all, really well done.I don't know what else to really say without ruining it, just watch the damn thing.	5.0	IMDB's #1 Movie doesn't Disappoint	2012-06-04	3	2	1
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AUTTUNKHFBAZY	"indyblackfilm ""IBF"""	"Well most of what you've read in the other reviews is accurate, except that is is a film about redemption, plain and simple - hence the title, Shawshank (the prison) Redemption.  The characters imprisioned in Shawshank are guilty of one crime or another, whether Red's armed robbery, Brook's spending his entire life in prison (only to commit suicide upon his release) or Andy's neglect of his wife for his career.  BTW, the last part of Jeff Shannon's review is INCORRECT, but I won't ruin the story for you.To say that Morgan Freeman's acting in this film was bad is laughable.  Get a life - only three people saw ""Dreamcatcher.""  Morgan's sensitive portrayal of a repentant armed robber is exemplary, and his onscreen paring with Tim Robbins is a masterstroke of casting and chemistry."	5.0	OMG, who are these people?	2004-09-19	7	5	2

Lowry	The Shawshank Redemption was a very powerful drama movie with amazing acting job by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman what was most shocking was the fact it was wirtten by Steven King never knew he had a talent for more then just horror and suspense triller books.  To me this is one of best movies ever made in movie history,  some people feel this 2 disc special edition deserves more special features but I think it had enough special features.  But no matter what people say this is a truly great movie and deserves to be in anyone's drama movie collection for all time.  Also for some it shows how life inside prison really works day to day year after year all its dirty little secrets.  But the main character played by Tim Robbins was right about one thing in the movie Hope they can't take away from you to paraphrase the line from the movie.  Because as for myself Hope is all that is keeping me going besides my Faith in God watching over me everyday of my life on this Earth.  So in closing if you have yet to watch this movie and enjoy or want to see a great drama movie and one of finest movies ever made then buy this movie and add it to your movie collection.	5.0	One of best drama movies ever made and was shock it was written by Steven King	2013-02-07	0	0	0

This movie deals with something every person has dealt with in their life: Hope and being taken advantage of.  Not everyone has been oppresed by the British.Why Morgan freeman didnt win Best Actor is mindblowing after his performance as &quot;Red&quot;.  His scenes alone towards the end of the film are wonderful and are my favorite part of the whole film.

"""The send you here for life, and that's exactly what they take.""This is one of the most inspirational movies I've ever watched. There are few things more satisfying than seeing a man, horribly wronged by ""the system"", come out on top through sheer will and hope.Another great part of this film is the portrayal of the other inmates. They had actually committed their crimes, but you couldn't help coming to realize that they were still human beings despite their screw-ups. I felt sorry for the abuses they endured at the hands of the guards. Once you cared about the characters, you couldn't help but be enraged by the corruption of the prison system.But it all comes back to the overall theme, which is not giving up.  Not losing hope. You watch as over the long passage of time as the characters grow and change, and how their lives are changed and shaped by Andy Dufresne, and his basic life philosophy.""Get busy living, or get busy dying."""	5.0	Fantastic film!

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A395OEMWZXZKEH	Jake Stanley	The Shawshank Redemption is just awesome. The story is of a convicted murderer, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbings) that is accused his wife and the man she was cheating with. Dufresne is thrown into a correctional facility called Shawshank prison. He is befriended by Red (Morgan Freeman) who also is serving a life-term for murder. A rough first two years of getting harshly beaten by fellow inmates, Andy gets used to prison life. His friend Red is known to be able to get things for the inmates from the outside world, cigarretes, whiskey, playing cards, or whatever. When Andy asks Red to get him a small rock hammer, Red thinks he is crazy. But on the outside world, along with being a banker, Dufresne was very interested in geology and rocks, and is convinced he can escape with his knowledge.Many years pass, and Andy gains lots of respect from all of the prison. His financial knowledge helps alot of the guards to figure out trust funds and other things that they can do with their money. He ends up basically managing the whole prison's budget. He sends away hundreds of letters asking for fundings for a better library from the government. After eight years or so, he gets around 700 dollars and buys books and builds a nice library. A prisoner that Andy befriends comes to Shawshank, and Andy helps him get his high school diploma. One day, Red is telling Billy (the prisoner that Dufresne helps) about why Andy is in Shawshank. Billy is shocked, and claims that one of his cellmates at another prison said that he had commited that exact crime. Andy hears this, and goes to the Warden (the head of the prison) and tells him this. The Warden doesn't believe him. Andy calls him some bad names, and pays for it with 2 months in solitary confinement. When Andy gets out, he decides he's had enough. He decides it is time to escape from Shawshank.The rest I cannot tell you, you need to see for yourself. The Shawshank Redemption is an excellent movie. It really portrays another world. I definetly reccomend it to anyone.	5.0	Shawshank in Top 5 greatest movies of all time!	2002-08-12	0	0	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1GBMGSDDG7BFL	James Crouch	Every so often, a certain type of movie comes along that deeply moves anyone who watches it. This movie is grand in scope and scale, its character portrayals so moving and so real, that you cannot help becoming completely engrossed by it. I believe that the Shawshank Redemption is one of these movies. Often times, movies based on books are sub par, with the common complaint being, &quot;The book is better.&quot; Well I, for one, have read the book and watched the movie, and I assure you that the movie is not a let down at all, but rather a triumph of modern cinema. The DVD disc itself is a little thin on features, but at an average price of about $15, anyone with a DVD player and a taste for Drama(or anyone who simply likes excellent movies) should own this movie on DVD.  Now, on to the movie itself. The Shawshank Redemption saw career-defining performances from many of its cast members,including Tim Robbins, who became a top star after his incredible performance, and Morgan Freeman, who added to his already impressive list of accolades with his perfect supporting role. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a Maine banker who is unjustly convicted of killing his wife and her lover after he discovers that she is having an affair. Andy is a true outsider in the bleak world of Shawshank prison, an educated man not used to violence and despair that are an everyday part of prison life. Robbins plays this part to perfection, showing emotional vulnerability, as well as the stregnth to overcome the greatest adversity. Freeman plays Red, &quot;The man who can get it all,&quot; a prisoner serving a life sentence for murder, who befriends Andy. Red adapts to his life in prison by becoming a source for bringing outside goods to prisoners.  The interplay between Robbins and Freeman is one of the highlights of the movie, as these two wonderful actors test each other's limits. James Whitmore plays Brooks Hatlin, a man who spends his entire life in Shawshank as a librarian. Once released,as an old man, Brooks finds that he would rather die that live another day in a unfamiliar world. His character is a tragic example of how the human mind can become so attached to its circumstances(even the blak setting of a prison) that it simply cannot let go of them. Bob Gunton takes a memorable turn as Bible-quoting Warden Samuel Norton, whose facade of morality is merely a mask for his depraved behavior and illegal activites.  Frank Darabont, who wrote the screenplay and directed this movie,is a master of skilfully portraying human emotions. He deserves all the credit he gets for helping to shape this memorable movie experience. Stepen King's brilliance shines through, as his ability to create complex and memorable characters is evident in this movie.  The bottom line is this: The Shawshank Redemption is a monumental achievement in motion picture history. It is defined by a memorable story, engrossing character performances, and one of the most truly gratifying endings I have ever seen in a movie. This is truly one of the greatest movies ever made.	5.0	A Triumph, One of the Best Movies Ever Made	2000-10-26	109	103	6

The one  &quot;theme&quot; that I took away from the film is how the actions, high  personal standards set by one individual can influence, lift up and inspire  an entire community, even if this community consists of prisoners. All of  the characters are complex, richly developed, intelligently casted and  wonderfully portrayed.  A round of applause for James Whitmore who  masterfully played the old librarian, replaced by Andy when he is released  from prison.  I consider this to be a &quot;must see&quot; film.

I just wish that he kept his politics to himself and not used his celebrity to amplify them. Nothing wrong with free speech- but actors generally have more media attention than the millions of fans they have. When was the last time CNN asked you about whether you liked a candidate, or policy?Anyway, Tim Robbins is a great actor, but I can't get the image of him telling me how to think out of my head when I see him act now- and that has ruined a lot of movies for me.	1.0	Was a great movie - until Robbins opened his mouth	2005-03-06	170	5	165

This DVD preserves all the spendor and vast cinematography of the big screen and proves to be an absolute winner for repeat viewings.

The sweeping, stirring soundtrack capture the mood of this story perfectly.A story with an INTELLECTUAL protagonist is soooo refreshing! A hero that THINKS his way through crisis and danger, rather than the typical kick butt in most movies.The way this movie misleads and surprises the viewer is tremendous.

Stephen King may be known for horror but I think his greatest stories are those such as the one this movie was based on and 'The Body' which was turned into the movie Stand By Me - They can be found in his novel 'Different Seasons' which is a must buy for any collection.  Someone pointed out this movie never got an Oscar which is astounding but not surprising.  I can't remember ever enjoying a movie that won big at the Oscars and find most of their winners to be awful and forgettable (ie: Les Miserables).  The test of time and consumer spending are far more telling than any award for revealing what films are truly great - This film has proven to be one of them.	5.0	Belongs in the top 5 of best movies ever made	2014-02-26	0	0	0

Even that short amount of time, though, I was blown away by this fantastic film. The next day, I went out  and rented this film and loved in even more. This is arguably the greatest  prison film of all time and is worth the time you spend watching it. I have  to to say shame on Leonard Maltin for claiming that this film is too long.  I could have watched another two hours of this great film. I love this  movie and (sorry Forest Gump) it should have won Best Picture.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1V1BMGBWTNLNX	"""jenn2"""	This is brilliant. I have seen it twice and I recommend it to all my friends.Tim Robbins plays a banker (Andy) that was sentenced to prison for killing his wife and lover, whose quiet demeanor was a cover for his iron-will, determination and inner strength. Morgan Freeman, plays friend and cell mate, Red, represents the rest of us, who are on a journey to discover what made Andy tick. Both actors put up an excellent performance that keeps one enthralled in the film, wanting to know everything they do, think, and how they develop over the course of their years in prison.The irony in this film struck me most. From the little ironies such as whether Andy really murdered his wife, to the secret behind his &quot;obsession&quot; with movie star posters. It was subtly presented with maximum impact.I have read Stephen King's book and I think that this film is a very good film portrayal of his writing with charaters that adhere closely to the book, and are very well-explored by the two experienced actors. Definitely worth watching.	5.0	I'm impressed	2000-07-20	2	1	1

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AXZNYIM2FG63S	J. GENIO	The Shawshank Redemption and Schindler's List have a common theme:  Using the system to achieve one's goal.  In the case of Oscar Schindler, he used  the corrupt NAZI government system to save lives.  In the Shawshank  Redemption, banker Tim Robbins (Andy) is convicted of a double-murder --  killings that he did not commit.Tim Robbins (Andy) realizes that  bucking the system will only get him hurt.  So, Tim Robbins decides to use  his time constructively.  That is, instead of rocking the boat and causing  problems, he uses the corrupt and brutal prison system to his benefit.Eventually, by being the model, helpful prisoner; he earns the trust of  the crooked prison warden and the cruel, brutal jailers. This opens the  door for Robbins's escapeSure, we can focus on Andy's escape from  prison.  However, this is not the point of the film.  The lesson in this  movie is on using time constructively to work within a given system, not  against it. Working against a system gets you branded as a trouble maker, a  ne'er-do-well, a radical; and, eventually, it could get you thrown in jail,  or worse.  You can accomplish more by working within a system -- no matter  how corrupt, cruel, or brutal -- to achieve a desired goal; to make a  difference -- as in the case of Oscar Schinder and Andy.This movie is  definitely worth watching more than one time.  The film does not drag on;  it moves along at a decent pace.  While watching this film, you will see  how Tim Robbins uses the system to his benefit.  Tim Robbins and Morgan  Freeman put on a stellar performance.Good movie. . . .Good Acting. . .  Good Lesson. . . Good fun.	5.0	A Lesson for All - Use the System	2000-07-23	0	0	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A346QTZZ9WNEAA	J. Huang	"I am writing this only because Shawshank Redemption is the #1 rated film on IMDB.This movie is about a deep emotional relationship between two men. The entire plot is set into motion by the main character's (Andy Dufresne) scarring disappointment with a woman, his unfaithful wife. Although he does not actually kill her, a botched confrontation and a farfetched coincidence result in his being imprisoned for her murder. This is better than if he had gone through with the murder himself: it is his hatred of a woman that makes him a transgressive. It is the intent, his sin of thought, not an actual deed, which strengthens prison as a metaphor for his burgeoning homosexuality.In prison, homosexuality is normalized. This is achieved not only through the characters of ""the sisters,"" who violently rape Dufresne repeatedly, but also in other ways, such as the inmates' referral to new arrivals as ""fresh fish."" And of course, prison is a space where social intercourse occurs only between men. It is in this context that Dufresne develops his bond with the other lead, Ellis Redding. Through Dufresne's relationship with Red a distinction is made between what could be called the involuntary or forced homosexuality of ""the sisters"" and voluntary or romantic homosexuality, such as the unique friendship between Dufresne and Red. After a particularly harsh beating by ""the sisters"" that lands Dufresne in the hospital for a couple of weeks, Red organizes a return welcome with the gift of several rocks, which Dufresne desires and uses to make figurines.The movie's climax, the prison break, also contains some very overt symbolism. The posters of popular actresses that Dufresne obtains from Red and hangs in his cell figure prominently in the film and in the original novella by Stephen King (the novella is titled Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption). Many viewers may have taken this as sufficient ""signal"" that the film is not homosexual. However, Dufresne uses one of these posters to cover up the hole he has picked out of the prison wall and uses to escape through the prison's sewer. Here, the escape through the sewer is an obvious symbol for anal sex. A sewer is a long tube that contains human waste, like an anus. It is also possible to describe the moment Andy emerges from the prison's sewer as ""climactic,"" characterized by a general feeling of ""release,"" and metaphorically the escape through the sewer allows Andy to ""escape"" the problems caused by his relationship with his ex-wife. The poster's role in the film is to conceal this opening to the ""sewer,"" to the homosexual escape. In the scene leading up to its discovery the warden accuses Red of being ""as thick as thieves"" with Dufresne (another metaphor of transgression), then in frustration throws a rock at the poster, after very pointedly accusing it of being a party to the ""conspiracy."" Dramatically, the rock flies through the poster, exposing Dufresne's heterosexual utterance as paper-thin, with nothing to back it. Careful viewers will also note that Dufresne's taste in wall-covering includes many types of posters--Albert Einstein, various maps, portraits, landscapes, etc.--and that the poster concealing the escape route--the specific poster designated to mislead in the film's plot--is, suspiciously, unique in its depiction of a sexualized woman. To escape the confinement caused by his rejection of women, Dufresne turns to the anus, but cannot do so openly; his homosexuality must be concealed with signs of heterosexuality, in this case Raquel Welch.Tommy's subplot is distinct because it triggers the turn in Andy's character, and it intertwines with Andy's rivalry with Norton. Tommy is the liminal figure in the film; being a new arrival, a caricature of the virulent male, and possessing information from beyond prison that can free Andy, he straddles the divide between the ""straight"" world outside and the ""gay"" world of the prison. This is why his murder is a turning point for Andy. Yes, it destroys his chances of being released, but if you view Norton as representing the perceived heterosexual establishment, which must rule by rational means, Tommy's murder dispels Andy's faith in that rationality and the entire legitimacy of the heterosexual power structure represented by Norton and his guards. Keep in mind that up to this point in the film, Andy was happy to use his talents to gain favor within that structure. In this sense, Andy's payback against Norton carries added meaning. Without being sexual in any way, this is the homosexual fantasy of revenge against a heterosexual power structure which imprisons and confines.Finally, after breaking out of prison, Dufresne organizes a reunion with his special friend Red by leaving cash and a letter, written in flowing script, in a tin box by a wall on a prairie. He has given Red instructions to locate the box with a compass, and Red uses the money to travel to Dufresne's secret location in Mexico, where the two men reunite on a sandy beach next to the ocean. This is how the film ends. Dufresne and Red finally find their homosexual paradise: a place where their love can be consumated outside of ""prison,"" i.e. where their homosexuality does not make them transgressors in the eyes of society.I fully realize this review is going to ruin my helpful/not helpful ratio as a reviewer. It needed to be said."	1.0	Homosexual Fantasy	2009-07-11	355	37	318

I love the story line.  It makes you stop and think about what you do, why you do it, you just think about everything. I do agree that the Green Mile is horrible, and no even comparable to this. I enjoyed Morgan Freeman's nice, pleasurable tone on the narration and I think Tim Robbins plays his part masterfully. It is very well directed and, even though it goes at a very mellow and slow rate, you never get bored. The characters are so interesting that you have to know what happens to them. There are lots of twists and turning points in the story, and the last half hour of this film is the most enjoyable half-hour you'll ever see. Go and rent this movie.

The video is very inspirational to me! Tim Robbins teaches us a story by acting in a role with such expertise, we can see in oursevles that we also have the capablity to beat all odds. Morgan Freeman shows us that through paitence, we can make the best of any situation. I don't usually like Stephen King.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ASCPTYFZ3RZZY	Jim Lantini	One of the reasons I enjoyed this film so much is how well it exemplifies life itself.  Sure most of us don't end up in jail, but we all struggle at times, we question, and we make one of two choices at that moment--as the film says: &quot;You either get busy livin' or get busy dyin&quot;....The director, Frank Darabont, shows what happens when someone gets themselves dealt a lousy hand in life, and rather than folding, instead, Andy Dufreane, chooses to challenge, what he sees and how he lives.  Stephen King, who wrote this short novel that the film was based on once said, :&quot;The more difficult life becomes, the more the human spirit has a chance to shine&quot;.  This is not a movie about things to do in jail when your bored, it is about the struggle that people face everyday, and the satisfaction and joy that come in the end when you GET UP, and get busy livin'.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1MX6D3JK6IKDW	J J BAGS	"After so many positive reviews already written, some personal observations.In the first place one does not readily identify Shawshank with the state of Maine. Evidently, author King did.Perhaps his mind works better in his home state. Freeman and Robbins finally get out; the revenge factor against a corrupt establishment is the key theme to the movie. But, what of those who never get out? Next, the realism of the movie is abeted by its brutality scenes, pictures of which one would rather deny. One would also assume in 2008, the likelihood of such a scheme succeeeding would be next to impossible.Yet,  reports of 3 million incarcerations at present in the USA makes one wonder. Finally, the movie is totally engrossing, leading to multiple viewings. The reason for this,I suspect,is probably different for every individual. Please take the time to mull over your reasoning.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1X1CEGHTHMBL1	jjceo	Andy Dufresne is drinking whiskey and holding his gun.  He is loading it while sitting outside the house where his wife is in bed with the local golf pro.  He claims that he sobered up and drove home and threw his gun into the river and didn't do anything.  Andy (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her boyfriend.  The evidence is not strong but he is still convicted to a double life sentence to be served sequentially.  They declare the act a horrific crime as the victims were shot 8 times and he had to reload the gun to do that and shoot them in the head.As he arrives to prison he is on a bus and the entire prison population is in the yard taunting those on the bus.  The prisoners are betting on which of the new comers will break down first.  The captain of the guards is Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) and he is tough on the prisoners and the warden, Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) is religious but he believes in punishment and lets Byron have his way in dealing out pain.Andy becomes friends with Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman) who is the main smuggler for the inmates to get them contraband items.  Andy wants a small rock hammer to hand make a stone chess set and he also wants a poster of Rita Hayworth for his wall.  Andy is a quiet man but he has a fire that burns within him, an intelligent mind and he has a plan.....This is simply the best conversion of a Stephen King novel to a movie that has been done.  The movie is also one of my all-time favorites as the storyline, directing and especially the acting is superb.  This little known movie should have won academy awards but it did not win any even though it was nominated for 7.  It is one of Morgan Freeman's and Tim Robbins best roles.  The written script is just flawlessly done.I really liked this movie and I recommend it to you.  I believe that if you haven't seen it then you will enjoy it.  It is entertainment at its best.	5.0	Put your trust in the Lord, your ass belongs to me!	2012-09-13	3	3	0

His presence soon becomes felt among the entire population of the prison, both convicts and guards, and how he turns the tables on his captors remains one of the better tales set to paper and film.	5.0	Outstanding	2013-05-20	2	2	0

My favorite part is when Ellis Boyd Redding (Red) appears before the parole board the last time. This movie is art, all pieces work to form the experience of a man wrongfully imprisoned, that overcomes the hardships of prison life and with precision, creates and executes an exit strategy.  Great entertainment! The movie has more of an adult theme and I would not recommend for kids.	5.0	I love this movie	2014-05-24	1	1	0

All you do is wait until he tries to  escape; the only exciting part of the movie.  The narration by Morgan  Freeman is just plain goofy.  When it starts, 'The first time I laid eyes  on him (Tim Robbins)...&quot; I thought, who cares what he is thinking.  Also  when Tim gets the free beer for some inmates, what's with him just sitting  there with that, that smile?  Have a beer you idiot, or join the  conversation, or relax, don't just sit there staring with that smile.  And  finally (DON'T READ THIS if you haven't seen it yet) what kind of ending is  it where two dudes are together on a beach.  Really sounds like fun to me.  And what would they talk about?  'Man jail really sucked...  Yep, it sure  did.'  On the positive side the classical music scene was excellent.  There's definitely much worse movies, but please don't buy this one.

Think back to when you were a kid.  If you're a guy, then you'll know all about our know-holds-bar attitude towards keeping away from the little girls, after all, they did have ""kooties.""  Well, remember that time you first discovered you thought little Jennifer or Emily was kind of.....cute? The other boys would pick on her and call her a kootie-face but you stood up for her, ever though it meant envoking the wrath of every guy-friend you had during that time.  Well, years later, when little Jenny or Emily grew up and became a complete hottie and she didn't forget the way you took up for you? Remember the feeling you had when everyday she passed you in the halls and gave you the smile that she saved only for you? Well, that's the way Shawshank will make you feel at the end: complete satisfaction my friend, complete satisfaction, even if it meant feeling low in some points.The film takes you into ...(or so it seems for Andy Dufresne) but before it's all said and done, leaves you on the doorstep of heaven, and just in time for the gate to swing open. Yes, this is one of those yummy films.In it, we can feel the complete desperation of Andy Dufresne(played perfectly by Tim Robbins) and we can see deep into his heart, witnessing his pain, his agony, and helplessness. Just about the time when we feel all's lost for poor Andy, we get to take one of the sweetest breaths of fresh air that a movie has ever handed out.  It's just plain tastey!The plot is the stuff of Pulitzer Prizes. Dufresne is accused of killing his wife, thrown in jail for life, and forced to deal with a group of corrupt guards, a gang of rape-minded prisoners, and a warden who is the embodiment of evil.  Sound like fun? Believe me, it is.Andy meets up with ""Red"" Redding(played magnificently by Morgan Freeman) and soon the two become very good friends.  After a few years of getting raped and abused by other inmates, Dufresne learns that his special knowledge(bank management) can go a long way in helping him keep from being assaulted anymore.  He helps the guards with their taxes and becomes the warden's assistant, only this means he has to deal with dirty money and soon, a dramatic climax develops.Hands down my favorite movie of all time, The Shawshankk Redemption(first set in the fourties) will leave you standing up in applause by the time the end credits role around.  The cast is electrifying, the plot flawless, and the musical score a complete gem(done handsomely by Thomas Newman).NOTE: How much do I love this film? Tons. Enough to go find out where it was really shot. Mansfield, Ohio, ladies and gentlemen, is the town where the prison actually resides. Every part of the film was shot in or around Mansfield and yes, I plan on going there very soon. ENJOY!"	5.0	Yummy! The most delicious film I've ever seen!	2002-08-16	3	1	2

However, I would like to go further, and suggest that Shawshank redemption is one of the worst movie's ever made. For starters, it's got Morgan Freeman in it. Morgan Freeman(this spelling may be wrong, but I don't care) is a man of limited talents: he can play a guy hunting a serial killer, and sometimes the president, but when he tries to act he's terrible. And you know I'm right.Two: The film is really boring, goes on forever, covers a span of decades yet the cast never age(Morgan freeman should be dead by the end), has voiceover to explain everything, is really sentimental, everything ends ridiculously happily, he escapes in a stupid way, it actually contains the tagline ""hope can set you free"" and so on and so on.Three: The film's star, Tim Robbins, actually said it was awful.

Robbins gives a masterful performance as the aloof, enigmatic inmate whom everyone--including the bulls--comes to respect. And Freeman brings his own Southern gentility to the role of Red, the wizened con whose bond with Andy takes him to a very unexpected place: the outside world. Excellent support from James Whitmore, William Sadler, Bob Gunton, and gorgeous camerawork by Roger Deakins makes this crowd-pleasing ""Redemption"" song worth hearing more than once."	5.0	The Shawshank Redemption	2007-07-17	2	2	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2Q7YBUV8IPTLW	John K. Reed	Wow!  No words can truly describe this incredible film.  I had rated this film as the best film I had ever seen until I saw The Thin Red Line which is another overlooked film and the only film that in my mind surpasses The Shawshank Redemption.  That these two films were passed over is reason enough to stop even having the academy awards.This film explores many fundamental questions about man's human nature and our society in general.  What is the purpose of our penal system?  How do we cope with adversity?  What is the measure of a man?  What motivates us?  What is beauty?  The list goes on and on.Prison life is harsh.  From the spartan living conditions to sadistic inmates to cruel guards and administrators.  But to me one of the ultimate truths that the film displays is that there is justice in the end for all although it may take a different form for each individual and circumstance.The power of persistence to overcome adversity.  The strength that we gain from each other.  The necessity to risk and challenge our own assumptions.  The choice to be miserable or positive.The direction, acting, story, cinematography, and soundtrack are just phenomenal.  This to me is one of very few truly devine films of all time.NOT TO BE MISSED!	5.0	Justice, injustice, redemption, depravity, despair, and hope	2001-05-04	1	1	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1VXWZU8LPF1BQ	John Marshall Furlong	The Shawshank Redemption is a movie I missed at the theaters.  I don't know why, but I just never got around to seeing it.  SR has developed a huge online following since then, and I've heard plenty of praise for it.  While the DVD contains no extras, I couldn't resist the price.  The other  reviews elequently describe this masterpiece.  But, I had to add my voice  to the choir and proclaim that The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most  terrific and uplifting films I've ever had the pleasure of seeing.  The  characters, story, everything is beautiful.  How this film lost out to  Forest Gump in the 94 Oscars, I'll never know.  SR will be regarded as THE  defining film of the 90's.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A23VGBG17K5NJ3	John Nolley II	One of the best screen adaptations of Stephen King's work to date, The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most powerful stories told by the grand master of horror, yet not a single ghost or gorey monster appears.  Instead, the story is a character film about a wrongfully-imprisoned man and his struggles with a life destined to be served out in prison.People obviously more wicked than he escape punishment, from the scheming warden to an overbearing top guard, while Tim Robbins' character must silently endure their evils as one who has already been convicted and sentenced as a wrongdoer; the juxtaposition of the imprisoned good men verses the evil ones looking after them makes for a story that draws in the audience and gives them easy identification with the main characters.Somehow this wonderful film slipped by me in theaters; don't let it pass you by on DVD as well.	5.0	An Excellent Character Film	2003-03-13	2	2	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A10EICDA6FL5VK	Johnny B. Quick	When The Shawshank Redemption came out in the 90s, I remember a friend telling me how great it is, so I went to see it in theaters. I loved it so much that I saw it a total of 3 times! I soon after bought the VHS when it was available and now I own the DVD as well.The Shawshank Redemption follows Andy Dufresne who is incorrectly convicted for murdering his wife and the man  she was cheating with. Andy has a hard time upon first entering prison as Bogs, a violent sexual molester often beats him up and rapes him. Andy befriends Red, a man who smuggles contraband for prisoners for money. When the warden finds out that Andy is great with numbers and was a banker before entering prison, he has Bogs paralyzed by Hadley, his main guard, and Andy begins working for Warden Norton. He has Andy create a fake person for which he can make a bank account to put all of his bribes in and money he steals from the prison. When a young man named Tommy enters the prison, he realizes he's previously done time with the man who really killed Andy's wife. Warden Norton will not hear it though as he believes Andy will reveal his scams, so he's sent to solitary confinement for 2 months and Tommy is quickly murdered by Hadley. Andy then decides he's had enough of prison and tries to escape although he and Red have become the best of friends.This movie shows viewers the harsh reality of prison and encourages people to stay away from it. It also shows that the law is not always correct and is sometimes flawed. Now my kids love this movie as I do.If you've never seen this movie then please do yourself a huge favor and watch it!!!	5.0	The greatest prison movie ever!	2014-03-24	0	0	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A25KOX07XK83A9	Johnny Five	Blu-ray begs the question: What would you rather watch, an average movie with mind-blowing visuals or a fantastic movie that doesn't stimulate your eyes as much as your heart?  In this case, we have one of the most well-written and perfectly-executed films in the history of American cinema formatted for a cutting-edge technology.  It looks better than it ever has (with maybe the exception of the original film but very few people saw it that way).  However, as a Blu-ray, the movie's transfer just doesn't stand out.  Some outdoor shots look fairly good, but a majority of the scenes will not amaze you.  It's not a bad transfer, but just an extremely minimal one.I bought this Blu-ray on day one because of my love for this film, and I do not regret that purchase.  The packaging and extras are pretty good (although a few of the extras are a little redundant and repeat information), and the movie looks better than it ever has.  The problem is, Blu-rays shouldn't just look better than DVDs, they should look vastly superior.  So, those looking for the best in HD home video, keep looking.  Fans of the film, however, shouldn't have a problem making this purchase.	4.0	Fantastic Movie, so-so HD transfer	2009-01-14	1	1	0

I am just not a fan of prison-type movies. So when my friend and I really didn't have anything to do one night, we ordered pizza and rented this movie. I was absolutely mesmerized from start to finish. It wasn't a prison movie at all! It was all about how the human spirit can survive and thrive anything that it is given. True, not all of us pull upon our inner resources, but this movie demonstrates the unalterable truth that there is something deep within us that can get us through anything.It is hope.Hope gets us to look just a little bit beyond the self-inflicted prisons we have all put ourselves in at one time or another. If we can just let a glimpse of something better take root in our mind, we will find a way out of any kind of situation we find ourselves in.Many of you are probably saying, &quot;Hey, dude...it's only a movie...&quot; And if you watch it as just another movie, you get what you deserve...but if you are willing to see it as symbolic and metaphorical of everyday life, I invite you to experience a very wonderful kind of film. It is absolutely lovely and magnificently crafted. Soul is indelibly printed on each frame of celluloid. I loved it...I love it...and you will, too!	5.0	Hope	2002-08-11	0	0	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1AT0GONN4A9NA	"John P. Morgan ""Light Coach"""	I have just finished watching The Shawshank Redemption for the 71st time. Every time I watch this movie I am drained yet positively inspired. Every time I watch this movie I feel empowered and strengthened. Every time I watch this movie, I feel a connection between the main characters of this story and my own heart.We've all been in prison in one way or another. Some people are behind steel bars and some people are behind invisible bars but do the bars make us or do they break us? In other words, is it what happens to us or what we do with what happens to us that matters?Andy Dufrane is sent to Shawshank for a crime he didn't commit. While there he suffers through the ins and outs of prison life and yet Andy learns to make the very best of it. He learns how to give out hope even if it is not received. He gives out hope because he still wants to feel normal...to feel human...to feel alive. He knows in the back of his soul that hope is the best of things and through hope, anything is possible.I resisted this movie like a bad disease when it first came out, but a friend and I rented it a year and a half later and we were absolutely mesmerized. You could say it was formulaic, you could say it was too long, you could say a bunch of [...]about it but it still does not diminish the powerful impact that this movie so freely offers. If you don't walk away from this movie feeling better about life, maybe you have given up hope...maybe you're still confined in a prison of your own making.Here's hoping you break free.	5.0	A Metaphor For Life	2006-06-08	6	6	0

This is an incredible film with a moving story and real, powerful characters. I am a big fan of Morgan Freeman and this is his best  performance. And when you are discussing Morgan Freeman that says a lot.  Also Tim Robbins is fantastic. His stoic and remorseful nature is so subtle  and moving. The film is based on a Stephen King short story and it is  written and directed by the writer/director of The Green Mile: Frank  Darabont. In both his sensitive writting and his beautiful shot selection  he has created a filmic masterpiece. FABULOUS!	5.0	One of the greatest films ever made!	2000-05-12	0	0	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1KCQ1ZCSCP1KN	Jonathan Coish	This movie is probably my favorite all time. It's absolutely beautiful, and the fact that it's based on an original story by Stephen King just blows the mind. I just love everything about it, the story, the music, the superb acting, the direction, everything. Morgan Freemans protrayal as Red is pure genious. ...  The music throughout the movie is also done very well, complimenting the scenes perfectly, especially in this last scene. I don't know why critics rag on the length, it's the perfect length. The story is developed perfectly, and without the long length of the movie the relationship between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins characters would not have been developed well enough to have the effect that it does at the end. This movie is absolutely amazing. It's the only movie to have made me cry from watching it numerous times. Usually movies might lose some effect after the first watching, but I find that this one has the same effect with every viewing. It's perfect, and is definately my favorite movie of all time!!	5.0	I'd give it 10 stars, but I can't!!	2001-07-21	0	0	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ABO1L7NICCUYZ	Jonothan Silverblade	"Good movie, but I've got two complaints:Firstly, I like sad endings - think Midnight Cowboy, Dog Day Afternoon, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest. I would have much preferred an ending where we didn't know for sure whether Red would meet up again with Andy. You know, as in its Red's SEARCH for Andy that is poignant, whether he actually FINDS his friend, or whether his search is futile - we're better off not being told.Why do you Americans need films with happy endings, anyway?Secondly, I loved the fact that we don't know at the start whether Andy is guilty or innocent. The episodic bit in the middle of the film - with the ""kid"" and the overheard jailhouse confession story that proves Andy innocent - spoils this ambiguity for me. The Andy character is much more complex when you don't quite know whether he's an innocent man (as he claims), or whether he's a good (but flawed) man who's been pushed passed his breaking point. Now, that really would be about ""Redemption""!"	4.0	Could Have Been Great	2005-11-22	12	2	10

While movies are supposed to be an escape from reality, Shawshank does the opposite by putting the viewer in a harsh reality with seemingly no escape from it...yet Andy Dufresne manages to find a way.While both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins had some memorable roles before and after this movie, their roles as Red and Andy, respectively, are career-defining roles.  In any time period, one can see those who have thrown in the towel after life has dealt them a harsh hand, while others hold onto boundless optimism in spit of the bad hand life has given them so far.  The dual story arcs of the prison break, combined with Red's conversion and redemption is a remarkable storytelling achievement.This movie has personally resonated with me ever since I first saw it nine years ago.  Any time I'm down, I'm able to remember and watch Shawshank and ultimately become inspired and full of hope again.  I'm grateful that this movie was made, and it's easily my favorite movie.	5.0	Fear can hold you prisoner...Hope can set you free	2009-10-09	2	2	0

A movie that will fill you with hope and joy, and make you cry, not from sadness but from happiness.  Truly a joy, Frank Darabont clearly loves the subject material as do the actors portraying the characters that Stephen King first brought to life with his short novella.

Leonard must be psychic, because no one I've experienced this film with has anticipated its sheer emotional impact.  Easily one of the best films Hollywood has ever released, Shawshank gave voice to anyone who has ever felt cheated, deprived or un-free.  Americans take freedom for granted and as a Cuban immigrant, this film resonated for me in ways I can't even begin to list!  From its memorable characters and incredible performances, to its shocking ending and impeccable production values, I believe Shawshank will eventually find a comfortable place on everyone's TOP TEN FILMS OF ALL TIME LIST if critics like Maltin really truly understood what an audience needs in order to feel connected and touched.  Critics of this movie, at least for me, lack an emotional connection that isn't scripted, but rather...FELT.  Disturbing, visceral, audacious yet real, and deeply touchingly grand, &quot;Shawshank&quot; blew me away.  Other, more celebrated flicks may have their moments, but as a complete whole, this is easily one of the most beautifully realized buddy-movies ever made.

DVD has once again presented these aspects in a  movie-theater-quality format, both picture quality and sound.  The extra  features on the DVD are abysmal, though - a major downside.

Although my vote would be for The Shining (a film he hates) I see what he means.  The novella, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, is one of King's ""non-horror"" works.  As such, director Frank Darabont doesn't fall into the trap that almost all other filmmakers do when adapting King's work: ignore characterization for cheap thrills.  One of the things that make Stephen King a great writer (and I mean this) is that his books are about PEOPLE.  He makes us care about the characters, and then we are frightened when they are put in jeopardy.  The movie, The Shawshank Redemption, succeeds because it is all about the characters - who they are, and the journey they take.The story is about an innocent man (Tim Robbins) sentenced to life in prison - well, two life sentences, actually.  He forms a friendship with a fellow-inmate named Red (Morgan Freeman) and uses his own natural resources to create a life for himself.  The film does differ from the source material in several ways.  Ironically, because of the shortness of King's story, more is put-in than taken-out.  The ending is changed slightly, but it works for the screen.  The message of the film (and the book) is that hope springs eternal.  ""Either get busy living or get busy dying.""  Considering the enduring popularity of the piece, it seems most people opt for the former."	5.0	Hope springs eternal...	2004-06-11	0	0	0

When Brooks lost it when his parole came through demonstrated how &quot;institutionalized&quot; one can get after so long in captivity.  I strongly recommend this to the strong at heart, for the authenticity of the violence is not for the weak stomach.

The character portrayal of Red did the book justice and the on going  struggle of the characters moved smoothly from one to another.  Has to be  Tim Robbins best.  One of the most interesting things about the film  is the fact that the main character in the film isn`t Freeman or Robbins  but Shawshank itself and the effects it has on each of the inmates and  wardens alike.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AX48UNXCP1HR2	Juan E. Duque	This movie was awesome! Great story, great characters an very good performances by Robbins and Freeman. You really get absorbed by it. The movie gets 5 stars from me.The DVD however does not. When I buy a DVD of such a good movie I want to see beyond the film, I want interviews, documentaries, and specially audio tracks with commentary by the director and/or main lead. This sadly was not featured and while production notes are at least something extra it is not something that you couldn't find on the web.So please DVD makers: in the future when making a DVD be sure to put real special features, otherwise it's the same as buying the VHS version. I know picture quality and sound are better on DVD but frankly that's not what I look for when I buy a movie.By the way, &quot;chapter selection&quot; does not count as a special feature. A DVD by nature should have a chapter selection.	4.0	DVD makers pay attention	2001-04-27	4	3	1

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1PJDT35TLD75E	"JulieC1971 ""Julie"""	I own many DVDs but, of all of them, only a handful can I watch over and over again. They are almost comforting, like and old friend who stops by to visit from time to time. I have known true stories much like the ones they tell, making them even more believable and appealing to me. The Shawshank Redemption is one of them. It is a story of friendship, hope and redemption - not only for Tim Robbins' character Andy but also for Morgen Freeman's character Red. I could listen to Freeman's mellifluous, deep voice narrate the story for hours. I was also truly impressed with supporting cast members like James Whitmore, who played the old convict Brooks, too thorougly institutionalized to make it on the outside.Comparing it to Stephen King's novella, I would say I prefer the film - and not just because of the dramatic scenes, the spectacularly eerie shots of the outside of the prison, the spine-tingling musical score or the fact that two of my favorite actors play leading roles. The sequential order of the film, the choice of all of the characters and the personality that the prison itself takes on have perfected King's (superbly written, by the way) work.This is without a doubt one of the best films ever made and it truly deserves the high praise it has received.	5.0	Even better than the Stephen King novella	2006-02-21	3	2	1

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2T6JOAC8SWXUV	Julie Reed	"The basic plot of this movie has been done many times, but never so well. Shawshank Redemption is the story of a quiet accountant named Andy Dufrane who is convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. The story takes place in Shawshank prison, where Andy must learn to defend himself from violent guards, and prisoners who take a more-than-friendly interest in him. However, these are only minor points in the plot, which focuses on the development of a unique friendship between Andy and a fellow prisoner named Red. Red is the prison bookie, but he also specializes in bringing in goods from the outside ""for a small fee"". The two first meet when Andy requests an uncommon item: a rock hammer, used to shape precious stones.Some say this movie is long and slowly-paced. I can't say I noticed. Perhaps this movie is slow compared to the average prison movie (which usually involves many murders and large-scale prison riots), but a faster pace would destroy the emotional context of the film. One of the major themes of Shawshank Redemption is ""A man will do almost anything to keep his mind occupied in prison."" That point wouldn't come across in a fast-paced movie.To me, everything about this film is great. It's brilliantly cast, has wonderful characters, and comes with a beautiful score to set the mood.  The plot is interesting and realistic, and the dialogue is fascinating. It also has plenty of humor to offset the sad/depressing events. I wouldn't recommend it to an adrenaline junkie, but for everyone else it's a must-see movie."	5.0	Don't Miss This One	2002-04-03	2	2	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ASXICXVWJWV5K	Julio A. Duarte	"Forrest who? The Academy got it wrong. The best movie of 1994 was ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" with ""Pulp Fiction"" a close second. The sequence in which Andy's secrets are revealed qualifies as one of the five most thrilling movie sequences I have ever watched. Nevertheless, the Hollywood moneymaking machinery spurned this movie in strict accordance to the golden rule, ""Thou shalt not give the Best Picture Oscar to a commercial failure."" At the time the movie was seen as a failure because it had not broken even during its theatrical release, but as millions of movie buffs around the world will enthusiastically remind you, ""Shawshank"" honored its message about the value of patience and endurance, by becoming a runaway word-of-mouth hit on video.I bought this movie on Laserdisc on an impulse, six and a half years ago, although I had not seen it and knew almost nothing about it. That was the most fortunate gamble I ever made. Now that I have practically discarded my old Laserdisc player, I bought myself a copy of ""Shawshank"" on DVD from Amazon.

Full of twisted characters (the warden), characters you love to hate (Hadley), the ones you just can't help but give sympathy for their situation (Brooks and Red), and the classic on the edge not sure what to think of character (Andy).

Tim Robbin's portrayal of Andy is spell-binding.  His voice is calm and even, almost monotonous, yet you see the wheels constantly turning.  The twists  at the end were especially clever.  Morgan Freeman's character, Red, was an  accurate example of a man in prison and his refusal to look for hope.  It  was also interesting to see how the once tough-in-prison Red became the  mild-mannered grocery bagger after his release, even forgetting that he  didn't have to ask permission to go to the bathroom anymore.

The film centers on those we encounter in life and assume to be the good versus those who we are predisposed to believe evil. Juxtaposed brilliantly, we clearly find our assumptions have been manipulated and even violated by the institutions we trust. It is a movie of redemption, but not in the manner one would predict at the movie's onset.	5.0	The villian is the villian's keeper	2009-08-06	3	3	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3CF7B2U0IB8PS	Katie	"Shawshank is one of those movies where you watch it, are amazed and like ""OMG THIS IS SO GREAT""... and then a few hours to a day later, you suddenly realize ""Well, I guess it wasn't THAT great.""  Overall, it's a good movie.  Definitely entertaining and very uplifting, even made me get teary-eyed sometimes.  But, there are some major problems with it....For one, it's so black and white.  The good guys, though rough on the edges, are still so incredibly good and likable that you are rather unable to imagine them having committed the crimes that they did in order to land in there.  The bad guys are people so stereotyped that it's ridiculous: the hypocritical, vindictive Fundamentalist Christian warden (he even had a freaking southern accent, what's up with that,) the brutal guards who only leave people alone whenever they get something out of it.I think a big problem was the decision to make Andy actually innocent.  If he had actually committed the crime, it could have been a lot better.  It would have been less ""System crushes an innocent man"" and more about the power of redemption.  It could have been like Dostoevsky... I guess they didn't think that people would be able to sympathize with a murderer.  So instead they rely on a crazy coincidence: it just SO HAPPENED that the night Andy was drunk and considering shooting his wife and her lover, they got murdered by someone else!  Wow!  Now THAT is timing!The part that was most ridiculous to me was when they killed Tommy.  Why wouldn't they let Andy get a retrial?  Why did they actually MURDER the kid and not just, like, threaten him or send him to an insane asylum or something?Another part that I found rather dumb was how Andy escaped.  I guessed from day one that he kept that rock hammer in the Bible; it's one of the most cliche stowing places of all time, so why wouldn't they check it during a cell inspection?  Wouldn't they also make sure that nothing was behind a poster?And I'd like to know how a former convict breaking parole could make it to Mexico.  Also, how the heck Andy got a suit to go to the banks in.Still, it's a good enough movie, it's just not a masterpiece.  It's something you should watch if you need a soulful movie.  One of the best scenes is when Andy blasts the duettino ""Sull'aria"" from Le Nozze di Figaro over the prison loudspeakers.  I also like how the ending made all little things throughout the movie completely pull together, almost like a Dickens novel.But overall, I just can't overlook those problems.  Why is it called the Shawshank Redemption if Andy is innocent?  And no one else was redeemed; from day one they were fine, upstanding people--like I said, you had to keep reminding yourselves that they were convicted criminals.  No need for redemption.I mean, don't kid yourselves, guys.  It's a good movie, but the story is no ""Crime and Punishment"" or ""Les Mis&eacute;rables."""	3.0	Good movie, but...	2005-10-15	38	7	31

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A34D4KCP94ACJZ	K. Driscoll	"It isn't always easy to find the words to describe a great film.  It is just that every ten years or so there is a film that lifts me up and forces me to take a deeper look at some facet of my life, in this case an understanding of value for my own personal freedom.  The Shawshank Redemption feels like a deeply personal film for me.  It gets under my skin and by its conclusion I want to well up like a big baby no matter how many times I've seen it.  I know that other people feel the same way I do about this film but I never approach them to ask why and I only sometimes decide to express a feeling like that in writing, like I am now.  The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare films that reflects something real enough that I can almost empathize with its characters for two hours, at least enough that I find a new respect for the life I have.  After all, no murderer is only that.  He or she is or was a son or daughter to someone; maybe a wife, a husband, a lover, or a best friend to others.  That doesn't make anyone's crimes more or less forgivable, it just provides more than a one-dimensional perspective on such profound character dynamics.  Redemption is a process by which the redeemed find enough comfort in whatever they have or whatever they've done that they can keep going again.  But this is not just a film about some men gaining atonement for their guilt.  It is far more than that; it is about survival and hope and I always feel a little sense of salvation myself every single time I watch it.Directed by frequent Stephen King novel interpreter and outstanding screenwriter Frank Darabont (The Green Mile,The Mist), The Shawshank Redemption is a film that takes place in the late 1940s at Shawshank Prison in Maine.  It follows two prisoners; Ellis Boyd Redding or ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), who has long known of the accountability he has for his crimes and Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a quirky banker serving two consecutive life sentences for the murder of his wife and another man, crimes he did not commit.  Andy is easy to root for as both an innocent man and a fish out of water.  His ethics, his honesty, and his moral character are crucial elements to a story taking place in a world of such corruption and guilt.  It is beautiful to watch and Robbins is so compelling.  Freeman truly becomes the redeemed and in the end he can only find his sense of hope and freedom in the ways that an innocent man, perhaps unwittingly, inspired him.This was actually not a huge hit in theaters and I didn't even see it until about three or four years after its initial release in 1994.  It was nominated for seven Oscars but was overlooked due to Forrest Gump, a film I can do without.  All of sudden it seems everyone is coming out of the woodwork to hail the Shawshank Redemption as one of the greatest films of all time.  It is hard to see any film from the last twenty years or so on lists next toCitizen KaneorThe Godfather, but I can't say it troubles me to see this particular film get so much credit.  The movie is emotionally powerful enough that it almost feels like a relative or an old familiar friend up there getting a round of applause and all the credit in the world.  I suppose I never expected anything less."	5.0	Extremely Satisfying and Inspiring Masterpiece	2008-04-14	2	2	0

The film was edited to  &quot;widescreen&quot; for theatrical release, which is known as Original  Aspect Ratio (OAR), which is what you will see if you view the widescreen  DVD or VHS.Instead of destroying the unused top and bottom portions,  which usually include information that the director deems unnecessary for  the picture, they included it in the full screen edition VHS. This is bonus  material and was not part of the original theatrical version. You are NOT  being cheated.	5.0	OAR - no rowing!	2000-06-14	5	5	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A325XMWVALXYZ4	Ken	This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. A lot of the reviews from people who didn't like it say it's predictable (what movie today isn't), and that predictability allows you to sit back and enjoy the conversations  that Andy and Red and the rest of the characters are having.The Movie  is not about somebody trying to get out of prison. It's about a man  overcoming the greatest obstacle in his life and never giving up.I think  most people who found it boring have an attention span about as long as  goldfish.If you didn't like it the first time, I suggest you rent it  again and watch it with an open mind and enjoy a true work or Art in Story  telling.	5.0	Wonderful Movie that just gets better each time you watch it	1999-11-05	0	0	0

Other reviewers have probably done a better job of explaining why.  All I know is that the visuals are superb.  The score is inspiring.  The acting is incredible.  Morgan Freeman is probably the best actor around, and Tim Robbins is one of my favorites as well as extremely underrated.  This is one of the few movies that my husband and I both love and that we watch over and over.  It never gets routine or boring - even already knowing all the twists and turns.  There is something new to discover each time it is viewed.  The characters are so well written and acted.

We also realize that Andy's calm, quiet exterior hides a great reserve of patience and fortitude, and Red comes to admire this mild-mannered man who first struck him as weak and unfit for prison life.&quot;  Overall I think this is one of the most entertaining movies of all time and has one of the best endings ever recorded on film.A+	5.0	One of the most incredible movies I have ever seen	2001-03-07	2	1	1

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3TH8OXYMQHFOU	KICKAZZDOOD	"By far, my favorite movie of all time. This movie had a deliverance that you wish were found in more films. Great story, great characters, great twists, great cast .. Everything can be found in this film. And I don't say that lightly.The story unfolds in 1947 when banker Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the ""bull queer"" gang ""the Sisters"" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston).In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library.In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias ""Randall Stephens"".In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package.What happens next , you will just have to watch !It's definitely WORTH THE WATCH if you haven't seen it.In fact, I am most confident that you will enjoy this one.More movies like this, please.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AJ674ZR8YKYLH	Kimberly E. Pomplun	This film sticks in my mind as one of the best movies I've seen for several reasons, but primarily because of the outstanding character and plot development.  Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, is a quiet man who was unjustly convicted of murder and sent to Shawshank State Prison. While there he meets Red, played by Morgan Freeman, who is a lifer and also the go-to guy if anybody needs anything from the outside world. All the inmates respect Red, including Andy, who feels completely out of place in the prison world. He knows that this is not the place for him, and it is his determined hope to eventually get out that causes him to persevere. He, too, eventually gains the respect of the other inmates, although he never fully connects with them. For him, prison is just a temporary station in life and he refuses to attach himself to any part of it.As the film progresses the audience is captivated by the developing relationship between Red and Andy. We watch them grow together and we can see the impact that they have on each other; we also watch expectantly as we view the impact that both characters have on the prison itself. The development of the characters draws us in-we feel personally connected to them and as twists in the story take place we are anxious to see what happens to each of these characters.As the story draws the audience in, we wonder just what will happen next. We see mini-plots emerge, including the story of one elderly prisoner who is released back into a world he hardly knows. Because the world has changed so drastically since he was first incarcerated and because he misses his friends so deeply, he takes his own life. His freedom just wasn't worth the loneliness he felt. Watching this, we wonder what will happen to Red and Andy if they are ever released. Will they feel the same way or will they be able to move on with their life? The overall dynamics of the storyline are so engaging that at the end of the film it is difficult to find closure. We are left wondering what is going to happen next. We want to keep following the characters and their story.This film is engaging, cleverly worked together, and wonderfully developed. Superb acting and an engrossing storyline are finely knit together to produce this masterpiece.	5.0	An engaging mastery of art	2005-05-05	5	3	2

It's a great movie that shows perseverance of one person who was wrongly convicted of a crime and spent 20 years in jail. It's a good example of what goes around, comes around and that good usually wins out in the end.

I think that this may be a story about prison life that in many instances is sadly true.  The story itself is not without its very strong messages - our favorite &#34;its time to start living or time to start dying.&#34;  After serious illness, my husband has taken that line in the movie to heart and we both see the quality of our lives unfold in a somewhat controlled way by the Grace of God and a series of choices that we all are given the opportunity to make.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2LCZYW6FBUS8O	"Knyte ""To The Stars"""	Until two weeks ago, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; was just one of those &quot;must-see&quot; movies I had never bothered to rent. After viewing it however, this film spoke to me on a level that I didn't expect at all. I just thought it was going to be a touching story about friendship. Yes, this *is* included, but there is more.Tim Robbins' character epitomizes the type of individual who usually succeeds in life. Not only is he gifted with above average intelligence, but he has an amazing work ethic. Yes, bad things happen to him in the film, but he doesn't let these things slow him down. He keeps going. He realizes that life isn't fair, bad things happen, and that we can either &quot;get busy living, or get busy dying.&quot;It was tremendously sad for me to see what happened to Brooks, the librarian. I for one, do not consider people who choose to do what he did to be &quot;losers,&quot; - a term I hear thrown around by insensitive types whenever the aforementioned subject comes up. But at the same time, I realize that he did make the wrong choice in that it was a total and complete waste. Our lives are a gift that comes with good and bad, but in the end we *do* have the power to make our own destiny. Even if it takes decades of suffering to make it happen.I'm choosing an angle when I recommend this film. My angle is this: there is something to be said for hard work and ingenuity. And if you aren't gifted with ingenuity, then align yourself with someone who is, and put yourself to work for that individual. Sooner or later, your work WILL pay off. Even if it's for an evil warden, as the film so brilliantly depicted. This is a film about choosing life over death.Life is too short to wait around for it to happen. We either &quot;get busy living&quot; or &quot;get busy dying&quot;. I get it now. Thanks.	5.0	A CINEMATIC CELEBRATION OF INGENUITY &amp; HARD WORK	2003-12-18	6	6	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2GPEV42IO41CI	Kona	This film is based on a Stephen King story and stars Tim Robbins as Andy, an innocent man who is sent to prison for life. At  Shawshank Prison, the cruel warden (Bob Gunton) and guards treat the convicts like animals. Their lives are filled with misery and hopelessness.  Andy's only relief comes from his friendship with fellow inmate, Red (Morgan Freeman), an old-timer who never expects to get out. Andy gradually adjusts to life at Shawshank, working in the warden's office and helping to get a prison library. Resourceful Andy has also been secretly working for years on a wild escape plan.With all the prison cruelty, this is a very painful movie to watch, but it has a hopeful and heartwarming ending. Robbins and Freeman have a great chemistry and are a pleasure to watch. James Whitmore has a small but touching role as a convict who gets released after spending most of his life behind bars. Although there are many scenes that make me cringe, I do like the movie and heartily recommend it.Kona	5.0	Intense and unforgettable prison film	2005-05-08	5	3	2

From Gil Bellows (who deserves stardom after landing the role of Tommy after Brad Pitt turned it down) to the tragic James Whitmore, ever-versatile Clancy Brown (who turned up to voice a dragon in the Cartoon Network series &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;), sinister Bob Gunton...and who can ever possibly forget the King of Hank Williams lovesick blues singin', multitalented and underrated veteran actor William Sadler, recently seen in the equally underrated &quot;The Battle of Shaker Heights&quot; and soon to play in the anticipated &quot;Wonderfalls&quot; dramedy on Fox?I love this movie and its observations on life, love, justice, and yes, redemption.  Some have criticized Warden Norton's character as Hollywood's continued assault on religion.  As Mel Gibson's PASSION OF THE CHRIST will undoubtedly prove, yes, atrocities have been committed in the name of religion, concealing human ambition.  I can think of no better argument for Christ in this film than Andy DuFresne and Red.  And lest we forget, Morgan Freeman played God in BRUCE ALMIGHTY.	5.0	Underrated but immortal	2004-02-20	4	2	2

And is a running contender for one of the best dramas I have ever seen. For those of you who don't know, the film is about Tim Robbins character getting sent to Shawshank prison for murder and the events that happen to him there. Including the people he meets, friendships he forges and tribulations he endures. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman absolutely shine and is easily one of the best movies in both of their long line of film credits.The movie really brings a message of hope and friendship and a good understanding of life behind bars. (at least in that time period of 1940's - 1960's) An excellent movie with an excellent message. One of those ""take what you can from it"" films that really stands out. 4 1/2 stars.The dvd is ok but I think they could have done a little better with it.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AZ0XWLDWVCS8R	Kyle Young	The Shawshank Redemption was a very strong and powerful movie.  This movie displays one mans triumph (Red, played by Morgan Freeman) of life through finding hope, given to him from a friend(Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins) while they were in jail.  The other main point is about freedom.  Andy demonstrates that freedom is beautiful for being wrongfully accused and finally escaping Shawshank (as well as basically overthrowing it)and living his days out in the tropical sweetness of mexico.Some say this is the best movie ever.  I ,however, disagree. But I can with certainty say that this movie was certainly an amazing movie with an amazing cast and not the least that this movie was only made over a book from one of the best authors on this planet, Steven King.If you are looking for a movie with everything, this has it, and although it might seem a little slow at times, you will understanf why in the end.

It has an excellent moral, and an excellent surprise ending.I recommend it for men and women, although you might want to watch the age of children viewing this show. There are a few brutal scenes in the movie (one depicting a gang rape of Tim Robbins' character) that are important to the story to show how awful life really is in prison; but they're not appropriate for younger children.Adults, enjoy the story of friendship, lies, and the redemption of an innocent man.	5.0	Remarkable Story About a Remarkable Man	2013-07-22	0	0	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A33SGA7BQ1X7XG	Laney Dee's	Stephen King's The Shawshank Redemption is one of the finest movies made in the last 25 years. Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman are superb in their roles as lifers at Shawshank, a prison which is run by an iron fisted but crooked warden. The Shawshank Redemption  is actually a actor about dignity, forgiveness and personal freedom and it is a Must-see movie for every human over the age of 12.

This Stephen King prison tale is excellent (as is his other prison tale The Green Mile).  Unfortunately, this DVD is lacking.  The only  extras on the disk are a trailer and a few photo stills.  Originally, the  disk was to include a commentary by Morgan Freeman, but he apparently  backed out.  With all the hype and acclaim around this movie, surely some  more extras could have been included.  Bottom line - Buy this DVD for the  movie, not to learn more about it through extras.	4.0	Great Movie, not-so-great DVD	2000-02-29	0	0	0

I absolutely love the story; basically it's the innocent man put through so much peril only to succeed in the end, but in this case, it's so much more..  the story has so many aspects to it, showing the various personalities and more importantly, showing us how people change as they grow older and (hopefully) wiser.Technically it's a good movie, nothing to blow your skirts up, but most definitely worthwhile.I can highly recommend this movie to everyone.	5.0	Classic movie..!!	2009-01-10	0	0	0

He was  wrongly accused of a double homicide he didn&#8217;t commit. He was sent to Shawshank prison and sentenced for life.  While Andy was at the courthouse he was questioned by the DA, being accused saying &#8220; You divorced your wife in the quickest way you could think of didn&#8217;t you? You divorced her with a 38. revolver wrapped in dish towels didn&#8217;t you&#8221; (pg.23)?  Even after he told his side of the story Andy was still considered guilty by the harsh judge.  In prison Andy meets a man named Red who quickly becomes his best friend.  Red described himself to the reader that &#8220; There&#8217;s a guy like me in every state and federal prison in America, i guess- I&#8217;m the guy who can get it for you&#8221; (pg.1).  Red gets Andy a rock hammer early one because Andy described himself as a man who liked to collect rocks.  Red asks Andy for the reason why he was sent to Shawshank prison and  he answers that he was accused of murdering his wife and wife's lover that he never actually killed.	4.0	shawshank redemption	2014-02-26	0	0	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A26121Q2DO7JX6	Laura	"Shawshank Redemption is the only movie I've ever purchased for myself where my kids commandeered the DVD and I subsequently had to purchase the soundtrack so I could listen to the music without watching the movie.  The masterful way the story is unfolded through a mixture of real time, flashback and narration by Red (Morgan Freeman) keeps you glued to the screen from beginning to end - even after having seen the film several times.  Though I appreciate and acknowledge Tim Robbins' restrained performance as Andy DuFresne and the fact that the supporting cast is consistently outstanding, this is Morgan Freeman's star turn.  His expressive face is always a pleasure to watch.  Every track of Thomas Newman's soundtrack is evocative and haunting.  Several other reviewers have mentioned the shots in the field near Buxton -- you can literally feel the heat shimmer off the screen (subtle background insect sounds here make this scene).  No other movie I've ever seen can touch Shawshank Redemption for consistent excellence and thorough attention to detail.Bottom line:  everyone who took part in the making of this film should feel deeply proud of what they produced, and everyone who wants to feel the power of human hope and friendship should see it.  I've tried to think of another film that I thought was as compelling and meaningful and the closest I can come is ""The Best Years of Our Lives."""	5.0	Best Movie Ever	2005-08-03	8	7	1

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A141K4HOXTWDA6	lenny	I look at anyone who didn't like this movie as if they just escaped from a warped mental institution.  The storytelling and quality acting make for a winning combination.  The experience is moving, and when you watch it from beginning to end, you'll have something to think about for a while.  Its upbeat message will pull you in all directions, and then eventually bring warmth to your soul.Andy Dufresne is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947, convicted of murdering his wife and her lover.  Within two months of his sentence, he meets friends, such as Red, who make up the little prison family that Andy grows accustom to.  Through his experiences, you'll see first-hand the hardships and emotional twists Andy must endure, as he finds himself coming to terms with his former life, and his current situation.The movie approaches the theme of institutionalization with a pinch of dread, as you come to realize how easy it is to succumb to the protective walls prison can bare, if given enough time.  True, the movie is long, but hardly ever drags.  You're always kept thinking, and if anything you'll be entertained, until the rousing climax.  And no movie's ending has ever captivated me as much as this one's has.How anyone could judge this film so harshly baffles me.  It's not special effects driven, and it's no horror flick.  But as some critics mindlessly claim, it grows beyond hollow, predictable routes.  At its heart is a deeply moving, heart-warming experience about friendship and hope.	5.0	The film that should be in everyone's top 10 list.	2001-08-10	8	8	0

This movie is powerful and touching for anyone.  Whenever it is run  on a late night cable channel for the hundredth time, anyone in the room  yells, &quot;Stop!

This is a film that might  not seem to be a good &quot;date&quot; film on the surface, but would  actually be the perfect mix of the emotional as well as the physical side  of movie-making.

I think I went back 2 or 3 times to see it again and cried at the end when Morgan (Red) is walking to meet his friend Andy (Tim Robbins) on the beach. This movie totally blew me away. The long length was even better because it made you feel as though you were incarcerated all those years as well. I felt I was an inmate in that evil wardens prison along with Red and Andy. Morgan Freemans narration is so spectacular and right on key that I think he should've won an Oscar just for his narration of this movie.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1JWKLW1FTG237	"Lindsay Movie Lover ""Lindsay"""	This movie is one that I rent and look forward to seeing every time.  It is one of those special movies that never gets old, and is such great quality.  The music is one of the reasons I have loved it so much. The composer, Thomas Newman, also did The Horse Whisperer, which had the same kind of haunting, gorgeous music throughout it too.  It helps to tell the story and is, in my opinion, perfect.The good parts by far outweigh the at times hard to watch prison life.  This is because the story is so inspirational and moving, that by the end, you forget about those bad times.  It examines and is a testament to the human spirit, and is told/portrayed so well that the end result is powerful.  The good times consist of the friendships between the men in the prison and the way they try to still hope and have good lives dispite of their situations.  Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, the main charcter who makes the prison break.  The times in the movie when he quietly, but at the same time loudly, defies the corrupt authority at the prison are very moving.  There is a scene where he broadcasts an opera record over the intercome of the prison, then everyone stops and listens, its really a beautiful moment and a powerful thought, that every human has to have hope to keep going in life.  This thought is the driving force of the movie and is worked to perfection.  Every aspect of the movie, the music, the circumstances, the dialogue, all confirm this notion and stand out throughout the film.Morgan Freeman plays Red, his friend he meets in prison.  His performance is just as good and his character just as important to the story as Robbins'.  The movie is narrated throughout using his voice, such a good choice for narration dont ya think?  The deep friendship between the two of them is another driving force for this movie.  It shows the bonds that can form between two people in these kinds of circumstances.  These two exceptional actors make this movie a real stand out in the films over the years.Bottom line, this is a wonderful piece of cinema that I am glad is so highly acclaimed and remembered.  It ranks very high up there in my favorites of all time.	5.0	The Shawshank Redemption: Fantastic Movie	2005-05-11	6	4	2

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AE3LTGPZH6LBV	Lisa Marie Engelken	The moving life of Andy Dufrane entered my life two years ago. When I saw this film, I instantly fell in love with it. Tim Robbins went beyond an actor and truly transformed into the quiet, well-mannered Andy Dufrane. Andy is hardly another prisoner at Shawshank, he is a genius with a dream of freedom in tropical paradise. This movie touches the heart, especially when Andy is roughed up by the 'sisters' and when he befriends 'Red'. The perfection of this movie, I'm afraid, cannot be described by words. How can one describe perfection?	5.0	Truly a Classic	2002-01-20	1	1	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3V6Z4RCDGRC44	"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t..."	"There are hundreds of reviews about The Shawshank Redemption in general, and its place as one of the finest movies ever filmed. This review of The Shawshank Redemption is specifically about its context in the American Film Institute's Top 100 listing.The first release of the AFI Top 100 came out and while it covered movies through 1996 somehow it did NOT have The Shawshank Redemption on its list. This even though the list had a variety of other movies that even most casual film-watchers would consider far less worthy. I suppose one could launch a wide variety of conspiracy theories about why. Is it because there were practically no females in the entire movie? That in the entire, long 142 minutes of film lines I think we have 3 lines total by a female voice? That can't be true, because Patton was on the AFI list and I'm fairly sure it had NO female speaking role at all. Neither did Platoon, with the exception of a female villager who briefly spoke in Vietnamese.OK, is it the rough prison atmosphere in general? I'd be hard pressed to say that was true. After all, they included A Clockwork Orange which has some pretty foul rape scenes in it. Pulp Fiction had bondage and male-rape scenes. So it's probably not that.But in looking at the original AFI Top 100 listing, pretty much the *only* film which features a key black character is Guess Who's Coming to Dinner which squeaked in at spot #99. That was it. And the portrayal there was extremely banal. I do love the movie, don't get me wrong. But the character was as ""squeaky clean"" as they came. Heck, we had more Native Americans in the AFI Top 100 than we had blacks.So then fast forward ten years, with everyone screaming about some of the choices they'd made with this first listing. Off went Guess Who's. And on came In the Heat of the Night. On came Do the Right Thing which in its wildest dreams didn't have anything even remotely close on the first list. And on came The Shawshank Redemption.Absolutely I feel The Shawshank Redemption *should* have been on the AFI list in the first place. And I'm pleased that it vaulted right into the #72 spot in the new revised listing. But it feels odd the way that it happened. I wish it had always been on the list, and that it hadn't seemingly been part of some of this on-and-off behavior.Still, with that all being said, clearly the movie is incredibly well done and well worth watching. Highly recommended.Rating: 5/5"	5.0	A Fantastic Movie	2012-09-21	3	3	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3B90F5YX0SU0N	L. Johnson	"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made.  The acting is incredible, the characters are great, and the story is gripping.  Tim Robbins, who plays the main character, Andy Dufresne, does an incredible  job.  He plays the heroic role of Andy to perfection, gaining the  audience's sympathy and respect, while capturing their hearts with every  step his character takes.  While Robbins is great, though, Morgan Freeman  is the one who steals the show in my eyes.  His narration adds a lot to the  movie, as does his overall portrayal of Ellis ""Red"" Redding.  To think that  he didn't win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor is truly mind-boggling.  Together, Freeman and Robbins have incredible chemistry, and make for one  of the best on-screen duos in recent memory.The story is a great one.  Without giving anything away, I will only say that although this is a  rather lengthy movie (bordering on 2 and a half hours), it is time well  spent.  There are highs and there are lows; there are offensive points,  such as excessive swearing and sexual innuendos, but nothing in the movie  is done without purpose.  As Freeman's character puts it during the movie,  ""prison is no fairy tale.""  When you watch this one to the end, you'll have  an appreciation for the realism that was presented within the film.This  movie isn't just for those who enjoy prison movies; almost everyone who  sees this movie will have an appreciation for it on some level.  The  Shawshank Redemption is a great one, folks; the fact that it didn't win  Best Picture at the Oscars is truly a shame.  If you have managed to avoid  watching this one so far, don't put it off for another day.  Rent it  immediately, give it a watch, and I think that you'll find it difficult to  resist buying it.I would also recommend buying the DVD of this movie if  you have a player to accomodate it.  It is admittedly short on features,  but the picture is incredibly crisp and clear, and the sound comes through  brilliantly.  Don't shy away from buying this one unless excessive features  are a must for you."	5.0	Absolute greatness	2000-06-20	12	11	1

It is one of the few films I can watch over and over and, except for a few harrowing scenes (which are nonethless essential to the story) I enjoy each time.  The story is inspirational, the writing is crisp and the cinematography is superb.  If anyone had told me, before I'd first seen this movie, that a film set in a prison would become one of my all time favorites, I'd have thought them insane, but it is that good.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3EKLO0WDCM01F	L. Wimberley	It has been a week since I saw this movie for the first time, and it still has lingered with me.  Very rarely does that happen anymore.  This movie is based off of the novella written by Stephen King (Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption).  I am an avid Stephen King reader and fan.  I had read the novella, and very much enjoyed it.Those who read books (especially Stephen King books) know that very rarely, are the movies based on books made correctly.  Very rarely, are the movies based on books enjoyed at the same level as the books, because one cannot simply film a book.  One cannot capture the same feelings, the same depth, the same character development and emotions that a book depicts, and that is why so many movies based on books are dissapointments.  Even more rarely, are the movies based on books considered to be 'just as good as the book'.I have never said this about another movie before in my life, and probably never will again, but the movie version of the 'The Shawshank Redemption' was in fact, 110% better then the book.  Yes, you read that correctly.  The novella itself was very short.  Coming in at around 100 pages, it was an extremely quick read.  I personally felt the movie opened up Red's character more, and made the viewer relate to Andy a little more, and allowed room for more sympathy.After the credits began to roll, I had a lump in my throat and a feeling that just hasn't shook from me in the past week.  Everything about the movie was done... just right.  It was a quiet, gentle, yet harsh and sorrowful movie.  Imagine recieving TWO life sentences for a crime you did not commit.  I can't even comprehend it.  One of the best things about this movie, is the fact that it makes you share these feelings with the characters.  The lonliness, the sorrow, the anger, the hope.Tim Robbins has given one of the finest performances I have ever seen in an American movie.  Morgan Freemans performance and narration are top notch as well.I live in Cleveland Ohio, which is about 50 minutes from Mansfield Ohio.  Mansfield Reformatory was the jail that Shawshank was filmed at.  You can take tours of the enormaous abandoned building that has been standing since the late 1800's.  The building in it of itself is amazing, bursting at the seems with history.  I had taken a tour last summer, before I saw the movie.  I appreciate the prision a lot more now, and feel grateful that I live so close so that I can make another trip this summer.  They have props everywhere from Shawshank hanging around.I am glad to have watched this movie. It has made it's way into my top 5 movies of all time list.  It will take your breath away, and make you stop for a minute and just appreciate everything you have.	5.0	A rarity	2005-04-30	3	2	1

There is over 2 hours of total bonus content plus an audio commentary. Surprisingly, this film was a box office disappointment upon its original release yet it is well worth owning. It is one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story and was nominated for 7 Oscars. It is also the #1 ranked movie at IMDB.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2M1B750OV0PXR	"""maelstrom1"""	The Shawshank Redemption definitely ranks in my top ten favorite movies of all-time. It is an excellent movie that stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a bank manager who has been convicted of murdering his wife and sent to  serve out a life sentence in Shawshank prison. He quickly meets an inmate  named Red (played by Morgan Freeman) who helps him through some of the  struggles of prison life. Between frequent beatings by the  &quot;Sisters&quot; and isolation, Andy Dufresne makes it his will to  survive. This movie isn't so much about prison life as it is about life in  general, which is what makes it so good.The screenplay was  well-written, based upon the Stephen King novella &quot;Rita Hayworth and  the Shawshank Redemption&quot;. In my opinion (some people will disagree)  in this particular case, the movie is better than the book. The story is  slowly laid out before the viewer and certain incidents are introduced  throughout the movie that show the integrity of Andy Dufresne as well as  his ingenuity (i.e. doing taxes for the prison guards). It helps if you pay  attention to every little detail since they all collectively contribute to  the turning point or climax.Without a doubt, the best part of the movie  is the climax, which occurs near the end. I was totally taken away by what  was revealed and I hadn't even expected it. You will definitely need to  watch the movie to find out what happens here -- don't let anyone ruin it  for you by telling you ahead of time.Overall, with the great story,  good casting and acting, and an interesting soundtrack, the Shawshank  Redemption is a classic movie that should not be missed. After I saw it on  T.V. I went out and bought the movie and have watched it a number of times.  Highly recommended for anyone as it tells a great story about life,  struggle, and redemption.	5.0	An excellent movie about one man's quest for redemption	2000-05-23	6	5	1

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX	magellan	I just had a few comments. One interesting thing about this movie is that it occasionally shows up as the #1 movie on lists of the 100 top movies of all time--a movie that many people probably wouldn't have thought of for that rarefied honor. But whether or not it deserves such an august place in movie history, there is no doubt that the Shawshank Redemption is one of the most engaging and memorable films of recent years, and perhaps of all time. It's one of my favorite movies, and one of the few movies I have been able to watch more than once. For me, that's extremely rare and is another indication of how good the movie really is. The movie has a great story, great acting by Robbins and Freeman, and a great ending. You can't ask for much more in a film, and whether or not I would vote it the #1 position or not, I think The Shawshank Redemption is truly a superb movie and good enough to be on any serious movie afficionado's must-see list.	5.0	A few comments	2002-09-11	3	3	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A17UXXQRJUD0I4	"Maizie Lucille James ""Still learning"""	"There have been many excellent reviews of the award winning movie, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.Most reviews of this film adaptation of Stephen Kings short story, allow readers a glimpse of how the main character [played by Tim Robbins] finds eventual 'redemption' despite the horrors he suffered when convicted then incarcerated for twenty years for a murder he did not commit.Many of America's top movie critics and other reviewers point out repeatedly how Robbins' character, Andy, clung to hope - a hope, which in the end was dramatically depicted through his courageous escape.  And to a lesser extent, the notion of 'redemption' was also realized by the character, Red, played superbly by actor, Morgan Freeman when he remembered the words of his friend, Andy - ""Get busy living, or get busy dying.""Yet, less often did we read about a more troublesome type of 'redemption'. And that was the 'redemption', which was borne of despair and which sent character Brook Hatlen [played admirably by veteran actor James Whitmore] to his death.I've participated in counseling for the elderly; seniors who when faced with loss of purpose, loss of belonging, loss of the ability to remain minimally independent, and who suffer loss of health/spouse/family, etc., the pain of despair sets in.  For many of the elderly, this sense of loss often becomes grave, and it becomes all consuming in the depths of their souls.  Then, many become emotionally tormented because their despair becomes devastating for the human spirit to thrive - at the moment when they acquiesce all 'hope'.Finally, gripped by fear and the pang of loneliness, the desire to 'give up'; to die  becomes both urgent and intense.  And, it is in this context that the character Brook Hatlen [through surrender] found 'redemption' - paradoxically, AFTER he was freed from Shawshank.How tragically sad.Maizie JamesApril 12, 2009"	5.0	Hope vs Despair At SHAWSHANK	2009-04-11	2	2	0

He goes to prison and meets friends and wants to  make them happy, so he gives the warden some financial tips, if he can give  his &quot;Co-Workers&quot; some beer. He says yea and soon he is the  prisons banker. He does everything for them but is really just planning  revenge. I highly reccomend this great movie.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1IANEBSMVGHS9	"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny"""	As of this writing, it's been ten years since the release of this now-classic, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, and it doesn't show any signs of aging, much like the soul of the main character, played by Robbins, who remained intact through his tenure in the Shawshank prison in spite of having been locked away for life (for two life terms, actually, something I've always had a hard time understanding...)The movie, much like &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou&quot; a few years later, takes place in a time and in a setting that would not initially raise too many &quot;suspicions&quot; about its high caliber. The performances thrown by both actors are supreme, with a friendship like few I can recall on the screen building up throughout the story. The script is simply brilliant (can't give much away without spoiling it for those readers who still haven't had the privilege of watching it)... and there was a moment that I will always take with me (and this was waaay before a similar moment also became a classic in &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot;): when Andy plays a sublime aria on the speakers of the prison, and everyone shut up, dropped what they were doing and turned around quietly to almost contemplate the sound of the two Italian singers singing away their souls, making those prisoners forget about everything else if just for a few moments, feeling free in their hearts.This movie will be close to my heart always and it is one that I can recommend with my eyes closed once and again.

He befriends inmate Red (Morgan Freeman) and a few others at Shawshank prison.  It's also astonishing that as I write this review I realize that even its basic synopsis would make it difficult to sell someone on seeing this movie.  This is simply more proof that a film can withstand the test of time and garner a status as ONE OF THE GREATEST AMERICAN FILMS without needing a marketable title, marketable premise, or bankable director and actors.  The Shawshank Redemption spread like wildfire by good old-fashioned word-of-mouth.  It became a phenomenon back in 1994, and here it is again, on an impressive 2-disc DVD Special Edition.  Imdb.com's readers have voted this the second best movie of all time, behind only The Godfather.  That's pretty impressive company right there.I wonder if the feeling I had when I first viewed the movie is similar to others'.  I felt during the first act that this would be just another prison drama, formulaic and trite.  Then by the onset of the third act, I was completely engrossed by phenomenal acting and directing, unexpected friendships by the characters, and a satisfying finale (don't worry, I didn't give away anything).See it for yourself.

Brody	It's a rarity in the movie world that a movie can take you on the emotional rollercoaster that &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; takes you on.  It's unquestionably the greatest movie of all time, for a variety of reasons.Great storyline.  A man who has been stripped of his dignity by his cheating wife is pushed even further down when he is convicted of murdering his cheating wife.  In prison, he's raped and beaten daily for several years, put in &quot;the hole&quot; for a month, and tortured in inhuman ways.  Despite the hardships, Andy keeps his head on straight enough to devise a master plan to escape from the prison that no one could ever escape from.Great acting.  Morgan Freeman as Red stole the show, and Tim Robbins as Andy was equally impressive.  Bob Gunton as the Warden gave a steller performance, as he truly made you hate his guts in convincing fashion.Great setting and screenplay.  At the Shawshank, it always looked dark, dreary, and cold.  It was almost as if the Shawshank had control of the weather patterns and the climate.  It wouldn't have had the same effect if they showed the inmates basking in the sunshine, and getting tans while out in the yard.It boggles my mind that anyone could give this movie a negative review, but it just goes to show that even when you're close to perfection, you still can't please everyone.  This movie is as close to perfection as Hollywood has ever come.	5.0	Greatest Movie of All-Time, Hands Down	2003-12-21	0	0	0

Morgan  Freeman and Tm Robbins both do absolutely fantastic job.I could  reccommend this movie if it was being sold for $40, but at $14 all I can  say is go pick it up right now.	5.0	What an uplifting movie.	2000-05-28	0	0	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3JBJSKB2HG6FH	Mark Greenbaum	We all know Shawshank is one of the best movies of all time, and many of the reviewers have well-described why, so I won't bother rehashing the movie.Rather, I would like to air my puzzlement and irritation with Castle Rock for not releasing the movie in a special DVD set filled with extras.  It seems that basically every_single_movie that comes out -- mostly garbage films no one has even seen in the theaters -- gets its own 2-DVD set.  Conversely, one of the most popular films of the last generation has been relegated to a limited, basically empty DVD version for nearly 10 years.Shame on the production company, and I plead with them to re-release Shawshank to give it the glory it is entitled to and give Shawshank's many fans a better product.	5.0	One of the best films ever, but where's the special DVD set?	2004-01-22	0	0	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A36EW68H08UOCS	"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!"""	"The Shawshank Redemption has a couple of violent parts in it, and a little bit of rough language, BUT - if that's not an instant disqualifier for you it is also one of the best movies you'll ever see.  I don't agree with those who voted it on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB.COM) the #2 film of all time - ahead of Casablanca and everything but ""The Godfather"", but it's still a dang good thing to watch.Tim Robbins' Andy Dufresne is that rarity of a prison inmate - he actually HAS been unjustly sent up river.  To make matters worse, the warden at his prison (Bob Gunten's Warden Samuel Norton) is a sadistic troll of a man.  But Andy has intelligence and patience, and much of the film is about how Andy comes to gain the respect of his fellow inmates as well as the Warden.  Andy is a financial wiz and he makes the Shawshank Prison a money-making enterprise for the Warden.Morgan Freeman is wonderful as Red, a prison ""Lifer"" who carries the weariness of his life matter-of-factly and befriends Andy.  I'd love to tell you the story, but that would detract from the pleasure of discovering it yourself.  You know that feeling that you get when you're sitting down to a favorite meal - you just KNOW it's going to be good.  If you haven't seen ""Shawshank"" before and you like movies, that's the way you should feel.  At the end of the movie I have that same satisfied, ""I'm Full"" feeling that I'd have after a nice Lobster dinner topped off with a slice of Cheesecake.  This movie sticks to my ribs.---------------------------------------------------Coming out of ""The Green Mile"" my sister-in-law remarked ""Boy, that was a good story!""  My brother, knowing it unlikely that she would know who wrote the original story, decided to have a little fun with her.""Did you know that the same guy who wrote this story wrote 'The Shawshank Redemption'?"" (Shawshank is a favorite among everyone I know who has seen it.)""Wow"", Sis replied.  ""That guy should write some more!""The last time I checked Stephen King had written something like 100 books and about 65 of them had been turned into movies."	5.0	An Uplifting Tale of Redemption	2004-09-07	16	8	8
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2I41UQ06KC72F	"Mark Petticord ""Mark Petticord"""	"In the fictional movie, The Shawshank Redemption, a must see for every student of success, the main character Andy never gave up his dream of freedom. Even in the midst of the worst circumstances while serving a life sentence, convicted of a crime he did not commit, Andy had hope.  According to Red, Andy's friend, everyone is innocent at Shawshank. Red thought, hope and the dream of freedom was a pipe dream.  Andy, believed and had faith in his future.During a pivotal point in the movie, Andy asked Red, ""Do you think you will ever get out of here? "" Red responded: ""Yeah when I'm old and gray with a few marbles rolling around in my head."" Red went on to say, ""I don't know if I could make it on the outside, I'm an institutional man.""  Like the other prisoners, Red had become institutionalized by years of incarceration. After a while, prisoners at Shawshank accepted their lot in life, stopped dreaming, and eventually even feared the prospect of being paroled.Doesn't this scenario ring true in the lives of many people? Many become institutionalized and begin to feel comfortable, secure, and even dependent in their personal prisons. They accept a false security. Their prison could be a job or circumstance that they just accept as their lot in life and give up hope. Andy, on the other hand stayed busy and productive. He made friends and alliances, even with prison guards in order to advance his plan for freedom. We have heard the saying; You can't steer a boat that's not in motion. Andy kept his hope and dreams alive and made the best of his present situation while learning from his past.  But he kept advancing toward his prize.Andy spoke one of his last lines during a pivotal scene in the movie; ""Get busy living, or get busy dying.""  Whatever condition we find ourselves in, it all boils down to our ability to choose our attitude in the midst of our circumstances. We have to keep our eye on the prize and our vision of the future. It's a simple decision to live, dream and hope or just give up and die a slow painful death. I choose life.I watched The Shawshank Redemption in 1994, the year I escaped from my personal Shawshank. I remember those words as clear a bell. ""Get busy living or get busy dying."" Even before seeing the movie, knew I'd eventually die in my job, figuratively speaking.  So starting in 1987, I made a decision to escape and methodically plotted out my exit strategy.  I gained my freedom -- It took seven years.  A year later I broke out my wife and we have enjoyed our freedom for the last15 years.According to Red, ""there's no use for hope on the inside, it will drive a man insane."" I think it's insane to stay in a circumstance that imprisons you and causes grief and regret.  Even if you accept the circumstances or just get used to it, you will never achieve the results you desire. Rita Mae Brown's classic quote defined insanity as; ""doing the same things and expecting different results."" [...]"	5.0	Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying	2009-04-14	3	3	0

(Kinda like *the Green Mile* - but that film was positively awful :(Overall, I liked *The Shawshank Redemption* - key word &quot;liked&quot;.  It was entertaining, interesting, I tolerated its overly-sugary and sentimental nature well (this movie is kinda like a bowl of Fruity Pebbles for the soul :) but ....... parts of it were stupid however; no big thing.  So for me that makes it an average movie.My personal suspicion is that as those who thought this movie to be a five star gem become less depressed and in need of sugary sentimentalized &quot;hopeful&quot; stories, they will see this movie more objectively and not as &quot;the greatest and most perfect film ever in the entire history of movie-making.&quot;  It will be less of an emotional rescuer or pick-me-up for them, and thereby they will be less prone to idealize and deify this movie and heap accolades on it.Or maybe I just need to be more emotionally in need of inspiration and hope in order to get this &quot;remarkable&quot; film.

I was told by many people to watch it long after the release. Finally I broke down and rented it. What an amazing movie. Tim Robbins is intelligent in every movie he does, but this one is at the height of his career. Tim Robbins potrays a man wrongfully accused of killing his wife and lover. Through his many attempts to prove his innocence, none have worked. He befriends Morgan Freeman, a man that knows the streets and the ins and outs. Their friendship provides strength to get through the many years they serve in prison. Excellent movie, excellent ending, a must have.

I don't care how good of &#34;buddies&#34; a con may be with the administration/guards, there is no trust of this magnitude between them. And since Stephen King didn't develop trust between Andy and the Warden, this story line make NO sense.And since Shawshank Prison is supposed to be in Maine - WHERE'S THE SNOW? My sister-in-law if from upstate Maine and they have snow eight to nine months per year. At least there should have been some on the ground.It was such a good story to ruin by such sloppy development.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2BMHF4YS37B6S	Matt	This is my favorite movie not only for its creation of a vivid, enthralling microcosm, but for the profound wisdom of its theme.  Stephen King wrote the novella that inspired this film, and as a sort of tagline to  his story (featured in a group of novellas entitled Different Seasons), he  included the quote &quot;Hope springs eternal&quot;.  This film translates  the heart of King's message with wonderful fluidity and fills characters  otherwise left to the imagination with actors perfect for their roles.  Morgan Freeman and Time Robbins are undeniably convincing, and the often  brutal and savage aspects of their prison life are counterbalanced by the  humanity with which they embrace their roles.  This film is truly great.  It portrays how the human spirit has the ability to transcend the ugliness  which can so often imprison the soul.  It is a superb story of suffering,  hope and the strength of unwavering determination.	5.0	An Epic Film	2000-01-13	1	0	1

The movie is extremely faithful to the short novel, and the few departures are just right. Everyone does a good job with the acting, and the dramatic prison escape in the ending is tear-inducing. There is some restraint on the triumph, as the old men who leave prison are different from the young men who entered. And the division of good prisoner/bad guard was a little too stark to be believed. Overall, though, this is a good movie that has something to say.	5.0	One of Stephen King's best gets royal treatment	2005-01-04	1	1	0

Despite a fairly formulaic plot, based on a Stephen King book, it's still a great movie.  People say that voiceovers are one of the ultimate cop-outs in movies.

The fact that the word &quot;long&quot; was often used to describe it kept me from viewing it since its release in 1994.  I finally sat down and popped the DVD in this  morning.Wow.  This is an incredible film.  I was incredibly moved by  the soul of this film.  The story is so human and has so many themes that  made me reflect on my life.  I bawled during and after viewing the film.  The performances are excellent.  And the director has crafted a riveting  film.  There are times you really wander &quot;What the heck is going to  happen next?&quot;, which is quite amazing for a &quot;prison&quot;  film.Lastly, I found that SHAWSHANK did not manipulate me or over  exaggerate the bad guys as most American films are guilty of.  This is a  smart film that tells a soulful story.  There are great twists and turns  that the main characters go through.  And the truths at the heart of this  film are expressed simply and with care.The DVD presentation is very  good.

The story is compelling, and tells of a man, Andy Dufresne, wrongfully convicted and committed for a murder he did not do, but he uses his intellect and the help of a friend he made in prison to survive and even in some ways thrive within the system. He even goes so far as to be of help to the Warden and various police officers, and helps various prisoners better themselves and find something useful to do while they're stuck within the four walls of the prison.Of course, there are problems to deal with, such as being bullied by a particularly vicious inmate, but so many inmates have come to appreciate Andy so that these men will not tolerate anyone trying to harm him and help him whenever they can. However, he also has to deal with a corrupt Warden who actually destroys his chance to get out of prison when evidence of his innocence is brought up. In the end, Andy has to rely on himself and his intellect along with what he has accomplished in prison to beat the system.This is a solid, stellar film which I cannot recommend enough.

Dunn	I have &quot;experienced&quot; this movie about 10 times on VHS, and I laugh, cry and fall more in love with this movie with every viewing.  While some movies lack in certain catagories, Shawshank Redemption is perfectly  written and directed, the casting is perfect, the acting is perfect, the  cinematography is perfect and any other catagory I am forgetting is  perfect.  Ask anyone who has seen the movie, and the worst response you  will ever get is &quot;that was a very good movie!&quot;Now I know  Loenard Maltin is a complete moron!  If ANY of the movie was cut out, you  would not fully enjoy every hidden meaning.  Believe me, If a movie EVER  wrapped up in a perfect ball, this would be it!I have over 100 DVD's in  my collection, and my collection is nothing without Shawshank Redemption  (or Braveheart for that matter)!I am going to pre-order now and hope  that this is not just another damn rumor! ;o)  Do yourself a favor, and go  rent it now and buy it later so you can watch it whenever you want to smile  from head to toe!	5.0	One of the best movies EVER!!!	1999-05-23	1	1	0

This movie had all the components to make an excellent classic.The actors-Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, were GREAT.  Robbins and Freeman prove great allies and friends in this movie. Unlike  other films I truly believed these two had a genuine friendship.The  plot was amazing. Focusing on the story of a man wrongly imprisoned for the  murder of his wife. The story continues as the man continues through his  years in prison and eventually his unconventional way of getting out.I  recommend that everyone who loves great films should see this movie. It  will renew your faith in the human spirit.	5.0	Nothing is greater than the Human Spirit	2000-07-17	2	1	1

I am not much of a book reader, but the ending reminded me  of a book called Ten Little Indians by Agatha Christie. Morgan Freeman was  especially funny in this movie.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AMG2LF8MLUDN1	M. Fields	"Excellent Picture!  The story revolves not so much around prison life as it does the friendship that developes between Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and Red (Morgan Freeman) and some of the other inmates.  Sort of a woman's movie for guys.  Dufresne has the usual troubles in prison but there's one major item that looms in the air.  He really is innocent.  Robbins gives a good performance here.  He still speaks through his teeth.  You know how he does when he's got a serious scene.  I must comment though.  Morgan Freeman steals almost every scene.  He has developed his craft like an old master.  He is one of todays best actors and I believe he is still very underrated.  He can easily carry a starring role with no problem.  I do wish that Hollywood would stop using him as a second banana.Bob Gunton as the bible toting, evil, crooked warden, Samuel Norton, does an exquisite job with his role.  He is deliciously evil.  You can't wait to see him get what's coming to him.  As evil as he was though, he did have a real fondness for Andy.  As long as Andy didn't cross him things were okay.  Guntons's performance works because he is evil but still adds some good qualities deep inside.  Way deep, deep, deep inside.  Some folks say the movie is too long.  I strongly disagree.  The length is necessary as the story is about the passage of time in prison.  These men are supposed to be ""lifers.""  You can't do that in a half hour of film!The cinematography is beautiful.  As the picture begins, the helicopter shot of the prison passing below along with the scoring is picture perfect.  It's a lovely shot.  The score is beautiful.  My favorite shot is another helicopter shot of Red and Andy after they are released from prison.  Andy tells Red where to find him if he's ever released.  He also tells Red to go to a spot where He's left some money for Red.  He finds the money, breaks parole and buys a bus ticket out of town.  Red arrives to find Andy on the beach trying to restore an old fishing boat.  As the two men lay eyes on each other the music is playing and the shot pulls back further and further.  There is no dialogue here.  Just two old friends embracing each other as the copter shot pulls back further still.  It's as if the intention is not to intrude on this personal, private moment between these old friends.  I have to admit I sometimes watch that scene again and again.Freeman narrates the film.  We are seeing the story through his character's remembrances so it's appropriate.  He does so without being over emotional or sappy.  This film can be watched again and again without it going stale.  There is some prison stereotype behavior but it is easily overlooked in this well acted drama.  Casting was very accurate all the way around.  What a shame that no Oscars were handed over to anyone involved with this film.  Please don't let this one get away.  It's a real gem.  Well directed.  Bravo!!"	5.0	If I only had more stars to rate with!	2004-11-29	6	6	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3NQPYWQF9BHQI	mgriffis@iccbpi.com	Occasionally, Hollywood spits out a quality movie like this one.  They are stories of survival, survival of the fittest.  Andy and Red were survivors.  In the end, they both realized their hopes and dreams.  It's no mistake  that they picked the most ominous and scary prison they could find.  The  filmakers want you to feel that there is no hope in a place like that.  They want you to feel that any inmate sent there can count on a miserable  stay.  Some would say that there was too much violence in the movie.  What  you have got to remember is Violence is a fact of life.  I would suspect  that violence like that was fairly common in that time.  If you want to do  a movie, you would want to depict it as true to life as you possibly can.All that aside, the movie is spectacular.  The movie is a little long,  but it is necessary to the story.  Remember, Andy was in prison for almost  20 years!  His planning to escape was continuing throghout that whole  time.In the opinion of this film critic it is a must see.	5.0	this movie should be in your top five favorites	1999-01-27	0	0	0

I liked this very much. My students, however, were mostly unable to concentrate on a movie like this.

A quiet man, wrongfully convicted of murder, a ""hardened criminal"".  Unlikely pairing for friends, in a place like Shawshank Prision, yet this is what the movie is ultimetly about.Tim Robbins plays the quiet banker, wrongfully imprisoned for killing his wife and lover.  He is brutilized his first few years in prison, but then little by little he earns the respect of fellow inmates and guards by showing them some of his hidden talents, particularly in finiance.Morgan Freeman is the natural choice for the hardened criminal who befriends Andy.  Morgan's character Red is a savvy businessman in his own way, and part of what keeps him alive and respected in prison.The movie is quite long, but you will be ingrossed in the movie and never realize it.  Every scene is well worth the time to watch.  The music more than fits the movie.  This Oscar nominated movie is defintly one to add to your collection.It's a bit unusual considering it's a Stephen King movie, yet it's my personal favorite of all movies based on Stephen King's writings.

That is definetely  a true statement!  To tell you the truth, The Shawshank Redemption really moved me.  It is a movie made to perfection (which more movies should be these days).  Since there are so many reviews on this site, I won't go into details about the story, but rather express my love for this wonderful movie.  Personally, I thing Morgan Freeman gives the best performance in this movie hands down!  Tim Robbins was great too, but something about Morgan's performance really makes you understand and feel for him deeply. Frank Darabont (in his directorial debut) did a stunning job directing this film. I guess that I could go on and on about this movie but is seems useless since there are so many reviews on this site.  But if anyone gets a chance to read this review (who hasn't seen the movie) please give it a chance! Hopefully you will feel the same way about it as I do.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3J5G9K06A54LE	"Michael Bloch ""chewblocha"""	"Back in 2000, my high school religion teacher had our class write a paper that we had to base on one of a few movies with religious themes. On his recommendation, I chose to watch ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" and since then, it has turned into my favorite movie of all time.I am not usually a big Tim Robbins fan, but he does a fantastic job playing Andy Dufresne, a banker who has to adjust to life in prison after being wrongfully convicted in the deaths of his wife and her lover. In my opinion, his portrayal of Andy is easily his greatest performance to date. The movie also features Morgan Freeman, who may be one of the greatest actors of his generation, as the felon named Red who is serving a life sentence and quickly becomes enamored with Andy and his easy-going, stoic lifestyle. Perhaps the best part of the movie is that they also manage to use Freeman as the narrator, and he has a deep, calming voice that I could listen to all day. He and James Earl Jones are in a tight race for best voice ever (although Kiefer Sutherland is catching up). The supporting characters are also expertly cast and well performed, as the viewer feels the perfect amount of affection or hatred for each of them.This classic story of (you guessed it) redemption will have you wishing for more time with Red and Andy, despite the fact that Shawshank is a fairly long film to begin with. It has some fantastic quotes (""I had to go to prison to be a crook"") some menacing villains (the warden) and some chilling scenes that are unforgettable. In the end, this is a movie about friendship and loyalty that I think all people should see and are sure to appreciate. It is no coincidence that of the over 700 people to have rated this movie so far, 99% of them have given it 5 stars. Go out and watch it now if you haven't done so already, because ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."""	5.0	Welcome to Shawshank	2006-02-24	2	2	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	It seems supremely ironic that two of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work have taken place in prisons:  THE GREEN MILE and this mesmerizing drama, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  With director/screenwriter Frank Darabont's careful execution, this movie offers us Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in some of their most outstanding film work.  Years later, both actors would win supporting actor Oscars, which can only be inclusive of their work in this film as well.  As far as its length goes, I think Darabont wanted us to experience the time factor of being locked up in a prison, where hope is certainly not on the menu for these doomed gentlemen.  As the movie unfolds, we are treated to some fine characterizations and superb, understated performances.  In addition to the brilliant work from Robbins and Freeman, savor the other performers:  Bob Gunton as Warden Norton, a Bible spouting hypocrite who uses Robbins to become a wealthy man; James Whitmore as Brooks, who after fifty years of incarceration is set free and cannot face life in the outside world; William Sadler as the loud-mouthed but affable prisoner; Clancy Brown as the brutal and vindictive guard; Gil Bellows in his brief but powerful turn as Tommy, whose fate only vilifies the corrupt warden even more.  With a marvelous score by Thomas Newman and the brilliant cinematography of Roger Deakins, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a powerful examination of the power of hope, and a dazzling cinematic experience.	5.0	FROM RITA TO RAQUEL	2005-04-24	2	1	1

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2ZLROGIL2V7GV	Michael Crane	This is a classic movie that should be seen by everybody.  Based on the story by Stephen King, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is a powerful movie filled with talented actors, a brilliant story, and more.Morgan Freeman, who plays &quot;Red&quot;, narrates the story.  He has been in Shawshank prison for many years for murder.  It starts out like everyday.  Him and the other prisoners would run as soon as they hear the bus bringing in the &quot;new meat&quot;, and make bets on who is going to crack first.  Red bets on Andy, who is played by Tim Robins.  As it turns out, Andy went through the first night without saying a word to anybody.Andy has been confined to Shawshank for being convicted of murder.  Although he maintains his innocence, it seems that nobody believes him, and for that he must serve hard time in the unforgiving prison which is filled with violent guards who are just waiting for an excuse to brutally beat prisoners to death, and a crooked warden who holds the Bible close to him.  Soon, Andy and Red become friends, as Andy does his best to never let his hopes of freedom die.  However, he sure learns that most of the people that enter Shawshank never come out human, and do not know how to handle freedom.  Still, Andy knows in his heart that he will be free someday.This is a terrific film which gives the true meaning of friendship, and what one must go through in order to find the final redemption.  I would've liked it if there were more extras on the DVD, but other than that this is a must-have.  This film is brillantly directed, and the screenplay is outstanding.  Filled with heart and surprises, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is an outstanding picture.	5.0	Terrific and Touching	2001-09-10	6	6	0

If there was to be a movie to break this 'mold', the Shawshank Redemption is it.  Tim  Robbins animates Andy Dufrense almost exactly as I recall him from King's  story, and Morgan Freeman is as powerful as ever as Red.  The acting and  directing surpassed the writing.

A man in prison for a crime he did not commit.  Another related theme is the person out of place, a character in a environment , at least on the surface, he is poorly equipped for.  Andy learns to adapt, in fits and starts, to prison life and is willing to take the long view of things.  Unexpected strengths are revealed slowly.  There are excellent characters sprinkled throughout.  This is a fine movie, one that has grown on me after several viewings.

This movie is so gripping, so aweome, and it's great. A monumental achievement for Frank Darabont.This movie takes place in the 40's where Andy(Tim Robbins) is charged with the deaths of his wife and the man who was having an affair with her. He gets two life sentences for the crime. He meets up with Red(Morgan Freeman) in prison and the two form a friendship that teaches Red about life and hope. Red is the guy who can get things for people and Andy ask for something a little unusual Rita Haworth. The reason is not clear until later in the movie. Red delivers with a poster of her. The movie reaches its highpoint near the end and I wouldn't want to ruin it for anyone that hasn't seen this movie. The ending is awesome. Both actors here deliver their best performances and the director/writer Frank Darabont does an excellent job of adapting the story to screen. (He's a big Steven King fan by the way). This is a must have for anybody. It's main themes are faith, hope, and the human spirit. It's just awesome!Watch it twice, three times, it gets better each time you watch it.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A24OIZI3EKR1O3	Michael Pep	The Shawshank Redemption is easily one of the 5 best movies I have ever seen, and I consider myself a movie junkie. The relationship between Robbins and Freeman seems absolutely real. The story teaches us that  anything can be achieved by keeping hope alive. There are a couple of  memorable lines that will stay with you for a lifetime. No offense to Tom  Hanks who won Best Oscar the year this movie came out for &quot;Forrest  Gump&quot; but Freeman's performance in this movie should have garnered him  the Best Oscar. I also recommend the short story &quot;Rita Hayworth and  the Shawshank Redemption&quot; by Stephen King from his collection  &quot;Four Seasons&quot; as required reading.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3QQX1AX8NL3KS	Michael Spertus	My wife and I were recently surfing through TV channels and we happened on  a broadcast of the Shawshank Redemption, which we had watched on video a  while earlier. We both turned to each other and said &quot;Look, it's the  Shawshank Redemption! That was such a good movie!&quot; We then continued  to watch it all our favorite scenes and couldn't believe how good they  were.I like to think of the Shawshank Redemption as just a really well  done movie that is not a &quot;great&quot; movie. What I mean by this is  that it is not all that ambitious of a movie, in contrast to movies like  the Godfather or Taxi Driver, which attempt to redefine the idiom. Instead,  it is just an incredibly well-made movie without a lot of pretensions.It has all the ingredients for a formula prison movie: The naive spoiled  protagonist totally unprepared for jail, the wise and savvy lifer who helps  him out, the sadistic corrupt warden, etc. However, the characters are so  well drawn and acted that they never once seem formulaic. I think the  characters are even more impressive for this, because they overcome ones  tendency to view them as stereotypes even though they superficially fit  into stereotypes.It is hard to say enough good things about the acting.  I'll just stop at saying that every actor I was familiar with gave the best  performance that I have seen in their career.The bottom line is that The  Shawshank Redemption is simply a really good movie, nothing more and  nothing less.	5.0	The best movie that is not a &quot;great&quot; movie	2000-09-04	3	3	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ARABS9ZLJ7OHF	Mike Blinn	I won't spoil the movie, but I will say that Shawshank has the best ending of any movie I've ever seen. I agree with the reviewer who said he'd kill to see it for the first time again, but I've seem this flick 20-30 times  and I still want to stand up and cheer everytime I see the climax. I also  give the movie kudos for its discretion. It certainly earns its R rating  (it is a prison movie, after all), but it only includes enough graphic  content to get the point across.  Finally, I agree that the acting is  terrific and the movie takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride from  start to finish. All in all, one of my favorites.	5.0	Very Satisfying Movie	2000-03-03	0	0	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2K53J3MLTXFB3	miramaxfan	The Movie:Every so often in everyone's life, they walk out of a movie that they consider perfect. A movie where you don't sit through it and think to yourself how you might have done it all differently had you been  the director. I have a couple of movies like that, and &quot;The Shawshank  Redemption&quot; is one of them. I still remember clearly walking out of  the theater in 1994 and thinking that I've just seen one of the best movies  that I'll ever have the pleasure of sitting through. A movie so elegant and  emotional that is perfect in its way of storytelling. A movie that is about  how hope can never die. The movie earned several Academy Award nominations  that were certainly well-deserved, but it left theaters all too quickly.  Over the years though, it has gained a strong cult following.The movie  stars Tim Robbins in one of his very best performances as Andrew Dufresne,  a quiet man who is convicted of the murder of his wife and is sent to  Shawshank prison. It's there he meets &quot;Red&quot;, a convict played by  Morgan Freeman who gets things from the outside for a price. He first sees  Andy as he's lead into the prison and predicts that he won't last long  inside the prison walls. Over time though, he's suprised that the young man  is able to survive and soon, the two become friends with respect for each  other. Andy is not a man who &quot;fights the system&quot;. He spends his  days in his own quiet world, a courage that the other prisoners don't quite  understand at first. Robbins has built this character in a way that we  the performance is not showy, but subtle. The result is that we want to  know more and when we do begin to understand his ways, that only makes us  want him to succeed that much more. I won't go into much more in the way of  detail about the movie; if you haven't seen it, I don't want to ruin any of  the enjoyment of the movie; if you have, I'm sure you already have your  feelings about the movie. This is a movie that's not depressing; it has a  lot of life to it and I think that when they look back at the 90's, they  will see that this is one of the best pictures that was released during  this time.Yes, Warner Brothers has proven to made an error in judgement  about their way of going about putting this DVD out. There was an  announcement over a year ago, I believe; then previous announcements came  later after the first delay promising a director's commentary, then a  Morgan Freeman commentary, then, in the final moments before the DVD is  released this week...nothing. It's a shame, as &quot;Shawshank&quot; is a  film deserving of much more. I suppose part of me is happy with the fact  that this film is finally on DVD, although if this is the final product,  there is no reason in my mind that this couldn't have been released a long,  is an excellent looking image. One of the best cinematographers in the  business (Roger Deakins- &quot;Fargo&quot;) did the filming on this picture  and the pale colors are represented well throughout the picture, mainly  browns and greys. Like the movie, there is an elegance to the visual style  on this picture that is apparent in every movie that Deakins has worked on.  Images are clear and crisp throughout; sharp, but not overly sharp for a  &quot;smooth&quot; feeling that looks very film-like.There are few  problems, and none of them are terribly distracting at all. There is a  slight shimmering in a scene or two and some very small instances of grain.  Other than that, this is an excellent looking image that will certainly  beautiful sound mix. It's also a newly remastered 5.1 mix. It's not flashy  or showy, nor does it need to be. It does however, do what it needs to do  best very well. The score by Thomas Newman is absolutely wonderful and it  sounds clear and crisp throughout the picture. Surrounds are put into use  occasionally, but always in a subtle way that is right for the picture.  What I was pleased about most though, was how rich and clean the score  sounded on this DVD. Dialogue is clear and without problems as well. Again,  Non-animated main menus that have the score playing in the  dissapointment of this DVD; all that's included is the trailer and some  production  stills.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Final  Thoughts Although it's unfortunate that this isn't the special edition that  it should have been it is a must for any collection. I'm happy  the film is finally being realized by more and more people as a classic  piece of filmmaking, which I've always considered it to be.	5.0	Although not a special edition, still a fine DVD	1999-12-22	334	304	30

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A27RJ30RN5K9MX	Mitch Weaver	Andy Dufresne ( Tim Robbins) is a well educated banker that is wrongly convicted of killing his wife. Sent to Shawshank Prison to serve a life sentence, Andy starts out having a hard time and existing only in appearance. That is until he meets Red ( Morgan Freeman)- the man in Shawshank that can get you anything. Andy and Red soon become the best of friends. Andy's demeanour and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look within himself, and the world around him, while Andy proves to all the inmates at Shawshank that hope and determination can get you through even the cruelest of circumstances.Everything about this film, from the directing to the musical score, is absolutely flawless. Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's novella &quot; Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption&quot; is absolutely incredible. The adaption is so good, that the film manages to be even better, because the story is too rich to be limited to a 100 page short story, and the film puts it on much grander scale. Darabont really shows how much emotion a musical score can get from the audience. It is one of the best I have ever heard, and it really drives the film. The story itself deals with the concepts of hope and freedom. They are the concepts of humanity which everyone wants, and it gives the film a more personal feel. These concepts are so intricately drawn into the plot, that the audience can't help being drawn in to the film.The actors are do a phenomenal job. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give the performances of their careers. The warden played by Bob Gunton is outstanding because of how well he plays both sides of his character. He claims to be highly religious, but shows his truly dispicable nature at the same time. Great two face character! James Whitmore does a great job with Brooks Hatlen. &quot;Brooks is an institutional man now&quot;. His performance acturately portrays how a person can come to depend on the environment around them. Other great performances are given by William Sadler as Haywood, Clancy Brown as Captain Byron Hadley, and Gil Bellows as Tommy Williams.&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; has it all - a great script with an identical adaptation, outstanding direction, amazing performances, thought provoking concepts of the human condition, and a briliant musical score. In 148 minutes running, the film manages to become a masterpiece that is one of a kind. Truly unforgettable film!	5.0	Absolutely outstanding film!!!	2003-09-03	7	5	2

It's easily the best movie of the '90s, and qualifies as one of the best ever.  This movie has a luster, a shimmering quality that has yet to dim, even after all the times I have watched it.""Redemption"" is a stark look at prison life.  From the brutal discipline of the guards, and the crushing lonliness that each and every prisoner feels.  Andy (A stirring Tim Robbins) is wrongfully convicted of his wifes' and her lover's murder, and is sentenced to life in a prison at Shawshank prison.  There, he befreinds Red (Morgan Freeman at the utmost of his abilities), a black inmate who was convicted of murder back in the '20s, and is one of the few men in Shawshank who will admit he is guilty.  For the first few years, Andy is only stays quiet staying out of the reach of the prisons' homosexual gang, who have their eye on him.  After that threat passes, he comes into his own at the prison.  He revitalizes the prison library, keeps financial records for the warden, and ends up doing the taxes for all the guards in Shawshank.  Later on, he struggles to find the truth to the murder he is convicted of, in light of new evidence brought forth from a new inmate.Andy's story is not the only compelling one in Shawshank.  Morgan Freeman brings a vulnerability and a maturity to his character that  gives it depth and dimension that makes it seem that Red's soul is borne before you eyes, and you know him as if he were yourself.  And the voiceovers that he gives never come off as unnecessary filler.  Instead, they serve to give even more perspective to the movies' themes of freedom lost, despair, helplessness and triumph.I really wish I could say more, but that would make this review seem drawn out and repetitive, and spoil the movie.  All you need to know is the ""Shawshank Redemption"" is on a higher plane.  Rarely does a movie like this, a simple story with epic undertones but never loses  sight of its true essence, ever come along.  I give this movie my highest recommendation, though it definitly deserves even more."	5.0	Powerful, Emotional, Unforgettable	2003-02-11	2	2	0

This movie is amazing and the story of two men who meet up in an unlikely place in an unlikely way makes me feel hopeful that such moments will happen for me. Andy and Red are the most mesmerizing pair of friends that anybody would want to see. Andy has the faith and hope of young children with dreams of becoming presidents and kings/queens. Red has wisdom and just enough hope in his friend Andy to barrel through any obstacles.The loss of innocence and freedom are common themes found throughout movies, literature, and life. Shawshank brings these major themes into focus allowing the audience to hope and dream with the characters. Even the supporting characters carry a magical life of their own. This has to be one of the best book-based Stephen King movies made.If you like good movies you'll love this movie.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AMAJRUBTFSQR5	Momoko	Knowing that 750 reviews were written for this film as of today, I still have to write this because I watched this film so many times while I was learning how to speak English, coming from another country when I was old enough to face difficuties learning another language. I turned the caption on, rewinded, played, repeated the words aloud, and then watched the same thing again to the extent that I still remember many of scripts.The Shawshank Redemption was not the only movie I used for language practice, but I had chosen it because I simply loved it! The more I watched it, the more I understood the story. No matter how careful I was watching, anytime I watched it I always noticed some detail that I didn't notice the previous time I watched it. That is because the movie is carefully made in detail so that this movie can tolerate being watched over and over again.In 1998, I got to the point where I know who says what at what timing, so I stopped watching it. In other words the movie now exists within me that I don't need to see it. I really digested it, and the Shawshank Redemption became a part of me. It took years for me to find some of the jokes in the film funny as I became familiar with American culture and its language (especially slangs).Acting is worderful. Music is wonderful. Photography is wonderful. It's just a wonderful movie!	5.0	I Digested This Film by Watching It So Many Times	2005-04-16	5	5	0

Everything in this film works. The acting and writing is out of this world. I still don't care for Tim Robbins as an actor, but he didn't get on my nerves too bad mainly because this movie is just that good. This is in my top 3 favorite films ever and it has been that way since the first time I saw it over a decade ago. If you haven't seen it yet or even if you have, you must own it.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1FULNZXYM28IA	"""mooshoo2000"""	Often after watching a movie I can immediately review it, finding it easy to pick out scenes on the spot, and remember the better or worse points in the movie, while still fresh. I have not dared to try and summarize my thoughts about &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; until days after seeing it, as there is so much to process, to take in. The minute this movie begins you are thrown into the world that our characters live in, and you do not emerge out from it until the final scene has played out. The acting, direction, scenery, script, cinematography, music...everything is flawlessly connected and interweaved into what can only be described as a masterpiece.Tim Robbins is stunning as the heart-breakingly mild mannered man who is sent to prison, charged with murdering his wife and her lover. I could spend 10 reviews worth raving about Tim Robbins's performance in this film, and it is well deserved. Had anyone else been cast in the role played by Tim Robbins, this otherwise flawless movie would have fallen apart. The perfect look, charisma and acting skill put into this by Robbins makes this entire movie worth while, in itself.It would be unfair of me to explain the plot any further, as this movie is best seen when fresh, and when the viewer is unaware of the turn out, or various surprises that occur throughout the plot. Although not a horror flick, or scary movie...this is perhaps one of the most chilling movies I have ever come across.Visually and emotionally stunning, this movie is right on target.	5.0	Whoa	2002-05-12	4	3	1

But this one is well worth the nearly 3 hours it takes to watch it.Sometimes the acting is too &quot;staged&quot; and the dialogue too &quot;scripted&quot; but nontheless a great experience.Even though it is supposed to have a happy ending it left me feeling sad.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R	Movie Fan	I've been asked if this film is a true story because many people thought it was when it camer out. It's so beautifully written that it does seem like a true story, and i wish it was, but it's not i think. It's too perfect. And that old prison where they filmed this, is allegedly haunted, and the show ghosthunters went there to investiagte paranormal acitivy, and they had the props on display like the hole where andy crawled out, and the room where brooks committed suicide in. And the place actually turned out to have some activity. But back to the film. What i like most about this movie is it captures both sides of prison life, both the bad and good. I guess most people have this notion that prison is all about violence, rape, and assualting day and night. But there is also another side, which is loyalty, friendship, and believe it or not some good times, especially for lifers who come to get use to the place and make friends. The saddest part, well there are two, but it was extremely sad to me when they released brooks. You really understood why he felt the way that he did. No family, no friends, not much understanding of life on the outside in such times, because he was in prison for 50 years. And times change. Not only that, just imagine having to leave your friends, and the life you knew, and being a senior citizen. To me, that was so depressing, especially after he freed his bird who he took care of since it was a baby. I'm sure he felt very homesick to say the least after he was released because that was his home, his life for 50 years. It's like now what? A crap job, and live in some halfway house till the day he died, lonely, and afraid, and sad. That part has always been a tearjerker for me. And the second saddest part, is when the evil warden, had that kid shot because he had information that could free andy. That made me sick, and he had the nerve to talk about God and the bible, and what's right and wrong, and then he has a witness murdered in cold blood. Sadistic, hypocrit SOB. The acting is outstanding, especially tim robbins and morgan freeman. They had that chemistry you dont see too often in films. I can't say enough about this film, and the ending is the best ending to any movie in film history, when andy escapes, and has the information to take the wardens laundered money, and get him busted by the fbi at the same time. Vengence is always sweet. So once again, this is the best prison movie ever made.	5.0	The BEST prison movie ever made!	2005-10-28	1	1	0

This is a great human drama.  The film takes place at Shawshank State Prison.  The two main characters are Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) and Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins).  Andy's wife was murdered and he gets convicted of the crime but he cannot remember that night.  It is a high profile case and his conviction makes him a celebrity prisoner (which is not good.)Red takes Andy under his aged wing and shows him the ropes.  They become fast friends. But Red cannot protect Andy and he becomes fresh meat for the prisoners to abuse.  This continues until one day Andy does a favor for a guard and gets his crew a treat.  This endears him to the men.Andy gets assigned to the library.  Then the guards start to see Andy for financial advice, earning him more favors.  When the librarian Brooks (James Whitmore) is paroled, we follow his attempt to adjust to outside life.Andy wants to build a proper library for the prison and after a concert effort the Brook Hatlen Memorial Library is opened.  The warden is impressed by Andy's ingenuity and asks him to help him launder his kickbacks.  This causes a problem when a new inmate tells Andy about his old cellmate that killed a banker's wife and her lover.  The warden cannot let Andy go free.This is a great film about man's humanity under oppression.  Frank Darabont has crafted a masterpiece.  Morgan Freeman received his third Oscar nomination for this film and should have won.  James Whitmore once again shows what a great supporting performance is.  Once again he gets ignored at awards time for more critically favored actors in less demanding roles.  Tim Robbins has the lead role but his character is the one that everything hangs from.DVD EXTRAS: None"	5.0	Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins go to Jail	2006-01-25	6	6	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2ZVERVFM25MJT	"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283"""	Frank Darabont's classic prison yarn based on a Stephen King novella (that is well worth reading) has only gained its fame retrospectively.  Failing at the box office it has since become a classic among modern movies.  The story has wealthy banker Andy (Robbins) jailed in Shawshank for the murder of his wife and her lover.  Whilst there he makes friends with Red (Freeman), the 'man who can get things'.This is one of those rare films where the story isn't really at the forefront of the picture.  Rather Darabont takes his time to introduce us to his characters and build up a realistic and touching friendship between the two Shawshank lifers.  This is a movie that tackles with such tricky themes as hope, friendship and freedom of spirit and pulls them all off in spectacular style.  Never resorting to schmaltz or unnecessary violence this hits you in all the right places without ever putting a foot out of place.  In fact, for a prison film this is surprisingly tender, proving once and for all that this is a genre that can have a wide appeal when done right.'The Shawshank Redemption' also benefits from fleshing out the plot of the original novella (which is only just over 100 pages) by drawing out several characters into some genuinely moving storylines.  Of particular notice is a young Gil Bellows (who most will probably recognise as Billy from 'Ally McBeal'), as an aggressive youth who wants to get some qualifications.  There's also the story of the librarian .Of course, what holds the movie together most of all are the performances by the two male leads, who both give the performances of their respective careers.  Whilst never becoming mushy they both act out beautifully the depth of the friendship and the deep desire for freedom to perfection.  .This established Darabont as one of the most exciting new directors around and remains one of the best movies of its genre ever made.  Almost universally liked, 'The Shawshank Redemption' will not disappoint.	5.0	An undisputed classic	2002-10-23	4	3	1
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW	Mr. Cairene	I can't review this film, I lose all elequence when talking about a film I love this much. I will say that Morgan Freeman's voice over is the best voice over in history. Among my favourite passages in this singular  masterpiece is the sequence of Brooks trying to adjust to life on the  outside, looking for his bird in the park, its one of the most sublimely  moving sequences in film history, and underlies the films central theme ,  which is voiced in a great scene by Freeman &quot;These Walls are funny,  first you hate them, enough times passes, you come to depend on  them.&quot;Meaning in life, people liiving in terrible conditions for a  long enough period of time might actually go back to them voluntarily if  they don't do something about it soon enough.(I did mention that I lose all  elequence, so no apologies). A lesson that is delivered by Andy in a payoff  so beautiful that I would kill to see it again for the first time, yet  strangely enough never loses its impact on repeated viewings. Right now ,  I'm in the process of hunting down people who haven't seen it, so I can  show it to them and see it again through their eyes.Unquestionably the  greatest film of nineties(much better than its oscar compition Forest Gump  and even Pulp Fiction), it, along with Midnight Run,The Thin Red Line and  Goodfellas , is my all-time favourite movie. See it now. Then see it again.	5.0	One the best EVER MADE	2000-02-19	5	5	0

It seems that most of us who have been lucky enough to watch this gem have been profoundly moved by this story. Not hearing anything about the release of this film in '96, I rented this out without any idea what to expect, other than it was a prison drama. Now I love prison flicks and my favourites are Brubaker, Birdman of Alcatrez and Stir Crazy, but after watching Shawshank Redemption I can say this is one of the best films ever made, and one of the very few movies that made me cry, and it takes a lot for me to shed a tear. I think the last time I cried was at my grandpas funeral, but that was a different emotion to the one I felt watching the Shawshank Redemption. The ending was filled with a great deal of satisfaction and hope that you rarely get in any film today.

Though based on a different time of life, it's strong themes can be seen and applied to our lives.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman both perform in some of the greatest roles ever, and the duo create a chemistry that displays true friendship and trust.  Through their bond, issues other than those dealing directly with the penitentiary are addressed and made evident to the viewer an honest approach to life.  To sit through the movie is quite enjoyable, and never does it get slow at all.  In my humble opinion, as a college student and having first seen it in high school, it has only gotten better with time and it has indeed helped to shape my perception of the world.	5.0	Great movie with a strong theme	2001-01-02	0	0	0

We almost passed up seeing it as the name just sounded boring. I'm so glad we took a  chance because this is one of the greatest movies ever made! So much more than a prison film, this movie is an inspirational triumph of the human soul.A movie that can be watched over and over again with a great cast and story. It will keep you engrossed from beginning to end. A story about friendship, endurance, compassion and most of all hope!

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1YHKSTVSYEYTU	Mr. N. Carnegie	"What can you say about The Shawshank Redemption that hasn't already been said? It must be one of the best loved and indeed greatest films ever made. I do not know anybody that has seen this film that doesn't LOVE it. It really is that superb.Adapted from Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, it tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), an outwardly timid man convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and jailed for life. Arriving at Shawshank prison in 1947, Andy becomes the victim of prison brutality in the early part of his stay but he also befriends another lifer, the prison ""fixer""  named Red (beautifully played by Morgan Freeman) and his buddies. Through his knowledge of taxation and financial transactions he also becomes popular with the prison warden and the guard that runs his brutal regime but Andy also soon realises that in prison life means life and that's what they try to take from him.This is the most beautiful and ultimately uplifting film you could ever hope to see, whilst recognising the traditional conventions of prison drama (such as brutality and rape), it is really a film that demonstrates that the human spirit can overcome brutality with faith, friendship (and a rock hammer). This is as close to the perfect film as you will ever get. It is perfectly cast from the leads Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, who give wonderfully understated performances to the supporting cast of Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Bob Gunton and Gil Bellows. It is subtly directed by Frank Darabont who carefully manages to avoid overstatement and oversugaring the cake with sentiment and pathos.The most amazing thing about this film is that although it was nominated for seven academy awards in 1994 it didn't win any (they were dominated by Forrest Gump) and it is described in Leonard Matlin's film guide as ""terribly overlong"", ""hollow and predictable"". How wrong could you be? The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless all-time classic that will cast its spell over many people for a long long time to come.Five stars are often too easily awarded by movie reviewers but this deserves six."	5.0	TIMELESS CLASSIC	2002-01-08	3	1	2
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2B79TA7RW397U	"Mr. Nc Shackley ""NatShack"""	A heart-warming prison drama set in the late 40's (but is in the 60's by the time it finishes), The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of a bank accountant sent to the Shawshank prison convicted of murdering his wife, wherein he meets Ellis Redding, a long time prison server whom he evetually strikes up a close friendship with. The film also briefly follows the experiences of other prisoners, representing the unfair treatment some recieve whilst in prison, cleverly allowing the film to expand on other issues apart from friendship.Although the film unfolds at a slow pace, we are justly rewarded for our patience near the end when the film throws up one of the greatest twists in film history (don't worry I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it!) which makes the film worth watching for this part alone.The Shawshank Redemption is successful (like so many other films and stories) because it focuses so well on the theme of friendship. When watching the film you long for yourself to have a friendship as strong and trusting as Andy and Ellis' to the point where one could say that you yourself would like to be in that prison (but do not be mistaken to think that the whole film glamourises prison, it can sometimes quite the opposite as some of the brtual and shocking scenes show).However, and contrary to what many people say, the Shawshank Redemption is not an all-out masterpiece. It lacks that extra something, that extra bite that deprives it from being a complete masterpiece (but don't get me wrong, it's still head and shoulders above most of the nonsence released on the screens nowadays) but is an excellent film nonetheless.	4.0	One of the 90's best	2002-04-24	0	0	0

You cannot explain to someone who hasn't seen the film just HOW good it really is, it is indescribable!. I bet those who have seen it and love it as much as i do cannot name a better film, it is THAT good.This film is a truely classic film, and a case of a film being released in a lowish profile, in the shadow of Evita (can you believe it!) and gaining a snowboard effect in the fact that everyone recommended it to their friends and so on!. Even today it is still on the best sellers lists and has been voted in the top three films of ALL time many times. For me i have yet to see a better film and i doubt i EVER will.Tim Robbins is so good in the role of Andy, and as for Morgan Freeman, you could not have picked a better actor to play that role.Those of us that LOVE this film dearly should also love &quot;The Green Mile&quot;. It is the same Writer/Director combo, and while not as good a film as Shawshank, is still a classic in its own right.I will sign off now saying how unjust the film industry was  to NOT award any Oscars to this film, in my oppinion it should have swept the board in all categories and Evita should have had NOTHING!!	5.0	Surely the best movie of ALL time?	2003-01-25	2	1	1

You will never grow bored of this movie, and you will never forget it.I think, this week, my favorite line takes place when Andy Dufresne's cell is ""tossed"" and the warden nearly forgets to return Andy's Bible. SALVATION LIES WITHIN. Indeed it does.An aside...I had the privilege to tour the defunct Ohio prison where the movie was made. It's so HAUNTED by real souls who resided there, and seeing it just gave me the shivers.

"I have watched many great movies in my time(and a good deal more bad ones) but not even the greatest of them celebrates the human spirit in such a simple and powerful way as Shawshank Redemption does. And it is also based one the novella (which can be found in different seasons) by one of the all-time great authors Stephen King.  It tells the story of a man named Andy Dufresne who is sent to prison for the murder of his wife, (which at that time you are not sure if he did it or not)  When he first arrives at Shawshank Prison, he meets a man named ""Red"" Redding who can ""locate certain things from time to time"" They hit it off, and over time become close friends. Over time, different amusing and sad things happen, and you learn just how deep Andy's reservoir of willpower and courage is. (Not to mention extremely smart). Perhaps its best to let the viewer find out about everything that goes on in the film, but in the end, the movies message-fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free--is so simply brilliant that it somehow put s it one up over every other movie out there.  It didn't do too well in theatres, but it did pretty good with dvd sales and such.

It is flawlessly cast, scripted, and  photographed. Even after six viewings this bittersweet story about  injustice, cruelty, and friendship still retains it's meaning.Tim  Robbins and Morgan Freeman deserved Academy Awards for their portrayls of  convicts struggling to survive and maintain a sense of hope and  dignity.The added bonuses on this DVD version is well worth the price.	5.0	Simply the Best	2000-08-10	4	3	1

Andy had become a too valuable asset.  But Andy keeps his hope alive by working out a long range plan.  He invites his good friend 'Red' to come find him in Zihuatanejo if and when he gets out.  However 'Red' thinks he's too institutionalized to make it on the outside.  Against all odds we find ourselves pulling for Andy and &#34;Right&#34; to win out.	5.0	He's Innocent!

It's about the ability to retain hope, and the way life puts it before us to choose hope - or not.  &#34;Get busy livin', or get busy dyin',&#34; as Morgan Freeman says in the film.  I love that.

With narration by one of my favourite actors, MORGAN FREEMAN, and a performance by him that should have won him an OSCAR - partnered with TIM ROBBINS'S magnificent portrayal of a man wrongly convicted - is what makes this work. Not to mention, incredible characters we meet along the way. Attention to detail with costumes, sets and props. Spectacular footage rounds it all off. The prison itself is a character and it actaully comes alive in the film... the doom and gloom of the prison as we fly over it for the first time... makes you feel very uneasy. And as Andy walks through the entrance and stares up - the building almost seems to be staring down at him.All in all a grity, no holes barred look at prison life (along with the unpleasant truth of prison gang rape), a journey for RED & ANDY that will see them respecting each other and becoming good friends, and a lesson that teaches us : after all is said and done and we really believe we have nothing left...

It is one of those rare movies you will think about over and over again.  and again.  and again.The acting is just overly realistic.  The characters are vivid in a way that is unparalleled.  Each and every actor has just internalized their roles from the sisters, to the warden to the prisoners.  Their persona, their aura, their feel are drenched with verisimilitude.And the story line... a tale of a wrongfully imprisoned man who transcends all odds to escape.  It seems fantastic and unreal.  But as we follow him day by day, it makes sense.  We see that he was liberated the day he escaped from jail.  He was liberated from day one.  Inside, he was a free man the day he came to prison, and getting himself out was inevitable.Sure, most of us will not experience this Kafkaesque experience of wrongful incarceration.  But we've all been in situations where despondency, entrapment, and a Sisyphean work ethic are the norm.	5.0	get it!	2013-07-16	0	0	0

There are some that come close; even a few in its class. But for my money, I have never seen a movie that transcends the greatness of this one.If you want great performances, The Shawshank Redemption has them in spades: Tim Robbins, Moragan Freeman, and the always excellent Clancy Brown do some of their best work here. The rest of the supporting cast does likewise (especially that Miracle-Gro guy who plays Brooks).If you want screenwriting, you cannot top Darabont's script. He turns a somewhat over-long and dreary novella by Stephen King into a hymn to hope and a contemplation of the meaning of freedom. I especially love the joke about why Morgan Freeman's character is called Red (you need to have read the story to fully get it).If you want cinematography on a grand and sweeping scale, look no further. From the opening fly-over of the dreary prison grounds to the warm light of the field in buxton, to the final beauty of the pacific coastline--this movie has it all. Thomas Newman's score is the perfect complement to the action and the scenery.The story of Andy Dufresne as it is told in this movie is the story of an inner journey to freedom. It is one of a man blessed in a sense by the shattering of ""the everyday."" Ultimately, this is the allegory of all all our lives.""Get busy living, or get busy dying. God damn right.""I hope that you will give this film a chance...but don't leave what you find here on the screen.This movie gets close to the highest recommendation I could ever give.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2JHAY08NJ5V7O	"""nytnd83"""	The Shawshank Redemption ranks among the top five movies I've ever seen.  Who knew such a heartfelt and poignant story could come from Stephen King?  I was throughly impressed with the storyline, which follows like a mirror  when compared to the written work (which I also recommend).  If you don't  know of the story, Tim Robbins plays a banker who is falsely accused of  murdering of his wife.  No, the one armed man didn't do it, but he surely  didn't.  He has no proof, is convicted and sent to Shawshank Prison, where  he eventually befriends a kind-hearted ex-con played by Morgan Freeman (who  more than deserved his Academy Award-nominated performance).  I won't give  anything more not only because everyone else probably has explained the  story in full, but I will say this: This movie has such a great finale.  It  gives you so much hope for the future and that all that is good eventually  works out for the best.  Skip The Green Mile because compared to this  similar prison movie, it blows.	5.0	Absolutely superb	2000-06-22	5	3	2

But to my mind, the Shawshank Redemption never rises above simply ""satisfactory"".With Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman at the helm, it was always going to be a worthy sort of picture. Alas, it scores worthiness points in that numb-skulled Hollywood way, by painting the moral world in black and white. The characters are either completely virtuous, or they're thoroughly nasty. That makes the moral lesson easy to preach, but also completely undermines it, because we know the real world just isn't like that. Well, mine isn't, anyway.To wit: the prison gang into which wrongly convicted (of course - but how much better would the picture have been had he actually done it?) Andy Du Fresne falls - lifers, all - comprises only genuinely nice, decent, hard working, obedient folk.Freeman's character, Red, is an avuncular figure not a million miles from B. B. King, but who is continually, inexplicably, rejected for parole by the nasty white folk. He accepts his lot without complaint (but when he finally does speak his mind, he gets released!) Old timer Brooks (equally avuncular, but this time not a million miles from namesake Mel) is eventually paroled, but he doesn't want to leave his home of 50 years, and when pushed out in to the cruel modern world ... well, I don't want to give anything away. But it isn't hard to guess.The remainder of the moral lessons are the standard Hollywood fare; it's a film that attempts the epic sweep of The Dead Poets' Society, without the lyricism (but, to its credit, also without Robin Williams) and attempts to portray the brutal life of prison, without the brutality of say Sleepers.The hook line ""you get busy livin', or you get busy dyin'!"" is pure schmaltz, and I'm surprised Robbins didn't refuse point blank to deliver it. And if that wasn't bad enough, then Freeman reprises the line (only tacking on  ""that's goddamn right!"") as the credits roll. Ugh.And just for those who hadn't picked it up from watching the film (or reading its title), the director helpfully gushes ""it's all about redemption!"" in a fairly unenlightening accompanying documentary.The resolution of the film may be predictable, but the manner of its arrival is nicely engineered: well plotted, Stephen King.And as for ending up in Zihuatanejo - great call; it's a truly beautiful place - I once went there. It's just a pity the film crew didn't. Zihuatanejo is snuggled amongst some hills in a pretty little inlet, about a hundred miles west of Acapulco. Lord only knows, then, why they filmed the final shot on an outwardly curving ocean beach, which could be anywhere on the planet BUT Zihuatanejo..."	3.0	Never rises above the hollywood platitudes	2002-07-21	29	14	15

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2TOZDMQM1XM8I	Owain Wilson	At the risk of telling you what you already know, The Shawshank Redemption is the finest film of the last decade, and quite possibly one of the finest films ever made.  Seeing as we are all in agreement, I'll be brief.  Frank  Darabont's debut is a masterclass of storytelling.  Nary a single moment is  wasted in the telling of this beautiful story of friendship (Darabont is  good at friendship - see The Green Mile).  Every word, gesture and glance  is ultimately of the greatest importance to the unfolding story, leading to  a totally unforeseen resolution which left the audience I saw it with  gasping.  The friendship portrayed by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is  believable and deeply touching, yet somehow avoids the sentiment a lesser  filmmaker would have been unable to resist.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3JJLK9D1PXJ2N	paigemk113	The Shawshank Redemption is perhaps one of the most well thought out and intricate movies of its time. Released in 1994 The Shankshank Redemption stars Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins along side Ellis Boyd `Red' Redding played by Morgan Freeman.  When Andy is convicted of double homicide he is sent to live out his days under Wardon Norton in a small imaginary town in Maine. To say the least Andy makes the most of his life on the inside. . Andy with his sly smile and cleaver tactics weaves himself deep into the prisons web of secrets and lies, but the prison is not the only thing hiding secrets. The secrets that are held in books that Andy keeps for the warden are nothing compared to the secrets the lie behind the walls of Andy's very own cell. This movie is so good it is hard to describe in words. It is truly amazing how you pull for each and every character despite their questionable pasts. This movie will have you pulling for convicted felons in a way you never imaged you could. From beginning to end this story brings you back in time right inside those cinderblock walls. It brings you through the friendship, tragedy and ultimately the redemption of Andy Dufrane.	4.0	Shawshank	2012-12-03	2	2	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A9BI7NCNORRBS	Paige S. McParland	As one viewer put it, this is the best movie to never have received an Oscar that was ever made.  This isn't worth a second viewing, it's worth a 10th, 11th, and even 15th viewing.  I don't pretend to be a professional reviwer, but my opinion is that this is probably one of the best movies ever made.  Forget the Godfather, forget anything with Robert Redford or Paul Newman, forget any Woody Allen film ever made - the chemistry between Morgan Freeman as &#34;Red&#34; and Tim Robbins as &#34;Andy Dufresne&#34; is both unforgettable and unrepeatable in it's essence.  There are few 'extra's in this film - each man becomes that character (with Gil Bellows and James Whitmore especially memorable).  I can't say much more.  The Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie of all time - and it always will be.	5.0	Always the favorite.	2013-12-07	1	1	0

It has what is probably the greatest movie ending ever, and if you haven't heard anything about it yet, you will be taken completwly by surprise.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A7GFVAHL254RW	Paonia Dan	About as close to perfection as any movie I have ever viewed. The slow pace, as with Lonesome Dove, is vital to allow the friendship to grow and to give us a perspective on the time involved in this amazing story.I hope but am unsure if the 15 extra minutes of Morgan Freeman that I once saw (on Showtime or HBO) is included. It was mind boggling ... was bonus material where Morgan is managing freedom but losing hope. MUCH more than what is in the movie and so wonderfully acted! I saw it that one time long ago and have never even heard mention of that omitted long scene. I would POSITIVELY include that footage in any special release as fans such as myself would love it. It was all narative and struck deep into the soul of this man as he attempted to hold on.Looking forward to this set regardless ... what a film folks! Music, pace, acting, script, story and cinematography and so on ... can't say enough about this film.That Forrest Gump took all the honors and made the big money that same year while this classic was basically overlooked now looks as silly as it actually was. This movie goes deep and it's theme blossomed beautifully.	5.0	Perfect Film	2007-07-16	0	0	0

I'd seen it years ago when it came out in theaters, but today it is as fresh and gripping as ever. Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and Clancy Brown as the evil prison guard (trivia tidbit: Brown is the voice of Spongebob Squarepants' money-hungry boss, Mr. Crabs.) are all brilliant in their roles. We are rooting for Andy and Red (Robbins & Freeman) from the moment they establish their lifelong bond, and their ultimate redemption from a decades-long life in hell is one of the most satisfying experiences in film.  A brilliant screenplay masterfully brought to the screen -- see this movie. You will not be disappointed.	5.0	No better way to spend 2 hours & 20 min. than to watch this film	2013-03-29	0	0	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1YKL1L8AUNJRG	Patrick W. Dobslaw	"The Shawshank Redemption is my personal favorite movie, and I think you'll find that it's also the personal favorite of many a film lover.I wouldn't say there's an overriding reason for this, but in general I believe the main reason is because people generally choose a favorite movie or book because it relates to their lives in many ways. And I believe the story of The Shawshank Redemption is a story that many individuals can, in fact, relate to. It is for this reason, among other reasons of course, that the film has reached such a level of popularity with the movie-going public.Certainly, most of us (I hope) will not go to prison for a crime we did not convict and face an evil warden and prison guards before our eventual redemption. But what we do face, though, are many of own ""prisons"" and our own hardships, and I truly believe that those who love this movie see the main character (Andy Dufresne) as a representation of themselves -- and how they would like their life to eventually end up despite having ""impossible"" obstacles of their own to face. As The Shawshank Redemption says, to come ""out clean on the other side.""Many of America's greatest films did not get their proper acclaim at the time of their release, and only as time went by did the public elevate them to their legendary status. Such is the case with The Shawshank Redemption, and in the future, I expect you'll find that The Shawshank Redemption is widely accepted as one of the greatest films ever made.If you relate to the film's story and of Andy's experience in the movie, you'll almost certainly think the movie to be spectacular. Five stars. One of the best. If not, you'll probably find yourself thinking it to be a drawn-out prison movie. Three or four stars for a strong plot -- nothing spectacular. But, honestly, isn't that what's so great about movies? We all pick our favorites based on how they relate to our lives and our experiences. It just so happens that in the case of The Shawshank Redemption, the movie relates to a whole LOT of us."	5.0	One of the Best	2005-10-12	4	4	0

From the first creepy scene of the movie, to last scene on that sandy beach, I was totally immersed in the film.  Not only is the acting, location, and plot nearly perfect, but the movie also tells an uplifting story about a man who thrived in the darkest depths of Shawshank Prison.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2QFX8XTIOLDH4	Paul Taylor	You would think that a film about a prison break would be boring, straight foward and make a very drab film but this was made very well. It's a story of unity with certain inmates and how tough prison life is especially when you've been sent down for murder without even lifting a finger. Shawshank redemption is probably one of the more empathic films i have seen the acting is perfect throughout and there are quite a few twists that get you more and more intrigued as the film goes on. The film has a great ending aswell after Red had spent all those years in prison then says what he feels and gets accepted parole and is set free then meets up with Andy (maybe i should'nt have mentioned the ending) well it's obvious that they get free anyway. Andy gets beaten up many times in prison by a group of men called the sisters who feel they have to beat him up as he's different in the way he looks, acts, walks and everything at the prison. The main guys in charge are corrupt, facist and bent in almost every way imaginable which makes the ending even sweeter. So buy this if you want a widely acclaimed, lucid film that your almost bound to like.	5.0	Shawshank redemption is one of the great films.	2003-07-22	0	0	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3NFDFNZX300S4	"P. cunningham ""barney rubble"""	How does a Stephen King novel come to be one of the best films of recent time , if not one of the best five of all time . I have seen this film inumerable times and am still completely blown away by it each time I see it, I used to think it was the source novel that made it the film that it was though on numerous viewings I can now say that it is one of those rare occassions that the sum of the parts far excels the core components.Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne is one of those seminal acts of Hollywood casting that in years to come will be discovered to be probably fourth or fifth on the list behind the Hollywood big guns but which will be later be shown as the saving grace for the film ( much like a young carpenter named Harrison Ford in Star Wars) This is his moment and why he didn't win an Oscar for this role will be lamented in years to come.If you are looking for a film that inspires ,then this is for you but it goes so much further than just inspiring . To me it is a sign that when Hollywood wants to it can make a near three hour movie that has substance , the greatest acting seen in a complete cast for some time and a great story that hooks you in and makes you feel for the characters in a way that  harks back to the great times of Movie making and it shows up all the inadequacies that are evident in modern film making. It is no Die Hard third installment, no X-men , no no brainer but a deeply engaging movie that for once makes you care what happens to those people on the screen	5.0	Stephen King Novel = Excellent Movie?	2002-03-22	1	1	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2ODBHT4URXVXQ	"Peggy Vincent ""author and reader"""	This movie, adapted from a novella by Stephen King, crosses and defies the conventions of prison genre tales. Yes, there's violence, rioting, brutality, graft, dishonesty among officials, power politics - but it's really a story about faith in friendship and the raw skills of survival in an alien place.Tim Robbins plays the role of Andy, a banker who is sent to Shawshank Prison for murder. There he meets Red (Morgan Freeman in one of his very best roles), a lifer whose regular appeals for parole are just as regularly turned down. Andy, with his banking and organizational skills, becomes indespensible to the crooked warden, who is skimming money and taking payoffs. Then Andy escapes through a hole he's dug over the passage of several decades, a hole in his cell covered by a big poster of Raquel Welch - and in the process...well, I'll say no more, in case you haven't yet seen this superb film....

This story revolves around a group of men living behind the walls of Shawshank Prison.  Andy(Tim Robbins)  convicted of murdering his wife and Redd(Morgan Freeman) lead a small group  of prisioners in there daily routines.  A dishonest warden and a merciless  guard give them enough troubles just getting through the day.  Through work  details and private endevours, these men live for hope.  Only hope can get  them through Shawshank.  In the words of Andy and Redd, &quot;get busy  living, or get busy dying.&quot; A excellent film, masterfully told, but  with some adult themes and language children won't enjoy.	5.0	Shawshank Redemption	1999-12-02	1	1	0

The Shawshank Redemption has nothing at all whatsoever going for it, not even Deakins' cinematography could help save this pile of puke.It's fluff, it's that simple, so much fluff, in fact, that I think it would have even made Frank Capra sick.When the film was first released it was basically completely ignored, which Robbins loves to use as a point to compare the film to one of Orson Welles' masterpieces Citizen Kane which got the same treatment, but over the years it has gained a reputation, a new found respect, like the equally undeserving Ridley Scott abomination that is Blade Runner; it should have stayed ignored, plain and simple, let it wither away and rot.It's # 2 or 3 on the IMDb top 250, a list which in and of itself is a long, unbelievable joke; so, go figure, people are idiots who don't want to think too much when viewing a film; maybe that's why Haggis' Crash got best picture."	1.0	Inspirational movie making for the brain dead masses	2008-12-08	252	20	232

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2CMYX10636NG2	Portia	"Drawing slightly on the themes in Alexandre Dumas' THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO (which is even coyly referenced in the film by one of the criminals as ""Alexandre Dumb-A**""), THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is sure to renew your faith in modern filmmaking.The plot follows the life-long friendship formed in prision between Andy (played so wonderfully by Tim Robbins that I had to go out and watch his other films-- note: this is his best) and ""Red"" (portrayed perfectly by Morgan Freeman, as usual).Andy has been falsely accused of a crime he did not commit. He ends up serving a life sentance alongside Red, a sly criminal who can ""get you anything"", and the two develop a several-decade-long friendship. Andy was a smart banker before his arrest and helps the evil warden with his paperwork. Not to give away the plot or anything, but there is some definate LES MISERABLES influence in this movie as well. Not to say that it doesn't stand alone as an original work of wonderful writing and directing. The classic references only enhance the fulfilling story of friendship, faith, hope and perserverence.This is simply a perfect film and will leave you close to tears, if not actually shedding them. For a Hollywood film, it doesn't try to keep the plot ""on the safe side"", shedding dark, uncomfortable subjects for shallower ones. This movie will teach you something, and that's a big compliment."	5.0	great film about the power of faith and the human spirit	2003-08-18	3	2	1

This movie stars Morgan Freeman as 'Red' and Tim Robbins as 'Andy' an innocent banker, who meet up in prison from two very different worlds, to become lifelong best friends. Their performances were incredible and very poignant. 'Shawshank' is a wonderful story of how friendship prevails and stands the test of time, hardship and injustice, as others have mentioned.

This film contrasts them with the hypocrisy and brutality of those in authority and power over them. In some ways, it is a study of how easily and thoroughly power corrupts.It is also the story of how one man uses his brain to make a positive difference in his circumscribed world, and ultimately triumph over the hypocricy and corruption that keeps him in prison, even though proof of his innocence is discovered.

The plot is simple but with surprising twists, the characterisation is sensitive and believable, and the acting is outstanding.I like how the violence is neither glorified nor glossed over, neither graphically displayed nor hushed up. This gives a realistic, honest picture without excessive display of violence. I wish more films used this approach.The ending, alas, is saccharine and implausible and feels tacked on. If they had stopped the film earlier - say, when the postcard arrived - the viewer would have been left satisfied but thoughtful. Instead, they tacked on a sweet cheese ending. And, as if that wasn't enough, yet another sweet cheese. And another. These endings don't feel right; they lack the realism and authenticity and don't seem to be the same film. It was as if they couldn't leave a good thing as it was and were looking for yet more ways to make it cheesier.I recommend this film. It's worth watching. If you want it to be memorable, I suggest you stop when the postcard arrives. After that it goes downhill. I don't expect anyone will take my advice, though. :-)	4.0	Awesome film, let down by cheesy ending	2012-08-01	3	2	1

This movie definitely deserves all 5 of those stars. It tells the story of Andy Dufresne, an innocent man who is wrongly accused of the murder of his wife and another man and is sentenced to life in a maximum security prison. The movie details the friendships that developed in his time here and also some of the enemies that surfaced. Even if you don't enjoy this movie, I can assure one thing, this will be the best ending you have ever seen. The way the movie was set up to lead to this totally unpredictable ending was done masterfully.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A20IRKN3Q1A7F4	Renee	This is one of favorite movies, and for good reason.  It is one of those movies that you're not so sure about until you see the very end, then everything falls into place in your mind, and it is a great movie.  Outstanding performances by Robbins and Freeman help mold the movie into what it is.It isn't a typical prison movie, as someone said.  It isn't a prison that has a story to tell, it's a story being told about a prison and what it holds and is capable of, yet, the story revolves around two men, best friends, Robbins and Freeman.I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to sit and watch the lengthy, well-told story of two men, the prison that holds them, and the spectacular ending.	5.0	Shawshank Excellence	2002-06-18	2	2	0

Still, the two best, both about prisons and both written & directed by Frank Darabont have to be ""The Green Mile"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"". Both were also nominated for Best Picture and Screenplay, but NOT director (another Oscar travesty). ""Shawshank"" was a slight novella by King, and Darabont turned it into a 142 minute narrative that never fails to draw the viewer in deeper with every frame. The new 2-disc DVD is fine, though the 2nd disc has some repetitive interviews. How Darabont managed to take the grim story about a seemingly hopeless bunch of individuals and turn it into a film of hope, renewal and conscience...as well as a good smattering of justice...still amazes me. I am not the least bit surprised that this is considered among the best screenplays of all time. Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Bob Gunton, Gil Bellows and all the rest were perfect. The editing in particular was layered in a way where the very talky script never got tired. This is a film all should see, if only to know that if you have patience and keep your wits, anyone can survive the most dire circumstances. This is a wonderful film experience.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2IYUCI5A26O82	R. Hansen	This outstanding work is coterminous with films like `The Longest Yard' and `Cool Hand Luke' in that it touches upon our ambivalence about prison inmates. It is indicative of the dichotomous view that our society has in regard to the penal system when we can clarion lex talions among our fellow citizens yet identify with and cheer on movie criminals in theatres. Quite possibly it is the underlying threat of being immured ourselves, as we realize that it is really a fine line that keeps us free.Of course it takes more than a play on our hidden fears to produce a film this good. It takes a good script, solid acting and characters that we can give a damn about, all of which are gathered here brilliantly. Above all it takes a good story, and obviously Frank Darabont knew one when he adapted this Stephen King novella into a movie script (you never really can tell what you will end up with when you endeavor to bring one of King's books to the big screen). He also knows how to use a camera to draw us into the prison world and how to exploit the power of narration (assisted nicely by the warm voice and splendid diction of Freeman).SPOLIER ALERT!!! A truly great movie must have a truly great ending and this film actually has two. They could have ended it right after revealing the circumstances surrounding the escape as Freeman explains that he just misses his friend and it would have been fitting, but they continued and finish with a fabulous moment on the beach as Freeman succinctly explains in a voice over, `I hope'. For those of you who try to say that you could see the end coming a mile away---forget it; sell it to someone who's buying.	5.0	A tremendous story and a great film	2004-08-05	4	3	1

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2H9UO8RYFX5MB	"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich"""	"I've seen 'The Shawshank Redemption' at least a dozen times, and each time it resonates with me for different reasons.  Like the characters in the movie, it seems that this is a film that can grow and change and evolve with the viewer.The first time I saw it, I was one of the few who went to the theatre to see its initial run. The Stephen King novella it was based on, ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,"" was one of my all-time favorites (still is), and I wanted to see how well it was brought to the screen. Despite changes in the story and in some of the characters, I found that Frank Darabont stayed true to the heart of the story, and magnified what made the story such a wonder to read. Simply put, 'The Shawshank Redemption' was the best adaptation of a Stephen King story I had ever seen committed to film, and it remains so today.And beyond that, on its own merits, it is a fine film -- very nearly a perfect film. It stands the test of time, with themes that are universal, characters that come to life immediately, music that strikes a deep emotional chord, images that quicken the heart and move the soul, and words that are familiar, yet new. In other words, this story of men serving lifelong terms in prison, in all its simplicity and unpretentious presentation, becomes something that nearly anyone can identify with...and something that we can all gain a measure of hope from as well.The story opens with Andy Dufresne going to jail for killing his wife and her lover, a crime which he says he did not commit. It is a common premise, one which might (in other movies) lead to an investigation and a story of justice returned or vengeance wrought. And while we do find out the truth of Andy's story in due course, it is not the main thrust of the overall story arc. Andy's story is a part of the larger story at work here, a tale of routine and of struggle and of the possibilities and risks that come with a hope for something better.I've mentioned ""hope"" several times already, and no wonder, as the idea of hope is one of the central themes in 'The Shawshank Redemption.' The idea that, even in the darkest places of the world, there are things that can keep us from madness and despair, and those things are to be found within all of us, as long as we do not lose the will to look for it. If you're thinking like a movie about a Maine prison in the mid-20th century couldn't possibly convey this theme very well, think again.  Somehow, this premise ends up being an ideal vehicle for a story about friendship and hope.'The Shawshank Redemption' is no metaphor, and that's where it gets its strength. The prison it is named for is treated as the hardest of stone-cold realities, and the characters kept within those prison walls are as real as a next-door neighbor. It's a specific story about specific people in a specific situation...but it is told in such a way that its themes can be applied to many people, and many situations. Such a good story, so well-made, and offering such a positive message of hope and (yes) redemption...why wouldn't anyone treasure this film?"	5.0	To believe in hope	2007-07-09	2	2	0

This film should top all the lists for the best of 1994. Great acting, great photography, great script, great direction: the script particularly is a work of art; not a single word is wasted in telling the story of two men who become friends in prison.I can't really say any more about the plot without spoiling it, so trust me, it's full of twists, and turns and surprises, and is ultimately, extraordinarily fulfilling. Andy (Tim Robbins) is possibly the only wrongly convicted killer in Shawshank Prison. None of the other prisoners believe that he's innocent, of course, and for a long time the viewer doesn't know what to believe either. Andy was a banker, and very smart. He's also very patient, and his patience serves him well in his finest hour. He becomes friends with Red (Morgan Freeman), a lifer who's already served two decades when Andy arrives at Shawshank. Red can arrange to smuggle anything into the prison-- anything at all. We learn this at the beginning, but don't realize its importance until much later. There's some wonderful foreshadowing that is so subtle, most viewers won't pick it up until it plays out.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are understated and perfect. Their characters are so solid, it's easy to forget that these are actors we've seen many times before, in other roles. The supporting cast is great as well.The camera work is superb. In the greatest movies, the camera is not just a machine for recording the action, but is an active participant in telling the story. That is quite true here.I seem to be draining the pool of adjectives dry of all compliments, but this film earns them. It's two and a half hours that will be some of the finest in your life.	5.0	Flawless	2003-11-23	5	4	1
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ABWHLZFEM5SZY	R. Jensen	This review is from: The Shawshank Redemption [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)Like with most people I took forever to see this movie, but that was actually because I knew the ending. In the end one day I decided I'd had enough and streamed the movie. Boy was I glad I did.Like with Bicentinal Man, Poweder, Slumdog Millionaire and The Invisible I was amazed at how a movie with such a simple premise could be so powerful and emotion creating. I got almost every emotion from this movie, albeit not at a huge scale as I could predict some scenes. I was also very impressed at how the movie gave a realistic description of a world within a world and how prisioners start up their own culture. Also the great concept of &#34;Institutionalized&#34;, before I watched this movie had someone mentioned this concept I would just brushed them off now, I knew what Red means. I am used to living on a limited budget, the concept of having lots of money to burn and not save, feels foreign to me now.Also despite moderate pacing, there was never a dull moment in the movie untill we see the medow Andy talked about. That part could've been shortened by many seconds. The only other gripe (SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT, SO JUMP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH) involves the giant posters, but that should be easy to figure out.Very good movie 5/5 Critique, 4.8 personally.	5.0	Awesome	2013-09-09	0	0	0

The pacing is very well done, the music outstanding, and I always enjoy watching it.  The message is wonderful, no matter how dark or dreary, no matter how loathsome life can become, there is always hope.  There is always a way to get out and start again.  The only regret I have for this film is that it wasn't highly considered in the award season because it came out the same year Forest Gump did.	5.0	My favorite film	2012-04-29	2	2	0

J Rey	"Academy Award winners Tim Robbins (Mystic River) and Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby) shine in the outstanding 1994 prison drama ""The Shawshank Redemption"". Set in the 1940s, successful banker Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is wrongfully accused for the murders of his wife and lover and is sentenced to serve two life sentences at Shawshank Prison. Over the 20 years, Andy eventually gains the respect of his fellow inmates and forms a strong friendship with a resourceful life-timer (Freeman). Based on the novel by Stephen King, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a perfectly crafted and emotionally moving film triumph. The 142-minute drama features a compelling plot and great performances by Robins and Freeman. The fine cast also includes Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, William Sadler and James Whitmore. Though ""The Shawshank Redemption"" failed in theaters, it received favorable reviews from critics, was nominated for seven Academy Awards and gained a strong following upon television airings and home video release.If you haven't picked up this fantastic film then don't miss out on ""The Shawshank Redemption"" Special Edition. The 1994 prison drama is presented in a fine 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The Special Edition has exactly the same transfer as the earlier DVD release but it is still a sharp and colorful transfer. The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound is clear and well balanced. The 2-Disc DVD includes an audio commentary with writer/director Frank Darabont, two detailed behind-the-scenes featurettes, a 42-minute interview with the film's director and cast, trailers and a 24-minute spoof of the film.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AHBNPMHDWZ7SB	RJ Smoove	"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films that I have ever seen. It may well be the best period. For quite a while it has ranked at #1 on the internet movie database, and with good reason. Not often does a film seamlessly blend gripping dramatic storytelling, with moments of lighthearted humor, as well as moments of deep sadness like this one does. I'm sure that just about everyone has seen this film, but I'll still run through the main plot really quick. An intelligent banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) discovered that his wife was stepping out on him with another man. After a night of drinking, and misguided decisions, he ended up in front of a judge and jury for their murders. In prison for life, he befriended a guy named Red (Morgan Freeman), and eventually the Warden (Bob Gunton). And the journey goes on from there. There are so many great things for me to address, but my favorite is the acting. The entire cast was perfect. Tim Robbins gave probably the best performance of his entire career. At first his character appeared quiet and timid, but after while he seemed to loosen up, and grew as a person from then on. Character development does not get any better than this. He also grew on me, and I felt like I was on the journey with him. Because of how great Robbins was at being secretive, I could not tell if his character was really innocent, or guilty. He also could not have done better at portraying Dufresne's deceptive intelligence. Andy Dufresne was definitely the whole package, and so was Robbins.When an actor gives such a powerful performance, there usually are not any other actors that stand out in the film, but The Shawshank Redemption is exceptional in many ways, including this one. Beside Tim Robbins's, there are a few more perfect performances. There could not have been a better choice for the supporting role than Morgan Freeman as Ellis Redding, or 'Red'. I was really convinced that he was a veteran inmate. His specialty was smuggling in things that his fellow inmates requested. Usually for cash, but cartons of cigarettes seemed just as important as cash in Shawshank Prison. I enjoyed watching Red grow throughout the story, right alongside Andy. In the beginning, Red was as guilty as they come. He knew what he did was terrible, and regretted it, but he didn't know how to convey that sorrow to the parole committee. Honestly, I'm not even sure if he was regretful for his crime, or the fact that he was in prison for life. Every ten years when he got his chance to face the committee, he was rejected because he wasn't confident enough with himself to prove that he was ready to be a member of society again. But he grew as a character and finally proved worthy, simply by admitting that he was young and stupid, and there's nothing he can do to change what he did.Bob Gunton was great as Warden Norton. He wasn't brutal and violent like his head guard Captain Hadley, but he still as sinister as your typical movie villain can be (without being one note and cheesy). He definitely earns his place on my ""Favorite Movie Villains"" list. Speaking of Captain Hadley, Clancy Brown's performance as the prison guard who enjoyed his authority way too much was quite memorable. Not often in film, does the secondary antagonist stand out as much as the primary. But like I said, The Shawshank Redemption is exceptional in many ways. Captain Hadley is right on par with Warden Norton, in my opinion. I cannot give so much attention to the characters without mentioning one of my favorites, Brooks. James Whitmore gave a solid performance as an inmate spent nearly fifty years of his life in Shawshank Prison. He appeared to be just a poor sweet old man that walked around with a bird in his pocket, but we later saw how institutionalized his time behind bars made him. It was really sad, and one of the most effective parts on the story. But enough of the actors. I always pay attention to the music in films. So with that said, I have to mention the wonderful score done by the legendary composer Thomas Newman. He has composed some beautiful scores for big films like WALL-E, American Beauty, Finding Nemo, The Green Mile, Road to Perdition and Jarhead. But the music he did for The Shawshank Redemption ranks among his best, in my opinion.I don't know what else to say about this wonderful film, besides how beautiful it is. I cannot think of anything at all to complain about. It's one of my favorite films because it never gets dull, and it never gets old. It's a film that needs to be watched, and rewatched. Director Frank Darabont has not done many films, but I doubt he will ever be able to top this one anyway. The Shawshank Redemption is a classic that should not be missed by anyone. And the Blu-ray presentation should not be missed by anyone either. This is a gorgeous looking transfer. A beautiful transfer for a beautiful film.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A8EMYIOE9SVR5	"""robbyk"""	I remember seeing this movie for the first time back in '95. The movie wasn't getting good reviews mostly because of its length, so I didn't want to see it in the theater. When it came out on video, I grudgingly borrowed  it when nothing else was available. 4 amazing hours later, I realized that  not only was it the best movie I had ever seen, but it was the kind of  movie that changes my whole outlook on the way movies should be.The  Shawshank Redemption is not about prison life, or about unjust crime, but  it revolves around human emotion and the strength of one man, Andy Dufresne  (Tim Robbins), who must find the injustice around him and find his own  freedom. It is also about how such a man can change the people around him,  like Andy does to Red (Morgan Freeman), the (as he puts it) &quot;guy who  can get it for you&quot;. At first, Red doesn't believe that Andy can make  it through a terrible place like Shawshank, but Andy continues to prove his  friend wrong everyday, because of his will to be free and his undying hope.Hope is another central part to this movie. Although Red warns Andy of  hope's dangerous grasp, Andy knows that it is the only thing that keeps him  alive, the only thing that can help him go on in the corrupt and filthy  world of the prison. And after the remarkable and surprising ending (which  is still exciting after every viewing), Red realizes Andy's great internal  strength.Frank Darabont does a terrific job with the directing and the  script; his adaptation of Steven King's novella is downright flawless. The  visuals and cinematography is also flawless. Flawless is really the only  word to describe this movie, and it is a shame that it did not receive the  kind of attention that it deserved. Thankfully, the movie has made a  pseudo-revival through video and DVD release. Robbins and Freeman (who  should've won the Oscar but lost to Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump)) are  sensational in their roles, considering the fact that they couldn't rely on  flashy sets of dramatic changes of scenery. Wearing the same clothes and  being in the same set scene after scene can truly demonstrate fine acting.I'm very glad that I picked up this movie on that one night; I learned  never to listen to critics drag on and on about film length, and to never  underestimate the power of one film. This movie truly shows the fine craft  that is a timeless movie, one that remains in your mind since the first  time you finished watching the ending credits. 147 minutes? Please, there  should've been more time for this movie.	5.0	A Flawless Masterpiece of Film	2000-07-02	3	2	1

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	"The Shawshank Redemption (Frank Darabont, 1994)At this point, I have two problems facing me: first, that I have seen The Shawshank Redemption more times than I can count in the past fourteen years, and have still never quite found the words for a proper review, and second, that everything I could say about this movie has probably been said more concisely and more eloquently than I could say it. Why add one more ""me too"" to the mass? (Yes, I did take a break and think about this question for fifteen minutes before deciding to go forward with this review.) In my case, I think I went back to Darabont's greatest success (to date) as a director after witnessing his greatest failure (to date) as a director, The Mist. That was a movie that had mountains of potential and blew it all. The Shawshank Redemption was a movie with mountains of potential that is almost completely realized. There are a few quizzical changes to the original text, but what made it to the screen did so in the best of ways.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man sent to Shawshank prison for a life sentence after being convicted of the murder of his wife. Dufresne maintains his innocence, but as we are told (those of us who don't already know, anyway), ""you can't throw a stone in prison without hitting an innocent man."" Morgan Freeman plays Ellis ""Red"" Redding, Dufresne's first friend in the prison, and the man who slowly draws Dufresne into a circle of the gentler, more intelligent prisoners, even as he's menaced by the, shall we say, less cultured of the bunch. (Even so, there does seem to be quite a bit of smoothing on the edges of this prison tale.) Dufresne soon becomes a force to be reckoned with inside the walls, cooking the prison's books, doing tax returns for the guards, and singlehandedly petitioning the state for money to expand the woeful prison library, where Dufresne works under the tutelage of fellow lifer Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore, who has mostly retired since his 1991 appearance in The Majestic). But Dufresne, whose philosophy is that freedom is all in your head, never does stop maintaining his innocence.The one thing that always confused me about Darabont's adaptation seems like the most minor of the changes he made; the thing with the poster. In the original story, the girl on the poster changes. It's one of the ways King uses to show the passage of time in the story, and it's an effective little tool; he shows not only the passage of twenty years of Andy Dufresne's life, but the changing fashions in the world outside the prison, as well. It's another aspect of Andy's ""freedom is all in your mind"" refrain, and it plays very well. In Darabont's screenplay. Rita Hayworth begins the trip, and Rita Hayworth ends it. Could the movie budget not afford two more vintage posters? That's the only reason I can see for changing such an effective detail. And while that's the only one that really stands out, it does plant the seeds. I'm certainly not saying it is in any way a bad movie; it is, in fact, an excellent one, one of the best ever made. I just wonder if, perhaps, it could have been just a touch better. **** "	4.0	Great, but as good as it could have been?	2008-12-07	1	1	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ	Robert Blake	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the kind of film we rarely get nowadays at the movies. Its the kind of film you can watch several times and it still retains a feeling of freshness and eventhough you know the secrets, watching the film never becomes tiresome. Taken from a Stephen King novella, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a horror story, eventhough it has truly frightening moments, it is a story about hope, patience and the human condition in general. Director Frank Darabont finds the perfect tones in cinematography, writing and casting to breath life into this story with great flare and intelligence. Like all great movies it never feels too long, every scene feels like it was shot, written and performed with great care. It almost feels as if Darabont is directing for the sheer sake of wanting to make a good movie, this is of course the same feeling we would later get from films like ""The Majestic"" and another modern classic taken from a King book, ""The Green Mile."" The framing of the story is brilliant, the photography is cold and rich, really taking us into the Shawshank prison and it's interiors. The performances are superb with Morgan Freeman really standing out as Red, our narrator, but Tim Robbins also delivers an immortal performance as the quiet, intelligent Andy who comes to personify freedom and defiance in a way only a great character could. Darabont's script has a wonderful style to its writing, it feels like literature with a modern twitch. 10 years after it's release (when like ""Citizen Kane"" it flopped only to be re-discovered later), ""The Shawshank Redemption"" returns in this impressive 2 disc set which gives us the film in a beautiful print and documentaries featuring fascinating stories from the making of the picture and interesting examinations at the movie's popularity and appeal to audiences. Few movies really reach out and actually move us, few directors like Steven Spielberg, Oliver Stone, Martin Scorsese, Fellini, Luis Bunuel and Frank Capra have actually given us movies that stay with us, embedded in our memories. Here Darabont does just that. Here is an essential viewing for anyone who hasn't seen it."	5.0	A Film Filled With Heart And Hope.	2004-10-31	2	1	1

I watch this once a year, and every time, it makes me weep with empathy.  There are wonderful characters, funny, pathetic, and strong, as they survive in a brutal prison, run by a corrupt evangelical christian sociopath; the warden is the perfect mirror for the horror over which he presides.The story is perfect, full of struggle and wonderful surprises, recounted by Red, the friend of Andy.  Andy is a remarkably resourceful man, who pursues several agendas at the same time, with patience and passion and pain.  Red, who becomes his intimate and special friend, helps him and then learns essential lessons from him about the value of life and freedom.  It is amazingly good and completely believable.Warmly recommended.  One of the truly perfect films.	5.0	one of the top ten best I've ever seen	2009-02-11	1	1	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A26JGAM6GZMM4V	Robert Morris	"Based on a Stephen King novella and directed by Frank Darabont, this film covers a 20-year period during which Andy Defresne (Robbins), a former banker convicted of murder, somehow preserves his dignity while surviving the brutalities he endures in a state prison in Maine. There are many reasons why this film retains its appeal to me during the eight years since I first saw it. Here are three. First, the evolving friendship between Defresne and ""Red"" Redding (Freeman) enables both actors to play off each other while developing their respective, quite different characters. (Color of skin is among the least significant of those differences.) Also, the unhurried pace of the film seems appropriate to the pace of life within a state prison. While seeing this film once again recently, although familiar with all plot details, I found myself relaxing and ""going with the flow"" the way many inmates presumably do. Darabont's skillful control of the pace givens sudden, unexpected plot developments even greater dramatic force. Finally, I admire Bob Gunton's portrayal of Warden Samuel Norton, a clever but corrupt and (when he deems it necessary) brutal public official. His fate is obviously not the ""redemption"" he has in mind for himself. FYI, cinematographer Roger Deakins was later hired by the Brothers Cohen to provide his services to the filming of Fargo. The Shawshank Redemption now has and certainly deserves a high level of esteem which it did not (but should) have when first released in 1994."	5.0	Gettin' ready to live or to die?	2004-01-05	0	0	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A22HXG8U4RPA9E	_rob_	This is one of the best films EVER, if not THE best.  Truly an inspirational work of art.  I just cannot believe its poor performance at the box office nor at the Oscars in '94.  I also cannot believe some of the comments uttered by critics against the movie, and would like make clear my views on the film.  First of all, how could you say that the movie is only an unoriginal prison film with an innocent victim?  The truth is, it is much more than just that.  It is about courage, determination, hope, and making the best of what one has, no matter how little that is.  It reminds us that good things happen to good people, to people who put their trust in the Lord.  Also, don't complain about it having too much violence/cursing.  As Red Redding says, prison is no fairytale world.  Is there any penitentiary in the world with no violence, where all inmates are perfect, and can read and write English elegantly?  There are just some words that they need to use to get the message across to others and us as an audience.  Next, why would you say that Tim Robbins is monotonous, when the character he plays (Andy Dufresne) is exactly that?  Andy is quiet-spoken, intelligent, kind at heart, and very touching.  In my opinion, all the acting was perfect to a tee, including Robbins'.  Finally, what about the music being too grim and bleak for us to bear?  That is exactly the feeling Thomas Newman wished to portray, and it fits the film perfectly.  The music is subtle, quiet and solemn, but also contains magnificent, heroic sections which are quite beautiful contrasts.  It should not be listened to alone, but rather only with the movie.  That is when the sound is most gripping.As you all know, there are two things which you can do with your life - get busy living, or get busy dying.  Well similarly, there are two things which you can do with this movie - watch it, grasp its true meaning, and admire it, or just watch it mindlessly without understanding its significance to our lives.  I give it six out of five stars.  A movie that will really hit home and can be appreciated by anybody - anyone with a heart and a brain, that is.	5.0	A monumental work...	2001-11-10	2	2	0

I'm not going to re-hash the plot.  However, I did want to make a point on the EXCELLENT novella this movie is based on.SPOILER ALERT: For those of you who have read the novlee, I'm sure you'll know what I mean.  The story actually has 2 endings.  Right after Andy escapes, that's the 1st ending.  Then the story picks up by Red writing in the Diary:  I can't believe that I'm writing in this diary again"".

I was the first time I read the story.  VERY different form King's usual stuff.WHich brings me to a story I have to relate to you all:I had told a young woman from Australia about this movie.  She later went to the video store with some friends.  She spots this movie and decides to get it because of what I said about it.  Her friends didn't want to see it because of King having wrote it.  She didn't listen to her friends and rented it anyways.  Well, she said that after watching the movie, her and her friends talked about the movie.  They ALL liked the movie (no big surprise there!)  And this woman said that the movie was TOO SHORT!!!!  True storyOne last thing I need to say about this movie:  I need 3 hours when I see it because after it's over, I like to just sit back and enjoy the feeling I get after watching it.If you want a emotionally fulfilling movie, BUY this movie, don't just rent it."	5.0	This movie doesn't deserve 5 stars...	2003-03-11	4	3	1

Truth is, I don't want to know. Some things are better left unsaid. I'd like to think they were singing about something so beautiful, it can't be expressed in words, and it makes your heart ache because of it.

The Godfather and Toy Story, without question, are the best trilogies.  Yet if you have to talk about a single movie that defines breaking the mole of true picture telling and movie making then The Shawshank Redemption takes the prize.  Now, as a fan of Forrest Gump, I never questioned whether it should had won a Best Picture Oscar, nevertheless, after finally watching Shawshank I'm beginning to think otherwise.  I've always enjoyed Stephen King films for their psychological thrill, this on the other hand has to be the most unique and fanastic piece of storytelling and character development in his career.  Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins gives flawless peformances playing incarcerated inmates who develop a friendship behind bars.  For 2 hours and 22 minutes this movie will have you captivated by the richness and cleverness of the film.  Simply outstanding!

Filled with love, hate, sorrow, and happiness, all viewers will be emotionally drained.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman play a dynamic duo.  The friendship and love created by these characters will cause tears to come to your eyes.  The Shawshank Redemption takes place in federal prison.  Tim Robbins plays Andy, a banker, who tells his story about his time in prison and his escape.  Andy is a character who is loved by all.  His achievements in prison out weigh those of persons in the free world.  Andy hurdles many obstacles in prison but always seems to be heroic in actions.

DO NOT listen to  what critic Leonard Maltin says about this movie being &quot;overlong&quot;  and &quot;hollow and predictable&quot;.  He is under no uncertain terms  nothing more than an idiot or what the British would call a  &quot;wanker&quot;.  The length of the film is necessary, the story is  nothing short of magic. The novella from which this is based gives all the  more credence to the idea that Stephen King will one day emerge from under  his undue shroud of literary cynicism as one of the 20th century's greatest  writers. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give possibly the best performances  of each of their distinguished careers.  If you can handle harsh dramas and  depictions of prison life then I suggest checking this movie out, putting  aside any pre-conceived notions, and enjoying this timeless classic film.  And when you're done go buy the movie so you don't wear out your local  videostore's copies!	5.0	One of the Top 10 films of All Time, A True Classic!	2000-02-24	13	12	1

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2B2U7LOWSQJ0F	Ryan McCabe	I bought the DVD of Shawshank and set it on a shelf for about two weeks until I decided to watch it. I had never seen the movie, but I had heard it was excellent. Whenever I watch a movie, I take everyone elses opinions and  put them aside, so that I may make my own opinion based on what I felt, not  what others felt. So, I decided to watch the movie and wad simply  overwhelmed by the story that is presented. I cringed during parts of the  movie and felt as if I were there actually seeing events taking place. I  felt sick at a certain point in the movie (I won't say where, but if you  have seen it, you know what I am talking about). And I boo-hooed at the end  like a little baby. In all, this movie is one of, if not, THE BEST movie I  have ever had the privilage of viewing. Writing about it even gives me  chills. Don't wait, buy this movie now, you WILL NOT be dissapointed at  all.	5.0	Wow	2000-01-21	2	2	0

Oliver	This is one of the few movies that has ever moved or impacted me in a way I can't explain.I'm usally a fan of movies with shootout fights, and excellent plots.  But this movie had a plot that made me careless about violence, I just wanted to figure out what happened next.  This movie kept me intruiged till the end.  With excellent performences by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.This movie just really captured my spirit in a way, very few movies and video games have ever captured me.The only bad thing is, is that when I'm done, I realized I missed something on T.V. or two hours and 26 minutes of my life just passed by.  But it's not really a bad thing cuz I wouldn't care what was on T.V. and That 2 hours and 26 minutes was spent wisely.To those who watch movies should definitly check this out, because altho it didn't win best picture, this is something Titanic, A Beautiful Mind, and Chicago could never be.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A15FJK2UH6OHXT	Sam Clemens	This is an excellent, excellent movie.  I never tire of watching it.  There are, however some snags in the production and plot that bother me enough to take one star away:- Could a person stay in one cell long enough to dig that big of a hole without having to disguise it in a better way than hanging a poster over it?  Don't they ever inspect? or paint?- The actual escape seem implausible.  I can go along with it, but I would rather see him come up with a bit more original and clever method- The closing scene.  If Andy made his way to Mexico with a good chunk of cash, I would expect to see him with a quiet but successful little business at a marina or elsewhere - not scraping old paint off of a derelict boat on a desolate beach.  Almost seems it would make Morgan Freeman want to go back to prison.  He would surely be taken aback!	4.0	Excellent, but..	2011-02-16	4	0	4
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A30KJH6O4NZC8B	Sameer Sakhuja	The Shawshank Redemption is, simply, one of my all-time favorite films.  Each aspect of the film clicks brilliantly, and the result is a film that is both unforgettable and an instant classic.  Nominated for seven academy awards, including best picture and actor it is a story that takes place in the 1940's about a young banker named Andy Dufrane(Tim Robbins) who is falsely accused of murdering his wife and is sentenced to life in the Shawshank Prison.  Andy's manner is quiet, patient and seemingly emotionless.  He's not the type to wear his heart on his sleeve, or to cry in public.  He leads his life by his own way and knows how to live it.  Unlike Andy, his best friend Red(Morgan Freeman) has a more pessimistic outlook in life and is embraced by Andy's character.  This movie shows you hope and inspiration can lie even in the darkest of times.  Surprizingly enough the story was a novella by Stephen King called Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.	5.0	Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying	2001-11-30	3	1	2

How can a movie with over 300 reviews still get an average 5 star rating? Further more the Movie was Nominated for so many awards, that's its impossible not to be tempted into buying it.Well I can honestly say that I was not disappointed. In my opinion, Shawshank Redemption is by far one of the best stories ever.I recommend shawshank redemption to evreyone. It is a movie which you would rather own than rent.It has all the elements of a good movie: Good acting. unexpecting yet feel-good ending. Amazing storyline.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1UG9YPUGMAJX1	Sammy T.	This is such a great movie on so many levels.  From beginning to end you are entertained and engrossed in the story and the characters.  The movie lets you watch the ingenuity of someone that realizes they are stuck in their circumstances and their greatest ally is time.The main character that Tim Robbins played, Andy Dufresne, basically moved a mountain with a spoon.  In addition to that he set himself up financially to be self sufficient after his escape.  He setup the 'not so nice' prison warden to be exposed for his mistreatment of the prisoners.  He gave his best friend a goal to look forward to after getting released on parole, Red, played by Morgan Freeman.The storytelling narration sprinkled in, by the voice of Morgan Freeman, captivated you and tugged at your heartstrings.The message I took away from this movie is: You can accomplish anything you set out to do, given persistence and time.I first read this as a short story by stephen king.  The movie brilliantly brought it to life even better than my imagined it.	5.0	Great Movie, Great Message!	2011-04-06	2	2	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A27NTH2Y9DAR31	Schuyler V. Johnson	I hope the Pacific Ocean is as blue as I think it is. I hope.This is really the perfect movie; not one single flaw, and every second of film is important and meaningful to the plot and character development. Movies are not to be rushed through; they should be savored and enjoyed, and this one has it's own special place in moviemaking.I have never liked prison movies, but this one (and the Green Mile) transcends the genre. It is not really a movie about a prison, it is a movie about hope and the strength of the human spirit despite unbelievable obstacles. Tim Robbins, as Andy Dufresne, is fantastic. Very slow, calm and with a shy, quiet wit and a keen eye to the human frailties of his tormentors, notably the warden and the brutal prison guard, he adapts quickly and learns the ropes about how to survive in an atmosphere that few could. Morgan Freeman, who narrates in his beautiful, soothing voice, plays Red, Andy's best friend, and the relationship between the two is deeply moving.Andy bucks the system, often, but not just to show off or be a smart alec, to improve the lives of the prisoners who must survive under a primitve, sadistic regime, and to help them feel like men, and have a taste of freedom and dignity. The first night that Andy is there, a heavyset prisoner, very young, breaks down and calls for his mother; unfortunately, he pays a high price for his emotions, in the first scene that demonstrates the true evil that rules this dark, Gothic world.Tommy arrives, some years later, a young, brash criminal in the making, with a great sense of humor and defensive about his lack of education; notably, his inability to read...this is resolved by Andy, who takes the young man under his wing and teaches him letters and eventually, Tommy passes his test.The next scene that really shocked me was the warden's response to Tommy's story about who the real killer of Andy's wife was; via a confession from a former cellmate. The warden and most of the guards have a vested interest in keeping Andy right where he is, after finding out he was able to save them a lot of money on their income tax returns due to his banker's background. Far too valuable a man to lose just because he was unjustly charged.SPOILER!But Andy is nothing if not resourceful, and he has had years to plan his escape...and not only an escape but one that nets him hundreds of thousands of the warden's own money, blows the whistle on the atrocities that have been going on in the little fiefdom the warden so enjoyed as his own personal outlet for brutality, and a permanent freedom to do whatever he wants to do with the money to do it with.The ending is one of, if not the, most satisfying it has ever been my pleasure to see, and wonderfully satisfying after all the horrors these men have been put through. Red eventually wins his freedom, and departs the only place he knew for a world that is strange, unwelcoming, and hostile. I love the scene of Red, after having walked for miles through deserted fields, he comes upon a buried box that Andy had told him about, opens it and finds a nice wad of cash. He looks around several times, although in the middle of nowhere; he cannot believe there isn't someone watching him; after all, he has been watched 24/7 for several decades.This money is his ticket back to Andy, and a reunion that satisfies the soul.I watch this every time it is on TV, and every time I do, I find it as wonderful as the first time...and enjoy it just as much, if not more; it is a movie that doesn't lose impact after repeated viewings and actually makes you feel good after seeing it, because it proves that no matter how bleak things are in your life, someone else's is always worse, and things will get better if you only perservere...take a page from Andy's book and thank God for what you have.	5.0	I HOPE TO GET TO SEE MY FRIEND AGAIN	2005-06-07	5	5	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1C58YXM2A30CY	"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re..."	"Directed by Frank Darabont. Starring Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton.I just finished reading one of the novelettes by Stephen King, ""Rita Hayworth & the Shawshank Redemption,"" from the collected stories of ""Different Seasons.""  I was pleased to see that many of the points of the novel were not changed in the movie.Though the book has its dark moments, the movie is even darker.  And though I won't compare the book too much, I may allude to it from time to time in this short review.Plot:  Overall, it's about Andy Dufresne, a banker who had the unfortunate fate of being married to a woman who was cheating on him.  The book portrays Andy as a quiet man that the jury in his trial mistook for being cold and calculated.  As in the novel, the prosecutor goes over Andy's claim that he loaded a gun and then threw it away.  More likely, says the prosecutor, Andy shot the victims four times, reloaded and shot them again.Andy is totally railroaded.  Even though it's only a short part of the film, I'm sure that trials such as these will resonate with an audience.  Trials and being fair are part of the constitutional system of law in the United States.  To see it perverted and throwing a man into prison, two life terms, is quite a criticism of that system.The second guy in the mix is Warden Norton and his thugs as they run Andy so tight; they let him have his library and some semblance of protection from ""bull rapists"" as long as Andy keeps fixing the books for Norton's under-the-table schemes.  This is an interesting part of the tale - not only does Norton continue his criminal ways, but he also hides behind his Bible and his righteousness.  Scary.(Spoiler) There is a part of the tale where a prisoner, Tommy Williams, knows who actually killed the couple that Andy is accused of killing.  Andy sees this as an opportunity to provide his innocence.  The Warden Norton will have none of it.  In the book Williams is transferred.  In the film, Norton has Williams assassinated under the guise of ""escaping.""  Pretty thrilling yet amazing what some will do to protect their own interests, even at the sacrifice of others' freedoms.Bottom Line:  The story goes on, being narrated by ""Red"" his only friend, with some amazing acting skill by the veteran actor James Whitmore as a prisoner who's been locked up for fifty years.  The running joke of the Parole Board, the viciousness of the prisoners and the guards and the hypocrisy among the warden and his staff are very evident, very entertaining and shocking at the same time.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A16450ZDMMNA8B	Scott Unfried	One of the best films to come out. When it was released in 1994, it lost credit to the ever pop-culture appealing, Tom Hanks fueled film Forrest Gump (not a bad movie, but come on) this movie had far better storytelling,  acting, impact and endurance. Now I am glad to see people stand up and  really embrase The Shawshank Redemption in all it's glory.Tim Robbins  is brilliant as the character of Andy Dufrense who personifies hope,  patience and persistence, during his long spent time in Shawshank Prison  for a double murder, in which he was framed.This is basically what The  Fugitive would have been if the bus didn't crash, with Kimble  escaping.Morgan Freeman is beyond brilliant as Ellis &quot;Red&quot;  Redding who personifies friendship and a great heart, and has a really  heart warming ending narration.And it's about time to mention his narration  throughout the move which is perhaps the best ever, only rivaled by Robert  De Niro's narrations in Taxi Driver.This film works as both a character  study and a feel-good movie.When Forrest Gump becomes less respected, this  deserving contender will rise even higher! Has it all! 1. Historical  Importance 2.Defenitive or career making performances. 3.Excellent  big-screen directorial debut. 4.Great ending. 5.Realism. 6.Escapism(now how  is that possible, well it is!) 7.The ability to extract a strong emotional  reaction in which many movies can't.(Even from somebody who found  &quot;Seven easy to watch, and not bothered by gore, like in Blade) 8.The  cult following this film has recieved speaks for itself.Pure cinematic  art and entertainment rolled into one brilliant film!	5.0	The essential film of modern cinema,and 1 of of best period!	2000-07-27	6	5	1

If you are going to a 'R' rated movie set in a prison.....grab a clue.This was just a phenominal film.  Excellent story line,  exceptional acting and one of the best endings in history.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A324G4F6F7NHWW	Sekhar Narayanaswami	There are few movies (or works of art, for that matter) that have moved me as this movie did.  The tale of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover, takes place (for the most part)  inside the walls of Shawshank Prison, where he is serving his prison term.  From the beginning it is clear that Andy is different from the rest of the  inmates: he has an incredible inner strength and morality, and it starts to  win over a number of the other inmates, including Ellis &quot;Red&quot;  Redding (Morgan Freeman).  The journey to friendship that these men take is  simply a joy to watch... the two actors do a beautiful job portraying the  characters.  Moreover, the narration that Freeman does sets an incredible  job of setting tones and leading the viewer on an emotional roller-coaster.  In the end, the redemption that finally comes took me to a wonderful  place, and while it is strange to say that a prison movie can leave you  feeling like a million bucks, this one did.  I just can't say enough about  Robbins and Freeman; how there was no more mention of these two  performances at the Academy awards for that year is inconceivable to me.  I've seen others say that this movie is predictable... maybe it is, and I  just missed things.  All I know is that this is an incredible job of  movie-making: fine acting, directing that allows the movie to move at the  right pace and that doesn't overwhelm any other aspect of the movie, and a  story that makes the redemption very real.I agree with other reviewers,  in that it would have been nice if the DVD had more features, but the movie  itself is, in my mind, one of the finest movies ever made.	5.0	Simply Incredible	2000-07-16	4	2	2

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1B2QWRWYDD0I	shlomoh sherman	"Stephen King is one of my favorite authors, and of all of his stories translated into a movie, SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION probably ranks among the best. The casting is top notch, the direction almost flawless, and the musical score superb, and despite the errors in continuity listed below, this film remains one of Hollywood's best of all time. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are two my favorite actors and this film brings out their best.As I noted in my review of THINNER, generally Stephen King's stories do not translate well to film. Notable exceptions are GREEN MILE, SHAWSHANK, and STAND BY ME.SHAWSHANK is a tale of the triumph of the human spirit in a situation when an innocent man's humanity is trampled down with no hope for redemption or escape.Andy Dufresne, a bank president, is found guilty of the murder of his adulterous wife and her lover, a crime revealed late in the film, to have been committed by another man, a hardened criminal. But this is only discovered after Andy has already served 20 years of a life sentence.Andy arrives at Maine's notorious Shawshank prison in the late 1940s and is almost immediately singled out for abuse by one of its worst convicts and his pals who use Andy for their sexual satisfaction. But Andy also makes some good friends among the inmates, most important of which is Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding [Morgan Freeman], who is also serving a life sentence.While on a work detail, Andy manages to use his financial knowledge to help the prison guards with their taxes and money matters. He also gains a position as assistant to the prison librarian, Brooks Hatlen [James Whitmore]. But he is also later recruited by Warden Norton in a money laundering scheme in which Norton swindles the prison and the state of Maine out of thousands of dollars.Due to these beneficial connections, Andy is saved from further abuse by the sexual predators when the guards beat their leader into a state of brain damage leading to quadrapalegic paralysis.Andy is never able to prove his innocence but he does devise an ingenious plan of successful escape from Shawshank after which he is reunited with his fellow convict, Red.I originally saw this movie when it came out in the 1990s and was not able to remember some of the important details. But the movie was shot in Ashland, Ohio and Mansfield, Ohio. Mansfield is the home of my significant other and we toured many of the shot locations including the Ohio State Reformatory at Mansfield where much of the prison footage was filmed. Because I couldn't remember details of the film and because I wanted to write this review, I bought a copy of the movie on DVD from Amazon at the surprisingly low price of about $5.By all means. if you haven't ever seen this classic, rent it or buy it. And if you have seen it once, see it again and remember how wonderful it is.This and other movie reviews can be found on my website at [...]"	5.0	Fear can hold you prisoner.

It's gripping and truly a tour-de-force for both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. From the very beginning, you're completely riveted by the denouement of the story - picking up the crumbs as you find out what really happened in the most fantastical story of triumph over despair and second chances. It's one of those rare movies where the time frame is used so well that you're completely oblivious how long the movie actually is. Not to be missed!	5.0	AMAZING!	2013-12-07	1	1	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ABE14SVILZLNY	"SID ""Punk"""	"At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the ""only"" guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win. (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words ""His judgment cometh and that right soon."" The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect. You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you. As most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption."" Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears. If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie. She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs. Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with life on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red's periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb: there's not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the ""sisters,"" etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the ""redemption"" is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck."	5.0	Great story, wondrously told and acted	2004-07-18	2	2	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A34XPZS5DXA6HA	"S. K. Leggate ""Sunni"""	This is a film about patience, slow moving justice, and a life-long friendship all ending with a very satisfying close to what shapes up to be a wonderful story.  The main character, played by Tim Robbins, is a banker named Andy who's sent to Shawshank Prison on a murder charge, but as he gets to know a life-term prisoner named Red (Morgan Freeman), the audience is led to realize the banker's crime was probably justifiable homocide. We also realize that Andy's calm, patience, and fortitude, is more sutible to prison life than his new found friend Red thought.Shawshank Redemption shows that the typical view of a prison film which includes violence, brutality, riots and the sort, should be the only side presented.  It seems that it is typically forgotten that there are also instances of faith, friendship, and survival of an entirely different kind. Nominated for seven Academy Awards, Shawshank Redemption is a remarkable film, and deserves the critical acclaim it has received as well as the hearts of the public.	5.0	A Different Take on Prison	2003-03-19	1	1	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3KKM0T1KY42HA	Sky	"There aren't many film's that are better than the book (or short story...or novella) that they are based on, but The Shawshank Redemption is absolutely one that could actually be better than it's pulp predecessor.Back in 1982 Stephen King released a compilation of novellas under the title Different SeasonsDifferent Seasons (Signet). And two of the best King movie adaptations EVER came out of that book: Stand By Me in 1986Stand By Me (Special Edition)and The Shawshank Redemption in 1994.But what inspired me today to write a review about a 13 year old movie? Well...three things actually:1) I saw a customer review on Amazon today calling the 2006 video game adaptation-film Silent HillSilent Hill""visionary"" and ranking it 5 stars. I tried to think of movies that were 5 star movies in my book; there aren't many (relatively), and Silent Hill is far from 5 stars in my book. So, I was inspired to find a movie to write about that truly made the cut.2) I wrote a review today for the 2007 film adaptation of King's short story 1408 (see1408 (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)&Everything's Eventual : 14 Dark Tales). But 1408 was also far from 5 stars in my book, so I was looking for redemption in the way of something better to write about.3) And finally, I saw an ad today for the late 2007 release of The Mist, another film adaptation of a King short story this time from 1985's Skeleton CrewSkeleton Crew (Signet). But what's really interesting is that the director of The Mist is the same guy that directed The Shawshank Redemption...Frank Darabont...so my expectations for The Mist are very high! (Darabont also directed King's The Green MileThe Green Mile (Two-Disc Special Edition).)So back to Shawshank. This movie was terrific...one of the top 5 I've ever seen. It kept all of the most impressionable book scenes entirely intact. And keep in mind that this was a Stephen King novella, so there's some pretty interesting stuff (you can count on King to wow you with precise tales that include plenty of thrills...and when he doesn't thrill you he goes for the gross-out!).Importantly, Shawshank really captured the bonds of friendship so perfectly created in King's novella. The Shawshank Redemption was a moving, realistic portrayal of a day in the prison-life of a wrongly convicted man; the movie really is the novella come to life.Kudos to Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman for exact incarnations of the characters in King's story; kudos to Darabont for his direction; and kudos to all for putting their hearts into the roles to create a show that not only entertains, but evokes emotional reminisces in viewers that grew up in a very different world from today.The Shawshank Redemption is truly worthy of it's 5 stars here at Amazon, and it should be added to your collection."	5.0	King Of King Adaptations	2007-10-09	6	6	0

It's a movie that's not so much about why these men are in prison but how they handle being in prison and how they would be able to handle regular life after they get out.

There is really no way that you could knock a movie like this. Beautiful acting, direction, cinematography, and even gives a nod to Les Miserable near the end, and that deffinitly makes it a big winner in my book. Did I mention the symbolism? Steven King did such a masterful job on not only directing, but touching on deep themes on race, purigatory, and what it truly means to be free (and this is just a scratch on the surface compared to everything Shawshank tries to say).Movies at this calibar are extremely hard to find, but even harder not to love every single minute.

It did horrible at the box-office but in 1995 the VHS stormed the charts as one of the best selling VHS videos of all time.  The classic film is finally on DVD.Andy Dufrense (played by Tim Robbins) is sentenced to life in prison for two murders he didn't commit in 1947.  Of course there's not a soul who believes he's innocent.  Soon Andy meets Red (Morgan Freeman) who is a man who knows how to get things.  There's only one thing Andy really wants, Rita Hayworth.  Andy is a smart man, and when people figure out what it is he's doing with Rita Haywroth, it's far too late for them to do anything about it.You'll notice that The Shawshank Redemption has no choppy, cheesy special effects and you'll notice it doesn't have a lot of humor.  But what you will notice is it has fine performances, a story and the most uplifting message a movie has ever given before.  By Andy not giving up hope, he was able to survive Shawshank, the prison ruled by a sadistic warden.A good story makes a good movie.  Sure it didn't have a lot of special effects, but it had a story to tell, and that story was an uplifting story showing you how far hope can get you.

Based on the ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" novella that appeared in Stephen King's Different Seasons and directed by Frank Darabont, The Shawshank Redemption is the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a young banker who is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to life in the Shawshank State Prison in Maine.  His guts and resourcefulness earn the friendship of Red (Freeman), a lifer who is known around the prison for procuring otherwise unattainable things, such as the rock hammer Andy uses for his sculpting hobby.  Because of Andy's will to survive the harsh conditions of the prison as well as the corruption of the warden and the guards he soon earns the respect and friendship of the other inmates as well.  Although Andy seems to have accepted his life sentence, the other inmates soon find out otherwise when it is discovered that he might not be the guilty party in the murder of his wife and her lover after all.All in all, The Shawshank Redemption is a very good movie with a fine supporting cast in Bob Gunton (the warden), James Whitmore (Brooks), Clancy Brown (the head guard), William Sadler, and Gil Bellows.

Darabont had worked once before with adapting King's fiction in his film school, award-winning, three year long production of ""The Woman in the Room"" -- a movie Stephen King says is one of the ten best fiction-to-movie adaptations ever made. Darabont was best known for directing modern remakes of ""B"" movies when he first optioned Shawshank (The Fly and The Blob and the USA television movie Buried Alive).His Shawshank Redemption is the story of a man wrongfully charged with the murder of his wife and her lover, a man sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison, and this man's undying spirit of hope in a place where hopes seems all but lost. Tim Robbins plays this character: Andrew Dufresne. Dufresne's kindness and intelligence help him to make friends with both the prisonkeeps and the prisoners. Morgan Freeman plays Ellis Boyd Redding, ""Red"" to his friends, a ""man who can get you things"" and Freeman's voice-over narration gives the film both a world-weary and noble sensibility. In one respect, Red is just as intelligent as Dufresne (albeit a kind of ""street smart"" intelligence) -- each know how to work within the system. However, Red keeps quiet around authority, whereas Dufresne draws into a more involved (and dangerous) working relationship with the guards and the warden.It is an emotional drama -- one where friendship and kindness rises above cruelty and injustice. Hence, it is kind of ""romantic"" in the classical sense; that is, you ain't gonna find any prison in the US where guys are this buddy-buddy. However, this is balanced (in my opinion) by Roger Deakin's masterful cinematography, and the story's ultimate message of hope. I believe Deakins won an Oscar for his work and though the venerable cinematographer's collaboration with the Coen brothers may give you a better understanding of his range -- it is clear in Shawshank that his range is damn well, wide open. If ever you wanted to learn cinematography, Roger Deakins is the man to study. His camera work gives life to scenes that are ostensibly void of life, and his masterful work with black and white, with light and color, is one of the major components that gives Shawshank its powerful psychological tension and brilliance.Bob Gunton plays the sanctimoneous and corrupt Warden Norton, and Clancey Brown turns in a fine performance as the brutal Captain of the Guards, Byron Hadley. I also enjoyed the performance of Brian Libby as the jocular ""Floyd"". And several of the scenes with James Whitmore's ""Brooks Hatlen"" are heartrenderingly emotional. Noteable also is the Hank-Williams loving ""Heywood"" played by William Sadler, and Gil Bellows's first film role as ""Tommy"".My two favorite scenes are: 1) the scene with the prisoners drinking beer atop the license plate factory and 2) the final scene, filmed in the US Virgin Islands. These are the images that stay with me the most after viewing this film. They are the scenes where prisoners are made free, and the story rises above existential bleakness. They are colorful and alive, intended to show redemption realized. Altogether ""The Shawshank Redemption"" may well be my favorite ""stuck on an island"" movie because it is the story of hope realized no matter the circumstances. It offers us the possibility of redemption from injustice, futility, and despair. It offers us a story wherein kindness and belief triumph. And in that, it may well be one of the finest movies of the human spirit at its best."	5.0	Hope Realized	2002-06-18	3	2	1

I was very disappointed; itwas way too long, and had the usual hollywood baggage. In 20 years no 1 ever ages. Only 1 prisoner ever admits their guilt. Anyone with a religious view point Is of course a vicious hypocrite. Robbins's Portrayal is so understated as to border on comatose. The climactic development Is patently ludicrous morgan freeman is great.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2VP7JOT3K7PFM	"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie"""	"+++++This movie, adapted from Stephen King's short novel ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" can be summarized easily.  It tells the story of quiet banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who has been unjustly sent to Shawshank Prison to serve a double life sentence.  In prison, he forms a strong friendship with long-time inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (played exquisitely by Morgan Freeman) who, though he doesn't realize it, helps Andy escape after 19 years in prison.  Also, help for this escape is provided by Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Monroe, Rachel Welch, and geology!!But there is more to this movie--much more.  Even a wrongful imprisionment, a corrupt warden and a ruthless prison guard captain (played superbly by Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown respectively), and enemies within the prison (such as Bogs and his ""sisters"") cannot get the best of Andy.  Why?  His hope never dies.  This is the art of this movie: it perfectly paints a picture of a man who will not give up the only thing that can't be taken away from him--hope.This is also a magical movie since you are completely enveloped in Shawshank from the very first movie shot.  You experience a prison life composed of routine, after routine, after routine.  This is one reason the movie is relatively long: to get the viewer involved in this routine.  Also, the long length of this movie gets across the passage of time which is crucial to this story about patience, the squeaky wheels of justice, and the growth of a long-term friendship.All actors in their supporting roles do a fantastic job and some of these roles have been mentioned above.  Also, look for James Whitmore's heart-wrenching portrayal of Brooks, a very long-term inmate.Something else that should be mentioned is Freeman's narration as Red.  His voice when he is narrating seems to add to the movie.  In fact, I can't imagine the movie without his narration!Here's other things that you'll find in this movie: contrasts, opposites, unpredictability, humor, persistence, justice and redemption, renewal, and the importance of freedom.At the end of the movie, there is a double surprise ending.  These endings answer two questions: (1) How did Andy escape? (2) How does Red benefit from Andy's escape?Since this is an all-male prison movie, there is some violence and foul language.  But these are not gratuitous and add realism to the movie.This movie has many memorable lines.  My two favorites are as follows: (1) ""Get busy living or get busy dying"" (2) ""Hope is a good thing--maybe the best of things.""This is one of the few movies where subsequent viewings actually enhances its impact.  Why is this?  Because there are so many wonderful things on-screen that are presented to the viewer.The only minor complaint I have with the movie is that it sometimes can be unrealistic.  But this can be forgiven since the story is so engrossing.In conclusion, as mentioned Andy escapes Shawshank prison.  The viewer, however, will find the she/he cannot escape watching this powerful movie!!(1994; 2 hr, 20 min; widescreen)+++++"	5.0	Prison Escape Involving R.Hayworth, M. Monroe, & R.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1FNES0QEBJZD1	Steve Douglas	No matter how many times I see this film, it never loses its power.  I have had the Standard Def version for a long time and just bought the Steelbook on Blu Ray. Glad I did.  It was up for 7 Oscars and, criminally, didn't win one.  I won't be redundant and go through a summary of the storyline and sub plots, discussions of the acting,book, etc.  It's been done so I will only focus on the quality of the transfer itself.VIDEO....The transfer to blu ray is as clean as you can expect it to be.  There were no artifacts or film stock dirt anywhere that I could see though I doubt if this is a complete remastering of the film.  The color grading tends to produce muted colors, often somewhat desaturated to match the bleakness of the prison environment.  Contrast on the Blu Ray has definitely been boosted and improved from what I can see comparing it to the Standard Def release.  Details in background scenes tend to be a bit soft but are razor sharp in many of the close ups.  Details in dark scenes are not hidden behind crushed blacks making for a good video transfer.AUDIO.... This is more of a dialogue driven film so do not expect much coming from your surround speakers or your sub.  There are some left and right foley from the front sides and the rears are used somewhat for that ambient echo of doors closing and cell bars sliding shut but that is about it.  The lossless Dolby True HD 5.1 audio does provide for a very clean and transient dialogue, easy to hear and understand even in whispering moments.  Lossless audio, even when the full theater system is not in use, still provides a much more transparent listening environment.EXTRAS...Can't say I have watched them all yet but there are plenty of good extras here.  I did watch the 1/2 'Hope Springs Eternal' extra and found it very interesting and moving as well. There is a great parody of Shawshank Redemption call 'Sharktank Redemption' that is a must to watch and is dedicated to production/film agent assistants. It's excellent.  I look forward to seeing the others. The trailer is also in high def and there is a comic spoof on the film which I have yet to watch as well as a collection of stills, storyboards and more.If you don't already own this film on Standard Def, why not?  If you do, get the Blu Ray anyway as it is well worth it and will remain an iconic film with legs for years to come.All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.Thanks for reading.	5.0	Shawshank Redemption, Blu Ray Steel Book	2013-05-16	2	2	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3LVM9SXRGAU34	"steve jones ""spjones1856"""	I love this movie. It is one of those special movies that if you catch it on TV you have to watch it to completion. It is one of the best movies of all time. I think that all of the reviews for this movie missed the mark. The shawshank redemption is not about andy, it is a movie about red. How can you be redemed for somthing that you did not do. Andy was innocent, red was not. the story was told through red's eyes. He was the one who's soul was redemed. It was a movie about rehabilitation. It was not about a corrupt prision system, although the one in the movie was screwed up, it was not a movie about how the human spirit could overcome, although this movie did that. It was a movie about how red had come to the relaization of what his actions had on his life and the life of others. For that reason this is a great movie. Every one should own this or have TBS so they can watch it whenever they want.	5.0	the shawshank redemption	2004-10-20	8	7	1
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2RHQMV5GD18Z8	Steven Aldersley	The Shawshank Redemption sits at the top of the IMDB Top 250 with a rating of 9.2/10, so it clearly appeals to the majority of those who have seen it. It's also hated by some because they can't agree that it's the best film ever made. While I understand that argument, I find it difficult to believe that the haters can't respect it on some level. However, I don't care about any of that, I love the film.The story begins in 1946 with the trial of Andy Dufresne (Robbins) and we see him convicted for murdering his wife and her lover. The next 30 minutes shows him arriving at the prison and slowly adapting to life behind bars. Darabont uses a number of violent scenes to establish that prison life is somewhat brutal, but he doesn't dwell on it as the film progresses.This is a film about hope and friendship more than anything else. It just happens to be set in a prison. Andy befriends Red (Freeman), because he's a man who knows how to obtain items from the outside world. Their friendship and mutual respect is there from the start and develops throughout the film.Andy is an educated man and he finally attracts the attention of the most brutal prison guard in a memorable rooftop scene. The guard has inherited some money and fears that the IRS will take a big chunk. Andy shows him a way to avoid losing any of it. That single event is the catalyst for significant change in Andy's life. The guards begin to protect him and he's given a job which enables him to use some of his knowledge. He's well-liked by both the inmates and the guards.Warden Norton (Gunton) is one of the most corrupt men in Shawshank, even though he runs the place. He seems fairly harmless, but he's actually evil, greedy and dangerous. He provides the main source of conflict in the film.Andy strives to improve prison life for everyone, as evidenced by his campaign to win funding for the library. He makes the best of his situation at all times.The final 30 minutes of the film is extremely uplifting. Stephen King wrote the short story on which the film is based and his influence can clearly be seen. One of the things I like about King is the sense of justice present in his stories. If you think back to The Green Mile, you'll see what I mean. The Shawshank Redemption covers 20 years of Andy's life. Darabont wanted the final scene to be omitted, but the conclusion is still incredible.In the 18 years since the film was made, you've probably heard dozens of Morgan Freeman voice-overs. If you watch the film, you'll see why.One of the themes present in the film is how inmates can become institutionalized. Imagine being in prison for 50 years. How would things have changed in the outside world? It would be bad enough missing 20 years. Think about the advances made since the early 1990s. If you stepped out of a prison cell after 20 years, wouldn't you wonder why everyone walked around talking into their cellphones? You might light a cigarette and be arrested.I would recommend The Shawshank Redemption to anyone. You might not like it, but there's a strong chance you will. Robbins and Freeman are both superb. I watch the film twice a year and never tire of seeing it.	5.0	Hope is not a dangerous thing	2012-03-19	4	3	1

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A9QQ4HE8DDW6Q	Steven K Davis	Although Shawshank Redemption is an outstanding, almost mystical tale of desperation tuned redemption, it is necessary to understand the etymology of Hope as it derived from the original story &quot;Rita Hayworth and the  Shawshank Redemption.&quot; As it is, Stephen King published a book  &quot;Different Seasons,&quot; containing four novellas, each one  representing a different season of the year. &quot;The Body&quot; (later  made into the film Stand By Me) was subtitled &quot;fall from  innocence,&quot; where the novella &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; (also made into a  movie of the same name) was subtitled &quot;summer of corruption.&quot; The  important issue here is that &quot;Rita Heyworth,&quot; was subtitled  &quot;hope springs eternal.&quot; This subtitle is one of the most  important themes in the book, and it carries well into the movie; however,  it is necessary to understand that Hope IS the theme to this story. So, no  matter how much is said concerning historical accuracy, larger than life  characters, et cetera, it doesn't matter. This is not a work belonging to  the school Realism, but of a work that lives on as a way of life, a legend,  or a map to the redemptive nature of the soul of man. Nietzche spoke of his  torment and torture as spiritually rewarding, molding him into a better  man; perhaps his review of &quot;Shawshank&quot; would be similar: the  human soul, although fragile, finds redemptive power in Hope.	4.0	The element and etymology of Hope. . .	1999-12-03	27	14	13
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AL277B4AQCWBG	Steven Reynolds	"Unlike Frank Darabont's more recent efforts, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is near perfect. Not only the pinnacle of the prison film genre, it's one of the best films of all time. Everything works here: the screenplay is stunning; the performances flawless; it looks great, sounds great; and at 142 minutes it's perfectly paced. A film spanning two decades of developing friendship needs to be long, but Darabont unwinds his tale with such consummate skill that your interest never wanes. In fact, it keeps growing. He makes us feel for Andy, Red and their fellow cons, so their quest for dignity and survival becomes our own. The vignettes mix comedy and violence, striking just the right balance between hope and despair. It's never allowed to stray into self-indulgent mawkishness. For raw emotional power, the climax and denouement are almost unrivalled; and the themes of hope and self-determination will stay with you forever. If you can get your hands on a copy of Darabont's screenplay, read it. I picked it up the other day in search of a character's name. When I looked up, two hours had passed and I was on the final page with tears in my eyes. It's that good."	5.0	Incomparable masterpiece	2003-01-03	4	3	1

Six years later I was at a local store feeling depressed after sevral bad things had happened in my life when I saw The Shawshank Redmeption tennth anivarsary DVD. My best friend has always said it was his favorite movie and I don't know why but I just decided to buy this thing. I went home and popped it in and two hours and twenty minutes later I was shocked that this movie had been around for ten years and I hadn't seen it in this way before.The Shawshank redmeption is more about long term friendship then it is about a guy in a prison. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are fantastic as Andy Dufrane and Red. The film goes on for a good two hours without seeming dull and there's great character devlopment. The prison break scene has always stayed in my mind and the score to the film is magnificent and I haven't heard a better one to this date. The last twenty minutes or so of Red's life outside the prison is wonderful. there's no bad part of this movie in my opinion. This film went larlgy unnoticed and even though it was nominated for 7 academy awards it won none. I strongly suggest that if you haven't seen this movie, please see it. It has a history of getting people through tough times (It got me through some troubling times) but even when you're not down it's a wonderful film and I can't honestly say I've seen a better movie.Ok, that was the film itself, but this is the ten year edition. I must say that the special's are not anything to get excited about. There's two documentaries. One on the themes and why so many people love this movie after it went to home video, and another on the acutal making of the film. There's a director's commentary on the film in which Frank gives us very good insight to the film, and there's a parody movie ""The Shark Tank redemption"" starring Morgan Freeman's son (Who also made a cameo in Shawshank redemption) and the interview between Charlie Rose, Frank, Morgan Freeman, and Tim Robbins. You'd think there would be more for ten years, but there isn't.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ARCY9L64XCIIW	Tarik Soliman	Every so often, I feel cinematic achievement reaches a new zenith...a point where I feel (albeit erroneously) that the bar of accomplishment can rise no more. Yet, as said, I am eventually mistaken, mainly due to remarkable stories of profound creative intensity. These are the creations that highlight vital essences of life and society.The Shawshank Redemption is truly an element of such a category.The Stephen King novella, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, is a relatively brief tale, a section of a larger book called 4 Seasons. Still, it is brilliantly adapted as a feature-length motion picture, with no flaws or injustices therein.If you are wondering why it is such a good movie, then you only need to think about one word: freedom. Think about what it means, and how easy may be to take for granted in today's liberated world. Set in the hardened American past, The Shawshank Redemption teaches us a valuable lesson about the fickle nature of sovereignty, and the inevitable boundaries that restrict us along the path of life. Still, despite the misery of indeterminate and forceful detainment, a love of life is found.As such, this film presents a quest like no other. The characters seek to transcend their enslavement in a vile microcosm of dubious honesty and ill will, cherishing the subtle scents of freedom that waft through the senses on a very limited basis. After seeing this film, you'll never look at a bottle of beer or an opera record the same way: when you have nothing else, such frivolities are your only ties to freedom. Still, the intelligent social analysis does not end at this basic level. Rather, it continues by showing the affects of being reintroduced to reality, and the ensuing overdose of true liberty...Nevertheless, as clear-cut as the overall theme may seem, a mark of cunning snakes through it...fervent...unexpected...The result will knock you out of your seat.

Timothy Robbins plays a man who is sent to Shawshank Prison in Maine for murdering his wife and her lover. We discover that Robbin's character Andy is innocent, and the just of the story is seeing if he does indeed survive his tenure at one of the most horrendous prisons in the country. Through all the torture Andy goes through (he is gang raped on several instances), Andy never gives up hope, especially with his African-American buddy, played superbly by Morgan Freeman. Bob Gunton plays one of the most evil men in cinema history, as he plays the dastardly prison warden, with no heart or integrity.""The Shawshank Redemption"" was nominated for seven Oscars the year it came out, but won none, mainly due to the fact that ""Forrest Gump"" was up against it.This two disc set has a ton of bonus features including commentary by the director Frank Darabont, interviews with the cast, and an episode from ""The Charlie Rose Show"" featuring Timothy Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and Frank Darabont.The film has grossed over $29,000,000 at the boxoffice.Roger Ebert says of ""Shawshank"" that it ""absorbs us and takes away the awareness that we're watching a film..."""	5.0	"""One of the Top 10 Best Fims Ever!!!"""	2009-06-06	0	0	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1UF6GIMK5U1Z5	"""themandgman"""	Everyonce in a while, a movie comes along that changes the way you look at filmaking. For the Horror genre it was Psycho, for Action, Aliens and for Drama, it is the Shawshank Redemption. These films change the way we look  at movies. They raise the bar for how a film should be made. The film  queitly crept into theaters in 1994, and was overshadowed because of the  lack of blockbuster stars in the picture. But that didnt keep it from  gaining 7 academy award nominations. The film focuses on Andrew Dufresne  (played to perfection by Tim Robbins) as a convicted murder sent to prison  for the murder of his wife and her lover, a crime he did not commit. The  film takes no prisoners in delving into the hardcore realities of prison  life. At first, Andy has trouble fitting in, often resulting in him being  violated by other prison memebers and guards. But one day, he meets  &quot;Red&quot; (Morgan Freeman) who changes the way he looks at life. Red  has the ability to access things for people, and through this, the story  progresses. Morgan Freeman also does the naration along the way, which is  worth the price of the dvd by itself. The film could have easily been a  disturbing and hardcore look at prison life, and at times it is. But, the  main focus is hope, and thats what makes it so great. As you watch, the  movie starts to grow on you. No longer does this prison look to be such a  bad place. The film grows on you. Everytime you veiw it, something new is  picked up which makes it that much more enjoyable. The music and direction  of the film is remarkable. The enemies of the movie, the warden and guard  memebers, all have there own distinct personalities. In every way, this  movie is a classic. It has friendship, hardship, hope and a true message.  If you buy one dvd, not for the extras, but for an endearing story youll  come back to and enjoy everytime, make this the one you buy.	5.0	The Ultimate Buddy Picture	2000-07-19	1	1	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3AUECYM0M0YSX	The Man in the Hathaway Shirt	"In an era when Hollywood applauds idiocy, where movie heros shoot first and make funny quips later, where leading men crush beer cans against their heads, where, as one social critic recently put it, ""Stupid people are cool,"" this movie stands as a shining beacon. The Shawshank Redemption got made because a famous author wrote the story. If it had been written by John Q. Screenwriter, it would still be sitting in a desk somewhere, and if he were lucky enough to get to pitch it to a studio exec, he'd get the patronizing lecture about how things like this just aren't commercial material. As it is, it's a small miracle that a story with no love interest, no women (not even a woman to come home to, the timeless clich&eacute;), no sex, little violence (and none of it glorified) and no special effects made it to the screen. But it's a more audacious film than that. The movie dares to tell us that the mind is a beautiful thing, the most beautiful thing. Andy Dufresne doesn't survive by using his fists. He survives by using his intellect. Name me another prison movie where that happens.  Heck, name me another movie where this happens, period.There are few movies in existence where the ""egghead"" raises the bar of those around him, rather than lowering himself to fit in and be accepted. Yet the film tells us, without being preachy or pretentious, that the chessboard is mightier than the sword, that Mozart and Moliere can do more to rehabilitate the soul than solitary confinement and license-plate making. Ask yourself this: when was the last time did a movie play classical music and did not either denegrate it, or show how pop music is really more ""fun"" and ""cool.""Yet few reviews of the movie really delve into this fact: the Shawshank Redemption unapologetically glorifies the intellect. All the more ironic that it was triumphed that year at both the box office and the Academy by an ode to anti-intellectualism, Forrest Gump. While Shawshank advocated thinking through consequences and taking action based on planning, Gump said ""Don't Worry, Be Happy""-is it any wonder it took home the gold?  Forrest Gump fell into the comfortable Hollywood niche of ""just ask for little and you will receive plenty""-funny how Hollywood's own never seem to live by that philosophy.  Shawshank challenged people to be responsible for their actions and motivated to change their fate, regardless of the ""systems"" around them.But, as Forrest Gump also observes, ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know how it's going to turn out."" The Shawshank Redemption has been redeemed on home video, where it has become one of the most popular titles of all time. Forrest Gump has done okay too, but I suspect in 50 years' time, when listmakes are compiling the greatest films of the decade or century, Forrest will be forgotten, while this film will stand alongside masterpieces such as Casablanca, The Third Man and The Wizard of Oz-films that also received lukewarm reviews initially, by the way. As Red might say, some things just take time, a lot of time. It's a lession Hollywood will never learn as it starts filming its next dumbed-down idiocy coming to a theater near you and going to Christmas video just as fast."	5.0	A rarity among Hollywood movies--it celebrates the intellect	1999-06-07	0	0	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1NSUJJCG73IRF	"The Tweeder ""tweeder16"""	"Director:  Frank DarabontCast:  Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, Mark Rolster, James Whitmire, Larry Brandenburg.Running Time:  142 minutesRated R for language, prison violence, and sexual innuendo.Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, ""The Shawshank Redemption"". Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.  Based on a short story written by Stephen King, the film begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins), victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis (Morgan Freeman), commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of King's equally noteworthy novella, ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"". In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.  While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does employing the cunning Thomas Newman (who would later dazzle us with his score for ""American Beauty"") showing recognition for the film's needs of an emotional score; the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong seed to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.  This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clich&eacute;s and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film, proving that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget."	5.0	The Shawshank Redemption  (1994)	2005-12-30	4	2	2

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2V2XRUGEYYCGG	Thomas Glebe	"This is easily one of the best prison/prison-escape movies of all time, but more, it's one the best MOVIES of all time, period.Set at a deliberate but never uninteresting/boring pace, the film tells of an unlikely, intelligent, passive, and innocent prisoner sent to a rough, rough place, Shawshank maximum security prison.  Run by a true sociopath warden who is a Bible quoting fanatic who practices hardly what he assumes to be in the position of preaching, he is as corrupt (or moreso) as the most corrupt guilty and abusive/animalistic prisoners he is in control of.  Tim Robbins has never been finer in a mostly dramatic role, and exhibits it throughout his ample acting talent.  Morgan Freeman, playing ""Red"" also has never had a better role.There are parts of this film that are quite difficult to watch, especially the prison-rape scenes, and scenes of the brutality and ""obtuse"" nature of the psychotic warden.  But they are all worth enduring, and very important to the overall concept of this movie, which is that there is something in the human spirit which is incorruptible and enduring, the sense of ""hope,"" the feeling that no matter how bleak one's situation and surroundings may be, keeping hope alive is essential to getting through the incomprehensible and obscene circumstances which Tim's character has to endure before his final reward, freedom.There are just so many good things about this movie, that it's hard to know where to begin or end.  The acting by all is superb.  The musical score is contemplative and powerful at times, and every situation and character is believable and seems well thought out and played consistently throughout.  Each scene has its own special grace and power, from the sublime and subtle.  Despite its length, this movie never bores, never becomes uninteresting in the slightest.  It moves along magically at its own speed, which is just about perfect given the subject matter.This is a story about trying to remain ""human"" in an inhumane place, and is almost existential in its various ways of pointing the importance of that concept out.  From the meek ""library"" keeper and his birds, to the scene where Tim Robbins KNOWS he's gonna be punished (in solitary, in the ""hole"") for his actions but he opts instead to treat himself and to the prison to some simple music, because some things are simply worth suffering for, to the final ones of ""redemption,"" everything clicks here, big time.Despite its length, when watching and re-watching (it's one of those movies you just have to watch parts of at least, time and time again) Shawshank Redemption, I feel tingles up my spine at certain parts and though I know the truly inspiring and touching ending by heart, it never fails to disappoint.  Every single scene seems so well thought out, not only from a coherent, reasonable, believable, and heart/mind tugging sense, but from an overall sense of ""human-ness"" which embraces the movie as a whole, start to finish.I can't recommend this movie enough to those who have not yet experienced its power, its grace, and its testament to hope, and faith, and belief that no matter what the odds, whatever the conditions we all may find ourselves in this game (sometimes very cruel and unforgiving) called life, keeping hope alive is or should be our first commandment.""Get busy living, or get busy dying,"" Tim says at a point when he's had quite enough of the vicious and barbarous circumstances he, an innocent man, has been made to suffer at what cost?  Damn straight.  Kudos to old-timer (and eventual suicide victim) James Whitmore as well, but every actor and every scene and every move in this excellent film is top-notch.This movie may not be for everyone, however, last I checked, it was RATED #2 (only behind the original ""Godfather"" film at the internet movie datebase website) as greatest film of all time.  While that may be stretching it a bit, there is little to quibble with here, and I wish it could've gone on for another two hours to tell the truth.A great, great, great, great movie.""I find I'm so excited, I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain. I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend, and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope..."""	5.0	A great film...	2004-08-28	6	5	1
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A30OXD42ZFYZLO	Thomas Keneally	"I have watched this movie more than a dozen times. Most of these people who have given bad reviews are due to their not liking Morgan Freeman's role. Well, this is a character actors' movie with the interaction between Freeman and Robbins. If these people cannot understand it, it is their problem. In my opinion, Freeman deserves an oscar for his role, it was fresh, original and beautifully done. Though Forrest Gump won a lot of the awards, it is my prediction that it will soon be forgotten. For instance, they have not announced relaunch of its DVDs, while there are 2 different versions of this movie that have been announced. You cannot watch that movie too many times, while this movie will soon become a classic (if it has not already become one, but that takes time). It is sad that people do not understand Morgan Freeman's breadth of acting. These people put it down to be the worst movie ever, it being boring etc, well that shows their lack of understanding of the movie. It is sad and their loss, as this is one of the greatest movies made. It was recently rated the greatest movie not to have won an oscar. If people wish to write an honest review, they should point out justified criticisms, instead of saying ""There is not a honest moment in the movie"". It is a travesty towards the others and most of us are intelligent, despite what these people think of us. Seeing the kind of movies and books that they like, it is obvious that they do not see eye to eye with the rest of us. Well, no one is asking them to watch the movie. My honest advice to the rest is please see the movie for yourself and make up your mind. This movie is rated #2 in the IMBD (Internet Movie DataBase), after ""Godfather"". No movie gets there by being silly, unintelligent or without good storyline, acting etc. It is a favorite for me, and I can proudly say that I know more about movies than these reviewers."	5.0	Disregard reviews of Kyle, Delorean and Joe Shabdou	2004-09-29	8	8	0

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AUY5FSOVQMD3H	"Tim Hill (""B.C."")"	"This review refers to the one disc DVD edition of the film.THE WHO'S WHO: Starring Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, Mark Rolston, Jeffrey DeMunn, Larry Brandenburg, Brian Libby, Neil Giuntoli, David Proval, Joseph Ragno, Paul McCrane, Jude Ciccolella, James Whitmore. Score Composed By Thomas Newman. Director of Photography Roger Deakins (B.S.C.). Based on the Short Novel ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" Written By Stephen King. Screenplay Written and Directed By Frank Darabont. This Film is Rated (R) For Violence, Profanity, Very Brief Nudity, Sexual Content and Suggested Rape; 142m. 1994.WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: Not surprisingly, this is a very powerful drama which has been adapted from the pen of Maine author Stephen King. I say not surprisingly, because this came from the same collected works which brought us the equally stunning ""Stand By Me"". King is not only a legendary horror novelist, he's also a staggeringly prolific writer of human drama, capturing each nuance perfectly and precisely and leaving room to bring those nuances easily to film. Director Frank Darabont pieced all the right elements into place to bring a faithful rendition of King's work to the screen (he would later do the same thing for ""The Green Mile""). The central premise is that of honest, forthright banker Andy Dufresne (Robbins) going to the Shawshank penitentiary after being convicted of murdering his wife. Protesting his innocence all the way, he remains determined to not let prison life crush his soul. He soon acquires a small group of friends on the inside, using them to support his idea of hope. Andy's inner light manages to touch everyone in different ways, not only fellow prisoners, but the guards and warden as well. His list of feats include (without giving away any real spoilers to the film) arranging a beer break for his friends while they tar a roof, building a better library at Shawshank, helping prisoners to earn their high school diplomas, doing taxes for Shawshank's guards and briefly (but memorably) bringing music into the lives of the inmates. The entire film has a tone of its own that closely captures the period between the 1940's and the 1960's. Adding to that tone is the sumptuous musical score by the always reliable Thomas Newman (""American Beauty"", ""Meet Joe Black"") and the stark cinematography by frequent Coen Brothers' collaborator Roger Deakins. The exemplary cast includes Morgan Freeman who not only brings his charm in front of the camera, but to the voiced over narration as well. Freeman turns in one of the best performances of his career (and that's certainly saying something) playing ""the only guilty man in Shawshank"", Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding. Even though this film came out a mere three years after ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" (in which he starred alongside Kevin Costner), Freeman appears to have aged twenty years...a necessary adjustment to make his character more believable. Tim Robbins, on the other hand, underplays his Andy Dufresne character in the early reels of the film, opening up only when one becomes convinced he's not going to show any true emotion in the entire movie. In some respects, that makes his character more enjoyable to watch as we uncover each separate layer of a very complex individual. Clancy Brown gives a wonderfully understated performance as prison guard Byron Hadley, a refreshing change from the outrageously over the top performance he gave in the original ""Highlander"" film eight years prior. The sleeper performance of the film comes from aging screen veteran James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlin. He can tell his character's whole story (fifty years of being institutionalized) merely with his haunted, sallow eyes. Still, the best moments of this movie come in the scenes shared by Robbins and Freeman. These two consummate professionals play off each other so beautifully that it's easy to forget this is only a movie and not an actual historical snapshot of two convicted prisoners. Ultimately this is a story of immense hope in a place where normally none is found. A genuine feel good film that will stick with you long after you've watched it.THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: This DVD contains a fair, relatively clean 1.85:1 widescreen transfer. A minimal amount of grain pops up from time to time but nothing overtly distracting. The grey, hollow tones of the film are accentuated, while the brighter moments tend to be slightly dust-colored. A fairly pointless 5.1 Dolby surround sound has been added which fails to fully immerse the viewer in its depths. The majority of the audio (with the exception of a briefly fascinating lightning storm) is reserved for the score, which tends to be a bit overwhelming in a few spots. The dialogue, however, is crisp and evenly separated while gunshots are upfront and brilliant to the ear. The background speakers are rarely utilzed, even where the score is concerned. There's also a French Dolby 2.0 surround sound as well as English and French subtitles, both of which are presented in drab coloring to match the feel of the film. The package itself is a wonderful recreation of the original video release cover, although it has been issued in an atypical Warner Bros. paper case. The disc has been painted with a display that features the lower half of the front cover, brought closer into view. The nearly two and a half hour movie has been broken up into forty chapter stops, a generous amount for a drama-oriented, slightly slow-paced film such as this. Bonus features for this disc include an enjoyable cast and crew information section which gives brief histories for Robbins, Freeman and director Frank Darabont. There's also a minimally entertaining production stills gallery, which showcases thirty behind-the-scenes photographs, and notations for the awards this film won upon its initial release. The only really meaty special feature is the original theatrical trailer (2:12). It's a neatly arranged presentation which spotlights the film's best virtues and captures the potential viewer's interest.THE YOLK'S ON YOU: Sorry guys, this is an early Warner Bros. DVD release. There aren't any hidden easter eggs I've ever heard about on this one.THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: For the raunchier viewer interested in the seamy underbelly of Hollywood's grand cavalcade, there's some slight nudity but none of it's the right kind. The only remotely interesting piece of sexuality comes during the opening credits of this movie when Andy Dufresne's wife (Renee Blaine) has her panties removed by her illicit lover.THE GORE REPORT: For fans who follow the cinematic blood trail Hollywood has left behind through the years, Tim Robbins gets a realistic bloody lip and the last gunshot wound inflicted in the movie leaves an interesting trace of blood, but that hardly qualifies as gore.SAY AGAIN: ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice really. Get busy living...or get busy dying."" - Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins)THE FINAL SAY: No, I don't recommend buying this DVD. Warner Bros. finally got on the ball in late 2004 when they released a two-disc special edition of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". It contains a commentary track with director Frank Darabont, two documentaries, interviews from ""The Charlie Rose Show"" and more. That effectively makes this one disc release of the movie irrelevant.PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM: ""If I Didn't Care"" Performed By the Ink Spots.

We also discuss the rights of formerly incarcerated persons. The film Shawshank Redemption deals with something more important than either of the other issues. What the U.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1LZVU5SRRM3VX	Timothy Michael Resh	At his worst, Stephen King is a horror hack who turns ordinary objects into supernatural killers that terrorize New England towns crammed with people with dirty little secrets.  At his best, King writes stories like Shawshank and Green Mile, stories that create memorable characters whose humanity is more of the focus than the supernatural.  Not that I haven't read plenty of both types from Mr. King, but this happens to be one of my favorites.Derived from a short story in King's &quot;Different Seasons&quot; collection (which also contains &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; and &quot;The Body&quot; which were adapted into the movies &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; and &quot;Stand By Me&quot;), Shawshank is one of the few cases where I can say that the movie was actually slightly better than its print predecessor.  Although I enjoyed the short story thoroughly, it is only a novella, and the movie adds significant breadth and depth that are lacking in King's narrative, as well as making the story more linear and chronological.  By making it less anecdotal, the story is much more cohesive, and Robbins' character arc is much more complete.Sadly, TNT has seized the rights to the film as a &quot;new classic&quot; and plays it ad nauseum, but it is well worth owning the unedited version on DVD.  Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins' acting is understated and subtle, and the supporting cast is impressive.  Shawshank is one of those rare films where everything just clicks perfectly, and all of the seemingly disparate pieces fit perfectly together to leave the viewer feeling as redeemed as the main character.	5.0	One of Stephen King's Best, Brilliantly Adapted	2004-03-11	2	2	0

I thought that it was really well performed by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.  It starts out as with Andy (Robbins) in a court room accused of a murder which he denies that he did.  They send him to prison for 40 years and then the movie starts getting  really good.  I mean REALLY good.  I have never seen such a good story  written before but now after I saw this I can understand that there are  some really amazing talent out there.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3D9F6B1FB3CR	"ToProtectAndServeAll ""Hope is a good thing, m..."	"""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things... and no good thing ever dies.""  Sixteen words.  Eighteen syllables.  Endless emotions.The work began as short story fiction which first appeared in a collection of four novellas by author Steven King.Different Seasons (Signet)- which contains the original RITA HAYWORTH AND THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and gave rise to three film adaptations from the pages within, (the stellarStand by Me, the limpApt Pupiland this film) - marked the starting line for this race, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION - starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in each actor's finest roles - marks the finish line.  But the race against time and tide that occurs across both formats has absolutely nothing to do with what the casual observer might suspect.  Contrary to what you might think, this tale has much less to do with a wrongly imprisoned man who manages a stunning and bold escape than it does with one simple ideal: Hope.  The story compels both the reader and the filmgoer to never give up on hope.Bettering the original text by miles, Frank Darabont's 1994 masterpiece captures and conveys the struggle, despair and - ultimately - the hope that exist at odds with each other in the life of wrongly convicted and (at first appearance) defeated Andy Dufresne.  The cuckolded Dufresne (pronounced Doo Frane - I mention this simply because when I first read the novella in high school, I could not for the life of me figure out how the pronounce the guy's name! - and played with a weariness and determination second to none by Robbins in all of his postBull Durhamglory) is arrested, charged, tried, convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the cold blooded, heat-of-the-moment murder of his Wife and her illicit secret lover.  All of this occurs within the first few minutes of the film, and following Dufresne's arrival at the upstate Maine, maximum security prison, we are off to the races.  What follows is a series of tests for the battle worn Dufresne; each subsequent hardship more brutal and vicious than the previous.  Yet all the while Dufresne holds onto the notion that hope will endure.  You see, Andy is an innocent man.  Don't believe him?  Neither does anyone else within the prison.  Not even his newest ""friend"", Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Freeman).  But Andy holds on.  And in time... prevails.Borrowing heavily from King's actual text, Darabont - who also penned the screenplay - moves the story into a tighter space.  Excising some of the characters (the numerous Prison Wardens of the novella have been spliced into one raging beast of a man, expertly played by Bob Gunton) and streamlining the narrative provide Darabont the means to bury the idea of fading but eternal hope straight into the heart of the viewer.  The basic premise is still present... in fact much of King's actual dialogue is used throughout the film.  But Darabont makes just enough changes to push the story in a more open and raw direction.  (The character of Red, for example, is a hard living, red haired Irishmen in the original story; Darabont cast Freeman and turned the friendship between the two main characters on its head.)I could go into greater explanation about how this film has affected me in a very deep and graphic way.  I could explain how the scene in which Andy, drenched in the new rain of freedom, arms outstretched to the heavens and standing alone as a free man for the very first time, sends chills down my spine every time I even envision it in my mind.  I could explain how the scene in which Red feels the need to beg for a bathroom break from his new ""Boss"" at the grocery store causes me to feel so sad for the lost soul that Red has become.  I could explain how the sad post script messages left by not only Brooks but by Red himself dug into the boarding house rafters bring on an insurmountable grief the likes of which I cannot define.  I could explain how the final pilgrimage undertaken by Red as he skips town and streaks southward on a Greyhound bus, reciting King's exact words along the way - ""I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.  I hope to see my friend... I hope to shake his hand... I hope."" - bring a flood of tears and goose bumps forward in my psyche.  I could explain how witnessing Andy and Red's final reunion on a sandy Mexico beach reminds me of the hope I hold onto that I too will have a similar reunion with my long deceased Mother in heaven.  I could but I won't.  And I won't detail more elements of the film as many here have already done so.  Besides, has anyone reading this not seen this film?  I doubt it.  What I would like to do, however, is to have the reader consider a different take on why this film is so moving and so important in the lexicon of Hollywood.This film is by far one of the greatest films to come out of the 1990's... a time when America was at war in Iraq - the first time around - and the stability of our hopes and dreams were in doubt.  Sure that conflict ended quickly.  But at the time, for many members of Generation X, (myself included) an all out Holy war seemed imminent.  Having survived the Cold War and the notion of immediate nuclear annihilation, (anyone remember the made for television movieThe Day After?) we were once again thrown back on our heels at the thought of further destruction.  Our hope was fading.  Perhaps Darabont sensed this when he optioned the rights to King's novella, originally published in 1982.  Or perhaps there were other more divine sources at work.  Who knows.  Maybe it just took that long to get the script up on its feet.  But whether it was Darabont, the Gods or just the ever present weight of time... this film came along right when we needed it to.  King's tale of hope is felt so deeply throughout the film.  This eternal idea that hope never dies.  Trapped by time and circumstances beyond his control, Andy chips away at a future free from the confines of cinder and steel.  So too did the rest of us. We just didn't know it at the time.  Andy's struggle mirrored our own.  The film provided a glimpse toward hope.Fast forward to 2001.  Steel came crashing down and fires surged under the ground in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.  Can you imagine a better time for the renewal of hope than September of 2001.  And again, along came THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  In 2004, the Tenth Anniversary Edition DVD dropped into our laps as a subtle reminder that hope springs eternal.  Sure, it came three years after 9/11.  But it also came along at a time when our hearts were beginning to heal and our minds were beginning to open.  And there it was once again, reminding us that good things never die.It is for this reason that I believe that THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is one of the greatest films of all time.  Showing us the path in 1994, and providing us a gentle reminder in 2004.  I am curious to see what 2014 will bring.  Curious and cautious at the same time.  But I know one thing that will be there regardless: Hope.  Because, as Andy himself writes in his last letter to his dear friend Red: """"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things... and no good thing ever dies.  I hope this letter finds you... and finds you well.""It is a credo that I live by and live for.  Hope.  And in a very real sense, every time I watch this film, hope springs eternal."	5.0	Hope springs eternal.	2009-01-20	1	1	0

Don't get me wrong, the short story is great, but the ending to the film is much more satisfying than the ending to the book. That is extremely rare. Often times these snotty, scumbag screen writers take it upon themselves to leave the most important story elements in, but to make the endings more ""user friendly,"" for want of a better term. Apt Pupil, and Dreamcatcher are two examples that come to mind. This frustrates me to no end, and I hate them for it. I wish these screen writers would all die of lung cancer.But with Shawshank Redemption it's different. There are more story elements, and the ending ... I don't know, how should I say it? It peaks.

A reviewer pointed out that these black bars are superimposed over a full screen movie, thus  taking away some parts of the movie at the top and bottom and making it  seem like a widescreen film. This is not true. In fact the opposite is  true, these black bars actually preserves the entire film. What you saw in  the theater is actually what you see on the TV screen. Note, theater  screens are rectangular in shape while TV screens are square. If a film was  converted to the TV screen without making any adjustments (imagine a  rectangle squeezed into a square), you would see vertical toothpick-like  figues instead of beautiful curvaceous human beings. In order to fix this  little problem, filmmakers decided to transfer their film using two options  - widescreen or &quot;pan and scan&quot; (full screen). To best explain  these two options, imagine a square (the TV screen) placed on top of a  rectangle (the theater screen) where the top and bottom of the square meets  the top and bottom of the rectangle. This is actually your &quot;full  screen&quot; version of a movie. The square would have to be moved left or  right (pan and scan) along the rectangle in order for some scenes to be  seen. What many people fail to perceive is that in full screen versions,  the left and right sides of a film are actually lost and cannot be seen. In  widescreen versions, the rectangle is put inside the square where the left  and right sides meet thus preserving the entire film. This is why you have  black bars on the top and bottom.	5.0	The Black Bars - What They Actually Mean	2000-06-09	12	8	4

What's more prison is a wonderful communist paradise where all the felons are perfect angels and martyrs of the state. That's perfectly wonderful. What I couldn't stand however was the worship of individual determination of perseverance that was idolized in this Hollywood tripe. That main character guy was terrible.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AY6A8KPYCE6B0	Tyson	"We all know that this movie is ranked one of the best of all time, so I don't feel it is necessary to go on and on about how wonderful it is.  My only advice in regards to enjoying the plot/storyline/etc is to read the novella by Stephen King first.  This movie adapts the book flawlessly, while keeping almost everything in tact.  When direct quotes from the book were used in the film, I started tearing up every time.Now about the Blu Ray.  Though I have yet to see a BD release that hasn't added a goodly increase in picture and audio quality from a likewise DVD release, you occasionally run across some that don't really improve that much.  With Shawshank, however, the improvement isn't just obvious, but an in-your-face smack of clarity that will even make the snobbiest blu ray fan's jaw drop open.From here I could go on to say how rich the blacks are and how warm the red tones look, but to be honest there aren't enough adjectives to properly describe the perfection of the quality.  ""Perfect"" is, I guess, the only one that comes closest.  This release shows exactly how the movie was meant to be seen.  It shows details and colors the way the director wanted them to be shown, it enhances movement, and blasts with glorious uncompressed audio.  It is, ultimately, a new release in that no one has been able to watch this movie at home with this much clarity ever before.  I cannot recommend it enough.Overall, this is a fantastic movie and a top notch blu ray release.  If you've never seen The Shawshank Redemption before, you owe it to yourself to witness a film masterpiece - but, I add, if you have never seen it before, you also owe it to yourself to read what is easily a masterpiece in the literary world as well.  Stephen King's short novella is more than worth reading, and at only a 100 pages you could probably read it in less time than it would take to watch the movie.And, of course, if you've seen it before, are a fan, or even if you already own a DVD copy, let me assure you that it is worth reliving all over again thanks to Blu Ray."	5.0	Beautiful Movie, Phenomenal Blu Ray Transfer	2010-09-22	12	11	1

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AK31FDPFBI1BN	vojelly03	"As one of my favorites since the first time I had ever seen it, drawing me in with its two introductions and plot development from the first five minutes. Every time the film was on television, watching it gave me something different every time. There was a new fact or scene giving another feel or theme within the plot. The Shawshank Redemption starts with two introductions, presenting both of our main characters, Andy Dufresne and Ellis ""Red"" Redding. Andy is a banker, falsely accused of killing his wife and her lover, while Red's background was never revealed. But even from the first few minutes of the movie, with these introductions, two main themes repeatedly jumped out from the story. Of the many characteristics of a film, themes are only a fraction of what makes this film fantastic, but with the two simple themes of hope and freedom.The first symbol of freedom displayed in the film is a negative theme. Right off of the opening credits, it could not be ignored. Within the first introduction, Andy's freedom was taken away from him by false accusation. Secondly, Red's introduction revealed him getting rejected by the Parole Board after twenty years in Shawshank Prison. Both scenes reject their freedom, but from there, it keeps building positively. Of the many examples within the movie, there is one that sticks out the most. When Andy finally does get out of prison, it's during a thunder storm. He stands up, raises his arms and his head to the sky; no words are spoken, and nothing but Andy's laughter, the rain, and thunder is heard in the scene. Just with this image, the theme of freedom produced is almost tangible. Thinking about getting out of jail after 19 years is unimaginable until the final feeling of freedom is revealed.The second theme is hope. This also begins negatively when both introductions produce negative hope. It picks up much more quickly though. Another main character within the story is a man named Brooks. He is older and has been in jail for fifty years when his parole was granted. But Brooks has a hard time on the outside. He writes a letter to his friends in the jail (consisting of Andy, Red, and a few others). ""I don't like it here. I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided not to stay..."" (he hung himself). This theme of useless hope re-emerges when Andy mentions his dream life. Red tries to shut it down, but Andy remains stubborn toward his fantasy. This theme continues a while later when Andy is gone and Red's parole is accepted. He is released (another example of freedom), but then experiences the same feelings Brooks does. Although Andy made Red promise to perform a task, Red doesn't see the point. Hope finishes out our movie when Red keeps his promise. The movie ends with Red finding a letter from Andy. ""I hope I can make it across the border. I hope I can see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the pacific is as blue as it is in my dreams. I hope...""The Shawshank Redemption offers so many more examples for hope and freedom than the ones used here. With these two simple themes repeated countless times in different settings, this movie keeps its audience thinking. There is always a new idea, theme, example, concept, or characteristic able to pick out every time the film is shown. I've seen it countless times and the two simple themes continue to stand out and support each other through new-found evidence. A recommendation to all, a drama never to be forgotten, and a movie that will enthrall new--and audiences for years to come, The Shawshank Redemption leaves a warm feeling of satisfied resolution."	5.0	Two simple themes	2013-09-22	1	1	0

They think it's the greatest movie ever made. I think it's a fine movie in many ways. But as a writer and former reporter, I notice small details. Too bad the writers of the screen play and the director didn't notice these:1. The movie takes place in Maine, but ""down east"" accents are as scarce in it as hen's teeth. The ""bad guys,"" that is, all the prison staff from warden on down, plus a few of the prisoners, sound vaguely Southern. The warden sounds especially like a Son of the South when he makes his little speech to the arriving prisoners about the Bible. The movie seems to ridicule both religious beliefs and white Southerners by making the warden a smug, tyrannical hypocrite.2. The lead character was supposedly in the prison for 19 years. How likely is it that the same warden, and the same guards commander, would have been there that whole time (never mind with their appearance hardly changing at all)? I sure don't look like I looked 19 years ago!3. There seem to be a fair number of black men incarcerated in the prison, besides the Morgan Freeman character. I bet in 1947 there weren't as many black people in the whole of Maine as are shown in Shawshank.4. None of the prisoners seem to have any family whatsoever, nor any contact, ever, with an attorney. No visitors, period. I realize things have changed in prisons since the 1940s, but does it seem likely that they were totally at the mercy of the prison administration 24-7?5. Why did the parole boards routinely deny all petitions for parole? That is never even hinted at; I suppose all the members were just no-good so-and-sos who liked to see people suffer.6. When the wrongly convicted banker climbs out of the hole he has chiseled in his cell wall, he has to remove the poster of Raquel Welch to do so. He doesn't go back to replace the poster. But the next day, when the guards find him gone, and the warden in a rage throws the man's rocks against the poster, it's back in place. Did the elves sneak into his cell and paste it back up?Just a few thoughts that occurred to me. Over all, it was an entertaining movie, though."	4.0	Very inspiring -- but ...	2006-08-25	19	2	17

Although some of the darker sequences are a bit murky, the DVD compression doesn't effect the look of the movie substanially.Tim Robbins plays a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover on circumstanial evidence and send to Shawshank prison for two life terms. He befriends Red (Morgan Freeman)while on the inside and begins quietly trying to rebuild as close to a normal life as possible behind bars becoming a good friend to Red's circle of friends as well. Most folks are probably familiar with this well written and directed movie so I'll skip any additional summation of the plot. Besides, to reveal more would spoil the pleasure of viewing this treasure.The first disc consists of the movie with a great commentary track from writer/director Frank Darabont. Darabont discusses the difficulties in adapting King's short novel and the challenges to translating literature to the screen. He also discusses some of the changes he made to King's novel to make it work better as a dramatic presentation and the challenges of casting, performance and location shooting. It's an enlightening commentary track that educates as much as it entertains.The second disc includes ""The Charlie Rose Show"" segment devoted to ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and features Darabont, Robbins and Freeman in a great discussion on the making of the film. It's clear that all involved enjoyed working together and that atmosphere carries over to the film that they created together. We also get 2 marvelous documentaries; the first ""Hope Springs Eternal: A Look Back at The Shawshank Redemption""  is a marvelous featurette that covers everything from what inspired Darabont to adapt King's short novel in the first place to the rigors of producing a film at an abandoned closed prison. ""Shawshank: The Redeeming Feature"" examines the powerful impact of the movie and features a number of prominent critics and individuals that both discovered this powerful movie when it played in cinemas and on home video. It's not as involving as the first featurette but does give a wealth of detail about the reach and scope of a work of art when it touches an audience in a unique, personal way.We also get the comic spoof of the film ""The Sharktank Redemption"" which is actually quite funny. I hadn't seen this before although you'll appreciate it best after having watched the movie. Storyboards, a still gallery and the original theatrical trailer are also included. All are of top quality.The Special Edition Boxed Set includes the BFI book published on the film. It's quite a good book and would be a great reference for film buffs. It's also got a wealth of insight some of which will be worthwhile to film students and hardcore fans of the film. On the other hand, the more casual fan will probably be quite satisfied with the two DVD set. The Special Edition Boxed Set also comes with the film's original soundtrack. The marvelous score by Thomas Newman doesn't have an isolated channel (my one complaint about this DVD)on the DVD so fans of the film who also like the beautifully written but restrained music by Newman will probably want this as well. Other than these two items (and a nice box) there's no difference between the two movies.Is this a great movie? It's a well made epic film that chronicles the redemption of two very different men that end up by circumstance becoming friends. Sure, it deals in some cliches but then so do all movies. It's used as short hand. What matters is that Darabont, like King, turns some of these cliches inside out for many of these characters. This isn't a film for those expecting the latest ""Jason"" movie but one that demands patience as it builds the characters over time. In many respects, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" reminds me of Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life""; it's about missed opportunities and a second chance to try and live life to the fullest again."	5.0	Deluxe treatment for a terrific movie	2004-10-05	25	20	5

The ending was brilliant, only Steven King could think up such a fine ending and only Frank Darabont could make such a great adaption as Stephen King carefully picked him to direct. You will love this movie. Also, if you liked this movie you will also fall in love with the brilliant &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, also written by Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont.

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AH64XXZBL1T6Z	Yaakov (James) Mosher	"Our world is a parable, a metaphorical prison. All men suffer and many feel this is unjust. Our better selves remain mostly jailed within. The best of us uplift ourselves, our companions, and our surroundings. It's a Jewish principle -- Wherever you are, be a kodosh (a holy person).Tim Robbins's character in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" pulls it off -- in more ways than one. The viewer is slow to warm to this soft-spoken prisoner (unsure if he killed his wife and her lover). But that how it is with truly great people. A person ahead of his time or standing outside of time is sentenced to be misunderstood and abused.Marvel at Andy Dufrense's (Robbins) triumph in this first-rate movie. It's a tad condescending toward the Bible through the character of Warden Norton but remains an excellent movie (based on a Stephen King short story).

I just purchased this believing it would be remastered but it was NOT. The quality was horrible not as bad as Tommy Boy on blu ray which I am still furious about because I do not see how hard it is to remaster or what ever it is they do to please customers, but you know how it is all they care about is money, screw the customers. However there is a new version of Shawshank Redemption coming to blu ray in November on the 16th, which I will purchase but it won't be a happy purchase. Enjoy the movie none the less, I can't say this is the best movie ever made, it's all up to you and what you like. To me the best movie ever made is The Clockwork Orange, such a gruesomely true movie (not the treatment part of it...).	5.0	BLU RAY? Not.....	2010-09-25	18	6	12

0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1TOML01ZYPUFR	"Zachary S. Houp ""RAREfiend"""	Shawshank, externally, is nothing spectacular. There've been prison movies in the past; we can expect more in the future.  What makes Shawshank any different is that it puts magic--perhaps the most foreign of elements, considering the setting--into the film.  It doesn't break any new ground, and the story isn't particularly awe inspiring, but where this film represents a model for cinema production is that it shows that Heart is of more importance than glitz; in short, it shows the faults of Hollywood by doing the opposite.It is my favorite movie, because I am Andy Dufresne.  I bet every person who watches it becomes Andy Dufresne.  We all feel imprisoned and we want to get out, but Life, society, puts the bars around us all.  Andy is just unique enough to be the outsider, and just normal enough to be the spokesperson for a species.There is a joke in Shawshank: &quot;Everyone here is innocent; everybody knows that.&quot;  With the exception of &quot;The Sisters,&quot; I defy a person to show me a character in Shawshank who is a criminal at heart.  They may have done the crime, they are, of course, doing the time, but just which character in the prison is someone that a regular, &quot;law-abiding&quot; man or woman would be afraid of.  The inmates at Shawshank are no different than you or I.They are innocent men, caught in a cruel world; at the forefront is an innocent INNOCENT man driven down beyond what, for most, would be intolerable.  How can the viewer do anything but sympathize, when it is his own face he sees though the slats of the bars, whose own picture bares the bright, red words &quot;Parole Rejected&quot; on it.  You can't punish someone you love so fiercely.And then there is Hope, which takes a mind of its own in Shawshank.  People--you, me--have been overpowered before by what we consider to be the injustice of society, but we live on and live again.  For some, life ends in a cell--to live again is to break from prison or relinquish one's grasp of his own soul.  As we stand (Andy united), we hold on dearly for the soul, and we encourage our hero to do the same.  If he loses hope, so too shall we.What the filmmakers of Shawshank have created is Life, at its lowest--but only temporarily.  It contradicts what people consider right, wrong, good, bad, and leaves them with their inner villain, the prisoner we all harbor, the Andy Dufresne in anticipation for escape.  This movie is OUR release from all that we fear and all that oppresses us.  Watching yourself on screen becomes the most intimate cinema experience of a lifetime.  Feeling yourself escape becomes the most important experience of a life.	5.0	Why This Is My Favorite Movie of All Time	2001-11-02	1	1	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3S98L5B1SR9P1	Zack H.	This film is truly a masterpiece. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were great and delivered perfect performances. Andy is sent to prison for life, and thus begins his journey which is an uphill struggle all the way. It's a very moving film, told from the perspective of Red, another convicted murderer and Andy's best friend, whose first impression of Andy is that a stiff breeze would blow him over. As time progresses though, Andy's values of hope have an impact on Red who develops a better understanding and different perspective on things. When I first saw it, I was overwhelmed. It should have done way better in the oscars. This is one of the best films I have ever seen and would strongly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it. I've seen it at least 400 bajillion times (much thanks to TNT) but wouldn't hesitate to pop in the DVD and watch it again if prompted. Tim Robbins (Andy) and Morgan Freeman (Red) are great. They play truly believable parts. Andy, Red, and the rest of the prison crew are people that you grow to like at an early point in the movie and you really hope that things turn out okay for them. When a filmmaker makes you really feel for the characters he's done his job. It appeals to every type of movie, it's suspenseful, it's funny, it's even romantic (in a friendship sort of way), it's just a great drama. The poor guy goes through so much just to get his freedom and to be right. You have to see it to believe it.	5.0	The Shawshank Redemption	2005-07-13	2	2	0
0780623134	The Shawshank Redemption (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A29Q86RGEJ7SM	Zana	I've seen this movie on television several times and enjoyed it greatly.  A good story of triumph over adversity, however when I purchased the video I was greatly disappointed because the notorious &quot; F &quot; word ruined the writing for me and the acting as far as I'm concerened.  Thats all I could see or hear and it ruined the quality of the movie for me, my husband didn't even enjoy it as much.  It's a shame that a briliiant actor and director had to fall victum to the use of vile language when it was proven by the television version that it was completely unnecessary to the impact and story line.	2.0	The &quot;F&quot; Word  Strikes Again	2001-05-29	67	3	64

I agree with them. Frank Darabont (Green Mile, The Mist) wrote and directed this film with a great cast. Highly recommended.	5.0	"This HD film is based on the Stephen King story ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"""	2013-04-05	0	0	0
